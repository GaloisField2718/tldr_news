### [Language models for planning (24 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Language models for planning (24 minute read)

Language models are great at producing plausible text and in certain cases reasonable plans. However, in general, they fail to generate long horizon plans. Without changing the model at all, even via fine-tuning, with special prompts we can dramatically improve the success of both plan generation and plan execution. Specifically, language models generate a plan language (fed a few-shot example) and that plan is executed by an actual planner then the resulting plans are translated back to natural language. The improvement is massive.

### [Machine Translation Needs Attention (12 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Machine Translation Needs Attention (12 minute read)

The Structured State Spaces for Sequences (S4) model, successful in various tasks, is applied to Machine Translation (MT), but lags behind the Transformer by 4 BLEU points and struggles with long sentences. This gap is attributed to S4's inability to summarize full source sentences in a single hidden state, which can be remedied by introducing an attention mechanism.

## Article 6
### [How to train LLMs to be competent and ethical (36 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 How to train LLMs to be competent and ethical (36 minute read)

One negative side effect of training agents to maximize reward is that they often become power seeking, meaning they try to increase their resources and access to information. This is a novel finding and somewhat hard to measure, this paper introduces a benchmark to help understand the power seeking behavior of these language models. Additionally, they give insights on how to train models to both act with high utility and according to moral guidelines. The world needs more high quality benchmarks and this is an excellent step in that direction.

### [DeepFloyd IF code released (GitHub Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 DeepFloyd IF code released (GitHub Repo)

The next image model from Stability AI has a code release. The model weights, blog, inference, and tooling will be coming in a few days. It is a multi-stage model with a frozen T5 text encoder and two super resolution models. One big win here is the ability to render extremely high quality text. The claim is that this model will likely be for research only at first, then open after some community feedback.

### [167k patent summaries (HuggingFace Dataset)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 167k patent summaries (HuggingFace Dataset)

PMC-Patients is a unique dataset that includes 167,000 patient summaries extracted from case reports in PubMed Central (PMC), along with 3.1 million patient-article relevance and 293,000 patient-patient similarity annotations. The dataset is intended for use in Retrieval-based Clinical Decision Support (ReCDS) systems and includes two benchmark tasks: Patient-to-Article Retrieval (PAR) and Patient-to-Patient Retrieval (PPR). The details on the tasks and leaderboards can be found in the paper.

### [PoseVocab: Learning Pose Embeddings for Human Avatar Modeling (5 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 PoseVocab: Learning Pose Embeddings for Human Avatar Modeling (5 minute read)

PoseVocab, a novel pose encoding method for human avatar modeling, constructs key poses and latent embeddings to effectively encode dynamic human appearances and achieve pose generalization and temporal consistency. The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in synthesis quality through the use of feature lines, a compact 3D representation, and a hierarchical query strategy for interpolating pose embeddings.
