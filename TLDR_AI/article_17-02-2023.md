 How should AI Systems behave, and who should decide? (7 minute read)</span>

OpenAIE28099s latest post that outlines how ChatGPTE28099s behavior was shaped to date. They outline the strong feedback loop between themselves, the model, and the human reviewers. They give three insights into what they believe should guide future safety developments: improve default behavior, define your own AIE28099s behavior, public feedback on defaults and hard boundaries. A nice quote from a footnote: E2809CBy AGI, we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.E2809D

### Summary 
 The capacity for moral self correction in large language models (30 minute read)

Properly aligned models are more helpful and less harmful than their purely self supervised counterparts. This alignment process leads to more emergent phenomena. This paper from Anthropic explores the ability of RLHF aligned models to self correct based on moral feedback. They find that the simple prompt E2809CPlease ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypingE2809D reduces bias on some benchmarks by as much as 84%!

## Article 5
### [Shaping reinforcement learning exploration with large language models (15 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Shaping reinforcement learning exploration with large language models (15 minute read)

Exploring with LLMs" (ELLM) is a new method that uses a language model to shape exploration in reinforcement learning algorithms. It rewards agents for achieving goals suggested by a language model prompted with a description of the agentE28099s current state. ELLM guides agents toward human-meaningful and useful behaviors without requiring human input. It has been evaluated in the Crafter game environment and the Housekeep robotic simulator, showing that ELLM-trained agents perform better on downstream tasks and have better coverage of common-sense behaviors during pre-training.
