 Brave Search launches an AI-powered summarization feature (3 minute read)

It is raining AI-powered features all across search engines. Brave Search launched a new E2809CSummarizerE2809D feature, which is powered by different large language models (LLMs) E28094 OpenAIE28099s GPT tech isnE28099t one of them. Just like the name suggests, its job is to provide a synopsis of a search query using different sources. The summary feature is available to all Brave Search users on desktop and mobile E28094 accessible through any browser.

### Summary 
 100 most cited AI papers in 2022 (6 minute read)

Google still holds the top spot in AI research and UC Berkeley has that honor among academic groups. Given the volume of papers from groups like Google and Deepmind, it is impressive to see much smaller groups have far fewer but potentially more impactful papers.

 200-year-old math opens up AIE28099s mysterious black box (4 minute read)

Whether itE28099s designing microchips or dreaming up new proteins, sometimes it seems like neural networks can do anything. Infamously, however, these brain-inspired AI systems work in mysterious ways, raising concerns that what they are doing might not make any sense. New research suggests that 200-year-old math could help shed light on how neural networks perform complex tasks such as predicting climate or modeling turbulence, a new study finds. This in turn could help boost the accuracy of neural networks and the speed at which they learn, researchers say.

### Summary 
 A better of understanding of diffusion through the lens of ELBO maximization (22 minute read)

Diffusion is currently one of the best generative methods in terms of sample quality. This comes from the nice properties of the loss and denoising process. In the community, different weighting schemes are used for noise per step which leads to different empirical results. It turns out that these non-uniform weighting schemes can be understood from the lens of likelihood maximization. This is a great step towards a deeper theoretical understanding of this modern workhorse.

### Summary 
 Guide text generation with grounding for robotic control (7 minute read)

Applying large language models to robots is challenging due to their lack of experience with the physical world. To overcome this, a guided decoding strategy is used to construct an action sequence that is both likely according to the language model and realizable in the environment. This strategy solves complex tasks in a robotic setting by leveraging the knowledge of both models. They compare their work to SayCan.

### [Unlimited-Size Diffusion Restoration (12 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Unlimited-Size Diffusion Restoration (12 minute read)

This paper discusses the use of diffusion models for zero-shot image restoration and proposes a method to handle images of arbitrary sizes while maintaining the excellent characteristics of zero-shot. The proposed method, called Mask-Shift Restoration, addresses local incoherence, and Hierarchical Restoration alleviates out-of-domain issues. These simple, parameter-free approaches can be used not only for image restoration but also for image generation of unlimited sizes.

### Summary 
 Interested in speeding up multiGPU training? Gradient accumulation is your bottleneck (6 minute read)

Distributed Pytorch can be immensely slow if youE28099re not careful. When running a model on multiple GPUs, you take the average of all the gradient updates at a predefined interval. However, if youE28099re not careful, your code will be synchronizing across GPUs for every backwards pass.

### Summary 
 Early Dropout for Mitigating Underfitting in Neural Networks (Github Repo)

The study shows that early dropout, applied only during the initial phases of training, can mitigate underfitting by reducing the directional variance of gradients and aligning them with the entire datasetE28099s gradient. The proposed method consistently improves generalization accuracy in various vision tasks and encourages further research on regularization in deep learning.

### [Context Clusters: A New Paradigm for Visual Representation (Github Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Context Clusters: A New Paradigm for Visual Representation (Github Repo)

This work introduces Context Clusters (CoCs), a new paradigm for visual representation that views an image as a set of unorganized points and extracts features via a simplified clustering algorithm. CoCs are convolution- and attention-free and only rely on clustering for spatial interaction. Despite not targeting state-of-the-art performance, CoCs achieve comparable or even better results than ConvNets or ViTs on several benchmarks.
