### Summary 
 Artist rejects photo prize after AI-generated image wins award (5 minute read)

German artist Boris Eldagsen rejected an award from the Sony World Photography Award after revealing that his submission, "Pseudomnesia: The Electrician," was generated by AI. Eldagsen hoped that his actions would prompt a conversation around AI-generated images and encourage separate competitions for such works. The World Photography Organisation, which runs the competition, stated that they recognized the importance of AI and its impact on image-making but emphasized that the awards would continue to focus on championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium.

### Summary 
 Viral AI-powered Drake and The Weeknd song is removed from streaming services (4 minute read)

An AI-voiced rap song imitating the voices of Drake and The Weeknd was removed from streaming services due to a copyright claim by Universal Music Group (UMG). The anonymous musician, ghostwriter, used AI to create the vocals for the song "heart on my sleeve." UMG recently urged streaming platforms to ban AI programs from using copyrighted music for training purposes. Media lawyer Edward Klaris explained that the song potentially infringes on the artists' right of publicity, but the legality of using copyrighted songs to train AI models remains uncertain.

## Article 4
### [Learning to Compress Prompts with Gist Tokens (7 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Learning to Compress Prompts with Gist Tokens (7 minute read)

A new technique called "gisting" has been introduced as a way to utilize multitask capabilities of language models without requiring prompts or model retraining for each task. Gisting compresses prompts into smaller sets of tokens that can be reused, resulting in computational efficiency, FLOP reductions, and speedups without significant loss in output quality. This technique was tested on two LMs, achieving up to 26x compression of prompts and up to 40% FLOPs reductions.

## Article 5
### [DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection (7 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection (7 minute read)

A new real-time end-to-end object detector called Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR) has been proposed to address the high computational cost issue of end-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs), which limits their practical application. RT-DETR uses an efficient hybrid encoder, IoU-aware query selection, and supports flexible adjustment of inference speed without retraining. RT-DETR achieves up to 54.8% AP on COCO val2017 and 74 FPS on T4 GPU, outperforming YOLO detectors and DINO-Deformable-DETR-R50 in both speed and accuracy.

### [Street Fighter AI (GitHub Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Street Fighter AI (GitHub Repo)

There has been recent work in making RL agents less afraid. One paper specifically talks about mitigating cowardice in models trained in RL. This is interesting in the realm of self-driving cars and terrifying in other potential applications. This repository shows how we can now train RL agents to win in a fighting game. The full training and evaluation code is available.

## Article 7
### [Auto Evaluator (GitHub Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Auto Evaluator (GitHub Repo)

There is a task in ML called E2809CQuestion AnsweringE2809D which tries to automate the processes of responding to questions with proper answers. There are certain things that make this challenging such as determining factuality or handling rephrasings. This tool uses a language model to automate the generation and answering of questions. This follows the trend in language models today where it is easier for them to verify that something is correct rather than generate the correct thing.
