## Article 5
### [Predict Video Content by Separating Motion and Appearance (18 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Predict Video Content by Separating Motion and Appearance (18 minute read)<br>Predicting video content is tricky because the system must guess object movements and keep them looking consistent. This new system, MMVP, separately handles motion and appearance using special "motion matrices" that focus just on movement. This method is not only more accurate but also more efficient and compact than current top systems.

### [How Feedback Affects LLMs? (GitHub Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 How Feedback Affects LLMs? (GitHub Repo)When training large language models to understand and match human values, do we use scores (rating) or comparisons (ranking) as feedback? This study found that the choice matters a lot. For instance, models trained with rankings are preferred when evaluated by comparison but not always by scoring. This shows that how we choose to give feedback has big implications for how well the model works in real-life situations.

### [OpenAI base models are not sycophantic (5 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 OpenAI base models are not sycophantic (5 minute read)Inverse scaling problems are things that get worse as model size increases. Sycophancy is when a model tends to agree with a human regardless of the truth. Anthropic released great work recently that showed larger models are more sycophantic. However, recent experiments show that OpenAI models donE28099t suffer from this same problem.
