### Summary 
 HiPer: Personalizing Image Generation and Manipulation with Highly Personalized Text Embedding (12 minute read)

The paper presents a new approach called HiPer, which uses highly personalized text embedding to achieve personalization and content manipulation in image generation and manipulation without the need for model fine-tuning or identifiers. The approach enables manipulation of background, texture, and motion with just a single image and target text, producing highly personalized and complex semantic image edits across a wide range of tasks. The authors believe that their novel understanding of the text embedding space has the potential to inspire further research across various tasks.

### Summary 
 DreamBooth3D: Personalizing Text-to-3D Generative Models with Few Images (5 minute read)

DreamBooth3D is a new approach that personalizes text-to-3D generative models with as few as 3-6 casually captured images of a subject. The method combines recent advances in personalizing text-to-image models with text-to-3D generation, overcoming the issue of overfitting to input viewpoints through a 3-stage optimization strategy. DreamBooth3D can produce high-quality, subject-specific 3D assets with text-driven modifications such as novel poses, colors, and attributes that are not seen in any of the input images of the subject.
