### Summary 
 Why Transformative AI Is Really, Really Hard To Achieve (21 minute read)While humans have a good track record of innovation, the trend growth rate of GDP per capita has never exceeded three percent per year. There has yet to be a technology that breaks the three percent threshold. Only strong evidence should cause us to expect anything different. AI is likely transformative in the same way that the internet was, but it has many hurdles in the way to the accelerating growth rates predicted by some.

### [Machine learning for polynomial equations (37 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Machine learning for polynomial equations (37 minute read)Solving systems of polynomial equations sometimes results in singularities which are poorly behaved points. There are certain resolution strategies which allow for solutions at these points. Resolution is a challenging process, but if you frame it as a game and apply RL, you can achieve impressive performance.

### [AI, Ozymandias (15 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 AI, Ozymandias (15 minute read)In the late 19th century, there was a widespread belief that human knowledge was nearing completion. This was due to rapid progress in science and technology, particularly in physics and biology. However, this confidence was misplaced, as new discoveries soon overturned many of the old assumptions. Freddie DeBoer argues that we are currently seeing a similar recurrence of hubris in AI. While AI has achieved impressive results in recent years, it is important to remember that it is still a very young field with much that we do not understand. We should be wary of making grandiose claims about AI's potential, as we may eventually be proven wrong in the same way that the late Victorians were.
