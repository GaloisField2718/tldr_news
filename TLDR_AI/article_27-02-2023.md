### Summary 
 Planning for AGI and beyond (7 minute read)

OpenAI outlines steps they have taken and plan to take in their ultimate goal to create AGI. They outline a fairly ambitious future and explain that future releases of these models might be slower and more cautious. They hint that they believe ChatGPT to be a stepping stone towards AGI. Examples of efforts they have undertaken are included in the article.

### Summary 
 Meta releases LLaMA, a state-of-the-art foundational large language model (5 minute read)

Meta has publicly released a new large language model called LLaMA, which is designed to help researchers advance their work in the AI subfield of natural language processing (NLP). LLaMA is available in various sizes and is a foundational model that can be fine-tuned for different tasks. By releasing LLaMA, Meta hopes to democratize access to large language models, allowing more researchers to study and test new approaches in this field.

### [Aligning Text-to-Image models using human feedback (34 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Aligning Text-to-Image models using human feedback (34 minute read)

In this work we see additional evidence that alignment improves capabilities. Previous research seems to have mostly been focused on capabilities that are weakly aligned to human preference (e.g., improving FID or SOTA on a benchmark). Now, however, we find that if we train a reward model on human feedback data, our models become significantly more useful. They outline a E2809Creward weighted likelihood maximizationE2809D scheme. Their experiments are constrained to categories of count, color, and background.

### [New E2809COpenE2809D foundation models from Meta (30 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 New E2809COpenE2809D foundation models from Meta (30 minute read)

Meta has trained 4 powerful language models on a Trillion tokens. They find that many of the modern advances such as pre-layernorm, SwiGLU, and Rotary embeddings improve their modelE28099s performance. Additionally, they outline the training mix and compute power used to train these models. They used 2048 A100 GPUs for 5 months over the course of this project, with the largest model taking 21 days to train on their whole cluster.

## Article 6
### [Civitai (GitHub Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Civitai (GitHub Repo)

The goal of Civitai is to create a platform where people can share their stable diffusion models (textual inversions, hypernetworks, aesthetic gradients, VAEs, and any other crazy stuff people do to customize their AI generations), collaborate with others to improve them, and learn from each other's work. The platform allows users to create an account, upload their models, and browse models that have been shared by others. Users can also leave comments and feedback on each other's models to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Article 7
### [Composer: A Large Controllable Diffusion Model for Infinite Image Generation and Manipulation (GitHub Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Composer: A Large Controllable Diffusion Model for Infinite Image Generation and Manipulation (GitHub Repo)

Composer is a large (5 billion parameters) controllable diffusion model trained on billions of (text, image) pairs. It can exponentially expand the control space through composition, leading to an enormous number of ways to generate and manipulate images, i.e., making the infinite use of finite means.

### Summary 
 Everyday Robotics layoffs (2 minute read)

Another unfortunate casualty from recent layoffs, everyday robotics which developed industry leading cleaning and trash sorting robots is disbanded. One of the E2809Cother betsE2809D that lost $6B last year, Everyday Robotics was a graduate from AlphabetE28099s X E2809CmoonshotE2809D program. Some of the research will be continued inside of Google robotics.
