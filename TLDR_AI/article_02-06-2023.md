### [Baidu Rolls Out AI Venture Fund (1 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Baidu Rolls Out AI Venture Fund (1 minute read)Chinese tech giant Baidu is rolling out a 1 billion yuan ($145 million) AI venture fund to back startups focused on content generated by artificial intelligence applications. The fund will also launch a competition for developers who build applications off Baidu's ERNIE large language model (LLM) or integrate the model into their existing products.

### [Using GoogleE28099s code history to write more code (12 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Using GoogleE28099s code history to write more code (12 minute read)Google has recorded every change to its code base for decades, including rich descriptions, changes, and fixes. They treat this as a sequence modeling problem and create a set of robust internal tools that can help software engineers be more productive. They find it to be surprisingly effective, even at novel tasks like E2809Chistory informed generationE2809D.

## Article 3
### [Intriguing properties of quantization at scale (28 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Intriguing properties of quantization at scale (28 minute read)WeE28099ve talked about precision before, thatE28099s how much space it takes to store a number. And how many unique values that number can represent. When you reduce the precision, AI models take less space on the computer, but weird things start to happen because you represent fewer numbers for the parameters. This paper studies what happens when you quantize before training at scale. They start to poke at the magical 6B parameter performance barrier.

## Article 4
### [GeneFace++: Generalized and Stable Real-Time Audio-Driven 3D Talking Face Generation (13 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 GeneFace++: Generalized and Stable Real-Time Audio-Driven 3D Talking Face Generation (13 minute read)Creating realistic talking digital people that sync with any speech audio is an important challenge in the digital world. GeneFace++ is a new method that improves lip-syncing, video quality, and system efficiency, making it the first of its kind to achieve real-time talking face generation.

## Article 5
### [Cost-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Compact Models (17 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Cost-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Compact Models (17 minute read)Large AI models can be expensive and bad for the environment, so researchers have found a more efficient way to create smaller models using a method called knowledge distillation. This approach is often better than spending money on extra data and helps create compact models that still perform well in various language tasks.

## Article 6
### [Autonomous Driving with Multi-Camera Unified Pre-training (GitHub Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Autonomous Driving with Multi-Camera Unified Pre-training (GitHub Repo)<br>This research introduces 'Occ-BEV', a new pre-training method for autonomous driving that focuses on making better use of multiple camera views, rather than just one, thus capturing a more accurate understanding of the surrounding environment. The technique uses a unique 3D decoder to predict the 3D geometry of the environment.

## Article 7
### [GPT4Tools: Controlling Visual Foundation Models (GitHub Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 GPT4Tools: Controlling Visual Foundation Models (GitHub Repo)The new GPT4Tools system can manage multiple visual foundation models by analyzing language content, allowing it to automatically decide, control, and use different models based on the user's needs during a conversation. Uniquely, it enables users to teach their own language model how to use tools more effectively using a simple self-instruction and LoRA approach, making conversations about image-related tasks much smoother and more efficient.
