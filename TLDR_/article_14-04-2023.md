### Summary 
 AWS Bedrock (11 minute read)

Amazon has announced a new service for AWS called Bedrock that allows you to use foundation models from various companies such as anthropic and stability AI. The idea is to take an open model and bring your data (just point it to s3). There's been a lot of discussion recently around data privacy and security, with this service it might be possible to run the models in your own infra in AWS which is attractive from a privacy perspective. Amazon also announced two new models and free access to their code model for individual developers.
