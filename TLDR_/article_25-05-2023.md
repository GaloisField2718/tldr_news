### [Snowflake acquires Neeva to bring intelligent search to its cloud data management solution (5 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Snowflake acquires Neeva to bring intelligent search to its cloud data management solution (5 minute read)

Cloud data management company, Snowflake, has acquired Neeva, a startup focused on AI-powered search. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Founded by ex-Google employees, Neeva had originally worked on both consumer and enterprise search tools, but recently pivoted exclusively towards enterprise solutions. With Neeva's generative AI search expertise, Snowflake plans to enhance its data discovery capabilities, making search more intelligent and interactive at scale.

## Article 5
### [QLoRA 65B parameter models fine-tuned on 48GB GPU (32 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 QLoRA 65B parameter models fine-tuned on 48GB GPU (32 minute read)

LoRA is a way to fine-tune models much more cheaply than full fine-tuning. It works by just updating a small, carefully selected, subset of the model. However, even then it is often too expensive to fine-tune large (more than 13B parameter) models on commodity hardware. Quantization reduces the precision of parameters in the model which in turn takes less space. More great open source progress.

## Article 6
### [SEAHORSE: A Tool for Evaluating Multilingual Summarization Systems (9 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 SEAHORSE: A Tool for Evaluating Multilingual Summarization Systems (9 minute read)

SEAHORSE is a dataset created to assess the quality of summarization systems in multiple languages. It contains 96,000 summaries that have been rated by humans based on six important aspects: clarity, repetition, grammar, attribution, main ideas, and conciseness. This dataset not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of automated metrics but also provides a valuable resource for training such metrics, helping researchers advance the field of multilingual summarization evaluation.

## Article 7
### [Meta-in-Context Learning: Recursive Improvement of Large Language Models (12 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Meta-in-Context Learning: Recursive Improvement of Large Language Models (12 minute read)

This paper introduces meta-in-context learning, a recursive self-improvement process for large language models. By studying regression and decision-making tasks, the researchers demonstrate that meta-in-context learning enhances the models' in-context learning abilities, modifies their strategies, and achieves competitive performance on real-world problems. This work sheds light on improving language models without relying solely on traditional fine-tuning approaches.

## Article 8
### [ControlVideo: Text-to-Video Generation with Improved Consistency and Quality (GitHub Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 ControlVideo: Text-to-Video Generation with Improved Consistency and Quality (GitHub Repo)

ControlVideo is a novel framework that addresses the limitations of generating videos from text by introducing a training-free approach. By leveraging structural consistency, enhancing appearance coherence, mitigating flicker effects, and employing hierarchical sampling, ControlVideo outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality videos that are both short and long. Importantly, ControlVideo achieves these results efficiently, generating videos within minutes using a single NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU.
