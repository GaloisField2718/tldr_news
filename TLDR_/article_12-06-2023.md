## Article 1
### [Meta leads open-source AI with new text-to-music model (4 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Meta leads open-source AI with new text-to-music model (4 minute read)CEO Mark Zuckerburg recently discussed his goals with open-sourcing significant expensive AI tools in a podcast. This collection of music generation code, model weights, and evaluations is an example of just that. It allows you to generate both melody conditioned and text conditioned music. The code is fully open sourced, but model weights are not commercially open.

## Article 2
### [Stable Diffusion Takes Stereotypes To The Extreme (15 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Stable Diffusion Takes Stereotypes To The Extreme (15 minute read)Bloomberg journalists found that Stable Diffusion takes racial and gender disparities to extremes that are even worse than those found in the real world, stroking fears that generative AI will perpetuate biases.

## Article 3
### [Khan Academy Khanmigo (6 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Khan Academy Khanmigo (6 minute read)Khan Academy has introduced an AI-powered chatbot, Khanmigo, which aims to provide personalized tutoring to students. Powered by GPT-4, the bot offers guidance on a broad range of subjects and uses the Socratic method to encourage learners to solve their problems independently. While proponents believe such bots could revolutionize education, concerns about the technology's potential for error and impact on teachers' roles persist and its effectiveness is currently being studied ahead of a broader rollout in U.S. schools.

## Article 4
### [New multimodal text/vision model from Singapore (7 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 New multimodal text/vision model from Singapore (7 minute read)A lot of new acronyms are introduced in this work. The gist is that researchers collected a new dataset for visual instruction tuning, trained a model, and made some algorithmic tweaks along the way. The demo is really impressive, especially after the AR reveal from Apple. An exciting peak at what AI assistants might look like in the future.

## Article 5
### [Making language models more truthful at test time (28 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Making language models more truthful at test time (28 minute read)Language models are well known for confidently confabulating (sometimes called hallucinating). It turns out that these models have an internal representation for truthfulness and by tweaking the model activations you can elicit a truthful response. The researchers found that by using this technique on the instruction-tuned Alpaca model, they improved TruthfulQA performance from 32.5% to 65.1%.

## Article 6
### [SpQR: A Technique for High-Efficiency LLM Compression (19 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 SpQR: A Technique for High-Efficiency LLM Compression (19 minute read)<br>The paper presents Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new format and technique that allows almost lossless compression of large language models (LLMs), overcoming the usual accuracy losses from quantization. SpQR enables powerful LLMs to run on common devices like laptops and mobile phones without performance degradation, offering over 4x memory compression gains and faster inference than traditional methods.

## Article 7
### [Matte Anything (GitHub Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Matte Anything (GitHub Repo)Advances in computer vision seemed to slow after autonomous vehicle research lost some steam, but things are picking up again. This novel technique uses a hydra of three image models to enhance the performance of natural image matting. The results are quite compelling.

## Article 8
### [Breakthrough in dense pixel wise tracking, even with occlusions (4 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Breakthrough in dense pixel wise tracking, even with occlusions (4 minute read)In 2015, there was a breakthrough in representing continuous values with a 6D number. This work rhymes in that they propose representing videos as a 3D volume. By matching between that representation and pixel space, they can perform quite long term tracking of arbitrary pixels in a video.

## Article 9
### [Lanarky (GitHub Repo)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Lanarky (GitHub Repo)Lanarky is an open-source framework to deploy LLM applications in production.

## Article 10
### [LLMs Are Good At Playing You (5 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 LLMs Are Good At Playing You (5 minute read)

## Article 11
### [Congress To Consider Two New AI Bills (2 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Congress To Consider Two New AI Bills (2 minute read)U.S. senators introduced two separate bipartisan artificial intelligence bills on Thursday amid growing interest in addressing issues surrounding the technology. One would require the U.S. government to be transparent when using AI to interact with people and the other would establish an office to determine if the United States is remaining competitive in the latest technologies.

## Article 12
### [Hey, Alexa, What Should Students Learn About AI? (8 minute read)](https://tldr.tech)
### Summary 
 Hey, Alexa, What Should Students Learn About AI? (8 minute read)Tech giants, universities, and nonprofits are working to provide lessons on artificial intelligence to students in schools. There is currently no national consensus on what should be taught about the technology. Current curriculums cover a range of topics, from the basics of AI to how to program Alexa.
