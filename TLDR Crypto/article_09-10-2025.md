MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE'S BASE BEGINS FORMAL TOKEN AND GOVERNANCE PLANNING (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Coinbase's Base team has posted a new opening for a “token &
governance research specialist,” signaling active work on a
potential token launch and decentralization roadmap. The role will
design token goals, draft a “Base constitution,” and define
governance processes balancing community participation with long-term
network growth. This follows comments from Jesse Pollak and Brian
Armstrong that Base is “exploring” a native token to accelerate
decentralization, marking a shift from earlier plans to rely solely on
ETH as gas. 

 BITWISE SETS ULTRA-LOW 0.20% FEE FOR SOLANA STAKING ETF (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Bitwise has priced its upcoming Solana Staking ETF at a 0.20% annual
fee, lower than analysts expected and matching the fee range of
approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The filing comes as the SEC's
review of new crypto ETFs stalls amid a US government shutdown, while
competitors like 21Shares are adding staking features and fee waivers
to attract investors.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING KLYRA: THE FUTURE OF TRADING (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Klyra is a meta-layer trading platform routing orders across multiple
exchanges for best execution rather than operating its own exchange,
solving the problem where traders using single exchanges suffer worse
execution, higher fees, and limited asset selection, like OKX lacking
ENA perpetuals despite otherwise strong performance. The platform
enables instant cross-exchange trading through internal transfers
processing sub-second versus 15-60 minute deposits, using
custodian-agnostic working capital deployment to aggregate liquidity
across venues, including Hyperliquid, without requiring custom
integrations. Advanced Conditional Orders allow traders to set
arbitrary verifiable conditions like rate cuts, ETF announcements, or
inflation data to automatically open trades, while Klyra Data
aggregates cross-exchange order books, economic data, news, and
asset-specific information, including tokenomics and unlock schedules
in one interface. The platform plans integration with Patagon for
private market access to companies like OpenAI and SpaceX, enabling
traders to borrow against secondary positions and hedge correlated
exposures, while positioning for the convergence of crypto and
traditional markets as the US moves toward legalizing perpetual
futures and specialized exchanges fragment across asset classes
requiring unified margin account solutions. 

 UNICORN: THE NEXT LAUNCH MODEL FOR VIRTUALS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Virtuals is launching Unicorn to replace its Genesis model that
became dominated by point farming rather than genuine conviction,
creating a system where founders pay 100 $VIRTUAL to create launches
that start at low valuations with 24-hour evaluation windows and
anti-sniper taxes declining from 99% to 1% to prevent bot
manipulation. The new model reserves 50% of supply for founding teams
with performance-tied fundraising where 25% distributes linearly only
after reaching 2M FDV through automatic limit-sells up to 160M FDV,
ensuring founders receive proceeds based on market traction rather
than promises, while the remaining 25% unlocks after one year with
six-month vesting or upon reaching 160M FDV. Every Unicorn launch
allocates 5% to ecosystem participants through weekly airdrops, with
2% going to $VIRTUAL stakers and 3% to active ecosystem users,
transitioning away from the old points system that enabled farming
behavior toward rewarding genuine long-term conviction and
co-ownership of AI agents.

 THE LIQUIDITY PROBLEM IN PREDICTION MARKETS (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Prediction markets suffer from adverse selection, where informed
traders with perfect information can gap prices 30+ cents instantly,
leaving market makers holding worthless inventory with no hedging
options, unlike traditional markets, where defensive strategies exist.
The problem stems from toxic counterparties having sufficient capital
to clear entire order books across multiple platforms simultaneously,
creating scenarios where market makers face unlimited losses against
insiders who essentially "see their hand" in poker terms, making
liquidity provision unprofitable and driving providers away. Unlike
crypto spot markets, where market makers can hedge on alternative
venues or Indian index options, where massive retail flow compensates
for occasional toxic losses, prediction markets lack sufficient retail
volume to offset gap losses while offering no effective hedging
mechanisms when informed traders move prices to 100% certainty. The
current binary, instant-liquidity primitive exemplified by Polymarket
creates unsolvable adverse selection where market makers must either
widen spreads dramatically or stop providing liquidity entirely during
high-risk periods, leading to the liquidity death spiral that
constrains prediction market growth despite their theoretical
advantages over traditional sportsbooks. 

 FUSAKA BANDWIDTH ESTIMATION (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum's upcoming Fusaka fork introduces PeerDAS, splitting blobs
into 128 columns so nodes custody data proportional to stake, creating
three roles (supernodes, validators, and full nodes) and enabling an
8x theoretical scaling limit with erasure coding. Devnet tests suggest
the BPO schedule to 10 and 14 target blobs keeps validating nodes
within EIP-7870 limits at roughly 17–25 Mb/s, while supernodes
absorb heavier peaks and features like distributed blob building, MEV
relays, and a max-blobs flag mitigate proposer bandwidth.

 STABLECOINS CROSS $200B: THE END OF BANKING MONOPOLY (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Stablecoins crossing $200 billion represents the separation of dollar
hegemony from American banking distribution, enabling 8 billion humans
to custody dollars without permission, bank accounts, or touching the
US banking system in what constitutes the most important geopolitical
money shift since Bretton Woods. Three second-order effects emerge:
capital controls becoming ineffective as governments cannot trap what
they cannot custody or sanction seed phrases, the $150 billion annual
remittance extraction flipping to near-zero cost and staying in
emerging economies, and central banks forced to compete for citizens
who can exit bad monetary policy in 30 seconds, making inflation a
customer retention problem. The shift eliminates rent-seeking
infrastructure, including correspondent banking's 47-intermediary fee
maze and T+2 settlement delays that were always artificial complexity
for float extraction, with traditional players like Stripe, PayPal,
Visa, and BlackRock now building rather than resisting as the debate
ends and deployment begins. 

 THE REAL ALT SEASON IS IN CRYPTO EQUITIES (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Bitcoin dominance sits at 58% in a steady uptrend since November 2022
without the historical pattern where Bitcoin appreciation precedes
altcoin outperformance, suggesting alt season is occurring in crypto
equities rather than crypto assets as institutions deploy fresh
capital into familiar accessible formats. Crypto equities show
dramatic outperformance with Coinbase up 53% YTD, Robinhood up 299%,
Galaxy up 100%, and Circle up 368% since its June IPO, compared to
Bitcoin's 31%, Ethereum's 35%, and Solana's 21% gains over the same
period. Institutional capital flows into equities rather than crypto
assets because institutions already have operational infrastructure
for custody, compliance, and dealer relationships, while purchasing
crypto tokens requires new capabilities that may fall outside their
mandates entirely. The crypto equities alt season shares
characteristics with historical crypto alt seasons including asset
concentration with only a handful of attractive equities similar to
under 100 tokens in past cycles, access to leverage through
traditional equity lending desks unlike collapsed crypto-native
lending infrastructure, and likely rotation between different equity
metas from stablecoin stocks to exchanges to digital asset treasuries
as traders take profits from expensive assets and redeploy capital.
