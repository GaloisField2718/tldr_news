INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 UNISWAP ON INTENTS BASED SYSTEMS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Uniswap Labs and Across Protocol have introduced ERC-7683, a proposed
standard to address fragmentation in intents-based systems by creating
a universal filler network. This standard aims to streamline
cross-chain transactions, improve user experience, and reduce gas fees
by allowing fillers to compete for executing orders more efficiently. 

 ROBINHOOD AND REVOLUT COULD ISSUE THEIR OWN STABLECOINS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7]

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BINANCE AND THE US APPROACH TO CRYPTO (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Binance had a lot of issues around a lack of controls and illicit
financial activities on its platform, but these problems plague any
rapidly-going financial entity in a new industry. In fact, existing
financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, paid billions of
dollars in the past few years for similar violations. Binance's CEO
faced severe penalties while similar or worse violations by
traditional banks have resulted in much smaller consequences,
suggesting a bias in how the two systems are treated. 

 THE FAT APP THESIS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Fat Protocol Thesis says that chains capture more value than apps
built on them since apps have weak moats and drive network effects to
the underlying chain. This idea has spurred L2s to raise at massive
valuations, even though they don't have valuable apps. The new ‚ÄúFat
App Thesis‚Äù is that there's outsized value to crypto apps as they
are at the end of the infrastructure boom and are beginning to have
user moats. At the same time, chains have become interchangeable and
the attention economy has been extended to web3 with a few major
winners.

 BASE MAINNET 09/21/24 INCIDENT POSTMORTEM (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Last week, the Base L2 experienced a 17-minute block-building outage
due to a misconfiguration in its newly implemented conductor sequencer
cluster. This misconfiguration resulted in a failure of leadership
transfer between sequencer instances. While the chain's integrity and
user funds remained secure, the incident highlighted the need for
improved configuration management processes and more robust failover
mechanisms. Base has committed to fixing the issue and preventing
similar problems from happening. 

 THE NEXT TEN YEARS OF SMART CONTRACT BLOCKCHAINS (3 MINUTE READ) [11]


 The first decade of smart contract blockchains was built on Bitcoin's
censorship resistance and decentralization values. As the market
matures and demands for high performance and profits increase, this
early adopter vision will likely fade and mark the ‚Äúend of the
beginning.‚Äù The commercialization of crypto will unlock more
significant opportunities for its original vision to persevere, albeit
with compromises.
