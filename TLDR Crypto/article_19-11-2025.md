MARKETS & BUSINESS

 EL SALVADOR'S $100M BITCOIN BUY REKINDLES IMF DEAL QUESTIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 El Salvador's Bitcoin Office says the government bought 1,090 BTC
worth over $100 million, lifting reserves from 5,968 to more than
7,474 BTC, despite an IMF loan program that pledged no new
public-sector BTC purchases and steps to reduce exposure. The
discrepancy between onchain reserve data and assurances in IMF filings
raises fresh concerns over how closely El Salvador is adhering to its
$1.4 billion agreement and how its Bitcoin holdings are being
reported. 

 WHITE HOUSE REVIEWING INTERNATIONAL CRYPTO TAX STANDARD (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The White House is reviewing an IRS proposal to join the Crypto-Asset
Reporting Framework, giving tax authorities access to Americans'
foreign crypto account data as 72 countries commit to implementing
CARF by 2028 to combat international tax evasion. The rule aims to
discourage Americans from moving digital assets to offshore exchanges,
while new 1099-DA forms launching in January will require US exchanges
to report detailed transaction data, including inward and outward
transfers. The IRS will soon scan blockchain networks at scale to
identify major non-reporters for audits, marking the beginning of the
end of crypto anonymity as better data integration tools come online.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 MASTERCARD BRINGS HUMAN-READABLE WALLET ALIASES TO POLYGON (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Mastercard is extending its Crypto Credential program to self-custody
wallets on Polygon, letting users link verified, human-readable
aliases or soulbound tokens to their addresses via Mercuryo to reduce
transfer errors and make crypto flows feel more like traditional
payments. The move builds on Mastercard's broader Web3 push, including
debit card partnerships with Kraken and MetaMask, plus a
Chainlink-powered integration that lets billions of cardholders buy
crypto directly onchain through partners like Swapper Finance and
ZeroHash. 

 AAVE ADDS $1M INSURANCE-BACKED PROTECTION FOR DEPOSITS (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Aave will introduce insurance-backed protection of up to $1,000,000
per eligible user inside the Aave App, shifting deposit protection
from the user to the protocol and putting DeFi on competitive footing
with fintech and traditional savings products. By bundling coverage
directly into a clean, mobile-native experience, Aave effectively
offers bank-like security with materially higher yields, creating a
globally accessible savings product that could appeal to mainstream
users, not just crypto natives.

 HOW CRYPTO EXPANDS FINANCIAL ACCESS FOR AMERICA'S UNDERBANKED (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 No group stands to benefit more from crypto than the unbanked and
underbanked, who make up 6% of US households and are
disproportionately low-income, Black, Hispanic, immigrant, or
disabled. Crypto is already being used for savings, cross-border
payments, gig-work income, and emergency remittances. Users repeatedly
describe it as faster, cheaper, and more trustworthy than banks. Many
“unbanked” Americans aren't opting out of finance, they're opting
into crypto because it delivers reliability, autonomy, and immediacy
that traditional banking has failed to provide. 

 ONCHAIN SPECULATION DASHBOARD (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Perps volumes hit $338 billion in early November, with Hyperliquid
dominating, while DEX activity peaked above $300 billion in October,
led by Solana, before recent pullbacks. Launchpads show Pump.fun
maintaining dominance despite emerging competition from Clanker and
Virtuals, as prediction markets demonstrate the strongest organic
growth with Polymarket driving consistent volume increases through
October. App-level rotation shifted from Phantom's early dominance to
Axiom's memecoin trading terminal on Solana and Coinbase's integrated
DEX on Base, while TCG and card RWAs from Courtyard and Phygitals
posted breakout volume from August through October, signaling consumer
willingness to spend on collectible RWAs.

 WHY TRUMP'S TEAM IS BETTING ON STABLECOINS (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Trump administration Fed governor Stephen Miran predicts that
stablecoin growth from $280 billion to $2-3 trillion by 2028-2030 will
create Treasury demand equivalent to one-third of Bernanke's 2005
"savings glut," potentially reducing US interest rates by 40 basis
points as the Genius Act requires a 100% liquid dollar reserve
backing. Tether and Circle already hold more Treasuries than Saudi
Arabia or Germany. Most future adoption is expected in emerging
markets that lack dollar access rather than domestically, where banks
successfully oppose yield-bearing designs that would drain deposits.
This strategy reinforces dollar hegemony against de-dollarization
pressures but leaves Europe and non-US bond markets newly vulnerable
as stablecoin adoption effectively privatizes seigniorage for global
actors. 

 MAJORS MUST LEAD AS CRYPTO SELLOFF REFLECTS MACRO REPRICING (6 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Crypto's worst-in-class asset performance stems from December
rate-cut probability collapsing from 70% to 42% within a week after
Powell walked back guidance, triggering indiscriminate selling with
GMCI-30 down 12% and BTC breaking below $100k for the first time since
May. The selloff was amplified by Q4-Q1 whale trimming pulled forward
due to four-year cycle expectations, creating self-fulfilling pressure
concentrated during US trading hours rather than fundamental
deterioration. Global easing continues with Japan preparing $110
billion stimulus, China printing, and the US QT ending next month, but
majors must reclaim their range before sentiment stabilizes, as crypto
trades entirely on macro timing rather than directional liquidity
concerns.
