MARKETS & BUSINESS

 NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE PARENT COMPANY INVESTS $2 BILLION IN
POLYMARKET (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Intercontinental Exchange, parent company of the New York Stock
Exchange, has invested $2 billion cash into Polymarket at a $9 billion
valuation, marking the prediction market's transition from niche
crypto platform to mainstream finance. The two companies will
collaborate on tokenization initiatives, and ICE will distribute
Polymarket's data. The investment capitalizes on growing prediction
market enthusiasm as Polymarket became a political reporting staple
during the 2024 election, with daily volumes peaking at $400 million,
though volumes have since normalized to $40-80 million in early
October as the platform and competitor Kalshi blur lines between
sports prediction markets and sports betting. 

 BITCOIN DIPS TO $122K AS CRYPTO RALLY GETS OVERHEATED (4 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Bitcoin pulled back 3% to $122,000 from record highs above $126,000
with major altcoins suffering steeper declines of 5-7% including XRP,
DOGE, ADA, and AVAX, as analysts warned the crypto rally shows signs
of short-term overheating following a near-vertical 16% pump off late
September lows. K33 Research noted the past week marked the strongest
BTC accumulation of the year with 63,083 BTC ($7.7 billion) added
across US ETFs, CME, and perpetual futures, surpassing May's peak and
creating elevated risk for consolidation as "similar bursts in
exposure have often coincided with local tops." The selloff rippled
through crypto stocks with Strategy down 7%, Coinbase down 4%, and
ether treasury companies Bitmine and Sharplink falling 3-7%.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BREX ANNOUNCES LAUNCH OF STABLECOIN PAYMENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Brex will become the first global corporate card to enable instant
balance payments with stablecoins, allowing business customers to
accept stablecoins with automatic USD conversion, send stablecoins
directly from USD balances, and pay card balances with digital assets
starting with USDC in the coming months. The platform addresses the
gap where stablecoins are increasingly used for cross-border business
transactions but remain unavailable at most banks and institutional
payment platforms, offering instant zero-fee payments that settle in
seconds, 24/7 global reliability with instant cross-border settlement,
and consolidated management within the existing Brex platform rather
than requiring fragmented workflows across multiple platforms. 

 INTRODUCING KEEL: SOLANA'S CAPITAL ENGINE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Keel launches as Solana's capital engine, powered by Sky (formerly
MakerDAO), to address the blockchain's liquidity sequencing challenge,
where onchain finance needs scale to attract large capital pools, but
large capital requires existing scale to deploy effectively. The
protocol serves as an onchain capital allocator with an initial $2.5
billion roadmap, utilizing over-collateralized debt and Sky's proven
infrastructure to kickstart capital allocation flywheels and provide
multiplicative force for ecosystem growth. Keel focuses on five areas:
deeper stablecoin lending markets enabling larger borrowing sizes with
greater capital efficiency, enhanced stablecoin swap depth and peg
stability, TVL bootstrapping for new issuances and DeFi products,
predictable savings yields with native staking and fee-free
redemption, and RWA support through large-scale allocation into
tokenized yield-bearing assets while improving onchain liquidity and
redemptions.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHY WE'LL SEE 1,000 STABLECOINS (AND WHY MOST WILL FAIL) (9 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Stablecoin issuance is easy, but adoption depends on leverage
(custody, UI control, and liquidity). A wave of platforms, from
wallets to exchanges, is launching their own stablecoins to capture
yield from user balances, yet most will struggle to circulate beyond
their own ecosystems. In open environments like Hyperliquid or Solana,
liquidity favors incumbents like USDC and USDT. In closed systems like
PayPal or Binance, custody gives issuers the leverage to impose
adoption. The stablecoin future may be abundant, but fragmented. 

 STABLECOINS AS EXIT TECH, BUT AN EXIT TO ETH, NOT USD? (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan expands on Aaron Wright's viral
thread, agreeing that stablecoins enable global, permissionless
custody, but warns they pose a “counter-sovereignty risk” for
nation-states. He predicts USD stablecoins will face regulatory choke
points abroad, leading to local stablecoin dominance in domestic
markets. As users recognize the geopolitical exposure of dollar-backed
stables, Kannan argues they'll increasingly exit not to USDC or USDT,
but to censorship-resistant assets like ETH and BTC.

 WHY EVERYDAY TRANSACTIONS, NOT WALL STREET, WILL DRIVE CRYPTO
ADOPTION (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The future of stablecoin adoption lies not in billion-dollar bank
integrations, but in enabling small, everyday payments, like tipping a
gamer, paying freelancers, or remitting $20 to family. These use
cases, often uneconomical for traditional finance, are already gaining
traction on low-fee chains like Polygon. To truly scale, the crypto
industry must stop chasing institutional validation and build for the
billions who need fast, cheap, global payments today. 

 POLYGON ACTIVIST PUSHES FOR POL BUYBACKS AND ZERO INFLATION (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 A Polygon activist investor is spearheading a campaign to overhaul
Polygon's POL tokenomics, citing a 46% price drop and underperformance
relative to ETH and other L2 tokens. Their proposal calls for
eliminating POL's 2% annual inflation and introducing buybacks or
burns to counter sell pressure and restore investor confidence. The
post has gained traction on social media and prompted responses from
Polygon leadership as community debate intensifies around validator
funding and supply strategy.

 THE REAL STABLECOIN CHALLENGE IS INTEROP NOT ISSUANCE (2 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 While the GENIUS Act cements stablecoins as narrow-bank instruments
backed by Treasuries, it bars issuers from paying yield to users,
creating strong incentives for platforms to issue their own coins and
capture the yield themselves. 

 L1 VALUATIONS ARE ABOUT FLOWS AND NARRATIVES, NOT FORMULAS (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Layer-1 valuations are driven less by intrinsic models and more by
perception, momentum, and market positioning. 

 NEOBANKING MAY BE CRYPTO'S KILLER APP? (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 By combining low-friction KYC, instant global payments, 24/7 markets,
DeFi access, yield on idle funds, and self-custody into a unified
'super app', neobanks may become the default financial interface for
the crypto-native economy.
