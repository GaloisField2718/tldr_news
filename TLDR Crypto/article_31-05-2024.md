 BIDEN CAMPAIGN RAMPS UP CRYPTO INDUSTRY OUTREACH IN SURPRISING TONE
'SHIFT' (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 President Biden's re-election campaign has been reaching out to
cryptocurrency industry leaders, seeking advice on crypto community
and crypto policy. Biden has previously said he would veto the repeal
of SAB 121, an SEC ruling making crypto asset custody complex for
institutions to offer. This change in tone comes after the Trump
campaign's pro-crypto rhetoric, which includes accepting crypto
donations, protecting the right to self-custody, and anti-CBDC
remarks.

 ARWEAVE, AO, AND AI (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Arweave has typically depended on external applications to bring data
into its network. However, the launch of AO, a new network built on
Arweave, means Arweave will have the ability to generate consistent

platform. AO separates consensus mechanisms from app computation,
introducing a modular architecture that improves scalability and
security customization, while also creating a marketplace where apps
can acquire computational resources on-demand.

 THOUGHTS ON CELEBRITY MEMECOINS - EXTRACTION IS NOT ADOPTION (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The recent trend of celebrities launching memecoins has reignited
debates over their impact on the cryptocurrency space, with a
historical pattern suggesting such ventures often result in quick
failures and are generally seen as cash grabs rather than genuine
contributions. Critics argue that celebrities should demonstrate
genuine interest and involvement in the crypto community before
promoting their own coins, emphasizing that authentic engagement and
risk-taking, as opposed to opportunistic, profit-driven launches that
exploit the space, are crucial for positive adoption.
