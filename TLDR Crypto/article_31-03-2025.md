SIGN-OFF (2 MINUTE READ) [5]

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING DREAMNET, POWERED BY $DOOD (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Doodle's DreamNet envisions a decentralized story universe that aims
to counter the centralizing forces of AI-generated media with
decentralized, tokenized storytelling that harnesses
community-generated content through Universe Tokens, Idea Tokens, and
Character Tokens. It uses a dynamic Vector Worldstate to create
coherent, evolving narratives that fuel immersive, multi-platform
experiences. The approach promises to shift creative control and value
accrual from centralized entities to diverse communities, empowering
small IPs to compete at scale. 

 STARGATE LAUNCHES ON HYPERCORE/HYPERLIQUID (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Stargate has officially launched on HyperCore, letting users move ETH
from any Stargate-connected chain to HyperCore, where it's converted
to tradable uETH on Hyperliquid. Note that transfers are currently
one-way, with outbound support coming next week. A minimum transfer of
0.05 ETH applies.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STABLECOINS AND THE PARALLELS WITH MONEY MARKET FUNDS (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The rise of stablecoins today closely mirrors the emergence of money
market funds in the 1970s, which revolutionized cash management by
offering a more efficient alternative to traditional banking. As US
lawmakers debate stablecoin regulation, many of the concerns such as
systemic risk, regulatory gaps, and monetary policy impact echo the
criticisms faced by money market funds decades ago. 

 WHY STABLECOINS WILL CHANGE THE WORLD (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stablecoins offer a reliable alternative to traditional banking and
volatile cryptocurrencies, allowing for stable everyday transactions
and wealth protection. They provide a crucial hedge for individuals
facing unreliable banking infrastructure and unpredictable currencies,
complementing Bitcoin's role as a store of value. Improvements like
near-zero transaction fees and enhanced privacy promise to further
streamline payments and expand global adoption, thereby reinforcing
the global economic influence of the US dollar.

MISCELLANEOUS

 POLYMARKET'S $7M “HOME ALONE ATTACK” (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A $7m prediction market on Polymarket was manipulated in an attack
during a UMA oracle dispute. Attackers exploited unmonitored periods
and timed their moves with UMA's voting deadlines to falsely claim
that a mineral deal between the US and Ukraine had been agreed upon
since February. The tactic resulted in an unwarranted market
resolution that netted around $200k for the conspirators and triggered
cascading issues across related markets. 

 GRASS MAKES MID 8 FIGURES (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 GRASS, a data-scraping protocol that stores over 1.6 petabytes of
data daily for AI customers, is generating mid-eight-figure revenue.
It isn't reliant on speculative crypto demand. The protocol's
real-world product, which provides in-demand data, makes it an outlier
unaffected by the broader crypto market downturn.
