 WYOMING IS PUSHING CRYPTO PAYMENTS AND TRYING TO BEAT THE FED TO A
DIGITAL DOLLAR (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Wyoming plans to launch the Wyoming stable token, a US-dollar-backed
stablecoin, in Q1 2025. Its goal is to facilitate faster and cheaper
transactions while introducing a new revenue stream for the state. The
token will serve as a model for a federally digitized dollar, and the
state will invest reserves into Treasury Bills to fund public schools.
If successful, Wyoming hopes to expand to tokenizing other assets like
commodities and real estate.

 ETHEREUM IS DYING WHILE L2'S DANCE ON ITS GRAVE (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ethereum's reliance on Layer 2 (L2) solutions is leading to its
downfall by fragmenting the ecosystem, pushing users towards
centralized L2s, and undermining the original promise of
decentralization. L2s are siphoning off Ethereum's fees and users,
making it impossible for Ethereum to scale effectively at Layer 1,
which could ultimately lead to Ethereum's demise while benefiting L2s
and their backers. 

 MAGIC EDEN'S MAGIC TICKETS CONTROVERSY (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 In early 2022, NFT marketplace Magic Eden (ME) airdropped Magic
Tickets to users, promising airdrops, points, and whitelist sports. It
also introduced the Magic DAO, but it was never implemented, and
mentions of the Magic Tickets have slowly been removed from ME's
blogposts. When ME's diamonds were introduced as part of its points
program, there was a one-time exchange for users - there is now no
planned utility for tickets. Users are frustrated with the small
conversion value and fees that the marketplace generated from
speculative ticket trading.
