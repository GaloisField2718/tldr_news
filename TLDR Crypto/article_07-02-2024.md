 METAMASK DEAL WITH ROBINHOOD BROADENS CRYPTO ACCESS (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 MetaMask and Robinhood are rolling out a new integration that more
closely ties the two services together to create a more seamless
on-ramp and off-ramp user experience. This feature set allows MetaMask
users to purchase crypto directly within the wallet utilizing
Robinhood‚Äôs order flow. On Robinhood, it allows users to fund their
accounts via balances in their MetaMask wallets and withdraw directly
to those wallets as well. 

 SOLANA BLOCKCHAIN IS LIVE AFTER 5-HOUR OUTAGE (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Solana experienced a five-hour outage early yesterday, the fifth
longest in the network's history and its eleventh in two years.
Solana's engineering team released new validator software with a patch
to resolve the issue. The problem was fixed once the validators
upgraded their software to this updated version. Solana‚Äôs price held
up surprisingly well despite the disruption, ending basically flat on
the day.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 CITREA: BITCOIN‚ÄôS FIRST ZK ROLLUP (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Citrea announced a zero knowledge Bitcoin rollup that scales Bitcoin
entirely through the use of zk proofs for on-chain verifiability
within the network. It aims to upgrade Bitcoin without compromising
its security or rewiring its consensus rules. Unlike sidechains,
Citrea focuses on effectively utilizing Bitcoin blockspace,
considering the constantly increasing demand for it. Citrea is yet
another step towards scaling Bitcoin, which has come into focus as of
late with the success of innovative Bitcoin tech like Ordinals. 

 BOOST: A DISTRIBUTED INCENTIVES NETWORK (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The RabbitHole and Quest brands are merging to form a new platform,
Boost, a distributed incentives network. The rebranded entity is
focused on effectively distributing token incentives as a growth
mechanism for protocols. Boost plans to function as the incentive
layer across all chains, with the ability to track any on-chain
transaction for their incentive systems. Beyond just the rebranding,
Boost will also be launching its own L2 to be the decentralized hub
for the network.

 ERC404: EVERYTHING WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT PANDORA (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Pandora, a newly launched crypto token leveraging the new ERC404
standard, is causing a stir in the space. This blog breaks down what
an ERC404 token is and why it‚Äôs interesting. Contrasting with
traditional ERC20 (fungible tokens) and ERC721 (NFTs) standards,
ERC404 establishes a hybrid between both types. 1 PANDORA consists of
both a fungible token and an NFT giving optionality to the owner that
includes fractionalization. It also unlocks some unique mechanics that
were not possible with either traditional token standard before.

Cosmos ecosystem, airdrop farmers are excited about the opportunity to
farm for future Cosmos ecosystem airdrops via DYM staking. This guide
walks through how to easily and securely stake your DYM so you can

 SPECULATION: THE UNSEEN COMPUTER (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article tackles the topic of speculation in crypto and how it
differs from pure gambling. Speculation functions as a method for
handling uncertainties due to incomplete data, thus driving both human
progress and markets, whereas gambling mimics speculation, which can
be seen as detrimental when used on a large enough scale. The piece
encourages the development of economies within our current
infrastructure rather than incentivizing zero-sum gambling. 

 U.S. SEC CLEARS 'DEALER' RULE EXPANSION THAT COULD ROPE IN DEFI (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The SEC has expanded the definition of a 'dealer' in an attempt to
bring more financial operations, including those dealing in crypto
securities, under its jurisdiction. This 'dealer' rule could have
significant implications for the digital assets industry, particularly
DeFi. Unless exempted, those trading in a manner consistent with de
facto market-making must register as dealers. The rule, opposed by
some SEC Commissioners, officially goes into full effect in April
2025.
