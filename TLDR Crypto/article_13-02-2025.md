 deBridge's 0-TVL cross-chain infrastructure uses intents to

 The MegaETH contract is generally efficient, using custom errors,

minting. However it has several inefficiencies, like inefficient ETH
transfers and redundant storage updates. While the contract works,
this post argues that a 10K ETH raise should use Solady, to follow
better gas-saving practices, among other reasons.
