MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SENATE AG COMMITTEE'S CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE BILL ETHICS AMENDMENT
(3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Ahead of next week's Senate Agriculture Committee markup, Democrats
filed amendments to the market structure bill including a proposed
“Digital Asset Ethics Act” that would bar senior officials
(president/VP/lawmakers) from certain digital-asset transactions, plus
a proposal to delay the bill's effectiveness until the CFTC has at
least four commissioners. The bill's path still depends on bipartisan
support (60 votes), and Senate momentum has been complicated by
parallel Banking Committee frictions after Coinbase pulled support
over issues like tokenized equities, DeFi treatment, SEC/CFTC roles,
and stablecoin rewards. 

 BLACKROCK PREDICTS ETHEREUM TO LEAD RWA TOKENIZATION (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 BlackRock is positioning Ethereum as the primary beneficiary of
real-world asset tokenization growth, with the network currently
hosting 66% of all tokenized assets compared to distant competitors
like BNB Chain (10%) and Solana (5%). JPMorgan launched its first
tokenized money market fund on Ethereum, Morgan Stanley filed for an
Ethereum ETF, and BlackRock's own iShares Ethereum Trust holds $11
billion in assets. This institutional validation comes despite ETH
trading 40% below its August all-time high, suggesting TradFi players
are prioritizing Ethereum's infrastructure advantages for regulated
tokenization products.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHEREUM MAKES POST-QUANTUM SECURITY A TOP PRIORITY (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has formed a dedicated post-quantum
security team, led by cryptographic engineer Thomas Coratger,
elevating quantum resistance to a core strategic priority as timelines
accelerate. To fund the effort, EF announced a $1 million Poseidon
Prize to harden a critical ZK hash function, adding to a separate $1
million Proximity Prize for broader post-quantum cryptographic
research. The move follows growing industry concern around quantum
threats, with active post-quantum devnets already running and Ethereum
positioning itself for a smoother migration than Bitcoin due to its
account abstraction roadmap. 

 EULER 2026: THE CREDIT LAYER OF THE INTERNET (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Euler scaled to over $4 billion in deposits across multiple
ecosystems in 2025, launching products like EulerSwap and EulerEarn,
but identified UX gaps around risk transparency and curator
accountability. The 2026 roadmap pivots toward institutional adoption
with ERC-4626-compatible lending markets featuring predictable rates,
RWA tokenization with built-in compliance frameworks, and
partner-focused infrastructure including APIs and white-label
solutions. Euler aims to be the foundational "credit layer of the
internet," bridging DeFi-native participants and traditional financial
institutions through programmable, permissionless lending
infrastructure.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 EVERYONE HATES CRYPTO NOW (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The last two years of intensifying public hostility toward the crypto
sector stemmed from self-inflicted reputational damage across
successive hype cycles – 2017's ICO boom, 2020's DeFi/NFT wave
punctuated by LUNA and Celsius collapses, and 2023-24's memecoin
speculation. There is a generational shift where younger demographics
are increasingly rejecting crypto's speculation-focused culture in
favor of physical experiences and tangible collectibles. The
industry's persistent prioritization of short-term speculation over
utility-building has systematically alienated potential users. 

 OUR VISION FOR FARCASTER (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Neynar is acquiring control of the Farcaster protocol, clients, and
Clanker operations from Merkle. Clanker's team, including founder Jack
Dishman, will join Neynar after Merkle's 5+ year development period.
The company's strategy centers on enabling builders to achieve
recurring revenue through Farcaster's "scenius" community that has
driven key innovations like Frames, Degen, and Warplets, while
maintaining composability across applications with integrated crypto
rails for global transactions and asset issuance. Neynar pledges no
immediate changes to existing products and commits to preserving the
network's open architecture so builders retain ownership of its
distribution channels.

 HOW AI JUDGES CAN SCALE PREDICTION MARKETS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Prediction markets struggle with biased human resolution, evidenced
by disputed Venezuela and Ukraine contracts. Committing specific LLM
versions and prompts to the blockchain ensures manipulation resistance
and credible neutrality. This automated approach solves scaling
bottlenecks, providing transparent, predictable outcomes for markets
exceeding 200 million dollars in volume. 

 STABLECOINS: THE B2B OPPORTUNITY (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 B2B stablecoin rails bypass $25 trillion in inefficient correspondent
banking, slashing 3-4% cross-border friction. While consumer rewards
stall retail adoption, USDC settlement via Bridge and BVNK boosts
mid-market EBITDA by 13-19%. July 2025's GENIUS Act provides the legal
clarity necessary for this massive treasury transformation.
