 MEME COIN MANIA HELPS PUSH SOLANA DEFI VOLUME OVER ETHEREUM FOR FIRST
TIME (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Solana DEX volumes surpassed Ethereum‚Äôs for the first time over the
past week due in large part to meme coin activity and strong inflows
of capital into the ecosystem. This stat highlights the theme that has
gained traction this year of Solana being a legitimate contender with
the Ethereum ecosystem, aided by lower gas fees and faster transaction
speeds. Despite this growth, Ethereum‚Äôs market cap is still over 6
times larger than Solana‚Äôs.

 RESTAKED ROLLUPS ON ALTLAYER SUPPORTED BY EIGENLAYER (11 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 AltLayer and EigenLayer have proposed a new rollup design called
Restaked Rollups to address decentralization, security, and
interoperability issues in app-specific rollups. This includes three
modular components for decentralized verification, faster commit
finality, and decentralized sequencing. These enhancements are set to
facilitate the secure, efficient functioning of app-specific rollups
while addressing challenges posed by centralized sequencing, slow
finality, and verification. 

 GHOST ADDRESSES (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ghost Addresses are an advancement on the Lightning Network that lets
users run their own lightning node without needing a custodial third
party or a publicly accessible server to have a wallet address. They
enhance user experience and remove the need for trusted
intermediaries, combining the clever behavior of Phantom Payments with
the convenience of a Lightning Address. This novel innovation offers a
simpler way for users to receive transactions directly in their own
custody.

an upcoming DEX, Bunni v2, uses these features to offer shapeshifting
liquidity, optimized fee income, and impermanent loss control.

 CRYPTO SCAMMERS ABUSE TWITTER ‚ÄòFEATURE‚Äô TO IMPERSONATE
HIGH-PROFILE ACCOUNTS (3 MINUTE READ) [12]

any account name to be associated with a tweet's ID. This potentially
leads users to fraudulent accounts instead of the proposed legitimate

to promote fake crypto giveaways, wallet-draining websites, and
deceitful Discord channels.
