MARKETS & BUSINESS

 STRIPE'S ACQUISITION OF BRIDGE IS A STROKE OF GENIUS (5 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Stripe's acquisition of Bridge allows it to tap into the $120
trillion B2B payment market, leveraging stablecoin infrastructure to
bypass traditional banking fees and delays. By integrating Bridge's
technology, Stripe can reduce transaction costs, enhance speed, and
expand its payment offerings â€” potentially challenging banks'
dominance in large-scale business transactions.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING BASED AGENT: CREATE AI AGENTS WITH FULL ONCHAIN
FUNCTIONALITY IN LESS THAN 3 MINUTES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Coinbase's Developer Platform (CDP) has announced the Based Agent: a
framework to create autonomous onchain agents with full access to any
onchain interaction. With OpenAI's GPT-4o model, users can have a
fully functional agent that can work in chat or autonomous mode in
less than three minutes. Users can easily add any functionality to the
Python-based bot, including posting its thoughts on Twitter. 

 LRT2 FIXES EVERYTHING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LRT2 is a tokenized staking emissions product. When AVS' go live,
restakers will receive tokens in various cryptos, typically in small
amounts. LRT2 wraps all these tokens into a single token, facilitating
greater value alignment and easier access for holders. With all
underlying assets staked, the token will become interest-bearing.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 POSSIBLE FUTURES OF THE ETHEREUM PROTOCOL, PART 4: THE VERGE (28
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethereum's Verge portion of the roadmap aims to drastically reduce
node operation requirements, enabling full verification on lightweight
devices like mobile phones and smartwatches. It accomplishes this
optimization through stateless verification and validity proofs. Key
decisions remain, like how to consider quantum resistance versus
performance. In this post, Vitalik Buterins outlines plans for
implementing validity proofs for EVM execution and consensus and
making a much more cryptographically robust protocol. 

 A PERSPECTIVE ON LEGAL SETUPS FOR CRYPTO COMPANIES (8 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Web3 foundations were set up to handle token issuance offshore to
legally and financially separate token operations from the development
company to minimize founder liability and avoid regulatory constraints
in places like the U.S. or Singapore. Two main structures exist â€”
the Panama Private Interest Foundation and Cayman Foundation Company
â€” each designed to obscure or eliminate the founders as ultimate
beneficial owners (UBOs), thus preventing direct tax and legal
implications. However, this requires careful setup to avoid pitfalls,
with independent governance often achievable only in the costlier
Cayman model.

 MEET ZACHXBT, THE MASKED VIGILANTE TRACKING DOWN BILLIONS IN CRYPTO
SCAMS AND THEFTS (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ZachXBT is an anonymous crypto investigator who traced a massive $243
million Bitcoin theft from a single victim, leading to the arrests of
two suspects. Known for his relentless blockchain sleuthing, ZachXBT
has disrupted countless crypto scams, often racing against traditional
law enforcement and aiding in criminal investigations, all while
staying anonymous to avoid retaliation. 

 CBDCS AND CRYPTO SHOULD COEXIST, NOT COMPETE â€” COINDCX CO-FOUNDER
(3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX, advocates for the coexistence of
CBDCs and cryptocurrencies in India, suggesting they serve
complementary roles: CBDCs provide centralized financial control and
policy implementation, while cryptocurrencies support self-sovereignty
and decentralized finance. Gupta says that balanced regulation and tax
relief are crucial to foster India's Web3 innovation and that CBDCs
will not undermine personal financial autonomy.
