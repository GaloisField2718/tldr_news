 THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF FIT21'S CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE BILL
(5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Though FIT21 is a momentous step forward for legitimizing the crypto
industry, issues with its current form must be addressed in Senate
negotiations. The bill's bifurcation of cryptocurrencies into
‚Äúrestricted digital assets‚Äù and ‚Äúdigital commodities‚Äù ignores
tokens' global and fungible nature, leading to fragmentation and
regulatory arbitrage. Lawmakers should refine the bill to unify spot
markets for tokens that are not otherwise securities.

 FANTOM FOUNDATION CREATES SONIC FOUNDATION LABS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Fantom has announced it will create the Sonic Foundation and Sonic
Labs to support "Sonic", a new blockchain that will connect to the
Ethereum ecosystem via a layer-2 bridge. The Fantom Foundation has
successfully raised $10 million to bolster Sonic's ecosystem growth.
It expects Fantom users to completely migrate from the Fantom chain to
the Sonic chain (due to higher security and speed). 

 ETHERFI UNVEILS PLANS FOR CREDIT CARD TIED TO RESTAKING HOLDINGS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Leading restaking protocol EtherFi has announced EtherFi Cash, a new
credit card associated with an onchain account. Users can pay using
USDC holdings or borrowing USDC against their EtherFi portfolio. Any
interest accrued can be paid off using eETH staking rewards. Card
pre-orders will be available in July and shipped in September. 

 ETHEREUM'S NEXT UPGRADE: PECTRA (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethereum's next hard fork, Pectra, consists of updates to the Prague
execution layer and Electra consensus layer. It will be released in Q1
2025 and feature PeerDAS data availability sampling to improve rollup
scaling and upgrades to the EVM Object Format (EOF) to support a
better UX. It should help to alleviate pressure on the networking
layer and support increased blob demand.

 USE CASES FOR ZK (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Thus far, ZK is used for efficient signature verification, storage
proofs, proving transactions, and bridging ‚Äì all parts of the modern
modular stack. Going forward, ZK could solve open problems around
avoiding redundant compute and preserving privacy. 

 ARGUMENTS AGAINST FIT21 (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act
(FIT21) fails to adequately protect DeFi developers and DAOs from the
CFTC's expansive authority, despite appearing to offer exemptions for
"decentralized governance systems." The act contains numerous
contradictions and ambiguities, particularly around its definitions
and the registration requirements for commodity pool operators and
decentralized systems, leading to concerns that it will not resolve
the ongoing regulatory uncertainty in the crypto sector.

 USING TORI FOR HIGH APYS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Aave's high APY of over 17% for lending USDC is driven by strong
demand to borrow USDC. Using Aave requires depositing collateral (like
ETH), borrowing against it, and paying interest, which is distributed
to lenders. Aave is managed by blockchain smart contracts for
transparency and reduced risk. 

 DEVELOP A TOKEN WITH LONG-TERM HOLDING VALUE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Traction is crucial for startups to succeed and retain investor
interest. Founders who strictly focus on initial liquidity without
building longer-term value will see their token's price plummet
because market dynamics will favor established leaders. Efficient
markets quickly reprice assets based on real value, and crypto
regulatory pressures will require exchanges to push for more rigorous
metrics before listing tokens. This paradigm shift emphasizes the
importance of genuine user engagement and practical utility in the
crypto sector.
