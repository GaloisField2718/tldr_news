 Crypto exchange OKX is rolling out inscription support across several

Doginals (DRC-20). In conjunction with this announcement, OKX also
announced plans to unveil a marketplace for these assets after the

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ORDERBLOCKS EXPLAINED (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread discusses the mechanics of Orderblocks and liquidity gaps
in trading while dispelling myths around market manipulation. Markets
react at these points due to order-splitting, where large traders
leave resting orders at high volume spots which then act as
support/resistance. These trends occur across markets and timeframes.
Investors should consider market behavior upon retest for insight into
buyer activities.

fairer, more decentralized internet. Instead of focusing on the

 THE RISE AND FALL OF OPENSEA (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This thread details the rise and fall of OpenSea, once valued at
$13.3 billion. The NFT market has been brutal, especially with the
entrance of a fast-moving competitor, Blur, onto the scene. Blur
focused on features that would attract professional traders, who make
up a majority of the transaction volume in the NFT ecosystem. OpenSea
has raised hundreds of millions in funds and is seeing dwindling
volumes - its future seems to be more questionable now than ever
before.
