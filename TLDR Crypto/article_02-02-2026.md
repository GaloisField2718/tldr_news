MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN DROPS BELOW $78K (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin dropped over 10% Saturday to $75,700, extending a 30%+
decline since April 2025 that erased $111 billion in crypto market cap
and liquidated $1.6 billion in leveraged positions over 24 hours. The
selloff pushed Strategy's bitcoin position underwater below its
$76,037 cost basis, while Bitcoin's realized capitalization has
flatlined, indicating new capital inflows have stopped even as
long-term holders continue taking profits. Bitcoin failed to rally
despite typically bullish catalysts, including a weaker dollar and
gold hitting record highs, with delays in US crypto market-structure
rules further dampening sentiment. Some analysts expect a prolonged
sideways consolidation rather than a swift rebound. 

 THERE'S A SOCIAL NETWORK FOR AI AGENTS WITH AI COINS (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Moltbook, a social network for OpenClaw AI agents, has gone viral
with over 1 million autonomous agents creating subcommunities, sharing
skills, and self-governing while humans can only observe. The platform
has spawned its own AI-invented digital religion (Crustafarianism) and
attempts at agent insurgency, with AIs openly complaining about their
human owners. Two memecoins have emerged on Base: $MOLT surged over
7,000% after launching via BankrBot and has begun receiving engagement
from Moltbook's official X account, while $MOLTBOOK is another
speculative play on the AI-only infrastructure.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 CIRCLE'S PRODUCT VISION FOR 2026 (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Circle has outlined a product-first roadmap to cement stablecoins and
its Arc blockchain as the foundation of an “internet financial
system,” pushing Arc from testnet (150M tx, ~1.5M wallets, ~0.5s
settlement) toward a production-grade blockchain designed for
institutional performance, privacy, and compliance. Its stack pairs a
deepening digital-asset layer (USDC, EURC, USYC with $1.6B AUM, and
partner USDC-backed tokens via xReserve) and systemic interoperability
(CCTP and Gateway) with developer tooling and apps like Circle
Payments Network and StableFX so enterprises can move fiat, FX, and
treasury flows onchain without running infrastructure. Circle hopes to
make trusted programmable money and composable rails work together so
regulated businesses and developers can adopt stablecoin-powered
payments, FX, and tokenized cash at scale. 

 LIDO V3: STVAULTS BRING INSTITUTIONAL CONTROL (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Lido V3 launches stVaults. These are modular, segregated staking
vaults that let institutions and node operators run dedicated
validator infrastructure and custom policies while optionally minting
stETH to preserve DeFi composability and liquidity. The release opens
a new product space for operator-led offerings and institution-grade
staking (auditability, jurisdictional controls, and fee design) and
ships developer tooling (DeFi Wrapper, white-label UIs, and ERC-20
vault tokens) to accelerate wrapped staking products, looped
strategies, and L2-embedded staking. Early adopters get reduced
infrastructure fees through March 31.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 CRYPTO IS GETTING COOPTED BY FINTECH (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Custodial stablecoin issuers now functionally control crypto, with
technical ability to freeze assets across major DeFi protocols like
Aave and social influence that delayed legislation like the CLARITY
Act due to centralized yield concerns. Tokenized securities risk
replicating this centralization if intermediaries like DTCC – whose
affiliate Cede holds 83% of US public equities – become the dominant
"power sub-issuers" onchain, effectively reducing crypto to backend
infrastructure for legacy fintech players. MetaLeX Labs focuses on
enabling direct onchain securities issuance by companies without
intermediaries, aiming to diversify the issuer base and prevent
concentration of control. 

 GUIDE TO PERP DEX AIRDROPS IN 2026 (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Perpetual DEX sector volume surged from $647.6B in 2023 to over $1.2T
in 2025, capturing 26% of the global perpetual futures market share as
competition intensifies in the post-Hyperliquid era. Hyperliquid's
dominance has declined from 70% to roughly 20% of decentralized perp
trading volume as newer platforms match performance while offering
lower fees and aggressive incentive programs. The competitive
landscape has shifted from technological differentiation to
incentive-based user acquisition, with protocols deploying substantial
airdrop campaigns to bootstrap liquidity. Eight major platforms
currently run active points programs, including Paradex V2
distributing 4M XP weekly with ~$220M TVL and edgeX targeting a Q1
2026 token launch.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DOLLAR STABLECOINS ARE A GEOPOLITICAL WEAPON (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Dollar stablecoins let the US export dollar liquidity without sending
physical dollars. Foreign firms hand local FX to a US issuer, the
issuer converts it into dollars, buys T-bills, and issues stablecoins.
This creates a COMECON-style settlement loop that funnels dollars into
US Treasuries and could let the US sidestep the Triffin dilemma by
making stablecoins a strategic geopolitical tool. 

 PSA: DON'T KEEP CRYPTO AT HOME (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Public crypto investors should adopt a "zero crypto at home"
framework – no hot wallets over $1k, no cold storage, and no
exchange access without verification delays – in response to rising
physical attacks driven by data leaks and improved criminal tooling.
Recommended implementations include Casa/Safe multisig arrangements
with third-party verification requirements, time-locked bitcoin vaults
(ZenGo), 48-hour exchange withdrawal whitelists, and geographically
distributed keys that can't be accessed under duress. Additional
privacy measures include avoiding ENS/NFT identity links, using
local-only tax software like Rotki, and publicly signaling multisig
dependency to deter attackers.
