 CRYPTO.COM FORCES THROUGH CONTROVERSIAL VOTE TO RE-MINT 70 BILLION
CRO (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Crypto.com controversially approved a vote to re-mint $70 billion
worth of CRO tokens, with its validators (who hold a majority of CRO)
playing a decisive role in swaying the vote. This move has sparked
debate over concerns about token dilution and the implications of
concentrated validator influence on governance. 

 BURWICK LAW FILES A CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT OVER $LIBRA (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Burwick Law has filed a class action lawsuit in the New York Supreme
Court alleging that Kelsier, KIP, Meteora, and others manipulated the
launch of the $LIBRA token to mislead investors. The complaint claims
insiders artificially inflated prices, withheld 85% of the supply, and
later withdrew funds, causing a market collapse that harmed retail
buyers.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 THE STATE OF STABLECOINS 2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stablecoins now total over $214B in supply, processing $35 trillion
in annual volume and attracting both DeFi and institutional adoption.
Major stablecoin players like USDC, USDT, and newer entrants such as
USDe and USDS are expanding across multiple blockchains, demonstrating
that stablecoins provide a reliable bridge for onchain finance,
cross-border payments, and real-world assets. 

 BINANCE LAUNCHES BINANCE ALPHA (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Binance Alpha 2.0 integrates on-chain token purchasing directly
within the Binance Exchange, connecting centralized (CEX) and
decentralized (DEX) trading. This upgrade removes bridging and
wallet-connection hassles, letting users seamlessly buy and manage
tokens through Binance's interface and existing accounts.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STATE OF ARBITRUM ECOSYSTEM (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Driven by strong DEX volumes and perp DEX activity, Arbitrum has
achieved a self-sustaining DeFi ecosystem with a $2.5B TVL, 1.7M+
weekly active users, 1.9M average daily transactions, and 782
protocols since 2022. Key sectors show significant growth, including
Aave's lending market surging 370% to $742M TVL in 2024, stablecoin
adoption rising, and real-world asset TVL reaching $150M, supported by
the DAO's STEP initiative amid global regulatory clarity. 

 CRYPTO PROJECT DUE DILIGENCE (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Before making an investment decision, it's important to evaluate a
project's sentiment, risk/reward profile, uniqueness, time horizon,
tokenomics, team quality, organic volume, and price action. This may
help identify more compelling opportunities as investors weigh factors
like potential downside, real-world utility, development team
commitment, and organic trading behavior to avoid overhyped or risky
plays.

 YOU ARE THE EXIT LIQUIDITY (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Crypto has transformed into an AI-driven casino that uses automation,
influencer hype, and psychological manipulation to extract liquidity
from retail investors so the house always wins. Meme coins, political
tokens, and rebranded Ponzi schemes thrive, not because of innovation,
but because attention, tribalism, and algorithmic deception have
replaced fundamentals. 

 WHAT HAPPENED WITH SIMD-228? (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Solana's governance proposal SIMD-228, which aimed to reduce
inflation by shifting to a dynamic model based on staking
participation, failed to pass with 61.39% voting yes, below the
required 66.67%, despite a record 74.29% stake participation from
70.13% of validators. The proposal's rejection keeps Solana's
inflation rate at 4.7%, decreasing 15% annually, but the high
engagementâ€”surpassing Cosmos Hub (59.67%) and U.S. 2020 voter
turnout (66.8%)â€”insinuates a maturing, engaged proof-of-stake
community focused on the network's economic future.
