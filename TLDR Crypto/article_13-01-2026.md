 UK COMMITTEE CHAIRS PUSH FOR CRYPTO POLITICAL DONATIONS BAN (4 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Seven Labour MPs chairing parliamentary committees are pushing the UK
government to ban cryptocurrency political donations in the
forthcoming Elections Bill, citing concerns that crypto enables
foreign interference and creates verification challenges for electoral
integrity. The push intensified after the Electoral Commission
revealed Reform UK accepted a £9 million crypto donation from
Christopher Harborne, a Thailand-based investor holding approximately
12% of Tether. Despite the pressure, government sources indicate the
ban won't be included due to implementation complexity, even as the UK
advances its broader crypto regulatory framework with plans to
regulate digital assets by 2027. 

 CFTC LAUNCHES INNOVATION COMMITTEE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 New CFTC Chair Michael Selig unveiled an Innovation Advisory
Committee, expanding the agency's focus on crypto, AI, and prediction
markets as Congress debates legislation to broaden CFTC authority over
digital assets. The committee will include industry leaders from firms
like Polymarket, Kalshi, Gemini, and Nasdaq, signaling a more
proactive regulatory posture as the agency weighs market structure
rules and rising concerns around insider trading in prediction
markets.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 X INTRODUCES CRYPTO-AWARE SMART CASHTAGS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 X's Smart Cashtags is an asset-aware tagging system that allows users
to tag specific cryptocurrencies and smart contracts while displaying
near real-time onchain prices directly on timelines. The feature
addresses ticker confusion by distinguishing between similarly named
tokens and will provide an API with almost real-time data for any
onchain asset. Screenshots suggest a potential buy/sell trading
integration through partnerships with platforms like Coinbase and
Base. X plans to collect feedback during testing before a wider
rollout in February. 

 POLYGON'S VISION FOR THE OPEN MONEY STACK (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Polygon Labs' “Open Money Stack” is a comprehensive
infrastructure framework designed to move all global money onchain
through integrated services, including blockchain rails, orchestration
layers, wallet infrastructure, compliance tools, stablecoin
interoperability, and onchain yield mechanisms. The platform aims to
solve inefficiencies in cross-border payments by enabling instant
settlement without correspondent banks, leveraging Polygon's track
record of facilitating over $2 trillion in onchain value transfers
across six years. Polygon's Agglayer will provide cross-chain
interoperability to make different blockchain networks invisible to
end users. Category-defining companies in the global money movement
space will be established within the next three years.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW DOES A NETWORK ENABLE DAPPS WITH LOWER GAS FEES? (SPONSOR) [8] 

 The Midnight network [8] separates the governance and capital from
operational costs using a dual-component model. NIGHT is the native
governance token that generates DUST - a shielded resource which
powers transactions. DApp operators get PREDICTABLE OPERATIONAL COSTS
and can OFFSET FEES for their users by holding enough NIGHT. Learn
more about NIGHT [8] 

 WHERE DEFI GOES FROM HERE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DeFi TVL reached a new all-time high of $225 billion in October, but
this represented only 10% growth from the 2021 peak of $204 billion,
suggesting the crypto-native user base may be largely tapped out. The
scale gap remains massive: current DeFi TVL sits around $164 billion,
while mobile fintech and neobanks collectively manage over $4 trillion
in assets. Bright spots include the stablecoin market exceeding $260
billion (surpassing DeFi TVL) and yield-bearing stablecoins crossing
$20 billion, indicating growing demand for onchain yield products.
Future growth will come from embedded DeFi integrations with
traditional fintechs and simple, reliable products rather than
increasingly complex financial instruments. 

 ETHEREUM MUST PASS THE WALKAWAY TEST (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum itself must be walkaway-safe (work without consistent EVM
updates). This requires full quantum resistance, ZK-EVM and PeerDAS
scalability, a decades-lasting state model, full account abstraction,
a DoS-resistant gas schedule, a durable PoS economic model, and a
block-building design that guarantees long-term censorship resistance.

 THE ONLY AIRDROP THAT MATTERS THIS YEAR (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Despite most current airdrops offering minimal value due to
oversaturated concepts and insufficient liquidity, prediction market
platforms Kalshi and Polymarket represent a potentially significant
opportunity, having each raised hundreds of millions at $10B+
valuations with mainstream adoption from figures like Elon Musk and JD
Vance. Both platforms may reward users through either token airdrops
or IPO share allocations based on trading activity, with the
opportunity being compared to Solana's airdrop season and Hyperliquid
in scale. The farming strategy centers on generating high trading
volume in liquid markets, particularly exploiting high-probability
outcomes for consistent returns, though user activity remains
concentrated among the top 1% of participants. The primary risk is
that neither platform may ultimately allocate tokens or shares to
users, making the time investment potentially worthless. 

 JPMORGAN DISMISSES $6.6 TRILLION STABLECOIN RISK (4 MINUTE READ) [12]


 More than 100 community bankers warned US senators that stablecoins
offering yield-like incentives could pull $6.6 trillion in deposits
away from local lending institutions, threatening their lending
capacity. JPMorgan dismissed these concerns, taking a notably calmer
stance than the community banking sector and characterizing the risk
as overstated. The bank reinforced its position by continuing to serve
stablecoin issuers, signaling confidence that the sector poses
manageable rather than systemic competitive risk to traditional
banking.
