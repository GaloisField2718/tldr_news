 EVEN SMALL-TIME JITO AIRDROPPERS ARE GETTING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN
JTO TOKENS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Jito, described by some as Flashbots + Lido on Solana, conducted an
airdrop yesterday that took all of Crypto Twitter by storm. Close to
10,000 Solana addresses were airdropped a minimum of 4,941 JTO tokens,
which ended up being worth nearly $15,000 by the end of the day
yesterday. This airdrop was reminiscent of the Uniswap airdrop that
kickstarted the Ethereum ecosystem last cycle.

MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Robinhood is launching its crypto trading app to all eligible users
across the EU, marking a significant step in its international
expansion. This move took place a week after the firmâ€™s debut in the
UK. Robinhood Crypto will be in compliance with the EU's comprehensive
crypto regulation framework. This expansion marks a change in tone
after Robinhood delisted tokens like Cardano, Polygon, and Solana
earlier in the year.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 MAKING DEFI FRONTENDS GREAT AGAIN THROUGH LAPPS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This thread highlights the idea of lApps or local apps. lApps are
frontends meant to be run privately on individual usersâ€™ local
machines, offering stronger security, quick loading, no forced
updates, and no frontend fees. lApps operate through third-party
software, like browser extensions or desktop applications. The idea is
for users to access DeFi projects on their own devices independent of
external web servers through a simple click on a link. While the exact
implementation is still to be determined, this is an innovative
approach to web3 frontends. 

 WORMHOLE QUERIES LAUNCHES, BRINGING ON-DEMAND ACCESS TO ON-CHAIN DATA
TO APPS ON ANY CHAIN (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Wormhole has launched Wormhole Queries, a service aimed at
simplifying app development through a decentralized system for instant
cross-chain data retrieval. This latest innovation improves upon
Wormhole's traditional "push" attestation model by reducing latency
and data access costs significantly. Its flexible method promises
simplified cross-chain development, rapid requests, cheaper gas fees,
and flexible data retrieval. Expected use cases include DeFi
platforms, gaming, and cross-chain digital identity.

 HOW TO FARM MARGINFI AIRDROP IN 10MIN (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread runs through a step-by-step guide on how to farm
MarginFiâ€™s upcoming airdrop within 10 minutes. The steps include
logging into MarginFi, lending to the SOL module, borrowing USDC,
converting that into SOL, and re-lending the SOL. The procedure can be
repeated to increase the user's liquidation price, but the thread
advises maintaining a health level of 20-30% and waiting for the
airdrop.

 FUTURE OF SOLANA'S HYPED SAGA PHONE IS 'UNDER INTERNAL DISCUSSION' AS
SALES FIGURES FAIL TO WOW (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The future of Solana's Saga Phone remains uncertain due to
underwhelming sales, according to the company's founder Anatoly
Yakovenko. The smartphone, which targets the blockchain industry,
apparently requires a 25-50K user base to incentivize app developers.
Yakovenko mentioned the growth of Progressive Web Apps and pass keys
as significant factors narrowing the distinction between regular and
specialized smartphones, potentially impacting Saga Phone's demand.
