 FHFA DIRECTS FANNIE & FREDDIE TO CONSIDER CRYPTO IN MORTGAGE RISK
ASSESSMENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency has issued a directive
requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider cryptocurrency as a
borrower asset in single-family mortgage risk assessments, marking a
major step in legitimizing crypto within traditional housing finance.
The move enables crypto, if held on regulated U.S. exchanges, to count
toward reserves without needing to convert to USD. Enterprises must
account for volatility and risk-adjust appropriately. 

 REPUBLIC LAUNCHING TOKENIZED PRE-IPO TRADING (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Republic is launching tokenized representations of pre-IPO SpaceX
shares, letting retail investors buy exposure onchain for as little as
$50. It plans to expand to firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, and
more. Tokens will mirror secondary-market prices and bypass the usual
$10,000+ and accredited-investor requirements for private-company
stakes. This move raises legal and disclosure questions about retail
access to private equity. Blockchain promises lower costs, faster
settlement, greater transparency, and broader accessibility for
investors.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SOFI TO LAUNCH BLOCKCHAIN REMITTANCES WITH STABLECOINS (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 SoFi will introduce international remittances over blockchain
networks using US dollars and select stablecoins, enabling 24/7
transfers with rapid local‐currency deposits at a lower cost than
traditional wires. The fintech company also plans to relaunch crypto
trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum later this year, with future
offerings like staking, crypto‐collateralized borrowing, and
blockchain infrastructure services via its Galileo platform. CEO
Anthony Noto's strategy follows SoFi's 2023 exit from digital‐asset
services and utilizes new OCC guidance allowing national banks to
provide crypto custody and stablecoin services. 

 ZKSYNC AIRBENDER: THE WORLD'S FASTEST OPEN-SOURCE RISC-V ZKVM (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ZKsync Airbender is an open-source RISC-V zkVM that outperforms
existing proving systems by 4-6x on single GPUs, delivering sub-second
proofs for ZKsync blocks and averaging under 35 seconds to prove
Ethereum blocks on one H100. Benchmarks show Airbender achieves 21.8
MHz base-layer throughput on H100 – 6x faster than SP1 Turbo and 20x
faster than RiscZero – and runs efficiently. By slashing proving
costs to $0.0001 per transfer and enabling near-real-time,
consumer-grade block proving, Airbender promises to drive
decentralized, fast, and low-cost interoperability across chains and
support new use cases like client-side proofs and ZK-native apps.

 HOW CENOA AND BRIDGE EMPOWER ENTREPRENEURS IN EMERGING MARKETS (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Cenoa partnered with Bridge to enable instant virtual USD accounts
for users in markets like Turkey, Nigeria, and Mexico, helping
solopreneurs bypass FX markups, account freezes, and cross-border
friction. The platform now delivers up to 10x lower costs than legacy

and over $5 million in monthly volume. With 30x transaction growth and
expansion to 40+ countries, Cenoa is showcasing stablecoins as a
powerful tool for economic inclusion and global ecommerce
participation. 

 A TRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK VS PHANTONOMICS (19 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Excess VC capital in bull markets creates a “market for lemons,”
fueling low-quality token projects. Phantonomics describes opaque
tokenomics that insiders exploit. Common transparency pitfalls include
hidden revenue flows, equity-token misalignment, foundation billing
abuses, unclear vesting schedules, and privileged market-maker deals.

 COINBASE EXPANDS EXCHANGE-AS-A-SERVICE AMID COMPETITIVE PRESSURE (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Coinbase is doubling down on its Exchange-as-a-Service model,
offering custody, trading, staking, lending, and stablecoin
infrastructure as a turnkey package for banks and brokerages. The
pitch is to skip years of internal buildout and integrate a trusted,
crash-tested crypto stack in weeks. While rivals like Kraken also play
in this space, Coinbase is shifting its focus from fighting for retail
share to powering the backend of the broader financial ecosystem. 

 THE HORSES OF WEB3 MARKETING APOCALYPSE (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Web3 marketing is plagued by copied playbooks, like airdrops, fake
engagement, and irrelevant campaigns, that fail due to misaligned
audiences and lazy execution. Teams should use onchain data to
identify real users, critically assess whether an airdrop will retain
value, and treat DevRel as a core distribution channel rather than
mere support. Genuine creativity, grounded in deep product
understanding and user research, trumps recycled tactics, and building
conviction through small, honest wins will organically grow a
committed community.
