 ETHEREUM ETFS LIKELY TO LAUNCH THIS SUMMER (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Gary Gensler expects spot Ethereum ETFs to be approved and launched
in the U.S. this summer. However, he has not explicitly clarified
whether the SEC considers Ethereum a security or a commodity. 

 COINBASE STATE OF CRYPTO SUMMIT REVIEW (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 80% of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF demand comes from self-directed
investors. The company is excited about every asset's eventual
tokenization. There are still institutions on the sidelines. This is
the first real institutional cycle, with more hedge funds coming next.
Bitcoin is the hardest asset for investors to understand. Crypto has a
branding problem among institutions. Other panelists shared
information on consumer crypto, regulation, and adoption.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 THE GRAPH TRANSITIONS INTO A FULLY DECENTRALIZED DATA LAYER (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The Graph has fully transitioned to a decentralized data layer after
completing its "Sunrise initiative", moving from centralized hosting
to a distributed network of token-incentivized data indexers. The
shift should improve blockchain data organization and accessibility
and allow developers to deploy and manage subgraphs effectively across
multiple chains without relying on centralized services.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 INVESTING AMIDST HIGH VOLATILITY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Investors must embrace volatility and the non-linear nature of
investment trajectories to achieve high returns. It is important to
recognize that the most profitable moments come when people are
panicking about the market and begin to retreat. Taking advantage of
these opportunities requires readiness to invest during downturns
(e.g., having cash on platform) and understanding that markets are
inherently inefficient and not as predictable as many believe. 

 THE STATE OF CRYPTO: THE FORTUNE 500 MOVING ONCHAIN (4 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Fortune 100 companies have increased their onchain projects by 39%
year-over-year. 56% of Fortune 500 companies are developing onchain
initiatives, and 53% of small businesses are likely to look for
crypto-savvy applicants. These metrics emphasize the need for sensible
crypto regulation to promote crypto development and adoption in the
US.

 ZAPPER INTRODUCES ZAPPER PROTOCOL (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Zapper has introduced Zapper Protocol, an open system designed to
enhance on-chain data readability and interaction on Ethereum and
ultimately foster global economic connections and on-chain literacy.
This initiative is a distinct evolution from Zapper's origins as a
DeFi portfolio aggregator to a broader role in making blockchain
ecosystems accessible and understandable through community-driven
contributions to data interpretation. 

 FORCED TXS VS BASED SEQUENCING (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Only the OP Stack and Arbitrum Orbit allow forced transactions to
bypass a centralized sequencer, protecting against sequencer failures.
Based sequencing, which uses an L1 validator set for the L2, allows
the rollup to inherit the L1's liveness and censorship resistance.
However, it is difficult to provide preconfirmations faster than L1
inclusion confirmations.
