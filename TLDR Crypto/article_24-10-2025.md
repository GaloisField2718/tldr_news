MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TRUMP PARDONS BINANCE FOUNDER CZ ZHAO (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 President Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded
guilty in 2023 to violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to
implement effective anti-money laundering controls and willfully
violating US economic sanctions. Zhao's plea was part of a $4.3
billion DOJ settlement with Binance, and he served four months of his
sentence before receiving the pardon. The pardon follows an August
Wall Street Journal report that the Trump family's crypto venture,
which has generated $4.5 billion since the 2024 election, benefits
from a partnership with a trading platform administered by Binance. 

 AAVE LABS ACQUIRES STABLE FINANCE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Aave Labs has acquired Stable Finance, a San Francisco fintech known
for its user-friendly stablecoin savings app. Stable's founder, Mario
Baxter Cabrera, will join Aave as its new Director of Product,
bringing his team and technology to accelerate Aave's consumer product
roadmap. The acquisition complements Aave's growing institutional
platform, Horizon (over $300M in deposits since launch), and supports
its push into stablecoin-based savings tools. Stable's app will be
phased out, with its tech integrated into future Aave products as the
company bridges institutional DeFi infrastructure with intuitive
consumer experiences.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE UNVEILS PAYMENTS MCP FOR AI AGENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Coinbase's Payments MCP enables AI agents and chatbots like Claude
and Gemini to access blockchain wallets and execute crypto
transactions via natural language. It leverages the x402 payment
standard to allow agents to discover and pay for any x402-compatible
service, including web scraping, image generation, or agentic
commerce. The Model Context Protocol tool runs locally with minimal
user input and email sign-in. The release follows Coinbase and
Cloudflare's x402 Foundation initiative to standardize AI payments,
positioning stablecoins as optimal infrastructure for autonomous agent
commerce. 

 CLANKER LAUNCHPAD ACQUIRED BY FARCASTER (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Clanker, the leading Base launchpad behind projects like Bankr and
Noice, is joining Farcaster with plans for deeper platform
integration. The partnership brings significant tokenomics changes:
two-thirds of all protocol fees will now be used to buy and hold
$CLANKER, while the team burned accumulated ecosystem tokens from
v0-v3.1 fee vaults and permanently locked roughly 7% of $CLANKER
supply into a one-sided LP. Despite the integration, $CLANKER remains
independent of the Farcaster protocol, which continues to operate
without its own token.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STATE OF CRYPTO 2025: THE YEAR CRYPTO WENT MAINSTREAM (40 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The crypto market, driven by institutional adoption from BlackRock,
Visa, PayPal, and Stripe, crossed $4 trillion for the first time with
40-70 million active users. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs now hold over
$175 billion (up 169% year-over-year). Stablecoins processed $46
trillion in annual transaction volume, rivaling Visa and exceeding
PayPal's throughput by 5x, with stablecoin issuers now holding over
$150 billion in US Treasuries as the #17 largest holder. Blockchain
infrastructure scaled to 3,400 transactions per second (100x growth in
five years), with transaction costs dropping to under one cent on
Ethereum L2s, while US regulatory clarity arrived through the GENIUS
Act and CLARITY Act, establishing frameworks for stablecoins and
digital asset oversight. 

 WHOEVER OWNS STABLECOIN DEPOSITS OWNS THE FUTURE OF BANKING (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Stablecoins are redefining banking by pulling deposits out of banks
and onto blockchains, making money programmable, portable, and
transparent. Traditional banks built scale through deposits and
fintechs rented them from partner banks, but crypto neobanks like
KAST, Tria, and Plasma now own onchain liquidity directly, earning and
sharing yield on stablecoins instead of collecting fees. In emerging
markets like LATAM, stablecoin adoption has exploded ($319B in Brazil
alone), turning them into the default savings and payment rails. With
over $300B in stablecoin supply and $15.6T settled in 2024, the
platforms aggregating and managing digital-dollar liquidity are
becoming the new global settlement layer.

 FIREBLOCKS ACQUIRES DYNAMIC (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Enterprise custodian Fireblocks acquired Dynamic, a wallet
infrastructure provider powering over 50 million onchain accounts for
customers like Kraken, Magic Eden, and Ondo Finance. Dynamic's
embedded wallet technology enables developers to integrate digital
asset functionality without dedicated crypto engineers, handling user
onboarding, authentication, wallet connections, and funding
integrations. The acquisition combines Fireblocks' institutional-grade
infrastructure serving 2,400+ financial institutions with Dynamic's
developer-first platform, positioning the merged entity to deliver
both enterprise security and consumer-friendly wallet experiences
across fintechs and enterprises. 

 ETHEREUM'S L2 ECONOMICS DON'T ADD UP (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Base, Ethereum's largest Layer 2, pays just $4K per day ($1.5M/year)
to inherit the security of a $460B network, a negligible 0.03 basis
points. This is a sign that Ethereum's current L2 strategy undervalues
its own alignment and security, effectively selling its integrity for
pennies. The ecosystem should refocus on scaling Layer 1 instead of
leasing out trust to L2s at near-zero cost.
