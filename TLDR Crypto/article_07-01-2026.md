 CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE BILL COULD BE DELAYED TO 2027 (4 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 TD Cowen estimates a 50-60% chance of US crypto market structure
legislation passing in 2026, warning that delays could push passage to
2027 and implementation to 2029 due to partisan gridlock. Republicans
need 7-9 Democratic votes to reach the 60-vote Senate filibuster
threshold. Democrats have an incentive to delay until after the 2026
midterms, when they may regain House control. The primary sticking
point is conflict-of-interest language targeting senior officials –
specifically President Trump, who has generated approximately $620M
from crypto ventures. Delayed implementation beyond the next
inauguration would allow Democratic regulators to shape final rules if
they win the 2028 presidency. The crypto industry prefers enactment
under the Trump administration. 

 GOLDMAN SACHS SEES REGULATION DRIVING CRYPTO ADOPTION (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Goldman Sachs research identifies regulatory clarity as the primary
catalyst for institutional crypto adoption. Survey data shows 35% of
institutions cite regulatory uncertainty as the biggest barrier, while
32% view clarity as the top catalyst. Institutional allocations
currently sit at 7% of AUM, but 71% plan increased exposure over the
next 12 months. Bitcoin ETFs reached $115B and ether ETFs surpassed
$20B by the end of 2025, while stablecoins grew to nearly $300B
following recent oversight legislation.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 CURATION > CREATION: CREATOR COINS AREN'T THE PROBLEM (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Creator coins monetize attention correctly but fail within
timeline-based social feeds that reward engagement farming over
substance. A proposed solution shifts Base toward a topic-centric
model, organizing markets around trending subjects rather than
individual creators. The three-tier architecture layers Topics
(contextual trends like “Base App Debate” or “Nick Shirley
Documentary”) over Signals (aggregated metrics including mindshare
velocity, volume, and copy trading ROI) over Market Actions (tradable
instruments spanning memecoins, prediction markets, NFTs, and mini
apps). Attention metrics could guide capital allocation across
multiple instrument types under unified thematic containers. 

 TIP-20: TEMPO'S PAYMENTS-FIRST TOKEN STANDARD (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 TIP-20 extends ERC-20 for real-world payments by adding transfer
memos, an optional native currency identifier, reward-distribution
hooks, policy registries (whitelists/blocklists), role-based controls,
and operational functions like pause/unpause. It routes payment
transactions into Tempo's reserved high-throughput payment lanes and
lets USD-denominated TIP-20 stablecoins pay gas and trade natively on
Tempo's DEX. This standard is aimed at stablecoin issuers and payment
rails, promising easier reconciliation, onchain compliance,
programmable yield distribution, and built-in support for use cases
from corporate treasury and cross-border payments to wholesale
settlement and onchain FX.

 FRED WILSON PREDICTS 2026 UX PIVOT FOR CRYPTO (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Fred Wilson, founding partner of Union Square Ventures and early
investor in Coinbase, Ethereum, and Filecoin, predicts that crypto's
breakthrough in 2026 will come from making blockchains invisible to
end users rather than launching new chains. Wilson forecasts that
better consumer interfaces will allow users to use, spend, trade, and
send tokens without concerning themselves with which blockchain
they're on, handling infrastructure details in the background.
Blockchain innovation will shift to user experience as the critical
factor for mass adoption. 

 STABLECOINS ARE A RAIL, NOT A BRAND (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 PayPal, Klarna, Stripe, and Cash App are adopting stablecoins in
different ways to cut settlement costs, speed up payouts, and expand
globally, but the common thread is integration rather than mass
issuance. While stablecoins meaningfully improve payments economics, a
future with thousands of branded corporate tokens would fragment
liquidity and add friction, making issuance a losing strategy for most
companies. The durable advantage comes from controlling distribution,
user experience, or settlement rails, meaning stablecoins reward
position in the stack, not novelty.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOLDMAN UPGRADES COINBASE STOCK TO BUY (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Goldman Sachs upgraded Coinbase to Buy with a $303 price target (34%
upside from ~$225), citing the exchange's revenue diversification into
structural businesses like custody, staking, and subscriptions, which
now comprise 40% of revenue versus under 5% five years ago. The
upgrade reflects December product launches spanning US equities,
prediction markets, derivatives, and expanded banking services, with
Goldman viewing prediction markets and tokenization as significant TAM
opportunities. However, the firm expects margin pressure from
intensifying competition as traditional brokers add crypto while
crypto-native platforms expand into stocks and banking. Regulatory
risk remains material, with much of the long-term upside contingent on
Congress passing crypto market structure legislation. 

 REDEMPTION CAPACITY IS THE REAL PEG CONSTRAINT (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stablecoins don't fail because blockchains are slow. They fail when
the issuer can't convert coins back into real dollars fast enough. The
peg holds only if the issuer's cash/lines or their processing capacity
can cover redemptions over the stress period. If redemptions outpace
that capacity, the stablecoin's “$1” becomes a market price and
liquidity fragments.
