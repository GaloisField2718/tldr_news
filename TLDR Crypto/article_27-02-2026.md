MARKETS & BUSINESS

 A NEW BIPARTISAN BILL WANTS TO ENSURE THE NEXT CENTURY OF TECH IS
WRITTEN IN AMERICA (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Promoting Innovation in Blockchain Development Act of 2026 would
protect good-faith open-source software developers from Section 1960
criminal statutes designed for money laundering, addressing the legal
gray zone that has chilled American blockchain development
competitiveness. Solana's ecosystem grew 84% year-over-year in new
developers in 2024, illustrating how clear regulatory environments
attract talent building digital financial infrastructure for payments,
DeFi, and identity applications. America must follow its historical
pattern, where regulation followed innovation rather than preceding
it. The upcoming SEC engagement-focused shift under Paul Atkins and
CLARITY Act progress is critical to ensuring talent, standards, and
capital for internet capital markets consolidate domestically rather
than migrating to clearer foreign jurisdictions. 

 GRANT CARDONE PLANS TO TOKENIZE $5B REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Cardone Capital is preparing to tokenize its $5 billion real estate
portfolio to provide investors collateral and secondary market
liquidity, following the firm's 1,000 BTC purchase in June as part of
a broader digital asset strategy. Deloitte projects that $4 trillion
in real estate could be tokenized by 2035 at 27% annual growth, though
uneven regulation and thin secondary market liquidity remain
bottlenecks for the currently small market.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHEREUM'S “STRAWMAP” ROADMAP (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Ethereum Foundation's non-binding "Strawmap" draft outlines five
goals through 2029: reducing finality from 16 minutes to 6-16 seconds,
higher throughput, native privacy via shielded base layer transfers,
post-quantum cryptography, and tighter L2 integration. Vitalik
Buterin's concurrent argument that original L2 roadmap assumptions "no
longer make sense" signals a dual-track strategy where the base layer
strengthens alongside more specialized L2 roles for privacy and
specific applications rather than outsourcing all scaling to rollups.
Researcher Justin Drake framed the vision as "Ethereum becoming the
internet of value, and ether becoming money for the internet" while
acknowledging the Strawmap remains independent from governance and
subject to revision through decentralized debate. 

 STARKNET INTRODUCES STRKBTC FOR PRIVATE, COMPOSABLE BITCOIN ON L2 (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Starknet's strkBTC is a bitcoin-backed asset issued deterministically
from verifiable BTC deposits that provides shielded balances and
confidential transfers at the protocol layer while preserving full
DeFi composability and eligibility for staking and yield. The system
uses client-side proving with fast verification to scale privacy for
complex financial transactions and aims to unlock institutional
capital by removing privacy-related barriers.

 HOW TO BUILD A VC FIRM (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dragonfly's Haseeb Qureshi shares how the firm grew from a first-time
manager in the 2018 crypto winter to a $4 billion platform launching
Fund IV at $650 million by finding the east-west arbitrage edge nobody
else wanted due to punishing hours, then optimizing like a startup
with rigorous feedback loops and data tracking rather than "vibe
investing." The non-consensus right deals principle drives portfolio
construction as venture returns follow power laws, where the top three
investments outperform everything else combined, making hit rate
irrelevant compared to taking big swings on idiosyncratically
underpriced opportunities like Ethena's seed post-Terra collapse and
Polymarket before the 2024 election. Institutional brand-building
requires distributing through individual team members' public voices,
cultivating platform power to move things for founders, and
fundraising when markets are hot, while deploying when prices are low,
despite LP psychology almost always running opposite to optimal
timing. 

 THE END STATE OF INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Institutional crypto adoption is an extraction strategy where TradFi
accumulates fee-bearing AUM rather than advancing crypto's founding
principles. The $300 billion stablecoin market, $90-100 billion DeFi
TVL, and tokenized RWA assets earning 2-4% yields represent an
under-monetized capital pool that institutions are systematically
packaging into tokenized funds, MMFs, and structured products to
extract fee streams. AI capex investment demands are simultaneously
draining global capital pools, intensifying competition for any
identifiable AUM, including onchain treasuries, as traditional LP
channels slow distributions and asset managers seek new backfill
sources. Without scaling crypto-native institutions, asset managers,
and financial products capable of competing for treasury AUM,
institutional adoption won't be a victory, it will be an annexation.

 AAVE “WILL WIN” PROPOSAL FACES PUSHBACK AS NAY LEADS (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Aave DAO's Snapshot “Aave Will Win” temp check is live with NAY
leading after Aave Labs kept the $51 million ask largely unchanged,
only softening V3 deprecation language and removing the 8 to 12 month
migration timeline while leaving bundling, accountability reporting,
KPI disclosures, AAVE holdings transparency, and discretionary revenue
deductions intact. Critics also noted that 663K voting power is tied
to wallets connected to Aave founding infrastructure, an amount large
enough to sway the outcome if deployed. 

 LARGEST BNB TREASURY CRASHES 95% (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 CEA Industries, a former Canadian vape retailer that pivoted to
become the largest BNB treasury company at the height of DAT mania,
crashed 95% from its $82.88 peak in July 2025 to $3.88 after a $500
million PIPE transaction led by 10X Capital with Cantor Fitzgerald as
placement agent. The company is demanding CZ's YZi Labs disclose a
confidentiality provision around its "secret side agreement" with 10X
Capital, while YZi Labs contests the characterization and seeks board
changes through stockholder written consents. The collapse mirrors
broader DAT carnage as Nakamoto declined 99%, Twenty One fell 89%, and
Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company dropped 37%, with major funds
including Pantera Capital, GSR, and Arrington Capital among the PIPE
investors suffering losses.
