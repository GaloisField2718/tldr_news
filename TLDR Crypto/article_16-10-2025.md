 CLOUDFLARE PARTNERS WITH VISA, MASTERCARD, & AMEX ON AI AGENT
PAYMENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Cloudflare is partnering with Visa, Mastercard, and American Express
to develop authentication and payment standards for AI-powered
“agentic commerce”, where autonomous software agents transact on
behalf of users. The collaboration introduces the Trusted Agent
Protocol, enabling merchants to verify AI bots through Cloudflare's
Web Bot Auth system. It follows Cloudflare's plans for a NET Dollar
stablecoin and its x402 Foundation partnership with Coinbase to create
universal machine-to-machine payment rails. 

 CRYPTO BANK EREBOR APPROVED FOR BANK CHARTER (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency granted conditional
national bank status to Erebor Bank, a tech-oriented lender targeting
technology companies and ultra-high-net-worth individuals using
virtual currencies, with OCC chief Jonathan Gould calling it "proof
that the OCC under my leadership does not impose blanket barriers to
banks that want to engage in digital asset activities." The
preliminary conditional approval marks the first new-bank charter
under Gould's tenure and follows years of Anchorage Digital standing
alone as the only crypto-oriented OCC-chartered bank since 2021,
though multiple digital asset firms have recently moved to seek
federal charters as Trump-appointed regulators reverse earlier
government resistance.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ALIPAY LAUNCHES ETHEREUM LAYER 2 “JOVAY” (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Alipay, the world's largest fintech with over 1B users, has launched
Jovay, a Layer 2 blockchain built on Ethereum through Ant Group's Ant
Digital Technologies. Jovay focuses on tokenized real-world assets,
instant low-cost transactions, and cross-chain value flows secured by
Ethereum. The move could bring billions in tokenized assets, from
supply-chain invoices to digital bonds, into DeFi liquidity pools
while serving as a regulatory bridge between traditional finance and
onchain markets. 

 BRIDGE APPLIES FOR US NATIONAL TRUST BANK CHARTER (2 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Bridge has filed an application with the US Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (OCC) to establish a national trust bank, aligning
with the new GENIUS Act framework for regulated dollar tokens. The
proposed bank would handle custody, stablecoin issuance, and reserve
management, creating federally supervised infrastructure for tokenized
money. CEO Zach Abrams said the move reflects Bridge's belief that
stablecoins are a foundational pillar of the future financial system,
enabling the tokenization of trillions in assets under full regulatory
oversight.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 TOKENIZED GOLD YIELD FARMING GUIDE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tokenized gold yields involve collateralizing XAUT or PAXG on
platforms like Fluid for 4.5% base yield, then borrowing stablecoins
against the collateral with strategies ranging from low-risk simple
lending aggregators at 3% net APR to medium-risk Pendle PT positions
at 12.5% to higher-risk syrupUSDT loops at 13.5%, calculated as LTV
multiplied by the spread between stablecoin yield and borrow cost.
Morpho offers the highest 77% LLTV with 5% borrow costs for both PAXG
and XAUT, though with thinner liquidity, while Aave provides XAUT with
75% LLTV, 3-6% borrowing rates on USDC/USDT/USDe, and billions in
available liquidity across Ethereum and Plasma, making it the deepest
market. 

 THE PRIVACY LAYER (40 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Onchain privacy has evolved from failed attempts, including CoinJoin
mixers with <1% Bitcoin transaction usage, Monero's regulatory
delisting despite technical success, Zcash's optional privacy leading
to only 5% shielded adoption, and Tornado Cash's $16 billion volume
ending in OFAC sanctions after 30% of deposits were illicit,
demonstrating that pure anonymity without compliance fails at scale.
Scroll's Cloak enables selective disclosure where transactions are
processed by permissioned sequencers generating ZK proofs without
publishing raw data onchain, allowing businesses to hide details from
competitors while providing audit trails to regulators, with live
implementations including ether.fi Cash processing $65+ million across
785,000 transactions and Shiga Digital bringing private stablecoin
finance to African markets. Vitalik Buterin emphasizes privacy as a
required feature for Ethereum, advocating for privacy pools with
compliance proofs and selective disclosure rather than total opacity
as the path forward for the next decade.

 THE BULLISH CASE FOR BITTENSOR'S FIRST HALVING (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Bittensor's first halving in December will cut TAO emissions by 50%,
reducing sell pressure and mirroring Bitcoin's deflationary cycles.
Unlike Bitcoin, Bittensor's dual-token model adds complexity. Subnet
tokens (Alpha) share liquidity pools with TAO, meaning halved
emissions tighten liquidity and amplify volatility. The network's
strongest subnets should gain share as weaker ones fall off. Like
Bitcoin, Bittensor's halving is seen not as a risk, but as a stress
test that strengthens the system. 

 MONAD CLAIM PAGE IS MORE THAN YOU THINK (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Monad claiming page currently shows six tiers based on social
activity across X, Telegram, Farcaster, and NFT holdings, with
strength scores up to 6, but the "60/40 theory" suggests 40% of the
final score remains missing and could be filled by testnet activity
considerations when the team updates scoring in coming days.
Alternative theories include the page evolving with gamified
mini-games allowing users to battle community members and adjust
strength scores, the team actively watching post-October 14 mainnet
activity to identify who's still engaged before final allocation, and
potential features like validator staking now live on testnet
affecting scores or liquidity pledge options allocating to ecosystem
projects upon the October 28 claiming. The core thesis emphasizes that
the claiming page represents more than the current static interface,
with the strength score serving as a meaningful indicator rather than
just a multiplier, while organic testnet transactions and continued
engagement may still matter for the highest tiers despite many
treating October 14 as the finish line.
