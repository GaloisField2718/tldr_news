MARKETS & BUSINESS

 INACTIVE BITCOIN SUPPLY DECREASES AS HOLDERS SELL (2 MINUTE READ) [4]


 The proportion of Bitcoin's circulating supply not moved for over a
year has dropped to an 18-month low (65.8%), suggesting a shift from
previous holding patterns and potential profit-taking following the
significant price increases since last April. This downward trend in
inactive supply, coinciding with Bitcoin's price surge, could indicate
a nearing peak of the current bull market. 

 ETHEREUM ETF HOPES FADE AS SEC'S CRYPTO CRACKDOWN DASHES APPROVAL
EXPECTATIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Optimism about the Ethereum ETFs being approved in May has decreased
as experts continue to share their opinions. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck
stated that he believes the company's ETF application will be rejected
in May and CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti said he does not think
any Proof-of-Stake coins will be approved this year.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ANNOUNCING: EIGENLAYER AND EIGENDA MAINNET LAUNCH (4 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Restaking protocol EigenLayer has launched its much-anticipated
mainnet and EigenDA data availability service. Actively validated
services (AVS) can now register with the protocol, and operators can
begin receiving delegations from restakers and opt-in to supporting
AVSs. EigenDA is the first AVS, which promises to be an
Ethereum-aligned data availability solution with unprecedented
performance. This beta launch does not include in-protocol payments
from AVSs to operators or slashing, which will be included once the
marketplace stabilizes. 

 A16Z RELEASES JOLT, A ZKVM (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 a16z has released an open-source code for Jolt, a zero-knowledge
virtual machine (zkVM), marking a commitment to deep tech R&D. Jolt,
which supports RISC-V ISA and Rust language applications, uses
cryptographic techniques to enhance the scalability, speed, and
privacy of blockchain operations. This tech can be integrated into
zkEVMs and blockchain-based ZK applications.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 EIGENLAYER: THE BLACKHOLE FOR ETHEREUM (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Franklin Templetonâ€™s Digital Asset Division released a one-page
report on EigenLayer. The report introduces the restaking narrative,
describing it as a way to secure multiple networks simultaneously and
increase the yield from staking ETH. EigenLayerâ€™s immense growth
over the past year is attributed to the potential token airdrop to
stakers. It has captured over 1% of the total ETH supply with over 2
million ETH restaked in the protocol. 

 BLOCKCHAIN'S "DIAL-UP TO BROADBAND" MOMENT (20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Much like how broadband revolutionized the utility of the internet,
Layer 2 scaling solutions have brought new possibilities for
blockchain applications. This article expands on how Arbitrum, a
portfolio company, is leading the L2 landscape in terms of total value
locked, revenue share, and developer activity. It also covers other
stories, including how UNIâ€™s fee switch legitimizes token value,
regulatory updates, and debunks arguments about the death of crypto.
