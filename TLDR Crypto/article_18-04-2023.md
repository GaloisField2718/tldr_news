SEC CHARGES CRYPTO EXCHANGE BITTREX FOR VIOLATING US SECURITIES LAWS
(2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.engadget.com/sec-charges-crypto-exchange-bittrex-for-violating-us-securities-laws-164021896.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


The SEC has accused Bittrex and its former CEO, William Shihara, of
running an unregistered securities exchange. The complaint claims that
Bittrex generated at least $1.3 billion in revenue between 2017 and
2022 without proper registration. The SEC also alleges Bittrex worked
with crypto issuers to dispose of problematic statements to avoid
regulatory scrutiny. Coincidentally, Bittrex announced it was leaving
the US market last month, citing regulatory uncertainty as the main
driver, and the Company plans to challenge the lawsuit unless a
reasonable settlement is offered. 

TETHER MARKET CAP EYES RECORD HIGH AFTER REGAINING 65% STABLECOIN
DOMINANCE (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-market-cap-eyes-record-high-after-regaining-65-stablecoin-dominance?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Tether's market cap has reached nearly $81 billion, up 20% YTD, as it
outperforms rivals USDC and BUSD amid the US banking crisis and crypto
crackdown. While market participants think USDC and BUSD would be
affected by both further banking crises and regulatory action, they
seem to believe USDT is relatively insulated from this. USDC‚Äôs
market cap has dropped over 25% YTD, while Binance USD has seen a 60%
drop in 2023. Capital flowed directly into USDT from USDC and BUSD as
regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty about the global banking system
increased. This has pushed USDT‚Äôs market share over 65%, the highest
it‚Äôs been since May 2021.

GATING DAPPS USING ANY ON-CHAIN DATA OR TRANSACTION (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://twitter.com/thatguyintech/status/1647865698159587330?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Gating-as-a-Service is a new project that allows dapps to be gated
using any on-chain data or transaction(s). Users can create gates
using contracts and ABIs, select events and functions, and integrate
their gates via SDK. GaaS enables the configuration of gates to check
for specific user personas based on on-chain activity, allowing dapps
to cater to a wider audience. The gates are stored on-chain, making
them shareable and accessible without relying on a central authority.
This service aims to benefit DeFi protocols by targeting specific user
groups.

insights from important players and thinkers in the space, making them
a potential goldmine for alpha. Some of the top podcasts include Bell

trends; Bankless, known for its consistent and timely coverage of the

SPOTTING CRYTPO PUMPS LED BY KOREA EARLY ON (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1647935382087139328?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


South Korea has become a major crypto hub, driven by local support for
web3 development, a strong economy, and a heavy focus on tech and
innovation. This thread highlights how to spot crypto pumps led by
Korea early on. A few things you can do are monitor new listings on
exchanges like Upbit, track trading pair volume on CoinMarketCap, use
a bot to detect unusual volume spikes, and look for coins with a high
fully diluted valuation but low float. We saw the powerful effects the
Korean market could have on coins with LUNA and more recently with
Aptos. With the retail market in South Korea growing rapidly,
following trends coming out of this region will be increasingly
important, especially in the next bull run.

STABLECOINS GAIN TRACTION AS INFLATIONARY SHIELD IN LATIN AMERICA WITH
GROWTH IN EUROPE (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/17/stablecoins-gain-traction-as-inflationary-shield-in-latin-america-europe-also-sees-growth/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Stablecoin adoption has continued to rise worldwide, as a large
percentage of the volume on crypto exchanges has involved stablecoins
and many participants have fled to stablecoins during volatile times
in the crypto markets. Adoption varies by region; for example, in
Latin America, everyday citizens use stablecoins to protect against
inflation, while in Europe, seasoned traders and investors use
stablecoins to limit volatility. Argentina-based Num Finance's CEO
Agust√≠n Liserra notes the stablecoin market's participation and
capitalization have grown despite the bear market. The key value
proposition for crypto in Latin America has become value storage and
remittances, which gives stablecoins great product-market-fit, while
the main value propositions in Europe have been DeFi and NFT trading
and investing. 

REP. DAVIDSON TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO FIRE SEC BOSS GENSLER FOR
CRYPTO OVERREACH (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://cointelegraph.com/news/rep-davidson-to-introduce-legislation-to-fire-sec-boss-gensler-for-crypto-overreach?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


US Representative Warren Davidson plans to introduce legislation to
remove SEC chair Gary Gensler, following the SEC's announcement that
it would revisit the definition of an "exchange" with an intent to
include both CeFi and DeFi protocols in a redefinition. Davidson is
proposing replacing the role with an Executive Director reporting to
the board. The new rule amendments, criticized by SEC commissioner
Hester Peirce, are seen as an overreach that could affect
participation in the crypto space and push innovation in the space
overseas. The SEC has been avoiding laying out clear regulations and
has instead been making the law with precedents on a case-by-case
basis. Lack of regulation coupled with severe enforcement actions
makes it impossible for any crypto companies to be ‚Äúcompliant‚Äù or
to know what the boundaries actually are.
