MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN TREASURY COMPANIES STRUGGLE TO HALT PLUNGE (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Bitcoin treasury companies attempting to replicate MicroStrategy's
success have suffered massive investor losses ranging from 38% for
Strategy to 94% for KindlyMD over the past three months, with declines
beginning well before BTC's recent peak above $126,000 on October 3rd
and subsequent 11-day plunge. Executive teams have been active on
social media defending business models, with Metaplanet CEO Simon
Gerovich explaining preferred stock issuance benefits, KindlyMD CEO
David Bailey denying "FTX vibes" claims as the stock trades below $1
facing Nasdaq delisting, and Strive CIO Ben Werkman arguing valuations
have reached "deep value territory" as companies move to a "second
phase" leveraging intact balance sheets. While Strategy shares rose
from $30 during 2022's crypto winter to $290 today despite recent
declines, demonstrating potential for BTCTC comebacks, the current
negative sentiment and widespread share price carnage suggest
replicating MicroStrategy's first-mover success will require more than
just rising bitcoin prices. 

 OPENSEA'S SEA TOKEN LAUNCH AND REVENUE BUYBACK PLAN (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer announced that the platform's long-awaited
SEA token will launch in Q1 2026, with 50% of the supply going to OG
users and rewards participants, and half of the platform's revenue at
launch allocated to token buybacks. The release coincides with
OpenSea's pivot into a multi-chain crypto trading hub supporting
perps, NFTs, and tokens, alongside a forthcoming mobile app rollout.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PICO PRISM: 99.6% REAL-TIME PROVING FOR ETHEREUM ON CONSUMER HARDWARE
(8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Brevis achieved 99.6% real-time proving coverage for 45M gas Ethereum
blocks using 64 consumer-grade RTX 5090 GPUs across 8 servers, with
96.8% of blocks proven under the Ethereum Foundation's 10-second
standard and 6.9-second average proving time. The system delivers 3.4x
better performance efficiency than Succinct's SP1 Hypercube
state-of-the-art, achieving 98.9% versus 40.9% coverage under 10
seconds for 36M gas blocks, 6.04-second versus 10.3-second average
proving time, and $128k versus $256k GPU costs using half the hardware
with 64 GPUs instead of 160. Pico Prism's breakthrough comes from
completely redesigning the computational pipeline into embarrassingly
parallel phases with computation-heavy workloads shifted to GPUs while
setup tasks remain on CPUs, delivering near-linear acceleration when
scaling across multi-machine, multi-GPU setups. The team's roadmap
targets 99% real-time proving with fewer than 16 RTX 5090 GPUs in the
coming months while maintaining the Ethereum Foundation's goals of
sub-$100k hardware capex and sub-10kW power draw for on-premises
proving. 

 UNISWAP ADDS SOLANA SUPPORT (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethereum's largest decentralized exchange Uniswap has integrated
Solana support into its web app, providing easy access to Solana,
Ethereum, and 13 other chains in one interface and potentially
unifying the two largest DeFi ecosystems. The integration simplifies
user experience by allowing traders to connect Solana wallets and
trade SOL tokens alongside Ethereum assets without using complex
bridges or switching between different wallets and applications,
removing barriers that previously affected both novice and experienced
traders. Uniswap processes over $3.7 billion in 24-hour trading volume
according to DeFiLlama, and the cross-chain functionality enables
users to access Solana's speed and low costs through the familiar
Uniswap platform while addressing the DeFi fragmentation problem.

 STATE OF CRYPTO FUNDRAISING: Q3 2025 (29 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Total capital raised in Q3 2025 increased 47% quarter-over-quarter to
$8.21 billion, reversing a two-year downtrend and marking the highest
quarterly fundraising since Q1 2023, though deal count declined 16% to
480 transactions while investor participation rose 13% to 1,200 unique
investors from Q2's record low. The top ten funding rounds raised
$4.27 billion, led by Bullish's $1.11 billion IPO, surpassing Circle
as the largest crypto IPO since Coinbase, Figure's $788 million IPO,
pump.fun's $600 million public token sale at $4 billion valuation,
Kraken's $500 million round at $15 billion valuation, preparing for
2026 IPO, and Rapyd's $500 million Series F, demonstrating a shift
toward public market participation over token-based fundraising. M&A
activity remained robust with 80 deals despite 6% quarterly decline
from Q1's record 85 deals, with top acquisitions including Solowin's
$350 million AlloyX purchase, Ripple's $200 million Rail acquisition
for stablecoin payments, LayerZero's $120 million Stargate Finance
acquisition after four-way bidding war, Polymarket's $112 million QCEX
purchase for US market re-entry, and Talos's $100 million Coin Metrics
acquisition backed by Citi. Newly launched funds raised $2.31 billion
led by Sora Ventures' $1 billion Bitcoin Treasury Fund, 50T Fund V's
$500 million growth equity vehicle, and Ondo Catalyst's $250 million
RWA-focused fund, while Payments, Gaming, and DEX sectors led deal
activity with AI Agents and RWAs showing steepest accelerator growth
despite overall accelerator activity declining 56% to 88 deals.

 STABLECOINS ARE 'CENTRAL BUSINESS DIGITAL CURRENCIES' (6 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Privately-issued stablecoins are "central business digital currency"
featuring all the surveillance, backdoors, programmability, and
controls of CBDCs, plus unique risks, and that issuers like JPMorgan
could freeze funds and unbank users through the Patriot Act or future
regulations. Overcollateralized stablecoins backed by cash and
short-term government securities face bank run risks if too many
holders attempt simultaneous redemptions, while algorithmic and
synthetic stablecoins carry counterparty risks and de-pegging
vulnerabilities from volatility or flash crashes in crypto derivatives
markets. 

 THE TWO-STABLECOIN FUTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Every fiat currency will eventually have two stablecoins. One is a
“spending” version for daily commerce, and the other, a
“savings” version backed by tokenized government bonds. This dual
model will mirror power laws in FX, where most coins never rival USDT
or USDC but still enable frictionless participation in local
economies. Governments will back the shift to prevent dollarization,
while onchain currencies will cut out FX middlemen, keeping more value
with workers and businesses.
