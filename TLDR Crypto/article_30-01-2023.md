MINUTE READ)

A CryptoPunk, which usually goes for a minimum of $100,000, was
exchanged for a complete set of tokens from an unknown collection
called The Memes on January 19. The Memes collection has seen a
19-fold increase in value in the NFT market over the past three
months. Founded by Punk6529, the concept behind The Memes collection
is that memes, which are transmittable units of culture, can be owned
in the form of NFTs. It is uncertain if owning an NFT of The Memes
collection actually gives ownership of the culture unit. The Memes has
a unique token minting model, which involves continuously minting new
tokens, that has been successful in attracting investors.

Governments have intensified their crackdowns on crypto money
laundering and additional enforcement is expected. New evidence
suggests that blockchain tracing and crackdowns on illicit activities
have reduced the number of money laundering outlets, making it harder
for the crypto black market to cash out its proceeds. Nearly 68
percent of black market cash-outs are handled by just five
cryptocurrency exchanges. In 2022, over $6.3 billion of illicit funds
were tracked to just 542 cryptocurrency addresses, with four addresses
receiving $1.1 billion of those funds.
