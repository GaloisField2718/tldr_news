 STARKNET ON BITCOIN: SCALING BITCOIN FOR MASS USE (5 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Starknet has released plans to settle simultaneously on Bitcoin and
Ethereum, becoming a single self-custodial decentralized L2. StarkWare
is launching a $1 million fund to spur the development and
introduction of OP_CAT, the Bitcoin opcode needed to make a trustless
L2 possible. Beyond scaling Bitcoin to thousands of transactions per
second, simultaneous settlement would allow for BTC/ETH atomic swaps
and private BTC transactions, along with many other possibilities.

stream management, and grant analysis to optimize governance
initiatives. The ecosystem growth framework will primarily analyze the
flywheel effect and how to incentivize new users to NEAR, focusing on
evaluating liquidity mining programs.

 CONSENSUS 2024 TAKEAWAYS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The biggest crypto conference of the year did not have many new
themes, instead reinforcing growing narratives. Traditional finance
institutions were very present and the future of regulation was the
most discussed topic. Bitcoin's growing Runes and L2 ecosystem was
given as much attention as any other ecosystem, even more than SOL
memecoins. People are becoming skeptical about the AI x crypto
narrative, though DePIN is becoming more legitimized.

crypto fantasy games and now has over 3 million users. Smaller studios
have abandoned projects after raising over a billion dollars
cumulatively. Other games are targeting specific niches, like
Parallel's focus on AI, Off The Grid's console experience, or Mythical
Games' Pudgy Penguin mobile app.
