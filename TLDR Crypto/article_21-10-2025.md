MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO'S HALF-FINISHED LEGISLATIVE AGENDA TEETERS (5 MINUTE READ) [4]


 Top crypto executives, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong,
Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, Uniswap's Hayden Adams, and
Solana Policy Institute President Kristin Smith, are meeting with up
to 10 Senate Democrats on Wednesday to revive stalled market structure
legislation after controversial DeFi discussion language threatened
negotiations. The crypto market structure bill establishing rules and
oversight for US crypto markets has languished as Trump's August
deadline passed followed by Senator Tim Scott's September 30 deadline,
with Senator Cynthia Lummis suggesting end-of-year as more realistic,
though former Scott general counsel Mannar Hanna predicts next year
completion given Congress's packed agenda. While the House passed its
Digital Asset Market Clarity Act and Trump signed stablecoin
regulation into law, Senate progress has slowed amid contentious
negotiations and the federal government shutdown, with the CEO meeting
aiming to get conversations back on track. 

 BLOCKCHAIN.COM HAS HELD TALKS TO GO PUBLIC VIA SPAC (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Blockchain.com has held talks about going public via a SPAC listing
with Cohen & Company Capital Markets advising on a potential deal,
though it's unclear if discussions are ongoing. The crypto exchange
and wallet provider's valuation history shows significant volatility,
rising from $5.2 billion post-money valuation in March 2021 to $14
billion in 2022 before declining to $7 billion in November 2023's $110
million funding round. The company is signaling progress by appointing
former Goldman Sachs executive Justin Evans as CFO and ex-Point72
portfolio manager Mike Wilcox as COO.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ROBINHOOD TOKENIZES NEARLY 500 US STOCKS, ETFS ON ARBITRUM (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Robinhood has deployed 493 tokenized assets worth over $8.5 million
on Arbitrum, adding 80 new stock tokens in recent days, including
Galaxy, Webull, and Synopsys, with stocks accounting for 70% of tokens
and ETFs representing 24%. The tokens are structured as
blockchain-based derivatives regulated under the EU's MiFID II rather
than representing direct share ownership, offering 24-hour market
access, no hidden fees beyond 0.1% FX charges, and a 1 euro minimum
investment, though it has drawn scrutiny from Lithuania's banking
regulator, who has requested structural clarification. 

 INTRODUCING PRIVATE MULTISIG (35 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A privacy-preserving multisig wallet implementation combines Merkle
tree membership proofs for participant anonymity, aggregated ECC
ElGamal encryption for confidential vote casting with bias-free
decision making, and Distributed Key Generation eliminating
centralized trusted entities, though requiring all participants to
vote before revealing outcomes. The system uses babyJubJub key pairs
derived from ECDSA signatures via deterministic KDF rather than wallet
addresses to reduce identification probability from 1 to 1/N where N
is member count, while homomorphic vote aggregation allows summing
encrypted votes without decrypting individual ballots until the final
decryption key share completes. Limitations include the last voter
advantage, where final participants can decrypt prior votes before
casting their own, proposal frontrunning possibilities despite
deterministic challenge derivation, participant removal deadlocks if
removed members don't vote, causing proposals to expire, and linear
scalability complexity for vote revelation.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 EXPLAINING GKR FOR FAST HASH-PROVING (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The GKR protocol turns large “batch and layers” computations like
Poseidon2 hashing into simple polynomial evaluations, letting provers
commit only to inputs and outputs. With tricks like reducing rounds,
batching linear layers, and optimizing sumchecks, GKR achieves around
15x theoretical overhead and under 10x in practice, potentially
reaching single-digit overhead. This proving system is the basis
behind proposals to reduce the time required to verify Ethereum
blocks. 

 COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE AND PREDICTION MARKETS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Prediction markets transform collective intelligence into a
structured, incentivized system where people are rewarded for accurate
insights. Unlike open-source projects or Wikipedia, which rely on
voluntary contributions, prediction markets aggregate diverse
information through financial stakes, encouraging better, data-driven
forecasts. By giving experts and informed outsiders monetary
incentives to share knowledge, these markets create more accurate
crowd predictions. There are remaining challenges around liquidity and
market diversity, but crypto-based prediction platforms are closing
the gap between human collaboration and actionable forecasting.

 ETHEREUM'S “SUPERCYCLE” NARRATIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum's open design enabled speculative waves (ICOs and NFTs) that
drained large amounts of ETH from long-term holders to grifters and
retail, creating persistent sell pressure that slowed appreciation.
With those excesses largely behind it and institutional demand
growing, ETH is entering a “supercycle” marked by steadier, less
euphoric growth and stronger performance during market corrections. 

 SOLANA'S $500M STABLECOIN LEAK (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Solana's $14.5B in USDC and USDT supply generates roughly $580M in
annual interest for Circle and Tether, none of which returns to
Solana. This interest, reinvested by issuers and their partners like
Coinbase and Base, effectively subsidizes rival ecosystems while
Solana earns nothing. Unless Solana coordinates around yield-bearing
and ecosystem-aligned stable assets, it will continue to fund
competitors' growth.

 HEDGING CRYPTO GAINS WITH POLYMARKET (2 MINUTE READ) [13]
