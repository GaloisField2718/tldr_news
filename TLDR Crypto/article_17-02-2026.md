 IF ETHEREUM BECOMES THE WORLD'S SETTLEMENT LAYER, ALIGNED IS THE
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAKES IT HAPPEN (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Less than 1% of global financial assets are on-chain. The first wave
moved value onto Ethereum. The next - moving real financial
infrastructure - requires a stack that doesn't exist yet. Businesses
are stitching together patchwork vendors for wallets, rollups,
verification, and compliance. That doesn't scale.

Aligned [4] closes that gap. A packaged, Ethereum-native business
suite - verification (100x cheaper, $5.6B+ restaked ETH), proof
aggregation, rollups, interoperability - is already bringing
businesses onto Ethereum.

$ALIGN token sale [5] runs Feb 7-18. Be part of making Ethereum
inevitable.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 HARVARD TRIMS BITCOIN ETF, BUILDS $87M ETHER POSITION (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Harvard Management Company cut its iShares Bitcoin Trust holdings by
about 21% in Q4 while opening a new $86.8 million position in
BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust. This leaves bitcoin as its largest
publicly disclosed holding at $265.8 million amid volatile crypto
prices and academic scrutiny of the endowment's digital-asset
strategy. 

 GLOBAL ETP OUTFLOWS EXTEND TO FOURTH WEEK AS $3.7B EXITS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Global crypto ETPs saw a fourth consecutive week of outflows ($173
million last week and $3.74 billion over the past month), driven by
$403 million of redemptions from US-listed products while Europe and
Canada absorbed $230 million in inflows. Trading volumes decreased
from $63 billion to $27 billion and bitcoin and ether led withdrawals
even as pockets of demand flowed into XRP and Solana.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ANIMOCA BRANDS WINS DUBAI VASP LICENSE (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Animoca Brands secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider license from
Dubai's VARA that lets it begin broker-dealer and digital-asset
management and investment operations in the Emirate. This builds on
prior in-principle approval in Abu Dhabi and supports its
institutional services and Nasdaq reverse-merger ambitions. 

 THE WHATSAPP MOMENT FOR MONEY IS HERE (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stablecoins moved $12 trillion last year, nearing Visa's $17 trillion
volume. Integration by Stripe and SpaceX demonstrates how programmable
money reduces fees and bypasses fragile banking systems. With $140
billion in US debt holdings, stablecoin issuers are becoming critical
pillars of global financial infrastructure.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE STABLECOIN USE CASE LATAM ACTUALLY WANTS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Latin America's 57 million crypto users primarily use stablecoins and
Bitcoin as savings vehicles rather than for trading or payments. The
existing payment infrastructure is more advanced than Western founders
assume – Brazil's PIX enables free instant transfers while offering
~15% treasury yields, and 71% of Mexican adults use SPEI for low-value
transactions. Trust remains the critical moat in a region where 52% of
respondents distrust their financial systems, as demonstrated by
NuBank achieving 3x higher NPS than incumbent banks.

 IT'S TIME TO GIVE THE ROBOTS MONEY (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Agentic payments are emerging as an investable vertical, with
traditional payment rails blocked by KYC/AML barriers forcing AI
agents toward alternative infrastructure. The market is bifurcating
between crypto-native solutions (Coinbase x402) and corporate
approaches (Google AP2, Mastercard Agent Pay, Shopify UCP, Stripe, and
Visa). There are around 100 AI-first startups exceeding $100M ARR with
stablecoins on L2s like Base serving as settlement rails. 

 A LITERARY EXPLANATION FOR THE CRYPTO CRASH (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Crypto's current downturn is a narrative "second act" — the longest
and most contentious phase before resolution. There are parallels to
historical crashes that preceded massive rallies: 1978 Peak Oil, 2008
housing, and 2017's short-vol trade. Crypto's early 2026 crash signals
it's "about to take over, then take off."
