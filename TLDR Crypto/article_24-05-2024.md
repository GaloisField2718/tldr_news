 BIDEN ADMINISTRATION STATEMENT ON FIT21 (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Though Biden's administration opposes the passage of FIT21, it says
it is willing to work with Congress to create a balanced regulatory
framework for digital assets. Its goal is to reinforce United States
leadership in the global financial system. This statement comes at a
time when crypto is becoming an increasingly politicized issue with
the 2024 election looming. 

 SEC APPROVES 8 ETHEREUM ETFS INCLUDING BLACKROCK AND FIDELITY (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The SEC has approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs from issuers, including
BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, months after approving spot
Bitcoin ETFs. While the approval of the 19b-4 forms marks a
significant step, trading will only start after the S-1 statements
have been registered, which may take weeks.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTERNET COMPUTER SMART CONTRACTS WORK WITH ANY EVM (1 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 The Dfinity Foundation has released a new API that enables Internet
Computer smart contracts to be compatible with any EVM (improves
cross-chain interaction and app potential). This move is part of
Dfinity's broader Chain Fusion initiative, which looks to increase
blockchain interoperability. 

 EVM NATIVE SEQUENCING RULES (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum has been criticized for block builders' increasing dominance
over their chain control, which is a consequence of how time-discrete
systems create varied value in their storage slots. This author
proposes a specification for native transaction bundling for onchain
applications, which gives more control over sequencing.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 DEEP DIVE INTO FIT21 (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 FIT21 divides digital assets into three categories: digital
commodities (regulated by the CFTC), restricted digital assets
(regulated by the SEC), and permitted stablecoins. Classification
depends on factors such as the level of decentralization and
functionality of the blockchain, how the asset is acquired, and who
holds the asset. While the bill is a thoughtful approach to bridging
the gap between traditional finance and crypto, it could be improved
by expressly discarding the Howey and Reves tests for digital asset
categorization to prevent SEC jurisdiction backdoors. 

 10 RULES FOR CRYPTO MARKETING & COMMUNITY (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Effective crypto marketing and community building should be
approached as a complex system with various interconnected events and
outputs, rather than one-off strategies. Projects should prioritize
investing in their community, interacting with community content,
emphasizing quality over quantity, and treating community members as
real people with valuable feedback. These tips help give projects
sustainable community flywheels to set them apart in the attention
economy.

 HOW DO LAYER 2S REALLY DIFFER FROM EXECUTION SHARDING? (12 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 While layer 2s and execution sharding may seem like opposite
strategies for blockchain scaling, they share the same underlying
technologies, such as data sharding, fraud proofs, and
cross-communication solutions. The primary difference is that L2s
allow for greater creativity and independent innovation, with each L2
having its own rules, while shards are protocol-level. The L2-centric
ecosystem does face coordination challenges, smart contract wallet
support, and decentralized validation infrastructure. 

 CRYPTO'S KILLER USE-CASES (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article discusses some of the use cases in web3, specifically
the potential of Web3 publisher-exchanges. Web 3 publisher-exchanges
combine the abilities of publishers and exchanges to streamline user
interactions and financial transactions on content platforms. The
combination improves UX/UI by removing friction from transactions and
making transactions more immediate and integrated with content
consumption.
