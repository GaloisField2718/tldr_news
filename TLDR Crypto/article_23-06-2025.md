MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TEXAS SIGNS STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE BILL INTO LAW (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Texas became the third state to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve
after Governor Greg Abbott signed SB 21 into law, creating a
stand-alone, publicly funded fund managed by the Texas Comptroller of
Public Accounts. The companion HB 4488 shields the reserve from
periodic treasury fund-sweeps and ensures its legal existence even if
no BTC is purchased by next summer. Industry observers, including the
Texas Blockchain Council, anticipate the state investing tens of
millions of dollars into the fund. 

 BTC DROPS BELOW $100K FOLLOWING U.S. STRIKES ON IRAN (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Crypto markets plunged after US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites
triggered over $1 billion in liquidations within 24 hours, primarily
from long positions, sending Bitcoin below $100,000 for the first time
in 45 days. Altcoins suffered steeper losses, while the top 30 tokens
by market cap held up best. Traders also braced for oil-price
volatility after Iran's parliament hinted at closing the Strait of
Hormuz. The nine-day BTC ETF inflow streak faces potential disruption
amid the price drop.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 UNISWAP, MORPHO, AND OTHERS COLLABORATE ON WEB3SOC (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Uniswap Labs, Morpho, Maple Finance, Kiln, and Steakhouse Financial
along with security firms Cantina and Secureum have rolled out
Web3SOC, a structured framework inspired by SOC controls that
evaluates DeFi projects' maturity across security, governance,
compliance, and finance via tiered self-assessment tools. This
initiative aims to instill institutional confidence by assigning
maturity tiers (from nascent to enterprise-grade) and offering a due
diligence checklist to streamline onboarding for professional
partners. 

 PROOF-OF-GOVERNANCE AS THE ENDGAME FOR LSTS (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Proof-of-Governance is the natural conclusion of liquid staking
tokens by decoupling validator rewards from staker issuance. It allows
protocols to cut staking issuance from about 5% to 0.25% without
weakening security. With near-100% bonding and fee burning, net
issuance to token holders approaches zero, making standalone LSTs
redundant. Security derives from denying future validator fees rather
than slashing stake, and onchain PoS already functions as a
permissioned system. By shifting validator selection to offchain
governance, Celestia could simplify its economics, eliminate redundant
staking mechanics, and focus value accrual directly for TIA holders.

 5 CHARTS THAT EXPLAIN CRYPTO RIGHT NOW (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Crypto is growing across the board with mobile wallet usage up 23%
year-over-year, adjusted stablecoin volumes increasing 49%, and
institutional flows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs up 28%. DEXs now
account for 17% of spot trading volume, up from 11% last year, while
total transaction fees have dropped 43%, signaling more efficient
blockspace usage. The industry is scaling and diversifying with
wallets, payments, and tokenized assets all trending toward broader
adoption and deeper utility. 

 HOW STABLECOINS CAPTURE VALUE ACROSS THE STACK (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Stablecoins create value through a four-layer stack: issuers like
Tether sit at the base, earning billions annually from Treasury
yields, while chains like Ethereum and Tron capture fees from
stablecoin transfers. Further up the stack, DeFi infrastructure
(Curve, Aave, and Uniswap) enables swaps and yield strategies, and
B2B/B2C apps monetize stablecoin utility through payments, wallets,
and invoicing. While the top layer offers the most room for
innovation, value flows upward from the foundational layer of
issuer-controlled assets.

MISCELLANEOUS

 COINBASE IS QUIETLY TAKING ON VISA AND MASTERCARD (6 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 The GENIUS Act legalized stablecoin issuance in the U.S., prompting
Visa and Mastercard stocks to fall while Coinbase and Circle's
increased. Coinbase's new Commerce Payments Protocol introduces core
features of traditional card networks like authorization, capture,
refunds, and merchant fees into stablecoin payments powered by smart
contracts and programmable "Operators." By enabling onchain
equivalents to issuers, acquirers, and reward systems, Coinbase has
laid the groundwork for a permissionless, incentivized payments
ecosystem, one that could scale faster than expected as firms like
Shopify, Amazon, and Walmart explore stablecoin adoption. 

 THERE IS NO PVE I LOVE YOU (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Crypto discussions framing memecoin markets as “PvP” versus
“PvE” miss the point that it's asset quality, not game mechanics,
driving outcomes. Profit-taking is inherent to any tradable asset, and
issues arise only when the underlying tokens lack real value. The
memecoin cycle has industrialized issuance costs near zero, trading
strategies are streamlined, winners narrow, and liquidity concentrates
with insiders, stifling large upside moves. Nevertheless, speculative
demand persists through high-convexity bets like Binance futures and
breakout meme launches, even as the broader market shifts toward
genuinely revenue-generating protocols such as perpetuals, lending
platforms, launchpads, on-chain trading apps, and MEV infrastructure.
