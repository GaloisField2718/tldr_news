MARKETS & BUSINESS

 HOW A COLORFUL INVESTOR PROFITED FROM A CRYPTO GIANT'S DEALMAKING (9
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tether is investing its massive profits into AI and neural implant
companies with assistance from controversial tech investor Christian
Angermayer. It has already spent $1.5 billion on majority stakes in

Tether's business from stablecoins, where it earns $4 billion
annually, into new technologies, though Angermayer has a questionable
track record on past deals.

 ERIC WALL'S THOUGHTS ON THE CRYPTO MARKET (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Bitcoin is becoming increasingly attractive as a simple, gold-like
asset, even with all its flaws and areas for improvement. It staying
as the #1 asset is critically important, as it simplifies the pitch to
investors about how to choose a winning digital asset. Ethereum has
been a loser this cycle as value has been extracted by VCs, hence why
money has been flowing into memecoins. Going forward, AI will become a
bigger problem for crypto as it outcompetes in mindshare and developer
talent. 

 AI AGENTS WILL REVOLUTIONIZE DECENTRALIZED STABLECOINS (2 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Stablecoins face a trilemma around scalability, decentralization, and
stability. Payments have been Crypto's first killer app, becoming a
global payment system, especially in countries with unstable fiat
currencies. AI agents can improve scalability by dynamically minting
and redeeming. Agentic payments, where AI pays for goods on users'
behalf, are the future of payments.
