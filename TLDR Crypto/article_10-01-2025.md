 A BITCOIN L2 THESIS (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bitcoin L2s have a compelling case to address a larger market than
Ethereum L2s, primarily since they must provide scaling and
programmability while ETH L2s only focus on scaling. Since security
will be more critical and differentiated, they will capture
conservative and risk-seeking capital due to Bitcoin L1's limited
programmability. Some of the most promising Bitcoin roll ups will use
zero-knowledge technology for enhanced security and scaling.
