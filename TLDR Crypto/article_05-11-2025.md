MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTOS TUMBLE, NEARING OCTOBER CRASH LOWS (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin fell below $106,000 with altcoins declining harder, fully
reversing the bounce from the October 10 crash. The selloff liquidated
over $1 billion in leveraged positions across digital assets, while
crypto stocks fell, led by Circle (-7%), Gemini (-6%), Coinbase (-4%),
and Strategy (-3%). FundStrat's Tom Lee maintains his bullish year-end
targets of $200,000 for bitcoin and $7,000 for ether, stating
"fundamentals are leading prices in crypto, so eventually we
consolidate and then we rally into year-end." 

 NOVEMBER THE NEW OCTOBER FOR US CRYPTO ETFS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Four crypto ETFs launched this week using a procedural shortcut
requiring "no delaying amendment" language in S-1 filings that
automatically become effective after 20 days unless the SEC issues a
stay, which circumvents problems caused by the government shutdown.
Fidelity and Canary Capital filed updated S-1s on Thursday for spot
Solana and XRP ETFs, respectively, which could launch as early as
November 13 if the SEC doesn't intervene. Some filings, like XRP,
haven't received SEC feedback, unlike the reviewed Solana, HBAR, and
Litecoin applications, potentially prompting the agency to halt
automatic approval.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 LIQUID: TRADE ANYWHERE (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Liquid is a non-custodial perp DEX aggregator that combines
Hyperliquid, Lighter, and Ostium into a unified mobile-first platform
offering trading, yield vaults (~7% APY), risk management, and
analytics with push notifications for liquidation warnings. The
platform facilitated over $500 million in trading volume since
launching weeks ago, taking a small additional fee on top of trades
while providing institutional-grade infrastructure to retail users
through automated risk management and real-time market analysis.
Liquid integrates point-based reward systems for tracking
participation across projects from one interface. 

 THE EXPANDING STABLECOIN ECOSYSTEM (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Stablewatch released an updated Stablecoin Ecosystem Map,
categorizing the rapidly growing market into crypto-backed,
T-bill-backed, non-USD, and tokenized bank deposit stablecoins. The
visual highlights the diversity of issuers from Aave's GHO and Frax's
frxUSD to Circle's USDC, PayPal's PYUSD, and Hyperliquid's USDH, as
well as emerging entrants like Western Union's USDPT and MegaETH's
USD.ai.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BITCOIN'S SILENT IPO (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bitcoin's weak price action despite wildly successful ETFs,
institutional adoption, and friendly regulation mirrors traditional
IPO dynamics where early investors methodically cash out. Meta's 2012
IPO at $38/share raising $16 billion exemplifies this pattern. Shares
fell 30% over the following year as early investors distributed
positions without cratering the price, creating a "sideways grind that
drives everyone crazy." Onchain data shows old bitcoin moving as ETFs
and institutional bids finally provide liquidity that didn't exist in
2015-2019, when selling $100 million or $1 billion would crater
prices, with the distribution process typically taking 6-18 months in
traditional markets and possibly longer in crypto. 

 MATURATION OF THE CRYPTO INDUSTRY (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Blockchain infrastructure achieved 100x throughput growth over five
years, with transaction costs dropping from $24 to cents on L2s, while
Solana and Hyperliquid captured 53% of total onchain revenue as the
market crossed $4 trillion with 40-60 million active users. Stablecoin
supply reached $300 billion with USDe emerging as the third-largest,
while RWAs grew 208% to $30 billion and perp DEXs crossed $1 trillion
volume, capturing 13% market share, alongside ETPs holding $175
billion, representing 10% of all ETH and BTC. Non-financial sectors
saw DePIN projects grow 12x with 100x revenue increase across 13
million active devices, while the x402 protocol enabled AI agent
payments projected to reach $30 trillion in autonomous transaction
value by 2030, with AI crypto tokens exceeding $800 million market
cap.

 PERP DEX VOLUMES HIT RECORD $1.2T AMID INCENTIVES AND LIQUIDATIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Perpetual futures DEXs recorded a historic $1.2 trillion in trading
volume in October, nearly double September's total, driven by
incentive programs and the October 10 liquidation event. Platforms
like Lighter, Aster, EdgeX, Pacifica, and ApeX all hit new highs,
while Lighter captured a 27% market share, overtaking Hyperliquid,
which fell to 10% from 33% just a month earlier. 

 CRYPTO MARKET BLEED TIED TO US LIQUIDITY CRUNCH (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The recent crypto market downturn is occurring because of the US
government shutdown, which has lasted 35 days and frozen Treasury
spending. The Treasury General Account (TGA), the government's
operational fund at the Fed, has ballooned to $1 trillion from $700B,
effectively withholding $300B from the economy. This “dam effect”
drained banking reserves from $3.2T to $2.8T, tightening liquidity and
stressing the repo market. Relief could arrive soon. However, the Fed
plans to end quantitative tightening (QT) on December 1, redirecting
$40B/month into bank reserves and money markets via Treasury bill
rollovers. Once the shutdown ends and QT halts, liquidity should flow
back into risk assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum, historically the
most liquidity-sensitive, likely to rebound first.
