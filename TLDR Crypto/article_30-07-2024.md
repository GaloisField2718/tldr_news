 COMP DOWN 6.7% AFTER SUPPOSED 'GOVERNANCE ATTACK' ON COMPOUND DAO (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 COMP has suffered a â€˜governance attack' after a group known as the
Golden Boys passed a proposal to distribute $24 million in COMP to a
new protocol controlled by their multi-sig. They had two prior
proposals fail, but a third went through after there was insufficient
support to veto the proposal. The leader of the Golden Boys, Humpy,
previously executed a similar attack on Balancer in 2022. The Compound
forums state that Humpy will cancel the proposal in exchange for the
protocol sharing fees with COMP holders. 

 POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH SENATOR LUMMIS' BITCOIN RESERVE PROPOSAL (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Lummis' plan would see the US Treasury revalue its gold, which is
officially valued at 1/6th its market value, and a small portion of it
to purchase $64 billion worth of BTC. However, any money spent from
the Treasury General account adds as much to bank reserves, and the
Fed must pay interest on those reserves. Since BTC and gold are
non-interest bearing, additional operation expenses could prevent the
Fed from remaining self-financing.

 EVERYTHING ABOUT SOLANA'S CONSENSUS MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This detailed infographic explains the complex details of Solana's
consensus. Each 2-3 days, the leaders for each slot and the rewards
pool are determined, after which blocks are proposed every 400
milliseconds. Non-conflicting transactions are processed in parallel
and conflicting ones sequentially after being scheduled by the prio
graph scheduler. 

 USEFUL ETHEREUM DEVELOPMENT TOOLS (3 MINUTE READ) [9]

 THE SLOW DEATH OF ON-CHAIN DEFI (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This thread discusses the decline of on-chain DeFi, attributing it to
security vulnerabilities and the rise of CeDeFi protocols. Key issues
highlighted include the increased reliance on centralized off-chain
infrastructure, the trend towards centralization and control by
developers, and the dominance of powerful intermediaries or "solvers,"
which ultimately undermine the decentralized vision of DeFi by
creating centralized storefronts that prioritize user experience and
profitability over true decentralization. 

 A DEFENSE OF CRYPTO (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This argument explains why a middle-class American who believes in
the current system should support crypto. The government has been
aggressively anti-crypto and in some cases criminal, like in the Debt
Box case where the SEC was sanctioned for committing perjury.
Furthermore, the current financial system penalizes small and
medium-sized businesses by not providing adequate protections against
the risks the banks take with their money. Change to this system will
have to come from the outside, with competitive products that
challenge the status quo through low transaction costs, self-custody,
and a lower risk profile.

QUICK LINKS

 SOLANA'S CULTURE OF PURSUING GROWTH AT ALL COSTS (3 MINUTE READ) [12]


 While Solana is often criticized for its centralization and copying
of Ethereum, its culture of embracing unproven and seemingly
ridiculous app use cases has become a significant strength,
potentially outpacing Ethereum in real-world growth. 

 COMP GOVERNANCE DEEP DIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The $COMP governance drama centers around a proposal to move 5% of
the Compound treasury into a DeFi vault controlled by a group known as
the "Golden Boys," led by Humpy, known for similar tactics in other
DeFi projects. 

 BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY BUDGET ANALYSIS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 As Bitcoin issuance continues to halve, transaction fees must become
the primary source of fees, otherwise network security is at risk. 

 MAKER AIMS FOR $100BN STABLECOIN DESPITE AI DELAY (4 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Maker's Endgame plan originally was going to launch with several
AI-enabled subDAOs to make governance simpler.
