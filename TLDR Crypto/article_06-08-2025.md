 SEC SAYS LIQUID STAKING DOESN'T RUN AFOUL OF SECURITIES LAWS (6
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance clarified in a non-binding
staff statement that liquid staking, where users deposit covered
crypto assets to receive receipt tokens, does not require
securities-law disclosures as long as the assets aren't part of an
investment contract. With nearly $67 billion in TVL across protocols
like Lido, Jito, and Rocket Pool, the market saw only muted price
changes after the announcement. The guidance emphasizes that liquid
staking providers act as agents without entrepreneurial or managerial
efforts in staking decisions. By following this statement, industry
participants should avoid enforcement actions under current securities
laws.

 24 RECENT ETHEREUM ECOSYSTEM LAUNCHES (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Over the past few weeks, the Ethereum ecosystem has seen major
integrations and supply growth: Robinhood went onchain via Arbitrum,
Base launched Base Pay and its onchain app, and total stablecoin
supply across Ethereum L1/L2 topped $140 billion. Institutional
momentum accelerated with ConsenSys' “Trustware” report, Electric
Capital's ETH advocacy, a record $726.6 million single-day ETH ETF
inflow, and treasury moves by BitDigital and BitMNR. Key
infrastructure and app innovations shipped, including FocusTree's 500k
daily users on Starknet, Boundless's ZK execution layer beta,
EigenLayer's slashed-funds redistribution, and the Talos AI agent on
Arbitrum. The ecosystem also celebrated Ethereum's 10th anniversary
globally, released a new documentary, and saw expanded real-world
deployments, from Google Cloud ZK identity proofs and PayPal crypto
payments to Morpho Labs' $2 billion TVL on Base.

 BASE APP'S EARLY METRICS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Base App transforms Coinbase's wallet into a crypto “super app,”
merging self-custodial wallet functions, Farcaster-powered SocialFi
via Zora NFTs, USDC-based PayFi with 1% cashback, and integrated
mini-apps. Since rebranding in July, daily token launches surged from
4k to 15k, trading volume rose from $1M to $6M, and creator rewards
jumped to $30k/day, with over 8k Zora smart wallets now active.
Partnerships with Zora, Noice, and Clanker, along with an independent
security council and a friendlier US regulatory climate, fuel
speculation of a future $BASE token. 

 FRAXNET: THE FAT STABLECOIN THESIS (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A “Fat Stablecoin” model flips the traditional banking and
stablecoin yield capture by programmatically redistributing real-time
frxUSD yield directly to holders under GENIUS-compliant regulations.
Serving as the account layer atop L1 Fraxtal, it enables instant
minting, redemption, yield streaming, and plug-and-play integrations
without lockups or custody complexity. Targeting the $7.5 trillion
money market fund sector and broader $20 trillion U.S. M2 supply,
FraxNet eliminates daily settlement delays and intermediaries to
unlock new cash-management primitives. By aligning incentives and
offering transparent, auditable distribution, frxUSD is positioned as
a superior institutional cash infrastructure that drives mainstream
adoption.
