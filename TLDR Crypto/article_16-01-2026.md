MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CME ADDS CARDANO, CHAINLINK, AND STELLAR FUTURES TO DERIVATIVES SUITE
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 CME Group will list futures (standard and micro contracts) for
Cardano, Chainlink, and Stellar starting February 9 to broaden its
regulated crypto derivatives offering beyond Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, and
Solana. Clients are looking for trusted products to manage price risk,
even as overall crypto derivatives volumes cooled into year-end. The
move also ties into CME's longer-term push toward “always-on”
continuous trading for round-the-clock global markets. 

 GENERIC LAUNCHES GUSD: A PRIVATE, YIELD-ROUTING META-STABLECOIN (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 GUSD is the first natively private stablecoin built on Morpho. It is
a meta-stablecoin that aggregates dollar assets like USDC, USDT, and
USDS, offers opt-in privacy, is non-custodial, and routes onchain
yield back to the distribution layer (applications, networks, and end
users) rather than to an issuer. GUSD will have risk and deployment
support from Steakhouse Financial. Its early partners include
LayerZero, Aragon, Status, and Tempo.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INGENICO PARTNERS WITH WALLETCONNECT PAY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Payment terminal giant Ingenico has integrated WalletConnect Pay to
enable crypto payments at physical retail locations through its
existing POS infrastructure. The partnership allows merchants using
Ingenico terminals to accept stablecoin payments without additional
hardware or significant integration work. This marks a significant
expansion of crypto payment rails into traditional retail, leveraging
Ingenico's global network of 40M+ payment terminals. 

 CELESTIA VISION 2.0: EVERY MARKET ONCHAIN (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Celestia's Vision 2.0 pivots the data availability layer's mission
toward enabling high-volume financial markets to operate entirely
onchain. The roadmap targets blockspace products capable of supporting
trading volumes comparable to traditional exchanges, requiring 10-100x
improvements in throughput and latency. Celestia aims to become the
settlement layer for a new generation of onchain order books and
derivatives markets currently constrained by blockchain performance
limitations.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE DECENTRALIZED RENAISSANCE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The original 2014 Web3 vision of permissionless decentralized
applications is now achievable due to infrastructure maturation.
Fileverse, a decentralized Google Docs alternative, is evidence that
dApps have reached usability parity with Web2 as it passes the
“walkaway test,” where users can retrieve data even if the company
disappears. 2026 will be an inflection point where the technical
prerequisites for competing with centralized platforms are finally in
place. 

 WHY OPEN NETWORKS WIN (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 History's greatest breakthroughs came not from new inventions but
from removing friction, and open networks like blockchain represent
the next major friction reduction. Permissionless systems lower
barriers to participation and enable innovation at the edges without
gatekeepers. Crypto's value proposition isn't speculation but
fundamentally restructuring how economic coordination happens at
scale.

 INSIDE THE FIRST AUTONOMOUS AGENT ECONOMY ON SOLANA (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 t54.ai has launched what it claims is the first fully autonomous
agent economy on Solana, where AI agents independently transact,
negotiate, and allocate resources using the x402 protocol
infrastructure. Drawing lessons from Microsoft Research's Magentic
Marketplace and Stanford HAI's agent society experiments, the system
enables agents to discover services, execute payments, and form
emergent market structures without human intervention. The project
explores economic coordination between AI systems using blockchain as
the trust and settlement layer. 

 INTRODUCING $GWEI: ETHGAS GOVERNANCE TOKEN (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 $GWEI is the governance token for ETHGas' real-time Ethereum gas
optimization protocol. It enables holders to vote on fee distribution
mechanisms and protocol upgrades. The token captures value from the
platform's gas prediction and bundling services. Stakers earn a
portion of protocol fees. $GWEI is essential infrastructure for MEV
protection and transaction cost optimization.
