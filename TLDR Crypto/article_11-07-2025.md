MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN BREAKS RECORD, TOPPING $113,000 (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin surged past $113,000 for the first time, breaking out of its
months-long trading range with a 3.7% 24-hour gain. The rally has been
fueled by robust ETF inflows, ongoing corporate adoption by crypto
treasury firms, and an increasingly accommodating regulatory backdrop,
with some analysts forecasting a climb to $140,000 by year-end. The
broader market also enjoyed gains, as Ethereum rallied over 5% above
$2,800 and the CoinDesk 20 Index rose 3.4%. Together, these moves
underscore continued institutional demand and bullish momentum across
digital assets. 

 BIT MINING SHIFTS STRATEGY TO SOLANA, PLANS $300M TREASURY RAISE (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 NYSE-listed BIT Mining is pivoting from BTC to Solana, aiming to
raise $200-$300M to build a long-term SOL treasury and become a
publicly traded vehicle for Solana exposure. The firm will convert all
existing crypto holdings into SOL, run validator nodes, and pursue
deeper ecosystem involvement. This follows a broader trend of miners
like Bit Digital and BitMine rotating into Ethereum.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 MULTIPLIER: THE PEOPLE'S MARKET MAKER (60 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Multiplier transforms passive token speculation into active,
game-driven liquidity by routing capital through onchain auction games
that allocate buy pressure to curated tokens based on player outcomes.
Token teams compete for exposure via stake-based slot auctions, while
developers leverage SDKs to integrate custom gameplay on shared
liquidity pools. This creates a self-reinforcing loop of narrative
momentum, attention amplification, and sustained buy pressure that
reactivates stalling tokens beyond their initial launches. Its
modular, chain-agnostic architecture treats gamification as a core
liquidity routing primitive rather than a surface-level incentive. 

 ANT INTERNATIONAL PLANS TO ADD USDC AFTER REGULATORY GREEN LIGHT (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Jack Ma-backed Ant International plans to integrate Circle's USDC
into its AntChain network once the stablecoin clears U.S. regulatory
requirements, enabling dollar-based settlement across its $1T+
cross-border payments platform. The move would give USDC access to one
of the largest non-U.S. fintech ecosystems and position Ant to expand
regulated crypto services globally via licenses in Hong Kong,
Singapore, and Luxembourg. Circle, which recently went public,
continues to scale USDC's footprint through partnerships and a U.S.
bank license push.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT WOULD STRIPE L1 LOOK LIKE? (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Rumors suggest Stripe may launch its own L1 network, building on its
Bridge and Privy acquisitions to offer integrated stablecoin accounts
and wallet infrastructure. In the base case, this would enable
merchants to settle in USDC/USDB on Stripe L1 and provide customers
with Web3 wallets and stablecoin payment options. The bull case
imagines direct customer-merchant transfers bypassing card networks,
micro-streaming subscriptions billed by the minute, and DeFi yields on
held deposits. Such a move would recast Stripe from a payments service
provider into a full-stack financial rails operator, marking a
potential paradigm shift in global payment systems. 

 CONTROL IS A SPECTRUM (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Control exists on a spectrum defined by two axes: who holds control
(from single-party multisigs to fully immutable DAOs) and what powers
they have (from full upgradeability to mere pause functions). By
mapping a protocol's position on these axes, founders can align their
governance design with legal obligations based on who can do what.
Tailoring control to non-negotiable business needs, like emergency
pauses rather than unrestricted upgrades, balances operational
benefits against regulatory risks. This analysis framework helps teams
make intentional, legally informed decisions about decentralization
and upgrade scope.

 BITCOIN'S PRICE TAKES AIM AT $200,000 BY YEAR END (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Analysts from Bitwise, Bernstein, and Standard Chartered project
Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by year-end, driven by pro-crypto executive
actions and pending Genius and Clarity Acts that promise clearer
digital-asset regulation. With stablecoins now a $255 billion market,
onchain dollar liquidity is surging. Anticipated Federal Reserve rate
cuts and over $15.7 billion of net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs
underscore growing risk-asset demand. Meanwhile, more than 250
companies have added Bitcoin (and even altcoins) to their treasuries
in “Strategy copycat” moves, a trend set to intensify
institutional adoption into 2026. 

 SPECULATION IS DEAD, LONG LIVE SPECULATION (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Speculation has evolved from mindless casino bets to “intellectual
speculation” played out in memecoins, zero-day options, perpetual
futures, prediction markets, and collectible investing, all driven by
hypermimetic communities copying sophisticated analysis frameworks.
Empirical evidence exemplifies this trend – 0DTE options grew from
5% to 61% of S&P volume, Hyperliquid logged $1.57 trillion in annual
perp trading, and collectible and memecoin markets saw triple-digit
growth. Traders crave the illusion of skill and community validation,
signaling intelligence even as they chase high-variance outcomes.
Platforms that enable shared analytical narratives and mimetic network
effects are outpacing traditional gambling firms, proving that modern
speculation thrives under a “lab coat” of complexity.
