 üÜï RADQUEST IS OUT NOW AND PROVIDES A WEB3 ONBOARDING EXPERIENCE
ANYONE CAN CONFIDENTLY USE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Give it a try today to earn over $20 in XRD and rare NFTs whilst
getting started with Radix [4]!

Why has Radix launched RadQuest? Because Web3 has a PROBLEM. A problem
that stops 420 million users from moving assets from centralized
exchanges onto a permissionless network.

The problem is that Web3 is _SCARY, _and the onboarding sucks.

Solving Web3's scary problem requires a FULL-STACK approach, and that
is exactly what Radix provides [4]. Until now, people had to be told
why and how these issues are solved. It's time to start showing them
rather than just telling them.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC MIGHT SHELVE ALLEGATION THAT SOLANA IS A SECURITY IN BINANCE
LAWSUIT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The SEC plans to amend its lawsuit against Binance, delaying the
decision on whether cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA),
and Polygon (MATIC) are considered securities. This move temporarily
postpones a court ruling on these specific allegations but does not
dismiss them outright. 

 CIRCLE SAID TO BE TRADING AROUND $5B VALUATION AHEAD OF PLANNED IPO
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Circle, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is trading at a $5 billion
valuation in the secondary market before its upcoming IPO. It
previously attempted to go public via SPAC in 2022 at a $9 billion
valuation, but the deal fell through due to a lack of SEC approval.
The exact date of the IPO remains unknown.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 IRYS ‚Äì THE FIRST PROGRAMMABLE DATACHAIN (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Irys was initially a scaling solution for Arweave, helping it process
90% of its transactions and data. The Irys L1 chain will optimize for
storage and computation and support both onchain and temporary data.
It aims to be the primary data infrastructure protocol for the onchain
world. Irys will allow smart contracts to directly interact with
onchain data in real-time, expanding the potential of dapps and making
blockspace more useful. 

 CALIFORNIA DMV DIGITIZES 42 MILLION CAR TITLES ON AVALANCHE
BLOCKCHAIN (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 California is building a DMV-run blockchain for storing and
transferring vehicle titles built using Avalanche L1 technology.
Vehicle owners will be able to claim their digital titles in the DMV's
mobile wallet app, reducing unnecessary trips to the Post Office and
DMV and reducing transfer times from two weeks to a few minutes. It is
one of the first projects in California's vision of incorporating
blockchain into government operations.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 A CRITICAL INVESTIGATION ON SOLANA (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Despite bullish sentiments about Solana ($SOL), closer examination
reveals significant issues with the platform's transaction data,
suggesting a high level of wash trading and fraudulent activities. The
exaggerated transaction volumes, primarily driven by bots and rug
pulls on decentralized exchanges, raise concerns about the
authenticity of Solana's reported usage metrics and its long-term
sustainability. 

 HOW TO THINK ABOUT BLACKBIRD (45 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Blackbird is a loyalty and payments platform for restaurants that
aims to make hospitality and being a ‚Äúregular‚Äù a scalable
experience. It uses crypto features to enhance the user experience,
like to give network ownership to restaurants and reward users with
$FLY tokens. Blackbird drives greater loyalty and magical dining
experiences. The interconnected nature of the loyalty program means a
diner can use their $FLY rewards at any restaurant, making the token
restaurant social capital. Blackbird's 2% fee is below industry
average. Its ability to improve customer lifetime value helps make
restaurants more profitable.

MISCELLANEOUS

 UNISWAP'S COMPETITIVE POSITION ALLOWS IT TO PRICE INDIVIDUAL POOLS (1
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Uniswap shouldn't turn on its fee switch as it could hurt liquidity
providers. Instead, Uniswap could charge fees only on trading pairs
where it dominates, optimizing value capture without broadly impacting
all liquidity providers. 

 WALL ST APPRECIATING BLOCKCHAIN PROFITABILITY (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 JPMorgan's recent report highlights how Ethereum's Dencun upgrade
boosted Layer-2 chain profitability and predicts $20 million in net
fees for Base in Q2 2024. With ETH ETFs, analysts will compare
blockchain protocols like ETH and SOL to traditional businesses,
recognizing their high growth and profitability.
