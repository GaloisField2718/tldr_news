 EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TEES (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer secure, isolated
computation that complements blockchain capabilities. They have
applications in MEV, DePIN, Passkey wallets, and scaling, as they
provide privacy and computational power while maintaining onchain
verifiability via remote attestations. As the technology matures,
long-term value will likely accrue to apps utilizing TEEs, aligning
with a shift towards the ‚Äúfat-app‚Äù thesis. 

 STABLECOINS: THE EMERGING MARKET STORY (38 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stablecoins have evolved beyond crypto trading and have become
critical financial instruments in emerging markets, with over $160
billion in circulation and settling an estimated $2.6 trillion in H1
2024. This study, which combines onchain data analysis with survey
results from developing countries, reveals that stablecoins are used
for non-trading purposes like savings, currency conversion, and yield
generation. Nigerians showed the highest stablecoin affinity.

 ADAM COCHRAN ON WHY THE SEC SETTLEMENT WITH ETORO SEEMS SUPER WEIRD
(2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post critiques the SEC's settlement with eToro, highlighting the
platform's structure, which involved contracts for difference (CFD)
rather than direct crypto purchases. It argues that the SEC's press
release misrepresented the situation by focusing on token removals
instead of the actual issue ‚Äî securities based on token prices ‚Äî
and calls for greater transparency in regulatory communications.
