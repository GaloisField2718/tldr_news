MARKETS & BUSINESS

 GALAXY EXECUTES LARGEST-EVER BITCOIN SALE FOR EARLY INVESTOR (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Galaxy facilitated a historic sale of over 80K BTC worth around $9
billion on behalf of a Satoshi-era investor, marking the largest
bitcoin transaction by value to date. The sale, part of the investor's
broader estate planning strategy, signals one of the earliest and most
substantial exits from the digital asset market. 

 EX-BLACKROCK EXEC JOINS LUBIN'S ETH TREASURY COMPANY AS CO-CEO (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Joseph Chalom, previously a managing director at BlackRock, where he
spearheaded the firm's digital assets strategy and institutional
partnerships, has joined SharpLink Gaming, Inc., a major Ethereum
treasury company led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, as co-CEO.
SharpLink currently manages a $1.3 billion ETH treasury, positioning
it as one of the largest holders behind Peter Thiel-backed BitMine.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AAVE V4 INTRODUCES "RISK PREMIUMS" (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Aave V4 will replace the current one-size-fits-all borrowing rates
with "Risk Premiums," reflecting the true risk of users' collateral
and providing more accurate and fair lending terms. High-quality
collateral like ETH will have lower borrowing costs, while riskier
assets will incur higher premiums, improving market efficiency,
incentivizing stronger collateral, and enabling customized risk
management across specialized markets. 

 CROSSMINT UNVEILS UNIFIED WALLET API, SIMPLIFYING MULTI-CHAIN
TRANSFERS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Crossmint has introduced a new unified Send API that enables
developers to transfer funds across any blockchain using just one line
of code. The service removes the complexity of handling RPC
connections, AML checks, gas sponsorship, and multi-chain management,
streamlining wallet functionality for developers.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MEGAETH ECOSYSTEM: WHERE NO LIMITS EXIST (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MegaETH refactors the EVM into a real‑time L2 that targets 100k
TPS, gigagas throughput, and millisecond latency by pairing high‑RAM
sequencers, replica/prover nodes, EigenDA for data availability, dual
“mini‑block + EVM block” views, and RISC Zero–powered ZK
fraud proofs that settle disputes in about an hour. Its MegaMafia
accelerator seeded 15 native projects, while “The Fluffle”
soulbound NFT plus a $10M community raise anchors genuine contributors
and curbs mercenary farming. These dApps showcase capabilities
impossible on previous chains: sub‑second order‐book updates,
atomic funding farming, micro‑liquidations, live prediction markets,
and verifiable 3D asset streaming. 

 $ENA IS CIRCLE'S CATCH UP TRADE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A $360 million SPAC merger will rebrand TLGY as StablecoinX, using
roughly $260 million in new cash to buy $ENA on the open market and
locking another ~$60 million in tokens on its Nasdaq balance sheet,
retiring about 10% of the float. The structure creates a
MicroStrategy‑style flywheel – as ENA appreciates, StablecoinX's
NAV and share price rise, enabling cheaper follow-on equity raises
that fund yet more ENA purchases. Investors gain two avenues, direct
token exposure via exchanges such as Upbit and an equity proxy once
“USDE” lists, while Korean retail, already driving Circle's
post‑IPO surge, is positioned as an early demand hub. The immediate
buyback plus public‑company visibility introduces a lasting demand
shock for ENA and amplifies its role as a high‑beta stablecoin play
relative to Circle and Tether.

 THE FUTURE OF AIRDROPS & TOKEN DISTRIBUTION (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Airdrops alone no longer guarantee effective community ownership.
Post‑2024 cycles revealed weak buy‑side liquidity, faster
sell‑offs, and costly middlemen, pushing teams toward
demand‑driven, data‑rich ICOs alongside narrower airdrops. The
emerging best practice rewards “incentivized alignment” while
still tracking “unincentivized signaling” such as organic usage
spikes or surprise‑season engagement. Robust analytics are essential
– projects must mine on‑ and off‑chain behavior to allocate
supply to high‑conviction contributors and predict future
value‑add, resetting expectations for both teams and investors. 

 WHAT THE F*CK HAPPENED TO CRYPTO X AI? (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The late‑2024 AI‑token frenzy fizzled because ~95 % of
“agent” coins and resource networks were speculative vaporware.
Most now show abandoned roadmaps, single‑digit TVL, or sub‑$5M
caps despite a $10B sector headline. Yet, a latent bid for AI exposure
persists, and a handful of private teams are building real, net‑new
products that crypto alone can unlock, including synthetic
GPU‑backed stables, incentive‑driven data networks, and onchain
model access. The next wave must ditch lazy tokenization and instead
fuse crypto primitives only where they add irreplaceable value while
meeting mainstream users on familiar fronts.

 A BRIEF THOUGHT ON DATS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 As demand has flipped to oversupply, a wave of unlocks between
September and November should crush NAV premiums, and most late
entrants will be hit hard as floats explode from 2% to 95%. 

 DKING IS REBRANDING TO SIRE (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 DKING is rebranding to SIRE to sidestep potential trademark
liabilities, converting all tokens 1:1 and introducing a SIRE/USDC
liquidity pool on Aerodrome alongside a lower trading tax.

direct investment from Build and Build Corp, to significantly increase
its Binance Coin (BNB) holdings, potentially becoming one of the
