INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 MALLORY CHAT: FEEL THE MAGIC OF X402 (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mallory is an open-source AI chat app that natively consumes x402
payment APIs, starting with 19 Nansen APIs priced at $0.001 per call
to access onchain data. The mobile-native, crypto-native, and
AI-native app serves as a batteries-included foundation for developers
to build consumer applications on internet capital market rails. The
API catalog will expand to focus on Solana ecosystem capabilities. 

 CIRCLE LAUNCHES ARC PUBLIC TESTNET (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Circle has launched the public testnet for Arc, an open Layer 1
blockchain designed to serve as the Economic Operating System (OS) for
the internet. It enables stablecoin payments, tokenized assets, and
real-world financial activity to move onchain. The network already
includes early participation from global banks, asset managers, and
fintechs such as BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Visa, and
Mastercard, alongside developers and protocols like Aave, Uniswap,
Curve, Chainlink, and LayerZero. Arc will use USDC as native gas,
offer sub-second finality via its Malachite consensus engine, and
integrate Circle's full platform for liquidity, payments, and
cross-chain interoperability.

 UNWRAPPING DEFI: THE EVOLUTION OF TOKENS, POOLS, AND VAULTS (25
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 DeFi has evolved through three phases – tokens, pools, and vaults
– condensing centuries of traditional finance into more efficient
onchain protocols where users capture yields traditionally reserved
for banks and intermediaries. Stablecoins have progressed from
fiat-backed to over-collateralized to delta-neutral models like
Ethena's USDe at 101% collateralization with $12 billion market cap,
demonstrating successful token flywheels where wrapper tokens stack
yields across multiple protocols (USDe → sUSDe → PT-sUSDe →
vault positions). Six pool types emerged sequentially – lending,
trading, staking, incentivized gauges, strategy vaults, and structured
finance – with modern vaults now managing strategies across these
pools while curators take performance fees. 

 THE NEXT WAVE OF STABLECOIN ECONOMICS BELONGS TO DEFI (20 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Circle and Tether's 85% market share of the $265 billion stablecoin
market is eroding as distribution partners and ecosystems internalize
yield, evidenced by Circle paying Coinbase $908 million of its $1.7
billion in 2024 reserve income while Hyperliquid's $5.5 billion USDC
balance generated $220 million annually for Circle/Coinbase before
switching to Native Markets' USDH. Major chains leak roughly $1.1
billion in annualized stablecoin yield to Circle and Tether – 40%
more than the $800 million in transaction fees these ecosystems earn.
White-label stablecoin models via Ethena's SaaS infrastructure are
scaling across Sui, MegaETH, and Jupiter, while applications like
Hyperliquid and Pump.fun trade at 19x and 2x market cap to revenue
respectively versus Solana's 80x multiple, demonstrating how apps with
strong distribution are capturing actual cash flows at far lower
valuations than infrastructure layers.

 METAMASK FUELS AIRDROP BUZZ (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 MetaMask registered "claim.metamask.io" and "gift.metamask.io"
domains, briefly pushing Polymarket odds of a 2025 MASK token launch
from 11% to over 40% before settling back to 17%. The potential
airdrop to MetaMask's 30 million users could become one of crypto's
largest by reach, with analysts suggesting timing aligns with
Consensys's recent launches (LINEA and SBET) and strategic need to
counter wallet competition from embedded UX models like Phantom and
Rabby. Consensys founder Joseph Lubin first teased $MASK in 2021 and
confirmed in August that it's in development. The token could
potentially serve to align governance and rewards across Consensys's
product suite. 

 STATUE OF BINANCE FOUNDER COMING TO WASHINGTON DC (6 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Anonymous donors unveiled a 14-foot gold statue of Binance founder
Changpeng Zhao in Washington DC on Tuesday, depicting his iconic
four-finger anti-FUD gesture, weeks after President Trump pardoned him
from money laundering charges tied to a $4.3 billion settlement. The
$50,000 statue will be displayed outside the US Capitol before being
offered to Zhao or auctioned to benefit his nonprofit Giggle Academy.
