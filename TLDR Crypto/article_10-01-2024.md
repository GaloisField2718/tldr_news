 SEC‚ÄôS X ACCOUNT COMPROMISED TO POST FAKE SPOT BITCOIN ETF APPROVAL
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Securities and Exchange Commission's Twitter account was hacked,
resulting in a false announcement about the approval of spot Bitcoin
ETF. SEC Chair Gary Gensler confirmed the account was compromised and
the tweet was unauthorized. This was one of the most high-profile
examples of an X account being compromised in relation to
cryptocurrency. Despite the fake approval, it is widely expected that
spot bitcoin ETFs will be approved today, with trading to begin
tomorrow. 

 BITCOIN FUTURES OPEN INTEREST ON CME HITS ALL-TIME HIGH (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The open interest in Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) has hit a record high of $5.4 billion, surpassing the
previous all-time high of $4.5 billion set in November 2021,
indicating a significant increase in institutional investor
participation. This surge in futures trading, coupled with high open
interest from both asset managers and hedge funds, suggests heightened
market activity and anticipation of potential Bitcoin ETF approvals.

 THE DEFI DEGEN‚ÄôS PLAYBOOK FOR STACKS (3 MINUTE READ) [9]

thread analyzes opportunities for Stacks, making the prediction that
Stacks will likely be a major player in BTCfi. It also provides

 AIRDROP PLAYBOOK FOR RESTAKING PROTOCOLS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A playbook for landing airdrops for top restaking protocols EtherFi,
Kelp, and Renzo. It may be better to spread wallets across several
projects as often the rules for airdrop eligibility favor smaller
capitals. Always prefer to deposit slightly more than a round number,
for example, deposit 1.1 ETH instead of 1 ETH. Readers should be aware
that gas fees may sometimes be excessive as the airdrops are on the
Ethereum network.
