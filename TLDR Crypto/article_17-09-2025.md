 HOW 433 INVESTORS UNLOCKED 400X RETURN POTENTIAL (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Institutional investors back startups for outsized returns. Regular
investors have to wait. But not anymore. Thanks to regulatory updates,
some companies are doing things differently. [4]

Take Revolut. In 2016, 433 regular people invested an average of
$2,730. Today? They got a 400X buyout offer from the company, as
Revolut's valuation increased 89,900%.

No wonder 12K+ regular people are taking the chance on Pacaso. [4]

Founded by a former Zillow exec, Pacaso's co-ownership tech reshapes a
$1.3T market. They've earned $110M+ in gross profit to date. They even
reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO.

The same investors that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay also backed
Pacaso. And you can join them. But only until tomorrow. Invest before
this opportunity ends. [4]

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SOLANA TREASURY FIRM HELIUS RAISES $500M, STOCK SOARS 200% (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Helius Medical Technologies has raised over $500 million in a private
financing round led by Pantera Capital and Summer Capital to create a
Solana-focused treasury company. Shares surged over 200% above $24 in
pre-market trading following the announcement. The vehicle will hold
SOL as its reserve asset and aims to expand to more than $1.25 billion
through stock warrants. It will directly compete with recently
launched Forward Industries, which has already purchased 6.8 million
SOL tokens for roughly $1.58 billion last week from its $1.65 billion
war chest backed by Galaxy Digital. Helius plans to leverage Solana's
yield-bearing design to generate income through staking rewards of
around 7% and DeFi lending opportunities. Incoming executive chairman
Joseph Chee will lead the digital asset strategy alongside Pantera's
Cosmo Jiang and Dan Morehead. 

 DOGECOIN ETF TO LAUNCH THIS WEEK (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Rex Shares-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) could debut Thursday,
potentially becoming the first US ETF centered on a memecoin. There
have been multiple delays. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and
James Seyffart say Thursday is the most likely launch date, although
they have cautioned that nothing is certain. DOJE will offer
futures-based exposure to DOGE via a Cayman subsidiary rather than
direct token ownership, structured more like a mutual fund under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 rather than the Securities Act
framework used for bitcoin ETFs. Several firms have already filed
applications for spot DOGE ETFs that would hold the actual token,
currently under SEC review. DOGE has outperformed over the past month
with 15% gains ahead of the potential ETF debut.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE AND COINBASE BRINGING STABLECOINS TO AI AGENTS VIA X402 (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has launched an open-source protocol that enables AI agents to
send and receive payments, including stablecoins, through partnerships
with Coinbase, the Ethereum Foundation, and over 60 organizations,
including Salesforce, American Express, and Etsy. The initiative
builds on Google's April protocol for standardizing agent-to-agent
communication, now extending into financial transactions to ensure
payments are secure, interoperable, and executed with human user
intent as AI agents potentially handle complex tasks like negotiating
mortgages or shopping autonomously. Coinbase contributed x402 – its
AI-integrated payments standard – to the collaboration. The broader
partnership aims to cover both crypto and traditional finance use
cases across the ecosystem. 

 BASE ANNOUNCES NEW BRIDGE BETWEEN BASE AND SOLANA BRIDGE (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Base is launching a bridge to Solana, enabling seamless interaction
across both ecosystems. The bridge will allow users to deposit and use
SOL in Base apps, import Solana SPL tokens into Base, and export
Base-created tokens back to Solana. This marks a major step toward
cross-chain interoperability, expanding developer and user access to
liquidity and applications across two of crypto's most active
ecosystems.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WALL STREET NEEDS ETHEREUM (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Global finance is at an inflection point as legacy infrastructure
(designed for paper and T+2 settlement) is too slow, costly, and
fragmented for a 24/7 digital economy. Ethereum is the inevitable
foundation for institutional adoption, already securing ~$1T in assets
and hosting 80% of tokenized RWAs. With frameworks like the GENIUS
Act, CLARITY Act, and MiCA, regulation is aligning globally, and
institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, Apollo, and JPMorgan are
already in production on Ethereum. The window for strategic
positioning is closing fast. Those who adopt Ethereum today can shape
standards, capture liquidity, and build competitive advantage, while
late movers risk permanent disadvantage. 

 A16Z ON NETWORK TOKENS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Network tokens derive their value from the functioning of blockchains
and smart contract protocols. These tokens often embed economic
mechanisms like buybacks, burns, or dividends, and can bootstrap new
networks while decentralizing control. Under frameworks like the SEC's
2019 guidance and FIT21, tokens like BTC, ETH, SOL, and UNI may avoid
securities classification when decentralization ensures systems
operate without human control.

 THE STATE OF ONCHAIN YIELD (30 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Galaxy Digital shared a comprehensive framework for evaluating
onchain yield opportunities across five core engines: policy rate
pass-through in tokenized cash, protocol rewards from staking and
restaking, credit spreads in pooled lending, market microstructure
fees from automated market makers, and structured wrappers that
package or leverage these flows. The analysis progresses from
zero-yield stablecoins like USDT (where Tether has earned
approximately $12.6 billion in interest income over three years
without passing any to holders) through increasingly complex
strategies, including staked stablecoins, native staking, liquid
restaking, lending markets, and activity-generated yield from
liquidity provision. Galaxy's risk-adjusted efficiency analysis
reveals that cash-like instruments score highest on return per unit of
risk and complexity, with tokenized cash and fixed-income products
like Pendle PT retaining strong efficiency, while active AMM liquidity
provision shows the lowest efficiency due to path dependence and
inventory effects. Every headline yield number should be evaluated
through two critical lenses: what you earn for the risk taken, and
what remains after accounting for the operational complexity involved.


 FINANCIALIZATION OF PRIVATE EQUITY (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Private equity represents the last major financial sector to undergo
financialization, with current secondary markets suffering from heavy
illiquidity, outdated orderbook technology from the 1600s, and
premium-heavy structures requiring 10% broker fees. Street aims to
introduce spot prices, futures, hedging, options, and money markets
into private equity, addressing the five dimensions of liquidity:
tightness, depth, immediacy, breadth, and resiliency that directly
impact investor costs and capital issuer pricing. Research shows
investors demand higher returns for illiquid securities, with the
illiquidity premium representing compensation for execution,
inventory, and funding risks that compound during market stress, as
demonstrated during events like the March 2020 "dash for cash" when
even Treasury liquidity evaporated. Street's approach builds on
regulatory frameworks established since the 1933 Act, including recent
expansions through Regulation Crowdfunding and Regulation A that have
enabled $1.3 billion in retail fundraising despite wealth screens that
limit private placement access to approximately 12-13% of US
households with qualifying net worth thresholds.
