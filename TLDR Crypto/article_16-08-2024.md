 HOW TO NUKE $9 BILLION ‚Äì WBTC (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The recent announcement of BitGo's partnership with Justin Sun-backed
BiT Global, which gives the firm control over 2 of 3 WBTC private
keys, has sparked panic in the crypto community due to Sun's
controversial history. Concerns about increased custody risk and

 NORTH KOREAN DEVS INFILTRATING CRYPTO PROJECTS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A crypto team unknowingly hired North Korean IT workers with fake
identities, resulting in a $1.3M theft from their treasury. An
investigation uncovered 25+ projects employing related developers.

laundered the funds and are earning up to $500K monthly across
multiple projects. 

 IS EIGENLAYER'S ECONOMIC MODEL BROKEN? (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 EigenLayer's economic model is fundamentally flawed, particularly in
how it bootstraps new decentralized infrastructure protocols. It
effectively requires AVSs to forfeit token utility and revenue to
restakers, hurting a protocol's ability to grow and sustain an
ecosystem. Its pivot towards supporting AVS tokens as restaked assets
is an acknowledgment of its ‚Äúbroken‚Äù core economic model.
EigenLayer will likely remain a subsidized yield farm for ETH stakers.
