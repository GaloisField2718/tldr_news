 BITCOIN SPOT ETF NET INFLOWS NOW TOTAL OVER $4 BILLION SINCE LAUNCH
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Net inflows to the newly launched spot bitcoin ETFs have reached over
$4 billion in the first month since their launch, far surpassing
bitcoin issuance rates from mining. This buy pressure has tipped
Bitcoin past the $50k mark. The bitcoin halving, just three months
away, is set to reduce bitcoin's inflation to 1%. Current investment
trends are yielding a daily ETF inflow 4.6 times higher than average
bitcoin issuance post-halving, creating even greater buy pressure on
the asset.

challenges concerning digital finance in the next five years. An
informal document suggests that the EU is aiming to be at the global

 STARKWARE CEO DISMISSES STARKNET AIRDROP, TOKEN UNLOCKS CONTROVERSY:
'WE BUILD DIFFERENT' (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Starkware CEO Eli Ben-Sasson defended the firm's decision to allow
investors and contributors to sell off their STRK tokens less than two
months after launch, contrary to typical airdrop rules that enforce a
one-year lock-up period. Despite concerns of instability and potential
lawsuits, Ben-Sasson affirms faith in his team's commitment to the
project, declaring the structure representative of Starkware's
unconventional approach. He views the shorter lock period as a
deserved reward for core contributors' efforts.
