ai16z's Eliza, and Virtuals Protocol - and analyzes their unique

farming meta. Fluid is an innovative DEX with high capital efficiency
and LP APRs. Lombard is liquid-staked Bitcoin from Babylon, the

 STABLECOIN PAYMENTS: WHO ACTUALLY WINS? (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The stablecoin payments ecosystem is segmented into seven distinct
categories, with settlement rails and stablecoin issuers best poised
to capture value through network effects and infrastructure
development. While established issuers benefit from high interest
rates, they must evolve to focus on infrastructure, compliance, and
liquidity to maintain their competitive advantage. Value
transfer/money service providers with proprietary infrastructure and
direct banking relationships will likely form regional oligopolies,
while API aggregators and consumer-focused stablecoin apps face
increasing pressure from established fintech players and the
commoditization of their services. 

 69+ PROJECTS TO BUILD FOR THE RISE OF AI AGENTS (42 MINUTE READ) [12]


 In preparation for Gaia's Autonomous Agents Hackathon, founder Matt
Wright compiled a list of the best use cases to build today. The ideas
span from financial services and social interactions to enterprise
solutions and developer infrastructure, all built on decentralized
technologies. The integration of AI agents requires new infrastructure
for identity, reputation, and governance, along with systems for
autonomous financial transactions and data management through
blockchain technology. Key developments focus on agent deployment
frameworks, decentralized knowledge systems, and token-based
economics, with particular emphasis on enterprise adoption through
solutions that protect proprietary data while enabling AI monetization
and cross-organizational collaboration.
