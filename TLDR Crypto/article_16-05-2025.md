MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE CUSTOMER DATA ACQUIRED BY CRIMINALS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Coinbase disclosed that attackers bribed its overseas customer
service agents to steal a small amount of active users' personal data
and demanded a $20 million bitcoin ransom to keep the information
private. CEO Brian Armstrong warned this data enables targeted social
engineering scams against users and confirmed the company has fired
the implicated staff. In an SEC filing, Coinbase estimated remediation
and voluntary reimbursement costs to be between $180 million and
$400 million and pledged to cover any customer losses. Rather than
pay, the exchange has refused the demand, offered a $20 million
bounty for tips leading to arrests, and stepped up fraud prevention
measures. 

 ETHEREUM STABLECOIN VOLUME HITS RECORD $908B (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ethereum-based stablecoins saw a record $908 billion in transaction
volume last month driven by rising institutional adoption, tech giant
integration, and increased political engagement with crypto. Analysts
attribute the surge to major fintech and payment players expanding
support for stablecoins on Ethereum, alongside high-profile political
endorsements that have reframed digital assets as a campaign issue.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE LAUNCHING CBXRP, CBDOGE, CBADA, AND CBLTC (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Coinbase is launching four new wrapped assets on Base (cbXRP, cbDOGE,
cbADA, and cbLTC), each backed 1:1 with underlying assets custodied by
Coinbase and redeemable on demand. Moonwell plans to integrate these
tokens into lending markets, tapping into billions in idle capital
across retail and institutional holders. The tokens have yet to be
released, and no launch date has been specified. 

 INTRODUCING MULTIVERSE FINANCE (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Multiverse Finance has proposed partitioning the financial system
into parallel “verses” tied to event outcomes, allowing users to
collateralize and borrow conditional tokens (e.g., notFiredUSD vs.
notFiredETH) without liquidation risk by pushing and pulling ownership
across these verses. The framework uses a “multiverse map”
primitive to track balances per verse and supports splitting and
combining operations that mirror prediction market minting and
redemption. Upon resolution via an oracle, all but the realized verse
evaporate, enabling seamless withdrawal or settlement. This design
promises fully composable, multiverse‑aware DeFi applications and
generates predictive information about real‑world events as a
valuable byproduct.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BEST BITCOIN YIELD OPPORTUNITIES (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bitcoin yield opportunities range from 4% to over 20% APR across
diverse DeFi strategies with varying risk levels. Liquidity-mining
opportunities, such as Solv Protocol with Infrared Finance or
Velodrome offer stable rewards for BTC liquidity. Funding rate
arbitrage and looping primitives like Euler's farming on cbBTC/LBTC or
Pendle-powered Morpho loops unlock higher yields via leveraged
positioning. Cash/spend tools and simple leverage platforms, including
EtherFi's Cash Card and Fluid's smart collateral loops, round out a
spectrum of capital-efficient, composable yield options. 

 ARE WE READY FOR 100 MILLION ONCHAIN USERS? (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The onchain user experience remains fragmented and friction-filled.
48% have multiple wallets, transactions require an average of five
approvals and three gas fees, and despite 54% having used crypto for
payments, only 12% call it their favorite use case. While 69% of users
report feeling safe onchain, 21% have been phished in the past year.
Chains continue to specialize, with Ethereum for settlements, Solana
for speed, Base for experimentation, and BNB for exchange-centric
services. To onboard the next 100 million users, chain complexity must
be abstracted, and security measures must be improved. There should be
user interfaces for novice and professional users.

 CRYPTO PUNKS ACQUIRED BY NODE FOUNDATION (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Infinite Node Foundation has acquired CryptoPunks IP from Yuga
Labs, placing the pixel-art collection in a mission-driven nonprofit
endowment to safeguard its long-term cultural legacy. NODE will pursue
preservation of blockchain integrity, foster a community ecosystem,
and expand contexts for study and exhibition under a networked
stewardship model. It plans to create a permanent Palo Alto hub with a
full Ethereum node and a debut exhibition of all 10,000 Punks to
integrate this pioneering digital art into broader art-historical
discourse. 

 MOONPAY AND MASTERCARD PARTNERSHIP (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MoonPay and Mastercard have partnered to let every crypto wallet
issue virtual Mastercards that draw directly from stablecoin balances,
enabling payments at over 150 million merchants worldwide. This
integration significantly expands stablecoin utility in real‑world
transactions and aligns with Mastercard's end‑to‑end stablecoin
capabilities. It follows similar crypto‑card rollouts with OKX and
Kraken, highlighting the payments giant's deepening engagement in
digital asset flows.
