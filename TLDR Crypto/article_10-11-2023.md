 BITCOIN STAGES (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This timeless thread discusses the four stages of price momentum in
Bitcoin‚Äôs cycles. There's an accumulation range (no media/max
opportunity), directional trend (where trading tends to be most
profitable), huge volatility (media frenzy/minimal opportunity), and
the final markdown/crash. Too much activity in stages 1, 3, and 4 can
lead to significant losses. Traders should focus on directional trends
in stage 2 to maximize profits. 

 SEARCHER-BUILDER RELATIONSHIP DASHBOARD (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Bitwise Invest has launched a new public transparency dashboard to
identify vertically integrated searcher-builders, like Wintermute,
rsync, and others. The investigation was triggered by a curiosity to
identify such builders and to examine their likelihood of censoring
transactions. The finding reveals no significant correlation, meaning
that censorship pressures are common among both integrated and
non-integrated builders.

 BEYOND ZERO-KNOWLEDGE: WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT IN PROGRAMMABLE CRYPTOGRAPHY?
(12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The future of cryptography may involve programmable solutions that
allow for greater flexibility and accessibility for developers. This
includes methods like Multi-Party Computation, Fully Homomorphic
Encryption, and Indistinguishable Obfuscation. Unlike traditional
cryptography, programmable solutions could adapt to nearly any
functionality. These techniques might be more theoretical at present,
but as they become more practical, they could greatly expand the
applications and scope of cryptography, including in the realm of
artificial intelligence.
