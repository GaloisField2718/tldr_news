 ETHEREUM NEEDS TO DREAM BIGGER (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum has lost its ambitious vision amid development challenges
and competing blockchains. It needs to return to its original goal of
being a global compute platform for solving coordination problems.
There are four major technical objectives for the next five years:
implement 1-second block times, achieve single-slot finality, increase
throughput beyond 1,000 TPS, and introduce multiple concurrent
proposers (MCP). MCP could enable real-time censorship resistance and
align Ethereum's market microstructure with its vision of credible
neutrality. High fees and centralized block proposition are limiting
Ethereum's potential.
