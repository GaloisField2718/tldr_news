 BLACKROCK FILES FOR BITCOIN PREMIUM INCOME ETF (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 BlackRock has filed with the SEC to launch the iShares Bitcoin
Premium Income ETF, which would use a covered call strategy to
generate income by selling call options on bitcoin exposure managed
through the firm's existing iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), trading
potential upside for premium distributions to investors. The filing
follows similar existing crypto income products, including Roundhill's
YBTC, Amplify's BAGY, and NEOS's BTCI, though BlackRock's entry stands
out due to IBIT's dominance as the largest spot bitcoin ETF with over
$69.7 billion in assets and the firm's $12.5 trillion in total assets
under management. Covered call bitcoin ETFs have historically
underperformed BTC spot returns, which is typical by design given the
higher yields offered, with BTCI down 31.3%, YBTC down 45%, and BAGY
down 25% over relevant periods compared to bitcoin's 14% drawdown over
the past 12 months. 

 JAPAN DEFINES WHICH BONDS CAN BACK YEN STABLECOINS (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Japan's Financial Services Agency opened a public consultation
(running to February 27) on draft rules under the 2025 Payment
Services Act that would restrict eligible reserve assets for regulated
yen-pegged stablecoins to certain foreign bonds meeting two strict
tests. One is a high credit rating (risk category 1-2 or above) and an
issuer outstanding amount of at least ¥100 trillion. This is all
while adding supervisory guidance for banks and subsidiaries,
requiring foreign issuers to pledge not to solicit Japanese retail
users, and setting the reserve-composition standards that will govern
all trust-based yen stablecoins.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 TETHER LAUNCHES USA₮: FEDERALLY REGULATED US DOLLAR STABLECOIN (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tether's USA₮ is a US-focused, dollar-backed stablecoin issued by
Anchorage Digital Bank, NA. It is designed to operate within the
GENIUS Act's federal stablecoin framework with Cantor Fitzgerald as
reserve custodian. Initial distribution will be on Bybit, Crypto.com,
Kraken, OKX, and Moonpay. The stablecoin is a bank-grade,
institution-oriented digital dollar that sits alongside Tether's
global USD₮. 

 WHY POLARIS? THE STABLECOIN WE NEEDED TO BUILD (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Polaris counters stablecoin centralization by replacing RWA
dependencies with an immutable, counterparty-free architecture. While
MakerDAO and Ethena pivoted to T-bills, Polaris utilizes bonding
curves and a three-token system (pUSD, pETH, and POLAR) to generate
native yield from volatility, ensuring permanent decentralization
through code-enforced stewardship.

 WHAT MAPLE FINANCE TELLS US ABOUT ONCHAIN ASSET MANAGEMENT (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Maple Finance has originated over $17B in cumulative loans and now
manages $4.2B in AUM across stablecoin credit products, demonstrating
institutional-grade private credit infrastructure operating onchain.
The protocol has generated $128M in interest for LPs and $14M in
protocol revenue through usage-driven activity rather than token
incentives, with utilization rates ranging from 55-93% across
different products. Stablecoin-denominated pools have scaled faster
than other onchain credit models by combining traditional underwriting
with composability and automated settlement. 

 INTERESTING THINGS IN DEFI (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Yield Basis launched hybrid vaults requiring crvUSD deposits followed
by 2.5x BTC to address crvUSD demand and scale yb-BTC. Pendle is
introducing NVIDIA funding rate markets on Hyperliquid perps (the
first tradfi-style instrument for funding rate speculation) while
transitioning from veToken to liquid staking sPENDLE with 14-day
unstaking, 80% revenue buybacks, 30% emission cuts, and 4x boosts for
current lockers. USD3's sUSD3 is offering 25% APR with PT markets
anticipated for looping strategies, while Pear Protocol V2.1 adds
cross-asset conditional orders enabling executions based on BTC price
thresholds or dominance levels.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HYPERLIQUID SPOT MARKETS (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Hyperliquid's spot market model – designed to avoid predatory CEX
practices like 200k+ listing fees, forced token allocations, and
manipulated launch prices – initially struggled to sustain volume
and price action across nearly all listings. The recent performance of
Kinetiq, a token from the team behind kHYPE that's airdropped to TVL
farmers, may signal an inflection point proving the ecosystem can
support sustainable spot bids. KNTQ's recovery demonstrates that
Hyperliquid-native projects with revenue generation and genuine
utility can attract consistent buying pressure, validating the
platform's alternative listing approach. 

 QUANTUM COMPUTING AND BLOCKCHAINS (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While post-quantum encryption requires immediate deployment due to
harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks already underway, blockchains face
less urgent timelines for post-quantum signatures since they aren't
vulnerable to HNDL and cryptographically relevant quantum computers
remain 10+ years away. Most public blockchains like Bitcoin and
Ethereum use signatures rather than encryption and thus aren't exposed
to current HNDL risks, though privacy chains that encrypt transaction
details face immediate vulnerability. Bitcoin presents unique
challenges, including slow governance processes and hundreds of
billions in abandoned quantum-vulnerable coins, but blockchains should
prioritize implementation security over quantum threats in the near
term while beginning migration planning.
