 LITHIUM DEMAND'S FUELING A MODERN-DAY GOLD RUSH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Essential for EVs, robots, data centers and AI, Elon Musk said it
best: “Do you like minting money? Well, the lithium business is for
you.”

Enter EnergyX [4]. Their tech can recover up to 3X more lithium than
traditional methods. They've got a strategic investment from General
Motors, raised nearly $150M, and recently earned a $5M DoE grant. Now,
they're preparing to commercially unlock up to 9.8M tons of Chilean
lithium. Join them as an early-stage investor before EnergyX's share
price increases from $11 after February 26. [4]

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 STABLECOINS COULD CREATE $1T IN NEW T-BILL DEMAND BY 2028 (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Standard Chartered projects stablecoin market cap could reach $2
trillion by 2028, generating $0.8 to $1 trillion in incremental demand
for short-term US Treasury bills as regulated issuers accumulate
high-quality liquid assets under frameworks like the GENIUS Act. If
realized, that demand could allow the US Treasury to shift issuance
toward bills and potentially suspend 30-year bond auctions for up to
three years. 

 WHY TRADFI IS BUYING DEFI TOKENS (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 BlackRock, Citadel Securities, and Apollo Global Management disclosed
DeFi token purchases, with BlackRock buying UNI, Citadel acquiring ZRO
tokens, and Apollo entering a 48-month agreement to acquire up to 90
million MORPHO tokens representing 9% of supply. Investors broadly
characterize these moves as "vendor alignment, not portfolio
allocation" as firms tokenizing products need DeFi venues for
distribution, facilitated by regulatory tailwinds including SAB 121
repeal, SEC dropping investigations into Uniswap and Aave, GENIUS Act
passage, and the four-tier token taxonomy signaling most governance
tokens aren't securities. Token prices remained muted despite the
announcements as sophisticated holders await actual economics showing
up in protocols, with the DeFi token disconnect from strong
fundamentals persisting due to historical lack of revenue capture, VC
unlock sell pressure, and L1/L2 fragmentation. Investors identify fee
switches, tapering unlocks, CLARITY Act passage, and potential DeFi
ETF approvals from Grayscale and Bitwise as catalysts needed before
governance tokens function meaningfully like strategic equity with
enforceable shareholder-style rights.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 HOW DECENTRALIZED AI IS LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD (7 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 There is a clear opportunity when comparing the $12 trillion
centralized AI enterprise valuation versus the $12 billion
decentralized AI market cap, with the blockchain AI market projected
to grow from $6 billion to $50 billion by 2030 at 42.4% CAGR, as
agentic AI demands truly autonomous, privacy-preserving architecture
that centralized platforms structurally cannot provide. Decentralized
AI unlocks enterprise data vaults sealed from centralized LLMs due to
competitive, regulatory, and fiduciary concerns, enabling
pharmaceutical research, medical imaging, and financial data to safely
contribute to model training through cryptographic verification of
data sovereignty rather than vendor trust promises. Platforms like
Bittensor, Akash, and Venice.AI aggregate idle distributed GPU
capacity to deliver lower-cost inference that reportedly outperforms
centralized benchmarks while open-source collaborative models enable
faster iteration than proprietary systems locked behind Big Tech
walls. 

 ETHER.FI IS MIGRATING TO OPTIMISM (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ether.fi is migrating from Scroll to OP Mainnet, bringing 300,000+
accounts and $160M+ TVL at a critical moment as Base's potential exit
from the Superchain threatens to eliminate 94% of Optimism's ecosystem
revenue. The crypto neobank, which represents 83% of Scroll's total
TVL and processes $1-2M in daily spending volume across ~23,000
transactions, would increase OP Mainnet's DeFi TVL by 75% and become
its largest dApp at 3x Aave's current $56.3M. The migration
underscores an emerging thesis that crypto neobanks have become
essential infrastructure for L2s, as single applications in this
category can simultaneously drive TVL growth, transaction volume,
real-world utility, and user acquisition.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE MARKET IS DEAD, BUT DRAGONFLY JUST RAISED $650M. WHY? (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Dragonfly raised $650M for its fourth fund targeting stablecoins,
DeFi, RWAs, prediction markets, and infrastructure as 2025 crypto
funding hit $25B – a 160% increase from 2024 – with average deal
sizes tripling to $31.5M and 46 deals exceeding $100M versus just 12
the prior year. Payments funding surged 424% to $1.88B and RWA funding
skyrocketed 802% to $1.1B, and Polymarket and Kalshi capturing
mega-rounds while retail AI agent hype failed to attract institutional
capital. VCs pivoted from early-stage infrastructure bets to mature,
revenue-generating applications with clear exit paths through IPOs
(Circle, BitGo) and strategic acquisitions (Robinhood, Stripe),
signaling a "quality over quantity" consolidation phase focused on
real financial use cases over speculative innovation. 

 $AERO THESIS: BASE'S CASH COW (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Aerodrome generates $85-98M annually in organic swap fees with 100%
flowing to veAERO lockers, trading at 4-5x dilution-adjusted P/E on
trough volume with 1.6-1.9x upside to 2025 average Base DEX volumes at
current $0.30 price. Coinbase's involvement extends beyond its $20M
market buy (reportedly Coinbase Ventures' largest liquid token
investment) to active governance, cbBTC liquidity steering, and
Coinbase One feeless trading integration. The thesis hinges on Base's
announced migration from OP Stack to a unified stack, with a potential
$BASE token launch representing the largest volume catalyst, though
bull case projections of 3-4x at ATH volumes face structural headwinds
from AERO-denominated emissions that scale linearly with price.

 THE US IS GOING ALL IN ON TOKENIZED ASSETS (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The US has strong economic incentives to push tokenized dollars and
tokenized securities, as global onchain access could expand the buyer
base for Treasuries and equities, lower government borrowing costs,
raise corporate valuations, and reinforce dollar dominance. This would
create macro tailwinds for stablecoin issuers and RWA-focused
blockchains as a global tokenization race accelerates. 

 SEC CHAIR PLANS TO FAST-TRACK TOKENIZED SECURITIES (1 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 SEC Chair Paul Atkins is implementing a fast-track approval process
for certain crypto products, with plans to temporarily permit trading
of select tokenized securities while the commission develops
comprehensive long-term regulatory frameworks. This is in line with
the current friendly SEC approach, prioritizing market access and
innovation over waiting for complete rulemaking.

 STRATEGY BUYS 592 MORE BTC, HOLDINGS REACH 717,722 (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Michael Saylor's Strategy purchased another 592 BTC for $39.8M at an
average price of $67,286, bringing total holdings to 717,722 BTC, or
over 3.4% of Bitcoin's 21 million supply. 

 B2B STABLECOINS COULD HIT $7T BY 2027 (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 B2B stablecoin transaction volume increased ~582.6% in 2024 from $23B
(vs. ACH's $58T and +8.6% growth) to $157B. 

 JUPITER CHOOSES BUYBACKS OVER EMISSIONS (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Jupiter's governance voted 73.9% to eliminate all emissions and
redirect roughly $848M in annualized fees into pure buybacks with zero
dilution, making JUP structurally deflationary (about 800M tokens are
staked). 

 THE TOMB WE BUILT (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Standard four-year monthly token unlock schedules create destructive
recurring sell pressure.
