MARKETS & BUSINESS

 $1.43B HEIST ON BYBIT (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 ByBit recently suffered the largest crypto hack in history, losing
$1.43 billion in Ethereum and other assets after hackers exploited a
front-end spoofing attack, deceiving multisig signers into approving
malicious transactions. The attack, linked to North Korea's Lazarus
Group, highlights critical vulnerabilities in multisig and hardware
wallet security, particularly the risks of "blind signing" and
compromised interfaces. ByBit has assured users their funds are safe
and launched a $140 million recovery bounty, but the incident
underscores the urgent need for stronger security measures across the
crypto industry. 

 SEC DISMISSED UNLAWFUL ENFORCEMENT CASE AGAINST COINBASE (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Coinbase has reached an agreement with SEC staff to dismiss all
litigation against the company with no fines or business changes
required, pending final Commission approval expected next week. The
resolution comes after the company's decision to fight the SEC's
demands to delist certain assets in 2023. CEO Brian Armstrong argues
this dismissal validates their position that the SEC was exceeding its
legal authority and could have severely damaged the US crypto industry
if unopposed. Coinbase spent around $50 million fighting the SEC.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ELI5 WHY WE CAN'T "ROLLBACK" ETHEREUM? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Following ByBit's recent $1.4B hack, there have been calls for a
rollback of the Ethereum blockchain to get the coins out of the hands
of the North Korean hackers. This is technically impossible since the
hack involved properly signed transactions rather than protocol-level
issues, and the funds were immediately movable, unlike the 2016 TheDAO
hack's month-long withdrawal delay. Ethereum's current interconnected
nature with DeFi protocols, bridges, and real-world assets means any
rollback would incur ripple effects across the entire ecosystem. 

 JESSE POLLAK'S THESIS ON COINS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 All content will eventually move onchain, with ERC20 tokens emerging
as the dominant pricing mechanism due to their superior composability
and liquidity. While there are challenges around token mechanics and
cultural stigmas against crypto, these barriers must be overcome
through open experimentation rather than avoided. Base is encouraging
this experimentation and a movement toward open token-based content
monetization systems.

 ABSTRACT FEEDBACK (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Abstract is making changes to clarify that its chain can be used with
any existing wallet, not just the Abstract Global Wallet (AGW).
Updates include a new first-time login screen and a redesigned
homepage for easier navigation. 

 UNVEILING LAZARUS GROUP'S INTRUSION TECHNIQUES (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored hacking group, has been
targeting cryptocurrency exchanges using advanced social engineering
and technical exploits. The attackers used malicious code disguised as
legitimate projects, exploited vulnerabilities like pyyaml for remote
code execution, and moved laterally within networks to steal
cryptocurrency assets. Enhanced security measures, including network
segmentation, endpoint monitoring, and improved employee awareness,
are recommended to defend against such sophisticated APT (Advanced
Persistent Threat) attacks.
