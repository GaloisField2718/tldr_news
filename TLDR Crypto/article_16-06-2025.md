MARKETS & BUSINESS

 WALMART, AMAZON CONSIDER ISSUING OWN STABLECOINS (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Walmart and Amazon are reportedly exploring issuing their own
dollar-backed stablecoins to cut transaction costs and speed up
e-commerce and cross-border payments by diverting billions in banking
fees onto onchain rails. These brand-specific tokens would capitalize
on growing regulatory clarity under the GENIUS Act, which aims to
standardize stablecoin collateralization and AML compliance. Their
moves follow Shopify's planned USDC integration and discussions among
banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America about joint stablecoin
launches, signaling a broader institutional embrace of regulated
digital dollars. 

 SEC CLEARS TRUMP MEDIA FILING, OPEN DOOR TO BILLION-DOLLAR BITCOIN
BUY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The SEC has declared effective Trump Media's registration for its
Bitcoin treasury strategy, unlocking $2.3B in capital that can now be
used to purchase BTC at the company's discretion. While the exact
allocation and timeline remain undisclosed, the filing also includes a
$12B universal shelf for future stock, debt, or warrant issuance.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES ARE COMING ONCHAIN (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CEXes like Coinbase, Binance, and Bybit are going on-chain with
hybrid products that blend DEX access and institutional safeguards.
Coinbase offers Base-native swaps and KYC-gated Verified Pools,
Binance Alpha curates early-stage tokens across chains, and Bybit's
Byreal uses Solana for RFQ-style pricing and yield layers. These moves
position CEXes as trusted gateways into permissionless markets while
retaining Web2 UX. 

 YUPP: CRYPTO-INCENTIVIZED AI MODEL EVALUATION PLATFORM (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Yupp is a new platform for evaluating and using LLMs. Users can query
top models for multiple answers, then earn crypto credits or fiat via
Stripe, PayPal, and Coinbase by providing feedback that helps train
and benchmark models. That feedback feeds Yupp's “VIBE Score”
leaderboard, giving AI builders provable, audit-ready evaluation data
and giving users transparent rewards. Yupp utilizes blockchains as a
“trust machine” for transparent, user-owned AI model evaluation.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MACRO LIQUIDITY, TRUMP-ERA POLICIES, AND CRYPTO'S INSTITUTIONAL SHIFT
(28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trump-era policies like the FIT21 Act, SEC leadership shifts, and
stablecoin legalization are accelerating institutional adoption of
crypto. With growing macro liquidity constraints and looming rate
cuts, crypto is benefiting from structural policy clarity and rising
ETF-driven inflows. While proposals like a U.S. sovereign BTC reserve
remain theoretical, the cycle is clearly being driven by
regulation-backed mainstream integration, not retail speculation. 

 ON THE FUTURE OF THE BLOB MEMPOOL (30 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethereum's PeerDAS upgrade vertically shards onchain data
availability checks, meaning validators now only verify a subset of
each blob, yet the blobpool still forces every node to download full
blobs, threatening to overwhelm lower-resourced operators as blob
counts rise. To realign with the sharded DA checks, this proposal
introduces a vertically-sharded blobpool where originators gossip only
assigned blob columns, governed by a free, first-price auction with
refunds for slot-based “blobpool tickets” to prevent DoS attacks
under high demand. This market-driven approach preserves rollup
inclusion guarantees and avoids the degraded service of simple
horizontal sharding, while private blob flows and CL downloads remain
intact. Remaining challenges include fine-tuning auction parameters,
exploring reputation-based spam defenses, and coordinating rollups,
builders, and stakers ahead of implementation.

 ETHEREUM FOUNDATION DONATES TO TORNADO CASH CO-FOUNDER'S DEFENSE (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Ethereum Foundation has donated $500,000 to fund Tornado Cash
co-founder Roman Storm's legal defense and will match up to $750,000
more in community contributions. His trial will start on July 14 in
New York. Storm faces conspiracy charges for money laundering and
sanctions violations tied to the 2022 OFAC sanction on Tornado Cash,
though unlicensed money-transmitter counts were dropped under the
previous administration. The Foundation's support is justified by its
belief that privacy is normal and writing code is not a crime. 

 STRIPE, BRIDGE, AND PRIVY: BUILDING THE ONCHAIN BANKING STACK (14
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Together, Bridge and Privy create a “Regulatory Arbitrage as a
Service” platform that avoids traditional banking custody and
licensing hurdles. This integrated Fintech 3.0 OS empowers developers
to spin up programmable wallets, stablecoin payouts, and global USD
rails via API with Stripe-grade UX and compliance. Looking ahead,
Stripe is poised to expand into onchain lending, digital asset
licensing, FX rails, and even a potential consumer app to round out
its programmable finance ecosystem.
