 ITHACA, A PARADIGM SPINOFF BUILDING A LAYER 2 ‘FROM THE FUTURE' (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Crypto venture capital firm Paradigm announced that its CTO and
General Partner, Georgios Konstantopoulos, will serve as CEO of the
company. He will help build the full stack of products and tools that
developers need to ship faster and that consumers need to have less
and less friction. The Odyssey L2, built using Reth and the OP Stack,
is live on testnet. To stand out in the competitive rollup space,
Odyssey will first implement features from Ethereum's roadmap,
including better smart contract wallets to reduce user onboarding
friction. 

 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATION OF RESTAKING IN LAYERZERO (18
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LayerZero's Restaking DVN Framework built on EigenLayer introduces
“Protocol Aligned Interoperability” by allowing protocols to
integrate their tokens and governance into omnichain security
infrastructure. It enables protocols to stake collateral to secure
cross-chain communication and expand their influence beyond their
infrastructure across multiple chains. Slashing conditions and trust
assumptions become far more transparent. While this is promising for
security and customization, the real-world implementation remains to
be tested.

 ARTHUR HAYES: PVP (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Recent crypto token launches have underperformed for retail
investors. Data shows that listing on CEXs does not guarantee price
appreciation despite high listing fees. Projects have been launching
at inflated valuations, benefitting VCs but harming retail investors.
Founders should prioritize lower initial valuations and user growth to
create a stronger and more aligned community. A DEX-first approach
with gradual CEX adoption is one option to create value for users and
token holders before VCs. 

 L1 & L2 TOKEN VALUE CAPTURE (60 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article introduces new financial metrics for evaluating crypto
networks, including Total Economic Value (TEV), Real Economic Value
(REV), and Token Holders' Net Income, emphasizing the distinction
between network economics and token holder economics. It challenges
common misconceptions about network profitability, particularly
regarding proof of stake issuance, and indicates that L1 and L2
networks have similar profitability calculations for token holders.
While the article focuses on income-generating aspects of blockchains,
it also acknowledges additional value capture mechanisms like utility
value and store-of-value properties, highlighting the complexity of a
comprehensive and quantitative token valuation.

 HAYDEN ADAMS ON UNISWAP'S FUTURE (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Uniswap team is tackling the complex issue of user onboarding in
a multi-chain DeFi environment, aiming to preserve the simplicity and
interoperability that existed when DeFi operated on a single chain
(Ethereum). They are developing comprehensive solutions across the
entire tech stack, from front-end to smart contracts, to accelerate
DeFi's growth and maintain its open, seamless nature. 

 ETHEREUM VS. SOLANA (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ethereum's extensive network effect (80% of crypto developers work in
the Ethereum ecosystem) enables a competitive advantage over Solana,
which, despite its high market cap and speed, lacks unique features
and faces threats from both quicker low-cap L1s and Ethereum's Layer
2s, making ETH a safer long-term investment in the smart contract
space.
