 RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT CONSIDERING LEGALIZING STABLECOINS FOR
CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Russia is considering legalizing stablecoins for international
transactions to improve cross-border payments and mitigate the effects
of ongoing sanctions. The Russian Central Bank is looking to regulate
the transaction chain from entry to utilization. Its initiative would
primarily target facilitating transactions with BRICS countries
effectively integrating stablecoins into the national framework for
international settlements. 

 GERMAN GOVERNMENT SELLING UP TO $175M BTC (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The German Government recently transferred a total of 3,000 BTC,
worth ~$175M, to centralized exchanges (e.g., Kraken, Bitstamp, and
Coinbase) and potentially to an institutional service or OTC. This
indicates a significant sale or reallocation of the government's
Bitcoin holdings.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 EIP-7732: ENSHRINED PROPOSER BUILDER SEPARATION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ePBS, a change to the Ethereum protocol that separates blocks into
consensus and execution parts, now has an EIP number. Introducing this
feature gives attesters more time to execute transactions, makes
proposer-builder interactions trustless, and removes the need for
staker middleware. 

 ERC-5564 AND ERC-6538 PAVE THE WAY FOR STEALTH ADDRESS PAYMENTS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ERC-5564 and ERC-6538 introduce stealth address payments on Ethereum,
providing Monero-like privacy by allowing transactions to be received
at one-time, non-reusable addresses generated via cryptographic
methods to enhance user privacy. Using this approach, transaction
histories aren't visible to the public, which would cater to the next
billion users who prefer confidential transactions and enable a range
of use cases, from private payments to discrete NFT transfers.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE PRIVATIZATION OF ORDERFLOW AND RESURGENCE OF THE FAT APP THESIS
(5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Nearly half of the $25 billion in orderflow volume over the past
month on Ethereum has come from private or proprietary applications.
The trend started with DeFi summer, when transaction aggregators,
wallet swaps, Telegram bots, and solver networks launched. This
development supports the fat app thesis, where applications
controlling user attention and order flow would accrue the most value
in the ecosystem. 

 HYPERLIQUID THESIS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Over the past year, Hyperliquid has grown to host 150,000 users and
over $220 billion in volume. Traders at all levels and across Crypto
Twitter like the platform, and it has found product/market fit. Over
95% of Hyperliquid users are down on their trades but continue to use
the platform, creating a community moat.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FRIENDTECH'S DOWNFALL (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Friendtech's journey started with promising tech and a strong
community in the SocialFi space, inspiring numerous clones and
innovations. However, the project has faced severe missteps, including
high fees, community hostility, lack of meaningful updates, and poor
handling of sybil attacks, leading to a collapse in sentiment and
value. 

 WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH MEGAETH? (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MegaETH is an L2 with sub-second latency and 100k TPS. It recently
had angel participation from Vitalik Buterin. MegaETH separates
transaction processing into three node types - sequencers, provers,
and full nodes - that centralize block building but retain trustless
verification. It also stores its state in the sequencer memory and
optimizes its compiler to improve efficiency.

QUICK LINKS

 RABBY WALLET QUIETLY ADDS A FEE TO THEIR SWAPS (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Rabby has introduced a 0.25% swaps fee - it is not prominently
displayed and can only be seen by scrolling in the UI, potentially
misleading users who don't notice the hidden fee. 

 $WELL TOKEN LAUNCH DISASTER (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The $WELL token launch had a contract loophole, allowing early sales
and causing a significant drop in token value before the community
could claim their tokens. 

 FRIEND.TECH NO LONGER MOVING CHAINS (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 After receiving backlash for signaling plans to move away from the
Base L2, friend.tech has announced that it will remain on Base as a
100% community-controlled token. 

 DECLINE OF VANILLA L2S (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Manta and Mode have fallen below $1B FDV as general-purpose EVM L2s
become less appealing to investors.
