 A FORMAL ANALYSIS OF CRYPTO INFLUENCERS (50 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This paper analyzes investment information provided by crypto
influencers on Twitter. It explores a massive dataset of 180 creators,
36,000 tweets, and 1,600 assets from 2020-2022. Though the tweets are
initially correlated with positive returns, this is followed by
negative price action, making the tweets negligible in the long term. 

 USING ETHEREUM TO UNDERSTAND THE PROTOCOL ECONOMY (6 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Tech companies have created the entrenched platform economy, where
they utilize network effects to obtain proprietary data. Blockchain
enables the protocol economy, allowing for digital property rights,
scarcity, and software-enforced ownership. Ethereum, as a
general-purpose blockchain, lets protocols and infrastructure be built
on top of its chain, with ETH acting as both a utility token and
ownership in the network. It can be analyzed using traditional
financial metrics by looking at its fees, profits, and margins, all of
which have been increasing over the past twelve months.
