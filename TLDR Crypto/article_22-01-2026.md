MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TRUMP PUSHES CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE BILL (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 President Trump said he hopes to sign sweeping crypto market
structure legislation “very soon,” reiterating at the World
Economic Forum that the US should be the global crypto capital as
Congress races to finalize the bill. Momentum is colliding with
internal fractures, as banks and crypto firms clash over stablecoin
rewards, Coinbase pulls support, and lawmakers scramble to resolve
yield and oversight disputes before the bill loses steam. 

 IRAN'S CENTRAL BANK BOUGHT $507M IN USDT TO SHORE UP THE RIAL (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elliptic's investigation claims Iran's central bank purchased at
least $507m of USDT last year via OTC routes (payments in UAE dirhams,
linked to an entity called Modex), routed much of it through Nobitex
and cross-chain bridges into DEXs and other exchanges to stabilize the
rial and settle trade, and ultimately moved all identified USDT out of
CBI-linked wallets. This demonstrates that stablecoins can facilitate
sanctioned states' dollar access while also leaving an on-chain trail
that enables freezes and enforcement actions.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING SPENDLE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Pendle Finance is replacing its vePENDLE vote-escrowed token with
sPENDLE, a liquid staking token that eliminates multi-year lock
requirements in favor of a 14-day withdrawal period. The new
tokenomics model redirects protocol revenue toward PENDLE buybacks
rather than direct distributions. This transition improves capital
efficiency for token holders while maintaining governance
participation, marking a shift from traditional ve-tokenomics to a
more liquid staking architecture. 

 A NEW NOBLE WORLD (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Noble is migrating its Cosmos SDK-based blockchain to a standalone
EVM Layer 1, a notable change for the pioneering stablecoin-centric
protocol that serves as critical USDC infrastructure in the Cosmos
ecosystem. The move to EVM compatibility opens Noble to the broader
Ethereum ecosystem while maintaining its focus on stablecoin issuance
and cross-chain transfers. It also signals the lack of interest in the
Cosmos ecosystem after poor adoption in the past several years.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BRIDGING THE CAPITAL CHASM: UNLOCKING WEALTH CREATION (10 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The "capital chasm" is where US capital income surged 136% versus 57%
labor income growth over 40 years, leaving 4 billion adults with zero
equity or bond market access as the real divide separates the
"unbrokered" from those able to invest beyond basic banking.
Tokenization on public blockchains enables fractional ownership,
reducing minimum thresholds from weeks of wages to mobile top-up
amounts with near-instant settlement and cutting transaction costs
over 30%, mirroring stablecoins' proof of cross-border value transfer.
Policy recommendations include upholding blockchain neutrality,
establishing clear tokenization pathways for traditional assets,
allowing bank engagement with tokenization infrastructure, and
recognizing self-custody rights. 

 11 AI X CRYPTO CROSSOVERS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post outlines 11 use cases at the AI-crypto intersection.
Blockchains offer a counterbalance to centralizing forces in AI by
enabling decentralized, credibly neutral, and user-ownable networks.
Compelling crossovers include persistent data/context portability
across AI systems, universal identity passports for AI agents,
forwards-compatible proof of personhood using protocols like World,
and micropayments for AI services.

 INSTITUTIONALIZING RISK CURATION IN DECENTRALIZED CREDIT (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 DeFi lending was restructured between 2022-2025 into a two-layer
architecture where base protocols provide infrastructure while
ERC-4626 vaults and third-party curators determine critical
underwriting decisions. Aave maintains 45% market share with $34B TVL,
while $7.27B in curated TVL is concentrated among top managers like
Gauntlet (27.6%), Steakhouse (17.8%), and MEV Capital (12.6%). The
research proposes minimal onchain disclosure standards for comparable
risk assessment across vault strategies. 

 KALSHI VS POLYMARKET: GREENLAND SPREAD ISN'T FREE MONEY (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Kalshi estimates a US acquisition of Greenland during Trump's term at
roughly 42-45% while Polymarket prices a 2026-specific outcome at
~15–23%. The apparent arbitrage is largely explained by different
contract phrasing, settlement windows, and oracle/condition
differences. This means a trader eligible to trade in both markets
could narrow obvious gaps, but persistent spreads can remain rational
once the markets are compared on identical terms.

 GENERATION MOONSHOT AND THE AGE OF ROLLING BUBBLES (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Crypto lost its monopoly on moonshot returns as similar
high-risk/high-reward profiles now exist across meme stocks, sports
betting, and other speculative assets. 

 EXTERNAL BRIDGES VS ROLLUPS' SECURITY COUNCILS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 When tokens bridge between chains, someone must mint at the
destination, and trust assumptions differ dramatically based on who
controls minting authority. 

 EVERYONE IS QUIETLY SWITCHING TO INTENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Intent-based trading has moved from experimental to mainstream
adoption across DeFi, with protocols like CoW Swap pioneering the
architecture since 2022. 

 SOLANA TOKEN LAUNCH FRENZY FUELED BY CLAUDE CODE VIRALITY (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Anthropic's Claude Code going viral has triggered a speculative boom
on Solana as developers and traders used Bags (Solana launchpad) to
mint tokens tied to trending AI repos.
