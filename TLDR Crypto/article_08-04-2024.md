MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE CLEARED IN LAWSUIT OVER CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS (2 MINUTE READ)
[3] 

 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit confirmed that
Coinbase did not violate the Securities Exchange Act by engaging in
secondary sales of cryptocurrencies. This case was related to a
lawsuit from Coinbase users accusing the platform of selling
unregistered securities and violating related laws â€“ not the recent
SEC case alleging they are an unlicensed securities exchange and
brokerage. The court ruled that without a contract that can be
rescinded, there is no Exchange Act violation, meaning trading
cryptocurrencies on Coinbase does not constitute securities trading.

 This thread discusses the QUIC protocol's challenges in blockchain

 WHAT CRYPTO VCS ARE THINKING ABOUT (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto VCs are currently debating the merits of investing in "useful"
versus meme-driven projects, with some leaning into the hype while
others focus on more substantive areas like stablecoins, real-world
assets, and social applications. There is also debate around whether
mainstream adoption will be driven by Web 2.5 apps that abstract away
crypto complexities or Web3 apps with tokens and protocols front and
center.
