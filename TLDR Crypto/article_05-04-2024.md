outcomes. Interactions in Essential are defined in terms of their

 All successful crypto products are inherently consumer-oriented.
Tokens are the true crypto products - this can be seen by examining
universal attributes of thriving consumer brands like desire-based
pricing, power law consumption, and addictive properties. This

infrastructure by suggesting that the most successful crypto
applications already possess the key traits of consumer adoption.
