 CRYPTO OVERCOMING AI'S CHALLENGES (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI faces challenges in resource aggregation, composability, and
interacting with native payment rails. Crypto solves these problems
through incentivization mechanisms to encourage participation and
collaboration among parties. Projects like EigenLayer help solve for
composability through verifiability, which ensures that agents perform
tasks in their expected manner and can thus be chained together. 

 RETHINKING OWNERSHIP, STABLECOINS, AND TOKENIZATION (12 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Traditional asset ownership relies on obscure, centralized ledger
systems that could be disrupted by native onchain tokenization.
Stablecoins are like tokenized dollars, and operate similarly to
fractional reserve banking by creating net new money backed by
treasury assets. This dynamic raises questions about how crypto can
properly integrate with traditional finance, particularly as
regulatory frameworks evolve.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DO NOT LAUNCH ON A CHAIN FOR MARKETING (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Builders should choose a blockchain based on its user base, technical
suitability, and long-term potential rather than relying on the chain
to market their product for them. Ultimately, success comes from
solving a real problem and creating a compelling solution, not from
external marketing support.

support to improve trading capabilities. It plans to implement
