MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FED GOVERNOR: POLICY NEEDS TO ADJUST TO STABLECOIN BOOM (6 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran warned that stablecoin growth
projected to reach $1-3 trillion by decade's end, compared to under $7
trillion in outstanding Treasury bills, will force monetary policy
adjustments as demand for dollar-tied assets surges. The GENIUS Act's
prohibition on direct yield means stablecoins won't drain US bank
deposits but will instead attract demand from locales lacking access
to dollar-denominated savings instruments, strengthening the dollar
and potentially triggering Fed policy responses. 

 CFTC PUSHES FOR REGULATED LEVERAGED SPOT CRYPTO TRADING (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham confirmed plans to launch leveraged
spot crypto trading on regulated US exchanges like CME, Cboe, Coinbase
Derivatives, Kalshi, and Polymarket US as soon as next month. The
initiative uses existing Commodity Exchange Act authority to bring
margin-based crypto trading under federal oversight, offering
institutional-grade protections previously absent in offshore markets.
It marks a major policy shift toward mainstream adoption and could
reshape how both retail and institutional investors access leveraged
exposure to bitcoin and ether in the US.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 RIFT: THE FIRST P2P BITCOIN TRADING PROTOCOL (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Rift is introducing self-custodial, peer-to-peer swaps between
Ethereum and Bitcoin. The feature leverages TEE technology to create a
system where wallets storing funds only unlock upon user payment being
verified onchain. The team is working with DEXs like Uniswap to allow
any ERC20 to be traded for Bitcoin. It is now live on mainnet. There
will be a larger launch at Devconnect next week. 

 THE STABLECOIN GOLD RUSH AND WHY ORCHESTRATION WILL WIN (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 As the stablecoin market passes $27 trillion in annual volume and
$213 billion in supply, the real winners won't be the miners (L1s,
L2s, or issuers) chasing razor-thin margins, but the shovel sellers
(e.g., orchestration platforms automating payments, compliance, and
settlement). Orchestration cuts costs and turns stablecoin rails into
usable financial infrastructure by simplifying fragmented processes
like bridging and off-ramping into one automated workflow. Just as
Stripe and AWS captured value above commoditized infrastructure,
orchestration will become the sticky, high-margin layer powering the
next phase of onchain finance.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 GALAXY BRAIN RESISTANCE (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 "Galaxy brain resistance" is a measure of how difficult it is to
abuse reasoning styles to rationalize pre-decided conclusions.
Low-resistance patterns enable harmful rationalizations across crypto
and AI: inevitabilism (full automation is inevitable, so we should
hasten it), longtermism (disconnection from reality by claiming vague
trillion-year benefits), and financial apologia (justifying risky
speculation as "class mobility for the poor" despite zero-sum casino
dynamics where concave utility curves make large coinflips
net-negative). Power maximization strategies in EA/AI safety circles
where "accumulate power to do good at pivotal moments" has become
indistinguishable from greedy egomaniacs. Solutions should emphasize
deontological ethics with hard rules (don't kill, don't steal, and
respect freedom) over consequentialism's lack of galaxy brain
resistance and holding correct incentive bags. 

 5 PRIVACY COINS THAT PUMPED LAST WEEK (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Privacy coins surged last week as Zcash flipped Monero to become the
largest privacy coin by market cap, climbing 76% to $632 following its
integration with Near Intents for cross-chain swaps and private
payments. Dash led gains at 130% after Aster DEX launched perpetual
futures trading with 5x leverage, while ZKsync jumped 113% amid
proposed tokenomics changes to add economic utility through fee
capture and enterprise licensing. Decred spiked 90% and Monero gained
10% in a narrative-driven rally fueled by growing concerns over
government privacy infringements.

 NEOBANKS IN CRYPTO (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Less than 5% of neobanks achieve profitability due to overreliance on
thin interchange fees, inability to monetize idle deposits through
lending, and high customer acquisition costs that traditional banks
avoid through organic growth. Crypto neobanks face steeper challenges
as self-custody models prevent interest income generation, stablecoin
payments compress margins further, and regulatory compliance costs
remain fixed while serving low-balance retail users. Revolut's crypto
wealth division generated £506 million in 2024 (up 298% YoY) and
Phantom Wallet projects $79 million from in-wallet swaps,
demonstrating that embedded trading and structured DeFi yield products
offer the only viable path to profitability. The winning strategy
involves building infrastructure – yield routers, stablecoin FX
layers, and DeFi wrappers – that plugs into existing neobank
distribution rather than competing directly with established players. 

 HOW TO POSITION FOR THE PREDICTION MARKETS CYCLE (4 MINUTE READ) [11]


 If you had $10K today and wanted to bet on the prediction markets
cycle, focus first on securing stable income and mental clarity, as
the edge is headspace, not geography. Skip majors like BTC and ETH and
instead, trade small to learn edge recognition and exploit mispriced
spreads between Polymarket and Kalshi while allocating to
infrastructure plays like SEDA, PYTH, and LINK that power real-time
data and oracle layers. The real opportunity lies in the AI-agent
layer because autonomous trading systems like FractionAI, Talus Labs,
and Sire Agent already execute live strategies. Document your process,
trade tiny, and compound conviction through consistency, not hype.
