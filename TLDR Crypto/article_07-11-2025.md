 BALANCER BLAMES ROUNDING ERROR FOR $128M MULTI-CHAIN EXPLOIT (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Balancer has identified a rounding flaw in its swap logic as the root
cause of the November 3 exploit that drained over $128 million from
its Composable Stable Pools (CSPs) across multiple chains, including
Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Polygon. The issue stemmed
from a rounding error in the upscale function for EXACT_OUT swaps
within the v2 vault's batchSwap feature, which attackers used to
manipulate pool balances and siphon liquidity. Emergency response
teams like Hypernative, SEAL 911, StakeWise DAO, and BitFinding helped
recover portions of the stolen funds, with StakeWise DAO retrieving
73.5% of osETH losses. The exploit primarily affected v5 CSPs, while
v6 pools were automatically paused, and Balancer v3 remains
unaffected. 

 COINBASE URGES TREASURY TO KEEP GENIUS ACT INNOVATION-FRIENDLY (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Coinbase has called on the US Treasury Department to ensure that
upcoming regulations for the GENIUS Act remain faithful to
congressional intent, warning against regulatory overreach that could
stifle innovation and hinder America's ambition to become the
“crypto capital of the world.” Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad
emphasized that the rules should focus narrowly on stablecoin issuers,
not on software developers, validators, or open-source protocols.
Coinbase also encouraged Treasury to clarify that loyalty and rewards
programs do not constitute “interest” payments prohibited under
the Act and to classify payment stablecoins as cash equivalents for
tax and accounting purposes.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ALMANAK'S AI STRATEGY BUILDER (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Almanak's Strategy Builder allows agents to build strategies for
users to deploy and dynamically change over time. Its launch video
demoed an LP accumulation strategy to provide liquidity and accumulate
the underlying tokens. Almanak's templates allow for slight
alterations via natural language. Each strategy has a unique,
AI-generated dashboard with custom metrics specific to the strategy's
implementation. 

 HYPERSTITION MARKETS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hyperstition Markets introduce prediction markets engineered for
reality construction rather than passive forecasting, rewarding
traders for both accurate prediction and narrative enactment. The
mechanism requires traders to demonstrate actions aligned with
predictions verified through smart contracts, creating Nash equilibria
where rational actors maximize returns by betting on and working
toward specific futures. Applications include technological
development bootstrapping, cultural transformation requiring
epistemological framework shifts, and collective action problems where
early believers profit from manifesting self-fulfilling prophecies.
Unlike traditional prediction markets aiming for unbiased information
aggregation, treating futures as discovered, Hyperstition Markets
explicitly engineer reflexive loops between belief, incentive, and
action, treating futures as designed.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 LIQUIDITY, THE LIFEBLOOD OF CRYPTO (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto's three primary liquidity channels – DATs, stablecoins, and
ETFs – have plateaued after strong momentum through Q1 2025.
Combined DATs and ETFs have grown from $40 billion to $270 billion
since early 2024, while stablecoins doubled from $140 billion to $290
billion before flattening. Despite global M2 expansion and US
quantitative tightening officially ending, high SOFR rates keep cash
parked in T-bills yielding attractive returns, redirecting liquidity
away from crypto into equity markets instead of compounding digital
asset inflows. The slowdown across all three channels signals broad
deceleration in fresh capital deployment rather than simple product
rotation. Crypto entered a "self-funded phase" where capital rotates
internally between majors and alt sectors rather than entering net
new, creating PVP dynamics with short-lived rallies, narrowing
breadth, and volatility spikes driven by liquidation cascades instead
of sustained trends. 

 ETHEREUM SHOULD TAKE THIS LESSON FROM HYPERLIQUID (6 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Phantom wallet earned nearly $10 million in under 6 months from
Hyperliquid builder codes by charging 0.05% fees on $20 billion in
perps volume. Hyperliquid's builder code system has distributed nearly
$40 million to app builders while generating over $100 billion in
additional perps volume. Polymarket launched a similar program that
has processed $50 million+ in betting volume through third-party apps.
ERC-8021 proposes native builder code integration for Ethereum through
a transaction suffix and a code registry smart contract that maps
builder codes to wallet addresses for automated payouts. The system
creates onchain attribution for any transaction, allowing platforms to
reward app builders transparently, positioning Ethereum to compete
with Hyperliquid's proven model that rewards developers based on value
provided rather than grants or fundraising.

MISCELLANEOUS

 APPS ARE NOW OUT-EARNING BLOCKCHAINS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Leading crypto applications like Pump.fun ($724M revenue) and
Hyperliquid ($667M) are now out-earning the blockchains they're built
on, such as Solana ($1.3B revenue, $632M in fees). These apps trade at
far lower valuations despite using most of their revenue for token
buybacks and transparent cash flows, while L1s retain only a fraction
of the activity-generated value. The long-standing assumption that
chains capture proportional value from ecosystem growth is breaking
down as onchain value accrues to applications, not infrastructure. The
“L1 premium” could continue eroding unless chains find new
mechanisms, like white-labeled stablecoins, to internalize more of the
liquidity and fees flowing through their ecosystems. 

 ETHEREUM'S NEXT 5 YEARS AS THE RISK-FREE ASSET (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ethereum's future lies in proof aggregation, with L2s like ZKsync
defragmenting the network and scaling it to millions of TPS, rendering
alternative L1s obsolete. The Ethereum L1 remains the source of
incorruptibility and neutrality, expected to reach 10,000+ TPS within
three years, but still not enough for global demand. As L2s evolve
into cashflow machines replacing traditional payment rails (e.g.,
credit cards, FX, and remittance apps), their success will flow back
to Ethereum, which underpins their security. Investors should own the
L2s generating yield to accumulate ETH, the risk-free asset of the EVM
economy.
