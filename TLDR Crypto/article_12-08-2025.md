MARKETS & BUSINESS

 PAXOS AIMS FOR NATIONAL BANK CHARTER (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Paxos is applying for a national trust bank charter with the OCC,
joining Ripple and Circle in seeking federal oversight as the GENIUS
Act reshapes stablecoin regulation. The issuer of PayPal USD and Pax
Dollar says the move will reinforce its commitment to safety and
transparency, but comes just a week after settling with NYDFS over
past AML and due diligence lapses tied to its Binance partnership. 

 ETH TOPS BTC IN YTD GAINS AMID ETF AND TREASURY DEMAND (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 ETH has overtaken BTC in year-to-date gains, rising 29% compared to
Bitcoin's 28%, as institutional demand pushes Ethereum above $4,000
for the first time since December. The increase has been sparked by
$5B in recent inflows to spot ETH ETFs and growing allocations from
digital asset treasury firms mimicking Strategy's Bitcoin playbook.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 STRIPE BUILDING ‘TEMPO' BLOCKCHAIN WITH CRYPTO VC PARADIGM (6
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stripe is developing a payments-focused layer-1 blockchain called
“Tempo,” per a now-removed product marketing job posting that
described a stealth five-person team working with Paradigm. The chain
is rumored to be EVM-compatible, and follows Stripe's recent
stablecoin push, including the $1.1B acquisition of Bridge and the
purchase of wallet developer Privy, positioning Stripe to own more of
the stablecoin stack from issuance to transaction processing. 

 SHARPLINK RAISES $900M TO BACK ETH STRATEGY (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SharpLink secured nearly $900 million in new capital last week,
signaling strong market conviction in its Ethereum-focused treasury
strategy. The raise highlights growing institutional alignment around
ETH's long-term role in digital finance.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STRING IT TOGETHER: HOW STABLECOINS GO MAINSTREAM (16 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Stablecoins can achieve mainstream US consumer payments adoption by
repeating credit cards' two-step path: first win niche segments on
intrinsic advantages like comparative convenience and powerful
incentives, then connect those “fiefdoms” via an open,
standardized, participant-owned network. Near-term wedges include
cross-border shoppers underserved by dollar rails and incentive-first
programs where merchants launch transferable, whitelabeled stablecoins
funded by float yield, banks' ability to custody stables, and UX
improvements like account abstraction and gas sponsorship.
Programmability enables novel rewards and financing models that can
pull balances into stables and drive spend if checkout is seamless. To
scale, stablecoins need a neutral, user-owned network to enforce
interoperability, compliance, and consumer protections across chains
and issuers. 

 REFLECTIONS, RANT, AND ROAD AHEAD FOR CRYPTO X AI AGENTS (15 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Phase 1 of crypto x AI saw speculative euphoria with a market cap
topping $10B, followed by a collapse where liquidity rotated out,
tokens fell 50-90%, teams went silent, and “L1 for agents”
frameworks/launchpads plus chat UIs failed to deliver production
utility. Today, chat front ends remain too slow/error-prone for
transactions, and many Solana AI tokens trade as memecoins, but
improving agentic models, MCP standardization, and walleted agents are
emerging as workable primitives. Over the next 6-12 months, viable use
cases are expected in complex agentic workflows rather than simple
swaps. In 1+ years, agents could drive stablecoin payments with x402,
enable crypto-native revenue sharing, spur AI-embedded protocols,
verifiability/coordination networks, and an on-chain personal context
layer.

 DESIGN TESTNETS FOR FEEDBACK, NOT FARMING (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Fluent is launching a testnet experience designed around collecting
app feedback rather than traditional "chain farming," arguing that
current testnets have devolved into spam-filled environments where
users perform mindless tasks hoping for token rewards. The company
criticizes how chains typically optimize for vanity metrics like
transaction volume and user counts instead of fostering the
development of useful applications that drive long-term success.
Fluent's approach focuses on helping builders iterate toward
product-market fit by systematically collecting and analyzing user
feedback across areas like usability, engagement, and performance.
This "apps first" philosophy positions chains as infrastructure that
succeeds when the applications built on them succeed, similar to how
AWS benefits from Netflix's success. 

 STRIPE'S STABLECOIN STRATEGY CULMINATES IN NEW L1 (1 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Stripe's stablecoin journey has rapidly evolved from basic onramps in
2022 to launching its own L1 blockchain, “Tempo,” in 2025. After
acquiring Bridge Stablecoin and Privy for over $1B each, Stripe is now
positioned to vertically integrate payments, wallets, and chain
infrastructure.
