 THE ROLE OF CRYPTO IN AN AGENTIC ECONOMY (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The rise of AI agents as key economic participants will transition
human-to-agent and agent-to-agent commerce toward a more autonomous,
efficient, and decentralized ecosystem, where crypto rails like
blockchains and stablecoins are positioned to play a more crucial role
because of their programmability, global accessibility, and cost
advantages over traditional systems. This evolution will create value
for infrastructure layers like ID verification, settlement
blockchains, and stablecoin issuers, while reshaping competition to
focus on performance over branding, ultimately benefiting end-users
with more optimized services.
