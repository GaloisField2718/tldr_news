CONGRESS IS 'STARTING FROM SCRATCH' ON STABLECOIN LEGISLATION (6
MINUTE READ)
[https://decrypt.co/137273/congress-starting-from-scratch-stablecoin-legislation?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


The US House Financial Services Committee is reassessing stablecoin
regulations, with members expressing concerns about crypto's impact on
traditional finance. A new stablecoin bill, currently unnamed, faces
criticism for not separating crypto assets from the banking system.
The bill proposes a regulatory framework for stablecoins at both state
and federal levels and sets standards for interoperability, reporting,
and enforcement. The discussion follows recent banking crises and the
collapse of Terra's UST stablecoin, which sparked calls for stablecoin
regulation from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and SEC Chair Gary
Gensler. 

EURO-PEGGED STABLECOIN FROM SOCIETE GENERALE IN THE WORKS (2 MINUTE
READ)
[https://blockworks.co/news/euro-stablecoin-societe-generale-ethereum?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Societe Generale's FORGE team plans to launch EUR CoinVertible
(EURCV), a euro-pegged, ERC-20 stablecoin. EURCV aims to help
institutional investors manage cash flow and bridge traditional
markets with digital assets. Adhering to EU banking and regulatory
standards, SG-FORGE will issue the stablecoin, while a reputable agent
manages the collateral. Legal separation between the collateral and
SG-FORGE ensures protection for EURVC holders, who can redeem their
collateral if stability mechanisms are in danger. The legal structure
also safeguards clients from technological failures on-chain.

THE BEGINNERâ€™S GUIDE TO CONSENSUS MECHANISMS (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://blockworks.co/news/consensus-mechanisms-guide?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Blockchain consensus mechanisms are vital for maintaining security,
scalability, and decentralization in decentralized networks. The most
common mechanisms are proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS).
Alternative mechanisms face challenges in disrupting the industry, but
Ethereum's recent switch from PoW to PoS proves it is possible.
Consensus mechanisms work by using cryptographic challenges and reward
incentives to verify the authenticity of transactions. Different
mechanisms are designed for specific blockchain use cases and network
conditions, with trade-offs made between scalability,
decentralization, and security. Consensus models are an important
component of a project's long-term potential, so itâ€™s important to
understand them to determine if a project is going to be viable or
not.
