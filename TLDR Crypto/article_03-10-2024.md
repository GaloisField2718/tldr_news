 HOW NORTH KOREA INFILTRATED THE CRYPTO INDUSTRY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A CoinDesk investigation reveals how North Korean IT workers using
fake identities have infiltrated over a dozen blockchain projects,
including high-profile names like SushiSwap and Cosmos. These hires
not only pose serious cybersecurity risks but also expose companies to
legal trouble, as North Korea funnels profits to support its weapons

 ON SOLO STAKING, LOCAL BLOCK BUILDING, AND BLOBS (3 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Recent Ethereum researcher discussions around increasing blob
throughput have strongly emphasized preserving solo staking.
Non-enterprise nodes have a higher percentage of reorg rates, with
local block builders being five times more likely to be reorged than
MEV-Boost builders. While the Dencun hard fork has generally reduced
reorg rates, the improvement has been uneven across validator types,
and there are ongoing challenges around balancing scalability with
decentralization through solo staking.
