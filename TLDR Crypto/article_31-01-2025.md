 WHY ANDRE CRONJE QUIT IN 2022 (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Andre Cronje, DeFi pioneer, admits that relentless SEC investigations
led to his departure from DeFi in 2022, despite launching Yearn and
Keep3r with no token sales, raises, or personal financial benefits.
The SEC's investigation evolved from examining potential securities
violations to scrutinizing Yearn's vaults as investment vehicles,
forcing Cronje to dedicate time and resources to compliance while
halting development work. Though Cronje stepped away from public
engagement, he continued working privately on DeFi and scaling
solutions and is now preparing to release new primitives.

 SBF'S PARENTS SEEK PARDON FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's parents are reportedly seeking a
presidential pardon from Donald Trump and are meeting with lawyers and
Trump administration figures to explore clemency possibilities. SBF is
currently serving a 25-year prison sentence following his conviction
on seven fraud charges related to the collapse of FTX, where he was
found guilty of misusing customer funds and operating a fraudulent
enterprise. While Trump's recent pardon of Ross Ulbricht has
encouraged white-collar defendants to seek clemency, SBF's case
differs significantly from Ulbricht's, which was widely viewed as an
example of regulatory overreach rather than fraud.
