 BLACKROCK SPOTLIGHTS STABLECOIN RISKS IN BITCOIN ETF FILING (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 BlackRock, a leading global asset manager, has called attention to
the risks posed by stablecoins such as USDC and USDT in its
application for a Bitcoin ETF. Although not directly allocating funds
to stablecoins, the firm acknowledges the potential risks they present
to Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole. While outlining any and
all risks in disclosures is simply standard practice in any filing,
these statements still raised eyebrows as BlackRock provides financial
products to Circle, the company behind USDC. 

 COIN CENTER CALLS ON CLEARER REGULATIONS IN THE US - IS CONGRESS OPEN
TO IT? (5 MINUTE READ) [6]

requiring the IRS to create an exemption for minor cryptocurrency
transactions, excluding digital assets from secondary reporting
obligations under US tax law, and clarifying the definition of a
broker to exclude certain individuals within the crypto space. The
suggestions also advocated for more clear guidelines on block rewards,
airdrops, and hard forks for tax purposes.

READ) [11]

measuring value with tokens, which would incentivize users to deepen
their engagement with protocols or apps. Variant also outlined the

 EXIT GAMES FOR EVM VALIDIUMS: THE RETURN OF PLASMA (12 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 This post from Vitalik Buterin discusses the evolution of Plasma, a
blockchain scaling solution, and its applications. Despite initial
hurdles like high data storage costs and issues in generalizing beyond
payments, the introduction of validity proofs or ZK-SNARKs has
potentially breathed new life into Plasma. These proofs could
efficiently address the biggest challenge faced by Plasma. Buterin
delves into more technical aspects of Plasma and how it would work for
NFTs, fungible tokens, and the EVM. 

 THE BUILDER‚ÄôS PERSPECTIVE ON CONSUMER CRYPTO (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This builder report reveals that consumer crypto application
developers are focusing on making user onboarding and fund activation
more seamless for newcomers. The builders believe that key factors for
successful applications are a smooth transaction experience, a fast
activation funnel, secure processes, and engaging experiences. There's
also increased emphasis on developing mobile-first, social, and
media-rich applications that require little technical knowledge. High
transaction fees and bridging are persistent issues that developers in
the space are still grappling with and looking for solutions for.
