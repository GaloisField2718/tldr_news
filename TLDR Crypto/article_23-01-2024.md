 FTX SOLD ABOUT $1B OF GRAYSCALE'S BITCOIN ETF, EXPLAINING MUCH OF
OUTFLOW (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Since converting to an ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has had over
$2 billion in outflows, with the FTX bankruptcy estate accounting for
a significant portion of that. Additional outflows have partly been
attributed to investors moving to lower-fee alternatives like
BlackRock and Fidelity, which have attracted significant inflows. Many
were calling for the ETFs to be a ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù event, and it
has turned out that way in the short term. However, the downward
pressure could ease up now that the FTX estate has fully exited its
GBTC positions.

to gain exposure to crypto and to put protections in place to
safeguard investors.

 DEEP-DIVE ON BTC ETF VOLUME AND FLOWS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This thread aims to debunk current Bitcoin ETF volume and flow
narratives. The author points out discrepancies in reported flows due
to the settlement mismatch between spot Bitcoin and ETFs. He
encourages followers to take a look at the data themselves to
understand the actual situation, suggesting that actual Bitcoin ETF
inflows are around $1 billion, rather than the figures touted by some
news sources and influencers.

 OEV: THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN DEFI ORACLES (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The use of DeFi Oracles, data providers for decentralized platforms,
has been criticized due to high latency periods leading to capital
exploitation. Node operators have a window to manipulate price feeds,
creating a problem known as Oracle Extractable Value (OEV). Companies
like AAVE have experienced ongoing attacks because of OEV. Solutions
such as API3's implementation of fair system OEV extraction through
order flow auctions offer hope. Decentralized oracles like UMA and
API3 are also exploring similar strategies to preserve data integrity.


 NEW DETAILS EMERGE ABOUT SEC‚ÄôS X ACCOUNT HACK, INCLUDING SIM SWAP
(4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The SEC experienced a breach on its X account due to a SIM swap
attack where an unauthorized party gained access to the account and
published a false post about bitcoin ETFs. The SEC, which had disabled
two-factor authentication, regained control of the account and has
since re-enabled the security measure. The breach did not impact the
SEC's systems or data, but it did cause hundreds of millions of
dollars of liquidations across the crypto markets.
