MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC SAYS BROKER-DEALERS NEED TO MAINTAIN CRYPTO PRIVATE KEYS (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The SEC's Division of Trading and Markets indicate that a
broker-dealer can treat itself as having possession/control when it
has exclusive access to the private keys needed to transfer the token.
It also requires written policies and systems to protect keys from
theft, loss, or unauthorized use, plus preparedness for operational
events like network attacks, blockchain malfunctions, and hard forks,
and processes to comply with legal orders to freeze/burn/seize assets.
Custodians must monitor protocol/governance developments and reduce
exposure if there are material security or operational weaknesses. 

 FEDERAL RESERVE WITHDRAWS RESTRICTIVE 2023 POLICY (3 MINUTE READ) [5]


 The Fed rescinded its 2023 policy that put a “strong presumption”
against Fed-supervised state member banks doing “novel” crypto
activities not clearly permissible for national banks, replacing it
with a more flexible approach. Insured state member banks are still
constrained by Section 24, but uninsured state member banks can now
seek Fed permission on a case-by-case basis.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING TEMPO TRANSACTIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tempo Transactions is a new native transaction type designed for
payments at scale. Core features include paying network fees in any
USD stablecoin, batch + concurrent transactions, fee sponsorship,
scheduled payments, and passkey-based auth (FaceID/biometrics). Tempo
positions these as protocol-level primitives to support
enterprise-grade workflows like payroll, payouts, subscriptions,
neobanks/wallet UX, and commerce. Crossmint, Fireblocks, Privy, and
Turnkey are among the ecosystem partners rolling out support. 

 COINBASE CONTINUES “EVERYTHING EXCHANGE” PUSH (3 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Coinbase is rolling out an “everything exchange” bundle that
includes commission-free US stocks/ETFs, prediction markets via
Kalshi, and in-app Solana DEX trading via Jupiter, all alongside
crypto balances (often using USD or USDC). It also announced custom
stablecoins (backed 1:1 by a mix of USDC + other USD stables),
expanded developer APIs and x402, a simplified futures/perps UX, and
Coinbase Advisor, along with broader Base App features and Coinbase
Business distribution.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BRIDGE USDC → USDH ON HYPERLIQUID FOR FREE! (SPONSOR) [8] 

 Why pay to enter the trading arena? Move USDC from any chain straight
into USDH on Hyperliquid with zero fees, zero slippage, and zero extra
steps. Only on Across Protocol.

 HOW BANKS LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE STABLECOINS (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Fears of stablecoins causing immediate “deposit erosion” were
overstated, as there is little evidence of deposit outflows tied to
stablecoin growth because deposits are “sticky” because of the
checking account's role as the hub for payroll, bills, credit, and
mortgages. Rather than displacing banks, stablecoins can discipline
banks into paying better rates and improving efficiency, expanding
lending/intermediation and consumer welfare. The GENIUS Act addresses
run/liquidity risk by requiring stablecoins to be fully backed by
cash, short-term Treasuries, or insured deposits, with operational
details left to regulators. The upside case is payments plumbing
because stablecoins enable 24/7 atomic settlement, reducing
cross-border delays and “trapped” liquidity. 

 THE RAMPING BOTTLENECK (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Stablecoin ramps are the real adoption bottleneck as bank-funded
ramping in the US/EU/UK can cost 0-0.3%, while parts of Africa can hit
15–20%. Global card on-ramp completion is ~21% (Africa ~6% and Asia
~7%), and cards are structurally mispriced for stablecoins because
there's no product margin to hide MDR/chargeback risk.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BEWARE THE LOFTY PROMISES OF TRADFI FIRMS EMBRACING TOKENIZATION (10
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 TradFi's tokenization press releases hype 24/7 settlement and
programmability, but they largely ignore the existential risk that
permissionless onchain rails pose to their incumbent moats. These
firms can't get the upside without meaningful cannibalization and
mistakes along the way. If these firms fail, they'll use adoption
carrots and regulatory sticks to push crypto toward permissioned,
captured “crypto-like” systems. 

 AAVE WILL WIN: 2026 MASTER PLAN (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Aave's 2026 strategy prioritizes three pillars: Aave V4
(hub-and-spoke liquidity to unify pools and bootstrap new markets),
Horizon (institutional RWA lending market targeting the “next
trillion” in assets), and the Aave App (consumer fintech-style UX
plus “Push” zero-fee on/off-ramp to drive the first million
users). Aave has historically done $3.33T in cumulative deposits and
originated ~$963B in loans. It had a peak of $75B net deposits, has
59% DeFi lending share, and does $885M in annual fees.

QUICK LINKS

 COW SWAP VOLUME MUCH BIGGER THAN POLYMARKET, BUT VALUATION IS FLIPPED
(1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Regular trading processes much more volume than prediction markets. 

 DAO CONTROL OVER AAVE IS A MISTAKE (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Increasing DAO control over Aave risks slowing decision-making and
weakening execution, because “when everyone has control, no one
really does.” 

 ETHEREUM ACTIVE USERS BACK NEAR ALL-TIME HIGHS (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Ethereum weekly active users are back near ATHs at ~2.4M unique
active addresses/week. 

 AQUA BY 1INCH: SHARED, SELF-CUSTODIAL LIQUIDITY (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Aqua has proposed a DeFi liquidity model where assets stay in the
user's wallet and strategies get conditional access via smart
contracts, meaning tokens only move during an actual swap or
settlement.
