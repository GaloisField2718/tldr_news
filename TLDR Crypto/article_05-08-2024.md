 CFTC SUBPOENAS BEN â€˜BITBOY' ARMSTRONG'S FORMER COMPANY IN FRAUD
INVESTIGATION (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The CFTC has subpoenaed Hit Network, a crypto-focused media company
that previously had Ben 'BitBoy' Armstrong as its public face. It has
requested information about trading activity and wallets associated
with 15 tokens featured in the company's media content, some that were
in videos speculating about 100x returns. Armstrong, who was forcibly
removed from the company after legal issues, "could not be more happy
about" the subpoena.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 A NEW INTERNATIONAL MONEY: ORE V2 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ORE is a Solana-based token that uses a CPU-friendly proof-of-work
mining mechanism. Its v2 update will introduce ORE staking to boost
mining rewards and change the algorithm so that mobile phones can
mine. With a total supply of 21 million, Ore is similar to Bitcoin and
could ultimately become the BTC of Solana if its high early inflation
does not hinder adoption. 

 INTRODUCING LAVA PUBLIC MAINNET (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Lava is creating a modular and decentralized RPC infrastructure layer
for all blockchains. RPC providers can stake LAVA on a Cosmos-based
chain and earn incentives from any chains they support. The LAVA token
is launching DEX-first with high float and a market-derived FDV,
contrary to the "low float, high FDV" meta.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 EXPLORING AI X CRYPTO (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI x Crypto primarily focuses on decentralized compute networks,
model coordination platforms, AI tools and services, and applications.
AI agents are becoming an increasingly popular way to seamlessly
interact with onchain protocols and open-source AI coordination is
fostering greater innovation and development into model training. Over
$230 million was invested in the space in July alone. 

 AVOIDING TOKEN RUG PULLS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Scammers manipulate DEX Screener's Trending tokens by using wash
trading to inflate the number of holders and trading volume, which
makes these tokens seem legitimate. For example, the $FWILLY token
scam involved distributing supply across multiple wallets and
manipulating transaction data before ultimately rugging token holders,
where the developers withdrew all liquidity, leaving holders with
worthless tokens.

 A DEEP DIVE INTO POLYMARKET GROWTH (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 While a large portion of Polymarket's growth this year can be

initially traded in election-related markets, there has been a 391%
YTD growth in volume across various other markets, indicating consumer
interest beyond political events.
