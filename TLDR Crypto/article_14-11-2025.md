MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN FALLS BELOW $100K AMID $463M IN LIQUIDATIONS (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Bitcoin dropped to about $98,842 for the third time this month as
total crypto liquidations hit $463 million, including $342 million
from longs, with spot BTC ETFs seeing $278 million in outflows.
JPMorgan estimates a production‑cost support near $94,000 after
difficulty rose, majors like ETH and SOL fell around 6%, and a delayed
CPI plus lower odds of a December rate cut added FOMC uncertainty. 

 ANT-BACKED R25 LAUNCHES YIELD-BEARING STABLECOIN ON POLYGON (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 R25, incubated by Ant Financial, has launched rcUSD+, a
dollar‑pegged stablecoin that pays yield from money market funds and
structured notes on Polygon, touting layered credit enhancements and
DeFi composability. Analysts say yield‑bearing stables could help
close crypto's yield gap with traditional finance amid accelerating
RWA adoption.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 EIGENZERO: THE CRYPTOECONOMIC DECENTRALIZED VERIFIER NETWORK (6
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 LayerZero and EigenCloud launched EigenZero, the first CryptoEconomic
DVN Framework implementation, which added a slashable stake backed by
$5 million in ZRO tokens to cross-chain message verification through
an 11-day optimistic challenge period. The framework enables
applications to select verifiers based on quantifiable economic
guarantees rather than reputation alone, with EigenCloud's slashing
infrastructure penalizing misbehavior onchain. Applications can now
combine technical verification like ZK proofs with economic
deterrence, while any token project can launch cryptoeconomic DVNs
using native tokens as stake, creating aligned incentives between
verifiers and communities across LayerZero's 600+ application
ecosystem. 

 CASH APP ENABLES STABLECOIN AND LIGHTNING PAYMENTS (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Cash App rolled out a bundled update that adds stablecoin transfers
and Bitcoin payments, including Lightning payments funded directly
from USD balances. Square merchants can choose USD or BTC settlement
in either direction. The platform is now positioned for fast, low-cost
crypto payments as stablecoin adoption hits all-time highs.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE TRUSTLESS MANIFESTO (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethereum's decentralization erodes through convenience as hosted
RPCs, centralized sequencers, and upgrade keys create dependence on
intermediaries most users cannot realistically replace. The manifesto
defines trustlessness through three laws: no critical secrets held by
single actors, no indispensable intermediaries that only specialists
can run, and no unverifiable outcomes hidden from public data.
Builders must reject systems requiring faith in intermediaries and
measure success by trust reduced per transaction rather than
throughput. 

 METADEX03, THE FUTURE OF ONCHAIN EXCHANGE INFRASTRUCTURE (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Metadex03 is the next evolution of AerodromeFi. It introduces a
complete architectural overhaul for onchain trading and revenue
distribution. The new REV Engine adds five new income streams,
including cross-chain bridging and DEX aggregation, boosting protocol
revenue by 40%. The AER Engine optimizes LP rewards in real time,
cutting emissions by 25% and delivering 2.8x more value to token
operators. With the launch of Aero Network (targeting $75B TVL) and a
Momentum Fund for countercyclical buybacks and burns, all liquidity,
volume, and revenue across Aerodrome and Velodrome will flow into a
single unified token, $AERO, making it the core liquidity layer of the
EVM ecosystem.

 DEX WASH TRADING (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Wash trading inflates DEX volumes significantly, with Uniswap's
GOLDEN-WETH pool showing $5 billion in November volume from just 14
traders, including one address responsible for $1.8 billion on a
single day. Zero protocol fees previously allowed LPs to trade their
own pools without capital leakage, but Uniswap's fee switch will force
wash traders to migrate as value now flows to the protocol. Filtering
wash trading and memecoin pools reduces Uniswap Ethereum's projected
30-day revenue from inflated figures to around $6 million, with actual
buyback execution expected to reveal a stark gap between reported pool
accrual and genuine value capture. 

 CIRCLE LOCKUP ENDS: WINNERS, LOSERS, AND 2026 M&A ODDS (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 With Circle's employee lockup ending, IPO investors and bankers are
the clear winners, employees and long‑term holders are largely
neutral as the price drifts back to its natural level, and retail and
the company lose out. While earnings and lower rates suggest
near‑term pressure, Circle's position as the No. 2 stablecoin issuer
gives it M&A appeal that could lift shares in 2026 with roughly 50/50
odds of being acquired by a player like Coinbase, Robinhood, a large
bank, or Visa/Mastercard.
