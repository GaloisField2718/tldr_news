 A REVIEW ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE 'TRENCHES' (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Despite earlier claims that memecoins were “dead,” Solana
memecoin trading remains active, with Pumpdotfun generating
$1.5M–$2M in daily volume. Around 150,000 wallets engage in daily
memecoin trading, with 20,000–40,000 token launches and a graduation
rate of 0.4–0.8%. Combined, major terminals facilitate over $100M in
daily volume and 1–2 million transactions. Pumpswap, Pumpdotfun's
native AMM, generated $25M in fees in its first month. 

 WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REVOLUTION? (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The original promise of cryptocurrency—financial sovereignty—has
been eclipsed by an emphasis on infrastructure over native monetary
design. DeFi has gravitated toward dollar-denominated stablecoins and
institutional adoption. Lacking mechanisms for supply, stability, and
credit management, tokens like BTC and ETH have ceded ground to
traditional financial models. Layer-1 tokens are increasingly
commoditized, risking long-term value erosion. Reviving the crypto
revolution requires building tokens with complete monetary systems
rather than simply creating better rails for existing money.

 STABLECOINS ARE SPEEDRUNNING COMMODITIZATION (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stablecoins are rapidly becoming commoditized utilities as issuers
compete to distribute yield to users and incentivize partners. Leading
players like Tether—backed by deep liquidity—are expected to pass
on yields as competitive pressure increases. Meanwhile,
payment-optimized chains will generate returns through validator fees
and custom protocols. Over time, apps and exchanges will abstract
stablecoins under a “USD” label, auto-routing funds to the
best-yielding source. As platforms evolve into full-service payment
providers, they are expected to internalize margins and capture more
global payment volume. 

 3 MONTHS AFTER MAINNET: WHERE ABSTRACT STANDS TODAY (6 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Abstract, a consumer-focused Layer 2, has onboarded 1.31 million
unique wallets, processed 51.3 million transactions, and secured
$46.66 million in Total Value Locked. With 500–700k daily
transactions and 50–100k daily active wallets, Abstract issues each
user a smart-contract wallet and offers a Consumer Portal with
streaming, swaps, quests, and discovery tools. Its vertically
integrated design—eliminating MetaMask, seed phrases, and gas
fees—creates a self-reinforcing flywheel of adoption and engagement.
