MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SOUTH KOREA'S CENTRAL BANK TO 'ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE' IN STABLECOIN
LEGISLATION (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 South Korea's central bank plans to participate in the development of
stablecoin legislation, aiming to mitigate potential risks to the
nation's monetary and financial stability. The government views them
as inherently different from general digital assets, and thus require
unique considerations. This move reflects the bank's commitment to
ensuring a secure and regulated environment for digital assets. 

 CRYPTO EXCHANGE VOLUME FALLS TO 6-MONTH LOW AS TRADERS FLEE SPOT FOR
FUTURES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Crypto exchange volumes have dropped to six-month lows, with both
centralized and decentralized platforms seeing less activity and spot
trading for BTC and ETH hitting their lowest ratios relative to
futures since August and December 2024. This shift reflects a move
toward more speculative, leveraged futures trading over direct spot
demand, while Solana has seen a slight rebound in volume and
outperformed Ethereum in recent app revenue.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 CIRCLE TO LAUNCH NEW PAYMENTS AND REMITTANCE NETWORK (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Circle is unveiling a new payments and cross-border remittance
network for its $60 billion USDC stablecoin. It will target banks,
PSPs, fintechs, and remittance partners. The network aims to rival
traditional rails like Mastercard and Visa using stablecoins for
global money transfers. Circle is going back to its payment roots
following a postponed IPO amid choppy market conditions. 

 ZORA TOKEN AND TOKENOMICS INFO (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The long-anticipated ZORA token will be released on April 23,
following a strong increase in volume and activity due to the Base
contentcoin narrative. There are two snapshots, one for the past five
years and one for the past month. 10% of the token will be distributed
in an airdrop. The coin will have no governance value or utility.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 LIMITATIONS OF STABLECOINS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stablecoins like USDC can be powerful for certain use cases, but for
everyday remittances like sending money to a cousin in rural India,
they're currently less practical than services like Wise, which offer
instant, seamless fiat transfers with fewer hurdles. While stables
shine for large business payments or users already familiar with
crypto, their effectiveness is limited without efficient on/off-ramps
and widespread local adoption. 

 THE NEXT CRYPTO AI META (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto AI has underperformed amid broader market risk-off trends,
with the sector market cap down to around $6 billion from a high of
$25 billion. The highest asymmetric returns are likely at the nexus of
decentralized AI infrastructure (DeAI) and AI agent distribution
networks, rather than standalone agent frameworks or yield strategies.
Compelling opportunities include distribution hubs like Virtuals that
capture trading fees and community-first infrastructure ecosystems
like Bittensor. The investment thesis emphasizes backing teams that
merge DeAI with GTM-savvy agent builders. 

ðŸ¦„ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 ARGUMENT FOR STABLECOIN USAGE (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 While Wise enables two-way payments in around 17 countries,
stablecoins are increasingly being used in many others that Wise
doesn't support, like Nigeria, Turkey, and Argentina. Companies like
Acctual are making stablecoins usable for businesses where traditional
rails fall short by building tools like accounts payable/accounts
receivable automation and accounting around stablecoins. 

 RESPONSE TO VITALIK'S EVM TO RISC-V VM PROPOSAL (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Relying on a RISC-V zk-VM still demands EVM precompiles for heavy
opcodes, so any change in base-layer cryptography triggers new audited
circuits and undercuts maintainability. Claimed prover speed gains
overlook additional overhead required unless contracts are fully
compiled with specialized data types. Designing a minimal,
proof-friendly architecture allows native execution of compiled
contracts and achieves better balance of maintenance simplicity and
prover efficiency than retrofitting general-purpose RISC-V.
