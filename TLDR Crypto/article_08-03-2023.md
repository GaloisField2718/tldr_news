CIRCLE DROPPED AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE PAYMENTS: DAPPER LABS (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://blockworks.co/news/circle-dapper-labs-automated-clearing-house?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


On Monday, Dapper Labs reported it could no longer process ACH
payments due to its payment partner, Circle. Later, Dapper Labs
announced in its Discord that Circle had decided ‚Äúeffective
immediately‚Äù to stop processing ACH payments for all of its partner
companies. This decision leaves Dapper Labs and other companies using
Circle with one less on and off ramp solution for their customers,
forcing their customers to use wire transfer or USDC to withdraw from
the platform or credit cards, debit cards, and crypto to purchase
items on the platform. It‚Äôs unclear what might have caused Circle to
take this action, but it comes amidst a time of intense scrutiny on
stablecoins. 

GRAYSCALE PRODUCTS BUOYED FOLLOWING ORAL ARGUMENTS IN CASE AGAINST THE
SEC (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theblock.co/post/217787/grayscale-products-buoyed-following-oral-arguments-in-case-against-the-sec?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Oral arguments in Grayscale's appeal against the SEC concluded today
and shares of GBTC and ETHE traded up around 5% and 6% respectively,
despite trading in broader crypto markets being flat, indicating the
markets saw the arguments as going in Grayscale's favor. Don Verrilli,
Grayscale's lead counsel, laid out his arguments as expected and
received questions from the judges. Emily Parise, SEC senior counsel,
faced early roadblocks as Judge Rao questioned the regulator's
argument. The SEC appeared "a bit rattled" as Judge Rao asked
questions regarding the relationship between bitcoin futures and the
spot price.

THE INTEROPERABILITY THESIS: CONNECTING THE ARCHIPELAGO OF BLOCKCHAINS
(7 MINUTE READ)
[https://medium.com/rokcapital/the-interoperability-thesis-connecting-the-archipelago-of-blockchains-53be1522c886?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Throughout the last bull market, new L1s and L2s proliferated as
developers and users sought an alternative to the increasingly high
gas fees on Ethereum. We saw chains like Solana, Avalanche, BSC, and
others gain share due in part to their speed and fee advantages. This
led to a fragmentation of liquidity amongst chains and created a
cumbersome user experience moving from chain to chain. This UX drove
innovation in cross-chain messaging seeking better solutions for
interoperability. This article dives into some of these cross-chain
messaging techniques, their similarities and differences, and the
overall thesis for interoperability and connecting chains and their
liquidity.

CRYPTO STARTUPS, BEWARE THE 'DRY POWDER FALLACY' (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theblock.co/post/217264/crypto-startups-beware-dry-powder-fallacy?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Crypto venture funds raised more than $99 billion last year, seemingly
leading to an abundance of dry powder as top tier firms like Haun
Ventures, a16z and BlockTower have deployed less than 50% of their
multi-million or billion-dollar funds. However, veteran venture
capitalists are warning founders not to fall for "the dry powder
fallacy". Factors such as limited partner capital calls and changes in
valuations of paper wealth investments could reduce the overall
reserves. Ultimately, while dry powder is a directional indicator, it
is essential to understand that dry powder is not a static or absolute
measure, and it does not guarantee that funds must deploy this
‚Äúremaining‚Äù capital.

Tensor, a relatively small player in the Solana NFT marketplace wars,
is quickly gaining market share with a tactic taken from Blur's
playbook, offering rewards in proportion to trading activity on the
blockchain network and 'loyalty' rewards for using its marketplace. It
saw a surge in trading volume on Monday and announced that it had
raised a $3 million seed round. The platform is built around automated
market makers and offers a pro trader interface. It has launched a
second season airdrop that rewards trading activity on its platform
with a loyalty metric and points leaderboard to gamify the trading
experience.
