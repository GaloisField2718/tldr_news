(2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theblock.co/post/254141/opensea-makes-it-easier-for-anyone-to-mint-nfts-with-its-no-code-hub?utm_source=tldrcrypto]

OpenSea, once the largest NFT marketplace in the crypto ecosystem, has
faced challenging times after being unseated by rival marketplace Blur
last year. In addition to dwindling secondary trading volume, the
company has also seen diminished usage of its minting feature over
time. In response to this and the success of other minting platforms
like Zora, OpenSea has launched a ‚Äúno-code‚Äù studio, enabling
creators to set up and drop an NFT collection on their choice of
supported chains without any technical experience or third-party
assistance.

most loyal patrons via paid memberships, merch, and earned perks. The
company is incorporating crypto into the platform with its own
cryptocurrency that can be used to buy items from participating
restaurants. Only a few months in, Blackbird is off to a hot start: it
has raised a total of $35m, put together a team of 20 employees, and
has signed 80 restaurants onto the platform.

[https://mirror.xyz/1kx.eth/9lMkZYQgrO2G6ei2dQFU6RmulsPHuVxQETK3fATtd9o?utm_source=tldrcrypto]

NFTs as we know them have mostly been static collectors‚Äô items, but
developers are beginning to experiment with NFTs whose properties can
change. Called Dynamic NFTs, they rely on algorithmic or user-based
input to change. Their potential uses range from gaming and art to
avatar creation and brand engagement. However, questions of practical
implementation remain. 

INTRO TO ORACLE MULTICALLS (7 MINUTE READ)

Synthetix's Perps V3 Testnet Competition, currently underway, is not
only testing features of the perpetual futures market but also a new
pattern for consuming oracle data, ERC-7412. This pattern creates a
pull oracle system that allows secure, signed, off-chain data to be
consumed on-demand for time-sensitive operations like trade prices.
Some technical considerations are still being ironed out. This blog
post walks through what price oracles are, some of the precursors to
this new standard, and how this new standard works.

MONOLITHIC VS MODULAR BLOCKCHAINS: THE TWIN SUNS THESIS (8 MINUTE
READ)
[https://nosleep.substack.com/p/monolithic-vs-modular-blockchains?utm_source=tldrcrypto]

This article explores the ongoing debate on monolithic versus modular
blockchain technologies. Both technologies will likely find success,
offering different benefits for various uses. Monolithic chains will
be suitable for universal applications and attract users with in-built
features and cheaper costs. On the other hand, modular chains provide
more control and customization, likely attracting 'superapps'. This
could mean there could be one dominant monolithic chain for general
use and an interoperable ecosystem of modular chains for specific use
cases.
