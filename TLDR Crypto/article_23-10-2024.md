 GARY GENSLER'S CONTENTIOUS REIGN OVER CRYPTO APPROACHES ITS TWILIGHT
(12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 SEC Chair Gary Gensler's controversial oversight of the crypto
industry is nearly over. He will likely depart following the 2024
presidential election, though he could technically remain as
commissioner until 2026. His tenure has been marked by aggressive
enforcement actions, including a House-passed bill for digital asset
regulations, and resistance to crypto-specific rulemaking leading to
court battles and congressional pushback. Gensler's remaining agenda
includes potentially finalizing crypto exchange and custody rules. His
successor's approach will likely depend on the election outcome.

 CHAINLINK ANNOUNCES PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Chainlink has introduced CCIP Private Transactions, allowing
financial institutions to securely connect private blockchains to the
multi-chain economy while maintaining data privacy. Australia and New
Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) will pilot this capability for cross-chain
settlement of tokenized real-world assets under Singapore's Project
Guardian to demonstrate the potential for end-to-end privacy between
blockchain networks. 

 WORLD'S FIRST ZK-BACKED DIGITAL IDENTITY LAUNCHED IN BUENOS AIRES FOR
3.6M ELIGIBLE CITIZENS (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Buenos Aires has launched the world's first ZK-backed digital
identity, successfully granting 3.6M citizens access to government
services and the ability to verify credentials without exposing
personal data, thanks to blockchain and zero-knowledge(zk)
cryptography. By integrating QuarkID into the miBA platform, a digital
platform for accessing government docs, residents now gain
self-sovereign control over their digital identities, with the
government no longer having visibility into how or when these
identities are used.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AS STABLECOINS GAIN TRACTION, WHAT'S NEXT FOR CRYPTO'S 'KILLER USE
CASE?' (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stablecoins have become a dominant use case in crypto ($177B market
cap and ~$5.1T in transactions in H1 24), rivaling traditional payment
systems like Visa. They offer investment opportunities through public
companies, potential competition with money market accounts, and may
drive the growth of blockchain networks like Ethereum. 

 HOW BLOCKCHAIN CAN HELP FIGHT FAKE AI (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Blockchain-based identity platforms like Civic and Worldcoin are
potential solutions for verifying human authenticity online. These
systems combine biometrics, zero-knowledge proofs, and other
cryptographic methods to prevent Sybil attacks in token airdrops and
facilitate proof of humanity. While privacy concerns around biometric
collection remain prevalent, client-side storage and consent-based
access address these issues.

API platform, as a “crypto native American Express” that enables
users to transact across any chain while settling in their preferred
currency. It acknowledges the team's exceptional background and the

MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Sky, formerly known as MakerDAO, is considering a return to its old
branding after a token migration in September. Founder Rune
Christensen presented three options for the protocol: stay as Sky,
return to the original Maker vision, or rebrand to Maker but make
small changes to the new USDS stablecoin and foster better subDAO
alignment. Though there are concerns about SKY's utility, the USDS
stablecoin has achieved over 1 billion in total supply and
integrations with DeFi protocols like Aave.
