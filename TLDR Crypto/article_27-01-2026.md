MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN SLIPS AS US SHUTDOWN FEARS TRIGGER RISK-OFF MOVE (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin fell near $87,000 as rising fears of a potential US
government shutdown pushed investors into a broader risk-off stance,
weighing on crypto alongside traditional markets. Analysts point to
political deadlock, increasing shutdown probabilities on Polymarket,
and the worst week of US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows since February as
signs that macro uncertainty, not crypto-specific factors, is driving
near-term price pressure. 

 SOUTH KOREA'S COINONE IN TALKS TO SELL (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Coinone, South Korea's third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, is
exploring the sale of shares held by Chairman Cha Myung-hoon, who
controls a 53.4% stake, as the exchange faces financial pressure with
its book value declining to approximately 75.2 billion won ($52.2
million) from a previous 94.4 billion won valuation. The exchange is
in talks with major overseas crypto exchanges and local financial
institutions. Industry sources suggest Coinbase may participate in the
sale. Coinbase executives are scheduled to visit South Korea this week
to meet with Coinone and other local firms, though discussions remain
preliminary.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 A POST-QUANTUM ROADMAP FOR THE SUPERCHAIN (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OP Labs plans to deprecate ECDSA-based EOAs across OP Mainnet and the
Superchain by January 2036, requiring all accounts to delegate key
management to post-quantum smart contract accounts via EIP-7702. The
migration leverages account abstraction to transition signing
authority from ECDSA to post-quantum signatures. The specific
cryptographic scheme remains undecided as NIST-standardized
lattice-based options may not prove optimal long-term. OP Labs is
coordinating with the Ethereum Foundation on broader
quantum-resistance efforts, including migrating validators from BLS
signatures and KZG commitments to post-quantum algorithms. 

 BULK TRADE: THE EVERYTHING EXCHANGE FOR SOLANA (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bulk is building a professional-grade perpetuals exchange on Solana
by embedding a high-performance matching engine directly into the
validator set via a Jito-Agave fork, enabling orders to bypass the
standard transaction queue and match asynchronously at 20ms intervals
while settling on-chain each block. The architecture uses BULK Net for
stake-weighted order propagation and BULK Db for replicated state
storage, eliminating mempool uncertainty and phantom liquidity issues
that plague current Solana perps venues, which refresh prices every
400ms. Validators running Bulk-Agave earn a portion of taker fees
(estimated 1-2% APY boost), designed to leverage Solana's upcoming
Alpenglow upgrade that reduces finality from 12.8s to 150ms.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 FARCASTER AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF RISK-FREE AMBITION (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Farcaster's founders are stepping down after raising $180M, with the
protocol being acquired and investors receiving a full 100% refund –
an outcome made possible because the team preserved the entire
principal in Treasury bills, yielding ~4% APY and funded operations
entirely from interest income. The structure functioned as a capital
deposit model where investors received tokens at a set valuation with
downside protection through an onchain redemption right to reclaim
original principal at any time. This approach mirrors other "High
Interest Rate Phenomena" like ConstitutionDAO's risk-free vehicle and
Andre Cronje's Flying Tulip ($200M raised with redeemable treasury),
all dependent on material yield environments. 

 THE BULL CASE FOR ON-CHAIN LENDING (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 On-chain lending protocols are experiencing a cyclical downturn as
capital exits due to rates falling, driven by weak borrow demand and
structural inefficiencies like cash drag and rehypothecation
restrictions. The sector is positioned for growth through
institutional-grade collateral integration, protocol upgrades enabling
fixed-term loans and whitelisting, and high-yield tokenized products
like Figure's 8% HELOC offerings. Despite bearish conditions, the
sector trades at 21x-42x P/S versus 8.4x for traditional fintech
lenders, though multiples are compressing as token prices decline
while protocol fundamentals strengthen.

 ETH LOOKS UNIQUELY POSITIONED MACRO-WISE (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ETH's roadmap on quantum resistance, lower net inflation, separation
from power-hungry AI infrastructure, and upside from potential fee
burn driven by stablecoins and tokenized assets combine to create a
rare long-term store-of-value and macro optionality. 

 VITALIK REFRAMES THE “MOUNTAIN MAN” ARGUMENT FOR ETHEREUM (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vitalik Buterin no longer fully agrees with his 2017 stance against
“mountain man” style blockchains, arguing that advances like
ZK-SNARKs now allow users to verify chain correctness without
re-executing all history, changing earlier tradeoffs around state and
scalability. He also reflects on real-world failure modes like
outages, censorship, concentration, and service shutdowns, concluding
that Ethereum must preserve the ability for users to independently
fall back to self-sovereign verification as a last-resort option, not
a default lifestyle, to keep power decentralized over the long term.
