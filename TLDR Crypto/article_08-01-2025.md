 CZECH NATIONAL BANK GOVERNOR WEIGHS BITCOIN FOR FUTURE RESERVE
STRATEGY (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Czech National Bank Governor AleÅ¡ Michl has expressed interest in
using Bitcoin for diversification as part of the national bank's
future reserve strategy. Globally, Bitcoin's rising appeal as a
reserve asset, supported by initiatives like the U.S. Bitcoin Act,
highlights its growing role in national financial strategies despite
concerns over volatility.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PROMPT-TO-EARN (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 BrainKnowsAI is launching a prompt-to-earn program to support the
development of its Web3-centric LLM and intent recognition system,
which is designed to process and execute onchain transactions through
natural language inputs. The platform's architecture consists of an
Intent Recognition Engine that interprets user requests and an
Execution Engine that performs actions through offchain tools and
onchain aggregators. It aims to differentiate itself by creating a
domain-specific model, focusing on accurate intent recognition.
BrainKnowsAI will release open-weight models for developers. 

 DEFAI IS THE NEW DEFI (9 MINUTE READ) [7]

layers for simplified user interactions, autonomous trading agents
with advanced decision-making capabilities, and AI-powered dapps built
on specialized infrastructure. Notable projects include Griffain and
Neur for abstraction layers and Almanak and Cod3x for autonomous
trading. The Mode Network is emerging as a significant Layer 2
ecosystem for AI-powered DeFi applications. The sector is seeing rapid
development in infrastructure components like Trusted Execution
Environments (TEEs) and verification frameworks, with projects like
Phala Network and Hyperbolic Labs leading development in secure and
verifiable AI agent execution.

 This article explains how cryptocurrencies streamline international
money transfers by reducing fees, eliminating intermediaries, and
offering faster transactions. It covers practical steps, platforms,
and tips for secure transfers while highlighting crypto's advantages
in overcoming traditional banking hurdles, especially in underserved

 ON LOWERING YOUR CRYPTO IQ (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The crypto market requires traders to balance past experience with
adaptability, as demonstrated by the contrast between 2017-era traders
who developed skeptical habits from choppy markets and newer traders
who navigated 2021 with ease. While adopting a simpler trading
approach may help adapt to new conditions, the ideal strategy combines
first-cycle traders' willingness to capture upside with multi-cycle
traders' risk management. Success requires both the ability to update
trading frameworks and recognize market shifts.
