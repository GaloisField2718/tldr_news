MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC APPROVES GRAYSCALE'S MIXED CRYPTO FUND (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The SEC granted accelerated approval for the conversion of
Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund LLC into an exchange-traded fund,
marking the first mixed‐crypto ETF to clear US regulatory hurdles.
The fund's holdings are dominated by bitcoin (~80%) and Ethereum
(~11%), with smaller allocations to Solana, Cardano, and XRP.
Regulators are now evaluating standalone spot ETFs for assets like
SOL, DOGE, ADA, and XRP. Market observers see the GDLC approval as a
“test run” that could smooth the path for these individual
products. 

 FIGMA HOLDS $70 MILLION BTC IN CORPORATE TREASURY (4 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Figma's S-1 IPO filing reveals the company holds $70 million in
Bitcoin ETFs and that its board has approved up to $30 million in
additional Bitcoin purchases using USDC, bringing its total treasury
allocation to $100 million. Before Figma's IPO filing, it was not
known that it held any digital assets. Figma's decision may signal
confidence in crypto as a hedge and value store for innovative
software businesses.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 VISUAL GUIDE TO VOLUME PROFILE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Point of Control (POC) is the price level with the most traded
volume and acts as a key support or resistance. High Value Nodes
(HVNs) attract price and act as resistance in ranges, while Low Value
Nodes (LVNs) act as fast-pass zones where price moves quickly. The
Value Area (VA) covers 70% of traded volume between the VAH and VAL.
Repeated closes outside it can signal a breakout. Drawing volume
profiles around ranges and expansions helps traders anticipate
reactions to past volume levels. 

 WHY ARE BITCOIN TREASURY COMPANIES TRADING AT HIGH PREMIUMS? (12
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Bitcoin treasury companies trade at significant premiums to NAV by
using public capital markets, particularly at-the-market equity
issuances, to increase BTC-per-share and amplify exposure. Major
players like MicroStrategy trade at roughly a 75% premium, while
smaller firms such as The Blockchain Group and Metaplanet sport
premiums of 217% and 384%, reflecting the value investors place on
future BTC accumulation and narrative. A key driver is “bitcoin
yield,” which measures BTC growth per diluted share, and transparent
proof-of-reserves practices further bolster confidence. However, this
model depends on sustaining premiums: if share prices fall to NAV,
equity raises become dilutive rather than accretive, breaking the
self-reinforcing capital-raise/accumulation cycle.
