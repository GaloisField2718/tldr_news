 DEEP DIVE INTO BINANCE‚ÄôS RECENT STRUGGLES (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Binance is struggling with regulatory issues as multiple countries,
including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Nigeria, have taken
legal action against the exchange for operating without proper
authorization. The Nigerian complaint, centered on allegations of
money laundering and financial instability, escalated with the
detention and escape of a Binance executive. This regulatory scrutiny
highlights a pattern of Binance prioritizing expansion over adherence
to security and compliance standards, which could lead to increased
legal challenges and a push for tighter regulations on crypto
exchanges. 

 MAKERDAO PROPOSES ALLOCATING $600 MILLION WORTH OF DAI INTO USDE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DAI-issuer MakerDAO is considering adding $600 million DAI into
Ethena‚Äôs yield-bearing USDe and sUSDe stablecoins via the Morpho
lending protocol. It added an initial $100 million on March 29th,
enhancing DAI yields with USDe‚Äôs funding rate arbitrage strategy.
Some DAO members are hesitant to ramp up Maker‚Äôs exposure to the
relatively new protocol so quickly, though the proposers maintain that
the risk parameters are acceptably low.

 REWARD CURVE WITH TEMPERED ISSUANCE: EIP RESEARCH POST (22 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Ethereum researcher Anders Elowsson outlines the reasoning behind
moderating Ethereum staking reward issuance. The idea is to use a
curve that gradually decreases staking rewards as the amount of staked
ETH increases beyond what is seen as a sufficient level. Though it may
seem controversial, the argument is that Ethereum only needs so much
security before paying validators becomes redundant. Elowsson argues
there should be more non-staked than staked ETH to ensure the network
stays neutral. 

 BSX, A CLOB PERP EXCHANGE LAUNCHES ON BASE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 BSX is a trading platform for highly liquid perps. It aims to offer
DeFi traders a CEX-like trading experience with instant execution,
transparent pricing, and liquidity. The platform is advised by Arthur
Hayes, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX.

 VERIFIABLE COMPUTING NARRATIVE EXPLAINED (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This thread explains the premise of verifiable computing and compares
it to a GPU for smart contracts. Verifiable computing enables the
execution of complex tasks like computing ML models while retaining
the benefits of trustless execution that blockchain provides. There
are two approaches: the first uses a network of nodes to perform an
off-chain computation and prove it on-chain using zero knowledge
proofs, while the second is to build specific ZK coprocessor hardware
that can efficiently handle verifiable computation. 

 VITALIK ON NEXT STEPS IN THE PURGE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Vitalik Buterin breaks down the next steps in the ‚ÄúPurge‚Äù ‚Äì the
plan to simplify the Ethereum protocol. The idea of the Purge is to
remove complexity caused by underutilized opcodes and precompiles,
consequently adding security guarantees. One significant upcoming
change is EIP-4444, which removes Ethereum blocks from nodes after a
certain time, similar to blobs today. These upgrades will make client
development easier and node operation more achievable.

 WHY L3S? (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Offchain Labs/Arbitrum co-founder Steven Goldfeder explains the value
of Layer 3s. Layer 3s reduce the onboarding cost compared to L2s since
they do not require L1 bridging transactions or transfers. Similarly,
chain operators have the benefit of significantly lower fixed costs to
post to an L2 like Arbitrum instead of to Ethereum, especially during
times of lower L3 use. This allows L2s like Arbitrum to eventually
become settlement layers for an ecosystem of Layer 3s. 

 POLYGON LABS CEO SAYS L3S TAKE VALUE AWAY FROM ETHEREUM (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron criticizes L3 networks, claiming they
exist mainly to siphon value from Ethereum, jeopardizing its value and
network security. He suggests that if L3 networks consolidate their
transactions onto a single L2 platform, Ethereum may lose transaction
fees, reducing the incentive for validators to secure the network,
potentially devaluing Ether and threatening Ethereum‚Äôs economic
future.

 VITALIK WRITES ABOUT ‚ÄúDEGEN COMMUNISM‚Äù (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 "Degen communism" is a new political ideology that embraces the chaos
and dynamism of markets and social media while tweaking rules to align
outcomes with the common good. 

 THE FIRST DEAL CLOSES ON ECHO, RAISING $300,000 FOR ETHENA (1 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Echo users are now able to create invite-only groups and restrict
deal access to certain members. 

 A SUMMARY OF THE DISCOURSE ON L2S/L3S (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 L3s have similar risks as L2s, which have a single centralized
sequencer that is able to censor transactions, but they sit on top of
an L2, whereas L2s sit on a decentralized and censorship-resistant L1.
