 SOLANA TOKEN EXTENSIONS FOR NATIVE SUPPORT FOR ENTERPRISE-GRADE USE
CASES (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Solana has introduced a concept called token extensions, a
development allowing for specialized functions at the token level.

plug-and-play tools are designed to reduce engineering efforts in
tokenizing assets on Solana. Extensions already used by Paxos and GMO
Trust include permanent delegation and metadata pointers for their
stablecoin launches. Tools like these enable streamlined KYC
verification, transferring hooks, transaction fees, and more, boosting
Solana's appeal to developers and businesses alike.

 MINTING IS THE NATIVE BUSINESS MODEL FOR WEB3 (AND MAYBE AI TOO) (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post explains how web3 offers an alternative to Big Tech data
dominance, allowing users to own their data. Platforms like Zora let
users mint digital artwork, paying a small fee to creators. The
collector owns a copy of the work in their portfolio, which in a sense
creates a dataset that they have full control over. This could open up
the potential for those in the space to leverage AI/ML on top of these
open datasets to monetize them further or allow for better discovery
of art and artists. 

 INDEXING CRYPTO TWITTER NARRATIVE MINDSHARE IN 2023 (2 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 This post breaks down what the most popular narratives were on Crypto
Twitter last year. The dominant narrative of 2023 was AI, with almost
a third of the ‚Äòmindshare‚Äô throughout the year. Ordinals, GameFi,
and Layer 2s were all also notable themes last year, with mindshares
in the high single digits. New narratives like ETFs and DePIN gained
momentum in late 2023, while SocialFi had a short surge in August. As
of this month, ETFs remain a focal point, with AI and DePIN also
gaining momentum. On the other hand, GameFi and SocialFi have lost
some mindshare.
