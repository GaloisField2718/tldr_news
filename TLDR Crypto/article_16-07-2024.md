MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Larry Fink stated in an interview with CNBC that while he was
originally a skeptic on Bitcoin, he now believes it is a legitimate
financial instrument. Fink sees it serving a purpose for investors
afraid of currency debasement and as a hedge against government
financial control. Equating it to ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù he believes it
is a hedge against hope with strong industrial use.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GWYNETH ‚Äî A BASED ROLLUP SYNCHRONOUSLY COMPOSABLE WITH ETHEREUM (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gwyneth is a new based rollup, meaning transactions are sequenced by
L1 validators with blocks constructed by L1 builders. It is a
synchronously composable ‚Äúbooster rollup,‚Äù allowing for seamless
access to the L1's state with no fragmentation. Gwyneth was built
using Taiko's prover technology and will eventually utilize zkVMs like
SP1 and Risc0 for transaction execution. 

 THE BULL CASE FOR PENDLE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Pendle has seen extreme growth driven by airdrop points programs, and
boasted an ATH TVL of $6.7B. The much-anticipated V3 upgrade will help
it become the centralized exchange of interest rate derivatives, being
the first of its kind even among traditional finance. With the
interest rate swap market being worth $500 trillion, and blockchain
providing the backbone for trustless, guaranteed swap delivery,
Pendle's TVL could skyrocket. In the short term, permissionless market
listing, new L1 listings, and Bitcoin restaking could usher in new
highs for Pendle.

 A TON OF GAMING HYPE (31 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The TON ecosystem has made significant strides in Web3 gaming, with
highlights like $NOT's impressive fair launch and Hamster Kombat's
rapid user growth. Leveraging Telegram's vast user base and privacy
features, TON is well-positioned to lead Web3 adoption, aided by its
native in-app currency and strong developer support. 

 DEEP DIVE ON POLKADOT (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Polkadot is a decentralized multi-chain network that uses a main
Relay chain that provides security and interoperability to multiple L1
parachains, each customized for specific functions. It supports a
dynamic ecosystem with a capped number of 100 parachains, enabling
specialized apps like privacy, RWAs, and DeFi solutions within its
architecture.

 LENDING AND STABLECOINS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Stablecoin issuers and lending protocols have a symbiotic
relationship that has been increasingly closer aligned. Stablecoin
issuers like MakerDAO are lending protocols through their
collateralization, and lending protocols like Aave are arguably a
specific type of stablecoin issuer. The specialization of lending
protocols has changed the market structure, and stablecoin lenders
will become the primary users of lending platforms. 

 HE WHO OWNS THE CUSTOMER CAPTURES THE VALUE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In traditional markets, the entity in the stack closest to the user
captures most of the value, like Robinhood or retail stores. However,
infrastructure has gotten all the attention and funding in crypto
markets. There are still massive opportunities on the application
layer, but they require a great idea, masterful product design, and
user acquisition.
