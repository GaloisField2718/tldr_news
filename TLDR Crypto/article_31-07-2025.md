MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC APPROVES IN-KIND REDEMPTIONS FOR CRYPTO ETFS (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The SEC has approved in‑kind creation and redemption for all spot
Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, allowing authorized participants to
exchange ETF shares directly for BTC or ETH instead of cash, which
will streamline liquidity management and reduce transaction costs.
This marks the first major crypto‑friendly policy under new Chair
Paul Atkins, who has prioritized a fit‑for‑purpose regulatory
framework for digital assets. BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, and
other issuers stand to benefit, having filed for this change earlier
in the year. The SEC also raised position limits on options for
BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, further enhancing institutional
flexibility for hedging and arbitrage. 

 WHITE HOUSE'S WORKING GROUP RELEASES CRYPTO REPORT (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The White House's President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets
published a 168‑page report endorsing digital assets' potential and
proposing a “regulatory Bible” for crypto, covering banking,
stablecoins, taxes, illicit finance, and a strategic digital asset
stockpile. It urges Congress to affirm self‑custody rights, grant
the CFTC oversight of spot non‑security tokens, and direct the
Treasury to manage a forfeiture‑funded crypto reserve (including
BTC, XRP, SOL, and ADA) without taxpayer cost. The report recommends
federal tax guidance tailored to digital‑asset nuances,
safe‑harbors for DeFi protocols, and a “fit‑for‑purpose” SEC
exemption for token distributions.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 JPMORGAN CHASE PARTNERS WITH COINBASE TO EXPAND CRYPTO ACCESS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 JPMorgan Chase and Coinbase have formed a strategic partnership,
enabling Chase customers to link their bank accounts directly to
Coinbase wallets, transfer Ultimate Rewards points at a 1:1 ratio, and
fund Coinbase via Chase credit cards. The bank‑to‑wallet
integration and points transfer will debut in 2026, while
credit‑card funding is slated for fall 2025. Chase Ultimate Rewards
has become the first major credit‑card rewards program to fund a
crypto wallet. Both firms say the move will lower barriers to entry,
expand consumer choice, and empower customers to manage digital assets
more seamlessly. 

 COINBASE MOBILE WALLET USERS CAN BUY CRYPTO WITH SAMSUNG PAY (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Coinbase's app now lets eligible users buy crypto with Samsung Pay,
eliminating app‑switching and re‑entering payment details. The
feature will roll out to select US and Canadian customers over the
next month, with full availability soon after. This integration
follows Coinbase's PNC Bank partnership and reflects its strategy to
weave digital assets into mainstream payment rails. Industry data
shows mobile wallets power 35% of online and 21% of in‑store
transactions across major markets.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ETHENA X AAVE: LIQUID LEVERAGE STRATEGY EXPLAINED (2 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Ethena's Liquid Leverage flow with Aave lets users boost sUSDe yield
without waiting 7 days to withdraw. Users supply 50% sUSDe and 50%
USDe into Aave's e-mode, borrow USDC, USDT, or USDS, loop it back into
the same position, and qualify for enhanced sUSDe yield (~12% APY
promo). Combined with USDe's 4% base rate, the strategy yields ~14% on
base collateral, scaling to ~49% APR at 5x leverage. Rewards are
distributed every 8–12 hours via Merkl. 

 ROBINHOOD HITS RECORD METRICS ACROSS THE BOARD IN Q2 2025 (2 MINUTE
READ) [9]

customers reaching a record 26.5M (+10% YoY), while platform assets

sweep rose to $33B (+56%), and the margin book jumped 90% to $9.5B.
Equity trading volume hit $517B (+112%), and option contracts
increased 32% to 515M. Despite a dip in net deposit growth, Robinhood
continues to scale aggressively across retail, crypto, and financial
products.

 VISA FLAGS MODEST STABLECOIN UPTAKE IN EARNINGS CALL (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Visa reported $10.17 billion in Q2 revenue, but stablecoin
settlements amounted to just $200 million. CEO Ryan McInerney
emphasized that broader adoption hinges on clearer regulatory
frameworks, even as Visa pilots real‑time cross‑border transfers
via Visa Direct and programmable finance tools on its Tokenized Asset
Platform. The company is also investing in stablecoin infrastructure
through BVNK and partnering with Bridge in Latin America to expand
service offerings. Analysts note that stablecoin payment activity
could exceed 50% within a year as regulations solidify and businesses
increasingly leverage stablecoins for remittances and payroll. 

 ETHEREUM TURNS 10: STILL STANDING, STILL BUILDING (5 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 As Ethereum celebrates its 10th anniversary, community members
reflect on a decade of improbable success, resilience, and
reinvention. From Vitalik Buterin's 2013 whitepaper to a $450 billion
network powering global finance and commerce, Ethereum has evolved
through hacks, hard forks, regulatory attacks, and scaling crises,
without betraying its core values. Kraken's Joseph Delong calls its
uptime and adaptability “unimaginable victories,” while Consensys'
Bill Hughes notes Ethereum could never launch under today's
conditions. With institutions like Sharplink Gaming joining the
ecosystem, the next decade's challenge is maintaining cypherpunk
ideals amid growing mainstream adoption.
