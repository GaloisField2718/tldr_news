MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN SLIPS BELOW $71,000 AS AI-DRIVEN TECH ROUT WORSENS (4 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin fell 7.5% in Asian trading on Thursday, slipping below
$71,000 to lows near $70,700 as a global technology stock selloff
spilled into crypto markets, driven by mounting concerns over peaking
AI investment, stretched valuations, and disappointing earnings from
firms including Alphabet, Qualcomm, and Arm. Analysts noted that the
move below the low-$70,000s has accelerated a broader deleveraging,
flushing out crowded positioning built during the post-ETF rally with
heavy liquidations and price action now driven more by balance-sheet
mechanics than narrative flow, marking the end of complacency rather
than the end of institutional participation. The crypto selloff was
compounded by brutal commodity moves, including silver plunging 17%
and gold falling over 3%, triggering heavy liquidations in tokenized
metals products on crypto venues and highlighting fragile conviction
across risk assets rather than a clear trend reversal. 

 TOM LEE: BITMINE'S $6 BILLION ETHER PAPER LOSS IS “BY DESIGN" (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 BitMine Immersion chairman Tom Lee defended the company's more than
$6 billion in unrealized losses on its 4.24 million ether holdings
(down from nearly $14 billion in October to approximately $9.6
billion), arguing the drawdown reflects the design of its Ethereum
treasury strategy rather than execution failure. Lee positioned
BitMine as structured to track and ultimately outperform ether over a
full market cycle, similar to an index-style product, comparing paper
losses during crypto downturns to market declines in traditional index
funds and questioning why similar scrutiny isn't applied to those
vehicles. The firm has continued accumulating ETH, adding over 40,000
coins shortly before the latest decline, with its strategy centered on
long-term accumulation and staking yield rather than short-term price
timing, mirroring approaches used by bitcoin-focused treasury
companies that view volatility as the cost of maintaining
long-duration core asset exposure.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 Y COMBINATOR STARTUPS NOWABLE TO RECEIVE THEIR FUNDING IN STABLECOINS
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Y Combinator startups can receive their $500,000 funding in USDC
stablecoins instead of cash beginning in Spring 2026. This shift
targets faster, cheaper cross-border transactions. Led by partner
Nemil Dalal, the initiative leverages improved regulatory clarity from
the GENIUS Act to modernize financial infrastructure for founders. 

 AI NEEDS BLOCKCHAINS — ESPECIALLY NOW (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI systems are breaking the human-scale internet by making it
increasingly cheap to generate indistinguishable content and
impersonate humans at scale, creating an urgent need for
blockchain-based infrastructure to separate humans from machines while
preserving privacy and usability. AI needs blockchains for raising the
cost of impersonation through decentralized proof-of-personhood
systems that make it easy to be one participant but persistently hard
to be many (like World ID), creating censorship-resistant
decentralized identity systems where users rather than platform
gatekeepers control access, enabling portable universal "passports"
for AI agents to operate across multiple ecosystems without platform
lock-in, and facilitating machine-scale payments through micropayment
infrastructure and programmable smart contracts that traditional
financial systems cannot handle. Blockchain-based systems paired with
zero-knowledge proofs can enforce privacy by default, allowing users
to prove specific facts (like age eligibility) without revealing
underlying data, solving the paradox where security systems collecting
more data make AI impersonation easier.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHY VISA, MASTERCARD, AND STRIPE AREN'T THREATENED BY CRYPTO (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Traditional payment giants are aggressively acquiring crypto
infrastructure rather than competing against it: Stripe bought Bridge
for $1.1B plus Privy, Visa partnered with Mercuryo for real-time
crypto-to-fiat off-ramping through Visa Direct, and Mastercard pursued
Zerohash for up to $2B alongside exploratory talks with BVNK for
stablecoin payment infrastructure. These acquisitions focus on
embedding blockchain rails into existing PSP stacks and compliance
frameworks rather than launching standalone token networks, with
stablecoins prioritized for instant, predictable value transfer. The
next 18 months are expected to bring surging stablecoin volume,
regulatory clarification, continued M&A activity, and crypto payments
appearing as standard checkout options alongside cards and BNPL. 

 THE PAYMENT LAYER FOR AUTONOMOUS AGENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI agents require new payment infrastructure to execute autonomous
transactions, with incumbent financial institutions competing against
crypto-native stablecoin wallets with programmable spending limits.
Crypto solutions enable micropayments at $0.001-$0.05 per query with
microsecond settlement onchain, positioning them for agent-to-agent
commerce and data marketplaces. The AI agents market is projected to
grow from $7.6B in 2025 to $180B by 2033, with BCG forecasting 45%
annual growth in agentic commerce through 2030.

 L2S NEED A NEW ROLE (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vitalik Buterin says the original rollup-as-branded-shard roadmap no
longer fits. The Ethereum layer 1 is scaling, and many layer 2s (L2s)
won't or can't be true shards, so L2s should pick clear non-scaling
value adds, be at least stage-1 when handling ETH, and maximize
interoperability. Furthermore, Ethereum should add a native rollup
precompile for ZK-EVM proof verification to enable safe, trustless L1
to L2 (and vice versa) interop and synchronous composability. 

 FIXED RATES ARE THE MISSING PIECE FOR INSTITUTIONAL ON-CHAIN CREDIT
(3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 DeFi's money markets currently favor lenders but fail borrowers,
especially institutions, that need predictable, fixed borrowing costs,
which is why fixed-rate capability is the top priority across Morpho,
Kamino, and Euler roadmaps. P2P fixed-rate lending (clean but 1:1
capital-inefficient and liquidity-fragile) and rates markets/swaps
(240–500x more capital efficient by hedging floating exposure into
fixed), and protocols are building both plus hedging tools to avoid
withdrawal/liquidity risks for curators. Together, fixed-rate
primitives and rates markets could unlock institutional credit, RWAs,
and consumer “borrow-and-spend” products onchain, turning existing
lending liquidity into a two-sided, scalable credit market.
