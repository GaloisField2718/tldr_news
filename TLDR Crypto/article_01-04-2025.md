MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CIRCLE INTERNET FINANCIAL TAPS JPMORGAN, CITI FOR DELAYED IPO (1
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Circle Internet Financial, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, is
preparing for an IPO with help from JPMorgan and Citi. It aims to go
public by mid-2025. A previous SPAC attempt fell through. The IPO
would mark one of the biggest crypto-related listings since Coinbase,
though questions remain about Circle's revenue model, which heavily
relies on interest from USDC reserves. 

 BITCOIN MINER MARA EYES $2 BILLION STOCK OFFERING (1 MINUTE READ) [5]


 MARA is planning a $2B stock offering to raise funds to expand its
operations and buy additional Bitcoin. This move is part of its
broader strategy to use public market capital to increase its Bitcoin
holdings and strengthen its balance sheet.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 A SIMPLE L2 SECURITY AND FINALIZATION ROADMAP (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Vitalik Buterin's vision for Ethereum involves advancing L2 security
and finality with expanded blob space targets and new high-quality
zkEVM options for shorter finality times than optimistic rollups. A
proposed 2-of-3 proof system using optimistic, ZK, and TEE-based
provers would deliver instant finality under normal conditions and
trustlessness when proof systems perform as expected. Standardized
proof aggregation layers across Ethereum are required to streamline
costs for various apps and L2s and improve interoperability. 

 PRIVACY POOLS HAS LAUNCHED (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Aiming to "Make Privacy Normal Again," Privacy Pools has officially
launched on Ethereum mainnet, offering users a way to transact
privately while filtering out illicit activity. Backed by figures like
Vitalik Buterin and firms like Bankless Ventures, this compliant,
non-custodial system allows screened ETH deposits of up to 1 ETH, with
user-friendly features like partial withdrawals and a single privacy
seed phrase.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ANATOMY OF A BEAR MARKET (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The crypto market has been leaning bearish, with significant declines
in Bitcoin and altcoins amid broader economic uncertainty. There are
three potential scenarios â€“ a prolonged, choppy downtrend driven by
liquidity constraints and hedging pressures, a rapid collapse
following overextended leveraged positions, or minimal upward momentum
â€“ each with unique risks and opportunities. Disciplined trading,
effective risk management, and capital preservation are critical to
navigating the persistent volatility and uncertainty of the markets. 

 DEMYSTIFYING THE NORTH KOREAN THREAT (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A massive hack on Bybit, initially mistaken for routine maintenance,
turned out to be the largest crypto theft ever. The attack was
attributed to North Korea's highly sophisticated cyber unit, which had
compromised SafeWallet infrastructure to target the exchange. The
article breaks down North Korea's complex cyber apparatus, including
groups like Lazarus, AppleJeus, and TraderTraitor, and offers insights
into their tactics, structure, and how the crypto industry can defend
against them.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY DEPIN MATTERS (21 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DePIN protocols aim to change how we view traditional infrastructure
(e.g., energy, telecom, and storage) by decentralizing control,
reducing capital expenditures, and enabling permissionless innovation,
which can break the grip of inefficient monopolies. To succeed, these
projects must accurately verify physical services and effectively
integrate with existing centralized systems so that the resulting
networks are transparent, competitive, and capable of unlocking new
economic opportunities. 

 UNLEASHING ONCHAIN INTEREST IS A WIN-WIN (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A new push is underway to allow stablecoin holders to earn onchain
interest, letting consumers, not just issuers, benefit from the yield
on U.S. Treasuries that back tokens like USDC. Advocates argue that
enabling this would democratize access to fair market returns, expand
dollar access globally, and strengthen the U.S. economy, all while
modernizing outdated financial laws.

 UNISWAP'S APP STORE RANKING DIVES AS USER ACTIVITY AND TRADING VOLUME
DECLINE (2 MINUTE READ) [13]

using its $11.4B cash reserve. 

 ALTCOINS SEE INFLOWS FOR FIRST TIME IN 5 WEEKS (3 MINUTE READ) [15]

second consecutive week of positive sentiment. 

 JAPAN MULLS OFFICIALLY CLASSIFYING CRYPTO AS FINANCIAL PRODUCT (1
MINUTE READ) [16]

classifying cryptocurrencies as financial products, a move that would
bring digital assets under a formal regulatory framework similar to
traditional securities(e.g., stocks and bonds).
