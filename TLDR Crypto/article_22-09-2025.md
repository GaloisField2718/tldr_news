 DEMOCRATS PUSH FOR BIPARTISAN ROLE IN CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE BILL (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Twelve Senate Democrats, including Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory
Booker, called for a bipartisan authorship process on the Clarity Act,
arguing they should help draft the crypto market structure bill rather
than merely comment on a GOP-led version. Their framework seeks
stronger CFTC authority over spot markets, bans on elected officials
profiting from crypto projects, and expanded funding for regulators. 

 US TREASURY SEEKS COMMENT ON GENIUS ACT STABLECOIN RULES (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The U.S. Treasury Department is inviting public feedback on its
implementation of the GENIUS Act, the first federal crypto-specific
law regulating payment stablecoins. Officials are seeking input on
open questions, including tax treatment, foreign issuer participation,
marketing restrictions, and how to balance state vs. federal oversight
with BSA/AML compliance. Comments close on October 20, as the
department prepares formal regulations following the law's passage
under President Trump this summer.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PROXIMARKET: MAKING PREDICTION MARKETS MORE THAN YES/NO (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Proximarket allows users to bet on markets with more than simple
binary outcomes. It uses embedding models for semantic similarity and
pays out proportional to the accuracy of a user's prediction, making
markets around news headlines, Elon tweets, and future words possible.
It was built in a week and is still in testing stages. 

 ETHEREUM FOUNDATION INTRODUCES DAI TEAM (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Ethereum Foundation's dAI Team aims to make Ethereum the
preferred settlement and coordination layer for AIs and the machine
economy. It is focusing on the AI Economy on Ethereum that provides AI
agents and robots payment, coordination, and governance capabilities
without intermediaries, and a Decentralized AI Stack ensuring AI's
future doesn't depend solely on centralized entities. The team will
collaborate closely with Protocol and Ecosystem teams to link protocol
improvements with AI builder needs while funding innovative public
goods, continuing work on the ERC-8004 standard for AI agent identity
verification and trustworthiness proofs. The initiative operates under
the principle that Ethereum makes AI more trustworthy while AI makes
Ethereum more useful, as intelligent agents require neutral base
layers for value and reputation while Ethereum benefits by becoming
that infrastructure layer and AI escapes lock-in to centralized
platforms.

 HOW TO SECRETLY ONBOARD 1B TELEGRAM USERS INTO CRYPTO (8 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Hybrid dApps solve the fundamental problem of TON's 1 billion
Telegram users being locked out of EVM's rich application ecosystem by
running Solidity smart contract logic behind native TON user
experiences, allowing users to interact through familiar TON wallets
and Telegram interfaces without knowing complex EVM machinery operates
behind the scenes. The three-layer architecture consists of standard
TON/Telegram frontends, TAC infrastructure with distributed sequencer
networks and automatic asset bridging, and existing Solidity contracts
running on TAC EVM with full access to battle-tested DeFi primitives
and mature tooling. Users connect TonKeeper wallets using standard TON
Connect patterns while the TAC SDK handles all cross-chain complexity,
including token locking, bridging, and address translation, with
native TON and jettons automatically working as ERC-20 tokens on the
EVM side. The system enables developers to deploy once and serve both
EVM and TON users from day one, leveraging proven Solidity contracts
without rewrites while providing unified liquidity flows and network
effects, with transactions feeling completely native to TON users
despite complex cross-chain operations involving consensus, asset
bridging, and smart contract execution happening transparently in the
background. 

 STABLECOIN-ENABLED MARKETS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 With nearly $300 billion stablecoins in circulation and significant
regulatory progress through the GENIUS Act, White House Working Group
on Digital Asset Markets, and the SEC's Project Crypto initiatives,
the focus is shifting from payments to new markets uniquely enabled by
stablecoins' 24/7 movement capabilities. Historically, new markets
have driven stablecoin adoption more than payments, with crypto
exchanges in Asia fueling Tether's rise as traders held USDT as a
store of value, and DeFi's 2020 boom providing USDC with venues
demanding digital dollars. Three promising categories include new
leverage instruments requiring instantaneous funding where stablecoins
enable instant collateral deposits versus multi-day traditional wire
transfers, company-to-company lending where businesses holding cash in
stablecoins can engage in shorter-term capital markets, and onchain
liquidity provision, and global lotteries leveraging crypto's ability
to accept and distribute capital worldwide with programmable proceeds.

 LOW-RISK DEFI COULD BE ETHEREUM'S “GOOGLE SEARCH” MOMENT (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 “Low-risk DeFi” (e.g., payments, savings, synthetic assets, and
fully collateralized lending) may become Ethereum's foundational
revenue driver, similar to how search monetized Google. With Ethereum
DeFi losses now near historical lows and yields on stablecoins
becoming competitive with TradFi, these products are emerging as both
safer and culturally aligned with Ethereum's mission of global
financial inclusion. Unlike speculative frenzies, low-risk DeFi is a
sustainable use case that delivers real-world value while still
generating the economic activity to sustain ETH and the ecosystem.
Ethereum has found its anchor application, one that is both profitable
and principled. 

 ETHEREUM AS A GLOBAL WEALTH ENGINE (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Low-risk DeFi could replicate for the world what structured financial
products did for the US. It can fuel the middle class, expand
education, and drive entrepreneurship. Tools like mortgages and
student loans acted as leverage on human potential, but billions
globally remain excluded from similar access. Ethereum's emerging
ecosystem of savings and lending can democratize these opportunities,
enabling billions everywhere to compound wealth and improve their
lives.
