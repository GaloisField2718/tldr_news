MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BLACKROCK MEETS WITH SEC CRYPTO TASK FORCE TO DISCUSS ETF STAKING (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 BlackRock has met with the SEC's crypto task force to explore
incorporating staking rewards and options strategies into its proposed
spot crypto ETFs. The firm aims to enhance yield generation and
hedging capabilities, signaling a shift beyond passive exposure toward
active performance within ETF structures. 

 COINBASE IS BUYING BITCOIN, JUST DON'T CALL IT A TREASURY STRATEGY (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Coinbase has acquired $150 million in crypto assets, primarily
Bitcoin, increasing its long-term investment portfolio to $1.3 billion
– roughly 25% of its net cash position. CFO Alesia Haas emphasized
that the move is not intended as a MicroStrategy-style treasury
strategy focused on Bitcoin, but rather reflects Coinbase's position
as an operating company investing alongside the broader crypto
ecosystem. CEO Brian Armstrong framed the investment as a testament to
the company's conviction in crypto's transformative potential within
financial services.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE UNVEILS 24/7 BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM FUTURES (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Following the acquisition of Deribit, Coinbase has rolled out 24/7
Bitcoin and Ethereum futures trading on its Advanced platform. The
launch targets global retail and institutional demand for non-stop
access to crypto derivatives, with contracts sized for accessibility
and integrated into Coinbase's regulated framework. 

 REDISTRIBUTION: THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF SLASHING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 EigenLayer is introducing a Redistribution upgrade to its Slashing
mechanism, enabling AVSs to redirect slashed funds to designated
recipients instead of burning them. By repurposing penalties, AVSs can
build advanced use cases like lending and insurance with enhanced
liquidity and risk controls while offering operators and stakers
clearer insight into protocol risk-reward profiles.

 THE 10 TYPES OF CRYPTO VCS YOU'LL MEET, A SATIRICAL SURVIVAL GUIDE (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This satirical thread highlights the most recognizable (and
exasperating) crypto VC archetypes, from ghosting
“founder-friendly” firms to ex-TradFi operators trading on past
credentials. It candidly critiques behaviors, such as demanding board
seats while panic selling or introducing unqualified affiliates into
deals. Beneath the parody lies a serious takeaway: exceptional
investors are rare, and choosing poorly can jeopardize a project's
success. 

 STRIPE, STABLECOINS, AND THE $100B RACE TO REBUNDLE FINANCE (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Stripe's stablecoin pilot, enabled by its $1.1 billion Bridge
acquisition, signals a broader shift in financial services. By
unbundling traditional banking functions, such as value storage and
transfers, and rebundling them around programmable, on-chain money,
Stripe is reshaping infrastructure. Merchant acquirers can now offer
global treasury solutions, real-time cross-border payments, and
embedded yield. Consumer wallets are evolving into full-service
digital banks with payroll, cards, and peer-to-peer capabilities. The
next $100 billion financial leaders will be those who control
distribution channels and integrate stablecoin rails.

 THE CASE FOR ETH FLIPPING BTC (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 While Bitcoin established the store-of-value narrative, it primarily
functions as an institutional asset with limited real-world utility.
Ethereum, by contrast, powers a dynamic ecosystem of decentralized
applications, spanning stablecoins, DeFi, NFTs, and identity
protocols, that actively drive user adoption. As these applications
grow and increasingly lock up ETH, its utility and distribution may
position it to surpass Bitcoin in both use cases and overall value. 

 HAVE WE BEEN BUILDING BLOCKCHAINS WRONG? (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Current blockchains require participants to download and validate
every transaction and state update, forcing dependence on trusted
servers or powerful hardware. By combining shared block propagation
with succinct proofs, lightweight devices like phones can securely
verify large blocks with minimal bandwidth. This approach decouples
block size from verification costs, enabling larger blocks, increased
decentralization, and optional privacy without compromising security.
