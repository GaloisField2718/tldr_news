MARKETS & BUSINESS

 PAXOS UNVEILS USDL, YIELD BEARING STABLECOIN (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Paxos has launched a new yield-generating stablecoin called Lift
Dollar (USDL). The USDL is regulated by the Financial Services
Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) and offers a
programmatic daily yield similar to U.S. Treasury bonds. Issued by
Paxos International in the UAE, the USDL is designed to function like
a savings product. It provides users with a yield of over 5% while
democratizing access to a risk-free rate. The USDL will be initially
distributed in Argentina through partners like Ripio and Buenbit. 

 VANECK RAISES 2030 ETH PRICE TARGET TO $22K (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Influenced by the ETF news, technological improvements, and onchain
data, asset manager VanEck has raised its 2030 ETH price target to
$22k. This is its base case, with a bull case of $154,000 and a bear
case of $2,477. VanEck also reported on how ETH and BTC perform in
traditional and crypto-specific portfolios, finding that a 6%
allocation in a traditional portfolio can improve risk-adjusted
returns.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE LAUNCHES ITS SMART WALLET (1 MINUTE READ) [6]

networks.

 $COIN Q2 ESTIMATES (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The base case priced in by Wall Street this quarter is a 20%
reduction in trading revenue and a 3% reduction in service revenue,
with $1.35B in revenue and 87 cents of earnings per share. The
optimistic case depends on the start of trading for the ETH ETF and
would see $1.52B in revenue with $1.44 EPS. 

 THE ETHEREUM GOVERNMENT - HOW CODE CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE WORLD'S
MOST SPRAWLING BLOCKCHAIN (75 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This report explains the processes and entities behind Ethereum's
decision-making process. Ethereum's decision-making process is
primarily shaped by social norms, not formal rules or voting
mechanisms. Forums serve as a place of discussion and research, with
nine main client team GitHubs hosting the software changes. Though
core developers are the main gatekeepers, the trend has been towards
consistently upgrading and modifying the chain to optimize toward an
ideal endgame.

 THE IDEAL CELEBRITY CRYPTO PROJECT (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vitalik Buterin is unhappy with this cycle's celebrity entrants in
the crypto space, criticizing their purely financial and speculative
intentions. He cites Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis' Stoner Cats NFT
project, which funded a cartoon based on the IP, as the best example
of celebrity experimentation. In his view, a respectable project
should have a public good goal, fun mechanics, and be long-lasting,
with the token price being the last concern for its users. 

 IN SEARCH OF TOKEN-MARKET-FIT (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 If tokens are the product, they flip the traditional model of
creating value without capturing it first. Tokens serve as a
prediction market for investors' interest in a project's direction and
the likelihood it will happen, making them a narrative discovery tool
and creating tight feedback loops for teams. Since tokens immediately
allow teams to receive more capital for a proposed product, they act
as a more efficient and faster version of VC funding. Memes are
necessary to ensure sufficient and consistent interest and liquidity,
keeping the project relevant and with an army of supporters. 

 THE BIG BANG OF STABLECOINS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Stablecoins are in the midst of becoming a massive industry. We may
see thousands and potentially the first $1T stablecoin this decade.
Even though fiat currency worldwide is experiencing inflation, the
current fifth technical revolution means that there will be
significant demand for niche products in the digital age. Stablecoins,
many with different designs and developer composability, enable a
big-bang moment leading to greater capture of the ‚Äúbroad money M2‚Äù
market.
