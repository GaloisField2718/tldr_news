 ETHER JUMPS 10% TO $3.4K AFTER BLOOMBERG UPS ODDS OF SPOT ETF
APPROVAL (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart announced
that they are hearing that the ETH ETFs could be approved on May 23rd,
and upped their odds from 25% to 75%. The approval of an ETH ETF is
being seen as an increasingly political issue, especially after the
move to overturn the SEC's SAB 121 ruling about crypto custody passed
the House and Senate. Upon the news, ETH has increased by over 17%. 

 AN ANALYSIS OF THE SPOT BTC 13F FILINGS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Any entity with over $100 million in assets must file a 13F each
quarter with their holdings. The Q1 filings show that ~3% of the ETF
market cap is held by investment advisors, ~10% by hedge funds, and
~85% by retail investors ‚Äì the average ETF is 35% owned by
investment advisors. The ETFs appeared to hurt Coinbase's retail
volume, as its retail volume is 50% of what it was in 2021. This
author, a macro investment researcher, sees the ETFs as ‚Äúorange FOMO
poker chips‚Äù and says that the goal of a decentralized financial
system should not be pushing money into ETFs.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SP1 GPU ‚Äì A NEXT-GENERATION PROVER FOR SP1 (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Succinct Labs' SP1 prover already achieves state-of-the-art
performance in precompile-heavy proving, with the GPU bringing cost
and latency down 10x. Its benchmarks demonstrate that GPU can
accelerate proving by up to 20x. It is working with hardware teams to
implement the GPU with its prover network and plans to add support in
the coming weeks. 

 LAYERZERO LABS CEO ANNOUNCES PAUSE OF SYBIL 'BOUNTY-HUNTER' PROCESS
AFTER INFLUX OF REPORTS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LayerZero's CEO, Brian Pellegrino, announced that the Sybil hunting
phase of their airdrop program would pause for a couple of days to fix
the design. The protocol's highly-anticipated airdrop tasked users
with Sybil hunting, finding clusters of wallets owned by the same
entity, and reporting them for 10% of their token rewards. Since the
start of the program, LayerZero has received over 3,000 bounty reports
and 30,000 appeals. Going forward, it may introduce a .02 ETH bond and
other design changes to reduce spam reporting.

 THOUGHTS ON KEEPING UP WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CRYPTO (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Incentives drive onchain activity. In 2020, Compound's liquidity
mining program increased protocol TVL from $100M to $600M in a week,
sparking DeFi summer. In 2021, Polygon's joint liquidity mining
programs with DeFi protocols like Aave led to Polygon's TVL increasing
from $100M to billions. In 2024, Layer 2 solutions like Mode seem to
be imitating Blur/Blast's points incentive program. Mode's TVL jumped
$100M in a day during a ‚Äú3X points event‚Äù. Future incentives will
follow a similar pattern, innovating and being widely adopted until
exhausted. 

 NEW LAUNCHES (PART 1) - PRIVATE CAPTURE, PHANTOM PRICING (29 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Private markets and VCs have recently captured most of the upside of
new tokens, primarily led by high FDVs and a poor regulatory
environment. Though ICOs had downsides, they allowed for retail
investors to get in early and for organic price discovery. Memecoins
and investors' rejection of new projects is beginning to cause a
rethinking of the proper launch strategy. If a project is valued at
the top of its sector at launch, it would require a market-wide
expansion to increase in value further.

 CRYPTOPUNKS ANNOUNCES SUPER PUNK WORLD (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Nina Chanel, in collaboration with CryptoPunks for the Punk in

Punk World," featuring hybridized 3D sculptures that challenge and
transcend race and gender norms. It integrates CryptoPunks'
early-internet aesthetics with her distinctive abstract and colorful
art style. This has been a controversial announcement for CryptoPunks
- Crypto Twitter's reaction to this has been fairly negative so far. 

 DEDOLLARIZATION IS REINDUSTRIALIZATION (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Dedollarization could lead to reindustrialization by reducing the
U.S.' reliance on printing dollars and emphasizing domestic
manufacturing. The U.S. must shift from printing money to building
factories to compete globally, particularly with China, which has
developed a robust industrial base (low-skilled to high-skilled labor)
over the past 45 years. This might require an improvement in robotics,
and resistance from regulatory bodies could pose challenges.
