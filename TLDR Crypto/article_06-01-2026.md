 LEDGER CUSTOMERS ALERTED TO NEW DATA EXPOSURE VIA PAYMENT PROCESSOR
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Ledger warned customers that a third-party payments provider,
Global-e, suffered a data exposure that included customer names and
contact details. Ledger has not publicly detailed the breach or its
scope. The incident revives concern about how crypto firms and their
vendors protect user data after Ledger's 2020 leak and ensuing legal
fallout. 

 GLOBAL ETP FLOWS NEAR 2024 RECORD AS BITCOIN LOSES SHARE (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 CoinShares reports $47.2 billion of inflows into crypto ETPs in 2025,
just 3% shy of 2024's record. This was largely driven by a 35%
pullback from Bitcoin funds to $26.9 billion while investors rotated
$12.7 billion into ETH (up 138%), $3.7 billion into XRP, and $3.6
billion into Solana. The US is still dominant with $42.5 billion of
inflows, Europe and Canada are increasing their participation, and
there's a strong start to 2026, showing weekly flows around $582
million.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHEREUM'S BLOCKCHAIN TRILEMMA SOLUTION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ethereum has achieved a breakthrough combination of decentralization,
consensus, and high bandwidth through PeerDAS (live on mainnet) and
ZKEVMs (production-quality performance, pending final safety work).
This solves a fundamental trilemma in decentralized networks,
representing the culmination of 10 years of research. The Ethereum
roadmap calls for gas limit increases and first ZKEVM node deployments
in 2026, with ZKEVMs becoming the primary block validation method by
2027-2030. 

 ETHEREUM'S PURPOSE: RESILIENCE, NOT CONVENIENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ethereum's core mission is to maximize resilience and digital
sovereignty, not to chase marginal efficiency or convenience gains. It
prioritizes these factors to ensure users retain access and control
even if cloud providers, developers, or corporations fail or censor,
making decentralized, permissionless blockspace a safeguard against
catastrophic loss and unequal dependence.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE DOWNFALL OF TGES IN 2025 (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 84.7% of 118 major 2025 TGEs now trade below launch valuations, with
median FDV collapsing 71% and median MC down 67%. High-profile
projects like Berachain, Nillion, and Mira suffered 90%+ drawdowns
within months. The VC-driven “low float, high FDV” model created
pump-and-dump schemes where teams raised at $20M-$50M seed rounds,
listed at $1B+ FDVs, and dumped on retail. The 15.3% survivors shared
three traits: organic demand in sectors like RWA (185% YTD ROI),
payments, and restaking; reasonable entry valuations under $200M FDV;
and institutional alignment as infrastructure layers, stablecoin
issuers, and L2s with consistent transaction fees. 

 OPEN BANKING VS. CARD PAYMENTS: CAN PISPS DISRUPT THE CARD STACK? (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Traditional card payments rely on a complex four-party model that
routes transactions through acquirers, card schemes, and issuers, with
fees distributed across each layer. Open banking proposes a simpler
flow, where Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) can initiate
payments directly from a user's bank account with consent. While this
could bypass card schemes and reshape the payment value chain, card
networks still provide large-scale clearing and settlement, meaning
open banking payments may ultimately replicate similar
batch-settlement dynamics rather than fully replacing cards.

 2026 PREDICTIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DeFi TVL will surpass 2025's $101B peak while Solana validator count
drops to ~500, and Ethereum scales mainnet but won't meaningfully
bring users home from L2s, with at least 3 L2s shutting down due to no
revenue. The stablecoin landscape will shift as USDT/USDC dominance
falls below 70% with boutique offerings gaining share, and Polymarket
will announce its own chain while Hyperliquid reclaims 50% OI
dominance. Market structure will evolve with P/E ratios becoming
accepted valuation metrics, exposing blockchain tokens as overvalued,
as value shifts toward applications. 

 CREATOR COINS AND THE TIMELINE PROBLEM (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Base app creator coins debate mirrors a familiar pattern:
foundations push new user acquisition metas that fracture communities
when OGs feel value isn't flowing to their projects. The core insight
is that creator coins solve the right problem (turning attention into
assets) but in the wrong container – timelines reward loudness and
engagement farming rather than signal. Base could pivot from a
creator-centric to a topic-centric model, essentially building a
“Bloomberg Terminal for culture” that organizes around trends
rather than individual creators.
