MARKETS & BUSINESS

 RATE-CUT OPTIMISM FUELS $921M IN GLOBAL CRYPTO FUND INFLOWS (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Crypto investment products saw $921 million in weekly inflows,
rebounding sharply from the prior week's $513 million outflow. The
increase was driven by rate-cut optimism after lower CPI data and
strong US demand, with Bitcoin funds adding $931 million, their
largest gain since rate cuts began, while Ethereum products saw $169
million in outflows, their first dip in five weeks. Trading volumes
held strong at $39 billion, well above average, and inflows were led
by the US ($843M) and Germany ($502M). 

 CITI, COINBASE PARTNER TO EXPAND DIGITAL ASSET PAYMENTS (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Citi partnered with Coinbase to develop digital asset payment
solutions for institutional clients, initially focusing on
streamlining fiat on/off-ramps and payment orchestration with future
plans for 24/7 fiat-to-stablecoin options. The partnership extends
Citi's push into round-the-clock digital money solutions alongside
existing offerings like Citi Token Services and USD Clearing across
its 94-market network. Citi currently banks 90% of top e-commerce
firms and 15 of the world's 20 largest fintechs. It plans to launch
crypto custody services in 2026 to hold native digital assets like
Bitcoin and Ethereum on behalf of clients.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 JAPAN'S JPYC LAUNCHES FIRST LEGALLY APPROVED YEN STABLECOIN (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 JPYC Inc. has launched Japan's first legally recognized yen-backed
stablecoin, fully compliant under the country's Payment Services Act.
Pegged 1:1 to the yen and backed by bank deposits and government
bonds, the JPYC token is live on Avalanche, Ethereum, and Polygon,
with issuance and redemption handled via the new JPYC EX platform.
Users can acquire tokens after KYC through Japan's My Number ID
system. JPYC targets ¥10 trillion ($65B) in circulation within three
years. Multiple Japanese firms plan to integrate JPYC into retail and
enterprise payment systems, signaling Japan's entry into regulated,
large-scale stablecoin adoption. 

 STABLECOIN LINKED CARDS - WAY BETTER SECURED CREDIT CARDS (11 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Stablecoin-linked cards allow users to spend USDC or USDT at any
Visa/Mastercard merchant through instant fiat conversion at point of
sale. Self-custodial options like Ether.fi allow users to borrow
against crypto collateral at 4% APY while earning 10% yield. Revolut's
zero-fee stablecoin conversion for 65 million customers and Coinbase's
Bitcoin-backed loans powered by onchain protocols like Morpho
demonstrate how vaults are bringing decentralized lending to
mainstream fintech apps, replacing balance sheet lending with private
credit models. The shift toward direct stablecoin acceptance by
merchants and banks will compress settlement times to zero,
eliminating the 1-2% early payment fees merchants currently pay and
the up to 2% consumer on/off ramp costs.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHY X402 MATTERS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 x402 transforms how AI agents pay for data and services by replacing
traditional payment rails, which are slow, risky, and require human
setup, with instant, trustless crypto settlements. Using USDC
microtransactions, agents can autonomously authorize and complete
payments directly with APIs, removing middlemen and chargebacks. This
shift enables fully autonomous AI agents and lets API providers design
new onchain business models where data, compute, and services can
transact seamlessly in real time. 

 A NEW PATH FOR PROPRIETARY AMMS (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Proprietary AMMs managed by professional market makers have captured
40%+ of Solana trading volume by updating pricing curves up to 74
times per second, enabled by extremely cheap updates compared to swaps
that allow market makers to achieve Top of Block priority with minimal
fees and avoid front-running. EVM's expensive storage writes versus
swaps create only a 1:10 ratio instead of Solana's 1:1000, making
updates costly and vulnerable to arbitrageur front-running since
outbidding requires only 10x the priority fee. A proposed solution
combines a Global Storage smart contract for price curve parameters
with a builder policy that reserves the first 5-10% of block gas
exclusively for these updates ordered by priority fee, creating a
protected "fast lane" that guarantees Top of Block execution and
establishes a local fee market competing only against other updates
rather than all DeFi transactions.

 LOCKONOMICS (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Velodrome and Aerodrome – the leading DEXes on Optimism and Base
– pioneered "lockonomics," a model where users lock tokens for up to
4 years to receive voting power, protocol fees, and project bribes,
while LPs receive token emissions instead of direct fees. The system
imposes a "speculation tax" on short-term holders through inflation
that benefits lockers – currently 50% of supply is locked with an
average duration of 3.6 years – and can be stabilized via emission
control to match revenue when growth slows. Velodrome currently runs
15% annualized inflation while delivering 20%+ APY to lockers,
deliberately operating at emissions exceeding revenue to drive sticky
growth through accumulated protocol-owned liquidity and user lock-in
before eventually reverting to a sustainable emissions-equal-revenue
equilibrium. 

 WTF IS ORCHESTRATION (OR CLEARING) (OR SETTLEMENT) (8 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Orchestration (coordinating between parties), clearing (reconciling
who owes what), and settlement (actual fund transfers) evolved in
traditional finance to coordinate transactions across networks of
intermediaries maintaining separate ledgers. Crypto's multi-chain
reality has recreated the same coordination challenges that shaped
traditional finance, despite blockchain's promise of instant
settlement on a single shared ledger. The opportunity lies in
rebuilding these functions through smart contracts, cryptographic
proofs, and programmable liquidity rather than institutional
intermediaries, creating systems that are more performant,
upgradeable, and transparent to handle crypto's expected
orders-of-magnitude higher velocity of money.
