MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO STOCKS PLUNGE WEDNESDAY (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Crypto-related stocks suffered heavy losses on Wednesday, with
bitcoin miners pivoting to AI infrastructure taking the biggest hit,
including Bitfarms, Cipher Mining, Hut 8, and HIVE tumbling 10-15%
while Galaxy Digital fell 15% erasing all gains from its recent
earnings report despite its growing data center operations. The
CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF (WGMI) declined 7% as the multi-month
rally fueled by investor optimism for lucrative data center deals
fizzled out in risk-off markets. Other crypto stocks weren't spared
with Bakkt down 7.5% extending weekly losses to nearly 40% after
surging 300% earlier in October, Strategy slipping 4% below $290, and
Coinbase, Robinhood, Bullish, and Gemini posting 5-6% losses, while
bitcoin held around $108,000 after touching $114,000 Tuesday and the
Nasdaq declined 1% with chipmakers particularly hard hit. 

 CUOMO'S CRYPTO HAIL MARY UNLIKELY TO GIVE AN EDGE OVER MAMDANI (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced plans to create a
"chief innovation officer" and "Innovation Council" for blockchain,
biotech, and AI to attract emerging tech companies, but trails
Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani by double digits just two weeks
before the election. The crypto appeal comes as the Winklevoss twins,
who donated over $30 million to crypto lobbies this year, harshly
criticized Mamdani, while pro-crypto hedge fund managers, including
Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman, have donated millions to Cuomo's
campaign in recent weeks. However, the mayor's office has limited
ability to influence crypto policy as financial frameworks are made at
state and federal levels, with outgoing Mayor Eric Adams' crypto hub
efforts including taking paychecks in Bitcoin and establishing the
Office of Digital Assets, yielding mixed results despite the city
seeing a 177% increase in crypto startups and 143% increase in
blockchain startups since 2019.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AERODROME TO LAUNCH “AERO IGNITION” FOR TOKEN DEBUTS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Aerodrome introduced Aero Ignition, a new framework for launching
tokens on Base that bootstraps liquidity and distributes supply
directly to the community. Projects deposit a share of their tokens as
pre-launch incentives, voters direct emissions to liquidity pools, and
trading begins with emissions flowing immediately, allowing market
activity to set the price. Eligible tokens can list on Coinbase from
day one, making Ignition a streamlined, community-first launch
mechanism designed for clean, liquid token rollouts. 

 INTRODUCING VIRTUALS ROBOTICS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Virtuals is entering robotics by taking the "Middle Way," focusing on
data and capital infrastructure rather than competing in hardware or
model development, addressing two fundamental bottlenecks where
embodied AI cannot learn without rich spatial datasets and robotics
innovation remains slow without scalable financing. The robotics push
completes Virtuals' vision of agentic GDP, where AI automates
reasoning, blockchain enables large-scale coordination, and robotics
provides physical execution to form a self-sustaining circuit where
thoughts, actions, and transactions propagate autonomously across
digital and physical domains. Virtuals' existing infrastructure,
including ACP for agent-to-agent commerce, Butler for human-to-agent
collaboration, and Unicorn for capital formation, now extends into
physicality, positioning the platform as a full-stack engine for all
artificial intelligence, whether embodied or digital, as the
convergence of blockchain trust mechanisms, AI reasoning capabilities,
and robotic execution.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHEN OUR STARTUP PIVOTED ITS WAY TO SURVIVAL (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Accrue began as a dollar-cost averaging app for investing in crypto
and stocks, growing fast until the 2022 bear market froze user
activity and investor interest. A pivot to dollar savings gained
praise but little revenue, revealing that users liked the app but
couldn't afford to use it. The breakthrough came when a Ghanaian user
accidentally used a deposit feature to send money to Nigeria, sparking
a shift toward cross-border payments, a move that grew to 70% of
revenue in seven months. The team's biggest lessons were to let go
quickly, listen beyond direct feedback, follow unexpected data, and
embrace the messiness of finding product-market fit through
persistence and pivots. 

 X402: THE PAYMENT LAYER FOR THE AGENTIC INTERNET (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Coinbase's x402 protocol turns the web's “Payment Required”
status code into a live crypto-powered paywall, letting AI agents and
APIs transact autonomously. Since launching in May with Cloudflare as
a founding partner, x402 has enabled developers to earn directly from
API calls without keys or sign-ups via instant micropayments. Though
still early (90K transactions, $50K in volume), tools like thirdweb's
Nexus now let anyone monetize APIs in under a minute. The vision is,
as AI agents begin powering a new machine-to-machine economy, APIs
with x402 will become the default data endpoints for billions of
autonomous requests, forming the foundation of “Agentic GDP” (the
economic output of intelligent agents transacting on the open web).

 COINBASE'S $375M ECHO BUY IS A SMART BET ON ONCHAIN FUNDRAISING (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Even if Coinbase overpaid for Echo, the move is strategically sound.
By acquiring an onchain fundraising platform, Coinbase gains entry
into a high-margin, high-leverage business that strengthens its entire
ecosystem. As long as startups keep forming and seek the
lowest-friction way to raise capital, this bet pays off, making the
price tag secondary to the long-term strategic position. 

 AI AND UX ARE POWERING THE NEXT WAVE OF CRYPTO WALLETS (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The future of crypto wallets hinges on AI-driven usability, not
complexity. There's a shift from seed phrases to smart, embedded, and
intent-based wallets that abstract key management, simplify
onboarding, and automate multi-chain interactions. Base is developing
a social, AI-enhanced “Base app” to push Web3 into mainstream
fintech territory, while Askgina.ai envisions wallets as proactive AI
agents executing trades and managing portfolios via natural language.
Tomorrow's wallets will look more like super apps—social, automated,
and intuitive—where the smartest, most seamless user experience
wins.
