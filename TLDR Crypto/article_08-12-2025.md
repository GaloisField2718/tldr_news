 CANADA'S CRYPTO TAX CRACKDOWN (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Canada's tax agency (CRA) has pulled in over $100M CAD (~$72M) from
crypto audits in the last three years, but hasn't brought a criminal
case to court since 2020. Although it estimates ~40% of users on
platforms that it sees are non-compliant or high-risk, the CRA admits
it still can't reliably identify most crypto users. As part of only
its second-ever crypto data dragnet, the CRA forced Dapper Labs to
hand over info on 2,500 users, following an earlier order against
Coinsquare. The gap between money collected and cases prosecuted stems
from cross-border complexity, scarce evidence, and slow international
cooperation, even as Canada gears up a new financial-crimes agency and
continues big AML fines via FINTRAC. 

 POLAND LEFT AS MICA OUTLIER IN THE EU (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Poland's parliament failed to override the president's veto of its
MiCA-alignment bill, leaving the country as the only EU member without
a domestic MiCA framework. Germany, Malta, the Netherlands, and
Lithuania are already issuing MiCA licenses. However, Poland's crypto
market is booming anyway. It ranks 8th in Europe by on-chain value,
with >50% YoY volume growth and ~7.9M people using crypto. Meanwhile,
Italy is warning firms they must be fully MiCA-compliant or shut down
by December 30, and Brussels is exploring a future model where a
single EU-level supervisor regulates exchanges across the bloc, which
could eventually reduce the impact of national holdouts like Poland.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 METAMASK INTEGRATES POLYMARKET (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 MetaMask has integrated Polymarket into its mobile app, enabling
one-tap funding with any token on any EVM chain and MetaMask Rewards
points toward a potential MASK airdrop as Consensys reportedly plans
an IPO. The integration provides a new access point for Polymarket,
which recently secured CFTC approval to re-enter the US and is
courting a $15 billion valuation after receiving $2 billion in
strategic funding from NYSE parent ICE at a $9 billion valuation. 

 KRAKEN LAUNCHES HIGH-TOUCH VIP PROGRAM (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Kraken launched an invitation-only VIP program that requires $10
million average balances or $80 million annual trading volume, pairing
ultra-high-net-worth clients with dedicated relationship managers that
provide 24/7 support, subject-matter expert access, and exclusive
Formula 1, football, and cultural experiences ahead of its early 2026
US IPO. The high-touch service competes with Binance's recent
"prestige" offering for clients up to $10 million net worth as
exchanges fill the wealth management gap for family offices and
sophisticated traders.

 BITCOIN FACES JAPAN RATE HIKE: DEBUNKING THE YEN CARRY TRADE (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Fears of a yen carry trade unwind from the Bank of Japan's expected
0.75% rate hike are overblown as the move is already priced into
Japanese government bond yields near multi-decade highs, and
speculators hold net long yen positions, limiting panic buying
potential, contrasting with August 2024's bearish positioning that
triggered market chaos. The yield differential between Japan's 0.75%
and the US' 3.75% remains wide enough to favor American assets and
discourage mass carry trade unwinding, with BOJ staying the most
dovish major central bank. The real risk lies in Japanese tightening
sustaining elevated US Treasury yields that counter Fed rate cuts,
dampening global risk appetite by raising borrowing costs, rather than
a sudden yen surge, while Trump's fiscal expansion push could stoke
debt fears, lifting bond yields further. 

 MARKET ECHOES EARLY 2022 AS ONCHAIN STRESS MOUNTS (5 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Glassnode's weekly report shows Bitcoin market conditions echoing the
early 2022 bear market as spot price fell below the 0.75 quantile,
placing over 25% of supply underwater, while total supply in loss
reached 7.1 million BTC, matching 2022 levels. BlackRock's IBIT posted
its sixth consecutive week of outflows totaling $2.7 billion over five
weeks as spot market activity deteriorates. Open interest declined
through November and December as perpetual funding rates cooled to
neutral with brief negative prints, while options positioning ahead of
next week's FOMC meeting showed a cautious stance with upside being
sold rather than chased. Despite onchain stress, realized cap net
change shows $8.69 billion monthly capital inflows, down from the
summer peak of $64.3 billion, as derivatives data reinforces reduced
willingness to take risk following October's liquidation flash crash.

 NYT'S “BANK DEPOSIT VS STABLECOIN WALLET” GRAPHIC BACKLASH (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A New York Times infographic contrasts bank deposits (insured,
interest-bearing, with legal rights) against stablecoin balances
(uninsured, issuer keeps yield, weaker legal claims). However, this is
a stacked comparison as banks historically share very little of the
yield they earn, many countries have weak or no deposit insurance, and
large depositors are just unsecured creditors of leveraged banks. In
crypto, users can move stablecoins into DeFi or tokenized T-bill
products to capture much higher yields directly, and self-custody
avoids many of the freezes and capital controls that can hit bank
accounts. 

 CRYPTO IS GOING MAINSTREAM (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto is quietly integrating as a secure communication layer between
applications rather than through dominant L1s like Ethereum or Solana.
Stablecoins already process $9 trillion adjusted annual volume,
rivaling Visa and PayPal by representing fiat balances on
interoperable blockchain transport. Apps like PayPal and LINE Pay are
operating as independent L2s posting ordered transactions to L1s using
erasure coding, where each validator handles constant data loads
regardless of scale. Monad excitement reflects outdated mental models,
as fast finality became table stakes and developer lock-in to
monolithic VMs contradicts a decade of experience showing easy EVM
portability, while unified liquidity emerges from universal base
layers enabling secure communication across chains rather than single
blockchains attempting everything.

 ETHEREUM ‘KILLER' VS ETHEREUM L2 REALITY (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 From 2019 to 2024, Solana marketed itself as the scalable, monolithic
alternative to “band-aid” L2s, but by 2024 to 2025, Base was
leading L2s in TVL growth, daily active users, and meme/creator
activity, even overtaking Solana in new token launches and associated
DEX volume in August. 

 ETHEREUM FEES & STABLECOIN LIQUIDITY (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Median transaction fees on Ethereum are at all-time lows, even as
dollar stablecoin supply on Ethereum hits all-time highs. 

 ZKSYNC LITE DEPRECATION IN 2026 (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 ZKsync is planning to shut down ZKsync Lite (its original 2020-era ZK
rollup) sometime in 2026, calling it a completed
“proof-of-concept” that paved the way for newer products like
ZKsync Era, ZK Stack chains, and Prividiums. 

 RAINBOW'S UNIQUE TOKEN MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [15]
