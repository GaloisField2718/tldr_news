MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FINCEN WARNS OF RISING CRYPTO ATM FRAUD (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 FinCEN has issued a notice urging financial institutions to monitor
and report suspicious crypto ATM activity, highlighting increased
usage by criminal organizations (e.g., drug cartels) and targeting of
vulnerable elderly populations. Lawmakers have responded by
introducing legislation to tighten regulation of crypto ATMs, aiming
to prevent fraud and ensure operators enforce customer verification
protocols. 

 ETHEREUM HITS $238B IN MONTHLY VOLUME, HIGHEST SINCE 2021 (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Ethereum recorded $238 billion in onchain volume in July, a 70% MoM
increase and its highest since December 2021. It also hit an all-time
record of 46.67 million monthly transactions and 17.55 million active
addresses, marking a full onchain revival. With ETH closing July at
$3,700, the network's usage and price are both testing multi-year
highs, signaling renewed momentum across Ethereum's ecosystem.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 REI: RETHINKING LLMS FROM THE GROUND UP (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Today's LLMs have hit a reasoning plateau. REI is creating a modular
“Core” framework that mirrors human cognition by separating
language processing, persistent memory, and a dedicated Reasoning
Cluster for logic and planning. By orchestrating specialized expert
models rather than relying on one giant network, Core enables
real-time learning, structured concept formation, and transparent
reasoning paths. This architecture promises true adaptive intelligence
by learning from each interaction rather than just predicting next
words, and greater efficiency compared to brute-force mega-models.
REI's onchain tokenomics also make it a uniquely investable,
crypto-native bet on next-gen AI research. 

 VENTUALS: MAKING PRIVATE MARKETS PUBLIC (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ventuals, built on Hyperliquid, will open a multi-trillion-dollar
private markets asset class by letting anyone trade perpetual futures
on pre-IPO company valuations with up to 10x leverage and low fees.
Each market's price oracle pulls from secondary sale data to reflect
real-world valuation, and traders can go long or short using
Hyperliquid infrastructure. It is powered by HIP-3, Hyperliquid's
protocol for enabling custom perp markets, and represents one of the
first practical use cases of the standard. The Ventuals testnet will
launch soon, making private startup exposure widely accessible beyond
traditional VC circles.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE BANK SECRECY ACT IS BROKEN. TECHNOLOGY CAN FIX IT (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) is outdated as its decades-old data
mandates are inefficient, insecure, and incompatible with modern
technology. Today's compliance stack requires firms to store and
transmit vast amounts of personal data, much of it unread and unused,
creating unnecessary risks for users and institutions alike. This
legacy model should be replaced with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs),
allowing users to prove compliance (e.g. age and sanctions) without
exposing sensitive info. Congress and Treasury should modernize rules
and embrace ZKP-based systems as part of the broader push for crypto
regulatory clarity. 

 FIVE THINGS INVESTORS SHOULD PONDER ON CRYPTO (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Digital assets vary widely, from “digital gold” Bitcoin to
Ethereum's multifaceted infrastructure, speculative memecoins to
asset-backed stablecoins, so investors must assess each on its own
merits. Crypto hasn't replaced traditional payments or become a
reliable store of value, but it has endured criticism, seen its market
cap soar, and achieved stablecoin transaction volumes on par with
Visa. Mainstream finance and shifting geopolitics, including efforts
to onshore innovation and foster dollar-based stablecoins, are
accelerating crypto's integration into global markets. Beyond price
action, blockchain's true impact may lie in forcing a rethink of
entrenched financial and geopolitical frameworks, even as criminality,
consumer risks, and conflicts of interest emphasize the need for
stronger regulation.

 PHANTOM ACQUIRES SOLSNIPER TO EXPAND SOLANA TRADING TOOLS (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Phantom has acquired Solsniper, a high-speed Solana memecoin trading
platform, as part of its strategy to evolve beyond wallet
infrastructure. Solsniper will continue operating independently, with
new features planned. The deal follows Phantom's February acquisition
of token/NFT data platform SimpleHash and comes after its $150M Series
C led by Sequoia and Paradigm. Phantom is positioning itself as a
full-stack Solana ecosystem hub amid volatile but growing memecoin
interest. 

 ETHEREUM TURNS 10: FROM EXPERIMENT TO WALL STREET'S BACKBONE (20
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ethereum has transformed from an experiment launched by developers in
a Berlin loft into a $420 billion platform that serves as the backbone
for Wall Street's next generation of finance. Major institutions like
BlackRock, Robinhood, and Deutsche Bank build directly on its
infrastructure. Stablecoins on Ethereum now process $28 trillion
annually, surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined, while tokenized
assets from money market funds to stocks are increasingly migrating to
Ethereum-based platforms for faster, cheaper transactions with
advanced functionality.
