MARKETS & BUSINESS

 ETHEREUM LABELED 'STANDOUT' AS CRYPTO FUNDS ADD $785 MILLION IN FIFTH
STRAIGHT WEEK OF INFLOWS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Crypto investment products saw $785 million in inflows last week,
marking the fifth consecutive week of gains. Ethereum was labeled the
“standout performer” after adding $205 million (the strongest
showing this year). The uptick reflects renewed investor confidence
following Ethereum's Pectra upgrade and leadership changes, even as
U.S. spot ETH ETFs contributed just $41.8 million. 

 STRATEGY ADDS 7,390 BTC FOR $765M (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) acquired 7,390 BTC for
approximately $765 million at an average price just under $103,500 as
bitcoin climbed past $100 K, lifting its year-to-date bitcoin yield to
16.3% and bringing its total holdings to 576,230 BTC purchased at an
average cost of $69,726. At today's prices, those holdings are worth
over $59.2 billion, representing an unrealized gain of $19.2 billion
(47%). In a concurrent SEC filing, Strategy disclosed a class-action
lawsuit in the Eastern District of Virginia accusing its executives of
misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its
bitcoin-focused strategy.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ENDGAME: MAXING PERFORMANCE WITH LOW NODE SPECS (18 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 MegaETH tackles the scalability bottleneck of redundant work by
dividing network roles into four specialized node types: Sequencers
that hold state in RAM and produce 10 ms blocks, lightweight Provers
that generate cryptographic proofs asynchronously,
resource‑efficient Replicas that apply state diffs and verify them
via proofs, and optional Full Nodes that re‑execute blocks for
maximum trustlessness. This architecture eliminates the need for every
node to perform every task, achieving 1.7 Gigagas/s throughput today
without pricing out smaller participants thanks to minimal hardware
requirements for Prover and Replica nodes. Sequencer rotation among a
set of builders preserves decentralization, while Full Nodes offer a
trust anchor for critical applications. MegaETH's long-term goal is
1ms block times and over 10 Gigagas/s capacity. 

 INTRODUCING COINBASE DEVELOPER PLATFORM WALLET POLICIES (12 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 CDP's new policy engine allows wallets to filter transactions to a
restricted set of addresses, limit access to known smart contracts,
and enforce per-address transaction limits. Combining the policies
with AgentKit enables a spectrum of guardrail strength for ensuring
agents have autonomy to the degree a human is comfortable with. CDP's
wallet product is now a leading solution for building programmable,
server-side wallets with applications including neobanks, AI agents,
and embedded experiences.

 A LOCAL-NODE-FAVORING DELTA TO THE SCALING ROADMAP (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Vitalik Buterin has outlined a refinement to Ethereum's scaling
roadmap that preserves the ability to run personal full nodes despite
rising L1 gas limits. “Partially stateless nodes” verify blocks
without storing the full state, keeping only user-specified data. This
enables private, censorship-resistant, and trustless local access to
the chain. Short-term priorities include fully rolling out EIP-4444,
building erasure-coded distributed history, and repricing
storage-heavy opcodes to lower the barrier for node operation in a
more data-intensive future. 

 THE CRYPTO OPSEC BIBLE (30 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Web2 attack vectors like social engineering, key leakage,
supply‑chain exploits account for over three times the value lost to
smart‑contract bugs ($3.31 billion vs. $983 million since
January 2023), driven by poor DevOps, phishing, and lax device/key
management. A paranoid “Don't Trust, Verify” mindset, strict
phishing education, hardware‑key 2FA, sandboxed code execution, and
rigorous password/key rotation are critical for thwarting threats
ranging from script kiddies to nation‑state actors. This guide
includes platform‑specific best practices for Twitter, Telegram,
Discord, Slack, Google Workspace, GitHub, cloud environments, and
multisigs, plus physical security measures against tailgating and
device compromise.

 SEEKING CLEAR, COMMON SENSE STABLECOIN REGS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Bipartisan sponsors designed the GENIUS Act to establish a pro-growth
federal stablecoin framework. It requires fully backed, privately
issued “digital dollars” to maintain U.S. Dollar primacy, cut
payment costs for families and small businesses, and direct fintech
investment to American communities. Progressive advocacy groups like
Americans for Financial Reform and Better Markets instead pressured
the SEC under Chair Gensler toward enforcement-first crypto
regulation, leading to high-profile policy missteps and disenchantment
among crypto-savvy voters. Their behind-the-scenes influence derailed
early congressional hearings and favored enforcement over transparent
rulemaking, alienating a key constituency in the 2024 election. 

 AN ARGUMENT FOR DROPPING PERMIT2 (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 With EIP-7702 now live, developers would like permit2
(Uniswap-created workaround for gasless token approvals) to be retired
because of its added security risks and implementation complexity.
Unlike permit2, which required broad approvals and was prone to
multi-asset abuse via a single signature, EIP-7702 enables clean batch
transactions without added smart contract code. Though adoption will
take time, 7702 offers a more secure and streamlined path forward,
making permit2 redundant.

 WALLET-LINKED CRYPTO CARDS ARE COMING (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Over the next 12–24 months, major crypto wallets like Phantom and
Trust Wallet are expected to roll out integrated crypto cards,

 METAPLANET BUYS 1,004 BITCOIN FOR $104 MILLION, PUSHING HOLDINGS TO
7,800 BTC (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Japanese investment firm Metaplanet purchased 1,004 BTC for ~$104M,
bringing its total holdings to 7,800 BTC (~$806M). 

 BITCOIN MONETARY PREMIUM (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Claiming that altcoins deserve a “monetary premium” just because
Bitcoin has one is flawed logic.

 Many assets today move on narrative, not fundamentals, and some
always will.
