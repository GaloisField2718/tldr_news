 BITCOIN AND XRP PRICES PLUNGE IN SOUTH KOREA AS PRESIDENT DECLARES
MARTIAL LAW (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin and XRP prices plunged on South Korean exchanges after
President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law amidst political
tensions, triggering extreme volatility and a temporary inverse
"Kimchi Premium" (refers to higher prices for Bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies on Korean exchanges). Upbit, the country's largest
crypto exchange, saw Bitcoin and XRP prices drop by 33% and 52%
respectively before partial recoveries. 

 SILK ROAD BITCOIN WORTH NEARLY $2B MOVED TO COINBASE PRIME (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The US government transferred 19,800 BTC, worth almost $2 billion, to
Coinbase Prime, likely with the intent to sell following recent court
approval for liquidation. The assets come from the Silk Road seizure.
The move caused Bitcoin to dip below $96,000, though the market
reaction was notably muted compared to previous government sales. The
move, executed through the US Marshals Service's partnership with
Coinbase Prime, represents a significant portion of confiscated
assets. The government still holds approximately $18 billion in seized
crypto assets.
