MARKETS & BUSINESS

 NASDAQ TIGHTENS SCRUTINY OF CRYPTO TREASURY RAISES (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Nasdaq is increasing oversight of U.S.-listed firms raising capital
to buy crypto, now requiring shareholder votes and greater
disclosures, with potential suspension or delisting for noncompliance.
The move follows an increase in digital asset treasury (DAT) raises,
with 154 firms announcing $98.4B in planned crypto purchases this
year. The crackdown adds new hurdles for companies mirroring Strategy
and BitMine's balance sheet playbooks, potentially slowing deal
timelines. 

 'NFTS TURNED OUT TO BE A FAD,' SAYS KEVIN O'LEARY (7 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Shark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary co-purchased a $13 million Kobe
Bryant-Michael Jordan collectible card while dismissing NFTs as a
"fad," emphasizing his preference for physical assets that can be
touched and verified over purely digital tokens. Despite rejecting
NFTs due to their lack of tangible existence, O'Leary believes his
physical collectibles will eventually be tokenized for easier
management and liquidity, as part of his broader "Wall Street onchain"
vision to modernize asset management through blockchain
infrastructure. His stance reflects the broader NFT market decline,
which peaked at $25 billion in trading volume in 2021 but fell over
80% by mid-2022 as hype faded and prices for major collections like
Bored Ape Yacht Club plummeted.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 TEMPO: A PAYMENTS CHAIN FROM STRIPE AND PARADIGM (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stripe and Paradigm have announced Tempo, a new payments-first
blockchain specifically designed for stablecoins and real-world
payments infrastructure that features major enterprise design
partners, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Shopify, Visa, and Deutsche
Bank. The blockchain offers 100,000+ TPS throughput with sub-second
finality, EVM compatibility, and native support for payments and gas
fees in any stablecoin through an enshrined AMM, along with
payments-optimized UX features like dedicated payment lanes and memos.
Tempo aims to bring traditional payment use cases onchain, including
global payouts, payroll, remittances, and microtransactions, while
maintaining principles of decentralization and stablecoin neutrality
through an independent validator network. 

 FIREBLOCKS LAUNCHES STABLECOIN PAYMENTS NETWORK (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Fireblocks has launched an enterprise-grade stablecoin network to
help financial firms move USD-pegged tokens and build payment
products, with Circle, Bridge, Zerohash, and Yellow Card among 40
participants. The network introduces unified APIs and workflows to
streamline stablecoin transactions across providers, blockchains, and
fiat rails, positioning Fireblocks as core infrastructure for global
payments. With stablecoin markets projected to reach trillions, the
firm is targeting significant institutional demand while expanding
services in emerging markets like those in Africa.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHY HYPE DATS CAN WIN (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Digital Asset Treasury companies holding Hyperliquid's HYPE token
possess a unique competitive advantage in the treasury company space
through their ability to generate substantial yield via HIP-3,
Hyperliquid's exchange infrastructure sharing mechanism. While BTC
DATs like MicroStrategy rely primarily on brand and capital raising
ability, and ETH/SOL DATs struggle with low staking yields of only
2-5%, HYPE DATs can potentially earn ~24% APY by staking tokens with
exchanges built on Hyperliquid infrastructure and sharing in their
trading fees. However, the strategy requires careful selection of
exchanges to back since each will likely only accept around 1 million
HYPE tokens, forcing HYPE DATs to make strategic bets on which
exchanges will succeed in capturing significant trading volume. 

 SEPTEMBER YIELD FARMING PLAYBOOK (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There are five high-yield DeFi strategies ranging from 12% to 42.5%
APR, including single-sided Bitcoin exposure through GammaSwap Labs at
15% APY with minimal drawdown, and a complex HYPE token strategy using
HyperEVM and Pendle that delivers 42.5% APR through leveraged looping.
The strategies span various protocols and assets, from delta-neutral
stablecoin vaults earning 12% APR to sophisticated USDe staking and
looping strategies on Ethena Labs and Dolomite that can generate over
40% APR plus additional token rewards. Most strategies involve
leverage, looping, or complex multi-protocol interactions to amplify
returns, with associated risks including liquidation exposure and
interest rate volatility that require active monitoring.

 TRADING THE METAGAME: IN PURSUIT OF NARRATIVES (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The cryptocurrency market has fundamentally shifted from valuing pure
technology to prioritizing narrative and actual user adoption, with
many venture-backed infrastructure projects failing because they lack
compelling stories or real usage. Pump Fun's success revealed that
most token buyers simply want price appreciation rather than
technological innovation, exposing how previous cycles were sustained
by speculation on unused blockchains rather than genuine utility.
Market capitalizations are built on public trust and consumer
psychology, requiring projects to either develop better tokenomics
that resemble equity or eliminate tokens altogether. As crypto markets
become more accessible to mainstream users, successful projects must
understand that "normies" interpret value through viral narratives and
social proof rather than technical specifications, making storytelling
as crucial as the underlying technology. 

 MONETIZING ULTRA-NICHE KNOWLEDGE (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Prediction markets represent the first system capable of making
ultra-niche knowledge "liquid," allowing individuals with highly
specific expertise to directly monetize information that previously
had no clear economic value. Unlike traditional knowledge monetization
methods that require building newsletters or convincing investors,
prediction markets enable immediate trading on obscure insights,
fundamentally changing the incentive structure around curiosity and
specialized knowledge. This creates a dual benefit: it rewards
individuals for pursuing seemingly useless interests while
simultaneously making markets more efficient by incorporating diverse,
granular information that was previously trapped in people's heads.
The system transforms the "long tail" of human knowledge into valuable
market signals, potentially creating the most efficient knowledge
aggregation mechanism humans have developed.
