 FRANKLIN TEMPLETON JOINS ETHEREUM ETF RACE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Franklin Templeton has thrown its hat into the ring with an

the firm's launch of a bitcoin ETF, which has seen less demand than
its rivals so far. The SEC has continued to delay decisions on
Ethereum ETFs, fueling speculation about what this could mean for
Ethereum. Most people expect a final decision on the applications by
May.

 DN404: DIVISIBLE NFT STANDARD (3 MINUTE READ) [7]

predecessor ERC404, DN404 operates with two contracts allowing for
actions as both fungible and non-fungible tokens without breaching any
standards. A concept for this standard is available in an open source
repo but it has not been audited yet.

 SPECULATION ON NARRATIVES COMES IN WAVES (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post discusses the speculative waves that are associated with
