MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO TREASURY FEVER SPREADS TO ETHENA AS $360M SPAC DEAL TARGETS
ENA ACCUMULATION (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 StablecoinX is set to merge with Nasdaq-listed shell TLGY Acquisition
Corp under the ticker USDE, raising $360 million from the likes of
Pantera, Dragonfly, Galaxy, and Polychain, including $100 million in
discounted locked ENA and $260 million in cash. The plan is to amass
Ethena's governance token and kickstart a $260 million ENA buyback by
the Ethena Foundation. This SPAC-driven treasury play extends Wall
Street's crypto balance-sheet strategies into DeFi altcoins, fueling a
~5% intraday ENA lift and a 65% weekly surge. 

 POLYMARKET TO RETURN TO U.S. AFTER ACQUISITION (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Polymarket is acquiring CFTC-licensed derivatives exchange QCX for
$112 million, securing the regulatory approval needed to legally
reopen its crypto prediction markets to US users. QCX's registration
will enable Polymarket to offer fully compliant market contracts,
expanding its popular events trading platform that boomed during the
2024 election. The deal comes after both the DOJ and CFTC closed
investigations into Polymarket's prior US operations under a 2022
settlement. With this move, Polymarket aims to re-enter the US “in
the near future,” challenging CFTC-regulated rivals like Kalshi and
potentially shaking up sports betting.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BAM: THE FUTURE OF BLOCK BUILDING ON SOLANA (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 BAM is a high-performance block-building architecture for Solana that
layers a network of TEE-backed scheduler nodes, updated validators,
and a plugin marketplace to enable private, verifiable, and
programmable transaction sequencing. Transactions remain encrypted
until execution inside secure enclaves, with cryptographic
attestations published for public audit, while Plugins let developers
implement custom ordering logic for use cases like CLOBs, perpetuals,
and dark pools. This design curbs harmful MEV, unlocks
application-controlled execution, and creates new revenue streams
through Plugin fees, all without changing Solana's core protocol. A
phased rollout by Jito Labs, followed by broad operator expansion and
eventual open-source governance, will decentralize and scale BAM into
Solana's institutional-grade block-building standard. 

 COINBASE BRINGS PERPETUAL FUTURES TO THE U.S. (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Coinbase has launched CFTC-regulated perpetual futures for U.S.
traders, offering nano BTC and ETH contracts with up to 10x leverage
and no monthly expirations. The product, available via Coinbase
Financial Markets, marks the first time U.S. retail users can access
perpetual-style crypto derivatives on a compliant platform. Contracts
are long-dated (5 years), with low fees starting at 0.02%, enabling
U.S. traders to tap into the most dominant trading tool in global
crypto markets.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE STABLECOIN PLAYS THAT WILL RETIRE YOUR BLOODLINE (35 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Policy, capital, sentiment, and participation are perfectly aligned
for a stablecoin breakout. Ethereum is emerging as the backbone
settlement layer, igniting pent-up demand for projects at this
intersection. Contrarian opportunities include f(x) Protocol's
fxUSD-driven leverage model, Frax's GENIUS-compliant frxUSD ecosystem
and Fraxtal chain, and Curve/Convex's battle-tested liquidity
infrastructure with its new crvUSD stablecoin. Each of these
undervalued tokens is poised to capitalize on regulatory clarity and a
liquidity-rich macro backdrop. 

 3 YEARS OF WEB3 MARKETING KNOWLEDGE IN ONE ARTICLE (14 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Web3 marketing fundamentally differs from traditional marketing by
operating as "narrative warfare," where controlling the story matters
more than conventional funnels, with winners capturing the majority of
liquidity through compelling personal narratives rather than polished
campaigns. Founders must become the face and voice of their projects
through consistent content creation, building trust and authority
directly rather than relying on third parties. Success requires
playing the long game by resisting premature launches or panic pivots
during bear markets while carefully protecting reputation by avoiding
short-term monetization tactics like unsolicited token shilling that
erode credibility. In 2025's Web3 landscape, founders who overcome
their discomfort with video content and personal branding will
dominate, while those who remain invisible behind their projects will
lose market share to less talented but more courageous competitors.

current fee capture, Unit earns ~$12.8M in annualized revenue, with
