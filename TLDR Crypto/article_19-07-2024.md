 WAZIRX SUFFERS $230M HACK (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A detailed investigation into the $230M+ WazirX hack, beginning from
the original exploiter address, revealed preliminary transactions made
on July 10th using Tornado Cash. The tactic involved hints at the
potential involvement of the Lazarus Group. 

 ‚ÄòHE'S CHANGED HIS TUNE'‚ÄîTRUMP REVEALS JPMORGAN CEO'S ‚ÄòSUDDEN'
BITCOIN AND CRYPTO FLIP (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In an interview with Bloomberg, Donald Trump said Jamie Dimon, JP
Morgan's CEO, has ‚Äòchanged his tune a little bit' on Bitcoin.
Previously, Dimon has criticized Bitcoin as a fraud and Ponzi scheme,
but he has been overseeing the development of JP Morgan's proprietary
blockchain and cryptocurrency to improve internal transactions. Trump
also hinted that Dimon is being considered for U.S. Treasury Secretary
under his administration.

 POLYGON ANNOUNCES MATIC TO POL MIGRATION DATE (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 On September 4th, the MATIC to POL migration will occur within the
Polygon network, making POL the primary gas and staking token, marking
its first phase as a key element in future Polygon projects like
AggLayer. For current MATIC holders on the Polygon PoS, no action will
be required for this transition, while those on Ethereum or other
platforms may need to engage with a migration process detailed by the
community. 

 THE SINK L2: SOLVING LONG-TERM VALUE ALIGNMENT (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most general-purpose L2s are like retail brokerages, with little
differentiation and non-unique applications. Introducing native yield
allows L2s to monetize based on assets under management instead of
sequencer fees. The Sink has two primitives ‚Äì a V2 DEX with bribe
mechanisms and a CDP with a stake-able stablecoin ‚Äì to offer high,
scalable yields. The idea is similar to Berachain and Blast combined.

 RECAP OF CRYPTO AND POLICY IN DC (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 With the elections becoming more prevalent, crypto's political
influence continues to shape policy and rhetoric, evidenced by the
Trump-Vance ticket being the first to have a Bitcoin holder on the
ballot. Though the GOP has been leading the charge on pro-crypto
policy, Democrats are catching up and creating bipartisan momentum.
The past few weeks have seen various political wins and losses, like
the house voting not to override Biden's SAB 121 veto, a few CFTC and
SEC hearings, and the SEC's dropped case against Paxos stablecoins. 

 DIVING INTO DARK POOLS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Public institutional moves have far-ranging consequences. Dark pools,
a concept well-known in traditional finance, allow traders to be
confidential when executing transactions. DeFi dark pools currently
suffer from a lack of liquidity and must use novel methods like ZK
proofs to comply with KYC/AML regulations, but they offer better
security, privacy, and cost-efficiency than OTC trading.

 MARK CUBAN'S THOUGHTS ON TRUMP, BITCOIN, AND SILICON VALLEY (1 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Billionaire investor Mark Cuban believes Silicon Valley's support for
Trump is a ‚Äúbitcoin play.‚Äù Trump's support of crypto is excellent,
but it does not significantly impact the price. However, it makes it
easier to operate a business. Bitcoin's price could go extremely high
because of lower tax rates, tariffs, and geopolitical uncertainty.
Ultimately, it could become a global currency and safe haven asset. 

 ‚ÄúPERMISSIONS‚Äù LAYER OF CHAIN ABSTRACTION FRAMEWORK EXPLAINED (5
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The CAKE (Chain Abstraction Key Elements) framework creates four
layers of responsibility ‚Äì applications, permissions, solvers, and
settlement ‚Äì that are independent of one another but critical for a
clean crypto UX. The ‚Äúpermissions‚Äù layer deals with user
transaction authorization and private key storage. Though current
methods like MetaMask require both a ‚Äúsign‚Äù and ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù step,
account abstracted (AA) wallets only require ‚Äúsign.‚Äù Going one
step further, policy-based agents require one ‚Äúapprove‚Äù step and
then deal with everything else, like managing multiple networks and
sub-transactions. This is the design employed by Telegram bots and
Flashbots' SUAVE.
