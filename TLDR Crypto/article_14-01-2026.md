 HOW DOES A NETWORK ENABLE DAPPS WITH LOWER GAS FEES? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Tokenomics on previous generation blockchains make costs
unpredictable, create volatile markets for digital assets, and limit
liquidity.

The Midnight network [4] is a 4th-generation blockchain that separates
the governance and capital from operational costs using a
dual-component model. Here's how it works:

→ NIGHT [4] is the public and transparent token used for governance
and incentives.

→ NIGHT then generates DUST, a shielded resource which powers the
transactions on the network.

→ DApp operators get predictable operational costs and can offset
fees for their users by holding enough NIGHT,

NIGHT IS NOW LISTED ON MAJOR EXCHANGES. LEARN MORE [4]

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SENATE UNVEILS UPDATED MARKET STRUCTURE BILL (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A bipartisan market structure manager's amendment from Senate Banking
Chair Tim Scott would ban paying interest or yield for holding payment
stablecoins while allowing activity-based incentives tied to
transacting, staking, liquidity provision, or posting collateral. The
bill includes a Lummis-Wyden developer liability shield, drew threats
from firms like Coinbase over tougher restrictions, omits a proposed
ethics clause related to the Trump family's crypto ventures, and is
heading to a committee markup as senators work to reconcile competing
committee bills. 

 21SHARES LISTS BITCOIN-GOLD ETP ON LSE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 21Shares' BOLD is a physically backed Bitcoin-plus-gold ETP on the
London Stock Exchange that rebalances monthly by inverse historical
volatility and charges a 0.65% annual fee. The ETP will give UK retail
investors regulated exposure to bitcoin's growth and gold's stability
now that the FCA has lifted its four-year retail ban and opened the
market to wider crypto ETP access.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BNY MELLON'S TOKENIZED CASH: CUSTODIAL PATH TO TOKENIZED COLLATERAL
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 BNY Mellon is launching tokenized cash focused on collateral, margin,
and intraday liquidity (not retail), enabling tokenized cash as
collateral, real-time intraday settlement and reconciliation, and 24/7
availability with bank-deposit legal protections. This is a
custodian-led route (joined by JPM and others and DTCC+Canton
integrations) that could see capital markets in the US first adopt a
tokenized collateral stack on semi-public networks like Canton before
broader public-chain scaling. 

 ZKSYNC 2026 ROADMAP: NO SHORTCUTS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ZKsync's 2026 roadmap prioritizes institutional adoption through
three core products: Prividium (privacy platform for regulated
entities), ZK Stack (evolving into a unified appchain toolkit with
cross-chain liquidity), and Airbender (universal zkVM proving
standard). It is targeting the deployment of production systems with
multiple regulated financial institutions serving “tens of millions
rather than thousands” of users. Milestones include ZKsync Lite
deprecation throughout 2026 and ZK token utility expansion in Q2 2026,
transitioning from governance-only to economic utility via staking and
burns.

 3 WAYS CRYPTO GOES BEYOND CRYPTO IN 2026 (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 a16z crypto outlines three ways cryptographic primitives will expand
beyond traditional blockchain applications in 2026. Zero-knowledge
proof technology is reaching a critical performance threshold, with
zkVM provers dropping from 1,000,000X to approximately 10,000X
overhead, enabling single GPUs to generate proofs of CPU execution in
real-time by year-end and potentially unlocking verifiable cloud
computing at scale. Prediction markets are expected to evolve through
integration with LLM-based oracles for truth determination and AI
agent traders that surface novel market signals. Crypto-native
mechanisms like tokenized commitments and onchain verification
histories are positioned to create new credibility. 

 VITALIK BUTERIN WARNS DECENTRALIZED STABLECOINS STILL HAVE DEEP FLAWS
(3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has publicly identified three
fundamental technical challenges that remain unsolved in decentralized
stablecoin design: price benchmarking mechanisms, oracle security
vulnerabilities, and inadequate staking incentive models. Buterin
characterized these as the “hardest problems” facing decentralized
stablecoin infrastructure, suggesting they represent significant
barriers to achieving the reliability required for mainstream
adoption.

 DISPELLING STABLECOIN BANKING MYTHS AS CONGRESS DEBATES REWARDS (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Fears around stablecoins harming banks and credit are overstated.
Stablecoin growth can increase bank deposits, lower borrowing costs,
and benefit savers without meaningfully constraining lending.
Competition from reward-bearing stablecoins would primarily pressure
bank profitability rather than credit availability. Non-bank lenders
already dominate US credit, meaning that restricting stablecoin
rewards would unfairly favor bank shareholders over consumers as
lawmakers revisit market structure legislation. 

 YC-BACKED KONTIGO VIOLATES VENEZUELA SANCTIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Y Combinator-backed fintech Kontigo allegedly violated US Venezuela
sanctions by facilitating USDC-to-bolivar conversions through
sanctioned banks, including Banco de Venezuela, exploiting JPMorgan
Chase and Stripe/Bridge infrastructure to provide US banking rails for
Venezuelan users. Following the allegations, JPMorgan froze Kontigo's
accounts, Bridge began offboarding the company, and Binance blocked
Kontigo-linked wallet transactions. There are significant compliance
risks for stablecoin infrastructure providers. This case demonstrates
how sanctioned jurisdictions can exploit legitimate US payment rails
through intermediary fintech companies.
