 DEXS STRUGGLE TO COMPETE WITH CEXS AS FUTURES TRADING VOLUMES SHIFT
BACK (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are losing market share to centralized
exchanges (CEXs) in the futures market. DEX market share has dropped
from 5.18% to 3.26% of trading volume since February. This is because
of challenges like having lower liquidity and less user-friendly
interfaces causing traders to shift back to centralized platforms. 

 CFTC SAYS COURT GOT IT WRONG IN ALLOWING KALSHI TO OFFER ELECTION
BETS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The CFTC is appealing a court ruling that allowed prediction market
Kalshi to offer election betting contracts, arguing that the district
court misinterpreted legal terms and that these contracts may harm
election integrity. Despite the CFTC's objections and ongoing efforts
to ban political event betting, Kalshi has launched bets on who will
win the U.S. presidential election.

 INTRODUCING DGEN1: THE ETHOS PHONE (5 MINUTE READ) [8]

 INTRODUCING SUPERLANE: SUPERCHAIN INTEROPERABILITY TODAY (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Superlane, a collaboration between the Velodrome DEX and Hyperlane
interoperability protocol, brings interchain apps, shared liquidity,
and interchain governance to OP Stack L2s. It introduces features
proposed in Optimism's recent Superchain Interoperability initiative
several months before its release, with a path to upgrade once the
official approach arrives. Since Hyperlane allows for permissionless
integrations, any OP Stack L2 can join the Superlane. Velodrome will
start by making XVELO a Superchain ERC20.

 POSSIBLE FUTURES FOR THE ETHEREUM PROTOCOL, PART 2: THE SURGE (25
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In his second post outlining Ethereum's roadmap, Vitalik Buterin
focuses on how Ethereum will scale to 100,000 TPS following a
rollup-centric approach. The project's primary goals are to maintain
the L1's decentralization and robustness, have some L2s fully inherit
Ethereum's properties, and provide maximum interoperability between
rollups for a seamless experience. Buterin dives into several
approaches: data compression, better L2 proof systems, L2
interoperability improvements, and L1 scaling.

 ANDRE CRONJE CRITIQUES APPCHAINS (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DeFi Pioneer and Sonic Labs (formerly Fantom) founder Andre Cronje
believes that independent appchains suffer from high infrastructure
costs, fragmented liquidity, and a lack of developer support.
Opponents of this view say rollup-as-a-service providers make support
easier and solutions like AggLayer promote liquidity interoperability.
Builders that agree with Cronje cite the lack of network effects on
appchains and competition between builders.
