MARKETS & BUSINESS

 STABLECOIN INFLOWS RISE BEFORE FED RATE DECISION (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin held around $113,000 as traders rotated into stablecoins
ahead of the Federal Reserve's expected 25 basis point rate cut, with
stablecoin supply rising for the first time since September, while
exchange order book depth collapsed to 40% of pre-liquidation levels.
BTC futures open interest remained at $26.8 billion with highly
divergent funding rates amid $514 million in 24-hour liquidations
split 69-31 between longs and shorts. Spot BTC ETFs recorded $202.4
million in daily inflows while ETH ETFs saw $246 million, as
Grayscale's Solana Trust converted to a spot ETF (GSOL) on NYSE Arca
and World Liberty Financial prepared to airdrop 8.4 million WLFI
tokens to early USD1 users following a points program that drove USD1
to become the sixth-largest stablecoin. 

 CONSENSYS PREPARING IPO WITH JPMORGAN AND GOLDMAN SACHS (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Consensys has reportedly hired JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to lead its
initial public offering. The move follows other successful crypto IPOs
this year, including Circle and Bullish, as firms capitalize on a
renewed wave of institutional and regulatory openness under the
current administration's pro-crypto stance. Consensys also operates
Infura, Linea, and backs ETH treasury firm SharpLink, positioning
itself as a core pillar of Ethereum's infrastructure ahead of the IPO.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 WESTERN UNION TO LAUNCH USD-BACKED STABLECOIN ON SOLANA IN 2026 (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Western Union announced plans to launch the US Dollar Payment Token
(USDPT), a Solana-based stablecoin issued by Anchorage Digital Bank,
in the first half of 2026. The token will allow Western Union's 100
million customers to send money internationally without relying on
local currencies, expanding its 175-year legacy of global payments
into the digital asset era. 

 BRALE LAUNCHES API BRIDGING BANK RAILS AND STABLECOINS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Brale has launched a powerful new API that bridges traditional
banking rails with onchain payments, enabling users to ACH debit via
Plaid and mint stablecoins instantly. The API supports custodial and
non-custodial wallets, ~20 blockchains, and ~50 stablecoins, all at
bank-level pricing (as low as $0.01 per transaction). It also includes
RTP support, customizable transfer branding, and the ability to fund
any off-chain payment with stablecoins, creating a low-cost link
between legacy finance and crypto-native systems.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 VERIFYING USERS AGAIN AND AGAIN COSTS YOU MONEY AND ANNOYS YOUR
CUSTOMERS. HERE'S A BETTER WAY (SPONSOR) [8] 

 Verify to trade, verify again to stake — crypto companies keep
paying to verify the same users, adding friction that tanks conversion
rates. Persona Connect [8] lets you share verified KYC and KYB data
with partners you trust. Users verify once, data travels safely, and
you can stay compliant and onboard faster. See how reusable KYC works

 LOOPING TO ZERO: WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Crypto is repeating the 1980s-90s hedge fund era when blowups like
LTCM led to the creation of funds of funds as a middle layer for
allocation and risk management. Vaults now require the same onchain
infrastructure that traditional finance developed after massive
failures. Onchain funds of funds would handle full risk management
systems tracking positions across vaults, quantitative risk checks,
manager due diligence, protocol-level fundamental research, and
dynamic rebalancing to maintain concentration limits and risk-adjusted
returns. Crypto users lack the expertise to properly size vault
positions or track underlying risks, creating demand for professional
fund-of-funds services that will reach billions in AUM as the winners
filter for best strategies and publish public research to justify
allocations. 

 WHAT IS N1? (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 N1 is a permissioned high-performance L1 launching with sub-1ms
latency, 100,000+ TPS per application through dedicated compute
environments, and gasless transactions where protocols pay less than a
cent in fees instead of users. The chain supports Solidity, Rust, and
TypeScript development with in-house collaboration on flagship apps to
avoid ecosystem fragmentation, using Jito (Re)staking for validation
and NordVM for asynchronous virtual machine execution.

 THE ULTIMATE SUPERCYCLE (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The 2020s mark the start of an 80-year civilizational reinvention
cycle with AI, clean energy, and bioengineering converging for the
first time as solar and wind costs drop 20% per doubling of output
while CRISPR makes biology programmable. Crypto serves as the
coordination layer through blockchains and zero-knowledge proofs,
enabling a shift from financial capitalism optimized for extraction to
sustainable capitalism based on transparent protocols and
abundance-driven cooperation. This author's investment thesis
expresses this supercycle view by going long crypto (trust layer), AI
(intelligence layer), and abundance plays in energy storage and
bioengineering. They predict a 25-year boom despite current political
division and institutional turbulence that mirrors crisis periods
preceding past reinventions. 

 A YEAR ONE PROJECTION OF HIP-3 REVENUE (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Hyperliquid launched HIP-3 permissionless perp market deployment
requiring 500,000 HYPE stake (~$20 million) and charging double the
standard fee rate, with projections of $60 million in trading fees,
$16 million in auction revenue, and 5 million HYPE staked across 10
markets in year one at 5% of total Hyperliquid volume. The upgrade
responds to $3.3 billion bridging to competing alt-perp DEXs like
Lighter, Aster, and EdgeX, with nearly 20 teams announcing HIP-3
markets. Equity perps remain unproven with weak demand – Ostium
generates only $1.8 million daily stock perps volume versus $44.3
million in crypto – though the model mirrors Ethereum's L2 strategy
with stronger economic alignment through 50% protocol fees and
mandatory HYPE staking versus L2s paying minimal fees to Ethereum.

 X402 EXPLAINED IN 100 SECONDS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 x402 is an internet payments protocol that uses stablecoins to build
an ecosystem of interconnected services and AI agents that can pay one
another. 

 STABLECOINS STRENGTHEN, NOT THREATEN, US FINANCE (3 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Fears of stablecoins undermining US bank lending are misplaced as US
banks already hold trillions in reserves, giving them ample liquidity
to compete in a more efficient, stablecoin-enabled system. 

 STABLECOIN NEO BANKS ARE REPLACING TRADITIONAL CREDIT CARDS (4 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Crypto neobanks like Tria, Plasma One, EtherFi, and Gnosis Pay let
users spend stablecoins directly while earning high crypto rewards. 

 RISK CURATION IN DEFI - LOW MARGINS, HIGH RISK (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 We should question the sustainability of risk curator business models
in DeFi (platforms like Aave, SparkLend, and Gauntlet) as they
generate poor returns relative to total value locked (TVL).
