MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN ETFS ARE BLACKROCK'S TOP REVENUE SOURCE (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 BlackRock's Bitcoin ETFs became the firm's top revenue source despite
managing 1,400+ ETFs with $13.4 trillion in total assets. Allocations
are nearing $100 billion. IBIT launched in January 2024 and reached
$70 billion in assets in a record 341 days, currently sitting at $70.7
billion with net inflows exceeding $52 billion in its first year,
while generating an estimated $245 million in annual fees by October.
The ETF now holds over 3% of Bitcoin's total supply as BlackRock's own
Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio increased its IBIT stake by
14%. Recent outflows are attributed to expected retail behavior during
price drops rather than fundamental weakness. 

 UK CONFIRMS NEW CRYPTO REPORTING RULES (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The UK's 2025 Budget confirms Cryptoasset Reporting Framework
implementation from January 1, requiring UK-registered exchanges to
collect customer cryptocurrency transactions and tax reference
numbers, with HMRC forecasting £315 million ($417.3 million) in
additional tax revenue by April 2030. Investors failing to provide
details face £300 fines, while exchanges risk £300 per unreported
customer, and information collected in 2026 will be reported to HMRC
in 2027 to verify capital gains tax compliance. Experts warn
compliance costs will be passed to customers as exchanges struggle to
collect tax details from wary users, potentially driving some traders
toward noncompliant platforms until international alignment creates a
crypto equivalent to Common Reporting Standard and FATCA. Separately,
HMRC published a summary indicating the government leans toward
recognizing DeFi lending and staking as taxable only when gains are
realized through fiat conversion, though no final decision or timeline
has been set.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 VISA EXPANDING STABLECOIN SETTLEMENT ACROSS EMEA (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Visa partnered with crypto infrastructure provider Aquanow to expand
stablecoin settlement across Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle
East, and Africa, enabling 365-day settlement for issuers and
acquirers using approved stablecoins like USDC. The integration
eliminates weekend and holiday delays from traditional banking rails
as Visa's stablecoin settlement volume reached a $2.5 billion
annualized run rate, with plans to add four stablecoins across four
blockchains. 

 NON-CUSTODIAL USDT VISA CARD LAUNCHING IN EL SALVADOR (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Truther will launch a non-custodial USDT Visa card in El Salvador on
January 29, enabling real-time spending from self-custody wallets on
Polygon without preloading funds, charging 2% currency conversion fees
with no IOF tax for Brazilian users as it extends its $40 million
daily PIX-connected infrastructure. The card draws funds at the point
of purchase rather than requiring top-ups or custodial accounts.
Truther plans to migrate to the Liquid network for enhanced privacy
while expanding the Swapix API to Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, and
Russia, targeting 24/7 QR code-based payment systems. Its wallet
currently supports BTC, USDT, and Brazilian real stablecoins. Early
2025 integrations have been planned for tether gold and Argentine peso
tokens.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 TETHER'S INTEREST RATE TRADE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tether is running an interest rate trade – buying gold and Bitcoin,
anticipating Fed cuts that would crush their interest income. A 30%
decline in these positions would wipe out equity and render USDT
insolvent. However, its disclosed reserves operate under a "matching
philosophy", showing only liability backing. A separate undisclosed
equity balance sheet holds mining operations, equity investments, and
corporate reserves funded by $10 billion annual profits from $120
billion treasuries at 4% yields. Tether's equity, valued at $50-100
billion, provides a buffer sellable to cover balance sheet gaps. The
company operates at significantly higher collateralization than banks'
5-15% fractional reserves, despite lacking lender-of-last-resort
protection. 

 THE STATE OF ETHEREUM: DIGITAL OIL, L2S, TPS, ETFS, DATS (12 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Ethereum still dominates DeFi TVL and is rapidly integrating with
TradFi via spot ETFs and ETH treasury companies, but ETH has
underperformed BTC as investors debate how much value accrues to the
base layer vs L2s. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade aims to massively
increase throughput and data availability while making it cheaper to
run nodes, reinforcing Ethereum's role as the modular settlement and
Data availability (DA) layer for L2s and tokenized assets.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STABLECOIN YIELDS ON AAVE SLIDE BELOW T-BILLS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Stablecoin supply APYs on Aave v3 Ethereum have fallen from ~5% in
late summer to just above 3%, with USDC/USDT/DAI topping the pool and
newer stables like USDe, RLUSD, and USDS under 1.5%. Yields are
slightly better on some L2s, but in general, onchain stable rates now
sit below the 3-month US Treasury yield (~3.8%), signaling cooling
DeFi borrowing demand. 

 MONAD VS. “JUST ANOTHER L1” – KEONE RESPONDS TO HAYES (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Monad is meaningfully different from other L1s as it has sub-2s
finality with ~170 global validators, a from-scratch C++/Rust
codebase, and new consensus and execution designs. It aims to prove
that high throughput and decentralization are compatible. Furthermore,
MON's Coinbase sale was structured to favor broad distribution over
whales.
