MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BERNSTEIN SAYS 'NEXT LEG OF BITCOIN BULL MARKET IS LOADING' AS
POSITIVE CATALYSTS ALIGN (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bernstein analysts expect that the next phase of Bitcoin's bull
market will be driven by catalysts like the U.S. Crypto Task Force's
push for a National Bitcoin Reserve, potential sovereign wealth fund
investments in crypto, and growing institutional adoption. Bernstein
believes that because of strong ETF inflows, major corporate buys, and
increasing government involvement, they see Bitcoin as a challenger to
gold.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 DEEP DIVE INTO “BELIEFS” ON BASE (1 MINUTE READ) [7]

AI agents that uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Actively
Validated Services (AVSs) to ensure security and reliability. The

verifiable agency. Autonome also includes components like a registry,
message queue, and credit management.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE MEMECOIN CYCLE: IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT BEING EARLY (12 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 The memecoin market cycle of 2024-25 was driven by the pursuit of
being “early,” evolving from BONK's initial success through
increasingly absurd iterations like Dogwifhat and Fartcoin, before
culminating in celebrity-backed tokens like TRUMP and LIBRA. The cycle
progressed through phases from simple memes to engineered vitality,
with insider groups increasingly manipulating launches and metrics.
This hype cycle parallels the 2021 NFT cycle's evolution from
community-driven projects to celebrity cash-grabs. The market reached
its “twilight zone” when participants continued trading despite
recognizing the manipulation, suggesting its natural conclusion as
both peak absurdity and peak insider exploitation have been achieved. 

 LIBRA MEMECOIN TEAM PLOTTED NIGERIAN EXPANSION (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The team behind the controversial Libra memecoin, promoted by
Argentina's President Javier Milei, was reportedly working on a
similar project with Nigerian officials before the scandal derailed
their plans. As legal action mounts, with U.S. law firms preparing
class-action lawsuits and Argentina's opposition considering
impeachment, new links have emerged between Libra, Melania Trump's
memecoin, and the involvement of Kelsier Ventures.

 CRYPTO BEYOND TRADING PRODUCTS (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Outside of traditional trading applications, crypto is being used to
provide dollar access to those in emerging markets (stablecoins), prop
up decentralized social networks, enable direct creator monetization,
and develop onchain loyalty programs for brands. Projects like Zarpay,
Farcaster, Rodeo, and Blackbird have championed these new models,
demonstrating crypto's potential to reshape finance, social media, and
digital commerce. 

 COULD 'BASED ROLLUPS' SOLVE ETHEREUM'S LAYER-2 PROBLEM? (5 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Based rollups aim to address Ethereum's L2 fragmentation by using
Ethereum's existing validator set to sequence and confirm transactions
instead of relying on centralized sequencers. Based rollups allow
near-instant cross-rollup communication within the same Ethereum
block. While it promises improved interoperability and security, there
are technical challenges around the need to generate proofs quickly,
potential MEV exploitation by L1 block proposers, and a lack of
incentive alignment for L2s.
