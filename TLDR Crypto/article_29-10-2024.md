MARKETS & BUSINESS

 MARC ANDREESSEN SHOUTOUTS HELP AI-POWERED VC FUND AI16Z TO NEARLY
$100 MILLION MARKET CAP (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The ai16z fund, an AI-powered venture capital fund on Daos.fun
modeled after Marc Andreessen, surged to a market cap of nearly $100
million after an endorsement by Andreessen. It has since dropped to
$50 million amid ongoing volatility. The fund operates on
community-driven investment suggestions, where the AI weights advice
based on members' token holdings and past performance. The project
aims to eventually automate trade execution. 

 HONG KONG PLEDGES MORE LICENSES FOR CRYPTO EXCHANGES BY YEAR-END (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) plans to grant
more licenses to digital asset exchanges by the end of 2024 following
a rigorous inspection period that saw slow approvals due to regulatory
concerns. Licensed exchanges will undergo a third-party review before
expanding operations. The SFC will establish a consultative panel in
early 2025 to enhance collaboration within the crypto sector.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INFINEX FINISHES THEIR PATRON SALE, RAISING $67M (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Infinex has successfully completed a $67.7 million Patron Sale with
backing from major players across the crypto ecosystem, including
founders, funds, and foundations. This funding aims to fuel Infinex's
vision for a “post-CEX era” that shifts away from centralized
exchanges, with supporters now able to access their Patron tokens on
Magic Eden, Blur, and OpenSea. 

 LOCAL FEE MARKETS IN ETHEREUM (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new proposal suggests enhancing Ethereum's fee mechanism by
implementing local fee markets that apply multipliers to transactions
involving frequently accessed addresses consuming more than 1/16th of
a block's gas. It would build upon EIP-1559 by introducing dynamic fee
multipliers that compound when addresses exceed the threshold. While
it aims to improve network fairness and congestion management,
potential challenges include implementation complexity and resistance
from popular applications.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MAPLE GUIDE FOR 2030 (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Maple aims to revolutionize the institutional lending landscape by
2030, using blockchain to create transparent, efficient, and
accessible credit markets that democratize access to capital for
sectors like AI, space exploration, and sustainable infrastructure.
With the launch of the SYRUP token, Maple hopes to facilitate $100B in
annual loan volume, establish decentralized bond markets, and
integrate yield opportunities across fintech applications, positioning
itself as a global leader in onchain credit. 

 Q4 WATCHLIST: AI X MEME CULTS, SOLANA'S DOMINANCE, DEFI 1.0'S
COMEBACK, AND MORE (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The crypto market is seeing renewed momentum in Q4 2024 driven by the
emergence of AI and crypto integrations and Base's dominance of the L2
space. Notable developments include Solana's expanding DeFi ecosystem
led by Jupiter and Kamino, the revival of DeFi 1.0 protocols like Aave
and Uniswap, and a notably bullish market sentiment as evidenced by
onchain metrics and Stripe's acquisition of Bridge

MISCELLANEOUS

 UNICHAIN AND THE MODERN CRYPTO STACK (35 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Unichain is a great example of the modern crypto infrastructure
stack. It owns the application and protocol layer, leaving only the L1
as an outsourced resource for settlement. Over time, more apps and
protocols will become independent since they have a greater moat than
a general-purpose platform. Uniswap resembles a platform where they
have control over key components, but leave room for external
composability and bases to build things on top. 

 POSSIBLE FUTURES OF THE ETHEREUM PROTOCOL, PART 5: THE PURGE (27
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ethereum's “Purge” initiative aims to address the challenge of
blockchain bloat, with proposals focusing on history expiry, state
expiry, and feature cleanup. Full nodes currently require 1.1
terabytes for execution data and several hundred gigabytes for
consensus data. Key solutions include EIP-4444, which aims to limit
historical data storage to one year, and transitioning to a
distributed storage model. More complex expiry proposals require
address format changes. There are significant technical challenges
around backwards compatibility and maintaining Ethereum's permanence
guarantees.
