 EUROPE ACCELERATES DIGITAL EURO PLANS AFTER U.S. STABLECOIN LAW (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The EU is fast-tracking its digital euro initiative in response to
the U.S. GENIUS Act, which set strict rules for stablecoin issuers and
reinforced the dollar's dominance in cross-border payments. Officials
are now debating whether to issue the digital euro on public
blockchains like Ethereum or Solana to boost efficiency and adoption,
though concerns remain over privacy risks versus a closed ECB-led
system. The decision could shape Europe's competitiveness in the
global digital payments race. 

 PHILIPPINES PROPOSES 10,000 BTC STRATEGIC RESERVE WITH 20-YEAR LOCKUP
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Philippines Congressman Miguel Luis Villafuerte has introduced a bill
calling for the central bank to buy 2,000 BTC annually over five
years, creating a 10,000 BTC reserve locked for 20 years. The bitcoin
would only be used to retire government debt, with strict limits on
sales even after the lockup period. If passed, the Philippines would
join El Salvador and Bhutan in treating bitcoin as a strategic
national asset.

 DUAL FLOW BATCH AUCTION (35 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Dual Flow Batch Auction (DFBA) is a novel market structure that
addresses critical flaws in blockchain-based Continuous Limit Order
Books, including MEV exploitation, latency arbitrage, and adverse flow
that drive up trading costs. The system separates orders into maker
and taker groups, conducting two independent auctions every ~100ms
where makers compete purely on price rather than speed, eliminating
time-priority advantages and allowing market makers to quote tighter
spreads with reduced exposure to toxic flow. DFBA provides uniform
pricing within each auction (all participants fill at the same
clearing price) while maintaining efficient liquidity provision, with
analysis suggesting auction intervals of 100ms-1s are optimal for
natural flow traders who see negligible benefit from lower latencies.
This design represents a fundamental shift away from speed-based
competition toward fair pricing mechanisms that better serve actual
trading needs rather than optimizing for bots and block producers. 

 INTEGRATING 3-SLOT FINALITY WITH EPBS, FOCIL, AND PEERDAS (25 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Researchers Luca Zanolini and Roberto Saltini explore integrating
Ethereum's proposed Three-Slot Finality protocol with three other
major upgrades: enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS),
Fork-Choice Inclusion Lists (FOCIL), and PeerDAS, aiming to achieve
finality in just three slots while maintaining censorship resistance
and data availability. The integration requires restructuring slot
timelines to accommodate builder-proposer separation, introducing an
Availability Committee to verify payload release, and modifying the
RLMD-GHOST fork-choice algorithm to handle different payload
availability states. While the authors believe the combination
preserves 3SF's core security properties under assumptions of
synchrony and reduced adversarial resilience, they identify a critical
challenge around low validator participation scenarios where builders
may struggle to reach the 60% threshold needed for safe payload
release.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 GENIUS WAS JUST THE PROLOGUE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stablecoins represent a fundamental platform shift comparable to
historical infrastructure transformations like railroads and the
internet, with the recent GENIUS Act passage marking just the
beginning of mainstream adoption. Legacy financial rails like wire
transfers and ACH are inadequate for modern needs requiring
composability and machine-to-machine transactions, while stablecoins
offer instant settlement, programmability, and borderless
functionality that will unlock trillions in economic activity. AI
agents will accelerate this transition by natively using stablecoins
for automated commerce and treasury operations, creating an entirely
new category of "AI-native" economic activity. Despite the current
$280 billion stablecoin market cap, the industry is still
underestimating the speed of adoption given the 100:1 gap with the $20
trillion US M2 money supply, positioning stablecoins as the
foundational layer for the future digital economy. 

 COINBASE INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS (12 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Markets pulled back ahead of Jackson Hole amid macro headwinds, with
the US Treasury rebuilding its General Account balance by $185B since
early August, while Fed rate cut odds dropped from 96% to 70%,
contributing to $756M and $867M in BTC and ETH ETF outflows,
respectively. Circle launched Gateway, making USDC effectively
chain-agnostic with sub-500ms cross-chain transfers that could save
large exchanges up to $40M annually per $1B of float by eliminating
rebalancing costs and reducing safety stock requirements. Despite spot
weakness, ETH derivatives markets showed strength with 9% annualized
funding rates and open interest hitting new all-time highs at $125.5B
globally, suggesting crypto-native traders are buying the dip.
Gateway's initial lack of Solana support may strategically benefit EVM
chains in capturing multi-chain institutional flows until Circle
expands coverage or prioritizes its upcoming Arc L1.

 STARGATE DAO APPROVES LAYERZERO ACQUISITION (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Stargate DAO approved LayerZero Foundation's $120 million acquisition
offer with nearly 95% of votes, despite last-minute competing bids
from Wormhole, Axelar, and Across protocols. Under the modified deal
terms, STG holders will swap tokens for ZRO at a 1:0.08634 ratio, with
veSTG holders receiving 50% of Stargate's revenue for six months
before all excess revenue goes toward ZRO buybacks. The competing
protocols requested a vote pause to submit proper bids, but the DAO
proceeded with the original timeline, completing what LayerZero claims
is the first private DAO acquisition over $100 million. There is some
controversy about the lack of consideration of the other protocols'
proposals, though, given that Stargate is built using LayerZero's
interoperability technology, this outcome was not unexpected. 

 WESTERN UNION EYES STABLECOINS AS REMITTANCE MOAT SHRINKS (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 With revenue down 25% as digital-first rivals like Wise and Remitly
take share, Western Union (WU) is piloting stablecoin settlement in
South America and Africa. Its edge isn't the tech - others can adopt
stablecoins too - but instead its 400K global cash agent network,
which could make WU the key bridge from cash to stablecoins for
individuals and fintechs. This pivot could buy time against the
decline of cash while positioning WU as infrastructure for the digital
economy.
