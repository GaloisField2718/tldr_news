MARKETS & BUSINESS

 MEMECOIN MADNESS RETURNS AS BARSTOOL SPORTS, BNB CHAIN, AND AN ENTIRE
AFRICAN COUNTRY DABBLE WITH MEME TOKENS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Memecoins have yet again taken center stage, with a BNB chain
tutorial token (TST) reaching a $300 million market cap and getting a
Binance listing after it was used in a video and mentioned by founder
Chengpeng Zhao. Barstool Sports' David Portnoy promoted JAILSTOOL,
which peaked at $200 million and has since fallen. Most surprisingly,
the Central African Republic's president announced a national memecoin
(CAR) that surpassed a $500 million market cap, though questions about
its authenticity remain. 

 INSIDE LOOK AT A HISTORICAL LIQUIDATION EVENT (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A historic liquidation event in the crypto market wiped out $14
billion in open interest within 24 hours, with ETH contracts
experiencing the most volatility. Ethena successfully navigated the
turmoil, capturing profits from discounted perpetual futures contracts
and proving the resilience of USDe, which remained stable throughout
the sell-off.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 KHALANI: INTENT-DRIVEN GENERATIVE COORDINATION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Khalani Arcadia has introduced an intent-driven protocol suite that
makes blockchain-adjacent agent networks into collaborative solver
networks through its Arcadia Intents Protocol (AIP). It allows for
coordination between offchain agents while maintaining onchain
settlement guarantees. The architecture includes “SolverFi,” a
novel mechanism for handling complex strategies and multi-chain
operations through specialized solver networks. Its vision is that
DeFi protocols interact through intent-based coordination rather than
direct integration. 

 PENDLE 2025: ZENITH (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Pendle experienced massive growth in 2024, with TVL increasing 20x to
$4.4B and daily trading volume surging 100x to nearly $100M,
establishing itself as a dominant player in DeFi yield trading. The
protocol is now expanding through three strategic initiatives:
enhancing V2 with permissionless listings and dynamic fees, launching
Citadels to target non-EVM ecosystems and institutional markets, and
introducing Boros as a new product to capture the $150B perpetual
futures funding rate market. Pendle aims to become a comprehensive
yield layer for both crypto-native and traditional finance users.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 NEW SATOSHI WALLET INSIGHTS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new onchain analysis of Satoshi Nakamoto's wallet reveals potential
connections to CaVirtEx, a Canadian exchange later acquired by Kraken.
The research estimates Satoshi controls 1.096M BTC (worth over $100B),
with evidence of last onchain activity in 2014, including 24
documented outbound transactions and 200 BTC sent to the Bitcoin
faucet. Satoshi's connections to a centralized exchange were
previously unknown and suggest that Kraken may possess relevant KYC
information from its acquisition. 

 LAUNCHING AN AGENT ON VIRTUALS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The article explains how to launch an AI Agent on Virtuals,
discussing tokenomics, bonding curve mechanics, and the importance of
using at least 40% of the token supply to "align long-term
incentives". Teams must balance financial investment with operational
sustainability to make sure they have enough runway for development,
marketing, and liquidity while graduating from the bonding curve to a
Uniswap pool.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NO MORE ALLOWING UNVESTED TOKENS TO BE STAKED (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Unvested tokens should never be stakeable since this practice
undermines trust and needs to be eliminated for pre-launch projects.
There should be a move away from large unlock cliffs that create
market panic and instead implement smooth, linear vesting after year
one. These changes would make token markets more predictable, stable,
and less prone to FUD. 

 MEMECOINS: FROM FUN PVP TO PREDATORY INSIDER GAMES (1 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Memecoins once functioned like high-RTP casino games, giving casual
players a real shot at big wins. However, with insiders now dominating
launches and draining the odds, the game has turned predatory,
stripping away the thrill and fairness that made it fun in the first
place.

 Many previously popular blockchain networks, like Harmony (-99.9% TVL

large decreases in their total value locked (TVL), while even major

because of backlash over KYC requirements in certain jurisdictions.
