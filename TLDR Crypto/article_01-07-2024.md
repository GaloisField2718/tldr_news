MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC SUES CONSENSYS OVER STAKING SERVICES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The SEC has filed a lawsuit against Consensys, the parent company of
MetaMask, accusing it of operating as an unregistered broker and
engaging/facilitating in unregistered securities sales through
MetaMask Swaps and Staking since 2020. The SEC claims that Consensys
collected over $250 million in fees through these activities without
the required registrations, thus denying investors essential legal
protections. 

 WHY VCS ARE SO BULLISH ON THE TON TOKEN (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 VCs like Pantera Capital are particularly excited about TON as a
distribution play due to its exclusive integration with Telegram and
its 900 million monthly active users. It's slowly becoming a hub for
mini-apps in gaming, payments, and other use cases that could explode
in popularity overnight. The network is still in its early stages. Its
most significant risk is being solely reliant on Telegram, and
therefore app issuers Apple and Google, for support.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ORBIT SSF: SOLO-STAKING-FRIENDLY VALIDATOR SET MANAGEMENT FOR SSF (34
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Orbit SSF uses a stable core of large validators and a rotating group
of smaller validators to achieve high economic security with a
smaller, but still sufficient, number of nodes so that single slot
finality is not constrained by validator set economics. It selects
validators based on proportionate balance, adjusts rewards for proper
compensation, and uses issuance curves to incentivize consolidation
without overly penalizing smaller validators. 

 INTRODUCING PAY ON WARPCAST (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Warpcast has introduced a new feature where users can now pay someone
with USDC in under 10 seconds using an existing wallet on a
mobile-first platform. This will help eliminate the need to remember
addresses.

critical role in crypto investing. He outlines essential metrics to
diligence like total token supply, token types (inflationary vs.
deflationary), and distribution methods, emphasizing the need to

 GRAYSCALE'S Q3 2024 INSIGHT REPORT SUMMARY (3 MINUTE READ) [11]

drivers, and market dynamics for various tokens. ETFs and significant
DeFi activity have positively impacted Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the ETH
ecosystem. Idiosyncratic tokens like TON, SOL, and PENDLE have seen
strong adoption and price increases. The report also includes
Grayscale's Top 20 research-driven investment picks.

 EPOCHS AND SLOTS ALL THE WAY DOWN: WAYS TO GIVE ETHEREUM USERS FASTER
TRANSACTION CONFIRMATION TIMES (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Ethereum blocks confirm within 5-20 seconds, though applications like
rollups could benefit from sub-second latency. Single-slot finality
improves block finality from 13 minutes to 15 seconds and makes
Ethereum consensus look closer to Tendermint, but adds significant
load to the communication layer. Based preconfirmations allow Ethereum
validators to offer promises about the eventual inclusion of a
transaction into a future block. L2s should optimize for Ethereum's
base layer properties, be a ‚Äúserver with blockchain scaffolding,‚Äù
or compromise with a fast chain and Ethereum
interoperability/security. 

 CRYPTO-POWERED STATUS GAMES (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This author explores the interplay between social and financial
capital in social finance (SocialFi) platforms, emphasizing the design
space for creating engaging, high-skill information games that can
financialize social networks. They categorize social platforms into
four types ‚Äî cozyweb, influencer, professional, and earner ‚Äî based
on their focus on social versus financial capital and whether the
dynamics are implicit or explicit.
