MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE BUYS ECHO FOR $375M TO EXPAND ONCHAIN FUNDRAISING (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Coinbase has acquired Echo, the Cobie-founded onchain fundraising
platform, for $375 million, marking its biggest push yet into
community-driven and tokenized fundraising. Echo has powered over $200
million across 300 deals, letting startups raise capital directly from
users through private rounds or public token sales via its Sonar
product. The platform will remain independent but integrate with
Coinbase to offer founders streamlined capital tools and investors
access to early-stage deals. Coinbase also plans to extend Echo's
infrastructure to support tokenized securities and real-world assets. 

 TETHER REACHES 500M USERS AS SUPPLY NEARS $182B (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 USDT has passed 500 million users, and now has a total supply of
nearly $182 billion, more than double Circle's $75B USDC. Tether is
also reportedly seeking to raise $20 billion at a $500B valuation,
which would place it among the world's most valuable private
companies, ahead of its planned USAT stablecoin launch for US users
later this year.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SIMD-0266: EFFICIENT TOKEN PROGRAM (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Solana's SIMD-0266 proposal introduces p-token, a complete
reimplementation of the SPL Token program that reduces compute unit
usage by up to 98% through zero heap allocations, zero-copy data
access, and full backward compatibility, without any client code
changes. The Token program currently consumes approximately 10% of
block compute units, with p-token cutting this to a fraction and
freeing nearly 12% of block space for other transactions to directly
increase Solana's effective throughput. Performance improvements range
from 98.4% reduction for Transfer/TransferChecked instructions
consuming only 76-105 CU versus 4,645-6,200 CU currently. The upgrade
has completed extensive testing, including existing SPL Token test
fixtures, Firedancer fuzzing with millions of mainnet instruction
replays, and three security audits from Neodyme and Zellic. 

 THE FED JUST OPENED THE DOOR TO CRYPTO (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller declared that crypto and
distributed ledgers are now “woven into the fabric” of US finance,
signaling a major policy shift toward embracing digital assets. The
central bank is entering “a new era” where DeFi innovators are
welcome to shape the future of payments instead of being sidelined.
Waller proposed a “skinny master account”, a limited-access
payment account for fintechs and crypto firms that would connect
directly to Fed payment rails without full banking privileges. The
move reflects the Fed's broader retreat from anti-crypto stances and
could open the door for regulated blockchain-native payment systems to
plug directly into US monetary infrastructure.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HYPERLIQUID: STABLECOIN WARS (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hyperliquid's stablecoin supply has shifted from collateralized debt
positions like feUSD to LayerZero-bridged USDT0 to Circle's native
USDC and now toward Hyperliquid-aligned stablecoins. USDH reached $25
million market cap in its first week after the September 22 launch,
but has since declined to $20.9 million. The Aligned Stablecoin
framework proposes 20% lower taker fees, 50% higher maker rebates, and
20% more volume contribution toward fee tiers for stablecoins that
stake 1 million HYPE, share at least 50% offchain yield with
Hyperliquid, maintain fiat backing, and focus exclusively on growth
without competing interests. USDH's growth path includes short-term
HyperEVM DeFi adoption competing with USDT0, medium-term acceptance as
collateral across HIP-3 exchanges like trade.xyz, and long-term
potential to challenge USDC's $4.81 billion HyperCore collateral
monopoly. 

 NATION-STATE MALWARE HIDING ON BLOCKCHAINS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google Threat Intelligence Group has observed a North Korean threat
actor using EtherHiding to deliver malware and backdoors for
cryptocurrency theft, marking the first nation-state adoption of this
technique that stores malicious JavaScript payloads in blockchain
smart contracts to create a decentralized, resilient
command-and-control infrastructure. EtherHiding leverages blockchain
immutability and read-only functions to fetch payloads without
creating traceable transactions or paying gas fees, making
conventional takedowns impossible while allowing attackers to update
malware by simply modifying smart contracts. The attack chain targets
developers through fake job interviews where victims download
malicious npm packages containing downloaders that query blockchain
smart contracts for second-stage payloads, ultimately deploying
backdoors for remote system control and credential stealers targeting
cryptocurrency wallets, like MetaMask and Phantom, along with browser
passwords and password managers.

 HOW SYNTHETIX, RONIN, AND CELO SAW THE LIGHT (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Synthetix is returning to the Ethereum mainnet to tap enormous
liquidity that never migrated to L2s despite years of expansion across
Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and SNAXchain. 86% of Aave's revenue is
still generated on L1, demonstrating whales' preference for the
mainnet's security over L2 bridge risks. Ronin is becoming an Optimism
Superchain L2 in early 2026 to save $35 million in annual staking
rewards while supporting 100 games for 350,000 daily active addresses.
The move cuts security costs 99.8% while redirecting validator
emissions toward developer incentives and high-value users. 

 PRIVACY AS THE NEXT SCALING FACTOR FOR CRYPTO (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto collapsed the natural observability gradient that historically
made privacy the default state by driving observation costs to zero
through globally visible, verifiable, and permanent blockchain
records, creating unprecedented conditions where markets operate under
perfect permanent observation that causes participants to act for
audiences rather than themselves and over-correlate around shared
signals. This flattening of the multi-dimensional economy into a
shared feed eliminates behavioral diversity critical for system
scaling as actors coordinate around what is seen instead of what is
desired, demonstrating Goodhart's Law and reflexivity at scale when
every participant responds to identical information. Zero-knowledge
proofs and trusted execution environments enable programmable
observability where visibility becomes a design variable rather than
default condition, allowing actors to choose what to reveal and when
similar to how SSL scaled the web by restoring communication privacy.

 THE POLITICS OF “ETHEREUM ALIGNMENT” (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Projects that create independent value or accrue utility to their own
tokens are often branded as competitors, while ETH-centric ventures,
like restaking protocols with minimal user impact, are praised as
“aligned.” 

 TOP NEOBANKS RANKED (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Self-custodial and low-fee platforms like Gnosis Pay, Ether.fi, UR
Global, and THORWallet are S-tier, while centralized or outdated
options like Crypto.com and Bybit fall to D-tier. 

 AAVE DOMINATES ETHEREUM LENDING WITH $25B IN LOANS (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Aave has cemented its dominance in Ethereum's lending market, now

from roughly 1,000 daily borrowers.

staking rewards to 5,671 ETH since launching its Ethereum treasury
strategy in June.
