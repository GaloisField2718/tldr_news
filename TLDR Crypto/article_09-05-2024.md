 NEARLY ALL FTX CREDITORS WILL GET 118% OF THEIR FUNDS BACK IN CASH,
ESTATE SAYS IN NEW PLAN (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Former crypto exchange FTX has proposed a plan to see 98% of
creditors receive 118% of their claims. Other non-governmental
creditors would get 100% of claims plus up to 9% interest if the
bankruptcy court approves the plan. The money was accrued by selling
various FTX assets, like its stake in AI company Anthropic. FTX's lack
of BTC and ETH holdings at the time of bankruptcy prevented it from
seeing asset appreciation due to recently rising prices.

forward strip is a sufficient timeframe for hedging while
consolidating liquidity across speculators. Since the blob gas fee is
prone to manipulation, the supply of contracts must be limited.
Sellers exposed to asymmetric risk must be protected somehow, possibly
through an insurance fund.
