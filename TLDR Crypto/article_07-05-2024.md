 SEC ISSUES ROBINHOOD CRYPTO A WELLS NOTICE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Robinhood Crypto received a Wells Notice from the SEC, signaling a
potential enforcement action for alleged securities violations. The
notice is one of many that the SEC has recently issued to crypto firms
(e.g., UniSwap & Consensys) challenging the classification of digital
assets on their platforms. 

 LOW ETH GAS FEES DRIVE BURN TO YEARLY LOW (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ethereum's daily ETH burn rate has hit a yearly low, mainly due to
significantly reduced gas fees (gas on Ethereum is now 5 to 10 gwei).
The decrease in gas fees, the lowest this year, is affecting the
network's deflationary mechanism established by the London hard fork.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 USDH, THE FIRST BITCOIN-BACKED SYNTHETIC DOLLAR, SET TO LAUNCH IN
JUNE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hermetica is launching the first Bitcoin-backed synthetic dollar,
USDh, in June, offering a 25% yield to users. It argues the yield is
sustainable because it is based on futures funding rates and a demand
for Bitcoin futures. The company says that USDh will be a pivotal
asset for increasing liquidity and functionality in Bitcoin DeFi. 

 3JANE â€“ A PATH FORWARD FOR EIGENLAYER (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 3Jane is a derivatives protocol that allows users to collateralize
yield-bearing ETH in options contracts, earning options premiums on
top of staking and restaking yield. By sourcing yield within DeFi
derivatives, 3Jane mitigates the opportunity costs of holding restaked
ETH and alleviates the burden off AVS security budgets. It is a proof
of concept of the potential of tokenizing cryptoeconomic security and
derivatives on a shared ledger.

 HORIZONTAL VS VERTICAL SCALING: THE NEW MODULAR VS MONOLITHIC (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Modularity is a horizontal scaling technique that breaks blockchain
down to its core components to make block creation more efficient.
Vertical scaling involves increasing the hardware requirements of
nodes and optimizing on the software level. Both modular and
monolithic chains can employ horizontal and vertical scaling
techniques. The endgame of Ethereum scalability will combine
horizontal scaling through sharding and vertical scaling through
parallelized VMs, which the =nil; L2 is working towards by
incorporating modularity, zkSharding, and intra-shard parallelization.


 THE POWER OF THE EIGEN TOKEN (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article discusses EigenLayer's "Universal Intersubjective Work
Token" ($EIGEN) and its significance, breaking down its key features
and complexities into 30 tweets. It explains how $EIGEN transforms
Ethereum's $ETH into a universal objective work token, allowing for
validation of external services and addressing intersubjective faults
through a dual-token model while incorporating mechanisms like forking
and social consensus.

 SOME THOUGHTS ON THE MEMECOIN NARRATIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The memecoin ecosystem has expanded dramatically since 2020-21, when
the only options were DOGE, SHIB, and a few other Ethereum-based
tokens. New tooling has made creating memecoins significantly easier,
requiring no coding skills, and new token standards like Runes and
DN404 create more opportunities for unique designs. Supply far
outstrips demand, making memecoins a high-risk, low-reward
opportunity.
