MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TORNADO CASH DEV ROMAN STORM FOUND GUILTY ON ONE COUNT (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 A New York jury found Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm guilty of
operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, but they
acquitted him of sanctions violations and were deadlocked on money
laundering charges. The partial verdict spares Storm from a potential
20-year sentence but leaves him facing up to five years. The defense
counsel argued Storm had no control over the decentralized protocol,
which was used for both privacy and illicit purposes. The decision is
seen as a partial win for crypto developers, highlighting the legal
ambiguity around building open-source privacy tools. Sentencing is
pending, and the DOJ may still retry the unresolved charge. 

 SEC GREENLIGHTS LIQUID STAKING, UNLOCKS INSTITUTIONAL PARTICIPATION
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The SEC clarified that receipt tokens from liquid staking aren't
securities if the underlying activities are “ministerial or
administrative,” effectively greenlighting protocol-driven LST
platforms. This unlocks institutional strategies like earning 5–15%
staking yields while maintaining liquidity, solving a key treasury
obstacle. Liquid restaking on Ethereum has surged to $24B TVL, and the
new guidance is expected to accelerate that growth.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AXAL – A SMARTER WAY TO SAVE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Axal is a new stablecoin savings account leveraging DeFi positions to
earn a 6-10% yield. Axal acts as a curator of protocols and
automatically allocates funds to the appropriate pools to earn high
yield at adjusted risk. Currently, the yield sources include Morpho,
Aave, and Euler, though there are plans to further expand the
strategies and yield sources. 

 INTRODUCING THE SUPERFORM FOUNDATION (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Superform Foundation was established as a legally independent
Cayman foundation to guide Superform's permissionless infrastructure
and accelerate decentralization of its consumer finance protocols. It
will steward core infrastructure, expand the ecosystem through
integrations, grants, and incentive programs, and develop governance
and token-utility frameworks for $UP holders. The Foundation will also
drive a gradual shift toward community-led governance with full
transparency over decisions, treasury operations, and roadmap
priorities. Upcoming deliverables include a tokenomics paper, protocol
documentation, core governance proposals, and activation of token
functionality to coordinate protocol growth.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BALAJI ON TOKENIZED IPOS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lina Khan's decision to block a major acquisition forced startups
like Figma to scale independently, creating outsized value for
employees and investors. While some argue Adobe's purchase might have
delivered greater returns, proponents counter that in a power-law
world, you only need one home run to justify a policy. Balaji calls
for easier IPO access, ideally via crypto-native equity markets, to
reverse the decline in US listings and avoid the regulatory complexity
that entrenches Big Tech. He warns that antitrust interventions and
baroque deal structures ultimately strengthen incumbents and that
crypto exchanges could supplant traditional capital markets. 

 BEST HYPE YIELDS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 beHYPE campaigns on HyperBeat (20% of the airdrop) and Spectra
Finance (29% APR until August 30) reward early depositors with
tradable points via Rumpel Labs. Leveraged wstHYPE farming on
Sentiment can net an 82.5% APR looped yield, while Pendle offers a
3.11% ROI over 85 days for long-term exposure with exit optionality.
Felix Protocol's stability pool provides 16% organic APR on feUSD and
discounted HYPE from liquidations. Advanced users can deploy
delta-neutral positions – combining fixed-rate farming with shorting
– to lock in 15-26% net yields while farming additional ecosystem
points.

 HYPERLIQUID: THE ECONOMICS OF TRUST (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Hyperliquid addresses the industry's “extraction meta,” where
speculative token launches and founder dumps erode market trust, by
operating without private backers and sustaining continuous buybacks
through its Assistance Fund. Its buyback rate is set to repurchase the
entire circulating supply in under four years, backed by real revenue
and an integrity-driven team, which attracts serious, long-term
holders. By aligning incentives around transparent, risk-capital
commitment rather than hype-driven speculation, it restores the
foundational trust that underpins viable crypto markets. In doing so,
Hyperliquid positions itself as a rare, credible store-of-value token
amid a landscape of extractive projects. 

 AAVE BASE USDC DEPOSITS HIT $200M AFTER INCENTIVE CAMPAIGN (1 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 USDC deposits on Aave's Base deployment increased 22.7% to a record
$200M following the launch of the Base Incentive Campaign on July 23.
Framed as an ongoing “arms race” for DeFi dominance on Base, the
campaign pits Aave's yield-backed growth model against competitors
allegedly burning governance tokens. While the rivalry unfolds, users
benefit from the boosted incentives and attractive yields, evidence of
how protocol wars can drive adoption.
