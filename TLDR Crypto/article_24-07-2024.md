 BLOCKFI ADMINISTRATOR SUBMITS PLAN IN COURT TO MAKE CUSTOMERS WHOLE
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 BlockFi is finalizing its bankruptcy distribution, which would make
customers and unsecured creditors whole. It was one of the first
companies to go bankrupt after the collapse of FTX in November 2022.
BlockFi can fully compensate customers partly because its $847 million
in claims against FTX was monetized at a substantial premium to face
value.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 EXPLORING CIRCLE STARKS (18 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Circle STARKs are a new way to make blockchain proofs faster and more
efficient. They use smaller numbers to optimize speed and a
‚Äúcircle‚Äù structure for calculations to overcome security
challenges and reduce wasted space in computational traces.
Researchers are looking at how to make these proofs more user-friendly
for use with operations like hashing or signing.

availability sampling. It already supports integrations with all top
L2 chains, RaaS providers, and frameworks. The AVAIL token is used to
pay for DA fees and earn staking rewards. Avail also aims to become a
permissionless unification layer for web3 through Avail Nexus'
cross-chain transaction feature and Avail Fusion's shared security.

 REPORT ON BITCOIN OWNERSHIP (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In a survey of over 3,500 US adults, Bitcoin ownership was found
across political identities, ethnicity, income, and education levels.
Owners tended toward young and male. People who owned Bitcoin had
significantly higher knowledge and trust in it. Overall, Bitcoin
owners, who make up 14% of the population, are moderate, average
Americans. 

 THE FUTURE OF DEX TRADING - A UNISWAPX CASE STUDY (8 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Since UnixwapX's launch almost a year ago, offchain liquidity has
been integrated into the largest DEX, but the AMM still accounts for
60-80% of total volume. Despite lower fees and price settings on CEXs,
ETH/USDC trading on Uniswap shows nearly 30% volume filled by the AMM,
possibly due to stale prices and filler economics, indicating
potential shifts with the move to L2s.

 HOW NOT TO REKT YOUR USERS WITH INCENTIVES ON THE LENDING MARKET (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Recently, incentive rewards on Aave created non-organic behavior that
resulted in -330% APR for looping borrowers. Fluid, in contrast, is
implementing a more sustainable approach by incentivizing ETH lenders
rather than borrowers, enabled by its shared pool liquidity and vault
system. Its flexible architecture allows more changeable markets to
respond sustainably to user behaviors and avoid sudden disruptions.
