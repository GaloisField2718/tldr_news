 WHAT COMES AFTER THE WEB (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article explores the evolution of the Internet and proposes a
new concept called the Glocal Web. It discusses the limitations of
current cloud-based systems and contrasts two emerging approaches:
strongly global Web3 and local-first internet. The Glocal Web combines
both using Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) as a core
technology, promising to offer benefits like ownership, scalability,
low latency, offline availability, and privacy. 

 IS ETH NO LONGER ULTRA-SOUND MONEY? (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 August was one of the worst months for Ethereum mainnet fee
generation since early 2020. Since blobs, L2s no longer pay meaningful
ETH fees, though they continue to grow in value capture and
transaction execution. However, it is generally good that fees are not
prohibitively high, and its actual value could come from being the
money of choice for L2s. With a current inflation rate of around 1%,
it is no longer ultra-sound money but is still more sustainable than
alt L1s.
