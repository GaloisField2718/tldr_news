 GARY GENSLER SAYS IT'S OUR FAULT THE SEC APPEARS SO FOCUSED ON CRYPTO
(3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In an appearance on CNBC, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said he believes
there is a disproportionate amount of scams, fraud, and media
attention in crypto compared to its market cap. He believes that the
attention given to the SEC's crypto enforcement is a function of the
fact that that's where the media's attention is and that he is
frequently asked about crypto by financial media. Gensler did not
comment on recent Wells notices or lawsuits facing Robinhood,
Consensys, and others.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SIMPLE SELF-CUSTODIAL WALLET LAUNCH (2 MINUTE READ) [6]

self-custodial crypto wallet designed to simplify DEX interactions

user-friendliness, abstracting complex details like switching between

 EIP-7702: A NEW ALTERNATIVE TO 3074 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 EIP-3074 is an upgrade for normal Ethereum wallets that adds some
smart wallet functionality. It was slated for inclusion in the next
Ethereum upgrade. After it was approved, Vitalik Buterin and other
Ethereum researchers expressed concern about compatibility between
3074 and 4337 (standard smart contract wallet) wallets and the
potential of 3074 to be broken by quantum computers. EIP-7702 fixes
both of these issues.

 4 BIG TAKEAWAYS FROM FARCON (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Farcon was the first conference for the decentralized social media
protocol Farcaster. Greater personalization is coming to Web3, with
services like Daylight creating a more unique and catered Web3
experience. As part of its growth strategy, Farcaster is creating
Legos for developers to build on, like its frames feature. It is
encouraging users to take as many chances as possible and try out
several apps and mechanisms to increase consumer adoption. 

 UNFILTERED THOUGHTS ON BERACHAIN (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 One of the biggest issues for new DeFi protocols is bootstrapping
liquidity. Much like how EigenLayer connects ETH validators with Web3
protocols for economic security, Berachain's Proof of Liquidity system
allows DeFi protocols to get liquidity from validators through a
staked token pool. BGT is a staking and governance token, which is
non-transferable and rewarded to liquidity providers, and BERA is a
gas token. The liquidity flywheel is expected to work as long as the
APRs on liquidity provision are sufficiently high.

 WHY PEOPLE ARE TRADING MEME COINS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This thread discusses the phenomenon of trading meme coins,
attributing it to a broader trend of disillusionment among young
people due to economic disparities and unfulfilled promises. It
suggests that trading meme coins represents a response to a perceived
failure of previous generations, exacerbated by regulatory hurdles and
privatized opportunities. 

 WHY THIS CYCLE IS COOKED (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Points-based airdrops create a rift between private and public
markets as the abundance of VC funding and lack of new market entrants
incentivize companies to stay private longer and open at multi-billion
dollar valuations. The SEC's regulatory pressure has further
exacerbated this issue by making it harder for startups to distribute
tokens to users, which forces retail users to farm projects for an
allocation. A new, more thoughtful approach is needed to balance the
interests of regulators, investors, and the community.
