 ELON MUSK DETAILS PERSONAL, SPACEX CRYPTO HOLDINGS (2 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Elon Musk recently confirmed he still holds a substantial amount of
Dogecoin and that his company SpaceX maintains holdings in Bitcoin.
Tesla also owns almost 10,000 Bitcoin, despite selling 4,320 Bitcoin
in 2021 and three-quarters of its remaining Bitcoin in 2022 due to
environmental concerns. In the past, Musk has been accused of market
manipulation in crypto as his comments on Bitcoin and especially
Dogecoin caused massive swings in the market back in 2021. His
commentary on Dogecoin in the more recent past has had a more muted
effect on the coin and his legal team is confident that his comments
have been completely legal.
