 IRS RULES REQUIRE REPORTING DATA FROM $10K CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS IN
2024 (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The US Infrastructure Bill, signed into law by President Biden,
requires crypto transactions above $10,000 to be reported to the IRS.
It officially went into effect at the start of this year. The
legislation requires any entity that receives $10,000 or more in
crypto in the course of business to report personal details of the
parties involved to the IRS within 15 days of the transaction. While
the new law states that not complying will be considered a felony,
there is no guidance on how exactly individuals and businesses should
actually conduct this process.

using this strategy to disrupt non-crypto platforms, provided they
satisfy certain conditions, and provides examples of disruptable
platforms like Chess.com, Stack Overflow, and Tinder.
