MARKETS & BUSINESS

 NASDAQ SEEKS NOD FROM SEC TO TOKENIZE STOCKS (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Nasdaq has filed a proposal with the SEC seeking permission to offer
tokenized stock trading alongside traditional equity trading, allowing
customers to choose between legacy methods and onchain transactions
with equal priority treatment. The tokenized stocks would clear and
settle through the existing Depository Trust Company infrastructure,
with token holders receiving full shareholder rights, including voting
and liquidation privileges. This move follows similar tokenization
efforts by Robinhood in Europe and various crypto exchanges. The
proposal aligns with SEC Chairman Paul Atkins' stated priority of
clearing a path for tokenized securities markets. The regulator
compares the transition to the historical shift from analog to digital
audio formats. 

 SHARPLINK GAMING KICKS OFF $1.5B BUYBACK PROGRAM (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SharpLink Gaming (SBET) has begun executing its $1.5 billion share
repurchase plan, buying back 939,000 shares at an average $15.98. With
837,000 ETH ($3.6B) staked and no debt, the company says repurchases
are “immediately accretive” while shares trade below NAV, boosting
ETH per share for remaining holders. Staking income of $67M–$151M
annually plus cash reserves will also help fund additional buybacks as
SharpLink prioritizes capital allocation over equity issuance.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AERODROME'S COMMUNITY-FIRST TOKEN LAUNCH MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Aerodrome is rethinking token launches by eliminating the usual
pre-sale, market maker payments, and CEX lobbying. Instead, projects
seed liquidity directly on Aerodrome, incentivize emissions via veAERO
votes, and let community liquidity providers and traders handle price
discovery from day one. With Coinbase's new DEX integration, this
model now connects transparent, community-driven launches to millions
of retail users, avoiding the extractive dynamics of traditional
launches. 

 COINBASE ACQUIRES SENSIBLE TEAM TO BOOST ONCHAIN CONSUMER ROADMAP (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Coinbase has acquihired the founders of Sensible, a DeFi-focused
startup, to accelerate its onchain consumer strategy. The new team
will help simplify access to DeFi and expand consumer use cases,
supporting Coinbase's push to become an “everything exchange”
where users can trade, stake, borrow, and spend seamlessly. Coinbase
framed the move as part of its broader mission to make onchain finance
the default for everyday money management.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HYPERLIQUID'S USDH PROPOSAL SAGA (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Multiple stablecoin issuers are competing to partner with Hyperliquid
for its upcoming USDH stablecoin, with GENIUS Act compliance and
revenue sharing as baseline requirements, but the real contest centers
on who can present the most credible vision for growing USDH beyond
margin trading on HyperCore. While established issuers offer
regulatory support and distribution, USDH would likely never be their
top priority, whereas native teams like Native Markets (using Stripe's
Bridge for compliance) could offer maximum ecosystem alignment despite
higher execution risk. The GENIUS Act has effectively commoditized
regulated stablecoins, shifting the competitive advantage from
regulatory compliance to demonstrated long-term commitment and
strategic alignment with the Hyperliquid ecosystem. 

 HOW STABLECOINS PLAY OUT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stablecoins inadvertently support US monetary policy by creating
global dollar demand through cryptocurrency trading, enabling the
government to fund massive deficits through money printing. This
printed capital flows primarily into AI development, which is viewed
as critical for maintaining US economic dominance in competition with
China. Investments should focus on crypto infrastructure ("shovels"),
including stable blockchain networks, exchanges, and major
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, rather than speculative
tokens that primarily serve as liquidity-churning mechanisms.
AI-driven media will amplify this cycle by encouraging more retail
participation in onchain trading, ultimately reinforcing dollar demand
through stablecoin usage.

 MEV WAS A BUG. THEN IT BECAME A BUSINESS. NOW IT'S A TAX (9 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 MEV evolved from an initial design flaw that allowed transaction
ordering to affect blockchain state into a systematized value
extraction mechanism. Over $1.1 billion has been siphoned from
Ethereum users since the Merge through block builders and searchers.
Rather than solving the problem, Layer 2 rollups created new
centralized extraction points through sequencer control, with networks
like Base generating an estimated $50-200 million annually and major
L2s capturing tens of millions from transaction ordering privileges.
The economic incentives have created a permanent "invisible VAT" on
DeFi interactions, where centralized sequencers have no motivation to
decentralize due to the massive revenue streams from controlling
transaction flow. This represents the entrenchment of value extraction
at the infrastructure layer, where owning transaction ordering
mechanisms has become a highly profitable rent-seeking business model
with little accountability or competition. 

 THE GHOST OF FACEBOOK'S LIBRA'S PAST (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Meta's stablecoin project came much closer to regulatory approval
than commonly believed. The Swiss regulator FINMA was ready to approve
Meta's license before political intervention killed the project.
Stripe's Tempo faces the same fundamental flaw that doomed Libra:
corporate chains with centralized control will inevitably break
promises about neutrality and permissionlessness due to economic
incentives to favor their own products over competitors. The core
tension is between crypto's original vision of truly open,
permissionless networks versus the pragmatic appeal of "slick,
branded, proprietary chains" controlled by fintech giants. The success
of corporate blockchain projects like Tempo would represent the
failure of crypto as a revolution, simply replacing traditional
financial monarchies with new centralized empires controlled by tech
companies, potentially splitting along geopolitical lines rather than
creating a unified global infrastructure.
