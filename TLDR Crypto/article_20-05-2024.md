MARKETS & BUSINESS

 ARE NEW COINS STILL GOOD INVESTMENTS? (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 There are many complaints about new coins launching at the highest
possible fully diluted valuation and immediately listing on a tier-1
CEX, providing exit liquidity for VCs. Over 80% of tokens listed on
Binance in the past six months are down, with the only exceptions
being two Solana ecosystem coins and two memecoins. The average FDV of
a Binance listing is $4.2 billion. These projects have no organic
community or positive retail sentiment, causing their tokens to
perform poorly. 

 WHY ARE ALL THESE LOW FLOAT / HIGH FDV COINS DOWN BAD? (15 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 This thread scrutinizes the significant downturn of "low float, high
FDV" cryptocurrencies listed on Binance, debunking prevalent theories
about market manipulation by VCs or shifts in retail investor interest
towards meme coins. None of the popular narratives convincingly
explain the broad price declines. A combination of factors in a
complex market environment, rather than a single culprit, is
responsible for the observed trends. Free markets will eventually
adjust these mispricings on their own.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 THE VALUE OF STATELESSNESS/VERKLE TREES (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ethereum's transition to Verkle trees, a more efficient data
structure, will provide various scalability and node operation
benefits. It will allow for a 10x increase in mainnet gas, simplify
the node architecture, and reduce node sync time to a few seconds.
Consequently, the path for smartphone-based and light nodes will
become possible, helping to improve Ethereum decentralization. 

 PUREDAI: RETURNING TO THE IDEOLOGICAL ROOTS OF DAI (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 PureDai is a proposed stablecoin that aims to deliver cypherpunk
ideals. It prioritizes extreme decentralization and resilience by
leveraging decentralized collateral, maximally decentralized oracles,
and minimal governance. The stablecoin will have a free-floating
target price, permanent emissions to incentivize supply-side growth,
and a governance token. It will interact with Maker SubDAOs,
particularly the Spark lending protocol, to ensure efficient markets.
It is not expected to be released for several years and will likely
change significantly before then.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 COINBASE MONTHLY OUTLOOK: EXPECTATIONS ON ETHEREUM (17 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Ethereum has underperformed in 2024, with many questioning its role
when L2s and competing L1s like Solana take market share. Coinbase
still believes in Ethereum's long-term potential and its advantages
surrounding the developer ecosystem, the proliferation of the EVM,
ETH's utility as DeFi collateral, and its decentralization. ETH is
uniquely positioned as a store-of-value and technology token and could
outperform in the second half of 2024. 

 LIQUIDITY DYNAMICS: UNDERSTANDING UTILIZATION IN LIQUID RESTAKING
TOKENS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The liquid restaking token sector continues to grow, but ETH has been
down since the EIGEN airdrop, leading to speculation that ETH was
overbought or leveraged to farm the token. EtherFi and Renzo are
leaders in the LRT market, with a 73% market share. Still, Renzo's
ezETH has been trading at a 2-3% discount since a depeg event a few
weeks ago, making Puffer's pufETH the second-most liquid LRT behind
eETH. 56% of EigenLayer's TVL is used in a yield generation protocol. 

 LOW FLOAT & HIGH FDV: HOW DID WE GET HERE? (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A report from Binance Research reveals a substantial shift in the
crypto market, with the circulating supply of tokens at launch
decreasing significantly over the past three years, from about 41% to
12.7%. With $155 billion in token supply scheduled to unlock from 2024
to 2030, the study underscores the challenges and potential volatility
facing projects with low float and high fully diluted valuations,
highlighting the need for real utility to support such high initial
valuations.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE NEAR AND MID-TERM FUTURE OF IMPROVING THE ETHEREUM NETWORK'S
PERMISSIONLESSNESS AND DECENTRALIZATION (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vitalik Buterin reflects on Ethereum's progress and the need to
prioritize decentralization and permissionlessness as the network
scales. He mentions concerns about MEV, liquid staking, and node
hardware requirements and suggests potential solutions like inclusion
lists, reduced withdrawal periods for stakers, single-slot finality,
and peer-to-peer networks for storing historical data. While Ethereum
has moved away from its 2021-era ideas about offloading
responsibilities to centralized actors, there is still room for
improvement to make Ethereum a strong base layer for L2s. 

 WHY L2 SCALING IS A LOSING STRATEGY (25 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This thread criticizes the reliance on Layer 2 (L2) solutions for
blockchain scaling, arguing that it leads to worse user experience due
to ecosystem fragmentation, poor economics, and encourages
centralization, which compromises trust and security. It advocates for
scaling at the Layer 1 (L1) level, contending that L2 solutions often
remain centralized, introduce significant security risks including
potential theft by administrators, and ultimately do not solve the
inherent problems but merely shift them onto a weaker model.

 LIDO CO-FOUNDERS, PARADIGM SECRETLY BACK EIGENLAYER COMPETITOR AS
DEFI BATTLE LINES FORM (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Lido's co-founders and Paradigm are secretly backing a new
"restaking" company, Symbiotic, poised to challenge EigenLayer and
potentially reshape the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. 

 POTENTIAL RUNES CATALYSTS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Runes protocol launch experienced a "sell-the-news" reaction, but
the community remains robust and development continues, with potential
catalysts such as listings on major exchanges like Kraken and Binance
poised to rekindle interest. 

 VENEZUELA BANS CRYPTO MINING (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Venezuelan government claims this measure will stabilize the
national power supply, which has suffered frequent blackouts since
2019. 

 UNDERSTANDING THE EIGENLAYER AVS LANDSCAPE (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Eigenlayer enables users to leverage their staked ETH to obtain
additional staking rewards while supporting new Actively Validated
Services (AVS). 

 ROLLUPS SCALE FASTER THAN L1S (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Rollups scale better than fast L1s due to a smaller replication
factor, reducing communication overhead and enabling faster
performance.
