MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FEDERAL RESERVE REMOVES 'REPUTATIONAL RISK' FROM BANK EXAMINATIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Federal Reserve has eliminated ‚Äúreputational risk‚Äù as a
factor in bank exams, aligning with the OCC and FDIC in removing a key
regulatory barrier that critics say fueled discriminatory debanking of
crypto firms. The change may allow banks to reengage with digital
asset companies without fear of regulatory backlash. The move marks a
notable shift in U.S. banking supervision amid political scrutiny of
Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and growing pressure to clarify crypto
access. 

 CRYPTO MARKETS HOLD AT 'INFLECTION POINT' AFTER BITCOIN'S DIP ON
MIDDLE EAST FRICTION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bitcoin rebounded above $102K after briefly falling below $99K on
Middle East tensions. Analysts see markets at an ‚Äúinflection
point,‚Äù balancing geopolitical risk and macro uncertainty against
growing institutional adoption, including Texas' Bitcoin reserve and
new corporate treasury buys. While short-term positioning remains
cautious, long-term demand signals resilience, with analysts eyeing
July Fed updates and geopolitical developments as key directional
catalysts.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR TOKEN MARKET TRANSPARENCY (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blockworks launched the Token Transparency Framework, an 18-criterion
disclosure standard covering token supply and vesting, insider
incentives, market-making and exchange agreements, entity structures,
and financials to close critical information gaps in the crypto
market. Initial adopters ‚Äì Jito, Aerodrome, Raydium, Stride,
Jupiter, and Morpho ‚Äì achieved transparency scores above 35 versus a
control group scoring 8‚Äì13. The open-source framework aggregates
materiality-weighted scores across four categories and is intended to
streamline due diligence for investors, market makers, and exchanges
while complementing SEC initiatives like Safe Harbor 2.0. 

 CREATOR COINS ARE NOW ON ZORA (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 After the success of individual content coins, Zora has introduced
creator coins to represent profiles in a succinct manner. Each profile
has a coin, and creators earn on trades of their coins. Creator coins
capture the value of all posts, as content coins are paired with
creator coins.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 DEFI'S LAST MISSING PIECE (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Onchain DeFi continues to trail CEXes not for lack of innovation but
due to painful fiat onramps that carry 3‚Äì10% fees, >50% failure
rates, and slow settlements, causing over 90% user drop-off at the
first step. CEXes treat fiat deposits as loss leaders to deliver
virtually free, instant, and reliable onramps. The proposed solution
is for revenue-generating DeFi protocols to allocate a portion of
their revenues to subsidize onramp providers in real time, thereby
matching CEX-style UX. Such onramp subsidies could unlock mainstream
user growth and close the gap between CEX and DeFi adoption. 

 DEFI DERIVATIVES: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW (60 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DeFi derivatives platforms have seen a 100x surge in TVL since dYdX's
2020 launch and GMX's 2021 debut. This guide unpacks perpetuals
fundamentals like leveraged exposure, funding‚Äêrate mechanics, and
delta‚Äêneutral strategies, contrasts decentralized orderbook (DCLOB)
vs ‚Äúhouse‚Äù AMM ((X)LP) models, and explains margin requirements,
liquidation engines, and oracle-driven price discovery. It also
explores liquidity bootstrapping hurdles, the ‚Äúmiddling trap‚Äù of
migrating from in-protocol pools to market‚Äêmaker orderbooks, and the
varied clearing, execution, and cross-margin designs across platforms.

 DAOS VS FINTECH: A COST EFFICIENCY GAP EMERGES (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A new chart highlights the stark contrast in annual operating
expenses between major fintechs and DAOs. Coinbase, Robinhood, and
Revolut each spend $1.9B-$3.3B annually, while DAOs like Circle and
Aave operate on drastically leaner budgets ($491M and $64M
respectively). This supports the thesis that blockchain-native
protocols achieve global scale with far lower overhead, offering
stronger developer leverage than traditional fintech counterparts. 

 KALSHI'S SILENCE ON GEOPOLITICS COULD COST THEM LONG-TERM (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Polymarket's real-time coverage of the Middle East conflict is
earning it widespread media citations, while Kalshi's lack of markets
during a global flashpoint is a critical miss. In the attention
economy of modern prediction markets, usefulness builds brand trust,
which compounds through both media references and trader liquidity.
Kalshi's strict regulatory compliance may preserve licenses, but as
Polymarket becomes the default source of truth, it risks irrelevance.
