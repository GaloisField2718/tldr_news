 GENIUS ACT PASSES SENATE CLOTURE VOTE (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Senate passed a procedural cloture vote on the GENIUS Act with
over 60 votes, just two weeks after the same measure failed, after key
Democrats switched to support. A newly negotiated draft added ethics
provisions barring senior officials and contingently Big Tech firms
from issuing stablecoins, plus enhanced national‑security and
data‑privacy protections to secure bipartisan backing. Intense
industry lobbying, including Coinbase's Stand With Crypto and appeals
by Treasury Secretary Bessent, helped revive momentum after initial
setbacks. The bill now moves to a full Senate floor vote, then to the
House, before heading to President Trump to create a clear federal
framework for legally issuing stablecoins in the United States. 

 BANCOR SUES UNISWAP FOR PATENT INFRINGEMENT OVER DEX SMART CONTRACT
TECH (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bancor's Bprotocol Foundation and LocalCoin Ltd. have filed a lawsuit
against Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Foundation, alleging unauthorized
use of Bancor's patented constant product AMM (CPAMM) technology first
introduced in 2016. The suit claims Uniswap's original 2018 protocol
infringes on Bancor's 2017 patents covering the automated,
permissionless onchain swap mechanism foundational to DEXs.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GRID: OPEN FINANCE FOR STABLECOIN RAILS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Squads has launched Grid, a suite of developer-friendly APIs designed
to replace legacy banking middleware with stablecoin-native
infrastructure on Solana. Grid enables fintech teams to spin up global
USD accounts, send cross-border payments, integrate yield, trade
tokenized assets, and issue virtual cards, all without touching
complex blockchain tooling or sponsor banks. 

 ALPENGLOW: A NEW CONSENSUS FOR SOLANA (60 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Solana's Alpenglow consensus mechanism replaces TowerBFT and
Proof-of-History with Votor for concurrent one- and two-round voting
finality and Rotor for erasure-coded, single-hop data dissemination,
foregoing gossip. Simulations based on current stake distribution show
median finality latency of ~150 ms (as fast as 100 ms), down from
~12.8 s under the legacy protocol. Alpenglow's “20+20” resilience
tolerates 20% adversarial and 20% non-responsive stake, while Rotor
maximally leverages network bandwidth to minimize leader bottlenecks.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MEV EXPLAINED (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is the profit block producers and
searchers capture by strategically ordering, including, or excluding
transactions beyond standard rewards, arising from information
asymmetries in public mempools. Common forms include frontrunning
lottery claims, backrunning AMM arbitrage, sandwich attacks on trades,
and speculative transaction retries at low fees. Unchecked MEV can
drive up gas costs through spam, incentivize consensus-layer forks,
and centralize power among proficient extractors. Mitigation
approaches range from offchain and order-flow auctions and single-slot
finality to application-specific designs, fair-ordering protocols, and
encrypted mempools, helping align incentives and reduce harmful
externalities. 

 MAKING SENSE OF STABLECOIN RATINGS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stablecoins employ diverse collateral and algorithmic mechanisms,
creating distinct risk profiles that frameworks like Bluechip's
SMIDGE, which assesses stability, management, implementation,
decentralization, governance, and externals, help illuminate.
Traditional agencies such as S&P and Moody's are now applying
securities-style analyses, reflecting growing institutional scrutiny
of stablecoin infrastructure. Tether's low rating for transparency yet
dominant liquidity and PYUSD's strong reserve backing offset by high
centralization exemplify these trade-offs. Users must therefore align
stablecoin choices and ratings with their own priorities,
understanding that no single rating captures every dimension of risk.

 BEST WALLET CONNECTION IS NO WALLET CONNECTION (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ERC-7946 proposes a new model where dApps suggest transactions via QR
code or NFC without accessing the user's wallet address, significantly
improving privacy. Instead of connecting wallets directly (an
increasingly risky and exclusionary practice), this standard treats
dApps as composable interfaces for crafting transactions, not identity
checkpoints. If adopted, it would prevent dApps from blocking users
based on wallet history (e.g. Tornado Cash usage) and reduce
third-party data leaks, enabling a new class of privacy-first, even
offline, Ethereum applications. 

 COINBASE POWERING WEBULL'S CRYPTO EXPERIENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coinbase's Crypto-as-a-Service will power Webull Pay's crypto
services – trading, custody, staking, and USDC – starting June.

and compliance. Webull Pay customers will access Coinbase's advanced
infrastructure and income-earning crypto features, positioning the
platform for scalable growth. Webull Pay is also exploring global
expansion to offer branded crypto experiences across markets.
