 Pantera's monthly newsletter covered many topics, including comparing
Solana to macOS for its use of vertical integration, which enables

The value of a mint plus airdrops peaked at $800,000 in May 2022
before spiraling downward as parent company Yuga acquired dozens of
other projects and failed to pivot into a gaming company, which saw
apes fall to an 8 ETH floor.
