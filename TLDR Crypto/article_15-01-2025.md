GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHY THE COMMUNITY IS NOT THE PRODUCT (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The author, a veteran crypto builder, shares insights from failed
experiments within tokenized communities, arguing that extrinsic
incentives ultimately destroy authentic community dynamics by crowding
out intrinsic motivation. The author concludes that tokens and
communities should exist at opposite ends of an ecosystem, with tokens
serving as powerful tools for incentivizing contributions to
decentralized organizations but not for “rewarding communities.”
Token incentives face specific challenges like the impossibility of
maintaining non-predictable, non-exclusive, and culturally neutral
rewards. The better approach is to defend against incentive seekers
rather than scaling through token-based growth mechanisms.

developer networks and interdependent growth, while Hyperliquid's
product-first approach prioritizes building a standout trading
platform to organically attract users and liquidity. The winner of
this philosophical divide could redefine success metrics for
blockchain innovation.
