 WHY Q1 INVESTMENTS WERE SO HOT AND HOW IT COMPARES TO PREVIOUS BULL
MARKETS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The crypto venture capital landscape saw a significant uptick in Q1
2024, with $2.52 billion raised across the sector. Competitiveness
among VCs has created a founder-friendly environment, leading to
higher valuations and more favorable terms for startups. While the
market is expected to remain bullish throughout 2024, regulatory
uncertainty and the absence of large deployers of capital from the
previous bull market may prevent funding levels from reaching the
heights seen in 2021 and 2022. 

 ANALYSIS OF RECENT EVENTS IN SEC V. COINBASE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Head of Legal at the Blockchain Association, Marisa Coppel, shares
her insight into recent Coinbase case developments for the industry.
With the SEC‚Äôs claim that the Coinbase Wallet is an unregistered
broker being dismissed, developers can rest assured that peer-to-peer
technology does not fall under the oversight of the SEC. Though the
rest of the case still stands, this is not unexpected, as the court
must take all claims by the SEC as fact until the upcoming discovery
period.

 OVERVIEW OF MODULAR VS MONOLITHIC BLOCKCHAINS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Monolithic blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum integrate all
functions ‚Äî execution, data availability, consensus, and settlement
‚Äî within a single chain, which offers simplicity and security but
struggles with scalability and flexibility. On the other hand, modular
blockchains distribute these functions across multiple layers or
components, allowing for a customizable and scalable system. This
architectural evolution aims to balance security, scalability, and
decentralization, offering solutions like Celestia for data
availability and the Fuel Network for independent modular protocols,
despite the complexity and potential interoperability issues that come
with modular designs. 

 WHAT ELSE COULD MEMECOINS BE? (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin provides his take on the current
state of the memecoin market, opining how memecoins can be
positive-sum and more than a tool for speculation. He argues for
integrating memecoins with a specific initiative or charity but notes
potential limitations with a simple partnership. His main point
centers on memecoins tied to fun, engaging games that leave
lower-income players better off while still being enjoyable for those
playing without monetary incentives ‚Äì ‚ÄúWorld of Warcraft on the
blockchain.‚Äù Buterin concludes by expressing disdain for the racist
or derogatory memecoins but hopes that the positive ones could have a
significant societal impact.

 AN ARGUMENT AGAINST BITTENSOR‚ÄôS $TAO (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Taproot Wizard‚Äôs Eric Wall explained why he believes the $10

frustration at the redundancy of the model computations and how they
are incentivized to give extremely similar results or otherwise not be
rewarded tokens. Wall also noted that the models have similar content
filters to ChatGPT and thus offer no benefits over centralized
solutions.

[11]

policies for crypto assets with the goal of treating them fairly vs

it describes giving crypto assets capital gains treatment, but
exceptions under $5,000 to avoid forcing taxpayers to track tiny
capital gains for gas spent on transactions.
