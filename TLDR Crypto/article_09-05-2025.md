MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE BUYS OPTIONS EXCHANGE DERIBIT FOR $2.9B (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Coinbase is acquiring crypto options exchange Deribit for $2.9
billion to establish a stronger U.S. presence in the rapidly expanding
crypto derivatives market. The acquisition followed a bidding contest
with Kraken, which instead purchased the futures platform NinjaTrader
for $1.5 billion. Deribit processed $1.2 trillion in trading volume in
2024, marking a 95% year-over-year increase and solidifying its
position as a leader in digital asset options trading. 

 OCC REAFFIRMS BANKS' AUTHORITY TO CUSTODY CRYPTO ASSETS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reaffirmed
that federally chartered banks are permitted to offer crypto custody
services, provided they meet regulatory expectations. In a letter to
Senator Elizabeth Warren, the OCC emphasized that crypto custody
remains legally permissible under prior guidance, subject to robust
risk management and compliance protocols.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BRIDGE INTRODUCING USDB STABLECOIN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bridge has launched USDB, a 1:1 cash- and money market-backed
stablecoin held at BlackRock. It is designed to share treasury yield
with developers and users, rather than be retained solely for the
issuer. The platform supports instant, fee-free conversions between
USDB and other stablecoins, while offering customizable, white-labeled
stablecoin infrastructure with on-chain and off-chain security
features such as token freezing and account whitelisting. 

 DEFI PIONEER'S SUPERSTATE TO BRING PUBLIC EQUITIES TO SOLANA (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Superstate, led by DeFi veteran Robert Leshner, is launching Opening
Bell, a platform that will allow companies to issue and trade
SEC-registered public equities directly on the Solana blockchain. The
move, starting with Canadian firm SOL Strategies, signals a major push
toward regulated, blockchain-native capital markets accessible to both
institutional and retail investors.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHY IS ZORA SO INTERESTING? (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Zora is positioning itself as a mainstream social platform built on
crypto infrastructure designed to tokenize content and equitably
distribute value across creators, curators, consumers, and
speculators, unlike traditional platforms that capture the majority of
revenue. Its flywheel model relies on content creation, amplification,
engagement, and speculation, with on-chain tokens rewarding each role.
To scale, Zora must streamline the user experience by abstracting
financial mechanics, personalizing onboarding with curated moodboards,
and meeting conventional UX standards. A dedicated “Pro Mode” is
also essential to attract and retain speculators in the competitive
attention economy. 

 HODL IS DEAD, DAOS ARE LMAOS, BYE DEFI (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The "HODL" era has ended for all but Bitcoin, which remains the only
crypto asset with macro-level status. Market dynamics now favor fast,
tactical trading. Venture capital has shifted from early-stage
enthusiasm to extraction, yet Q1 2025 still saw $4.8 billion in
inflows, particularly into real-world asset (RWA) protocols and
blockchain infrastructure. DeFi's decentralization ideal has mostly
given way to institutional “on-chain finance” using vault
strategies and tokenized RWAs, while DAOs are increasingly
centralized, prompting critiques of them becoming oligarchic or
ineffective.

 META IN TALKS TO DEPLOY STABLECOINS (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Meta is revisiting stablecoins three years after shelving its Diem
project. The company is holding early-stage discussions with crypto
firms and has hired fintech veteran Ginger Baker to explore using
USD-pegged stablecoins for cross-border and creator payments. Industry
momentum is growing, with Visa partnering with Bridge, Fidelity
building a proprietary stablecoin, and Stripe launching
stablecoin-backed accounts. Meta's renewed interest comes as
enterprise adoption accelerates and U.S. lawmakers move closer to
stablecoin legislation. 

 PRIVY PAY: BRINGING TAP-TO-PAY UX TO ONCHAIN TRANSACTIONS (5 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Privy has launched "Privy Pay," a crypto-native tap-to-pay system
designed to replicate the ease of Apple and Google Pay. Built for
FarCon attendees, it combines a Raspberry Pi terminal with NFC
hardware and a Farcaster mini app, allowing users to make on-chain
purchases by tapping their phones. The initiative is a major step
toward mainstream, in-person crypto payments.
