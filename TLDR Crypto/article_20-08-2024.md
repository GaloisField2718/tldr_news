 KAMALA HARRIS RUMORED TO WANT SEC CHAIR GARY GENSLER FOR TREASURY
SECRETARY (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 According to Senate staffer rumors, Kamala Harris is considering
making anti-crypto SEC Chair Gary Gensler the Treasury Secretary under
her administration. Republican Senate staffers and politicians are
against this nomination, and Democrats are split around crypto
support. There has been no official statement from the Harris
campaign. 

 SEC TALKS WITH ETF ISSUERS OVER CONCERNS OF SOLANA BEING A SECURITY
PRECEDED CBOE REMOVING 19B-4S (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The SEC spoke with potential Solana ETF applicants about Solana
possibly being a security. As a result, the Cboe agreed not to file
19b-4 forms, which would have started the official approval decision
process. There might be new amendments to filings that would argue for
Solana's status as a commodity. Experts believe Solana ETFs stand
little chance of being approved under the Biden Administration and
Gensler's SEC.

 BASE DASHBOARDS & DATA SOURCES (1 MINUTE READ) [8]

metrics like blockspace usage, stablecoin overviews, gas prices, user

on-chain global economy that is decentralized and inclusive. 

 TOP LIQUID RESTAKING PROTOCOLS FOR REWARDS AND AIRDROPS (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 With the restaking narrative growing, protocols like EtherFi and
Renzo continue with points programs to reward stakers with tokens.
Swell, Eigenpie, Puffer, and Kelp have yet to release a token, though
Swell targets an October launch. Mellow Protocol, the liquid restaking
protocol for Symbiotic, has grown to over $650M in TVL and 40% of
Symbiotic's TVL. Bedrock is offering liquid restaking for Babylon with
WBTC.

 WHY ETHENA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOSERS IN THE RECENT MARKET
CORRECTION (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethena, the platform behind USDe, has seen a $500 million decrease in
USDe supply because of negative funding rates cutting into its yields.
These poor conditions, coupled with the ineffectiveness of recent
measures like adding Solana as a backing asset to reinvigorate the
protocol, have severely impacted Ethena's growth and the value of its
governance token, ENA. 

 WHY ULTRASOUND MONEY IS DEAD WITHOUT MAINNET USERS (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 L2s can play games by posting data to the mainnet, using blobs when
it is cheap and slowing their posting frequency when it is expensive.
During a previous period of high fees, Scroll stopped posting
altogether while Taiko slowed its page. Mainnet power users and
builders are critical to supporting ETH as a utility token, though L2s
using it as their primary form of currency improves its monetary
premium.
