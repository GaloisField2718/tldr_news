 WHY MONETIZE PROTOCOLS? (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post makes an argument for monetizing protocols and why builders
should consider this versus free-to-use protocols. The benefits of
monetization include improved governance, as it allows a broader
community to influence the protocol's future, while also preventing
any one party from seizing control. Monetization can also help manage
harmful players or applications by incentivizing compliance and
deterring non-adherence.

lower middle income countries, crypto is showing real promise as a
killer use case to break through these borders.
