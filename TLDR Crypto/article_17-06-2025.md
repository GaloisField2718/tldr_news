MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TRON LOOKS TO GO PUBLIC IN THE U.S. (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tron is set to go public via a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM
Entertainment, creating ‚ÄúTron Inc.‚Äù and seeding it with $210
million of TRX tokens in a treasury model akin to Michael Saylor's
Bitcoin holding firm. The deal lifted TRX by nearly 4% and sent SRM
shares up about 250% in pre-market trading. Justin Sun, a Trump ally,
aims to leverage this listing to capitalize on recent crypto IPO
momentum despite Eric Trump publicly denying any formal role. 

 TRUMP'S TRUTH SOCIAL FILES FOR DUAL BITCOIN AND ETHER ETF (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Trump Media and Technology Group filed an S-1 with the SEC to launch
a spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF, allocating 75% to Bitcoin and 25% to
Ether, with Crypto.com appointed as custodian and liquidity provider.
It follows the company's recent standalone registration for a Bitcoin
ETF and mirrors the Trump family's Ethereum-focused holdings at World
Liberty Financial. If approved, the fund would join a roster of major
crypto ETFs, with Bitcoin alone having amassed over $131 billion in
assets under management.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ZKPDF: MAKING PDFS VERIFIABLE WITH ZERO-KNOWLEDGE (20 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 zkPDF is a zero-knowledge toolkit that cryptographically verifies
digitally signed PDFs and proves specific facts like a name or balance
without revealing the rest of the document. It overcomes PDF
complexity by using the SP1 ZKVM for native Rust circuits, a custom
lightweight parser for page-by-page text extraction, and optimized
signature verification via precompiles. Proofs take under a minute on
typical PDFs and require minimal dependencies, making zkPDF
immediately applicable to ecosystems like India's DigiLocker, contract
platforms (DocuSign), and banking documents. 

 INTRODUCING MARBLE (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Marble is a managed cloud platform from the Ponder team that
streamlines the hardest part of crypto backends ‚Äì offchain indexing
‚Äì by offering zero-downtime deployments, built-in RPC connections,
automatic observability, and collaboration tools. Built on the
open-source Ponder engine used by Morpho, ENS, and Optimism, Marble
lets developers go from local prototype to production in a few clicks
without wrestling with re-orgs, backfills, or infrastructure sizing.
While indexing is the first focus, Marble's
primitives-not-opinionated-solutions approach will soon extend to
other offchain workloads.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HODL ON TIGHT: PUBLIC COMPANIES PUTTING CRYPTO ON THE BALANCE SHEET:
¬†AN EXCLUSIVE, TIMELY WEBINAR (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Clear Street, Nakamoto, Sol Strategies, Upexi, and ICR invite you to
explore why public companies are adding Bitcoin and other digital
assets to their balance sheets. Most must apply to attend‚Äîbut TLDR
Crypto readers can skip the waitlist with this exclusive link [12].
Space is limited‚Äîdon't miss out. 

 NEW PAYMENT STACK CIRCUMVENTING CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The new payment stack streamlines crypto payments by removing
intermediaries like CEXs and aggregators. Users onboard with Privy
(embedded wallets), complete one-time KYC, and use Bridge for seamless
in-app on/off-ramps, while Stripe supplies banking rails, licenses,
and merchant access. Compared to the traditional fragmented stack,
this model collapses complexity and may become the dominant UX layer
for crypto payments at scale. 

 THE STATE OF NEW CHAINS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Several high-profile chains launched in early 2025, but only Unichain
and WorldChain show strong signs of sustainable traction. This has
largely been driven by DeFi integration and identity-linked network
effects, whereas others like Berachain and Ink have struggled
post-airdrop due to sharp usage drop-offs. The market is maturing
fast: token hype is fading, and only chains solving real user problems
or embedding into core crypto infra are surviving.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CELESTIA DOWN BECAUSE OF UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS (2 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Markets price tokens not just on utility or promise, but on the gap
between story and execution. Celestia, while building real
infrastructure, launched with high narrative expectations that are
outpacing visible traction, creating ‚Äúnarrative bleed.‚Äù In
contrast, Hyperliquid's underpromise-overdeliver approach has kept its
narrative aligned with progress. Token launches effectively borrow
against future execution and if that debt compounds unaddressed, the
market punishes the lag. 

 TRADFI'S LIQUIDITY ISSUE IS CRYPTO'S SILENT RISK (13 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Crypto markets suffer a hidden fragility: liquidity that appears deep
in calm conditions vanishes under stress, much like ETFs and passive
funds in TradFi post-2008. Fragmented order books across dozens of
exchanges and phantom volumes from spoofing and wash trades mean
tokens plunge with severe slippage when sentiment shifts. Embedding
cross-chain bridging and smart liquidity routing into base protocol
designs could unify pools, reduce fragmentation, and ensure capital
flows smoothly. With execution speeds now near 10 ms and automated
stablecoin trading dominant, the infrastructure exists, but what's
needed is plumbing that treats asset movement as a foundational
feature, not an afterthought.
