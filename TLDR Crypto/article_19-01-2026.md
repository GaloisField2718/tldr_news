MARKETS & BUSINESS

 STABLECOIN YIELD SPAT PUTS CLARITY ACT AT RISK (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The White House is reportedly weighing whether to abandon the CLARITY
Act after Coinbase pulled support ahead of a Senate Banking markup.
The dispute centers on restrictions against paying yield for simply
holding stablecoins, a key issue for Coinbase, given estimates that
stablecoin-related revenue could exceed $1B in 2025. 

 BITCOIN DROPS BELOW $92.5K AS TARIFF-WAR HEADLINES TRIGGER CRYPTO
SELLOFF (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin slid about 3% in a few hours to roughly $92,474, dragging
ETH, XRP, and SOL lower and triggering over $750M in long liquidations
as markets reacted to escalating US-EU tariff-war fears tied to a
Greenland dispute. Analysts said the geopolitical shock hit a market
already on edge from the stalled US crypto market structure bill and
weakening crypto-specific risk appetite. Technical breaks and ETF
outflows provided additional pressure.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ONCHAIN AI 2.0? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Open source AI founders are tapping into crypto for bootstrapping via
BagsApp creator fees and launching memecoins that create a direct
economic feedback loop where speculation generates royalties for
development. Flagship example Ralph Wiggum (a Claude Code plugin) has
gained adoption from Vercel, Cursor, and Claude founders, with the
developer endorsing $RALPH on Solana. This trend hints at the
potential for appcoins to trend as more end-users become developers
thanks to AI coding. 

 PROTOCOL SIMPLICITY IS THE FOUNDATION OF TRUSTLESSNESS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 True trustlessness, self-sovereignty, and the “walkaway test”
depend less on decentralization metrics and more on protocol
simplicity. Excessive complexity forces users to trust experts,
weakens long-term resilience, and increases security risk. Ethereum
should adopt explicit “simplification” and “garbage
collection” mechanisms to reduce code size, minimize cryptographic
dependencies, strengthen invariants, and demote complex legacy
features to smart contracts so Ethereum can evolve into a durable,
century-scale decentralized system.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE HIDDEN DANGERS & COSTS OF TOKENIZED ASSETS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most tokenized assets trade in illiquid, fragile markets, creating a
self-reinforcing cycle where shallow liquidity discourages
participation. The first hidden cost appears in slippage, with
tokenized gold showing striking differences versus traditional
markets. Despite the promise to bring trillion-dollar TradFi markets
onchain, liquidity as a prerequisite for composability has not been
realized. 

 IS CRYPTO HIRING COOKED IN 2026? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto job postings plummeted 80% YoY in early January, dropping from
~38 jobs/day to ~6.5 jobs/day across major boards. Hiring is
concentrated in infrastructure, stablecoins, and payment rails (60%),
with growth-stage companies leading demand for senior talent. Solana
captured 22% of new developers in 2024 vs Ethereum's 16%. It is the
first ecosystem since 2016 to challenge ETH's talent dominance.

 SUNSETTING YAPS & INTRODUCING KAITO STUDIO (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Kaito is shutting down Yaps, its permissionless incentivized
engagement platform, and launching Kaito Studio as the company pivots
away from high-volume airdrop distribution models. Despite experiments
with tighter eligibility filters, social and onchain verification, and
varied incentive designs, Yaps struggled with persistent spam and
quality issues exacerbated by X algorithm changes and the
proliferation of low-threshold InfoFi competitors. The decision
reflects broader industry trends toward targeted user acquisition
rather than global, volume-based reward programs. 

 INTRODUCING $GWEI: THE GOVERNANCE TOKEN FOR ETHGAS (5 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 $GWEI is the governance token for ETHGas' "Realtime Ethereum"
infrastructure. It transforms Ethereum blockspace into a structured,
tradable asset enabling instant execution, budgetable costs, and
gasless user experiences through blockspace commitments,
pre-confirmations, and real-time settlement. The token operates on a
vote-escrow model where staking $GWEI for periods ranging from one
week to four years grants $veGWEI voting power proportional to lock
duration, allowing holders to govern protocol parameters, treasury
allocation, smart contract upgrades, and emergency actions with voting
influence deliberately weighted toward long-term participants over
short-term speculators. ETHGas aims to solve Ethereum's blockspace
allocation inefficiencies that haven't evolved alongside application
development.
