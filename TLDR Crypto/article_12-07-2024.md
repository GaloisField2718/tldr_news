 GOLDMAN SACHS TO ROLL OUT TRIO OF TOKENIZATION PROJECTS BY END OF
YEAR (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Goldman Sachs' global head of digital assets, Mathew Mcdermott, says
the bank plans to launch three tokenization projects before the end of
2024. These projects will create marketplaces for tokenized assets,
increase transaction speeds, and diversify collateral options. Goldman
views tokenization as a critical area of opportunity and
differentiates itself from BlackRock and Franklin Templeton by
focusing on institutions.

 L2 ASSET INTEROPERABILITY VIA TWO-WAY CANONICAL BRIDGES (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 L2-native assets, worth a combined $12 billion, cannot be bridged to
other L2s. Two-way canonical bridges allow these tokens to be bridged
to any L2 by first reverse-canonically bridging to the L1. Though
shared sequencers and AggLayer solve this problem, they do not do so
across all L2 ecosystems, making bridging the ideal solution. 

 COINBASE LAUNCHING A 'ONE-STOP' CRYPTO APP DESIGNED TO SIMPLIFY USER

users to manage their entire crypto portfolio (tokens, NFTs, and DeFi
positions), with the goal of simplifying the user experience and
bringing its entire user base of ~100M "on chain." The app will allow
users to connect multiple wallets and perform a range of on-chain
activities.

 4 LESSONS IN CONSUMER CRYPTO (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Any consumer crypto app is years away from adoption, so focus on the
long-term viability of the product. Create a blend of purist and
tourist, as too much of either is off-putting to specific user bases.
Adhere deeply to the market culture and do research with real builders
and users in the space. Ignore tribalism and emphasize the utility of
your app above all else.

 THREE IMPORTANT ARBITRUMDAO PROPOSALS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ArbitrumDAO faces crucial decisions with proposals for ARB staking, a
new transaction ordering policy, and increasing the base gas fee.
While staking could align incentives and boost voter participation, it
might be less effective due to reduced surplus fees. The new ordering
policy needs careful consideration regarding ETH collection versus ARB
burning. Raising the gas fee could impact network competitiveness and
user activity.
