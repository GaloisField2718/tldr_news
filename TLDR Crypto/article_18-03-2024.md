 SOLANA'S MEMECOIN MANIA PUSHES ON-CHAIN VOLUMES AND FEES TO NEW HIGHS
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The memecoin frenzy that has been brewing on Solana has boosted
on-chain volumes to new records, exceeding $3.79 billion in volume per
day. The success of coins like dogwifhat and the Book of Meme presale
helped drive these volumes to new heights. This trend has helped
Solana pass Ethereum in on-chain DEX volumes and has pushed the price
of Solana to over $200.

 IT‚ÄôS RAINING RUNESTONES AS BITCOIN ORDINALS PROJECT LAUNCHES
AIRDROP (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new Ordinals collection called Runestones was airdropped to early
ecosystem participants last week. Runestones will transform into Runes
tokens with the launch of the new UTXO-based Runes protocol, pioneered

 STURDY SUBNET: A BITTENSOR SUBNETWORK (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sturdy Finance has launched the Sturdy Subnet Bittensor subnetwork on
testnet as part of its efforts to build yield optimization
infrastructure. Sturdy, backed by Pantera and Y Combinator, utilizes a
groundbreaking architecture that experts claim could cut risk while

yields in a secure, decentralized manner.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ON DUNAS AND BORGS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread lays out two new crypto law concepts that were recently
introduced - DUNAs (Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit
Associations) and BORGs (Cybernetic Organizations). DUNAs are intended
to grant legal personhood to DAOs, allowing them to contract, sue, and
pay taxes under US tax law. BORGs are legally wrapped multisigs that
limit liability while setting parameters for their activities. Experts
suggest these concepts, while not universal solutions, add to the
growing toolkit for managing DAOs within a legal framework. 

 EIGENLAYER: MY VALUE ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC SECURITY (15 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 EigenLayer, a security abstraction and application layer, offers
Ethereum validators the ability to earn additional revenue by lending
out staked capital for various uses. By utilizing staked capital
that's already serving as security collateral, modules established on
EigenLayer can leverage the existing Ethereum validator pool and
introduce additional slashing conditions. This process, known as
"restaking," has the potential to reduce the financial strain
associated with security for users of decentralized applications,
lowering the bar for innovation and reshaping the landscape of
protocol financing.

 IN DEFENSE OF MEMECOINS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Memecoins, from Dogecoin to lesser-known tokens, play a vital role in
pushing the boundaries of financial freedom and societal commitment to
digital property rights. Memecoins are both a cultural and a financial
phenomenon that represent a form of collective expression gained
through emerging technologies. 

 ON POLICYMAKERS‚Äô PERSPECTIVES ON BITCOIN (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Policymakers' opposition to Bitcoin, especially Bitcoin ETFs, is more
rooted in concerns about the financial system's stability than
investor protection or criminal use. Bitcoin acts as a stark signaling
device, highlighting problems with excessive government spending and
monetary policy. The ETFs also provide an easy ‚Äòexit ramp‚Äô for all
people, which could prove to be problematic for a regime reliant on
excessive government spending.
