MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN TRADES AT $105,500, LONG-TERM OUTLOOK REMAINS OPTIMISTIC (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bitcoin is trading at around $105.5k after pulling back from its
$111.8k all-time high. Analysts are calling this a key pivot zone that
could determine the next leg of the market cycle. BTC Markets' Rachael
Lucas says a push above $105K could target $115K, while a drop below
$103K risks a pullback to the $93K–$97K range—without breaking the
broader uptrend. Institutional flows continue to dominate, sidelining
altcoins and positioning Bitcoin as a strategic macro hedge in
corporate treasuries. 

 CIRCLE RAISES IPO TARGET TO $896M AMID STRONG INVESTOR INTEREST (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Circle increased its IPO offering to 32 million shares at a
$27–$28 price range, raising its target proceeds to $896 million,
up from 24 million shares at $24–$26. The boost follows hints of a
$6.7 billion valuation, up from $5 billion, and interest from major
institutions like BlackRock, which may take a 10% stake. This surge in
appetite coincides with growing stablecoin adoption, with
$94.2 billion settled between January 2023 and February 2025,
and a more favorable U.S. regulatory landscape under the Trump
administration, including progress on the CLARITY Act and evolving SEC
and CFTC guidance.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AAVE STAKING AND RISK SYSTEM OVERHAUL (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Aave governance has passed the Umbrella activation, launching a new
staking and slashing system to replace the legacy Safety Module. The
upgrade introduces high-yield aToken staking (up to 12% on stables),
phases out StkGHO, cuts AAVE emissions, and automates bad debt
resolution making Aave more capital-efficient, lower-cost, and better
protected. The new vault architecture will roll out in three days. 

 ORBITAL, AN AMM FOR POOLS OF 2, 3, OR 10,000 STABLECOINS (40 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Orbital generalizes concentrated liquidity to pools of three or more
stablecoins by organizing “ticks” as nested spherical caps around
the $1 equal-price point, enabling LPs to allocate capital where
stablecoins trade most tightly. Each tick's reserves lie on an
n-dimensional sphere intersected by a hyperplane (the tick boundary),
and interior ticks behave like full spheres while boundary ticks
reduce to (n−1)-dimensional spheres. By decomposing total reserves
into components parallel and orthogonal to the equal-price vector,
Orbital derives a toroidal invariant that lets it compute trades and
handle tick boundary crossings in constant time regardless of the
pool's dimension. This design delivers significant capital efficiency,
allowing a 5-coin pool with a 1% depeg tolerance to see ~150×
efficiency while allowing LPs to customize exposure across multiple
depeg scenarios.

 THE END OF THE FOUNDATION ERA IN CRYPTO (48 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto foundations, once useful for navigating early regulatory
hostility, now impose misaligned incentives, legal constraints, and
centralizing inefficiencies. With emerging “control‐based”
regulatory frameworks, developer companies can more effectively deploy
capital, attract talent, and align with tokenholders via tools like
revenue sharing, milestone vesting, and contractual safeguards.
Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations (DUNAs) and
on‐chain governance tooling (BORGs) offer lightweight, transparent
alternatives to foundation structures by enabling DAOs to contract and
enforce obligations without opaque intermediaries. As a result,
companies and DAOs can achieve true decentralization, accountability,
and scale without relying on slow nonprofit foundations. 

 THE DEATH OF INFOFI (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 InfoFi platforms like Kaito profit massively by charging projects
high listing fees and taking cuts from token taxes, effectively
selling user attention to bidders. While companies gain temporary
mindshare, they suffer from inauthentic engagement, AI-generated
low‑quality content, poor conversion, and post‑campaign token
sell‑offs that harm credibility. This model generates fatigue and
burnout among both creators and genuine projects that can't afford or
don't want to participate. InfoFi platforms should iterate and improve
their algorithms, rewards, and conversion mechanisms to foster more
authentic, sustainable engagement.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STABLECOIN MARKET CAPITALIZATION SURPASSES $250 BILLION (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 The total stablecoin market cap has surpassed $250 billion for the
first time, driven by regulatory momentum and surging DeFi adoption.
USDT leads with $153B, followed by USDC at $60.9B, amid the
advancement of the U.S. GENIUS Act and Hong Kong's licensing
framework. With TradFi firms eyeing joint stablecoin ventures and DEX
volumes hitting record shares, analysts expect the stablecoin market
could double by 2026. 

 YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO CRYPTO IN 2025 (25 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Crypto Twitter is saturated with shillers and extractive tactics,
making genuine alpha nearly impossible to find from popular accounts.
Newcomers should avoid buying tokens based on public endorsements,
especially from large profiles, as most are paid or have undisclosed
positions. Airdrop farming remains one of the cleaner ways to
participate, and platforms like Kaito can help smaller voices get
noticed more ethically. Ultimately, succeed by spending more time
learning, curating your feed, and risking less capital.
