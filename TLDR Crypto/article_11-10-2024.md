 SEC CHAIR GARY GENSLER ON CRYPTO: ‘IT'S UNLIKELY THIS STUFF IS
GONNA BE A CURRENCY' (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SEC Chair Gary Gensler expressed skepticism about cryptocurrencies
like Bitcoin ever becoming widely used as currencies, instead viewing
them as more of a store of value. He defended the SEC's aggressive
enforcement actions against crypto companies, emphasizing the need for
strong enforcement due to the prevalence of fraud in the crypto space,
adding that existing regulations, like the Howey Test, are sufficient
for overseeing the industry. 

 US CHARGES 3 COMPANIES, 15 PEOPLE WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY FRAUD (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 In an FBI-led investigation, three companies and fifteen individuals
have been charged with fraud and market manipulation after agreeing to
promote an FBI-created crypto security. The individuals and companies
agreed to inflate token trading volume before selling tokens, a
classic “pump and dump” scheme.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 DELTA: A NETWORK OF NETWORKS WITH SHARED STATE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Delta introduces a “network of networks” architecture that
separates execution and settlement. It uses zk-settlement and a
leaderless consensus protocol to balance sovereignty and
interoperability. It has a shared global state and native
interoperability between “domains,” allowing for appchains and
rollups to have lower barriers to entry and communication.

DeFi on Ethereum, aimed at improving transaction speed, reducing
costs, and simplifying cross-chain swaps. The platform includes

 THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO CHAIN ABSTRACTION (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Chain abstraction is a solution to onchain liquidity and experience
fragmentation that simplifies crosschain user experiences. The CAKE
Framework outlines a structured approach using Permission, Solver, and
Settlement layers, with projects that implement abstraction at
application, account, and blockchain levels. Despite challenges around
security, standardization, and decentralization, chain abstraction
promises to enhance interoperability and usability in these
increasingly fragmented ecosystems. 

 WTF IS FINALITY? (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Finality in blockchains refers to the point when a transaction
becomes permanently and irreversibly part of the ledger, much like how
wet concrete eventually hardens into a solid state. This article uses
this analogy to explain how different blockchain systems, like
Ethereum and Bitcoin, achieve finality — Ethereum through validator
consensus over epochs and Bitcoin through the longest chain rule in
Proof of Work, though Bitcoin never truly reaches a final,
irreversible state.

 TRUMP-LINKED WORLD LIBERTY FINANCIAL TO RAISE $300 MILLION AT $1.5
BILLION VALUATION: ROADMAP (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 World Liberty Financial, a DeFi project tied to Donald Trump and his
sons, is set to raise $300 million by selling 20% of its governance
token supply at a $1.5 billion valuation. The token, initially
non-transferable for 12 months, will allow holders to vote on platform
development, with the project's roadmap including DeFi lending, KYC
integration, and fractionalizing real-world assets for digital
finance. 

 CRYPTO MARKET VIEWS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The effectiveness of Fed rate cuts and China's stimulus in
influencing the crypto market has been overstated, with the impact of
global liquidity on crypto prices being less direct than for stocks.
Despite some market participants expecting these factors to strongly
boost crypto prices, the actual market dynamics, including capital
flows between crypto and traditional Chinese stocks, suggest a more
nuanced influence with ongoing corrections possible due to high
leverage.
