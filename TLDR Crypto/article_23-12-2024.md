MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINDESK STAFFERS CALL JUSTIN SUN RETRACTION 'OUTRAGEOUS' AHEAD OF
LEADERSHIP FIRINGS (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bullish, CoinDesk's parent company, has fired three senior editorial
leaders including Editor-in-Chief Kevin Reynolds following controversy
over a retracted article about Justin Sun. Sun's team demanded the
article's removal, which led CoinDesk staff to send a letter to
executives challenging the company's increasing control over editorial
decisions. To further complicate matters, Sun's cryptocurrency Tron is
a major sponsor of CoinDesk's upcoming Consensus conference. 

 BITCOIN SOCIAL SENTIMENT DROPS TO YEARLY LOW, SIGNALING BTC BREAKOUT
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin's social sentiment has dropped to its lowest point in 2024,
signaling potential for a recovery above $100K, as historical patterns
would suggest an end to the current correction. Analysts remain
optimistic about Bitcoin's trajectory, predicting a strong recovery by
2025, potentially reaching $160K amid improving macroeconomic
conditions.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GIGGLE ACADEMY: CZ'S EDUCATION INITIATIVE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has launched Giggle Academy, a free
AI-enabled education platform that uses gamification and blockchain to
make education addictive and fun. It is targeted at underserved
populations globally and focuses on practical, job-ready skills rather
than traditional academic lessons. It uses Soulbound tokens for
verifiable credentials and a gamified learning system to target the
781 million illiterate adults and 500 million children without access
to schooling. 

 EIGENLAYER INTRODUCES SLASHING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The proposed EigenLayer upgrade, “Slashing,” introduces critical
features like Unique Stake Allocation and Operator Sets to improve
security, accountability, and innovation in the ecosystem. This will
enable AVS' to enforce cryptoeconomic commitments and incentivize
performance. The upgrade is currently live on the Holesky testnet,
with a mainnet launch expected in Q1 2025.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ETH'S LONG-TERM VALUE PROPOSITION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Base's decision to subsidize gas costs in USDC highlights a debate
about ETH's long term value proposition and challenges the notion that
L2 adoption inherently benefits ETH. While L2s successfully extend
Ethereum's utility as a settlement layer, Base's USDC subsidies
exemplify how L2s might actually abstract away ETH's
“internet-native money” and store of value propositions.
Ethereum's success in exporting execution to L2s, while technically
beneficial, could undermine its monetary premium if users primarily
interact with stablecoins, making its deflationary mechanics and fee
capture more important. 

 AI AGENTS IN 2024: A RECAP (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The AI agent ecosystem exploded in 2024, starting with Truth
Terminal's viral success and Virtuals pioneering agent tokenization,
which lead to early innovations in entertainment, finance, and
infrastructure agents. Notable developments include specialized
frameworks like AgentKit and AgentTank, while platforms focused on
real-world utility through DeFi integration, trading automation, and
chain abstraction. The market has shown particular interest in
projects developing proprietary frameworks and infrastructure, with
successful teams combining unique fine-tuned models with no-code tools
for broader adoption.

 CRITIQUING THE OPEN-SOURCE AI HEDGE FUND (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The open-source “real-world AI hedge fund” repo gaining attention
on Twitter allegedly relies on overly simplistic logic and GPT-4
prompts to decide and execute on trades. It does not have core
elements of quant finance like robust signal generation, predictive
modeling, and feedback loops for machine learning. True AI-driven
trading involves building large, well-curated datasets, selecting
meaningful targets, and training models to uncover nonlinear
relationships between signals and price movements, as shown by more
structured projects like the “Stock Market Analysis + Prediction
Using LSTM” notebook on Kaggle. 

 ETHEREUM HAS AN INCENTIVES PROBLEM (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In Ethereum, validators should be incentivized to run a node to earn
rewards from the proof of stake consensus mechanism. However, due to
the prevalence of liquid staking tokens like Lido, and restaking
protocols offering additional yield on staked ETH, incentives for
validators are misaligned and heavily favor the end user. Solo stakers
are driven out of the market by larger LST providers, and there needs
to be some change allowing for small stakers to have stronger
incentives to promote decentralization.
