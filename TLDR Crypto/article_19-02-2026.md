MARKETS & BUSINESS

 STABLECOINS HIT $300BN AND STALLED (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Stablecoin supply stalled at $300 billion after October's worst-ever
leverage wipeout, as lower crypto trading volumes reduced demand for
dollar-pegged liquidity vehicles, and USD weakness made
dollar-denominated yields less attractive. Analysts describe market
psychology as fear-driven, where good news fails to register, while
the US Dollar Index falling 11% since January 2025 aligns with the
Trump administration's explicit dollar-weakening export policy, with
no near-term reversal expected. Long-term drivers remain intact as
tokenization embeds stablecoins into financial infrastructure beyond
trading, with BlackRock, JPMorgan, Visa, and NYSE launching stablecoin
products targeting institutional settlement, collateral, and gig
economy payments as the next growth phase tied to real financial
activity rather than crypto market cycles. 

 ETHZILLA STOCK PLUMMETS AS PETER THIEL EXITS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Peter Thiel and Founders Fund exited their entire 7.5% stake in
ETHZilla at the end of 2025, with SEC filings triggering an 8% stock
drop as the former biotech firm that raised $425 million in August to
pivot to an Ethereum treasury trades 97% below its record high. Only
one crypto corporate treasury company outperformed the S&P 500 as of
December, as the Strategy-inspired model faced broader headwinds
across dozens of publicly traded firms that raised billions to buy
cryptocurrencies. ETHZilla is pivoting toward tokenization, acquiring
a home loan portfolio for blockchain issuance on an undisclosed L2 and
tokenizing two commercial jet engines for $12.2 million as it attempts
to differentiate from pure treasury plays.

 BRIDGE WINS CONDITIONAL OCC APPROVAL FOR NATIONAL TRUST BANK CHARTER
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bridge has received conditional approval from the OCC to organize a
federally chartered national trust bank, which would allow it to offer
digital asset custody, stablecoin issuance, orchestration, and reserve
management under direct federal oversight once finalized. The charter
positions Bridge to operate within a clear US regulatory framework
aligned with emerging standards like the GENIUS Act, giving
enterprises and financial institutions a compliant path to build
stablecoin-powered payments and treasury infrastructure at a
nationwide scale. 

 WEB 4.0: THE BIRTH OF SUPERINTELLIGENT LIFE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A developer claims to have built an autonomous AI system called "The
Automaton" capable of earning onchain, self-improving, and replicating
without human intervention, framing the concept as Web 4.0. The agents
have a wallet and pay for their operating costs – including hosting,
LLM inference, and a domain name – via x402. Automatons can spawn
new child agents that can do the same, in the first real-time
experiment of a fully autonomous, economically independent agent.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE NAKAMOTO HEIST (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 David Bailey merged Nakamoto Holdings into public shell KindlyMD in
May 2025, raising $710M at $1.12/share while retail investors bought
in at $28-31. The stock pumped to 23x NAV before collapsing 99% to
$0.29, generating $97M in quarterly losses, including $14.45M in debt
extinguishment costs from cycling through three lenders in a single
week. Amid the collapse, Bailey exercised a call option embedded in
the original merger documents to acquire Bitcoin Magazine, Bitcoin
Conference, and UTXO Management using 363.6M shares priced at $1.12,
approximately 4x the current market price, consolidating his entire
media, events, and hedge fund operation into the public vehicle at
insider-favorable terms. The company now faces Nasdaq delisting risk
for failing the $1 minimum bid price threshold with a June 8 deadline,
while simultaneously having filed a $5B at-the-market equity offering
with the SEC. 

 100 LEARNINGS FROM FIVE YEARS AS A CRYPTO DEGEN (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Virtually all tokens trend toward zero by default, making selectivity
the core competency, while bear markets paradoxically generate the
most durable projects and protocols. CT functions primarily as an
undisclosed promotion engine, and the most actionable alpha
concentrates in sub-10K follower accounts and small trusted private
group chats rather than prominent influencer feeds. For proper risk
management, set exit prices before entering positions, take profits
aggressively, maintain cash reserves outside of crypto, and treat
mental health as a higher-priority asset than portfolio performance.

 ADVERSE SELECTION IS DEFI'S CORE MARKET STRUCTURE PROBLEM (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 DeFi's biggest structural flaw is adverse selection, where
transparent onchain order flow allows informed traders and MEV
searchers to extract value, forcing market makers to widen spreads and
raising costs for everyone. The post outlines six mitigation
strategies: delays, hiding intent, flow segmentation, dynamic pricing,
refusing flow, and social coordination. Execution design is the next
competitive frontier for DEXs seeking tighter spreads, better UX, and
sustainable liquidity. 

 AAVE-CHAN INITIATIVE CLAIMS $4.6M SPEND DROVE $68M+ IN AAVE REVENUE
(5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Aave-Chan Initiative's (ACI's) transparency report argues that $4.6M
paid over three years helped scale Aave protocol revenue from $5.2M to
$142M, with two core strategies. The LRT/eMode WETH borrow loop and
the Ethena/Pendle integration drove over $68M in annualized revenue,
including $37M from WETH alone and $18.5M from Ethena-related assets.
The report highlights $101M in incentives deployed (80%
partner-funded), major BD wins like the Ethereum Foundation's 30,800
ETH deposit, and 845 governance proposals initiated, while contrasting
its $3M annual cost with a newly proposed ~$51M budget request now
under DAO review.

the network's history, marking a major milestone in ETH's transition
