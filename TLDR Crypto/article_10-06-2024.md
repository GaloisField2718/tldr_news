MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Binance has self-reported reaching over 200 million global users with
over $100 billion in user assets under custody. 30 million users
joined in 2024, and the largest exchange by volume is on track to

consumers, Binance accounts for 36% of the total user base. 

 ARTHUR HAYES ON CRYPTO BULL MARKET (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, suggested that the crypto bull
market is coming back because of recent interest rate cuts by the Bank
of Canada and the European Central Bank, potentially marking the start
of a global easing cycle. He speculated about further rate cuts by
other central banks, and took a cautious stance on the U.S. Fed's
actions given the proximity to the presidential election. Hayes
ultimately concluded by encouraging investments in bitcoin and other
crypto in light of these developments.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 THE NEED FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE ZERO KNOWLEDGE PROVING (7 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 ZK proving is critical for scaling Ethereum and realizing the vision
of verifiable computing for a wide range of applications. Much like
how improvements in prior IT systems have exponentially increased mass
adoption of computers, reducing proving costs could bring ZK to AI,
IoT, and the rest of the internet. Efficiency improvements require
leveraging parallel processing, application-specific hardware, and
acceleration systems with direct memory access. 

 HIVEMAPPER CONTINUES SCALING CRYPTO-BASED MAPPING (7 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Hivemapper, a crypto-based mapping initiative, uses dash cams
installed in cars (around the world) to gather real-time mapping data,
presenting an alternative to traditional, often outdated, and costly
mapping methods used by companies like Google. This approach
democratizes data collection, leading to updated and more economically
efficient mapping.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 DEEP DIVE INTO COINBASE SMART WALLET (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Coinbase has introduced a new Smart Wallet, offering a self-custodial
solution that uses biometrics and a passkey system to secure
transactions via a user-specific smart contract. This innovative
approach ensures that users retain sole ownership of their wallet,
with multiple layers of recovery provided by iCloud Keychain and
Google Password Manager, minimizing reliance on intermediaries and
enhancing user control and security in managing their digital assets. 

 GAS FEES IN BLOCKCHAIN (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Gas fees on blockchains compensate validators for their computational
work and help prevent DDoS attacks. Fees vary based on blockchain
activity, transaction complexity, and a user's willingness to pay.
Ethereum's fees are higher due to its focus on decentralization and
comparatively lower computational demands, leading to network
congestion. In contrast, Solana's more powerful network (more
centralized) allows for faster processing and lower fees. Gas fees are
not retained by Ethereum's creators (e.g., Vitalik Buterin), they are
used for validator rewards and partially burned, supporting the
token's value.

 CRYPTO PRODUCT MISTAKES (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The most common pitfalls in crypto product development include
misidentifying user needs, incorrectly defining target market
segments, delegating crucial functions like marketing to less
experienced staff, haphazardly adapting Web2 ideas into Web3 without
genuine innovation, overemphasizing the blockchain choice due to its
existing user base, and blindly following industry trends without
original thought. Each of these errors stems from a fundamental
misunderstanding of the market and the unique capabilities offered by
crypto. 

 SYNAPSE TROUBLES WITH BANKING PARTNER HIGHLIGHTS IMPORTANCE OF
BRINGING FUNDS ONCHAIN (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The situation involving Synapse (banking service provider), Evolve
(banking partner), and numerous fintech startups highlights a
significant problem in tracking and verifying the location of customer
deposits. These issues could be solved by bringing funds onchain.
Blockchain tech is a transparent and immutable ledger and could thus
resolve uncertainties about the flow of funds and improve overall
financial transparency and trust.
