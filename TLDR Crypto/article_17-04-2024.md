 BITCOIN PRICE SLIPS BELOW 62K (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin's price has dropped below $62,000. Analysts attribute the
decrease to geopolitical tensions, a strengthening dollar, and
volatility ahead of the upcoming halving. The wider crypto market has
similarly fallen, with large cap cryptocurrencies experiencing
double-digit losses and liquidations occurring across the market.

open-sourced to maximize Reth performance and enable experimentation
with cutting-edge Ethereum research. AlphaNet aims to break the
gigagas barrier and tackle the state growth problem while implementing
three new Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) not yet available on
other networks. Built using the modular Reth SDK, AlphaNet allows for
extreme customization without forking the node, enabling developers to
experiment with custom RPCs, EVMs, and block builders.

on Bitcointalk to their growing presence on Twitter in 2024,
highlighting their role in each cycle of the crypto ecosystem. It also
touches on the psychology behind memecoin trading (a blend of minimal
research and luck, among other items). Many memecoin collections are
highly concentrated within the top 10 holders. 

 ZKSUMMIT 2024 FIELD NOTES (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 a16z research partner Joseph Bonneau documented his experience at the
11th zkSummit in Athens. ZK hardware has been accelerating support for
faster proof generation, which, when paired with a zkVM, could achieve
a 1000x overhead over primitive computation and potentially become
part of Ethereum's final version. Decentralized prover networks
promise to create more competitive and distributed markets for
generating proofs for L2s and other applications. Instead of
re-creating identification systems, protocols like ZK Email and
zkPassport are building upon existing systems for greater anonymity
and applicability.
