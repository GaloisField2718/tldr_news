 TRUMP-BACKED AMERICAN BITCOIN SOARS IN NASDAQ DEBUT (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 American Bitcoin (ABTC), co-founded by Eric Trump and backed by
Donald Trump Jr., jumped nearly 17% to $8.04 per share in its Nasdaq
debut, with intraday highs of $14 and 29M shares traded. The company
blends BTC mining, at reportedly half the market cost, and direct
accumulation, supported by Hut 8's infrastructure, which retains an
80% stake. The debut values Eric Trump's stake at over $500M, while
both Trump sons continue expanding into DeFi and crypto ventures,
including World Liberty Financial and Polymarket. 

 POLYMARKET CLEARED TO OPERATE IN THE U.S. BY CFTC (2 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Polymarket has received a green light from the CFTC to operate in the
U.S. after the regulator issued a no-action letter regarding certain
swap data reporting and recordkeeping rules. The approval follows
Polymarket's acquisition of derivatives exchange QCEX and the dropping
of a federal investigation earlier this summer. With backing from
Donald Trump Jr. and a partnership with Elon Musk's X, Polymarket is
set to expand as prediction markets continue to gain momentum, though
activity remains below January's peak.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 LINEA TOKEN RELEASES SEPT 10 WITH AIRDROP (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 LINEA will launch its Token Generation Event on September 10. An
eligibility checker is now live. The token features an unusual
allocation structure with 85% dedicated to ecosystem development (10%
for early users and builders, 75% for an ecosystem fund) and notably
zero allocations for team or venture capital investors. Airdrop
eligibility is determined through LXP and LXP-L campaign
participation, requiring minimum thresholds of 2,000 LXP across seven
tiers and 15,000 LXP-L, respectively. Claims will be available from
September 10 to December 9. LINEA operates as an Ethereum Layer 2
solution featuring native yield on bridged assets and a dual burn
mechanism for both ETH and LINEA tokens, positioning itself as
complementary to rather than competitive with Ethereum's base layer. 

 GALAXY LAUNCHES GLXY TOKENIZED PUBLIC SHARES ON SOLANA (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Galaxy Digital (GLXY) has partnered with Superstate to become the
first public company to tokenize SEC-registered equity directly on a
major blockchain, launching tokenized shares on Solana through
Superstate's Opening Bell platform. Unlike synthetic or wrapper
models, these are actual Galaxy Digital Class A Common Stock with full
shareholder rights, where Superstate serves as the SEC-registered
transfer agent recording legal ownership onchain in real-time. The
tokenized shares are immediately available to KYC'd investors and
offer 24/7 market access with near-instant settlement, while Galaxy
and Superstate are exploring regulatory-compliant integration with
Automated Market Makers and DeFi platforms.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT KINETIQ, THINK BIGGER (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Kinetiq has evolved from Hyperliquid's liquid staking protocol into a
financial hub that democratizes perpetual market deployment by solving
HIP-3's prohibitive 1 million HYPE capital requirement through its
Launch platform. The Launch service enables crowdfunded exchange
deployment where multiple participants pool HYPE capital and receive
exchange-specific LSTs that entitle holders to trading fee revenue,
effectively turning them into "micro-exchange equity." Unlike
traditional liquid staking protocols with capped yields, Kinetiq's
value capture model is theoretically unlimited since each new exchange
deployed through Launch creates an additional revenue stream for
participants. With perpetual futures representing crypto's clearest
product-market fit and monthly trading volumes growing from $35
billion to $6.4 trillion, Kinetiq has positioned itself as the
coordination layer for scaling Hyperliquid's exchange infrastructure
while offering institutional solutions and yield aggregation services.


 THE PREDICTION MARKET SUPERCYCLE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Prediction markets represent the evolution of crypto speculation and
will eventually replace memecoins and traditional betting platforms
due to their superior structure of time-bounded speculation with clear
resolution mechanisms. While speculation has always driven crypto
adoption, current models like memecoins fail because "attention is
ephemeral, tokens last forever," leading to inevitable downtrends once
viral moments fade. Prediction markets solve this by containing
speculative energy to relevant time periods and providing users with
understandable win/loss outcomes, making them a more satisfying
alternative to perpetual token speculation. The vision of a
"prediction market supercycle" sees these platforms eventually
monetizing all forms of attention and replacing casinos, sportsbooks,
and news platforms, though this requires infrastructure improvements
to bootstrap liquidity for smaller, long-tail events beyond just
high-profile outcomes.

 DEX TRADER REALITY CHECK (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A viral chart suggested Solana had 8M daily DEX traders last
November, but deeper analysis shows 80% of those wallets were one-day
users, many tied to "fake holder" tactics by token devs to boost
stats. In reality, active repeat traders peaked around 2M in January
and sit closer to 500-600K today. The correction highlights how
inflated wallet counts can distort perceptions of true onchain
activity. 

 US FED TO HOST PAYMENTS INNOVATION CONFERENCE ON CRYPTO AND AI (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Federal Reserve will host a payments innovation conference on
October 21 covering stablecoins, tokenization, AI, and DeFi, signaling
that digital assets are being treated as core to payment
infrastructure. Innovation has always been central to meeting consumer
and business needs, while industry voices stress the need for clear
rules recognizing stablecoins as settlement assets and setting
standards for tokenized credit markets. The event, part of a packed
global policy calendar, will feature regulators, academics, and
industry leaders and will be livestreamed on the Fed's website.
