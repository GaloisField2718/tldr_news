GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 REFLECTIONS ON MY FIRST BULL AND BEAR CYCLE: LESSONS LEARNED (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 From building startups to navigating the highs and lows of crypto,
Hitesh Malviya shares his firsthand experience of making and losing
millions during the 2017 bull run and 2018 crash. In 2017, while
leveraging the ICO boom, his project was transformed into a crypto
media outlet generating $1M in revenue as altcoin interest surged.
Then, the 2018 bear market erased 95% of his portfolio, highlighting
key lessons on the risks of altcoin-heavy investments, greed, and
emotional trading.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ETHEREUM IS BLEEDING VALUE (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum is losing value to L2 rollups, which extract fees, MEV, and
liquidity while paying minimal costs for Ethereum's security. L2s
should contribute back to Ethereum through mechanisms like staking
ETH, reallocating fees, or redistributing MEV to ensure the network
captures its fair share of value and remains sustainable. 

 HYPERLIQUID THESIS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Hyperliquid is set to transform onchain finance with its novel perp
DEX, integrated HyperCore (handling order book trading, staking,
etc.), HyperEVM ecosystems (the execution layer for smart contract
deployment), and innovative features like the Assistance Fund (which
collects trading fees to buy back the HYPE token) and builder codes.
These features together deliver superior liquidity, low fees, and
robust security compared to traditional exchanges, while its organic
growth, absence of VC interference, and passionate community position
it as a dominant force in DeFi. 

 FUTURE OF AI & CRYPTO (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI and crypto will continue to lower barriers to innovation without
fully replacing the need for human expertise, as domain-specific
knowledge remains critical to guiding AI outputs (e.g., prompting).
While routine tasks may be automated, the unique value of authentic
human experience and creativity will become even more important, even
as new autonomous AI applications evolve.
