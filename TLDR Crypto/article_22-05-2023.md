SANCTIONED CRYPTO MIXER TORNADO CASH HIJACKED BY HACKERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [https://archive.ph/TiNtE?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

Tornado Cash, a crypto mixing service, was overtaken via a hostile
hacking operation. A malicious actor created 1.2 million counterfeit
votes, surpassing the 700,000 legitimate ones, enabling them to seize
complete control of Tornado Cash's governance. Following this exploit,
the attacker withdrew and sold 10,000 TORN. Consequently, crypto
exchange Binance temporarily halted TORN deposits and the token's
value dropped 44%. Tornado Cash, used extensively for money laundering
including by North Korean hackers, according to the US Treasury
Department, which sanctioned Tornado Cash last year, has facilitated
over $8 billion in transactions since its inception in 2019.

[https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/press-releases/2023/05/20230518-4/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has announced the start of its e-HKD
Pilot Program, with 16 companies selected to participate. The first
round of pilots for 2023 will investigate potential use cases across
six categories, including programmable payments and tokenized asset
settlement. The program is a significant part of HKMA's three-rail
strategy for the potential implementation of a retail CBDC. While this
program is a big step toward a CBDC for Hong Kong, a firm decision to
introduce e-HKD has not yet been made.

[https://toybook.com/pmi-kids-world-unleashes-pudgy-penguins-collection/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Last week, Pudgy Penguins launched its toy line, Pudgy Toys, through
PMI Kids, following a successful soft release last month. The
collection includes plush toys, figurines with interchangeable
accessories, and surprise figures, all inspired by the original Pudgy
Penguins collection on Ethereum. Each toy includes a code for a
digital collectible and customization options. Already, two toys from
the line have made Amazon's Top 10 for new releases. The collection
will soon be available at Walmart and other retailers and will be
featured at the Licensing Expo in Las Vegas next month. This is a
unique approach by an NFT company to try and become a mainstream IP
powerhouse, beloved by children, on par with Club Penguin, Mickey
Mouse, or Hello Kitty.

[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1659596504628183047.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Mina has announced its incentivized Testnet - Testworld Mission 2.0,
as an opportunity for validators, zkApp developers, and users to test
the Mina blockchain prior to its upcoming hard fork. The goal is to
thoroughly test the network under various conditions and ensure that
SnarkyJS and code related to zkApps function correctly. The initiative
features four tracks: zkApp End-to-End Testing, External Security
Auditing, Protocol & Performance Testing, and Preparation for the Hard
Fork. The first track is complete, the next two are ongoing, and the
final track will commence soon.

THE EFFICIENCIES OF VALIDITY PROOFS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://polynya.mirror.xyz/dFSZi_EhEsktLVxFL1ako8EdxFBOWbW2Skfwd2NyG6A?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This article gives an overview of validity proofs, which offer
significant advantages for blockchain tech, providing faster, cheaper,
and easier-to-verify execution layers. These proofs allow even a
low-end device to validate transactions at extremely high throughput.
Such a system requires less computational network resources, making it
less expensive than conventional blockchains that need thousands of
nodes reprocessing transactions. 

HOW DAOS CAN BE WORTH MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1659170342529814528.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This thread explains how DAOs can become more valuable after
dissolution, benefiting token holders. Some DAOs have faced "slow rug"
situations, where funds are covertly drained over time, leading to
their dissolution. For instance, Rook DAO and Fei's Tribe DAO shut
down, benefiting token holders through substantial asset
distributions. A group called Risk Free Value Raiders has been
reportedly exploiting DAOs with treasury value lower than their
token's market cap by voting to dissolve the DAO. Despite challenges
and criticism, this strategy presents an intriguing arbitrage
opportunity in DeFi.

DON'T OVERLOAD ETHEREUM'S CONSENSUS (23 MINUTES)
[https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/05/21/dont_overload.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This essay from Vitalik analyzes potential strategies for the Ethereum
network's consensus mechanism and discusses the potential risks of
several novel proposals. It differentiates between low-risk practices,
such as dual-use of validator-staked ETH and high-risk ones, which
attempt to use Ethereum's social consensus for personal applications.
Vitalik strongly discourages the latter due to the high systemic risk
it brings. The essay emphasizes the importance of preserving the
purity and minimalism of the blockchain and avoiding the overextension
of its consensus mechanism. It suggests alternative strategies for
security, like decentralized oracles or DAO-based court systems, for
achieving these goals without endangering the network. 

CRYPTO TRADING TAKES A `FEW STEPS BACKâ€™ AFTER JANE STREET, JUMP
RETREAT (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/J0kzB?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

TradFi funds that were heavily involved in crypto market making like
Jane Street and Jump have been pulling out from the space in the US
due to increased regulatory scrutiny, leading to decreased liquidity
and potentially scaring away other institutional investors. This
retreat and the subsequent liquidity issues have caused price
instability in crypto markets. This has created a dynamic in the
market where bigger investors are sidelined or inactive as they worry
about causing large price fluctuations and smaller investors that are
still trading are subject to greater volatility.

Following up on his recent thread on crypto yield, Cochran explains
