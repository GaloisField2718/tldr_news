 FTX ESTATE FACES ESTIMATED $3 TO $5 BILLION IN US GOVERNMENT CLAIMS
AMID BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS, COURT FILING SHOWS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX is reportedly facing claims totaling
$3-5 billion from the U.S. government in addition to its customer
claims. Payouts to customers, lenders for Alameda Research,
administrative expenses, and non-government creditors will be
prioritized before governmental or tax claims. The final amount owed
for US tax claims will be uncertain until all other claims are
settled. 

 VITALIK BUTERIN TALKS ‚ÄòRAINBOW STAKING‚Äô AT ETHTAIPEI TO COMBAT
CENTRALIZATION RISKS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has introduced Rainbow Staking as a
solution to the growing centralization concerns around staking. At
present, Ethereum requires solo stakers to deposit 32 ETH, leading to
individuals delegating their tokens to liquid staking solutions like
Lido. Rainbow Staking would counter this by splitting up staking into
heavy and light stakes.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PARTICLE NETWORK: THE MODULAR L1 POWERING CHAIN ABSTRACTION (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Particle Network is developing an L1 to abstract away other chains
and simplify user interactions with various blockchains. Particle
Network's new chain aims to unify liquidity and allow gas payments
with any token. 900 dApps across 56 chains securing $2B are already
utilizing Particle‚Äôs Wallet Abstraction services, making streamlined
integration into the new L1 infrastructure easier. 

 YIELD ROUTES: THE FIRST PERMISSIONLESS YIELD-GENERATING BRIDGES (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hyperlane is launching Yield Routes, yield-generating bridges that
enable L2-bridged assets to compound yields automatically. The move
transforms traditional bridged assets, which are typically
unproductive, into productive ones. Yield Routes are constructed on
Hyperlane's Warp Routes and are compatible with any ERC-4626 vault,
offering passive yield opportunities across any chain. They are open
for anyone to deploy and customize, creating the possibility for
unique yield opportunities and incentive mechanisms.

 NFT PULSE: THE SOURCE FOR CRYPTO NFT DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Electric Capital has launched a new NFT dashboard called NFT Pulse to
visualize market activity across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and
Polygon at a glance. In addition to simple market-wide activity like
user counts and volumes, this dashboard also shows overall market
share across chains, a unique way of looking at NFT data that many
other dashboards do not show. It also breaks down the revenue
generated by each marketplace, another unique dataset that is usually
difficult to find. 

 HALVING HANDBOOK: A PRIMER FOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 April's Bitcoin halving, a method designed to counter inflation by
limiting the supply of new bitcoins, will reduce miners' rewards by
half. This guide gives a high-level overview of the event for
institutional investors. Historically, Bitcoin has seen price surges
after halving events due to a shift in supply-demand dynamics. Gains
after halvings have been more muted with each cycle. People should be
wary of looking at past cycles to predict what will happen with this
halving as there are only a few data points to go off of.

 ON TRADING ADDICTION (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post talks about trading addiction in crypto, outlining its
symptoms, effects, and ways to manage it. It highlights how unhealthy
addiction can lead to compulsive behaviors and emotional trading
decisions. Not all addiction is bad. Traders should spend time on
research rather than impulsive trades. Slow down, use leverage wisely,
and turn the passion for trading into informed decision-making to
maintain financial stability. 

 MEMECOINS BEING USED TO BOOTSTRAP DAPP LIQUIDITY (2 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Early-stage projects are using memecoins to boost user engagement and
liquidity rather than their own utility tokens. Notably, Perl.xyz
rewards users with $degen for daily games participation, and
Drakulaapp, a new on-chain TikTok, offers creator rewards. Superfluid
has developed a feature that enables continuous $degen earnings
directly into users' wallets. This trend suggests that memecoins are
not just gaining 'utility' but also helping bootstrap early userbases
for projects across the ecosystem.
