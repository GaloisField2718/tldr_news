 BALANCER HIT BY POTENTIAL $128M EXPLOIT ON ETHEREUM (4 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Balancer, an Ethereum-based DEX and automated portfolio manager,
appears to have been exploited for over $128.6 million, with large
outflows detected from its vaults. Blockchain security firm PeckShield
and analytics providers like Nansen flagged unusual transfers,
including 6,587 WETH ($24.5M), 6,851 osETH ($26.9M), and 4,260 wstETH
($19.3M). Balancer confirmed it is “aware of a potential exploit”
affecting V2 pools and is working with security teams to assess the
damage. Early reports suggest the breach stemmed from a faulty smart
contract check, possibly impacting older V2 forks across multiple
chains. 

 NOVEMBER THE NEW OCTOBER FOR CRYPTO ETFS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Four crypto ETFs launched this week using a procedural shortcut
requiring "no delaying amendment" language in S-1 filings that
automatically become effective after 20 days unless the SEC issues a
stay, which circumvents problems caused by the government shutdown.
Fidelity and Canary Capital filed updated S-1s on Thursday for spot
Solana and XRP ETFs, respectively, which could launch as early as
November 13 if the SEC doesn't intervene. Some filings like XRP
haven't received SEC feedback, unlike reviewed Solana, HBAR, and
Litecoin applications, potentially prompting the agency to halt
automatic approval.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ZCASH Q4 2025 ROADMAP (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Electric Coin Co. unveiled its Q4 2025 roadmap for Zcash, which
focuses on ephemeral addresses for every swap via NEAR Intents
protocol, automatic transparent address generation after receiving
funds, and Keystone hardware wallet improvements. ZEC price surged
from $50 in mid-September to $420, while Orchard protocol shielded
supply crossed 4.1 million tokens, with the bulk of growth occurring
since mid-September. The roadmap builds on the August 28 decentralized
off-ramp and October 1 on-ramp releases in the Zashi wallet. 

 HONG KONG OPENS ACCESS TO GLOBAL CRYPTO LIQUIDITY POOLS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will now allow
licensed local crypto exchanges to share global order books with their
international counterparts, a major step toward integrating the city's
markets into the global crypto liquidity network. The move marks a
shift from Hong Kong's previous pre-funded, closed-border settlement
model, allowing exchanges to offer better price discovery and
competitiveness.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MUST-WATCH DAPPS AFTER MONAD MAINNET LAUNCH (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Monad launched its airdrop claim portal on October 14 ahead of
mainnet, with 293 dApps in its ecosystem directory leveraging
technical features like MonadBFT, parallel execution, and MonadDB for
onchain order books and high-performance applications impossible on
other EVMs. Top-funded projects include liquid staking protocol
aPriori, spot DEX Kuru, and perp DEX Perpl. The ecosystem shows strong
clustering around CLOB-based DEXs, prediction markets, and AI
infrastructure, though analysis notes a lack of stablecoin and RWA
projects despite the Monad Foundation's July acquisition of Portal. 

 UNSECURED STABLECOIN CREDIT (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The $1.21 trillion US credit card market hasn't seen major structural
innovation since Capital One introduced risk-based pricing in the
1990s, creating an opportunity to shift unsecured consumer credit to
stablecoin rails with real-time receivable tokenization. One proposed
model allows issuers to tokenize card receivables between
authorization and settlement, receiving instant USDC funding from
decentralized credit pools before repaying via smart contracts when
borrowers pay. Transaction-level underwriting pioneered by BNPL
lenders like Affirm produces discrete, standardized receivables ideal
for specialized onchain credit pools targeting specific borrower
profiles or purchase categories with dynamic pricing. The shift
requires rebuilding credit infrastructure, including decentralized
identity systems, lender credibility assessments replacing S&P/Moody's
ratings, and onchain-integrated collections mechanisms, to complete
the triangle of stablecoin-based saving, yield, and borrowing.

 WHY CRYPTO CAN'T BUILD ANYTHING LONG-TERM (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Crypto's structure makes long-term building nearly impossible, as
founders are trapped in an 18-month narrative cycle where hype
dictates funding, talent, and user attention. Each new trend, from
NFTs to DeFi to AI agents, forces rapid pivots to stay relevant,
leaving most projects perpetually “almost finished” but never
complete. With capital chasing attention, not execution, unfinished
products signal limitless potential while finished ones expose
limitations. Founders, investors, and even users are incentivized to
pivot, not persevere, since the market rewards novelty over
durability. 

 ETHEREUM'S SECURITY DEPENDS ON DECENTRALIZING L2S (3 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Although Ethereum L1 is nearly incorruptible, its Layer 2 ecosystem
still depends too heavily on multisigs and centralized sequencers,
making it vulnerable and incomplete in achieving true Ethereum-level
security. We need to enable decentralized sequencing, through shared
or Based rollup designs, to enable secure, composable liquidity and
state across L1 and L2. Without this, each rollup must rebuild costly
infrastructure like oracles and liquidity, undermining Ethereum's
scaling vision.

primarily from token inflation like Solana staking (>90% from
emissions) and Ethereum (mixed fee/issuance model).
