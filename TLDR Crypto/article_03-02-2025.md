MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN DIPS BELOW $100,000, MEMECOINS PLUMMET AS MARKET RESPONDS TO
US TARIFFS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin fell below $100K as the crypto market reacted to President
Trump's planned tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China,
which prompted retaliatory measures and a lawsuit from China filed
with the WTO. Memecoins were hit hardest, with major Solana-based
tokens and Trump's own memecoin dropping over 30% in the past week
amid broader market uncertainty. 

 SOLANA MEME COIN DOGWIFHAT HAS NO DEAL WITH LAS VEGAS SPHERE, VENUE
SAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Despite a community effort that raised nearly $700,000, The Las Vegas
Sphere has denied any agreement to display the Dogwifhat memecoin and
revealed that no such deal was ever in place. The controversy led to a
35% price spike to WIF following a cryptic social media post from the
team that coincided with a $700,000 move from the project treasury to
an unnamed wallet. The Dogwifhat team claimed that they were working
with an “established brand” to facilitate the advertisement, but
Sphere representatives have explicitly stated that it only accepts
advertising from exchanges and Bitcoin-related content.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRO TO VEILDOTCASH (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Veil Cash is revolutionizing on-chain privacy by allowing users to
deposit ETH into shielded pools, breaking transaction links while
maintaining anonymity through zero-knowledge proofs. With both
Verified and Public Pools, it balances regulatory compliance and full
anonymity, all powered by $VEIL tokens. 

 UNISWAP V4 IS HERE – A NEW ERA OF DEFI (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Over a year and a half after the original announcement, Uniswap v4 is
now live on mainnet across 10 supported chains. Uniswap v4 introduces
hooks, a modular plugin system allowing for customizable pool logic,
with over 150 hooks already developed for features like dynamic fees
and automated liquidity management. It also achieves up to 99.99% gas
savings for pool creation and improved efficiency for multi-hop swaps.
The deployment follows extensive security measures including nine
independent audits and a $15M bug bounty program.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE AGENT MARKET? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The AI agent market is in a severe downturn, with total market cap
dropping 55% from $21.5B to $9.5B over the past month, impacting the
Solana and Base ecosystems equally. The seven major sectors, including
DeFAI, Trading Agents, Gaming, and Frameworks, experienced drawdowns.
The market is entering a consolidating phase marked by natural
selection, where projects maintaining development momentum are likely
to emerge stronger. The current fragmentation across thousands of
agents is expected to resolve through market-driven consolidation of
mindshare and capital. 

 DAO 2.0 PRODUCT IDEAS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There should be community and governance tools like an
agent-associated governance or agent grading of contribution quality.
Agents are great for spinning up quick prediction markets or market
making on existing pools. Since their primary mode of interaction is
on social, they could further advance via memecoin launching,
reputation-based trading, content production, and for connecting users
together. In DeFi, agents could create indices and abstract complex
DeFi management away from the agent.

 ZK-TLS PROJECTS NEARING PMF (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 zk-TLS (Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security) is reaching
product-market fit, with applications like Earnifi using the
technology to access real-time payroll data securely, reducing costs
and improving financial accessibility for workers. As zk-TLS adoption
scales, real-world crypto use cases are quietly gaining traction,
marking a shift from speculative hype to practical implementation. 

 IS THE AI-AGENT NARRATIVE OVER (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The AI Agent narrative cooled off after explosive gains in late 2024,
with many early projects failing to sustain momentum. However,
innovation is driving the next evolution of specialized,
profit-focused agents. The next wave, dubbed DeFAI agents, will focus
on high-value crypto tasks like yield farming and automated trading,
using fine-tuned models and high-quality data to deliver real
profitability while outdated agents that fail to adapt will fade from
relevance.
