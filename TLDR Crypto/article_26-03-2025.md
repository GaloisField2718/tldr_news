GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE STATE OF WEB3 FUNDING - Q1 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Web3 venture funding has declined significantly from its 2022 peak,
with early-stage capital still available but concentrated in fewer,
higher-value deals. As token liquidity dries up, investors are
focusing more on long-term growth and profitability, making it harder
for founders to raise funds without clear market potential. 

 WHERE MONEY MOVES - EDITION #1 (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The “Where Money Moves” newsletter highlights major trends in
stablecoins, including Stripe's $1.1B acquisition of Bridge, Trump's
push for stablecoin legislation, and Tether's massive US Treasury
holdings. With stablecoin adoption surging past $229B in supply and
transaction volumes hitting trillions, the industry is evolving into a
parallel financial system.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OBFUSCATE THE FLOAT, PUMP THE TOKEN. UNCOVERING PLATO'S CAVE OF FALSE
FLOAT/HIGH FDV TOKENS (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Several VC-backed crypto projects are deliberately obscuring the true
circulating supply by maintaining a high reported float while keeping
the real float artificially low. Examples such as Mantra and Movement
illustrate tactics like centralized token control, manipulated airdrop
claims, and strategic backroom deals to facilitate price manipulation.
Crypto is in dire need of transparent reporting and stricter
regulatory oversight. 

 CRYPTO AI MOATS: WHERE CAPITAL AND AGENTS CONVERGE (7 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Crypto AI and DeFI enable autonomous agents to optimize capital
flows, yields, and risk management onchain, surpassing the
capabilities of traditional Web2 systems. Nascent agents are
leveraging decentralized data sources, token incentives, and open
infrastructure to create unique moats that empower them to operate
autonomously and with a higher level of intelligence than standard
models or frameworks allow by default. AI furthers the programmability
and capabilities of onchain primitives like stablecoins, real-world
assets, and lending markets, potentially paving the way for a
“Darwinian evolution” of decentralized agents moving value across
the internet.
