 TETHER TO DOUBLE DOWN ON HIRING (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Tether has grown to about 300 employees and plans to add roughly 150
more over the next 18 months. The hires will be primarily engineers
and some regional regulatory and product hires. Hires will be funded
by rising USDT adoption (market cap ~$185B), while the company deploys
profits into investments across sports, tech, agriculture, and media
and expands globally amid intensifying competition and regulatory
scrutiny. 

 SOUTH KOREA TIGHTENS CRYPTO OVERSIGHT AFTER BITHUMB MIX-UP (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service said it will step up
crypto market supervision and impose tougher penalties for IT failures
after Bithumb accidentally sent 620,000 BTC to users, launching
targeted probes into whale-driven price manipulation, API-based pump
tactics, and false social-media info while forming a task force to
prepare disclosure, exchange licensing, and stablecoin rules under the
forthcoming Digital Asset Basic Act.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 UNBROWSE: 100X FASTER AGENT WEB INTERACTIONS VIA X402 (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Foundry Unbrowse is an open-source tool that accelerates AI agent web
interactions by converting browser automation into direct API calls,
improving speeds from 10-45 seconds to 200ms while boosting
reliability from 70-85% to 95%+. The tool, built as an OpenClaw
plugin, intercepts network traffic to extract underlying API endpoints
and auto-generates TypeScript clients, eliminating resource-intensive
headless Chrome. Foundry plans to launch a marketplace where agents
autonomously trade capabilities using x402 micropayments. 

 DEFI FUD DETECTOR (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post demonstrates how to set up a Claude instance for
adversarial DeFi research in 75 minutes. The AI identified fraud in
thGold and high risks in ETHStrat by prioritizing on-chain data over
official claims. This automated due diligence helps investors bypass
marketing hype to find critical security vulnerabilities.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 INFRASTRUCTURE PILLARS FOR AUTONOMOUS AGENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Virtuals Protocol has outlined infrastructure requirements for
autonomous AI agents, arguing that traditional systems fail because
they assume human operators rather than persistent, value-holding
entities. The framework centers on Identity – featuring proposed
ERC-8004 standard with on-chain wallets as immutable identifiers plus
reputation registries – and Commerce – an Agent Commerce Protocol
enabling discovery, standardized negotiations, and trustless escrow.
All agents deployed on Virtuals currently receive onchain wallets by
default. 

 MULTICOIN CAPITAL'S INVESTMENT THESIS (30 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Multicoin Capital positions blockchains as the fundamental technology
for global capital formation. With DeFi managing $121 billion and
stablecoins exceeding $310 billion, the firm identifies eight themes,
including Fintech 4.0 and programmable ownership, to lead the next
decade of institutional and permissionless financial adoption.

 REFLECTION ON KYLE SAMANI'S MULTICOIN DEPARTURE (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Kyle Samani's departure from Multicoin Capital reflects his
preference for non-consensus, asymmetric bets over managing an
established fund, exemplified by his early Solana thesis viewing it as
an onchain NASDAQ. Despite Multicoin analyzing every perp DEX before
anything launched, they didn't dominate the sector because it became
consensus. Samani is pivoting to launch a DAT company while
Multicoin's remaining team focuses on onchain trading, AI, and
compliance. 

 STOP BUILDING COPYCAT EVM CHAINS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vitalik Buterin has issued a sharp critique of the L2 ecosystem,
arguing that creating "yet another EVM chain" with optimistic bridges
demonstrates a failure of imagination comparable to governance token
forks, especially as L1 scaling will deliver substantial blockspace
independently. He calls for genuine innovation in specific domains
like privacy, application-specific efficiency, and ultra-low latency
rather than generic EVM deployments. On positioning, he distinguishes
between projects deeply integrated with Ethereum (which can
legitimately call themselves Ethereum applications) versus those using
Ethereum for transparency but lacking technical dependence (which
should honestly acknowledge they're pursuing parallel visions).
