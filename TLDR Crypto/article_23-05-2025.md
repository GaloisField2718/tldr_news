MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN HITS NEW RECORD HIGH, SURGING TO $109.4K (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Driven by a 46% rally since April's dip and $3.6 billion of net
inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs in May, Bitcoin surged to a new
all-time high above $109,400, eclipsing the previous peak set on
January 20. Major treasury firms, including Michael Saylor's Strategy
and Twenty One Capital, further fueled demand, while favorable
regulatory developments, such as a U.S. Senate stablecoin bill and
state-level crypto legislation, lent legitimacy to digital assets.
Analysts point to stablecoin flows, positive financial conditions, and
reduced speculative frenzy as signs that this rally rests on stronger
foundations than past highs. 

 SUI-BASED TOKEN PRICES PLUNGE AMID APPARENT CETUS PROTOCOL EXPLOIT (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sui-based tokens like LOFI, HIPPO, and CETUS dropped over 50% on DEXs
following an apparent exploit of Cetus Protocol, a leading DEX on Sui.
Analysts estimate over $200M was drained, with $60M USDC bridged to
Ethereum. The team has paused contracts and is investigating a
suspected oracle-related vulnerability.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GET PAID LIKE A LOCAL IN DOLLARS OR EUROS USING SLING (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Sling has launched virtual USD and EUR accounts tailored for
freelancers, remote workers, and digital nomads, enabling seamless
cross-border payments without needing to explain stablecoins or
crypto. Users can receive payments like a local, then send funds to
140+ countries or withdraw via debit cards, mobile money, or Solana
exchanges. 

 THE SUCCINCT NETWORK AND THE $PROVE TOKEN (27 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Succinct's protocol coordinates a decentralized marketplace where
provers bid off-chain via an auctioneer service and smart contracts
settle proofs and state roots as a verifiable application (vApp). The
PROVE token powers payments, network security through staking and
delegation, and governance, distributing fees and emissions to
incentivize competitive proof provision. By separating real-time
execution from on-chain settlement, the architecture delivers
web-scale performance with crypto-grade verifiability and secure fund
custody. Stage 2.5 of the testnet will launch end-to-end proof
requests and fulfillment, opening participation to rollups, L1
blockchains, games, and other applications.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MODULAR CAPITAL PENDLE THESIS (25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Pendle is the leading marketplace for trading yield on stablecoins.
It captures over 30% of the growing $11 billion yield-bearing
stablecoin market with $4 billion in TVL, $50 billion in lifetime
volume, and $35-40 million in annualized fees. Favorable regulatory
shifts are driving a projected doubling of total stablecoin supply to
$500 billion and a rise in yield-bearing issuance to $75 billion over
the next 18-24 months. Pendle's two-pronged flywheel â€” airdrop
bootstrapping into a durable yield marketplace â€” has diversified its
stablecoin exposure from <20% to 83% of TVL. At 25% market share of
yield-bearing coins, Pendle could scale to $20 billion TVL and $200
million in protocol fees, implying a potential $6 billion valuation. 

 THE PRICE OF TRUST (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Debt's essence has always been trust, and loans should be priced by
openly auctioning trust assumptions like collateral, contracts, and
reputation. Standardizing and broadcasting these trust factors enables
competitive bidding across all counterparties, ensuring optimal terms.
Lending protocols must minimize their own trust impact through
immutable, verifiable infrastructure, leaving loan approval and
pricing to free markets. Morpho aims to embody this framework by
facilitating trust-priced lending across the full spectrum of
collateralized and undercollateralized scenarios.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STABLECOIN BILL COULD CREATE TRILLIONS IN DEMAND FOR TREASURYS (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 White House crypto czar David Sacks says the GENIUS Act could unlock
trillions of dollars in demand for U.S. Treasurys by providing legal
clarity for stablecoins, turning an already $200B market into a major
force for dollar demand. The bill, which advanced with bipartisan
support, mandates full Treasury/dollar-equivalent backing, AML
compliance, and oversight for large issuers like Tether and Circle.
While critics warn of potential conflicts tied to Trump's allies and
USD1, Sacks emphasized stablecoins' role in strengthening U.S. dollar
dominance and modernizing payments. 

 SONIC LABS AND GSR PARTNER (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Sonic Labs has partnered with crypto capital markets firm GSR to
provide deep liquidity, strategic guidance, and ecosystem support for
the S token and broader DeFi network. Beyond market making, GSR will
assist early-stage projects, deploy on-chain liquidity, and contribute
to Sonic's long-term development, reinforced by its sponsorship of
Sonic Summit 2025.

further bitcoin acquisitions and corporate expenses. 

 RABBY TO DISCONTINUE SUPPORT FOR FIREFOX BROWSER (2 MINUTE READ) [14]


 Rabby Wallet will no longer maintain its Firefox extension due to
poor hardware wallet support (e.g., Ledger) and a smaller user base,
opting to focus resources on Chrome and Brave where user experience
and reach are stronger.
