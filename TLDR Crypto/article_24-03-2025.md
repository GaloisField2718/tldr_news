GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE RISE OF RWA IN DEFI (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The real-world assets (RWA) sector is rapidly growing, having
recently reached an all-time high of $10.2 billion in TVL driven by
institutional participation and improved regulatory clarity. Recent
developments like Dubai's real estate tokenization initiative and
Ondo's partnership with Mastercard underscore growing institutional
engagement, which is further evidenced by the continuous growth of
BlackRock's onchain BUIDL fund. Investors see RWAs as a bridge between
traditional assets and DeFi enabling more stable markets with the
onchain benefits of transparency and composability. 

 THE APP-COIN THESIS: APPLICATIONS ARE GOING TO ZERO, IN A GOOD WAY…
(8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI-driven “vibe coding” is reducing app development costs
significantly, which threatens traditional SaaS companies lacking
strong moats. Tokenization and app-coins further lower barriers for
initial user acquisition through speculation, potentially sparking a
massive wave of app innovation and wealth creation accessible to
smaller developers and investors. Teams that excel at branding,
marketing, and culturally resonant positioning will thrive.

farming strategies that offer consistent APYs, as demonstrated by
recent delta-neutral approaches on platforms like Sonic and Berachain.
