MARKETS & BUSINESS

 INSTITUTIONS TRIM BTC WHILE SOLANA ETFS KEEP ABSORBING FLOWS (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 BlackRock's IBIT posted a record $523 million single-day outflow and
has now seen $1.43 billion pulled over five days and $2.19 billion
over four weeks, as institutions rebalance risk since bitcoin's slide
from a $126,080 ATH and ongoing Fed rate and liquidity uncertainty.
The selling drove a $372.7 million net outflow across all spot BTC
ETFs and similar redemptions from ETH products. Spot Solana ETFs have
quietly racked up 16 straight days of inflows totaling $420.4 million,
signaling allocators rotating toward higher-yielding altcoin exposure
rather than exiting crypto entirely. 

 KRAKEN CONFIDENTIALLY FILES FOR IPO (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Kraken confidentially filed for a US IPO following an $800 million
raise at $20 billion valuation, including $200 million from Citadel
Securities, with proceeds earmarked for international expansion and
payment services buildout. The 2011-founded exchange joins a wave of
crypto companies tapping public markets under the Trump administration
after Circle's $1 billion June IPO and Bullish and Gemini's listings
in August and September. Kraken declined to comment on IPO timing.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 HYPERLIQUID UNVEILS HIP-3 GROWTH MODE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hyperliquid launched HIP-3 growth mode, allowing permissionless
market deployment with taker fees slashed over 90% from 0.045% to
0.0045%-0.009%, potentially reaching 0.00144% for top-tier traders at
maximum staking and volume tiers. Deployers must set fee scales
between 0-1 and avoid overlap with existing validator-operated
perpetuals to prevent parasitic volume, with growth mode locking for
30 days once activated to ensure market stability. The upgrade aims to
deepen liquidity and broaden asset offerings by lowering barriers to
entry for exotic markets, including real-world yields, commodities,
and tokenized treasuries, though HYPE token fell 6% below $40. 

 COINBASE APP CODE APPEARS TO INCLUDE PREDICTION MARKETS AND STOCKS (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Coinbase's mobile app code contains interfaces for prediction markets
and tokenized stock trading discovered through reverse-engineering by
researcher Jane Manchun Wong, with fine print indicating "Prediction
markets are offered by Coinbase Financial Markets through KalshiEX
LLC" pointing to a Kalshi integration. The features align with
Coinbase's July "everything exchange" strategy announcement and the
company's December 17 "System Update" event promising new product
launches.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW SLASH WENT FROM $2M TO $150M ARR IN 24 MONTHS (7 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Slash, a business banking startup, scaled profitably from $2 million
to $150 million in annualized revenue in two years by attacking
“tiny” niches first (starting with a credit card for sneaker
resellers), treating revenue as the only metric that truly matters,
and ignoring fears of “market saturation” in a fintech space still
dominated by legacy banks. Early-stage founders should do everything
themselves instead of outsourcing, then rapidly pivot to hiring
“killers” once past ~$10M ARR. Slash's success is the result of an
unusually intense, highly technical team that ships fast across
treasury, stablecoin payments, global USD, and more.

 YIELD-BEARING STABLECOIN LANDSCAPE (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The GENIUS Act bifurcates stablecoins into non-yielding Payment
Stablecoins and Yield-Bearing Stablecoins (YBS). The YBS label masks
fundamentally different risk profiles across three categories:
RWA-backed assets like Ondo importing T-bill yields with counterparty
risk, onchain native protocols like Ethena's sUSDe generating
delta-neutral returns with smart contract and funding rate risk, and
actively managed strategies like Maple Finance introducing human
underwriting risk. Hyperliquid's USDH exemplifies innovative value
capture by keeping the stablecoin non-yielding while directing 95-100%
of RWA reserve yields back to the protocol ecosystem, circumventing
regulatory restrictions. Current market analysis relying on TVL and
APY comparisons fails to capture these disparate qualitative risk
vectors. 

 STABLES ARE NOT STABLE (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Stream Finance's collapse in November exposed recursive lending fraud
where $1.9 million USDC collateral backed $14.5 million xUSD through
systematic fractional reserve expansion, triggering $93 million direct
losses and $285 million cross-protocol contagion. The circular
dependency with Elixir's deUSD amplified the cascade, with Stream
holding 90% of deUSD supply while Elixir concentrated 65% of reserves
in loans to Stream via private Morpho vaults, causing deUSD to
collapse 98%. Contagion spread to TelosC with $123.64 million
exposure, MEV Capital with $25.42 million, and Euler with $137 million
bad debt, while yield-bearing stablecoins lost 40-50% TVL
industry-wide despite maintaining pegs as users fled indiscriminately.
DeFi's fundamental pattern of unsustainable yields, circular
dependencies, and oracle failures remains structurally unchanged
across five years of documented failures.
