MARKETS & BUSINESS

 VANECK REGISTERS ENTITY FOR POTENTIAL FIRST BNB ETF (1 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 VanEck has allegedly registered an entity in Delaware for a spot BNB
ETF, indicating that the firm is progressing toward launching the fund
in the U.S. This filing suggests VanEck is expanding its footprint in
the crypto ETF space as institutional interest in digital assets
grows. However, fake filings have been made in the past. Official
confirmation of the report is still pending. 

 FIRST DIGITAL TRUST DECLARES INSOLVENCY (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 First Digital Trust (FDT) is insolvent and unable to fulfill client
fund redemptions, posing serious risks to users. Justin Sun has urged
for immediate action to secure assets and calls on Hong Kong
regulators and law enforcement to close loopholes in trust licensing
and risk management to safeguard the region's financial reputation.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ACCTUAL INTRODUCES INTEREST-BEARING INVOICES (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Acctual has introduced a new feature that allows businesses to issue
interest-bearing invoices, enabling them to charge clients interest
for late payments. This is a global solution that accrues interest
every second, charging up to 500% for payment delays and operating in
over 130 countries to help businesses get paid faster. 

 JAPAN'S SECOND-LARGEST BANK SMBC EYES STABLECOIN LAUNCH WITH AVA LABS
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Japan's second-largest bank, SMBC, is exploring a stablecoin launch

regulatory landscapes.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BETWEEN EXTREMES: A DEFI-NATIVE BLUEPRINT FOR SUSTAINABLE TGES (11
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Traditional TGE models, where low float/high FDV or fair launches,
struggle to foster sustainable market structures due to opaque price
discovery, liquidity challenges, and misaligned incentives. A
DeFi-Native TGE blueprint integrates onchain liquidity with phased
liquidity provision, price-based incremental unlocks, and smart
contract-based controls on the supply. It aims to convert sell
pressure into structured market depth and align insiders, teams, and
new investors for long-term growth and sustainability. 

 SOLANA STABLECOIN REPORT (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Stablecoins, with over $200B in circulating supply and trillions in
annual transaction volume, are revolutionizing global payments by
enabling transactions at costs below $0.001 with settlement times as
fast as 0.4 seconds. Solana has high throughput, minimal fees, and
innovative features like token extensions and permissioned
environments, which together are driving widespread adoption and
financial inclusion.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A TOKEN WON'T SAVE YOU (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Token launches are a double-edged sword. While they drive economic
activity and growth if a protocol demonstrates strong product-market
fit, they can also tarnish a project's reputation if it underperforms.
Tokens should amplify genuine, revenue-generating products rather than
serve as a shortcut to quick liquidity and attention, as a down-only
token will impede adoption. Coordinated launches are particularly
important for ecosystems to avoid splitting demand and diluting market
impact. They should be profitable and sustainable, rather than relying
on speculative community capital. 

 CROSSCHAIN: ONE WORD, ONE ETHEREUM (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Ethereum community will now be using “crosschain” as one word
to signal a cultural move toward a more unified, interoperable
ecosystem. It underscores a broader effort to eliminate fragmentation
and streamline intent-based transactions across rollups. ERC-7683,
developed by Across and Uniswap, allows for trust-minimized
interactions and will play a pivotal role in future interoperability
developments.
