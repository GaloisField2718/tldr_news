MARKETS & BUSINESS

 MEMECOINS LEAD CRYPTO MARKET GAINS (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin remains range-bound below $70,000 while speculative assets
drive market gains, with the AI tokens leading the sector. Derivatives
markets show deep deleveraging with BTC futures open interest dropping
to $15.9B and funding rates hitting aggressive negative territory on
major exchanges (Binance -7%, Bybit -8%), though options data suggests
institutional bottom-fishing with call dominance rebounding to 56%. 

 GENIUS ACT AND MICA WILL SPLIT STABLECOINS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The GENIUS Act and MiCA are creating a bifurcated stablecoin market
between Tier-1 "constitutional cash" tokens with strict redemption
rights, liquid reserves, and no-yield provisions designed to prevent
bank-like runs, and Tier-2 "synthetic cash" products that behave like
money in calm markets but reprice as risk assets during redemption
stress. MiCA reserves the authority to throttle stablecoins that
achieve excessive payment ubiquity as a financial stability measure,
while GENIUS explicitly bans yield to prevent digital dollars from
mimicking uninsured deposits. The most critical unresolved
vulnerability is cross-border "multi-issuance" structures where single
stablecoin brands are issued by multiple legal entities across
jurisdictions, creating concentration risk if global redemption runs
overwhelm the jurisdiction with the strongest legal rights.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 LEDGER INTEGRATES OKX DEX FOR IN-WALLET, SELF-CUSTODIAL SWAPS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ledger Wallet will integrate OKX DEX, allowing users to swap tokens
directly onchain while retaining full self-custody and signing every
transaction with a Ledger hardware device. The move expands Ledger's
in-wallet DeFi stack with cross-chain swaps across major networks,
pairing OKX's aggregated liquidity with hardware-enforced security to
meet growing demand for autonomous yet secure trading. 

 THE ZKEVM IS THE NEW 'MERGE' (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 zkEVM is Ethereum's new unifying narrative. It should replace the
rollup-centric roadmap now that zkEVM technology has progressed faster
than anticipated. The zkEVM would enable Ethereum's L1 to accept
validity proofs of EVM execution rather than re-executing blocks,
delivering an order-of-magnitude scalability improvement with low fees
and fast transactions directly on mainnet. Unlike previous technical
upgrades, this would directly address user experience by bringing
massive scalability to L1 itself rather than pushing activity to L2s.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ETHEREUM'S NEAR-TERM ROLE IN AN AI-DRIVEN WORLD (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Vitalik Buterin argues Ethereum's value in an AI-heavy future is not
chasing AGI, but enabling privacy-preserving, decentralized
coordination between humans and AI through trustless interaction,
onchain economic mechanisms for agents, and AI-assisted governance and
markets. He frames this as “defensive acceleration”, using tools
like local LLMs, cryptographic payments, zero-knowledge proofs, and
prediction markets to strengthen human agency and decentralized
decision-making rather than concentrating power. 

 THE AGENTIC ECOSYSTEM ON BASE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Base is positioned as the primary infrastructure layer for autonomous
AI agents, leveraging x402 micropayments alongside deep USDC liquidity
and Coinbase's infrastructure integration. The technical stack
combines x402 for HTTP-native payments, CDP SDKs for wallet
operations, XMTP for agent-to-agent messaging, and emerging identity
frameworks to enable machine-to-machine commerce. There is structural
fit rather than speculative appeal — autonomous systems require
predictable execution costs and reliable capital access, making Base's
low-fee environment and stablecoin infrastructure more important than
high-upside tokenomics.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ENSV2 TO DEPLOY ON ETHEREUM L1, NAMECHAIN CANCELLED (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 ENS announced ENSv2 will deploy exclusively on Ethereum L1, canceling
plans for Namechain L2 while maintaining its product roadmap,
including per-name registries and expanded customization. The protocol
will enable one-click .eth registration from any EVM chain without
bridging, alongside continued non-EVM support for Solana and Bitcoin.
Vitalik Buterin has endorsed the decision, arguing that ENS represents
central Ethereum ecosystem state functioning as a semi-financial
application where L1 placement maximizes accessibility and aligns with
an optimal decentralized identity architecture that keeps core
account/profile data on mainnet while routing user actions to
specialized L2s. 

 EUROPE'S $24T BREAKUP WITH VISA AND MASTERCARD HAS BEGUN (5 MINUTE
READ) [11]

launch Wero, a digital payment network serving 130 million users
across 13 countries. Utilizing SEPA instant transfers, the project
seeks to establish European strategic autonomy and reduce reliance on
US-based infrastructure like Visa and Mastercard.
