 üÜï GROW YOUR BITCOIN HOLDINGS WITH EVERVALUE'S NEW EVA TOKEN
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 There's a new way to increase the amount of Bitcoin you hold‚Ä¶

On September 23, EverValue is introducing the EVA token [4], a new
Bitcoin-backed cryptocurrency that allows investors to grow their
Bitcoin holdings over time. Unlike other projects that require staking
or locking tokens, EVA stays in the investor's wallet, with
appreciation happening passively.

The EVA token is secured by the Burn Vault [4], a smart contract
audited by Hacken. It's designed to be whale-proof and to appreciate
against Bitcoin. The increase in value comes from the continuous
addition of Bitcoin from EverValue's mining operations, while the
token supply is capped at 21 million and can only decrease through
token burns.

The tokens will never be worth less than the Burn Price, which is
calculated by dividing the amount of Bitcoin in the Burn Vault by the
total supply. Since the supply decreases and the Bitcoin backing
increases, the Burn Price is mathematically guaranteed to rise.

CHARTERED SAYS (2 MINUTE READ) [5]

 TEXAS COURT DISMISSES CONSENSYS LAWSUIT AGAINST SEC (1 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The lawsuit from blockchain infrastructure company Consensys against
the SEC has been dismissed. It was filed in April, with Consensys
accusing the SEC of opening an investigation into Ethereum and issuing
Consensys a Wells' Notice over MetaMask's Swap feature. The SEC's
investigation into Ethereum was dismissed as moot - the SEC previously
announced this summer it had dropped any investigation into the asset.

 WHAT CREDIT CARD NETWORKS CAN TEACH US ABOUT STABLECOIN OPPORTUNITIES
(6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Just like how each stablecoin has unique characteristics based on its
issuer, credit cards use dollars that are almost identical, but are
different based on their network and issuing bank. Stablecoin payment
flows will likely involve an orchestration service that transfers
buyers' stablecoins to sellers' preferred assets, providing
significant benefits in cross-border transactions thanks to lower fees
and instant settlement.
