MARKETS & BUSINESS

 MORGAN STANLEY FILES FOR BITCOIN AND SOLANA ETFS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Morgan Stanley filed with the SEC for a spot Bitcoin ETF and Solana
trust – a strategic shift from distributing third-party crypto
products to creating in-house vehicles as institutional demand
accelerates. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have grown to $123 billion in total net
assets (6.57% of BTC's market cap) with $1.1 billion in net inflows
year-to-date, while Solana trusts have surpassed $1 billion in assets
following nearly $800 million in cumulative inflows. The ETF business
economics are lucrative – BlackRock's Bitcoin ETFs became the firm's
top revenue source in November with nearly $100 billion in allocations
– and Morgan Stanley's ability to vertically integrate these
products through its massive wealth management arm, which opened
crypto access to clients in October, keeps management fees in-house
rather than paying competitors. 

 ETHEREUM NETWORK USAGE HITS RECORD HIGH (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ethereum's 7-day average of daily transactions reached a record 2.023
million on January 4, driven primarily by accelerating real-world
asset tokenization adoption, yet prediction market data reveal traders
assign higher odds to gold hitting $5,000 than Ethereum reaching
$4,000. Despite the network usage milestone, ETH is trading at $3,240,
with analysts attributing the sentiment disconnect to short-term macro
uncertainty and liquidity conditions outweighing on-chain fundamentals
in price discovery. Analysts argue this represents a temporary
divergence, noting that Ethereum's long-term investment case remains
anchored in its DeFi and tokenized asset dominance and suggests that
increasing ETH absorption into RWAs and DeFi protocols will tighten
effective supply and support more durable price appreciation.
Prediction markets show 58% odds for ETH hitting $4,000 versus falling
to $2,500, up from 43% at the start of the year, indicating some
improving sentiment despite the current lag behind gold.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 G*BOY: THE FASTEST-GROWING IP IN CRYPTO (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 G*BOY's "Animate” is a tool that allows community members to
convert static images into high-fidelity videos in seconds. It builds
on the project's AI toolkit, which has already generated over 130,000
character-consistent assets, with the community now producing 90% of
the brand's visual output. Web3 IP is broken because projects treat
supporters as passive consumers rather than empowering them with the
same creation tools as core teams. G*BOY is positioned as a
community-proliferated franchise where token holders own stake in a
democratized IP that can compete with billion-dollar media companies
for attention on platforms like X and TikTok. The launch bets on
video's dominance in the attention economy while embracing community
taste rather than fearing supporters will "mess up" the IP as
traditional brands do. 

 XRPL'S MPT MAKES TOKENIZATION PRODUCTION-READY (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The XRPL Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard embeds institutional
controls at the protocol layer (rich metadata, issuer-defined
permissions, KYC/AML authorizations, transfer restrictions, freezing,
and clawbacks) to deliver deterministic settlement, low fees, and fast
finality. This enables compliant stablecoins, tokenized MMFs, RWAs,
escrowed collateral, and closed-loop loyalty systems as
production-grade financial infrastructure rather than experimental
smart-contract pilots.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 TRANSPARENCY WHEN YOU WANT, PRIVACY WHEN YOU NEED IT (SPONSOR) [8] 

 The transparency of traditional blockchains forces a difficult
choice: utility or privacy. Midnight [8] empowers innovators to break
free from this limitation, to a place where privacy is not just a
feature, but foundational.

PRIVACY MATTERS. BREAK FREE WITH MIDNIGHT [8]

 ETHEREUM'S INSTITUTIONAL MOMENT HEADS INTO 2026 (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethereum has exited the experimentation phase and is becoming the
default blockchain for institutional tokenization, stablecoins, and
custom Layer 2 deployments, driven by regulatory clarity, proven
uptime, and deep liquidity. Major banks and asset managers, including
JPMorgan, BlackRock, Fidelity, and BNY Mellon, are already issuing
tokenized funds and financial products on Ethereum, while stablecoins
and L2s position it as core financial infrastructure. Looking ahead to
2026, tokenized assets, stablecoins, and ETH's price are forecasted to
grow 5x as Ethereum solidifies its role as “digital oil” and an
institutional-grade treasury asset. 

 AAVE V4: A FAIRER LENDING MODEL WITH RISK PREMIUM (7 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Aave V4 overhauls lending by adding a “Risk Premium” that prices
borrowing costs based on the quality of a user's collateral, fixing a
long-standing issue where risky and safe borrowers paid the same rates
in shared liquidity pools. The protocol assigns risk scores to
collateral, computes a position-level risk premium using only the
collateral actually needed to back the debt, and accrues that extra
cost gradually through interest rather than upfront fees. This design
makes borrowing fairer, improves capital efficiency in Aave's new
unified liquidity architecture, and aligns interest rates more closely
with the real risk each position introduces to the system.

 CIRCLE'S USDC OUTPACES GROWTH OF TETHER'S USDT (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Circle's USDC stablecoin grew 73% to $75.12 billion in 2025,
significantly outpacing Tether's USDT growth of 36% to $186.6 billion
for the second consecutive year, driven by increasing institutional
demand for regulated digital dollars following the passage of the
GENUIS Act. USDC's regulatory compliance – including state money
transmission licenses, New York virtual currency licensing, and MiCA
framework adherence in Europe – has made it the preferred choice for
institutions like Visa, Mastercard, and BlackRock, while USDT remains
unregulated in the US and Europe. Despite USDC's faster growth
trajectory, the two stablecoins still command over 80% of the $312
billion total stablecoin market, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent
projecting the sector could reach $3.7 trillion by decade's end.
JPMorgan analysts noted that USDC's transparent reserve management and
regular audits make it more trustworthy among institutional investors
and regulated entities compared to competitors. 

 STABLECOIN “INTERCHANGE” IS A CATEGORY ERROR (5 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Proposals to limit stablecoin rewards to merchant transactions
misunderstand stablecoins by treating them like credit cards, even
though their economics are driven by yield on reserves, not
transaction fees. Restricting rewards to spending would effectively
tax holders by forcing them to transact just to access value generated
by their own balances, while funneling yield to intermediaries. Such a
policy would undermine the GENIUS Act's pro-innovation intent, push
users and businesses offshore, and weaken US leadership in stablecoins
by ignoring how the technology actually creates value.
