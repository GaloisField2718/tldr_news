OF 2026 (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Kraken is considering an IPO as soon as Q1 2026, having previously
explored a pre-IPO raise of over $100M in 2024. It now joins other
crypto firms eyeing public listings under a more crypto-friendly
regulatory environment, following the SEC's recent decision to drop
its case against Kraken. 

 TOP US BANKING REGULATOR RESCINDS PREVIOUS DIGITAL ASSET RESTRICTIONS
AMID TRUMP'S PUSH TO END CRYPTO DEBANKING (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has retracted
previous restrictions on digital asset activities, clarifying that
banks may now engage in crypto custody, stablecoin operations, and
node verification, which eases the regulatory burden on banks. This
move aligns with President Trump's push to end crypto debanking,

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING MTNCAPITAL, A FUTARCHY DAO ON SOLANA (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Solana startup coworking space mtndao will launch its new token,
$MTN, through MetaDAO around the end of March. It will be governed as
a futarchy – a model where all key decisions are decided fully
onchain. As the first DAO to debut on MetaDAO, mtnCapital aims to
align closely with community-driven governance and set a new benchmark
for decentralized organizational autonomy onchain. 

 REINTRODUCTION TO ELIZAOS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 elizaOS 2.0 is a decentralized operating system purpose-built for AI
agents, designed to autonomously manage crypto assets, coordinate
DAOs, and drive decentralized economic networks. Central to elizaOS is
the Eliza framework, a Typescript-based AI toolkit that rose to
prominence in prior months as the top trending Github repo. The
elizaOS ecosystem includes initiatives like AI-enhanced governance for
DAOs, the Global Trust Marketplace for decentralized trading
intelligence, and an AI-powered token launchpad.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 SEPOLIA PECTRA FORK INCIDENT RECAP (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Sepolia Pectra hardfork encountered an issue where the deposit
contract's token-gated mechanics triggered unexpected events, causing
nodes to mine empty blocks. A coordinated fix was deployed, first
privately to restore functionality, then publicly at 14:00 UTC,
successfully resolving the issue without losing finalization. 

 HYPEREVM (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 HyperEVM, built on Hyperliquid's high-performance L1, integrates EVM
compatibility with native liquidity, near-instant finality (~0.2 sec),
and an efficient dual-block architecture. Despite strong early
adoption and deflationary tokenomics, challenges remain in attracting
top developers and expanding beyond perpetual and spot DEX offerings.

 NOTHING EVER HAPPENS - BITCOIN AND MARKET MUSINGS (7 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 The narrative around a government-driven strategic reserve has faded
a mere week after it was hyped by President Trump on social media.
Bitcoin price action remains uncertain, characterized by immediate
retracements after rallies and positioned in a “void” between
significant volume ranges, indicating weak market strength. Open
interest continues to trend downward despite recent price increases,
suggesting limited directional leverage and potential vulnerability to
further downside. External factors, including volatility in equity
markets driven by tariff news, continue to suppress optimism for a
sustained rally. 

 THE SECRET SAUCE OF HYPERLIQUID (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Hyperliquid has rapidly become a dominant force in decentralized
perpetuals trading, capturing an unprecedented 64.71% share of total
onchain perps volume with CEX-like speed, liquidity, and UX. Unlike
many DEX competitors, Hyperliquid's custom blockchain enables
sub-second transaction finality, 100k orders per second, and
composable DeFi features. This performance is enhanced by
community-centric development, including products like liquidity
vaults, spot markets featuring major assets, and user-driven
improvements, ensuring alignment with traders over short-term
investors.
