MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE EYES TOKENIZED SECURITIES AS CRYPTO REGULATIONS SHIFT UNDER
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Coinbase is revisiting its goal to introduce tokenized securities to
the U.S. market given the apparent regulatory shift under the Trump
administration, which now appears more supportive of crypto
innovation. With the SEC's crypto task force in place, Coinbase sees
an opportunity to revive its earlier efforts to launch security tokens
and improve traditional asset trading on-chain. 

 ETHEREUM DEVS ACTIVATE PECTRA UPGRADE ON SEPOLIA TESTNET IN LAST
PHASE BEFORE MAINNET ROLLOUT (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ethereum's Pectra upgrade has been activated on the Sepolia testnet,
marking the final major test phase before its planned mainnet launch
next month. The upgrade introduces improvements to scalability,
security, and usability, including an improved wallet experience (less
wallet approvals), account abstraction, and increased validator stake
limits.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 NEXUS TESTNET II RECAP: BUILDING THE LAYER 1 SUPERCOMPUTER (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Nexus has completed its second testnet for its upcoming blockchain,
demonstrating scale with 2.1 million unique users and 3.6 million
total nodes over a 4.5-day period. The testnet integrated blockchain
functionality with its distributed supercomputer network. Nexus is
working toward its vision of a “Verifiable Internet” powered by
its zkVM, with the platform now transitioning to devnet mode for
continued development. 

 CORK: THE TOKENIZED RISK PRIMITIVE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cork Protocol has launched its public beta on Ethereum Mainnet,
introducing a new DeFi primitive for pricing, hedging, and trading
risk in the $30B onchain credit market. Depeg Swaps are a new asset
class allowing users to price and hedge against depeg events in
stablecoins and liquid staking tokens. The beta features capped
liquidity vaults for the next 3-6 months, aiming to enable risk-free
leveraged farming strategies and prevent systemic risks like Terra.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ARE STABLECOINS A NEW FINANCIAL SYSTEM OR WILL THEY BE REPLACED? (17
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stablecoins account for two-thirds of all onchain transactions and
are increasingly growing with institutional and retail interest alike.
Initially popularized by Tether for arbitrage, they've grown into a
fast, low-cost alternative for transfers, payments, and yield
generation, outpacing traditional wires and processors like Western
Union. In regions plagued by capital controls and inefficient banking,
stablecoins offer financial freedom and the potential to transform
global money movement. 

 FRANKLIN TEMPLETON: SOLANA VS ETHEREUM DEFI (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Solana's DEX volume surpassed all EVM DEX volumes for the first time
in January 2025. Despite this achievement and higher growth profiles,
Solana DeFi continues to trade at lower valuation multiples compared
to Ethereum counterparts, potentially presenting a market asymmetry.
This shift, combined with Solana's milestone of one year without
outages and the migration of Ethereum activity to Layer 2s, suggests a
potential transition from EVM to SVM dominance in DeFi, while also
validating Ethereum's modular scaling approach.

 WALLET-CENTRISM (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 As crypto moves toward AI agents as the primary point of interaction,
users will increasingly delegate complex tasks to their agents,
requiring a secure and universal way to manage identity and
permissions. Self-custody wallets will become the primary interface
for both onchain and offchain activities, serving as a
cryptographically-secure “autonomous extension” of users that can
generate attestations and manage permissions on their behalf. 

 ETHENA LABS IS NOW A TOP 5 DEFI PROTOCOL BY TVL, EARNING $300M+ IN

 Ethena Labs has become a top 5 DeFi protocol by TVL, generating over
$300M in revenue, leading to the approval of a fee switch proposal by
its Risk Committee. The activation of this fee switch depends on
meeting key success and risk metrics, ensuring sustainable revenue
distribution to ENA stakers.
