MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FIDELITY LAUNCHES TOKENIZED TREASURY FUND ON ETHEREUM (6 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Fidelity has quietly launched the Fidelity Digital Interest Token
(FDIT) on Ethereum, a tokenized version of its Treasury money market
fund that has already accumulated over $200 million in assets since
beginning operations in August. The move puts Fidelity in direct
competition with BlackRock's BUIDL fund, which dominates the tokenized
Treasury market with over $2 billion in assets under management, as
part of a broader $7 billion tokenized Treasury ecosystem that
includes offerings from Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Despite
currently having only two holders, FDIT marks another major
traditional finance player adopting blockchain infrastructure to
improve market efficiency, reduce settlement times, and cut costs.
McKinsey analysts project that tokenized securities could reach $2
trillion in market value by the end of the decade. 

 COULD A DOGECOIN ETF BE LAUNCHED THIS WEEK? (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF ($DOJE) is expected to launch this week,
becoming the first U.S. exchange-traded fund to provide direct
exposure to Dogecoin's price movements. The ETF is backed by REX
Shares and Osprey Funds, the same firms behind the Solana staking ETF
that launched earlier this year, and represents the latest expansion
of crypto ETF offerings following the approval of spot Bitcoin and
Ethereum products in 2024. DOGE has rallied 7% in the past 24 hours
and 15% over the week in anticipation of the launch, outperforming
major cryptocurrencies as market participants expect increased
volatility and potential speculative inflows. The launch comes amid a
broader race among issuers to create ETF products tied to alternative
cryptocurrencies, with Canary Capital also recently filing for a TRUMP
coin ETF in late August.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 NATIVE USDC AND CCTP V2 COMING TO HYPERLIQUID (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Circle announced that native USDC and its upgraded Cross-Chain
Transfer Protocol (CCTP V2) will soon be live on Hyperliquid's
HyperEVM. This integration enables direct USDC deposits into
HyperCore, institutional-grade on/offramps via Circle Mint, and
seamless use across HyperEVM apps. With CCTP V2, developers can build
efficient crosschain apps for swaps, treasury rebalancing, and
onboarding, positioning USDC as a key settlement asset for
Hyperliquid's trading and DeFi ecosystem. 

 ETHEREALIZE'S NEXT CHAPTER (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Etherealize is building institutional-grade infrastructure on
Ethereum, including zero-knowledge privacy tools, settlement engines,
and tokenized fixed income applications. The company was co-founded by
former Ethereum Foundation research lead Danny Ryan and Wall Street
veteran Vivek Raman, with a team combining Ethereum core developers
and executives from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and other major financial
institutions. Since launching in January, Etherealize has engaged with
hundreds of banks and asset managers, collaborated on bringing new
tokenized assets onchain, and testified before Congress on digital
asset regulation. There is growing institutional momentum around
Ethereum, which now processes 95% of stablecoin volume and 82% of
tokenized real-world assets, positioning it as the dominant platform
for institutional blockchain adoption.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE BIDDING WAR FOR USDH ON HYPERLIQUID (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hyperliquid's upcoming native stablecoin, USDH, has drawn competing
proposals from Paxos, Frax, and Agora, each offering different
approaches to compliance, yield sharing, and ecosystem integration.
Paxos leans on regulatory clarity and institutional bridges like
PayPal, and Frax emphasizes zero-fee DeFi-native efficiency with
frxUSD backing, while Agora pledges 100% net revenue sharing through a
coalition model with partners like Rain and LayerZero. The outcome,
chosen by validator vote, will shape how Hyperliquid transitions away
from its current heavy reliance on USDC. 

 HYPERLIQUID: THE BLOCKCHAIN TO HOUSE ALL FINANCE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hyperliquid isn't just the largest decentralized perp exchange, it's
building the foundation to house all of finance. Legacy banking runs
on outdated 40+ year-old tech stacks like COBOL, leaving institutions
fragmented and opaque. Hyperliquid instead offers a unified chain with
deep liquidity, builder incentives, and HIP-3 permissionless markets.
With 279+ projects already building via Builder Codes, a forthcoming
native stablecoin (USDH), on/off-ramps, and gasless transfers,
Hyperliquid could become the global settlement layer for everything
from spot trading to payments, positioning $HYPE as core
infrastructure for the next trillion-dollar opportunity.

MISCELLANEOUS

 USDH STABLECOIN CUSTODIAN SCRUTINY (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Bridge's reliance on a small regional bank (with a <$2B balance
sheet) is a scaling risk for Hyperliquid's planned USDH stablecoin.
With $5B already in USDC deposits on Hyperliquid, custodians need
GSIB-level infrastructure (e.g., State Street with $49T assets) to
support growth. Smaller banks face regulatory limits when deposits
expand too quickly, which can halt scaling and damage customer
confidence. 

 TEMPO'S ARGUMENT FOR L1 FINALITY (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Tempo should be a standalone L1, not an Ethereum L2, because
real-world payments require sub-second finality that Ethereum (15m)
and Bitcoin (60m) can't provide. Since most rollups inherit Ethereum's
long finality window, they aren't viable for physical goods or
services that can't be reversed. By contrast, self-settled rollups
(like those built with Sovereign SDK on Celestia) already hit ~6s
finality and are expected to drop to ~300ms, making them better suited
for payment rails.
