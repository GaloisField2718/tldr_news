 THE HIDDEN COST OF HYPERLIQUID — AND HOW TO SKIP IT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You've done the research. You've got your thesis. But before you even
place a trade on Hyperliquid, you've already lost money — slippage
on the swap, bridge fees, gas on multiple chains.

Skip the death by a thousand cuts with Across Protocol [5] - and move
USDC directly into USDH on Hyperliquid for free.

✅ 1 USDC = 1 USDH — zero slippage, zero fees

✅ No bridge fees. (Only origin chain gas)

✅ Single transaction — no swaps, no extra steps

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 ETHEREUM FOUNDATION RESEARCHERS WARN OF STORAGE BURDEN (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Ethereum's state only grows. It is getting harder and more expensive
for nodes to store, serve, and sync. Centralization is a risk if only
large operators can run full infra. There are three potential initial
directions: State Expiry (prune inactive state with proof-based
revival), State Archive (separate hot vs. cold state so node
performance stays stable), and Partial Statelessness (nodes hold
subsets while clients/wallets cache what they need). 

 BITCOIN'S 'REALIZED CAP' HOLDS AT RECORD HIGH OVER $1 TRILLION (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bitcoin's realized cap hit a record $1.125 trillion and continued
rising through the 36% correction from October's all-time high,
valuing each bitcoin at its last-moved price to show actual capital
inflows rather than speculative market cap. The metric's resilience
contrasts with 2022's bear market, when realized cap fell from $470
billion to $385 billion during capitulation, with a similar pause
during April 2025's tariff tantrum preceding new highs. Bitcoin
materially underprices the supportive macro backdrop of resilient
global growth, ongoing rate cuts, and steepening yield curves that
weaken the dollar, casting doubt on the four-year cycle narrative with
potential 2026 upside.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SOFI UNVEILS ETHEREUM STABLECOIN FOR TRADING AND PAYMENTS (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 SoFi Bank's SoFiUSD is a stablecoin debuting on Ethereum positioned
as “bank-grade” and aimed at both SoFi's crypto trading flows,
payments, and remittances. SoFi hopes to share yield with holders and
partners and expand to multiple chains over time, plus offer
white-labeled stablecoin infrastructure for other companies.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHO OWNS 'AAVE': AAVE LABS VS AAVE DAO (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Aave Labs replaced Paraswap with CowSwap on the Aave website,
redirecting 15-25 bps swap fees from DAO treasury to Labs-controlled
addresses, leading to an estimated $10 million in annual DAO losses as
the protocol-versus-product boundary collapsed. Aave Labs may have a
fiduciary duty since the Aave brand was economically paid for through
DAO governance, risk absorption, and treasury spending over years,
while Labs claims the frontend operation sits outside protocol
governance and monetization is justified. The tension escalated with
Horizon generating $100k revenue versus $500k DAO incentives plus GHO
opportunity costs, Labs bypassing ACI's MegaETH proposal to secure 30
million points directly, and ERC-4626 Aave Vaults positioning
Labs-owned products as default Aave V4 UX, capturing fees built on DAO
reputation. 

 COINBASE SUES STATES OVER PREDICTION MARKETS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coinbase filed preemptive lawsuits against Michigan, Illinois, and
Connecticut regulators, challenging their authority to classify
prediction markets as unlicensed gambling, arguing they're
CFTC-regulated financial derivatives protected by federal preemption
over state gambling statutes, mirroring Kalshi's successful legal
framework. The cases will determine whether platforms face fragmented
state-by-state licensing regimes or nationwide federal oversight,
enabling Coinbase's "universal exchange" strategy expanding beyond
spot crypto into derivatives, tokenized assets, and prediction
markets.

MISCELLANEOUS

 COINBASE SHOULD BE MOVED TO THE TOP OF NEO BANK LIST (2 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Coinbase now looks more like a top “neobank” because its latest
rollout adds agent-to-agent (A2A) payments and an AI financial
advisor, which could materially improve revenue-per-employee and
operating leverage versus TradFi. It also claims Coinbase's x402
positioning + deep issuer partnerships (e.g., Circle planning for
“billions of agents” over 3–5 years) could put Coinbase/Base in
the path of trillions of agentic transactions. 

 JPMORGAN'S TOKENIZED DOLLARS ARE REWIRING HOW WALL STREET MOVES MONEY
(6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 JPMorgan moved its JPM Coin deposit token (“JPMD”) from its
permissioned Ethereum setup on Kinexys onto Coinbase's Base, saying
institutions want a bank-deposit “cash equivalent” on public
chains where the main option today is stablecoins. The near-term use
case is collateral plus margin payments tied to crypto trading (e.g.,
clients posting collateral at Coinbase), with JPM emphasizing
permissioning/whitelisting and strong controls (it controls the smart
contract and keys).
