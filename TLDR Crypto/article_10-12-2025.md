USDC from any of 20+ chains directly into USDH on Hyperliquid or
HyperEVM.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 US CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE TALKS STALL IN SENATE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The House has already passed the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act,
but the Senate is juggling competing drafts from the Banking and
Agriculture Committees that must reconcile SEC/CFTC jurisdiction,
define “ancillary assets,” and set guardrails for DeFi and
stablecoin yield. Hopes for a pre-Christmas markup are fading, with
some senators citing timeline and White House concerns over ethics and
quorum language, plus political noise around President Trump's
extensive crypto holdings. Although a stablecoin law is on the books,
broader rules for exchanges, tokens, and DeFi are still stuck in
committee drama. 

 SEC APPROVES US' SECOND CRYPTO INDEX ETP (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund received SEC approval to trade on
NYSE Arca as the second US-listed multi-asset crypto ETP following
Grayscale's July approval, offering diversified exposure to the 10
largest cryptocurrencies rebalanced monthly. The $1.25 billion fund
originally launched in 2020 as an OTC fund. It now joins the regulated
structure used by gold, oil, and commodity funds, potentially easing
operational risks for traditional allocators wary of direct token
exposure.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PNC ROLLS OUT DIRECT BITCOIN TRADING FOR HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 PNC Bank launched direct spot bitcoin trading for private bank
clients through Coinbase integration, enabling purchases funded from
existing accounts with crypto positions appearing alongside
traditional investments as the first major US lender offering direct
asset trading versus passive ETFs. The move is a customer retention
strategy that prevents migration to fintech platforms rather than
immediate demand response. Expansion to institutional accounts,
nonprofits, endowments, and foundations has been planned for early
2026. The launch extends Coinbase's push to supply crypto
infrastructure to banks, avoiding internal buildouts while PNC
provides banking and treasury services to Coinbase in return. 

 CIRCLE GETS ADGM GREENLIGHT IN ABU DHABI (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Circle has received a Money Services Provider license from Abu Dhabi
Global Market's FSRA. It can now offer regulated payment and
settlement services out of the UAE. With the license, Circle can push
USDC-based rails to businesses, banks, and developers across the
region under a clear, bespoke digital-asset regime. The firm has hired
ex-Visa exec Saeeda Jaffar as MD for the Middle East and Africa to
drive institutional partnerships and onchain payments adoption. This
move lands alongside ADGM's recognition of USDT on multiple chains and
Binance.com's full authorization, signaling a coordinated push to make
Abu Dhabi a key stablecoin and exchange hub.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE NEW CRYPTO MARKETING PLAYBOOK (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 “Intern meme accounts + mascots” aren't enough anymore as social
media algorithms now reward interaction, substance, and high-quality
production. Founder-led and team-led content, short-form video with
story, technical explainers for dev ecosystems, and cross-posting
podcast/AMA clips across YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc, currently
seem to be winning content strategies. Platform-specific writing and
clipping long-form founder content can be cheaper and more effective
than paying big KOLs. The long game is consistent, multi-person
content from inside the team, not one viral post or one charismatic
founder. 

 THE BLOCKCHAIN CANON (35 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Blockchain's canon split after The DAO's 2016 fork into financial
infrastructure focused on stablecoins and ETFs versus institutional
machinery pursuing DAOs and network states. This comprehensive
timeline spans from Chaum's 1983 blind signatures through Satoshi's
2008 whitepaper to 2025's GENIUS Act and Aztec's privacy-first
technical whitepaper, documenting how the unified cypherpunk vision
fractured when early governance experiments collided with reality. The
canon compiled includes cryptographic foundations, political
manifestos, catastrophic failures like Mt. Gox and Terra, regulatory
milestones, and the shift from protest-oriented infrastructure to
institutionally-recognized financial products as blockchain searches
for synthesis between its twin mythologies.

 PROPOSED ‘AFTERDARK' BITCOIN ETF WOULD SKIP US TRADING HOURS (5
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Nicholas Financial filed with the SEC for an "AfterDark" bitcoin ETF
holding BTC only from 4 pm to 9:30 am ET when US markets are closed,
rotating into short-term Treasuries during American trading sessions
based on data showing Bitcoin trending green overnight and red during
US hours. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas confirmed similar 2024
patterns, suggesting spot ETFs or derivatives positioning may be
driving the divergence. The fund is a novel approach that treats time
of day as a key strategy factor in the growing ecosystem of bitcoin
investment products. 

 BITWISE CIO SEES CRYPTO GROWING 10–20X IN THE NEXT DECADE (5 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan projects crypto growing 10-20x over the next
decade, citing SEC Chair Paul Atkins's expectation that all US
equities will move onchain within "a couple of years," contrasting $68
trillion in US equities against $670 million in tokenized stocks
today. Despite eight years working in crypto, Hougan argues that
blockchain winner-picking remains nearly impossible as outcomes depend
on regulation, execution, macro conditions, and luck among hundreds of
variables. Market-cap-weighted index exposure is preferable to
directional chain bets to avoid backing the wrong horse even in a
rapidly growing market.

 CFTC DIGITAL-ASSET COLLATERAL PILOT (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The CFTC's acting chair, Caroline Pham, has announced a digital
assets pilot program that will allow certain crypto assets (BTC, ETH,
and USDC) to be used as collateral in regulated derivatives markets. 

 ETHEREUM'S NEXT FRONTIER IS  VALIDATOR PRIVACY IN THE P2P LAYER (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Making validator networking private and fast requires attestation
gossip via an OHTTP-style two-hop relay (breaking the IP and validator
link), prioritized meshes using a ZK “proof-of-validator”
(sybil-resistant without revealing identity), rate-limiting nullifiers
to stop spam, and decoy traffic to hide behavioral patterns. 

 TOM LEE BUYS $435M ETHEREUM (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Bitmine, the “Strategy of Ethereum,” bought an additional $435
million of ETH, bringing its total holdings to over $12 billion. 

 TEMPO LAUNCHES PUBLIC TESTNET (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Tempo, the Stripe and Paradigm-backed payments chain, has launched a
testnet.
