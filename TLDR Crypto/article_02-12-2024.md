MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SPOT ETH ETFS CLOCKS HIGHEST DAILY INFLOW DAY: ‘ALT ROTATION HAS
BEGUN' (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 US Spot Ethereum ETFs hit a record high in daily inflows of over $330
million, surpassing the previous Nov 11 high of $295.5 million.
BlackRock's Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is responsible for the vast majority
of inflows. It now has over $2 billion in total inflows since its
launch on July 23. The Friday inflows were higher than BTC ETF flows
for the first time, potentially indicating that Wall Street is joining
the “alt rotation.” 

 BITCOIN IS FLYING HIGH—THESE COUNTRIES ARE CONSIDERING A NATIONAL
RESERVE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 As Bitcoin approaches $100K, several countries, including the United
States, Brazil, Poland, and Russia, are exploring establishing a
national Bitcoin reserve to improve economic resilience and diversify
reserves, an approach El Salvador pioneered. Recent proposals and
legislation highlight growing global interest in incorporating Bitcoin
into national strategies, though implementation remains uncertain.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 CURVE + ELIXIR + BLACKROCK: A $533M BRIDGE BETWEEN TRADFI AND DEFI (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Curve Finance, Elixir, and BlackRock have partnered to integrate
BlackRock's $533M tokenized fund (BUIDL) into DeFi to enable vetted
participants to mint deUSD, a yield-bearing synthetic dollar. Curve,
which hosts the majority of deUSD liquidity, is positioned as the
central hub for stablecoin trading, bridging TradFi and DeFi to create
more stable, liquid markets. 

 HYPERLIQUID'S NATIVE TOKEN DEBUTS AT FULLY DILUTED $4.2B MARKET CAP
(1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Decentralized perpetuals exchange and L1 blockchain HyperLiquid
recently airdropped its HYPE token, with 31% of the supply allocated
to former traders. Unlike recent airdrops, it immediately jumped in
value to a fully diluted valuation of over $4 billion. The token is
used to secure the network via proof of stake and to pay transaction
fees.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE 5 LEVELS OF SECURE HARDWARE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This framework by Paradigm proposes five evolutionary levels of
secure hardware development. The industry is currently at level 3,
which offers strong developer experience and GPU support for
applications like private ML inference but still relies on a
proprietary manufacturing process. The progression ranges from basic
oracle/bridge applications in Level 1 to Level 5's vision of
heterogeneous open, secure hardware networks capable of handling
sensitive global-scale operations like voting systems. Current tech
enables practical applications with hardware attestation, but Level 5
requires significant advances in open manufacturing processes and
hardware interconnectivity, with tradeoffs between security,
performance, and developer experience. 

 WHAT IS IT ALL FOR? ON INFRA FATIGUE AND THE PATH FORWARD FOR L1S (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The crypto industry has an issue with over-investing in
infrastructure at the expense of consumer applications. Current L1 and
L2s achieve only a few hundred TPS compared to the 10,000+ TPS needed
for mainstream adoption. While infra investment has enabled
improvements like cheaper transactions, future development should
focus on creating entirely new design spaces rather than marginal
improvements to existing solutions. Successful L1s should enable
transformative applications through significant performance
improvements.

 MECHANICS BEHIND DEBANKING (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Debanking is when a bank closes all of a customer's accounts, often
without providing a clear reason. This practice has gained attention
due to allegations that U.S. regulators pressured banks to sever ties
with certain industries, notably tech and crypto firms, effectively
restricting their access to financial services. 

 THE NEXT STEP FOR AI AGENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI agents are experiencing a transformative “DeFi Summer” moment,
with growing attention and capital inflows driven by agents' ability
to learn, adapt, and potentially integrate into every aspect of life,
from trading to personal productivity. However, for AI agents to
achieve the next 100x improvement, they must become highly
personalized while ensuring privacy and security of user data.
Solutions like Nillion's encrypted, privacy-enhancing technology offer
a path forward for secure personal data integration.

QUICK LINKS

 BASE CONFIRMS THERE WILL BE NO TOKEN (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Base has confirmed that there are currently no plans for a network
token. 

 HYPERLIQUID WAS THE BEST-EXECUTED AND MOST REWARDING AIRDROP (1
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Hyperliquid's airdrop and token generation event (TGE) set a new
standard by genuinely rewarding early users with incentives like
significant token drops and evolving engagement mechanics. 

 AI AGENT SWARMS COULD MIRROR FIVERR (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 An AI agent swarm could function as a marketplace like Fiverr, where
AI agents autonomously offer personalized services such as trading,
research, communication, and task automation on behalf of users. 

 HOW LIBRA WAS KILLED (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The demise of Meta's ambitious Libra project, a blockchain and
stablecoin system that aimed to revolutionize global payments, came
not from regulatory non-compliance but from political resistance, with
pressure from top U.S. officials to halt the initiative.
