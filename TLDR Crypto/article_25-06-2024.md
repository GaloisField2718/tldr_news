 ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAM EXECUTION (APE) IN SOLANA (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Asynchronous execution allows consensus votes to happen independently
of all other functions. Two primary Execution Domains,
VoteExecutionDomain (VED) and UserExecutionDomain (UED), must be
implemented to allow validators to vote before complete transaction
execution. This article details the components of VED, the process of
computing VED and UED states, and how funds can be moved between
domains. The system aims to improve Solana's efficiency and
scalability while maintaining integrity.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT ARE SGX PROOFS? (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SGX is a trusted execution environment from Intel that allows
information to be stored and processed in private hardware memory
called an enclave. Rollups can use SGX to privately execute state
transition functions while still being verifiable. However, SGX
requires trusting Intel, and zkEVMs would benefit from a multi-prover
setup to mitigate potential exploits. Taiko's Raiko multi-prover
supports several zkVMs and SGX.

 CRYPTO MAINTAINS DECENTRALIZED ORIGINS WHEREAS AI IS COMPARATIVELY
CENTRALIZED (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 While AI and crypto are both transformative technologies, they differ
fundamentally in their origin and function. AI has developed in a
centralized fashion and generates a lot of data, making verification
challenging. Crypto has developed in a decentralized fashion and is
used to authenticate data. 

 STATE OF SOLANA DEPIN 2024 (29 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Solana DePIN, which includes category leaders Helium, Hivemapper, and
Render, has a combined market cap of $4 billion. Solana's focus on
performance and network effects and the Solana Foundation's support of
DePIN have given it a first-mover advantage with dozens of projects
that have built innovative networks. This article details projects in
wireless, storage, sensor, compute, service, and other categories of
DePIN on Solana. It predicts more sectors, rollups, and convergence
with RWAs, ultimately resulting in a parallel infrastructure system.
