 TRUMP'S ‘CRYPTO CZAR' FLOATS BITCOIN RESERVE AS WHITE HOUSE PUSHES
SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 President Trump's newly appointed “crypto czar,” David Sacks,
confirmed that evaluating a strategic bitcoin reserve is a top
priority, aligning with the administration's broader pro-crypto
agenda. This comes as Trump signed an executive order to establish a
U.S. sovereign wealth fund. Analysts speculate that bitcoin could be
included as a strategic asset to help bolster national reserves. 

 WILL TRUMP'S TRADE WAR BRING AN EARLY END TO THE BITCOIN BULL MARKET?
(4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin's recent drop below $92K amid Trump's trade war announcement
triggered fears of an early bull market end, but strong demand and
historical patterns suggest further upside. Analysts project a peak
between $160K and $210K in late 2025. Key indicators, including
long-term holder supply and the Pi Cycle Top, signal that Bitcoin has
yet to reach its final cycle high. A potential top is expected around
September–October 2025.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 STORY PROTOCOL WHITEPAPER: A PEER-TO-PEER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
NETWORK (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Story Protocol is building an IP blockchain that has a programmable
market for knowledge and creativity assets through a multi-core
execution environment that combines EVM compatibility with specialized
cores for IP management, offchain synchronization, and cross-chain
communication. The platform features a Proof of Creativity protocol
for IP registration with customizable usage parameters and has a
native IP token for network security and transaction processing.
Potential applications include a universal market for intelligence, a
foundational layer for AI interactions through the Agent TCP/IP
protocol, and infrastructure for autonomous agent-to-agent commerce. 

 BERACHAIN HONEYPAPER: PROOF OF LIQUIDITY (30 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Berachain's novel blockchain architecture introduces Proof of
Liquidity (PoL), which aims to align network security with liquidity
provision. It leverages a dual-token model consisting of BERA (gas and
staking) and BGT (governance and rewards). It will be an
EVM-compatible chain and introduce an incentives marketplace where
protocols can bid for validator emissions using whitelisted tokens,
while validators can direct emissions toward reward vaults based on
economic preferences. The protocol's architecture incorporates
immediate execution and optimistic payload bundling to reduce block
times by up to 40%. Its economic model aims to solve traditional L1
problems by adjusting validator rewards based on demand for validator
security rather than preset curves.

 EVOLVING COINBASE WALLET TO BRING THE WORLD ONCHAIN (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Coinbase Wallet is being rebuilt to be 10x faster, easier to use, and
more integrated with onchain social experiences, using Farcaster's
social graph and mini-apps to enhance app discovery. The 2025 vision
focuses on streamlining crypto payments, enabling builders to go
viral, and creating a seamless experience for traders, creators, and
communities to engage in the onchain economy. 

 THOUGHTS ON FAIR LAUNCHES (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Current fair launch token models, which distribute 85-95% of supply
at launch while leaving teams with only 5-15%, create operational
challenges for long-term project development compared to traditional
VC funding where teams retain 80-90% ownership. It leads to inadequate
liquidity management, difficulties in team compensation, and
unsustainable resource allocation for development, particularly
impacting teams building complex technical solutions that require
extended development cycles. While fair launches aim to democratize
early access traditionally reserved for VCs, the approach often
undermines project sustainability and forces builders to prioritize
short-term token economics over long-term technological development.

 YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE DEFAI OPPORTUNITY WRONG (10 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The DeFAI market is in the midst of a serious correction, with market
caps dropping over 50% from their mid-January peaks. The sector is
undervalued and could grow to represent 10% of the $125 billion DeFi
market. There are three value segments underpinning this belief:
Information Agents focusing on UI abstraction and analysis, smart DeFi
enabling automated actions, and Alpha Hunters that combine data
analysis with autonomous execution. Despite market skepticism,
AI-native teams are better positioned to compete in inefficient
markets where returns are increasingly attributed to intelligence
rather than human intervention. 

 CRYPTO CZAR DAVID SACKS HAS SAID NFTS AND MEMECOINS ARE COLLECTIBLES,
NOT SECURITIES (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 White House crypto czar David Sacks argues that NFTs and memecoins
should be classified as collectibles, like baseball cards or stamps,
rather than securities or commodities, which would exempt them from
stricter financial regulations. While his remarks don't change their
legal status, they highlight the ongoing debate over how digital
assets should be regulated and taxed in the U.S.
