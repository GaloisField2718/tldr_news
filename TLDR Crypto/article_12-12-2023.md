 BEYOND THE EVM: APPLICATION-SPECIFIC ROLLUPS WITH A LINUX RUNTIME
(SPONSOR) [6] 

 App-specific rollups offer a new space for limitless exploration and
for pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in Web3.
Cartesi [6]¬†provides your dApp with a dedicated rollup with its own
CPU and Linux environment ‚Äî meaning you can¬†scale computation while
preserving decentralization [6], security, and censorship resistance.
Basically:

 	* dApps don‚Äôt compete with each other for processing power like
they do on Ethereum; and
 	* You can use familiar libraries, languages and open-source tooling.

Put those two together, and it‚Äôs a whole new world of possibilities.

 US SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN INTRODUCES BILL TO "CRACK DOWN" ON
BITCOIN AND CRYPTO (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 US Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed a bill to tackle alleged
misuse of cryptocurrencies in various illegal activities like money
laundering, drug trafficking, and sanctions evasion. The bill calls
for increased regulation within the sector, specifically by extending
Bank Secrecy Act responsibilities, and is supported by a coalition
from the Banking Committee. This news gave the crypto market a scare
but is not being viewed as too threatening given Warren‚Äôs poor
record of getting bills over the finish line.

are set to take effect on January 29.

the combination of Uniswap's smart contract capabilities with
Bitcoin's security, potentially resulting in deeper liquidity and more
use cases for the largest asset base in the crypto industry. This

 ORDINALS 101: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Earlier this year, Ordinals, essentially NFTs on Bitcoin, took the
space by storm and has since maintained strong momentum. Ordinals,
contrary to traditional NFTs which usually point to an IPFS link, are
actually directly inscribed on satoshis, the smallest Bitcoin units.
Each Satoshi is made unique through ordinals and given content through
inscriptions. With this sudden popularity, the change has also sparked
debates about what Bitcoin's function should be, with concerns around
chain congestion emerging. However, miners haven‚Äôt been concerned
with this, generating around $38.7M revenue in ordinal-related
transactions in November.

 NEW SIGNS OF LIFE FOR NFTS ON ETHEREUM & L2S (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This post outlines a few of the green shoots the NFT space is seeing
after a 90%+ decline in volume throughout the bear market. Growth in
the creation and collection of NFTs is increasing across Ethereum and
L2 solutions such as Zora, Base, and Optimism. There has been an
increase in the number of unique addresses minting paid NFTs as of
late. Infrastructure improvements have helped lower minting costs,
making it easier and more affordable to create NFTs and opening up new
use cases. 

 LAYER 2S CURB ETHEREUM‚ÄôS SUCCESS (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Ethereum's L2 solutions, although seen as crucial to scaling the
network, may only offer temporary relief rather than addressing core
issues. While L2 solutions can increase speed, decrease costs, and
widen demographic accessibility, their drawbacks could affect
Ethereum's long-term growth. Among the potential issues are liquidity
fragmentation, limited dapp composability, and security risks from
centralization. Ethereum should strengthen its core infrastructure
rather than relying heavily on intermediary scaling solutions.
