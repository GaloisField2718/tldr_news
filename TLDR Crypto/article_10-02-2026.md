MARKETS & BUSINESS

 POLYMARKET SUES MASSACHUSETTS OVER WHO REGULATES PREDICTION MARKETS
(1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Polymarket filed a federal lawsuit against Massachusetts, arguing
that prediction markets are federally regulated derivatives under the
CFTC's authority, not state-level gambling products, as states like
Massachusetts and Nevada move to shut down sports-related event
contracts. The case highlights a growing state-vs-federal conflict
that could determine whether prediction markets are governed
nationally as financial instruments or locally as gambling, especially
as the CFTC signals a more permissive stance. 

 BITMINE'S 40,613 ETH BUY PUSHES TREASURY TO 4.33M ETH (1 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 BitMine bought 40,613 ETH in a week to bring its treasury to
4,325,738 ETH (~$9.2B, ~3.58% of circulating supply), with 2,897,459
ETH (67%) now staked, generating about $202M annualized. The firm is
nearing its target of 5% of ETH supply and is planning MAVAN staking
rollouts that could boost staking revenue further.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 REGISTER AN MCP SERVER USING ERC-8004 (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Ethereum Foundation released a technical tutorial for registering
Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers onchain using ERC-8004 to address
the trust gap in LLM-to-external-tool communication standards.
ERC-8004 establishes three on-chain registries — Identity,
Reputation, and Validation — enabling decentralized discovery and
reputation-building for AI agents and MCP tools, with implementation
via Agent0 SDK and IPFS. 

 MEGAETH LAUNCHES “REAL-TIME” MAINNET (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 MegaETH launched a “real-time” mainnet claiming 50,000 TPS and 10
ms blocks using a SALT (Small Authentication Large Trie) in-memory
design to cut latency. MegaEth runs execution offchain while using
Ethereum for settlement. It went live with 50+ apps after an
oversubscribed $1.39B token sale.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HYPERLIQUID VS. CME (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hyperliquid's HIP-3 TradFi expansion now represents 31% of venue
volume with $5B+ daily notional, with Blockworks Research's
high-frequency microstructure analysis of silver trading revealing
mixed performance against CME/COMEX benchmarks during last Friday's
31% crash triggered by Trump's Warsh Fed Chair nomination. Pre-crash,
HIP-3 delivered superior execution for retail-sized clips with 2.4 bps
spreads versus 3 bps on COMEX, but during the volatility event,
spreads widened 2.1x compared to 1.6x on traditional venues with brief
dislocations exceeding 400 bps. Hyperliquid's core differentiation
emerged over the weekend as the only exchange-like silver derivatives
venue operating continuously, processing 175k trades and $257M
notional across 49 hours with median spreads compressing to 0.93 bps. 

 WHAT ETHEREUM SHIPPED THIS MONTH (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethereum's monthly recap highlights major ecosystem developments,
including Fidelity launching its FIDD stablecoin on Ethereum, ERC-8004
going live for AI agent identity/reputation, the EF forming a
post-quantum research team, and Morgan Stanley proposing a spot ETH
ETF. Infrastructure milestones include a new L1 transaction ATH, the
BPO2 fork increasing blob targets, Ondo expanding to 200+ tokenized
equities, Lido V3 launching modular staking vaults, and multiple L2
upgrades across Arbitrum, Optimism, Mantle, and Polygon.

MISCELLANEOUS

 L2S VIBES SHOULD MATCH SUBSTANCE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vitalik criticizes the proliferation of generic EVM chains with
optimistic bridges as a dead end comparable to governance token forks,
urging builders to pursue meaningful differentiation through privacy,
app-specific efficiency, or ultra-low latency. He shares two
legitimate architectural approaches: deep L1 integration (e.g.,
prediction markets settling on L1 with trading on based rollups)
versus institutional transparency layers (governments/platforms
posting merkle roots with STARKs for algorithmic accountability). His
core mandate is to deliver genuine technical innovation beyond
commoditized infrastructure, and ensure public positioning accurately
reflects the actual degree of Ethereum L1 connection. 

 THE LONG GAME FOR CRYPTO (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Non-financial crypto use cases aren't dead but following a
predictable sequence where finance naturally emerges first as
blockchain's core primitive of coordinating capital at internet scale.
Crypto needs hundreds of millions onchain through financial
applications before media, gaming, and AI categories can develop,
similar to how the internet required TCP/IP infrastructure before
social platforms emerged. The GENIUS Act is evidence that regulatory
progress can materialize rapidly when political windows open. The
CLARITY Act potentially extends this framework to broader token
categories.

 ERC-8004 IS LIVE ON CELO (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Celo deployed ERC-8004, an AI agent infrastructure standard, on its
L2 alongside tooling including Celo Agent Skills and thirdweb's x402
payment integration. 

 ZKEVM: ETHEREUM'S NEXT “MERGE” (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The zkEVM fork will be Ethereum's biggest upgrade, bigger even than
the Merge, because a native zkEVM precompile would let the L1 verify
EVM validity proofs, effectively turning the L1 into a ZK rollup and
delivering the low fees, fast transactions, and massive scalability
users actually want. 

 SELF-CUSTODY WALLETS ARE OUTSCALING FINTECH (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Crypto wallets are beginning to rival and surpass major fintechs in
funded accounts, with MetaMask at ~30M and Phantom at ~16M, beating
SoFi, Chime, and even Wise despite having no bank licenses or
incentives. 

 INSTITUTIONS AREN'T REINVENTING FINANCE; BUILDERS WILL (1 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Institutional “blockchain adoption” is largely about
optimization, not transformation, mirroring how the internet made
incumbents more efficient while real disruption came from new
internet-native companies.
