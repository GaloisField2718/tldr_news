 FUSAKA & ETHEREUM'S NEW UPGRADE CADENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Fusaka, Ethereum's 17th major upgrade, just went live, marking the
start of a planned twice-a-year hard-fork schedule. The main change is
PeerDAS, plus two “blob parameter only” follow-ups (into January),
which together can boost blob capacity by up to 8x, making rollups
cheaper and more scalable. Fusaka also adds a blob fee floor, higher
and safer gas limits, and native secp256r1/passkey support, while
quietly laying groundwork for future ZK and quantum-resilience
improvements. 

 UK RECOGNIZES CRYPTO AS NEW ASSET CLASS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The UK's Property Act 2025 has received Royal Assent from King
Charles III, establishing crypto as a third property category distinct
from physical objects and contractual rights after passing both houses
without amendment. The Law Commission recommended the reform in 2023
to provide clearer legal pathways for proving ownership, recovering
stolen assets, and handling digital holdings in insolvency or estate
cases beyond existing case-by-case court judgments. It is potentially
the biggest change in English property law since the Middle Ages. The
UK aims to match US stablecoin regulation speed with new rules
operational on comparable timelines.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PEERDAS MEANS REAL SHARDING FINALLY LIVE ON ETHEREUM (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Fusaka's PeerDAS is sharding. Ethereum now reaches consensus on
blocks without any single node having to see all the data, using
client-side sampling instead of validator voting. That means L2s can
scale to far more data and transactions while keeping Ethereum's
security guarantees, and this is even robust to 51% attacks. The L1,
however, still doesn't benefit fully without mature zkEVMs, block
building is still centralized in builders, and there's no sharded
mempool yet. Over the next two years, the plan is to scale up PeerDAS
for L2s, then point it inward to increase L1 gas capacity once zkEVMs
are ready. 

 TAIWAN'S FIRST REGULATED STABLECOIN DEBUTING NEXT YEAR (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission confirmed the island's
first regulated stablecoin could launch late 2026 after the Virtual
Assets Service Act cleared cabinet reviews with stablecoin-specific
regulations following within six months, though the critical decision
between USD or Taiwan dollar backing remains unresolved. A USD-pegged
token bypasses strict currency export controls, keeping the Taiwan
dollar onshore, while a TWD stablecoin enabling cross-border
settlement would directly challenge decades of central bank policy
preventing unofficial offshore pricing. Financial institutions will
lead initial issuance under rules requiring full reserve backing,
strict asset segregation, and domestic custody requirements.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 IN DEFENSE OF EXPONIENTALS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 New blockchain launches like Monad face unprecedented hate instead of
the historical indifference or enthusiasm, with critics applying P/E
ratios and revenue multiples that represent abandoning exponential
thinking for linear growth assumptions, capping crypto at 30 million
DAUs and under 1% of M2. Amazon took 22 years to turn profitable after
10 years of stock chop, while critics called it a VC-subsidized
charity, yet Ethereum is only 10 years old as crypto's center of
gravity shifted from Silicon Valley's exponential mindset to Wall
Street's linear regime focused on metrics like Solana's REV. Crypto
transforms financial assets into open file formats, making everything
24/7, global, and interconnected, positioning blockchains to gobble up
all finance with adoption, rendering current valuations cheap if you
believe the exponential rather than applying traditional valuation
frameworks to an industry still in its growth phase. 

 WELCOME TO POST-CT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto Twitter (CT) as a coordination mechanism is failing as the
monoculture era ends. CT once compressed narrative discovery, trust
routing, and reflexive allocation into one interface that synchronized
ecosystems around dominant metas, producing visible winners at scale.
The regime degraded as playbooks industrialized, closing inefficiency
windows faster, extraction layers harvested median participants as
exit liquidity, and attention fragmented across niches rather than
converging on shared focal points that generated common knowledge.
Post-CT means CT shifts from upstream engine determining flows to
downstream interface layer broadcasting reputational signals while
actual allocation occurs inside higher-trust subgraphs like operator
circles, sector communities, and private institutional rooms.

 A MIS-PRICING OF "OWNERSHIP" COINS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ownership coins with futarchy-controlled DAOs offer robust treasury
claims, creating asymmetric opportunities as tokens trading below
treasury value provide liquidation floors demonstrated by MTN
Capital's successful dissolution, while those with treasury
representing the majority of market cap should be valued on discounted
enterprise value. SOLO appears most mispriced with $13 million
treasury against $15 million market cap, implying $2 million
enterprise value versus an estimated $10-20 million pre-money
valuation for a post-product stablecoin team, offering 2-4x upside
with limited downside. Projects like LOYAL and PAYS trading below
treasury represent free call options where worst-case liquidation
generates profit while maintaining team execution upside, contrasting
traditional startup equity's illiquidity and long horizons. The
framework applies when tokens meet three criteria: high liquidity,
treasury exceeding 75% of valuation, and short liquidation timelines
with robust asset rights, fundamentally changing risk-reward
calculations as downside floors compress while preserving asymmetric
upside, unlike governance tokens with zero liquidation value. 

 BLACKROCK AND COINBASE CEO CHAT (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong declared 2025 the year crypto regulation
became real, citing the GENIUS Act and bipartisan House market
structure bill advancing to the Senate, while defending Fairshake's
$78 million election spending as transparent advocacy for 52 million
American crypto users. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink evolved from calling
Bitcoin "money laundering" to viewing it as an "asset of fear" held
against deficits and currency debasement after thousands of client
conversations influenced his thinking. Armstrong dismissed bank
anxiety over stablecoin deposit flight as regulatory capture
protecting profit margins and predicted banks will embrace paying
interest on stablecoins within two years as the best institutions lean
into the opportunity per the Innovator's Dilemma.
