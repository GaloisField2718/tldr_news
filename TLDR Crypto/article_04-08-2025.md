MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CIRCLE FACES MARGIN SQUEEZE AS USDC PAYOUTS RISE, SAYS MIZUHO (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Circle earned $625M in Q2 interest income from USDC reserves but paid
out $332.5M to Coinbase, raising concerns about shrinking margins as
Circle adds new distribution partners like Binance. Despite USDC's
growing supply (~$63B), analysts flagged stagnant circulation, looming
rate cuts, and rising partner payouts as medium-term risks. They also
warned that the GENIUS Act's regulatory clarity could invite more
competition from giants like JPMorgan and Bank of America. 

 $3.5B LUBIAN BITCOIN THEFT WENT UNDETECTED FOR 5 YEARS (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Arkham Intelligence claims to have uncovered evidence of the theft of
127,426 BTC from Chinese mining pool LuBian in December 2020, which
would represent the largest cryptocurrency heist in history at $3.5
billion at the time of theft, now valued at $14.5 billion. The breach
went undetected for nearly five years, with neither LuBian nor the
suspected hacker ever publicly acknowledging the incident, though
Arkham discovered over 1,500 onchain messages from LuBian pleading for
the funds' return. The theft likely resulted from weak private key
generation that enabled a brute-force attack, with the stolen Bitcoin
remaining largely dormant except for a wallet consolidation in July
2024. LuBian controlled nearly 6% of Bitcoin's hash rate in 2020. The
scale of this theft exceeds other notorious hacks like Mt. Gox and
Bitfinex by nominal value at the time of loss.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AAVE V4 INTRODUCES UNIFIED LIQUIDITY HUB AND MODULAR SPOKES (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Aave V4 will revamp DeFi lending with a “Liquidity Hub” that
consolidates all assets into one central pool per chain, eliminating
V3's fragmented market inefficiencies. Users interact through modular
“Spokes” tailored for use cases like stablecoins (E-Mode), new
assets (Isolation), tokenized RWAs, or vault collateral. Each Spoke
has customized risk settings and authorization control, while the Hub
enforces global accounting and withdrawal limits. The design allows
anyone to build custom Spokes that plug into Aave's liquidity boosting
composability, efficiency, and rate competitiveness across lending
markets. 

 10-YEAR 'LEAN ETHEREUM' VISION: 10K TPS, 100% UPTIME, EVM 2.0 (10
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Justin Drake of the Ethereum Foundation laid out a “lean
Ethereum” ten-year blueprint targeting 10,000 TPS at 1 gigagas/sec
on Layer 1 and 1 million TPS at 1 teragas/sec on Layer 2, while
preserving 100% uptime and decentralization. The plan calls for
“bold upgrades” across all L1 sublayers, including Beacon Chain
2.0 for consensus, post-quantum Blobs 2.0 for data, and an
RISC-V-based EVM 2.0 for execution, plus hash-based cryptography for
quantum resistance. Emphasizing minimalism, modularity, formal
verification, and provable security, the vision aims to deliver
“performance abundance” under unforgiving continuity constraints.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 FINANCE IS HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Financial systems are struggling under pressure. JPMorgan has begun
charging for open banking amid regulatory disarray, and autonomous AI
agents are trading stocks via browser tabs. A crypto treasury company
holding BTC staged 2025's largest IPO, outpacing even Circle, as
TradFi investors scramble for indirect exposure. Meanwhile, Ramp
raised $500M at a $22.5B valuation just 45 days after its last round,
betting on AI-powered finance teams. JPM's partnership with Coinbase
reopens card rails, but only through closed deals, not open protocols.
It all adds up to a market “mania moment” where innovation is
real, incentives are distorted, and systemic risks are compounding
fast. 

 BITCOIN TREASURYCOS: LESSONS FROM THE 1929 CRASH (15 MINUTE READ) [9]


 There are striking parallels between today's Bitcoin treasury
companies and the investment trust explosion of the 1920s. While
modern treasuries like MicroStrategy boast transparency, SEC
compliance, and capital structure agility, they still rely on the same
reflexive dynamics: leverage, mNAV premiums, and rising prices fueling
further demand. Just like the trusts before 1929, these companies may
look safe, until they aren't. Lacking yield and cash flows, Bitcoin
treasuries risk pyramid-like fragility if BTC prices stall or reverse.
Reflexivity cuts both ways. The “financial alchemy” sustaining the
boom could also engineer its bust.

 STABLECOIN ADOPTION ISN'T A TECH PROBLEM, IT'S AN INCENTIVE PROBLEM
(2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Stablecoin adoption is less about lower fees or faster settlement,
and more about solving a multiplayer coordination game. Each
transaction touches users, banks, and processors, none of whom want to
move first due to switching costs like lost float or operational
retraining. To succeed, builders must find wedge use cases where a
single actor (like a cardholder) can adopt unilaterally and extract
clear value. Stablecoin cards, for instance, grow faster than merchant
rails because the user doesn't need to wait for ecosystem buy-in.
Incentives, not just infrastructure, ultimately determine stablecoin
success. 

 ONHAIN ANALYSIS SUGGESTS PARADIGM LIKELY HOLDS $765M+ IN HYPE (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Paradigm may be the largest $HYPE holder, with ~19.1M tokens worth
$765M at $40 p/HYPE. The analysis links a 4.18M HYPE transfer from
Wintermute in December, publicly confirmed by Paradigm's Matt Huang,
to 10 newly split wallets. Additional bulk withdrawals via FalconX and
Gate.io, grouped by timing and structure, further support the theory.
The estimated cost basis is ~$16.46/HYPE, implying ~$450M in
unrealized gains. Though unconfirmed, the pattern of wallet activity,
stealth setups, and ties to the Paradigm-affiliated entity “Sonn”
strengthen the attribution. If accurate, Paradigm controls ~2% of
total HYPE supply and ~6% of circulating supply.
