MARKETS & BUSINESS

 ITALY PLANS TO RAISE CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON BITCOIN FROM 26% TO 42% (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 According to Vice Economy Minister Maurizio Leo, Italy plans to
increase the capital gains tax on bitcoin and other crypto from 26% to
42% in its 2025 budget to generate funds for social support programs.
This move comes despite Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's earlier
statement that there would be no new taxes for citizens. Taxes for
other assets will stay at 26%. 

 A16Z'S STATE OF CRYPTO (60 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In its annual report, a16z Crypto found that crypto activity and
usage are at all-time highs, with over 220 million monthly active
addresses. Stablecoins are the clearest example of product-market fit
with $8.2 trillion in transaction volume in Q2, doubling Visa's
volume. Scaling costs have dropped by over 99%, and the crypto x AI
narrative has legitimate use cases. NFTs are less speculative and have
become social experiences.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 MAINNET IS LIVE — INTRODUCING FUEL IGNITION (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Fuel Labs has launched Fuel Ignition, a high-performance Ethereum L2
solution powered by the FuelVM. It is designed to combat blockchain
centralization by creating scalable architecture on consumer hardware.
Ignition offers fast, low-cost transactions with parallel execution,
supports all Ethereum and Solana wallets, and aims to retain
Ethereum's core values of decentralization, security, and
community-driven development. 

 CONDUIT G2: THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL SEQUENCER (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Conduit G2 is a new, production-ready sequencer that's 10x more
powerful than default sequencers for Arbitrum Nitro and Optimism
Superchains. It delivers 50-100 Megagas/s, equivalent to nearly 5,000
ETH transfers per second, and has a long-term goal of achieving
Gigagas speeds. G2 is already live on Gravity Chain and Proof of Play.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 DEEP DIVE INTO TIMEDOTFUN (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Time is a platform that tokenizes creators' time into redeemable
currency, allowing users to purchase “minutes” priced on a bonding
curve and redeem them for events like calls, messages, and group
chats, with ~95% of redeemed value going to the creator. Addressing
weaknesses of previous SocialFi apps like Friendtech, Time offers
features like redemption options, sustainable third-party
extensibility, and creator-controlled pricing, making it a promising
evolution in the creator monetization space. 

 BLOB EIPS AND MINIMUM VALIDATOR REQUIREMENTS (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Four EIPs related to blob management and calldata costs aiming to
optimize Ethereum's DA and fee mechanisms have been advanced to
consideration status. Despite concerns for solo stakers about
increased bandwidth requirements, they would lower the max block size.
Reducing the minimum stake for running a node would be a bad idea due
to the need for accountability and sybil resistance. Out-of-protocol
options already allow solo-stakers to stake with for lower collateral.

MISCELLANEOUS

 L2S ARE THE NEW OLD L1S (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum has not won the L1 wars - Solana, Avalanche, and Near have
innovated to remain competitive. New L2s now resemble past L1s,
relying on low fees and airdrop farming for user retention and
acquisition instead of proper product-market fit. The unclear value
accrual from L2s to ETH and the resurgence of alt-L1s could explain
ETH's price stagnation. 

 LIQUID TOKENS & MEMES - WHAT NEXT? (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Despite strong fundamentals, liquid tokens of real crypto businesses
are undervalued and represent a compelling investment case. This
author contrasts this value with memecoins, suggesting each has merit
for different reasons. The market is shifting toward fundamentally
driven valuations, and there may be a time when altcoins with strong
fundamentals outperform. One investment approach is to be in both
memecoins and high-quality value-driven altcoins.
