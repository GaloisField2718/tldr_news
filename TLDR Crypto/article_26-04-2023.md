BINANCE BAILS ON $1B VOYAGER ASSET DEAL (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://blockworks.co/news/binance-bails-voyager-asset-deal?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Binance has canceled its $1 billion asset purchase of bankrupt
Voyager, citing an "uncertain regulatory environment in the United
States." Voyager expressed disappointment and announced plans to
return value to customers via direct distributions on their platform.
The acquisition, initiated in December, faced opposition from the
Department of Justice in March. Voyager filed for bankruptcy in July
2022 following TerraUSD's collapse, leading to the suspension of
activity, including customer deposits, withdrawals, and trading on its
platform. 

ETHEREUM DEXS ATTRACT MOST TRADERS SINCE 2021 AS MEMECOIN POPULARITY
SOARS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theblock.co/post/228099/ethereum-dex-nft-traders-memecoins?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Ethereum-based DEXs saw a spike in trading activity over the past
week, reaching over 72,000 daily traders on April 19th, the highest
level since 2021. The increase was primarily driven by a memecoin
frenzy, with tokens like $PEPE seeing significant short-term surges.
At the same time, this sucked liquidity from the NFT ecosystem with
NFT volumes declining to their lowest level since July 2021. The rise
in DEX trading activity led to higher gas fees on Ethereum - some of
the highest levels weâ€™ve seen in the bear market - which could have
also contributed to the lack of activity in NFTs.

HOW TO BECOME A SMART CONTRACT AUDITOR (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://cmichel.io/how-to-become-a-smart-contract-auditor/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This article is an oldie but a goodie and provides advice on becoming
a smart contract security auditor in the Ethereum or EVM space. To
begin, one must be fluent in programming, with JavaScript being a
beginner-friendly and versatile option. Next, learn the basics of the
ETH blockchain and Solidity by solving Capture the Flag (CTF) security
challenges. After conquering the basics, you should familiarize
yourself with widely-used smart contracts and patterns, and study the
basics of finance. You can then gain real experience by participating
in bug bounties or audit contests. Finally, stay up-to-date with
security news, understand the compensation structure, and improve your
scoping and auditing skills. 

MONTHLY UPDATES LAUNCHED FOR ELECTRIC CAPITALâ€™S DEVELOPER REPORT (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1648787738907365378.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Electric Capital has launched its Developer Report dashboard which
will be updated monthly, tracking the growth and activity of crypto
developers. The Q1 2023 report reveals that there are currently 21.5k
developers (~7k full-time), with 8.7k new repos and 9.3k new devs in
Q1. However, these numbers have dipped relative to the previous few
quarters, potentially due to the cyclicality of the crypto market and
just general seasonality. Full-time developers make up 75% of commits
and maintain coding volume even in bear markets. Notable ecosystems
with the highest growth in full-time developers for Q1 2023 include
Aztec Network, MetaMask, Status, Hyperledger, and Taiko.

COMPARING THE TOP 5 CHAINS BY ECONOMIC ACTIVITY (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://polynya.mirror.xyz/1ZTJ3_BG2-wnBTy6dJLM5E3TPH8wvLGKQVDAnv7VLIw?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This article argues that economic activity is the most important
metric to evaluate a blockchain on. The author introduces the concepts
of passive and active economic activity. The top two chains, Ethereum
and Bitcoin, have high passive economic activity, storing significant
amounts of value. Ethereum also excels in active economic activity.
The next three contenders, Tron, Arbitrum One, and Binance Smart
Chain, show varying levels of passive and active economic activity.
The author indicates that Bitcoin and Ethereum are far ahead of the
following three chains in terms of economic activity and by the same
token, those three are far ahead of other ecosystems outside of the
top five. It will likely take some creativity and innovation for a new
protocol to break the network effects of these five and make it into
the top five. 

GENSLER SUING CHUCK E. CHEESE (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://jarvislabs.substack.com/p/gensler-suing-chuck-e-cheese?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Gary Gensler, SEC Chairman, faced questions regarding Ethereum's
status as a security during a House Financial Services Committee
hearing, but failed to give a clear answer. The crypto community is
now questioning Gensler's approach to regulation even more, as some
argue it hurts retail investors. Classifying ETH as a security could
at the very least negatively impact its price and have broader
implications for the entire crypto market. However, Ethereum's age and
support from major companies could protect it from such a designation.
Despite this, Gensler continues targeting smaller decentralized
projects, causing confusion and uncertainty in the crypto space.
Fortunately for the crypto community, even some members of Congress
are pushing back against Gensler's approach, which may prompt further
debates on crypto regulation amongst the regulators themselves.
