 LEDGER PATCHES VULNERABILITY AFTER MULTIPLE DAPPS USING CONNECTOR
LIBRARY WERE COMPROMISED (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Several dapps using Ledger‚Äôs wallet connector kit faced security
breaches yesterday. This included platforms like SushiSwap, Zapper,
Phantom, Balancer, and Revoke.cash. Ledger later announced that the
malicious code had been replaced with an updated, safe version of the
code. Applications across the crypto ecosystem were vulnerable to this
exploit, so it created quite a scare in the space. Fortunately, the
attacker only got away with ~$600k in stolen funds, which were later
frozen by Tether.

 WHEN TO SELL YOUR BLOCKS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post discusses proposer-builder separation auctions,
specifically comparing early auctions to just-in-time ones like
MEV-Boost. Early auctions sell the right to produce a block prior to
its creation. The post paints potential bidders as dominant CEX-DEX
arbitrageurs due to high capital requirements, risk management, and
less information during early auctions. The impact on users could be
beneficial, with features like pre-confirmations, or potentially
negative, with challenges like monopoly pricing. Ultimately though,
the benefits of early auctions over JIT ones remain unclear.

into how the self-custody of personal data and attestation could
change with these technologies. The piece also acknowledges challenges
in standardizing these fast-developing technologies but envisions a
future with decentralized control of digital identities. It concludes
by highlighting research areas concerning digital identity, primarily
privacy and inclusivity. 

 ORACLES AND THE NEW FRONTIER FOR APPLICATION-OWNED ORDERFLOW AUCTIONS
(8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This post from Multicoin lays out the firm‚Äôs thesis on Pyth
Network, an oracle protocol on Solana. While it focuses on Pyth, the
analysis can be broadly applied to the oracle landscape in general.
Its uniqueness lies within its first-party data, which is directly
provided by market makers and trading desks instead of third-party
aggregators. This results in less latent, high-quality data brought
on-chain. Launched in 2021, Pyth currently delivers data to over 45
different chains and is responsible for securing over $1.7B in value
across many prominent protocols in the crypto industry.
