MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC REJECTS CBOE SOL ETF FILING (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The U.S. SEC has rejected Cboe BZX's filings for two Solana ETFs,
following the SEC's stance that Solana qualifies as a security.
Despite the setback, the issuers, 21Shares and VanEck, remain active
on the SEC's filing system and may consider refiling with revisions
arguing that Solana is not a security.

 CORN: THE SUPER YIELD NETWORK ROOTED IN DIGITAL GOLD (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Corn is a new Ethereum Layer 2 network that uses Bitcoin as the gas
token, designed to align users, apps, and token holders by creating a
yield-driven ecosystem. Following a $6.7 million seed round led by

tokens, $BTCN and $CORN, offering various ways to engage and earn
within the network. 

 BALAJI'S NETWORK STATE BECOMES A REALITY IN SINGAPORE (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Renowned crypto and Silicon Valley investor Balaji Srinivasan has
launched a new experimental pop-up city in Singapore called "The
Network School". It's a 3-month long pop-up that hopes to redefine
education, career development, and community engagement through four
core themes: "Learn, Burn, Earn, and Fun". The effort will prioritize
providing a platform for "dark talent" and embracing innovative
approaches like crypto-credentials.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 SOCIAL MEDIA FOR STARTUP FOUNDERS (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Social media offers a chance for startup founders to build their
brands and connect directly with their audience. However, crafting an
effective social media presence requires a strategic approach,
including setting realistic goals, understanding one's audience,
prioritizing platforms, and creating engaging content that resonates
with users. This approach must be dynamic, adapting to changing
platform algorithms and audience expectations, and should incorporate
both quantitative and qualitative metrics to gauge success and inform
strategy adjustments. 

 AAVE, THE CORE PILLAR OF DECENTRALIZED FINANCE AND ONCHAIN ECONOMY
(10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Aave is the leading decentralized borrowing and lending protocol,
with over $7.5 billion in active loans. Its fundamentals have
surpassed previous bull market highs, but the token trades at
historically low valuation multiples. With upcoming improvements like
Aave v4, revamped tokenomics, and growth from greater crypto adoption,
Aave is positioned for significant expansion.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ETH - WHERE DO WE STAND? (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Ethereum debate is increasingly polarized, with strong arguments
from both bulls and bears. Bears argue that Ethereum's profitability
and dominance are in decline due to fragmented Layer 2s, DeFi's shaky
utility, and ETH's lackluster ETF performance, while bulls highlight
record-high transactions, Ethereum's robust ecosystem, and its
continued role as the primary institutional-grade blockchain,
suggesting long-term growth despite recent struggles. 

 RISK X LIQUID RESTAKING (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Liquid restaking protocols must allocate properly to AVSs, otherwise,
they risk slashing, liquidity constraints, and node operator reliance.
Diversification and regular reassessment of the AVS portfolio will
help prevent black swan events from occurring. EtherFi is working with
Chaos Labs to ensure a sensible and proper AVS delegation strategy. 

 PREVIOUS ISSUES WITH MASS ADOPTION (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DeFi, even when gamified, was too tedious and complex for regular
participants. NFTs were ugly and expensive, becoming more of a modern
talking piece than an actual utility. Memecoins hurt the space's
reputation. The two good use cases are prediction markets and DePIN,
as they enable easy adoption in areas that would otherwise not be
possible.
