MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BASE EXPLORES ISSUING NATIVE TOKEN (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Base creator Jesse Pollak announced at the BaseCamp event that the
Coinbase-backed L2 is exploring issuing a native token, marking a
reversal from the company's 2023 stance that it had no plans for
tokenization. Pollak emphasized that plans remain in early stages with
no timeline provided, and stressed that as a U.S. company, Base will
work closely with regulators on compliance for any token issuance and
distribution. The potential token announcement comes as Base has
emerged as the second-largest layer-2 by total value locked at $5
billion, with impressive usage metrics including 328 million
transactions over the past 30 days compared to Arbitrum's 77 million.
The exploration of tokenization could trigger increased activity on
Base as users attempt to position themselves for a potential airdrop,
similar to patterns seen with other major L2s. 

 ETHEREUM STABLECOIN SUPPLY HITS RECORD $166B (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ethereum's stablecoin supply has reached an all-time high of $166
billion, up from $149 billion just a month ago, further cementing its
role as DeFi's settlement backbone. USDT leads with $87.8B on
Ethereum, followed by USDC at $48B, signaling increasing institutional
adoption. Analysts say the record supply highlights Ethereum's growing
liquidity depth, resilience to macro volatility, and potential
tailwinds for ETH price appreciation.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GUILLOTINE: THE ULTRAFAST EVM IMPLEMENTATION (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Guillotine is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation
written in Zig that claims to compete for the fastest EVM ever built
while achieving significant size optimizations down to 110kb wasm
size, representing a 4x improvement over existing options. The
interpreter features data-oriented design with microoptimizations
including bytecode preanalysis, instruction fusion, and tailcall
recursion to maximize CPU branch prediction and minimize memory
footprint, enabling universal compatibility across programming
languages from Python to Swift to Rust. Guillotine represents Tevm's
mission to enable Ethereum to run everywhere without compromises,
utilizing techniques studied from various EVMs, including Ethereum.js,
Evmone, Geth, and Revm, for differential testing. The project is
currently in early alpha and released under the MIT license. 

 AMERICAN EXPRESS INTRODUCES BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ‘TRAVEL STAMPS' (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 American Express' "travel stamps," part of its revamped travel app,
allow customers to create commemorative records of travel experiences
through ERC-721 tokens minted and stored on Coinbase's Base network.
The digital passport stamps, which can be collected whenever travelers
use their Amex card, are technically NFTs, but are deliberately not
branded as such, as the company wanted to speak to the travel
experience naturally rather than emphasize the blockchain technology.
The stamps are not tradable tokens and don't function as
blockchain-based loyalty points currently. They could create
interesting partnership angles over time as identifiers and
representations of travel history.

confusing interfaces, trust issues, and poor support. Ubiquity

 A GUIDE TO THE COINBASE LISTING PROCESS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Coinbase operates a free, merit-based digital asset listing process
that begins with project teams submitting comprehensive applications,
including whitepapers, team backgrounds, tokenomics details, source
code links, block explorers, and third-party audit reports. The
evaluation involves a business assessment examining market demand,
community traction, and technical integration requirements, followed
by a core review where legal, compliance, and technical security teams
evaluate regulatory alignment and platform security compatibility.
Upon approval, assets undergo a phased market launch starting with
deposit-only periods to build liquidity, progressing through auction
phases for price discovery, and culminating in full trading
availability. Evaluation timelines vary significantly based on asset
complexity and application completeness, with thorough submissions
potentially expediting the review process. The structured approach
emphasizes regulatory compliance and security standards while
providing projects access to Coinbase's global user base and
institutional-grade platform infrastructure. 

 AAVE DAO'S STATE OF THE UNION (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Aave came back from the depths of the 2022 DeFi collapse to become
the dominant onchain lending protocol. Today, Aave manages over $60B
in TVL, generates $130M in annual revenue, and controls nearly 74% of
the lending market. The DAO is phasing out underperforming L2
deployments and “friendly forks,” while doubling down on its
stablecoin GHO, buybacks, and strategic growth deals. With its
financial strength and sharpened focus, Aave aims to cement its
position as the definitive leader in decentralized finance.

 PROTOCOL RETURNS STILL OUTPACED BY ISSUANCE COSTS (2 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Protocols like Aerodrome return funds to token holders, but the cost
of new token issuance still exceeds these returns. This means token
holders are effectively losing money for now, which is reasonable if
treated as a growth bet, but not to be confused with actual
profitability. 

 WHERE THE SEI OPPORTUNITIES ARE (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Sei Network's TVL surged from $411M in April to $609M by June, with a
sharp increase in active addresses. The ecosystem centers around a
"liquidity triangle" of three anchor protocols: DragonSwap offering
30-70% APY on SEI-USDC pools, Yei Finance controlling 44% of Sei's TVL
as the dominant money market with 9-12% borrow rates, and Splashing
providing liquid staking with $25.5M TVL and 7-9% native yields plus
MEV rewards. Institutional momentum is building through the SEC's
formal acknowledgment of a Canary Staked SEI ETF filing and Chainlink
Data Streams integration, delivering US Department of Commerce GDP
data to Sei's infrastructure. Performance metrics show that Sei
processes 200x more throughput than Solana and 5x more than Sui, with
$5.5B daily stablecoin volume and $1.53B DEX volume in July.
