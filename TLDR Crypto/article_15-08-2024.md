GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO MAKE HIGH YIELD IN DEFI (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Pendle PTs are zero-coupon DeFi bonds that offer a stable rate.
MakerDAO's DAI Savings Rate is largely considered to be the risk-free
rate of DeFi at 7%. Liquidity Provision earns trading fees and
protocol incentives and can be done in a delta-neutral way to mitigate
impermanent loss. A riskier strategy is yield looping, where assets
are borrowed and lent multiple times. 

 OLYMPUSDAO BUYBACKS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OlympusDAO has introduced a leveraged buyback-and-burn program for
$OHM, utilizing yield from its $181M treasury to repurchase $83K of
$OHM weekly. By borrowing against its own backing, this means a $1
buyback actually acts like $5, making the buybacks much more powerful
and helping to boost the value of $OHM while reducing the supply.
