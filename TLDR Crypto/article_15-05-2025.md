MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC DELAYS SOLANA AND DOGECOIN ETF PROPOSALS (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The SEC has delayed its decision on in-kind redemptions for
BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF and is soliciting public comments on
amendments to its creation and redemption process. Previously, the
agency had preferred a cash-only model requiring the immediate sale of
bitcoin upon redemption. Concurrently, the SEC postponed proposals for
the Grayscale Litecoin and Solana Trusts and opened comment periods
for the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. 

 NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS WANTS LONG-TERM VALUE WITH CRYPTO, NOT TO CHASE
'MEMES' (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mayor Eric Adams announced a focus on sustainable, long-term value
from crypto and blockchain for New Yorkers rather than chasing
fleeting memes and trends. He and city CTO Matt Fraser will host NYC's
inaugural crypto summit on May 20 to drive industry collaboration and
growth. Fraser emphasized blockchain's potential to democratize access
to public records like birth and death certificates.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SAFE + TOKEN WARRANT LAUNCH (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 MetaLeX now supports SAFE plus token warrants fundraising directly
onchain, which lets founders raise equity with optional token upside,
a method favored by VCs like a16z. Investors receive NFT-based
certified securities with a tradeability toggle, enabling secure,
composable deal execution without Docusign or off-chain fund
wrangling. 

 COLUMN LAUNCHES REAL-TIME PAYMENTS VIA FEDNOW AND RTP NETWORKS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Column has rolled out real-time payments across both the Federal
Reserve's FedNow Service and The Clearing House's RTP network,
enabling 24/7/365 instant transfers that settle in seconds. These
rails support high-value, final, and irrevocable transactions cheaper
than wires and faster than ACH, accessible through the same account
and routing numbers. With over 1,600 U.S. banks now supporting these
rails, Column reports it is already the largest real-time payments
transactor in the country.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO BENCHMARK YOUR PORTFOLIO (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto investors routinely deceive themselves by rounding returns,
ignoring fees, and molding data to feel successful, making thorough
record-keeping and predefined KPIs essential. Measuring performance
against proper benchmarks like BTC and SPY and risk-adjusted metrics
like the Sharpe ratio is vital to reveal actual performance. Investors
can avoid emotional biases by setting honest risk premiums, factoring
in probabilities of various losses, and separating portfolio logs from
net-worth tracking. 

 PRINCIPLES OF EIP STEWARDSHIP (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 13 months of EIP 5792 development led to five principles: ship
prototypes early, persist through reviews, engage stakeholders,
cultivate champions, and make decisive progress. For 5792
specifically, showcasing early demos of batch and sponsored RPC
methods secured support from MetaMask, Ambire, and first-party
viem/wagmi libraries within weeks. Iterative stakeholder feedback
(e.g., adding EOA support) and champion advocacy (e.g., jxom's
viem/wagmi integration) amplified adoption.

 CryptoPunks has been acquired by the Infinite Node Foundation, a
