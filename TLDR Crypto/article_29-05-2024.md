 GNOSIS PAY PARTNERS VISA TO CONNECT WEB3 ECOSYSTEMS WITH TRADITIONAL
PAYMENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Gnosis Pay has partnered with Visa to connect Safe self-custody smart
accounts to Visa debit cards. This card will allow users to spend an

 EU THREATENS TO REGULATE MEV AS ‚ÄòMARKET ABUSE' (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A draft of the EU's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations
describes MEV as a type of market abuse as it allows a validator to
front-run transactions to make a profit. If passed, EU-based crypto
organizations would be required to detect and report MEV. Two weeks
ago, the U.S. Department of Justice appeared to distinguish between
acceptable MEV and market abuse in an indictment over MEV bot fraud.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 MAPLE FINANCE UNVEILS SYRUP YIELD PLATFORM (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Maple Finance has introduced a new DeFi platform called Syrup that
offers a 15% yield on USDC deposits. Maple is also introducing a
rewards token called SYRUP that aims to improve yield by supplying
additional "Drips" for loyalty. Maple's goal is to merge
institutional-grade yields with DeFi to make these yields more
accessible. 

 INTRODUCING THE ENS L2 (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ENS Labs is proposing expanding to a Layer 2 network and renaming
itself ENSv2. This proposal promises to further decentralize and
enhance ENS' utility and flexibility beyond Ethereum mainnet's
limitations. ENSv2 will reduce gas costs, increase transaction speeds,
and introduce a hierarchical registry for .eth names, offering more
customization and better multi-chain interoperability.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ZERO KNOWLEDGE VS. OPTIMISTIC ROLLUPS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This discussion explains the evolution of L2 solutions, emphasizing
zkSync's approach, which uses zk proofs for scalability and security.
It contrasts zkSync's potential with the limitations of optimistic
rollups, arguing that zkSync's ability to provide seamless, trustless
interactions between different systems makes it superior for scaling
horizontally without compromises. 

 ADVICE FOR BUILDERS SEEKING GRANTS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There are various types of grants, each aiming for a unique
objective, and builders should know the difference. Each grant
provider has a need they want to fulfill, such as the Ethereum
Foundation's focus on public goods or an L2 emphasizing ecosystem
growth. When writing the grant, explain the ‚Äòwhy' behind your need
for money, make it easy for the reviewer, showcase value, and get
feedback.

 MODULAR THESIS COMEBACK (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Despite recent negative sentiment, the Celestia ecosystem is gaining
renewed momentum, with significant incoming developments including
high-profile project launches, the implementation of ZK accounts for
secure bridging, and growing adoption among Ethereum and Bitcoin L2s
all signaling a strong comeback for the modular thesis. 

 HIGH FDV IS NOT INHERENTLY BAD (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 High Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) is criticized in crypto projects
when they launch to retail investors at prices significantly higher
than those offered in private rounds, often leading to dissatisfaction
and sell-offs. CoinList contrasts this by offering retail investors
terms comparable to or better than those available to VCs, resulting
in lower premiums and potentially more stable post-launch performance,
exemplifying a more equitable approach for retail investors in token
launches.
