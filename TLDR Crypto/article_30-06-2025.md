MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SOUTH KOREA BACKS KOREAN WON STABLECOINS AS STRATEGIC PRIORITY (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Newly elected President Lee Jae Myung has made Korean won–based
stablecoins a national priority, aiming to reduce capital outflows and
improve monetary independence. Proposed legislation would lift the ban
on won-backed stablecoins, create a licensing regime, and promote
usage across industries like gaming and e-commerce. While critics
argue the won lacks global demand and risks becoming a proxy-CBDC,
supporters say there's real utility for cross-border trade and digital
Korean services. 

 BOLT EMBRACES STABLECOIN PAYMENTS FOR GLOBAL MARKETPLACES (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Bolt, a San Francisco-based payments platform, has introduced
stablecoin payment support through its new Bolt Connect product,
aiming to streamline cross-border transactions for merchants and
marketplaces. This integration allows for faster settlements and
reduced transaction costs by minimizing reliance on traditional
banking intermediaries. Consumers benefit from instant payments
without incurring foreign transaction fees.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 REX-OSPREY TO LAUNCH SOLANA, ETHEREUM STAKING ETFS (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 REX Shares and Osprey Funds received SEC sign-off on June 28,
clearing the launch of two C-corporation ETFs – ESK for Ethereum and
SSK for Solana – that will both track spot prices and distribute
onchain staking rewards to holders. By electing C-corp status, these
funds will internally tax staking distributions before paying them out
as dividends, charging a 0.75% management fee. US spot Ethereum ETFs
have traded for nearly a year and only futures-based Solana ETFs exist
today. Both products will list on Cboe BZX, using this legal
workaround to expedite the availability of staking-yield ETFs. 

 REPUBLIC INTRODUCES MIRROR TOKENS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Republic is launching Mirror Tokens to give retail investors economic
exposure to private companies' future valuation events for as little
as $50 via Apple Pay or stablecoins. The tokens aren't equity but
track performance based on predefined triggers, using secondary-market
data to set initial pricing, and are subject to a $5,000 purchase cap
under US exemptions. After a lock-up period, holders will be able to
trade on a regulated secondary marketplace. Built on Solana for
low-cost, global accessibility, the Mirror Token framework will start
with SpaceX and soon expand to firms like xAI, Ramp, and Perplexity,
opening private-market opportunities to everyday investors.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING THE STABLECOIN BANKING STACK (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This early framework outlines the essential services needed to bring
stablecoins into mainstream finance. It includes identity-linked
wallets for compliance, crypto-to-fiat conversion rails for domestic
and cross-border payments (e.g. FedNow and SEPA), card payments with
fraud prevention, and yield-bearing savings accounts integrated with
lenders or DeFi protocols. The stack aims to mirror legacy banking
(accounts, cards, and savings), but with stablecoins at the core,
unlocking faster, cheaper, and more programmable financial services. 

 WHY CRYPTO + MARKET OUTLOOK FOR 2025 (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Crypto embodies the native financial layer of the internet, offering
ownership, composable financial tools, and a meritocratic attention
economy that aligns with Gen Z's values and need for new
wealth-generation paradigms. Sustainable success in crypto comes from
deep due diligence, clear theses, and patient accumulation. There is a
bullish macro outlook driven by anticipated Fed rate cuts and dollar
weakness. This author's high-conviction positions include
revenue-yielding protocols (SYRUP, EULER, and Pendle), cycle winners
like HYPE, and infrastructure bets on Solana and its ecosystem.

 TELEGRAM IS LOSING THE MINIAPPS BATTLE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Despite having a billion users and the TON blockchain, Telegram is
losing the miniapps battle to Farcaster due to systemic issues
including millions of botted users, copy-paste projects with no real
impact, and a February 2025 mandate requiring all miniapps to
integrate TON blockchain, which caused significant developer backlash.
A report revealed TON's declining ecosystem metrics, while builders
are increasingly migrating to Farcaster which offers real users
instead of bot armies, quick iteration cycles, and multi-chain support
from Solana, Celo, and Monad. Farcaster is prioritizing sustainable
ecosystem development over quick wins. 

 POLYGON TARGETS 5,000 TPS BY YEAR-END (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Polygon's new “Gigagas Roadmap” outlines aggressive scaling
targets: 1,000 TPS and ~5s finality by July, ramping to 5,000+ TPS and
1s block times by year-end. Key upgrades include the Bhilai hardfork
and Heimdall v2, both live on testnet and slated for mainnet
deployment in July. Long term, Polygon plans to deepen integration
with its Agglayer architecture and push for institutional adoption,
positioning PoS as a high-performance, low-latency chain.
