MARKETS & BUSINESS

 $19 TRILLION IN TRANSACTIONS SETTLED ON THE BITCOIN NETWORK IN 2024
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin's network activity doubled in 2024 as it processed $19
trillion in transactions compared to 2023's $8.7 trillion. The network
also achieved a record hashrate of 1,000 EH/s in early 2025, with
US-based mining pools controlling 40% of the global hashrate. Chinese
pools maintain majority control. 

 TETHER'S MARKET CAP SHEDS $3 BILLION AS EUROPE'S MICA REGULATIONS
TAKE EFFECT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tether's market capitalization has dropped to $137 billion, its
largest decline since the FTX crash, as the European Union's Markets
in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations took full effect on December 30.
The decline coincides with European exchanges delisting USDT due to
compliance concerns, though other factors like broader market dynamics
likely played a role in the market cap drop. Despite controlling 68%
of global stablecoin volume, Tether faces scrutiny under MiCA, which
requires stablecoin issuers to maintain adequate reserves and meet
strict transparency requirements.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ANON.WORLD: FULLY ANONYMOUS SOCIAL PLATFORM ON FARCASTER (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Anon.World is an anonymous social network with a Reddit-like UX. It
is based on AnonCast, a protocol for ZK-enabled private posting, and
adds in additional capabilities like communities and replies. Users
can get credentials proving information about their wallet, like how
many ANON tokens they hold. The native app will be launching in a few
weeks. 

 ETHENA'S 2025 ROADMAP RELEASED (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ethena's ENA token surged 34% following the release of its 2025
roadmap, which includes plans to launch iUSDe, a TradFi-focused
stablecoin with a 10% yield, and integrate staked USDe (sUSDe) into
Telegram's 900 million-user platform for payments and savings. These
moves aim to connect decentralized and centralized finance with
traditional markets, targeting both fixed-income investors and
everyday consumers.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 REAL CODE FOR REAL DAGI (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This guide to decentralized Autonomous General Intelligence (dAGI)
emphasizes Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for ensuring secure,
private, and verifiable AI operations across the entire stack. It also
explains novel concepts like AI swarms, where agents autonomously
create and manage tokens while operating within TEE-secured
environments. Phala's framework uses a decentralized GPU network for
training, monetized data collection mechanisms, and confidential AI
inference capabilities. 

 PRECONFIRMATION FOR THE AVERAGE JOE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Preconfirmations, a new Ethereum feature aimed at improving
transaction speed and reliability, allows users to pay extra for
instant confirmations backed by economic guarantees from gateways and
validators. Future wallet integrations could offer subscription models
for faster transactions, better slippage control, and gas sponsorship,
signaling a leap forward in Ethereum's user experience.

 IRS' NEW DEFI REGULATIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The IRS has released a new ruleset for DeFi trading platforms that

are three layers in the DeFi stack: the user interface, the
application layer that executes transactions, and the blockchain
settlement layer. The interface layer, like the Uniswap webapp, will
be treated as brokers and required to collect KYC information, track
transactions, and report to the IRS and customers starting in 2027.
