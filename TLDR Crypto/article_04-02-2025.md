 DIAGNOSING PROBLEMS WITH COINBASE'S RISK MODEL, $300M A YEAR LOST TO
SCAMS (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Coinbase users have lost over $65M in just two months to social
engineering scams, largely because aggressive risk models fail to
prevent sophisticated phishing attacks that exploit personal data and
spoof Coinbase communications. While Coinbase has made significant
contributions to crypto adoption, critics argue that its inadequate
response to theft reports, lack of real-time security interventions,
and failure to pursue legal action against known scammers leave users
vulnerable compared to competitors like Kraken, OKX, and Binance.

KYBERSWAP, INDEXED FINANCE, REMAINS AT LARGE (2 MINUTE READ) [11]

money laundering, for allegedly stealing $65 million through exploits
of two DeFi protocols: $48.8 million from KyberSwap in November 2023
and $16.5 million from Indexed Finance in 2021. The hacker demanded
control over the Kyber platform, including its governance mechanism,
in exchange for returning the funds. Medjedovic, who remains at large,
faces charges of wire fraud, computer hacking, attempted extortion,
and money laundering.
