 SOLANA & JITO EXECS NAMED IN EXPANDED RICO SUIT OVER PUMP.FUN (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Burwick Law and Wolf Popper have amended their RICO lawsuit against
Pump.fun to include the Solana Foundation, Solana Labs, Jito Labs, and
multiple executives, including Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal,
accusing them of facilitating an illegal digital gambling and money
transmission enterprise. The complaint alleges violations of AML laws,
the Bank Secrecy Act, and claims Pump enabled the laundering of stolen
Bybit funds by the Lazarus Group. Plaintiffs claim Pump has generated
$723 million from a system they liken to a “digital slot machine,”
while Jito is accused of frontrunning winning trades via MEV. 

 NINTH CIRCUIT RULES NFTS CAN BE TRADEMARKED (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that NFTs like Yuga Labs' Bored Ape
Yacht Club qualify as “goods” eligible for trademark protection
under the Lanham Act, a landmark win for NFT IP rights. However, it
vacated the $9M judgment against artist Ryder Ripps and ordered a
trial to determine whether consumers were actually confused by his
RR/BAYC project, leaving the case far from over.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 TELEGRAM CRYPTO WALLET GOES LIVE FOR 87M USERS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Telegram has officially launched its built-in, self-custodial TON
Wallet to U.S. users, enabling seamless crypto transfers, swaps, and
purchases directly within the app. Already adopted by 100M+ users
globally, the wallet offers a user-friendly experience with features
like stablecoin support, MoonPay-powered fiat ramps, and access to
Telegram's Mini App ecosystem. This positions it as a serious
contender to platforms like Cash App and Coinbase. 

 TETHER PREPS U.S. INSTITUTIONAL PUSH POST-GENIUS ACT (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino says the company's U.S. expansion is “well
underway” as it readies a new stablecoin tailored for institutional
clients seeking faster settlements. The move follows the signing of
the GENIUS Act, which mandates full USD backing and annual audits for
large stablecoin issuers. While acknowledging that U.S. banks may
initially have an edge, Ardoino said Tether's tech stack and market
experience remain superior and ruled out any plans for a public
listing like Circle.

 BEST STABLECOIN YIELDS ISSUE #13 (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This week's top stablecoin vaults include HyperBeat's USDT strategy
on Hyperliquid at 15-35% APR and Euler's FalconStable at 35-60% APR,
while ResolvLabs' RLP vault returns 27% APR (≈97% when leveraged).
Avalanche stablecoins on Euler yield 47-96% APR, and BlackholeDex's
ve(3,3) pools pay 30-70% APR. Other notable opportunities are Merkl's
28% APR for lending USDS, Plume's 20% APR vaults, and Gauntlet USD
Alpha's 12% APY on USDC. 

 THE ROLEX INDICATOR (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The “Rolex Indicator” tracks luxury watch prices and shows that
true speculative euphoria often arrives late in crypto cycles, when
new wealth starts flashing status symbols in the real world. In 2021,
watch prices only really spiked after Bitcoin's second ATH and NFT
mania, then crashed alongside crypto. Today, Rolex premiums remain
muted despite near-record Bitcoin highs, suggesting we're in the
middle rather than at the top of the cycle. When we finally see
watches selling at 2x retail and countless wrist‐shots on social
media, that's likely the late‐cycle signal.

 WHY TWITTER IS LYING ABOUT TOKEN LAUNCHES (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Crypto Twitter's favorite playbook – buying engagement, launching
tiny floats, touting massive VC raises, and front-loading hype –
simply doesn't move prices. Analysis of 50,000 data points from 40
major 2025 token launches shows near-zero correlation between Twitter
metrics, initial circulating-supply percentages, or fundraising size
and post-launch returns. The one statistically significant driver is
Initial Market Cap, as larger IMCs predict weaker performance. The
best predictors of success are realistic launch valuations, genuine
product utility, authentic ongoing communication, and strong volume
retention after the initial pump. 

 HOW HYPERLIQUID BREAKS WALL STREET'S GAME (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Hyperliquid's HIP-3 and “Hyperps” introduce on-chain perpetual
futures for pre-IPO private companies, creating a transparent, 24/7
market where anyone can trade valuations of firms like Stripe or
OpenAI months before their IPO. By surfacing real-time price discovery
and order flow, these permissionless markets undercut the traditional
investment-bank book-building cartel that underprices shares by 20-40%
and locks out retail until day one. With oracleless pricing and
time-weighted funding mechanisms, Hyperps collapse the artificial
private-public divide, democratize access to early growth, and strip
away the “legalized front-running” banks have long enjoyed. While
regulatory hurdles and initial liquidity constraints remain,
Hyperliquid's approach promises to dismantle decades of IPO
rent-extraction and usher in genuinely free capital markets.
