 A report by VanEck reveals that approximately $175 billion worth of
bitcoin is held by ETFs, nations, and both public and private
companies, which makes up about 15% of the total Bitcoin supply. This
holding demonstrates increasing institutional interest and acceptance
of bitcoin as a viable store of value, with more involvement from
hedge funds, asset managers, and endowments.

 HOW REDSTONE WILL CHANGE THE GAME (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Redstone is an OP Stack Layer 2 and part of the Optimism Superchain
ecosystem that just went live. It was created by Lattice, the company
behind the MUD framework for building complex onchain apps centered
primarily around gaming and autonomous worlds. Over the next few
months, Redstone, which was made to realize MUD's potential, will
deploy several games, including onchain Minecraft, a multiplayer
real-time strategy game, a sci-fi horror, and the traditional suite of
DeFi products. 

 INTRODUCING AAVE 2030 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Aave V4 introduces the Unified Liquidity Layer, which allows for a
more flexible approach to managing liquidity that builds upon a base
layer while allowing modification at the module layer. It adjusts
interest rates and liquidity premiums based on market conditions and
collateral risk to provide fairer pricing for lenders and borrowers.
The ultimate goal is to create a chain-agnostic liquidity protocol
facilitating cross-chain liquidity and an expansion of its GHO
stablecoin. Aave is also rebranding with a new logo and design.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 SELL IN MAY & GO AWAY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Seasonality has a statistically significant impact on returns in both
traditional and crypto markets. Over the past five years, buying BTC
in October and selling in April netted 1,449%, while buying in May and
selling in September led to -29%. Retail and institutional sentiment
is waning this May, as evidenced by trading volume, volatility, and
ETF outflows. Macroeconomic conditions are also driving liquidity away
from all markets, which the Treasury could solve by injecting up to
$1.4 trillion of liquidity into risk assets. 

 UNISWAP: PRICE IMPROVEMENT WITH ORDER FLOW AUCTIONS (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Uniswap Labs has introduced a new methodology for evaluating price
improvements when using Order Flow Auctions (OFAs) and Automated
Market Makers (AMMs). It focuses on factors like liquidity access, gas
optimization, and priority fee settings. Uniswap Labs' initial
findings suggest that the Uniswap interface, when compared to other
major interfaces like 1inch, often provides better pricing for users,
especially in larger trades.

 HOW TO STAY PATIENT (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Value transfers from the impatient to the patient. Avoid opening
positions that represent less than 1% of your portfolio - focus
instead on higher-conviction allocations. Keep your lifestyle
insulated from the volatile movements of the market with alternative
cash flow streams. Remain focused on your individual investment goals,
not others', and do not act with extreme fear or greed. 

 ANALYSIS OF 18 PAST AIRDROPS (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The average ROI of 18 recent airdrops was about 15%, with 5.88% of
the token supply allocated to the drop. Jito and Juptier were the most
fair with 10% of the supply dedicated to the initial airdrop. Celestia
had the best ROI at over 300%, and PARCL had the worst at -60%.
EtherFi's post-drop sentiment was the highest in recent history, with
many others drawing criticism for their small allocations or
tokenomics.
