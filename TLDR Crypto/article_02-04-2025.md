MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE STAKING SUIT AXED IN THREE US STATES (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Coinbase's staking lawsuit has been dismissed in three U.S. states,
demonstrating a shift in regulatory momentum. The decision comes as
regulators recalibrate their approach to digital assets, marking a
notable win for Coinbase as it continues to expand its staking
services. 

 BINANCE ENDS TETHER USDT TRADING IN EUROPE TO COMPLY WITH MICA RULES
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Binance has paused spot trading pairs for Tether's USDT in the
European Economic Area (EEA) to comply with MiCA regulations. EEA
users can still custody USDT and trade it via perpetual contracts.
This move aligns with local regulatory requirements. Other exchanges,
like Kraken, have taken similar actions.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AI-INFUSED BLOCKCHAIN AMBIENT TO 'REPLACE BITCOIN,' SAYS CO-FOUNDER
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ambient is a blockchain that aims to deliver transparent,
decentralized, and cheap AI. It is ultimately designed to replace
Bitcoin and its aging encryption system, which could become obsolete
within five years and leave miners looking for a new proof-of-work
system. Miners in its network help guarantee reliable AI outputs
through its “verified inference” process, which will first power a
600B+ parameter model. 

 CHAINLINK PAYMENT ABSTRACTION IS NOW LIVE (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chainlink Payment Abstraction is now live on mainnet. It allows users
to pay for Chainlink services using various tokens that are
automatically converted into LINK using Chainlink Automation, Price
Feeds, and a DEX. The system will eventually channel these converted
fees to LINK stakers, streamlining node rewards and bolstering the
network's economic sustainability.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING SUSTAINABLE TOKENOMICS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sustainable tokenomics ensures that projects can properly navigate
market cycles and requires balanced distribution, controlled supply,
genuine utility, and active governance. Well-crafted token models
mitigate risks like inflation and misaligned incentives, setting the
stage for long-term growth. Comparing Jupiter's successful
community-first model to DYDX's design flaws illustrates that even
strong products can falter without sound tokenomics. 

 THE CASE FOR “OFF THE GRID'S” $GUN (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Off the Grid is an onchain game that demonstrates the potential of
robust, blockchain-based economies in modern gaming. With the steady
addition of tens of thousands of new players every day and continuous
game updates, it is poised to quickly become a top onchain app by
revenue and one of the few with true product-market fit. The $GUN
token model is meant to drive sustained revenue correlated with the
game's success and marketplace volumes.

 SOCIAL CURRENCIES ARE THE FUTURE OF MEMECOINS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Social currencies represent the next evolution of memecoins by
transforming fleeting hype into sustained, value-driven community
engagement. Unlike traditional memecoins that roughly monetize
virality and attention, social currencies are designed to continuously
generate trends, brand partnerships, and integrate into real-world
applications. Tokens will serve as both a cultural asset and a
long-term, productive investment vehicle, appealing to both retail and
institutional participants. 

 IP IS DEAD… (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Traditional IP enforcement is losing ground as the AI era fuels a
remix culture where derivative works reshape creative value. The
AI-generated Studio Ghibli phenomenon showcases how remixing can build
vibrant, community-owned creative universes without relying on
outdated legal battles. Instead of fighting over copyright, innovators
can use decentralized platforms like DreamNet to turn remixing into a
strategic asset that drives audience growth and monetization.
Ultimately, the future belongs to those who construct rich,
collaborative data ecosystems that redefine creative licensing. 

 CONSUMER MINDSET ON CORE PRODUCTS (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Mainstream consumers only care that their products work well. These
consumers appreciate faster, better, and cheaper services so crypto
founders should focus on familiar concepts rather than technical
jargon.
