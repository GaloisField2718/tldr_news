(5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/05/sec-sues-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao-for-us-securities-violations.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

The SEC has filed 13 charges against the world's largest crypto
exchange, Binance, and its founder CZ. The SEC alleges that Binance
has violated securities laws, commingled billions in user funds,
purposefully worked to attract US customers to its unregulated
international exchange, and included some extremely incriminating
statements made by Binance officials in the lawsuit. Additionally, the
SEC accused Binance of operating market-making companies to inflate
trading prices. Binance claimed to have been cooperating with
regulators and pledged to continue to for the investigation. The suit
also alleged that several leading altcoins, such as Solana, Polygon,
BNB, Cardano, and others, are classified as securities, causing crypto
markets to tumble yesterday.

READ) [https://archive.ph/EiQ3I?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

JPMorgan is partnering with six major Indian banks to pilot a
blockchain platform for interbank dollar transactions in the Gujarat
International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City). The platform will leverage
JPMorgan's Onyx blockchain solution to enable instant, round-the-clock
settlements allowing GIFT City banks to operate effectively on their
own time zones. This initiative supports New Delhi's efforts to
establish GIFT City as an international financial center, competing
with Singapore and Dubai.

CURVEâ€™S STABLECOIN TO SUPPORT LIDOâ€™S STETH (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://thedefiant.io/curve-s-stablecoin-to-support-lido-s-steth?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

Curve holders have voted to include Lido's liquid staking token,
stETH, as a collateral alternative for Curve's new stablecoin, crvUSD.
This development will increase the crvUSD debt ceiling by 15 times to
$150M. If this new limit is reached, crvUSD would become the 13th
largest stablecoin. The addition of stETH will allow more liquid
staking token holders to utilize their position in DeFi with crvUSD.
The vote also increases the limit on PegKeepers pools, a system that
helps maintain crvUSD's stable value. 

A METRIC TO EVALUATE LP COMPETITIVENESS IN AMMS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.uniswap.org/metric-evaluate-lp-competitiveness-amm?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

Uniswap has introduced a new metric called fee liquidity-adjusted
instantaneous returns (FLAIR) to gauge the performance of LPs in AMM
pools. FLAIR takes into account the intra-pool competitiveness,
considering factors like timing of liquidity deployment and
rebalancing of in-range liquidity. It also helps LPs measure
historical performance and strategize future capital deployments.
While it's applicable to Uniswap's protocol, it can also be adjusted
for traditional exchanges, offering a comparative tool to understand
various market structures.

CRYPTO BASICS SERIES: DEX AGGREGATOR BASICS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://banklessdao.mirror.xyz/4TlES9LhRaOPQLNRRm3eYkr6OI6FIEoUrK4XJxhWkBU?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

This article likens DEX aggregators to hotel search engines - tools to
find the best deals across multiple DEXs. They monitor numerous
liquidity sources using algorithms to determine the most beneficial
rates and least slippage, saving users what might otherwise be lost in
transactions due to high slippage or suboptimal exchange rates. Some
aggregators may even split trades across several exchanges to maximize
conditions. Prominent examples of DEX aggregators include 1inch and
Paraswap. In the future, DEX aggregators will likely become an
integral part of wallets, enhancing their functionality as we have
already seen with larger wallets like MetaMask. 

A BREAKDOWN OF THE PROPOSED MARKET STRUCTURE BILL (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1665693527735517184.html]

The proposed crypto bill aims to integrate crypto regulation into the
existing US financial regulatory landscape, allowing tokens and
related intermediaries to be simultaneously regulated by the CFTC and
SEC. In this framework, tokens would sometimes be regulated as
securities and sometimes as commodities. For example, insider tokens
would be treated as securities with a 12-month lockup period, and
could be sold on SEC-registered platforms. The bill also provides a
clear securities law exemption for end user distributions. Potential
downsides include fragmented markets, SEC authority over crypto
projects, possible lack of liquidity for insiders, and a dual
regulatory regime.

SEC COMPLAINT AIMS TO UNILATERALLY DEFINE CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE (3
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

In its own statement, Binance expressed disappointment over the SEC's
lawsuit, stating that it has cooperated fully during investigations
and attempted to address the SEC's concerns. The crypto exchange feels
that the SEC's approach lacks clarity for the digital asset industry,
and unilaterally labeling tokens as securities complicates matters
further. Binance refuted allegations that user assets on its platform
were at risk, assuring that all assets are secure. It criticized the
SEC's apparent intent to make headlines rather than protect investors
and claimed that the agency was hindering innovation in the US with
its enforcement actions. Despite the lawsuit, Binance stated that it
remains committed to cooperating with regulators and fighting the
SEC's perceived overreach. 

VC FUNDING OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1665677393284194304.html]

In May, there were 120 crypto venture deals that raised a total of
$1.2B, down from the previous monthâ€™s count of 130 deals. While the
raw numbers showed declines, it was still promising to see projects
securing funding during the bear market. Three of the projects that
raised in May include zkLink, a multichain trading layer for DeFi &
NFTs; Dolomite, a next-gen money market and margin trading platform;
and Hourglass, a marketplace for trading time-bound tokens.
