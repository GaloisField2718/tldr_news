MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES FACE CLAIMS OF LIQUIDATION UNDERCOUNTS (5
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Hyperliquid CEO Jeff Yan and crypto data platform CoinGlass alleged
that centralized exchanges like Binance significantly undercount
liquidations due to their reporting methodology, which only captures
one liquidation per second in order snapshot streams despite
processing over 100 liquidations per pair per second during mass
events. The claims emerged after Friday's market crash produced the
largest liquidation event in crypto history at $16.7 billion in long
liquidations, though Yan suggested actual figures could be 100x
higher. Binance faced multiple technical issues during the crash,
including module lags, depegging events requiring over $280 million in
user compensation, and display anomalies showing $0 prices for some
trading pairs, while the platform's CEO acknowledged "brief lags" in
some functional modules. In contrast, DeFi platforms demonstrated
greater resilience, with Hyperliquid reporting zero downtime and
Ethena's USDe stablecoin maintaining its peg on Curve while depegging
severely to under $0.70 on Binance. 

 TRADER WHO MADE $192M SHORTING THE CRASH IS SHORT AGAIN (6 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The wallet identified as 0xb317 on Hyperliquid has opened a new $163
million short position on Bitcoin with 10x leverage and $125,500
liquidation level, already showing $3.5 million profit as the same
trader who gained nearly $200 million by shorting 30 minutes before
Trump's surprise 100% China tariff announcement that triggered the
largest-ever crypto liquidation day. The perfectly timed initial bet
sparked widespread speculation about insider knowledge and earned the
address the "insider whale" designation from onchain analysts, with
some arguing the position itself accelerated the crash that erased
over $19 billion in crypto market value. Hyperliquid's
Auto-Deleveraging mechanism hit over 6,000 wallets and wiped $1.2
billion in trader capital during the weekend flush, forcibly closing
profitable positions to cover losses from bankrupt accounts and
preventing bad debt but potentially worsening selloffs as the safety
mechanism rebalances the system.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING ONCHAIN STOREFRONTS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Rarible has launched onchain storefronts, enabling brands and
creators to own their presence with fully branded spaces for launching
and selling digital collectibles, with VeeFriends as the first
implementation, bringing Gary Vaynerchuk's 250+ character universe
together in one hub. The VeeFriends storefront integrates Privy wallet
for email login onboarding, Crossmint checkout for credit card, Apple
Pay, and Google Pay payments, and RARI Foundation rewards program for
trading and collecting activity, combining digital assets, collector
spotlights, and media features in a unified commerce experience. The
platform positions itself as "Shopify, but onchain" for storytelling,
discovery, and community building beyond basic marketplace
functionality, with more major brands and creators preparing to launch
their own storefronts as the next chapter of onchain commerce takes
shape. 

 ENSV2 OVERVIEW (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ENSv2 introduces hierarchical registries where each name provides its
own registry implementation for subnames rather than ENSv1's single
flat registry, giving name owners direct control over ownership and
transfer rules while enabling entire subtrees to be deleted or
reassigned in single operations. Changes include native Layer 2
support with Namechain and cross-chain resolution built on CCIP-Read,
contract factories where every name gets its own resolver and registry
rather than relying on large multi-user contracts enabled by low L2
transaction costs, role-based permissions integrating Name Wrapper
functionality into the core protocol, and elimination of grace periods
where names immediately enter premium periods upon expiration. The
hierarchical structure enables advanced features like aliasing
multiple domains to identical records by reusing the same subregistry
across names, while standardized registries implement ERC1155 tokens
with sophisticated permissions models using Open Zeppelin-style roles,
where each name has roles like resolver setting with corresponding
admin roles for granting or revoking permissions.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 INSIDE CRYPTO'S $19B LIQUIDATION CASCADE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trump's 100% tariff announcement triggered a $19B crypto liquidation
spiral because of leverage and structural flaws in exchange
infrastructure. Binance's margin engine mispriced wrapped assets like
wBETH and BNSOL, marking collateral to distressed spot prices instead
of underlying value. As liquidity vanished, auto-liquidations fed a
self-reinforcing doom loop while market makers pulled back, unable to
hedge. Synthetic assets like USDe remained solvent but were liquidated
anyway because of faulty pricing logic. 

 “DEPEG-GATE” AND THE SEMANTICS OF STABLECOIN STABILITY (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 “Depeg” has become an overused, misleading label for any price
dislocation, even when the stablecoin issuer isn't at fault. We should
recognize the nuances between local depegs (venue-level liquidity or
routing issues like USDe's recent event), widespread redemption stress
(temporary withdrawal uncertainty like USDC during SVB), and
collateral loss (true issuer failure like Terra/Luna). Most
“depegs” reflect market dysfunction, not issuer collapse, and
using the term loosely conflates unrelated issues, causing unnecessary
reputational damage.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LESSONS FROM BINANCE'S DEPEG CHAOS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Exchanges must margin collateral based on their own liquidity and
solvency, not global parity, just as commodities trade differently
across local markets like Dalian or Chicago. While Ethena's USDe
remained solvent, Binance couldn't assume recovery without taking
market risk. The episode demonstrates that DeFi and cross-chain
systems depend on local liquidity realities, and oracles tied to
mainnet prices may not reflect true collateral value on frontier
chains or isolated venues, a challenge that extends to tokenized RWAs
as well. 

 THE MORAL FOUNDATIONS OF CRYPTO NETWORKS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Enduring crypto networks succeed because they're built on moral
conviction, not convenience. Bitcoin stands for separating money from
the state, Ethereum for decentralization, and Zcash for privacy.
Similarly, Base's mantra, “Base is for everyone”, reflects a
mission to build an open, global economy rather than chase speculative
profits. Moral values impose real tradeoffs like Bitcoin sacrifices
speed, Ethereum scalability, and Base short-term revenue. However,
these principled constraints, guided by founder-led vision, are what
ultimately enable networks to evolve into true network states.
