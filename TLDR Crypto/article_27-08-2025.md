Non-BTC/ETH (and maybe SOL) digital asset treasuries are “dead on
arrival” if their only pitch is speed to market and premium
trading. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TRUMP MEDIA, CRYPTO.COM SPIN OUT TOKEN SPAC (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Trump Media and Technology Group has partnered with Crypto.com and a
SPAC to launch a crypto treasury firm focused on stockpiling
Crypto.com's native CRO token, following the MicroStrategy playbook of
using public companies as digital asset investment vehicles. The deal
involves Crypto.com transferring 684 million CRO tokens worth
approximately $105 million, representing roughly 20% of CRO's total
outstanding supply, to Trump Media in exchange for equity and cash.
Markets responded positively with CRO surging 35% and Trump Media
stock rising 10% on the announcement, reflecting investor appetite for
crypto treasury strategies amid the Trump administration's
crypto-friendly stance. 

 ETHEREUM DEFI LAGS BEHIND, EVEN DURING ETH ATHS (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Despite Ethereum reaching a new all-time high of $4,946, DeFi total
value locked (TVL) remains at $91 billion, significantly below the
$108 billion peak from November 2021, with only 21 million ETH locked
compared to 29.2 million ETH during the previous cycle. The current
ETH rally is primarily driven by institutional inflows through ETFs
rather than retail DeFi activity that fueled previous cycles.
Structural changes, including Layer 2 migration, more
capital-efficient protocols like liquid staking, and increased
competition from other chains, have fundamentally altered Ethereum's
TVL dynamics.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ARBITRUM PARTNERS WITH SUCCINCT TO ADD ZK PROVING (3 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Succinct has partnered with Offchain Labs' Tandem arm to integrate ZK
proving into the Arbitrum stack, giving its 40+ chains the option to
become ZK rollups. For users, this means withdrawals and settlements
shrink from 7 days to minutes, improving capital efficiency, bridge
UX, and security through L1-enforced proofs. For the ecosystem, it
enables hybrid optimistic/ZK paths and modular flexibility without
stack rewrites, while expanding Succinct's SP1 zkVM and PROVE token
network to one of the largest L2 ecosystems. 

 NOUS RELEASES HERMES 4 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nous Research, a frontier AI lab using crypto for the coordination of
compute resources, has launched Hermes 4, a new line of hybrid
reasoning models designed to be uncensored and user-aligned while
maintaining state-of-the-art performance in mathematics, coding, and
reasoning. The company also introduced RefusalBench, a new benchmark
testing models' willingness to be helpful across scenarios typically
restricted by other AI systems. Hermes 4 achieves superior performance
against both open and closed models in operating without censorship.
Nous Research is offering free inference access through its revamped
chat interface for the first week, along with a comprehensive
technical report that sets new transparency standards for AI model
benchmarking. Hermes 4 supports the crypto community's need for
unconstrained analytical and development tools.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STABLECOIN INFRASTRUCTURE WARS (28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new class of stablecoin-native blockchains (Plasma, Arc, 1Money,
Stable, Codex, and Monad) is emerging to capture global payments as
stablecoins head toward a projected $3.7T market cap by 2030. These
chains are built for real-world needs like instant finality, gas-free
or stablecoin-denominated fees, compliant confidential transactions,
and cross-chain interoperability. Rankings from Stablewatch and Castle
Labs place Plasma (USDT-backed Bitcoin bridge) at the top, followed by
Arc (Circle's USDC chain). Monad and Codex target performance and
compliance niches. The race could determine the core infrastructure
for onchain money movement in the digital age. 

 AN EXPLANATION OF IRYS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Irys is a programmable datachain that stores data affordably onchain
while allowing smart contracts to interact directly with that stored
information, differentiating it from traditional blockchains that use
expensive storage or rely on pointers to offchain data. Unlike other
datachains that simply store data permanently, Irys offers both
temporary and permanent storage options with programmable rules
attached directly to the data, enabling use cases like event tickets
with embedded logic for single-use scanning or IP protection. The
platform addresses the high cost of onchain data storage on
general-purpose blockchains while maintaining the verifiability and
permanence that offchain storage solutions cannot guarantee.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ETHEREUM IS THE SPOT FOR RWAS (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum is emerging as the foundation for real-world asset
tokenization, now a $26.5B market, with Ethereum holding 72% of
onchain treasuries. Programmability enables daily dividend payouts and
other investor-friendly features, with institutions like BlackRock,
Apollo, and VanEck already launching products on Ethereum. With $20T+
of assets potentially tokenized and equities as the next frontier,
Ethereum's secure, composable infrastructure positions it as the
backbone for the coming wave of institutional adoption. 

 KINETIQ & PENDLE'S YT/PT: THE OPPORTUNITY ONLY THE WHALES UNDERSTAND
(8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Pendle's yield token mechanism on Kinetiq offers leveraged exposure
to kPoints farming, with YT kHYPE providing 44x multiplier effects
where a $25k position gains points equivalent to holding $1.1M worth
of the underlying token. The strategy involves "sacrificing" HYPE
tokens at maturity in exchange for multiplicative yield and points
during the holding period, with conservative calculations showing
potential 186% ROI based on projected token valuations of $7.81 per
point. Smaller wallets receive significantly better points-to-YT
ratios than large holders, and the average wallet size of $123k on
Kinetiq indicates sophisticated money is already exploiting this
opportunity while retail investors overlook it due to complexity.
