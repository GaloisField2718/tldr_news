ARBITRUM‚ÄôS LONG-AWAITED AIRDROP TO GO LIVE NEXT WEEK, WITH
SELF-EXECUTING DAO (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theblock.co/post/220486/arbitrums-long-awaited-airdrop-to-go-live-next-week-with-self-executing-dao?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Arbitrum announced it will be airdropping 12.75% of its governance
token (ARB) supply to community members on March 23, aiming to
decentralize its network. ARB will govern the Arbitrum One and Nova
networks through a self-executing DAO, which automatically applies
on-chain protocol upgrades. Offchain Labs has also released Arbitrum
Orbit for building Layer 3 networks on top of Arbitrum, providing
higher throughput at low costs. The airdrop will distribute tokens to
users, DAOs, and Protocol Guild, with 42.8% going to the Arbitrum
Foundation. 

FIDELITY INVESTMENTS HAS OPENED BITCOIN TRADING TO THE PUBLIC DURING
ONGOING BANKING CRISIS (2 MINUTE READ)
[/%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/fidelity-has-opened-bitcoin-trading-to-the-public?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Fidelity Investments has expanded its offerings by launching the
Fidelity Crypto platform to the public, enabling customers to buy and
sell bitcoin and ether. While users cannot transfer their coins to
self-custody wallets at this time, the company has hinted at the
possibility of this feature in the future. Forgoing fees directly to
the consumer, the platform will take up to a 1% spread on trades.
Despite facing criticism from some senators, Fidelity remains
undeterred in regard to entering the cryptocurrency market. However,
amid the current banking crisis, concerns about the importance of
self-custody and users controlling their private keys persist.

CRYPTO LONG & SHORT: FINDING ALPHA IN AI-RELATED CRYPTO (5 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/15/crypto-long-short-finding-alpha-in-ai-related-crypto/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


After taking a breather for a bit, the AI theme is heating back in
crypto alongside the buzz about the newly released GPT-4 (even though
they are hardly related). This article discusses the potential of
lesser-known, small-cap AI crypto projects, comparing the process of
researching small and microcap oil and gas companies to digital assets
and AI. It highlights three crypto AI projects and their price action
as of late: SingularityNET (AGIX), Render Token (RNDR), and Fetch.ai
(FET). The author argues that opportunities for alpha are more likely
to be found in lesser-known assets that are waiting to take center
stage, as AI was a few years ago.

KAISEKI - AN ARTHUR HAYES ESSAY (31 MINUTE READ)
[https://cryptohayes.medium.com/kaiseki-b15230bdd09e?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This essay highlights how we got to where we are now starting with
COVID-19 all the way to the recent instability in the banking system
we have been experiencing. The US nationalized corporate credit
markets and flooded the system with liquidity in response to COVID-19.
Stimulus checks boosted the economy, encouraging risk-taking among
asset speculators, leading to a massive bull market and giving rise to
inflation. Banks then took on duration risk as interest rates remained
near 0%. As inflation rose, the Fed increased interest rates, causing
bond prices to fall and banks to face losses. Depositors started
leaving regional banks for higher-yielding alternatives, forcing banks
to sell assets at a loss. This led to the failure of Silvergate and
SVB, highlighting the vulnerability of the US regional banking sector
and a larger crisis the US could be facing. 

U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE‚ÄôS REAL-TIME PAYMENTS SYSTEM COMING IN JULY (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/15/us-federal-reserves-real-time-payments-system-coming-in-july/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


The US Federal Reserve will launch its FedNow Service in July, a
real-time payments system designed to reduce delays in clearing
financial transactions between institutions. The system will operate
24/7, providing immediate access to funds. While many view FedNow as
the logical next step before a CBDC, the service‚Äôs core value
proposition of instant transferability could reduce the need for a
CBDC. Surprisingly, the new system could actually end up benefiting
crypto traders by facilitating quicker funding and withdrawals,
creating more efficient rails.
