MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TOMASZ STANCZAK STEPS DOWN FROM ETHEREUM FOUNDATION (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Tomasz Stanczak is stepping down from his co-Executive Director role
at the Ethereum Foundation after less than a year. Bastian Aue has
been named interim co-ED alongside Hsiao-Wei Wang. Stanczak,
co-founder of Nethermind, had been pushing internal reform but faced
friction over disclosed conflicts of interest with Nethermind,
Flashbots, and VC ties. Industry commentary suggests the departure
reflects power struggles within the foundation. 

 COINBASE Q4 REPORT (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Coinbase has reported record trading volumes alongside 9 consecutive
quarters of native unit growth, all-time high USDC market cap and
on-platform balances, and 4x increase in US derivatives market share
following its 24/7 perps launch and Deribit integration. The exchange
has secured partnerships with five major global banks, including
JPMorgan, Citi, PNC, and Standard Chartered. Six months after
announcing its "Everything Exchange" vision, Coinbase has launched
prediction markets, begun offering 24/5 stock trading, and integrated
millions of Solana assets into its DEX.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 X TO LAUNCH ‘SMART CASHTAGS' FOR REAL-TIME CRYPTO AND STOCK DATA (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 X will roll out “Smart Cashtags” in the coming weeks, letting
users tap tickers in their timeline to view live price charts, related
posts, and direct trading links for stocks and onchain assets,
including smaller-cap tokens. While X will not execute trades itself,
the feature deepens its push into financial services alongside X
Money. It comes with strict API rules aimed at curbing crypto spam and
bot-driven manipulation. 

 PREDICTION MARKETS FOR HEDGING (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Vitalik Buterin argues prediction markets are converging toward
unsustainable "corposlop" (short-term crypto price bets, sports
betting) and should prioritize hedging as the core use case.
Prediction markets on price indices for all major goods and services
could be used as a type of hedged currency, with local LLMs generating
personalized baskets representing each user's expected future
expenses. The system requires interest-bearing denominations like
wrapped stocks or ETH rather than fiat, and could incorporate
autonomous agents for more accurate and full-time information
gathering.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 CRYPTO CAN KILL INTERNET GODS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tech platforms have built "psychological extraction machines" that
monetize user behavior while harvesting data value, creating a digital
caste system where users generate content unpaid. Crypto is "Dharma
through Code" – cryptography as an immutable mathematical truth that
enables decentralization to redistribute power from centralized
platforms back to individuals through private key sovereignty. Rather
than viewing crypto as a speculative casino, treat it as an ark for
building parallel societal infrastructure governed by mathematical
laws instead of corporate algorithms. 

 THEIA - 2025 ANNUAL LETTER (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Theia's 2025 annual letter highlights returns generated purely
through asset selection in a challenging environment where BTC
returned 35%, but median tokens dropped 60-80%. The fund's thesis
centers on crypto evolving from speculative "digital gold" to
functional financial infrastructure, evidenced by stablecoins
facilitating trillions in annual transfers and onchain lending
protocols like Maple and Morpho surpassing $100B. Investment focus
areas include governance innovation through prediction markets and
futarchy (MetaDAO), alongside emerging AI-crypto infrastructure for
agent identity, payments, and coordination.

 PREDICTION MARKETS MUST STOP CATERING TO “DUMB OPINIONS” (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vitalik Buterin warns prediction markets are “over-converging” on
short-term, dopamine-driven bets dominated by uninformed retail
gamblers and risks collapse in bear markets, urging platforms to pivot
away from speculative gambling. He proposes turning markets into
AI-powered hedging tools. These would enable personalized, regionally
indexed baskets that offset real-world costs and could be denominated
in productive assets, potentially replacing fiat-pegged stablecoins. 

 EVERYTHING IS MARKET (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Markets are evolving from outputs into infrastructure, resembling
"markets as APIs" that produce real-time data through adversarial
competition that's costly to fake, unlike conventional APIs returning
stored information. The pattern is already emerging in production:
Coinbase's Borrow/Earn products query Morpho's onchain lending markets
for rates, while Polymarket odds appeared at the Golden Globes and
correctly predicted 26 of 27 winners. There is a "DeFi mullet"
implementation model (fintech front-end, DeFi back-end) using
permissionless markets as regulatory forcing functions, with the
vision extending to one billion traders plus AI agents consuming
markets as programmatic infrastructure.

low of $0.008, marking a sharp divergence between usage and cost.
