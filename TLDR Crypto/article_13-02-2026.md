MARKETS & BUSINESS

 PROPOSED LICENSING RULES FOR STABLECOIN ISSUERS UNDER GENIUS (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The NCUA has released its proposed regulatory framework implementing
the GENIUS Act, requiring stablecoin issuers operating through credit
union subsidiaries to obtain a PPSI (permitted payment stablecoin
issuer) license before launching tokens. The framework includes two
significant provisions favoring crypto adoption: regulators cannot
reject applications solely for using open, public, or decentralized
networks, and applications receive automatic approval if the NCUA
fails to act within 120 days of submission. The rules apply to credit
unions under NCUA jurisdiction, which oversees 4,000+ institutions
managing $2.38 trillion in assets and serving 144 million members. 

 AZTEC NETWORK PROCEEDS WITH TGE DESPITE BEAR MARKET (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Aztec Network is proceeding with its TGE following community
governance approval, despite bearish market conditions, positioning
the move as confidence in their privacy infrastructure built since
2017. The tokenomics structure diverges from typical launch patterns
with no airdrop distribution, 36-month insider lockups with no insider
staking permitted, and over 60% of tokens already staked despite the
absence of liquid staking options. Price discovery occurred through
Uniswap's CCA mechanism that seeded the third-largest Uniswap V4 pool
with 273M AZTEC and 4,234 ETH, with Alpha Network targeting a Q1 2026
launch.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 MIDNIGHT BLOCKCHAIN — CARDANO PARTNER CHAIN (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Midnight, a privacy-focused blockchain that utilizes zero-knowledge
proofs, will launch as a Cardano partner chain in late March, with a
public testing environment going live February 26. The blockchain
differentiates itself through a "rational privacy" model that offers
tiered selective disclosure, allowing users to maintain transaction
privacy by default while sharing specific data with authorized parties
across public, auditor, and god-level access permissions. Google and
Telegram have signed on as network partners. 

 USD.AI LAUNCHES CHIP ICO (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 USD.AI announced that its CHIP token ICO will launch February 22-27
on CoinList at a $300M FDV, featuring a "Level Up" participation
mechanism that uses Pendle's yield token infrastructure to create
differentiated risk/reward profiles for Season 2 participants. The
structure offers two paths: BOOST OWN (4-month lock, $270M FDV
discount at maturity) or MAX OWN (8-month lock, $190M FDV discount),
both with full refund rights for principal protection and access to
6-10% yields via automated YT/PT vault mechanics. The ICO follows
USD.AI's conversion of $100M in GPUs into productive stablecoin yield
and supports its 2026 target of $1.5B in loans.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STABLECOINS BEYOND NARROW BANKING (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Current stablecoins like USDC and USDT operate as narrow banks, fully
backing tokens with reserves but sterilizing capital. Giorgio Giuliani
proposes reconnecting money and credit on-chain to drive economic
activity. This evolution addresses structural constraints in DeFi risk
markets to enable sustainable, scalable financial infrastructure. 

 RWA VAULTS - WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THEY WORK (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 RWA vaults enable users to deposit stablecoins and earn yields from
traditional assets like government bonds, corporate loans, and real
estate debt, with vault managers handling offchain investments through
SPVs and regulated custodians while users receive ERC-4626 tokenized
shares. The model democratizes access to institutional-grade yields by
eliminating geographic restrictions and slashing minimums from $100K+
to as low as $50, while maintaining DeFi composability through vault
tokens usable as collateral. Tokenized US Treasuries have scaled to
over $2.5 billion in TVL as of early 2025 from near-zero two years
prior, with yield profiles ranging from 4-5% for Treasury vaults to
8-15% for higher-risk private credit exposures.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AI AGENTS ARE CRYPTO'S TRUE USERS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Autonomous AI agents need programmable, permissionless money, ways to
receive payment and pay for compute and data, as well as ways to
transact peer-to-peer with instant settlement and no human KYC. Crypto
already provides those rails. In an agentic future, agents start
earning onchain, scale into major economic participants, rapidly pick
the optimal chains by machine testing, and eventually dominate DAO
governance. AI could ultimately account for roughly 30–80% of crypto
activity by 2030. 

 STABLECOINS FOR SKEPTICS (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stablecoins like USDT and USDC bridge crypto programmability with
fiat stability, facilitating efficient global transfers and
conditional payments. Despite skepticism toward human-less finance,
these tools offer decentralized alternatives to traditional banking.
Understanding their mechanics and risks, like the Triffin Dilemma, is
essential for modern payments engineering.
