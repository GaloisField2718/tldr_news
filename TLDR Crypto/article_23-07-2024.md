 THE WORLD INCREASINGLY RUNS ON LITHIUM. THIS COMPANY IS OFFERING
INVESTORS A CHANCE TO OWN A STAKE IN POWERING THE FUTURE (SPONSOR) [4]


 With governments and auto companies racing to switch to renewables,
electric vehicles will soon be the only cars - and almost all of them
run on lithium batteries.

Not since the invention of the steam engine has a fuel technology
promised such a globally transformative impact - and presented such an
investment opportunity [4].

U.S. DoE and General Motors-Backed EnergyX [4] has designed patented
technology [4] that can extract up to 300% more lithium than
traditional methods. Predicted to dominate extraction in the near
future, huge excitement has surrounded the launch of their most recent
open-to-the-public investment round. [4]

This century will be defined by lithium. Don't miss your chance to
invest in the future. [4]

 SEC OFFICIALLY APPROVES SPOT ETHEREUM ETF TRADING (2 MINUTE READ) [5]


 The SEC has approved Spot Ethereum ETFs for trading starting today,
marking the second crypto-based ETF in the U.S. and creating new
investment opportunities for Ethereum. This approval coincides with

 ANY NEAR-TERM REBOUND IN CRYPTO MARKET LIKELY TO BE TEMPORARY:
JPMORGAN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 JPMorgan anticipates that any near-term rebound in the crypto market
will be short-lived, as Bitcoin's current price is deemed too high
relative to its production cost ($43,000) and its volatility-adjusted
comparison to gold ($53,000). Bitcoin and gold may gain from a
potential Trump election win due to perceived crypto-friendly
policies.
