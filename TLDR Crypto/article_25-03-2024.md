 EU COMMITTEES APPROVE BAN ON ANONYMOUS CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS VIA HOSTED
WALLETS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The European Parliament's major committees have approved a ban on
anonymous cryptocurrency transactions through hosted wallets. This
aligns with the new Anti-Money Laundering legislation, which puts
restrictions on cash transactions and anonymous digital payments. The
ban specifically targets custodial crypto wallets offered by
third-party providers. The decision sparked controversy in the space
with some arguing that this is privacy infringement and others arguing
that it isn‚Äôt a big deal. 

 BITCOIN ETFS SEE FULL WEEK OF NET OUTFLOWS, RECORD LOW INFLOWS FOR
BLACKROCK, FIDELITY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A five-day streak of withdrawals from spot Bitcoin ETFs resulted in a
record $888 million outflow last week, causing sentiment to shift in
the space. Notably, Grayscale's GBTC had large outflows that may have
been a result of the liquidation of Genesis. Despite lower inflows
than recent weeks, trading volume for these products remained high,
with volumes increasing around $22 billion to reach $164 billion.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 FRIENDTECH ‚ÄúFUN‚Äù RAISING (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In a clever business maneuver, Friendtech has decided to make its
points system 100% community-driven, going so far as to re-allocate
the VC‚Äôs points (and presumably tokens) to the community. After a
fast start and disappointing follow on as its points campaign dragged
on with no token release, Friendtech has sparked excitement once again
with its most recent decisions about points, with points values rising
on Whales market to over $4/point. 

 PERMISSIONLESS LEVERAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Limitless, a novel protocol, is aiming to replicate Uniswap's impact
on DeFi in the area of leverage trading. Leveraging Uniswap's
Automated Market Maker for asset pricing, Limitless eliminates
reliance on oracles for price feeds and instead provides yield-earning
opportunities for liquidity providers while cutting counterparty risk.
This opens up the possibility of having permissionless, perpetual
market launches for all new tokens, instead of having to wait for them
to be listed on a CEX, and offers liquidation-free leverage trading,
potentially revolutionizing the DeFi derivatives landscape.

 HOW TO FIND MEMECOINS EARLY ON SOLANA (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread provides a step-by-step guide for finding potential
winning memecoins early using Photon on Solana. While this
low-liquidity method may result in losses, it is possible to generate
significant returns with memecoins. Key strategies include screening
for risk profile, ignoring copycats, assessing community activity, and
never fully exiting a successful coin. Success with this method
depends significantly on broader market conditions.

 MEMECOINS AS THE FUTURE OF WORK (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Trading memecoins, digital assets based on internet culture, can be
an empowering activity and serve as a showcase of the future of work.
Memecoins present low barriers to entry, inclusivity, a fair playing
field, and the opportunity to generate significant returns. There is a
sense of community and shared purpose in memecoin communities.
Engaging with memecoins can help developers optimize applications and
boost financial literacy for users and traders. 

 SOCIOECONOMIC NETWORKS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article discusses the potential future of decentralized social
networking through crypto, pointing to the emergence of $DEGEN on
Base. By pairing social data with a single currency across multiple
platforms, $DEGEN may shift the value from platforms to participants
who own, manage, and control the networks it is built upon. These
dynamics could lead to a transformation in how social networking
platforms operate and even the ownership of such platforms.
