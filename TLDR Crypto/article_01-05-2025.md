MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN MINING NEARLY UNPROFITABLE ON AVERAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin mining has become nearly unprofitable, with major public
miners spending over $82,000 per BTC and smaller U.S. operations over
$137,000—well above Bitcoin's current market price. In high-cost
regions like Germany, the cost climbs to nearly $200,000 per coin. To
adapt, large mining farms are deploying energy-efficient rigs and
leasing excess computing capacity for alternative revenue streams. 

 VISA AND BRIDGE PARTNER ON NEW PRODUCT ENABLING STABLECOIN-BACKED
CARDS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Visa and Bridge, a Stripe-acquired startup, have launched a new
product that allows developers to issue Visa cards backed by
stablecoins. Users can spend crypto at any Visa-accepting merchant,
with merchants receiving payments in local currencies. The rollout
will begin in several Latin American countries.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 FULL VERSION OF LLAMAFEED LAUNCHED (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LlamaFeed has launched its Full Version, offering Pro and Llama+
users expanded data, customizable content filters, AI-generated
summaries, and new dashboard sections. The update also includes a
redesigned mobile interface for improved on-the-go usability. 

 INTRODUCING INFINEX CONNECT (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Infinex has unveiled Infinex Connect, a new SDK that transforms its
wallet into a centralized hub for managing dApps across multiple
blockchains. This innovation allows users to interact with various
decentralized applications directly within the Infinex wallet,
eliminating the need to switch between different interfaces and apps.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 TOWARD A UNITED CHAINS OF ETHEREUM (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethereum is currently a fragile alliance of semi-sovereign rollups,
akin to post-Revolution America. To evolve, it must adopt a more
unified, “federal” architecture that makes ETH the indispensable
value anchor. Through L1 scaling and native rollups more tightly
integrated with the base layer, Ethereum could become a cohesive
republic of chains. 

 THE EVOLUTIONARY PATH (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Crypto's increasing dollarization should be viewed as an evolutionary
proving ground rather than a failure. Innovations in DeFi—lending,
AMMs, derivatives, and governance—highlight the potential of
code-based finance. Crypto currently has two unsustainable
relationships with TradFi, one as an R&D lab for incumbents, and
another as a tech layer relying on incumbent infrastructure.
Ultimately, one model will prevail—whether by merging, reverting to
centralization, or advancing fully decentralized protocols. 

 EIP-7938: EXPONENTIAL GAS LIMIT INCREASE VIA DEFAULT CLIENT VOTING
BEHAVIOR (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 EIP-7938 proposes a bold gas limit increase schedule that could scale
Ethereum's L1 execution capacity by 100–1000x in the coming years.
The proposal, supported by advances in ZK proofs, DAS, and evolving
node roles, emphasizes the importance of keeping L1 as Ethereum's
economic hub.

 STABLECOIN B2B PAYMENT IS ALL ABOUT WORKFLOWS, NOT PAYMENT ITSELF (10
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 B2B payments are shaped less by the act of transferring funds and
more by the complex workflows that surround them—such as data
validation, compliance checks, tax reconciliation, and multi-party
approvals. To meet these demands, stablecoins must be embedded within
orchestration layers that manage these processes end-to-end. When
integrated into automated workflows, stablecoin infrastructure can
enable near-instant settlement, onchain compliance triggers,
transparent FX handling, and advanced services like real-time invoice
factoring. 

 INSIDE MOVEMENT'S TOKEN-DUMP SCANDAL: SECRET CONTRACTS, SHADOW
ADVISERS, AND HIDDEN MIDDLEMEN (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Movement Labs is facing backlash after a botched market-making deal
led to a $38M token dump and internal turmoil. Documents show that an
obscure middleman, Rentech, gained control of 66 million MOVE tokens
under questionable terms. The scandal has exposed internal
disagreements, unclear roles between founders, advisers, and legal
teams and raised serious concerns about governance and due diligence
within one of crypto's most high-profile projects.
