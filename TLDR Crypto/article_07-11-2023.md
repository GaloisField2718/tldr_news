 CELSIUS WINNER PROOF GROUP IS IN RUNNING TO RELAUNCH FTX, SOURCES SAY
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Proof Group, a firm that was involved in the successful Celsius bid,
is also bidding to relaunch FTX, which collapsed almost a year ago.
The defunct exchange has received several bids, now down to a
shortlist of three. The final decision is anticipated by mid-December,
with options including selling the entire exchange or partnering with
another exchange to utilize existing user accounts. Restructuring FTX
has been a meticulous process, involving the addressing of issues such
as claims, token lockups, and compliance matters. 

 FCA DISCUSSION PAPER ADVANCES UK STABLECOIN FRAMEWORK (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has continued to work on
regulations for fiat-backed stablecoins, including those issued
outside the UK. In a recent paper, the FCA highlighted the potential
of stablecoins for efficient payments, but also noted previous crypto
custody failures such as Celsius and FTX. The regulator proposed
requirements for issuing fiat-backed stablecoins and custody
activities. The FCA also suggested that issuers should guarantee
specific redemption timeframes for users.

 THE EDGE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article outlines "Edge," a new programming language for the
Ethereum Virtual Machine. The author describes various shortcomings in
the current dominant language, Solidity, and explains how Edge could
offer more developer control, clearer abstractions, and promote
emergent structures over imposed ones. Edge aims to redefine the
abstraction stack by combining the flexibility of low-level languages
like Huff and ETK with high-level type systems, opening up new
possibilities in smart contract development.

 ON PFP NFTS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This thread provides an interesting viewpoint on PFP NFTs and how
they have fared throughout the bear market and this recent uptrend. To
this userâ€™s surprise, PFP NFTs have rebounded more than expected as
the broader crypto market has seen an upturn. He lays out some reasons
why established PFPs seem to be showing strength: no viable
alternatives were launched during the bear market, the liquidity
within existing collections acts as a moat, and collection holders
have built personal brands on top of existing PFP NFTs and are
hesitant to make changes if they have gained traction with that brand.
