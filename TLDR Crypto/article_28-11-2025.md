MARKETS & BUSINESS

 ETHEREUM LIFTS BLOCK GAS LIMIT TO 60M AHEAD OF FUSAKA (4 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Ethereum validators have collectively raised the L1 block gas limit
from 45M to 60M, roughly doubling base-layer transaction capacity
versus a year ago. The change was enabled by protocol safeguards
(EIP-7623), client optimizations, and testnet evidence that the
network can safely handle larger blocks. It lands just days before the
Fusaka hard fork, which introduces PeerDAS and further rollup
throughput gains. 

 UPBIT HIT BY $37M SOLANA HOT-WALLET HACK (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 South Korea's largest exchange, Upbit, detected about 54B KRW (~$37M)
in “abnormal withdrawals” of Solana-ecosystem tokens to an unknown
external wallet and has halted all deposits and withdrawals on Solana.
The exchange says it moved remaining funds to cold storage. It has
already frozen ~$8.2M of LAYER. Upbit will fully compensate affected
users from its own reserves.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 POLYMARKET SECURES CFTC APPROVAL FOR RETURN (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Polymarket has received a CFTC Amended Order of Designation, enabling
US users to trade through futures commission merchants and traditional
brokerages under a full federal regulatory framework. The approval
follows Polymarket's 2022 decision to block US access amid regulatory
pressure. It reflects growing regulatory acceptance of prediction
markets as a mature financial product and positions the platform
alongside other federally supervised exchanges with intermediated
access rather than direct retail participation. The company previously
signaled November relaunch plans. 

 FROM CHAINS TO NETWORK ECONOMIES: ZKSYNC INTEROP & ZK TOKEN UTILITY
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The real crypto opportunity is a shared cryptographic messaging
fabric connecting L2s. Today, global finance runs on siloed messaging
rails that can't verify each other, creating huge coordination costs.
ZKsync Interop + “Prividium” private L2s aim to replace that
fragmentation with verifiable cross-chain messages anchored to
Ethereum, creating a base for ZK token utility via interop fees.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 POST-TGE SCORECARD FOR 2025'S BIG TOKEN LAUNCHES (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Across 2025's major TGEs, only a handful of tokens (AVICI,
YieldBasis, SAHARA, and LMTS) are still within ~20–60% of their ATHs
and count as clear “winners.” Most launches have retraced
70–90%, making them headline flops for anyone who didn't sell early.
This thread ranks projects from S to D tier based on drawdown from
ATH, time since peak, and liquidity. Post-launch PnL has been brutal
for typical buyers. 

 S&P DOWNGRADES TETHER'S USDT STABILITY (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 S&P Global Ratings downgraded Tether's USDT stability assessment to
5, the weakest level, warning that bitcoin's 5.6% share of reserves
exceeds the 3.9% reserve buffer from Q3 attestations, meaning a
material BTC drawdown could leave USDT undercollateralized. Riskier
assets, including bitcoin, gold, secured loans, and corporate bonds,
climbed to 24% of reserves from 17% a year earlier, with S&P flagging
persistent gaps in transparency around custodians, counterparties, and
asset composition despite short-term treasuries comprising the
majority of holdings. CEO Paolo Ardoino rejected the assessment,
claiming Tether is "overcapitalized" and "extremely profitable" while
criticizing legacy rating models, as the agency applies similar
bitcoin-linked liquidity risk concerns. Strategy received a B-minus
speculative-grade rating last month.

 FINALITY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHODLER (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Finality is conditional on beliefs about the future rather than
Bayesian certainty accumulation, with social finality emerging from
community consensus that radical protocol changes or deep reverts will
be rejected. Protocol finality divides into honest threshold finality
relying on Byzantine Agreement safety properties, cryptoeconomic
finality adding slashing accountability where rational coalitions
avoid attacks costing more in stake than rewards, and representative
finality using randomly-sampled committees with stronger assumptions
about honest majorities and adaptive corruption resistance. Finality
strengthens temporally as transactions progress from single-validator
proposals to chain depth to committee endorsement to majority
confirmation and eventually social immutability, with categorical
notions capturing qualitative shifts in protective assumptions despite
feedback loops between confidence and user behavior affecting
reversion risk. 

 THE VOLUME MAP OF PREDICTION MARKETS (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Polymarket and Kalshi captured 88% of prediction markets' $41.8
billion 2025 volume with $18.7 billion and $18.0 billion respectively.
Q3 volumes hit $3 billion, representing 5x growth from 2024, with
October crossing $7.4 billion industry-wide as binary and categorical
outcomes dominate over sports and scalar formats, with Base and
Polygon gaining share for smoother, cheaper trading experiences.
Smaller platforms matter for next-wave innovation, including new
market formats, liquidity mechanisms, and UX models, despite current
volume disparities, comparing the trajectory to early crypto
exchanges. PredictionIndex.xyz launched public dashboards tracking
total volume, 30-day volume, and 24-hour volume for each platform as
the sector accelerates toward potential trillion-dollar annual
industry status before the decade's end.
