 MGX INVESTS $2B IN BINANCE (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based AI and tech investor, has made a landmark $2B

 RUSSIA CENTRAL BANK PROPOSES ALLOWING RICH INVESTORS TO BUY AND SELL
CRYPTO (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Russia's central bank has proposed new regulations allowing high
net-worth individuals (>$11.5M assets) and qualified institutions to
trade crypto during a three-year testing period. Aiming to increase
market transparency while maintaining a ban on crypto as a general
payment method, this marks another step in Russia's evolving stance on
digital assets following its legalization of crypto for international
payments and mining amid ongoing sanctions.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING GIZA PROTOCOL (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Giza Protocol is building infrastructure to enable trustless,
context-aware, and permissionless agents in Web3 powered by a
three-layer infrastructure‚ÄîSemantic Abstraction for AI-blockchain
interaction, Decentralized Execution with EigenLayer's cryptoeconomic
security, and Agent Authorization for non-custodial control. Giza aims
to democratize algorithmic finance and enhance capital efficiency
across protocols.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO GET NEW USERS IN CRYPTO (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Acquiring new users in crypto is increasingly challenging due to
market saturation with over 8,700 L1s and 5,200 L2s, fragmented global
audiences, trust issues stemming from premature technology, and 415
Bitcoin ‚Äúdeath‚Äù headlines, as evidenced by declining Google search
trends for ‚Äúcrypto.‚Äù Developers are overcoming these barriers
through personalized onboarding, coordinated marketing across
stakeholders, consistent messaging, and storytelling to engage users,
helping founders cut through attention fragmentation. 

 WHAT WILDCATFI COULD LEAD TO (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 WildcatFi addresses undercollateralized lending risks in DeFi by
emphasizing transparency, requiring borrower financial disclosures,
and implementing safeguards against manipulation while exploring
collateral options to mitigate defaults. The protocol aims to enable
on-chain debt financing for crypto businesses, arguing that improved
data visibility and tailored terms can align risk-reward dynamics
despite inherent credit challenges. 

 ONE TRADER VS. HYPERLIQUID'S HLP VAULT (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A trader used high leverage to build a massive ETH long position on
Hyperliquid, then strategically withdrew collateral to trigger
liquidation, offloading risk onto the HLP vault while hedging
elsewhere for profit. The result: a $1.8M gain for the trader and a
$4M loss for HLP, exposing vulnerabilities in liquidity mechanics
rather than an outright exploit.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MAKE REVENUE GREAT AGAIN (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Amid declining liquidity and valuation pressures in Web3, revenue is
re-emerging as a critical focus, pushing projects to adopt
transactional fee models over speculative token launches. Industry
leaders like Uniswap sustain consistent fees, while infrastructure
providers like Polymarket and MetaMask generate significant revenue
from transaction volumes, with some, like Ronin and Kaito,
experimenting with token buybacks to tie value to cash flow. 

 TREZOR SAFE 3 SUSCEPTIBLE TO PHYSICAL SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Ledger Donjon's security research revealed a potential supply chain
attack on Trezor Safe 3 where an attacker could tamper with its
microcontroller to compromise user funds, despite the device using a
Secure Element. Trezor responded by addressing the vulnerabilities,
highlighting the importance of cross-industry cooperation and
continuous security improvements in the crypto space.

 INTERNET FINANCE BEGINS WITH UNDERSERVED MARKETS (6 MINUTE READ) [16]

global assets.
