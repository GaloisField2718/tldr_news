 THE WORLD INCREASINGLY RUNS ON LITHIUM. THIS COMPANY IS OFFERING
INVESTORS A CHANCE TO OWN A STAKE IN POWERING THE FUTURE (SPONSOR) [4]


 With governments and auto companies racing to switch to renewables,
electric vehicles will soon be the only cars - and almost all of them
run on lithium batteries.

Not since the invention of the steam engine has a fuel technology
promised such a globally transformative impact - and presented such an
investment opportunity [4].

U.S. DoE and General Motors-Backed EnergyX [4] has designed patented
technology [4] that can extract up to 300% more lithium than
traditional methods. Predicted to dominate extraction in the near
future, huge excitement has surrounded the launch of their most recent
open-to-the-public investment round. [4]

This century will be defined by lithium. Don't miss your chance to
invest in the future. [4]

 OVER $740 MILLION WORTH OF TOKENS TO UNLOCK IN NEXT 30 DAYS (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Over 40 protocols, including StarkNet, ImmutableX, and Aptos, are
unlocking a combined $740 of frozen tokens over the next month. The
highest unlock is the Gaming L3 XAI, which will unlock $109 million in
tokens, followed by Aptos and Arbitrum, which will unlock around $80
million each. Token prices have already begun sliding as investors are
concerned about the negative impact of more supply without demand. 

 US SEC CLOSES INVESTIGATION IN ETHEREUM 2.0, ‚ÄòMAJOR WIN' FOR
INDUSTRY: CONSENSYS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The SEC has ended its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, which
Consensys believes confirms that ETH sales are not considered
securities transactions. This decision comes after a request from
Consensys to clarify whether ETH is considered a commodity.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHENA TOKENOMICS UPDATE AND RESTAKING FEATURES (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ENA and sUSDe will be available to deposit in the Symbiotic restaking
protocol. ENA will eventually provide security for the Ethena Chain.
The chain will host apps built with USDe as the primary asset and gas
token. Going forward, any user receiving an ENA airdrop must lock at
least 50% in a restaking module, as PT-ENA on Pendle, or basic
staking. 

 INTRODUCING ZKVM 1.0: THE FUTURE OF VERIFIABLE COMPUTATION (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 RiscZero's zkVM is the first production-ready zkVM. It makes
zero-knowledge proofs available and cost-effective for any chain. Any
Rust program can be proven and verified across chains, allowing for
greater cross-chain compatibility. It claims to beat Succinct's SP1
zkVM in both cost and speed on various hardware setups.

 CELEBRITY CRYPTO PUMP-AND-DUMPS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread highlights the numerous celebrity NFT collections and
tokens that ended up dead, rugged, or abandoned. Highlights from the
last cycle include Ethereum Max, which was promoted by Kim Kardashian
and Floyd Mayweather and is down 99.96% and Mila Kunis' Stoner Cats
NFT project, which the SEC charged with being an unregistered
securities offering. This cycle has been memecoin-dominated, with
tokens from Caitlyn Jenner and Davido down over 90% from their peak. 

 POST-ZK AIRDROP PLAYBOOK (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 With 49.2% of the ZK supply remaining for community allocation and
19.9% going to ecosystem incentives, there will likely be high rewards
on ZKsync yield farms and LP positions. Other ZK rollups without a
token, including Scroll and Linea, are doing relatively linear
airdrops that reward users for holding assets on their chains.
EigenLayer-adjacent projects like Symbiotic, Karak, and Swell offer
exposure to the popular restaking narrative.

 NOTCOIN FOUNDER SETS OUT HOW TELEGRAM GAMES, INCLUDING HIS OWN, WILL
EVOLVE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Notcoin's founder believes the future of Telegram-based games like
Notcoin are sustainable models rather than fleeting successes like
clicker games. Notcoin is moving away from its initial airdrop-driven
model to more robust systems that facilitate interaction with newer
games. 

 L2 BLOB FEES SKYROCKETED ON MONDAY (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 L2 blob fees increased dramatically on Monday, accounting for 21% of
batch posting costs to Ethereum (blobs submitted per block exceeded
the target). This spike, likely caused by the zkSync airdrop,
indicates that blob fee dynamics are important for L2 operators to
monitor because they can impact cost and revenue projections.
