 THE MEMECOIN CULT PSYCHOLOGY (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The formation of a “memecoin cult” involves individuals
disillusioned by losses in utility coins who then find success and
validation in memecoins. They then begin a journey going through
stages of reinforced belief, social frustration, and eventual full
commitment to a shared belief system centered around a charismatic
leader. This process is driven by financial loss, emotional
attachment, and social validation in cryptocurrency markets and online
communities, resulting in a powerful feedback loop that is difficult
to break. 

 CRYPTO X AI (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 While AI memecoins currently attract attention due to the ease of
fine-tuning open-source models like Llama and adding tokens, the real
future lies in decentralized AI models trained with token incentives.
These decentralized models will become powerful engines for apps in
crypto and DeFi, surpassing centralized models by enabling AI to build
and operate protocols, manage decentralized economies, and create
unbiased ecosystems without centralized control.

 APECHAIN TO BE BAYC'S LAST HURRAH (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apechain may be a last effort for the BAYC brand because of its
ineffective use of APE (the token) as a gas token, low native yield,
and disconnected branding that complicates outsiders from
participating in the larger BAYC ecosystem. It would be better to
rebrand to be less BAYC-centric, redirect ecosystem revenue back to
APE through incentives like sequencer fees and governance, and
integrate Yuga assets into validators to better incentivize economic
activity and attract new builders.
