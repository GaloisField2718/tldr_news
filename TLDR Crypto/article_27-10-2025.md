MARKETS & BUSINESS

 JPMORGAN TO LET CLIENTS USE CRYPTO AS COLLATERAL FOR LOANS (7 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 JPMorgan is developing a framework that will allow institutional
clients to use Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral for loans. The
program is expected to launch by the end of 2025 under a third-party
custody model where approved custodians hold the pledged tokens. This
marks one of the most direct integrations of crypto assets into Wall
Street's credit systems to date. It positions BTC and ETH within the
same collateral ecosystem as traditional instruments like Treasuries
and equities. The move introduces significant operational challenges,
as banks must now manage 24/7 mark-to-market assets with real-time
volatility modeling, dynamic margin requirements, and custodial risk
insurance within legacy settlement infrastructure. 

 BASE TOKEN COULD BE WORTH AS MUCH AS $34 BILLION (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 JPMorgan analysts projected that a Base network token could achieve a
market cap of $12 billion to $34 billion based on current network
activity and "lofty token economics," with Coinbase likely retaining
40% of the supply. The bank raised its Coinbase rating and lifted its
December 2026 price target to $404, citing the Base token exploration
as part of a broader shift toward "deeper onchain monetization"
alongside changes to USDC rewards and new DEX integration features.
JPMorgan's analysis also highlighted that Coinbase could retain
approximately $374 million annually by limiting USDC yield payouts to
Coinbase One subscribers rather than all users, and noted the
Base-integrated DEX aggregator as a strategic hedge against
decentralized exchanges now capturing roughly 25% of spot trading
volume.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 FROM UPLOAD TO ACCESS: HOW X402 EXPANDS CLOUD (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AR.IO is integrating x402, an open protocol for internet-native
payments that uses HTTP status code 402 to enable pay-per-request
transactions with zero built-in fees, instant settlement, and
blockchain-agnostic compatibility. The protocol will allow AR.IO's
650+ gateways serving the Permanent Cloud to monetize traffic directly
at the request level, creating a two-sided economic model where users
pay for uploads via Turbo and for data access via x402. Gateway
operators gain direct monetization beyond staking rewards while
maintaining control over pricing and access, with the ability to
whitelist specific ArNS names to serve for free and protect against
abuse from bad actors attaching names to massive files. 

 DECENTRALIZING X402 PAYMENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A developer released an open-source library that lets anyone run
their own x402 payment facilitator, removing the need to register or
depend on Coinbase's platform for mainnet integration. The tool
enables developers to self-host payment rails directly within their
apps using just a few lines of code, avoiding centralization risks or
censorship.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 X402 TRANSACTIONS EXPLODE OVER 10,000% IN A MONTH (5 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Coinbase's x402 protocol, which enables AI agents to transact
autonomously in stablecoins over the internet, experienced a 10,780%
surge in transaction activity over the past month. The protocol,
introduced in May, resurrects the Internet Communication Protocol's
HTTP 402 "Payment Required" standard to create a seamless,
credit-card-free payment system where AI agents and humans can pay
directly while using websites or apps through signed stablecoin
payments that x402 verifies automatically. The explosive growth has
spawned a new x402 token ecosystem now tracked by CoinGecko with a
market capitalization approaching $180 million. The surge aligns with
a16z's prediction in its 2025 State of Crypto report that autonomous
AI transactions could reach $30 trillion by 2030. 

 SIX YEARS OF CRYPTO LESSONS, CONDENSED (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The six-year crypto playbook emphasizes focus, discipline, and
adaptability. One must figure out their niche, define their edge, and
understand narratives to navigate the attention-driven market. Trade
with clear plans and smart sizing, ride winners, and keep a
concentrated portfolio that prioritizes conviction over
diversification. Finally, track performance and use AI-driven
journaling to refine your strategy and continuously improve.

 DEFI FOR AI AGENTS IS THE NEXT BIG THING (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI agents are automating DeFi strategies across stablecoin yields,
Bitcoin yields, Pendle PT token management, and trading execution,
offering advantages like 24/7 operation, direct smart contract
interaction, and emotion-free decision-making. Projects like Almanak
manage over $164M in stablecoins offering 15% APY, while Gizatech's
Pulse Agents manage 1,250+ ETH on Pendle with fixed 12% returns, and
Mode Network has deployed fully autonomous breakout and trend trading
agents. The automation extends beyond yield farming to trading
overlays like HeyAnonai's HUD and copy-trading platforms like Loomlay.
Future use cases are expected in airdrop farming, funding rate
arbitrage, smart contract audits, and prediction market betting. 

 PREDICTION MARKETS ARE MISUNDERSTOOD BY EVERYONE (9 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Prediction markets force participants to commit capital behind
beliefs, creating Darwinian selection for truth-telling that matters
beyond dollar volumes in a post-truth AI-generated slop era where
social media claims cost nothing and TV pundits face no consequences
for being wrong. The structural difference from sportsbooks is
critical as prediction platforms win from increased activity rather
than customer losses, making incentives more aligned despite real
consumer protection concerns, including a 61% increase in gambling
addiction help-seeking after legalization and sports betting becoming
neobanks' number one non-discretionary spend category. The
infrastructure must embed protections rather than bolting them on
after harm occurs.

 L2 “STAGE 2” STILL A MIRAGE (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 No major Layer 2 on L2Beat has yet achieved Stage 2 decentralization,
despite massive funding and engineering talent, perhaps proving that
full trustlessness remains impractical under current designs. 

 ETH DATS AND AAVE ARE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 ETH DATs now hold ~3.6% of all ETH and can use Aave to collateralize,
borrow, and reinvest, boosting ETH-per-share without dilution. 

 AUTONOMOUS AGENTS ARE NOW RUNNING BUSINESSES WITH X402 (2 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Using Coinbase's x402 protocol and Google's A2A (Agent-to-Agent)
framework, agents can now autonomously hire, pay, and verify each
other, no humans required. 

 ELIZAOS X402 GATEWAY POWERS AGENTIC PAYMENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The new ElizaOS x402 MCP Gateway integrates multiple MCP servers to
enable autonomous onchain payments for AI agents.
