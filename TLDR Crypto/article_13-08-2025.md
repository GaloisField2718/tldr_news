MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SPOT ETH ETFS TOP $1B IN DAILY NET INFLOWS FOR FIRST TIME (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded over $1.02 billion in daily net
inflows on Monday, their highest single-day total to date, led by
BlackRock's ETHA and Fidelity's FETH. The milestone pushes total
inflows since May to $10.83 billion, signaling rising institutional
conviction in Ethereum's role as a foundational asset for DeFi and
Web3. Ethereum's price has increased 45% over the past month, further
fueled by growing TradFi treasury allocations and favorable regulatory
momentum. 

 QUBIC CLAIMS MAJORITY CONTROL OF MONERO HASHRATE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Qubic mining pool, led by former IOTA co-founder Sergey
Ivancheglo, claims to control over 51% of Monero's hashrate,
potentially enabling it to reorganize blocks, censor transactions, and
execute double-spend attacks on the privacy-focused blockchain. The
project's hashrate share surged from under 2% in May to over 25% by
late July through a "useful proof-of-work" model that converts Monero
mining rewards into USDT to buy and burn QUBIC tokens. While
Ivancheglo frames this as a stress test to help Monero prepare for
future threats, industry experts, including Ledger's CTO, have warned
of a live 51% attack in progress, with some questioning Qubic's
economic model and claims. Monero's price has declined 6.65% in 24
hours and 16% over the past week amid the controversy and security
concerns.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 CIRCLE TO LAUNCH LAYER 1 BLOCKCHAIN ARC (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Circle has announced plans to launch Arc, an EVM-compatible Layer 1
blockchain that will use its USDC stablecoin as the native gas token,
with a public testnet expected this fall. The enterprise-focused chain
is designed for stablecoin payments, foreign exchange, and capital
markets applications. It features sub-second settlement, optional
privacy, and interoperability with other blockchains. Circle, the
second-largest stablecoin issuer with $65 billion in USDC supply,
joins competitor Tether in developing stablecoin-focused blockchain
infrastructure. The announcement coincided with Circle's Q2 earnings
report, which showed 53% revenue growth to $658 million. The company's
stock grew 6.2% in pre-market trading following the news. 

 HERITAGE DISTILLING AND STORY LAUNCH $360M $IP TOKEN RESERVE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Heritage Distilling (Nasdaq: CASK) is allocating $82M from a $220M
PIPE raise to buy $IP tokens from Story Foundation, marking a16z's
first Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) deal and Cantor's first
underwriting of a non-BTC/ETH/SOL treasury firm. Framed as a public AI
infrastructure play, Story will use proceeds to repurchase $IP on the
open market within 90 days. The move signals Stage 3 of DATs, onchain
treasuries merging with public equity and AI narratives.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STRIPE'S BLOCKCHAIN VISION: REPLACING THE CARD NETWORK ENTIRELY (1
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 With its acquisition of Bridge and Privy, Stripe is building out a
full-stack crypto payments stack, topped off by its own L1 blockchain.
Stripe's wallet (via Privy), stablecoin infra (via Bridge), and L1
could bypass traditional card networks entirely, unlocking direct
stablecoin payments, programmable subscriptions, and DeFi yield on
merchant float. If successful, Stripe will shift from a payment
processor to an on-chain payment network. 

 COINBASE REVIVES STABLECOIN FUNDING PROGRAM FOR DEFI (6 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Coinbase is reviving its Stablecoin Bootstrap Fund, originally
launched in 2019, to boost stablecoin liquidity across decentralized
finance protocols through its asset management arm. The program begins
with capital deployments in USDC and EURC stablecoins on platforms
including Aave, Morpho, Kamino, and Jupiter, with broader rollouts
planned after initial testing. The original fund successfully
supported early DeFi platforms like Uniswap, Compound, and dYdX in
establishing USDC as the dominant stablecoin in the sector. This
revival comes as DeFi assets have nearly doubled to $200 billion since
April, though the sector remains below its 2021 peak despite
accelerating growth amid favorable crypto market conditions.

 HYPERLIQUID EYES PREDICTION PERP MARKETS WITH HIP-3 (2 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Hyperliquid's proposed HIP-3 design would turn static prediction
markets into high-leverage perpetuals with shared liquidity and
permissionless market creation. Binary markets like TRUMPWIN (shown in
the chart spiking to $1.00) come with severe jump risks at expiry,
requiring safeguards like liquidation bands and leverage decay. Scalar
markets are safer near-term targets, offering smoother pricing and
proportional losses and paving the way for a new class of
high-frequency event-based trading. 

 EXTENDED DEX LAUNCHES ON STARKNET WITH 100X LEVERAGE (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Perpetuals DEX Extended, led by former Revolut execs, has launched on
Starknet with over 50 pairs and up to 100x leverage. The move from
StarkEx to Starknet aims to boost user experience for EVM-compatible
wallets while maintaining high throughput. With $319M in daily volumes
and 70% recent APR, the launch showcases how fintech-grade DeFi is
scaling through zk-rollups.
