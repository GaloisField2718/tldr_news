MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BLACKROCK PLANS TO LAUNCH A BITCOIN ETP IN EUROPE (2 MINUTE READ) [4]


 BlackRock is expanding its crypto offerings with its first non-US
Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Switzerland. Its US-based
iShares Bitcoin ETF has accumulated nearly $60 billion AUM within its
first year. As the world's largest asset manager with more than $10
trillion in AUM, BlackRock is well positioned to enter the European
market even though firms like Kraken and Bitstamp have recently
secured licenses for crypto derivatives. More competition could reduce
the ETP fees, which have reached as high as 2.5% in Europe. 

 MICROSTRATEGY IS NOW STRATEGY (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 MicroStrategy has rebranded to Strategy, adopting a new
Bitcoin-inspired corporate identity with an orange color scheme and
stylized “B” logo. The company has positioned itself as the
world's largest Bitcoin Treasury Company through billions of dollars
in treasury purchases of BTC. It plans to continue to focus on
business intelligence while accumulating Bitcoin as its primary
treasury reserve asset.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BRINGING INTEROPERABILITY TO ARBITRUM AND ETHEREUM (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Offchain Labs is improving interoperability between Arbitrum (L2) and
Ethereum (L1) by introducing a Universal Intent Engine. This will
enable crosschain swaps and transfers in less than three seconds. The
Arbitrum team hopes to facilitate trustless, cost-efficient
interactions across EVM-compatible chains by bringing interoperability
to Arbitrum and Ethereum. 

 TRACK UNISWAP V4 GROWTH WITH ALLIUM'S NEW ANALYTICS DASHBOARD (1
MINUTE READ) [7]

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AGENTIC DAOS AND AUTONOMOUS CORPORATIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Agentic DAOs is a new organization concept that prioritizes
programmatic alignment of incentives and AI-driven automation over
decentralization. This author envisions Autonomous Corporations
(AutoCorps) that drive shareholder value through autonomous
decision-making via proprietary models. For these agents to drive
value, there must be “intelligence mining” where they extract
value from real-time latent space and create “cognitive
arbitrage.” 

 GEMINI 2025 TREND REPORT (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The crypto market completely transformed in 2024, largely driven by
BTC and ETH ETFs and institutional interest. Solana captured record
levels of interest and adoption, primarily driven by retail
speculation and the success of Pump.fun. The APAC region saw strong
retail growth of 6.4%.

 BERACHAIN: A DAVID TO RIVAL SOLANA AND ETHEREUM OR ANOTHER
FARM-AND-FORGET CHAIN? (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Berachain is set to launch its mainnet on February 6 and introduce a
unique Proof of Liquidity (PoL) consensus model that integrates
liquidity provision with network security. With $3.3B in pre-launch
liquidity and a novel tokenomics system, Berachain could disrupt
traditional blockchain models, though challenges like governance
centralization and long-term sustainability remain key considerations.


 BEAR CASE ON ETH (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post challenges Ethereum's previous dominance in alt seasons
because of its alleged stagnant innovation, leadership issues, and
reliance on L2s, all of which have led to an overvalued market cap
without clear new use cases to drive demand. Although traders may hope
for an ETH pump to trigger an alt season, the reality is that market
cycles evolve, and successful projects like Solana and tokens with
strong fundamentals (e.g., AAVE) are already outperforming the general
market by catering to real user demand. 

 KEY TRENDS FROM JPM'S REMITTANCE REPORT (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Crypto is revolutionizing digital money by turning mobile phones into
banks. It has the potential to disrupt remittances, telcos, and
fintechs due to its alleged lower fees and faster transactions. There
are now ~36M crypto mobile wallet users, remittance costs have dropped
to 3.25% on average, and fintech players like PayPal have enabled
stablecoin transfers via African crypto exchanges like Yellowcard.
