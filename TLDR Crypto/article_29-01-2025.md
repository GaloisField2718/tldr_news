 'CRYPTO IS BACK': VARIOUS INVESTOR GROUPS SEE A NEED TO RAMP UP AMID
US POLITICAL SHIFT (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Analysts report growing institutional interest in crypto markets amid
the Trump administration's policy shift, with diverse investor groups
across finance, tech, and energy looking to increase their crypto
exposure. Bernstein maintains a $200,000 Bitcoin price target for
end-2025, citing catalysts like Trump's executive order, potential
strategic digital asset reserves, and a projected $120 billion in
Bitcoin ETF and corporate purchases in 2025. While institutional
investors remain neutral on direct Bitcoin exposure, they show
particular interest in crypto-related equities, with Robinhood seeing
a 370% rise over 12 months and mining companies pivoting toward AI
capabilities, leading Bernstein to maintain outperform ratings on
several sector stocks including MicroStrategy, Robinhood, and Core
Scientific. 

 ETHEREUM'S ACTIVE ADDRESSES SURGE 37% AS INSTITUTIONAL AND DEFI
INTEREST GROWS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ethereum's active addresses have increased 37% to 575K driven by
growing institutional interest and sustained DeFi activity, with
Uniswap maintaining a 22% DEX market share and processing nearly $1
billion in daily volume. Despite Solana dominating memecoin trading,
Ethereum's network fundamentals remain strong, with increasing
transactions and institutional investments, though fees have declined
from December 2024 levels.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ANNOUNCING NOUS PSYCHE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nouse Research has launched Psyche, a decentralized AI training
infrastructure built on Solana designed to democratize
superintelligence development through distributed compute resources.
The platform uses Nous DisTrO tech, which achieved 1,000-10,000x
bandwidth compression in training runs and successfully tested a 15B
language model using compute from multiple providers including Oracle
and Lambda Labs. The initial testnet phase will coordinate whitelisted
GPU owners for cooperative model training, with plans to expand into a
permissionless network. Nous plans to develop its next-generation LLMs
on the platform. 

 SYMBIOTIC LAUNCHES ON ETH MAINNET (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Symbiotic has launched on the Ethereum mainnet, introducing a fully
modular shared security protocol with customizable slashing and
operator selection. With 13 networks already live and nearly 50 more
integrating, Symbiotic aims to make decentralized security seamless
and accessible.

 HOW TO FARM THE ABSTRACT AIRDROP (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Abstract's reward system features XP and badges targeting three
distinct user groups: general users, developers, and content creators.
The platform's ecosystem includes over 30 active or upcoming
applications and numerous gaming partnerships. XP is earned through
platform interaction, app development, and content creation. Special
considerations have been made for Pudgy Penguins ecosystem
participants, who might receive an allocation of the drop or a boost
on XP. 

 MARKET RHYMES: TIME TO TAKE PROFITS? (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The crypto market faces mounting pressure from both external and
internal factors, with macroeconomic challenges including a
strengthening US dollar, global bond market selloffs, and reduced
expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. Within the crypto
world, an oversupply of new tokens (70,000 daily launches on Pump.fun)
and changing investor behavior favoring Bitcoin, memecoins, and AI
over traditional altcoins have created challenging market conditions.
Bitcoin metrics show declining profit-taking volumes (down 93% from
December 2024), reduced exchange inflows, and increasing long-term
holder accumulation, while the historically narrow 60-day price range
suggests impending volatility.

 DEEPSEEK R1: THE OPEN-SOURCE BREAKTHROUGH IGNITING DEFAI 'S NEXT ERA
(6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The DeepSeek model, which caused the market to tumble due to concerns
that it's easier than we thought to train AI, has promising
implications for the democratization of AI development. As an
open-source model that offers near state-of-the-art reasoning
capabilities with reduced hardware requirements, the model's
efficiency could trigger broader AI adoption across industries
including DeFAI, where it enables continuous operation of autonomous
trading agents. The Jevons paradox suggests that improved efficiency
might lead to increased overall resource consumption due to wider
adoption. 

 FILLING UP FROM THE BOTTOM: A NEW MECHANISM FOR ALLOCATING TOKENS (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The “Filling Up From the Bottom” token allocation method ensures
a fair distribution by prioritizing the maximum number of participants
while still allowing larger buyers to express demand. Instead of
favoring pro-rata allocations based on capital, the mechanism evenly
distributes available tokens up to a certain threshold, ensuring all
users receive at least a minimum allocation, optimizing inclusivity in
fixed-price sales.
