 SAM BANKMAN-FRIED SENTENCED TO 25 YEARS IN PRISON FOR ORCHESTRATING
FTX FRAUD (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been sentenced to 25 years in
prison on seven fraud and conspiracy charges related to the collapse
of the FTX exchange. He was also fined $11 billion, around the same
amount that was lost by the exchange and the Alameda trading firm. The
judge recommended he serve his sentence in a medium or low-security
federal prison near the Bay Area to facilitate family visitation. 

 >$1B IN US TREASURY NOTES TOKENIZED ON PUBLIC BLOCKCHAINS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The market for tokenized U.S. government securities has surged since
January 2023, surpassing $1 billion. The data reflects a significant
uptick in demand and adoption of blockchain technology for traditional
financial assets, with tokenized Treasuries offering a modern,
blockchain-based approach to trading government bonds.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BLOBSTREAM LIVE ON BASE MAINNET (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Blobstream is now live on the Base Mainnet, marking an evolution in
onchain development. Developers can now create high-throughput
blockspaces, comparable to smart contracts, using Celestia's modular
data availability (DA) layer. This innovation removes the need for
alternative Layer 1s or centralized DA solutions, allowing for
seamless deployment within the same ecosystem. Developed by Succinct
Labs, Blobstream acts as a data attestation bridge, ensuring rollup
data integrity on Celestia through DA attestations and Merkle proofs
and facilitating the scaling of Ethereum's rollup frameworks. 

 DEGEN LAUNCHING L3 ON BASE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Degen Chain is a pioneering Layer 3 (L3) platform designed for the
/degen community. It is built upon Arbitrum Orbit with Base for
settlement and AnyTrust for data availability. Degen Chain uses $DEGEN
as its native gas token, making it one of the first community tokens
to operate with its own L3 infrastructure. This innovation, offering
ultra-low-cost transactions and new scalable solutions for the EVM
ecosystem, represents a significant step in onchain internet
evolution.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ETHEREUM HAS BLOBS. WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In this post, Vitalik Buterin discusses the success of blobs in
bringing Ethereum from a zero-to-one problem to a one-to-N problem.
Scaling Ethereum will have incremental progress and will see blobs get
bigger and rollups more efficient at using them. Security standards
for rollups need to become stricter as only Arbitrum has reached stage
1 of decentralization. While protocol development is decelerating, it
is accelerating on the application layer. Buterin concludes by urging
developers to build for the Ethereum of the 2020s. 

 ON WHAT IS DECENTRALIZED (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread explores the current state of decentralization,
emphasizing the contrast between permissionless blockchains like
Ethereum and websites like OpenSea. Any website can choose whether or
not to display an NFT, but they cannot modify the NFT itself. Most
Layer 2s are still fairly centralized and controlled by a few parties.
Decentralization will likely improve in the coming years.

 ETHEREUM ‚ÄòBLOBSCRIPTIONS‚Äô LIFT OFF AND IT‚ÄôS TAKING BLOB FEES
WITH IT (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Blobs, the new storage type for Ethereum L2s introduced in the March
13 Dencun upgrade, have been overrun by the inscriptions mania that
previously congested several other chains earlier this year.
BlobScriptions caused blob gas fees to spike to around $18, though it
has since fallen to around $1.20. The fees should return to normal
levels as the true value of blobs becomes evident after this price
discovery phase. 

 A BRIEF HISTORY OF MEMECOINS (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Memecoins blend internet culture with digital currency. Tracing back
to the early days of cryptocurrency, with each cycle introducing new
iterations, they gained momentum through early Bitcoin alternatives,
ICO crazes, DeFi summer, and meme stocks, evolving to include NFTs
which brought visual representation to these tokens. Memecoins, such
as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, have often been regarded as cultural
tokens, gaining value from their associated memes and community
engagement. Despite their potential for high returns, they carry risks
of volatility and regulatory uncertainty.
