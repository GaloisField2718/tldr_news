MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN AND THE FED RATE CUT (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Federal Reserve cut rates 25 basis points to 3.50-3.75% as
expected, despite unusually large public dissension, with Kansas City
Fed's Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago Fed's Austan Goolsbee voting to hold
steady, while Trump appointee Stephen Miran dissented for a 50 basis
point cut. Updated projections lowered core inflation to 3% for 2025
and raised GDP growth to 2.3% for 2026, though the dot plot maintained
one 2026 rate cut versus markets pricing two as policymakers operate
without key economic data delayed by the government shutdown. Bitcoin
remained around $92,400 following the announcement as US stocks moved
modestly higher and the 10-year Treasury yield dipped 2 basis points
to 4.15%, with CME FedWatch pricing 24% odds of a January cut ahead of
Powell's press conference. 

 GEMINI WINS CFTC APPROVAL FOR PREDICTION MARKETS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Gemini just got CFTC approval to run a Designated Contract Market,
clearing it to launch a fully regulated prediction market called
Gemini Titan in the US. It will start with simple binary “yes/no”
event contracts and could later expand into crypto futures, options,
and perpetuals under the same regulatory umbrella. Gemini actually
filed for this DCM license back in 2020, but only now is positioning
it directly for the booming prediction-market vertical that Kalshi and
Polymarket helped prove out.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 CIRCLE LAUNCHING PRIVACY-CENTRIC VERSION OF USDC ON ALEO (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Circle launched USDCx on Aleo's testnet via its xReserve platform,
enabling privacy-preserving stablecoin transactions using
zero-knowledge proofs for use cases spanning payroll, remittances,
foreign aid, and national security. Aleo is building blockchain
privacy infrastructure, with mainnet launch expected by the end of
January, allowing users to protect transaction histories while
maintaining regulatory compliance. Circle's xReserve enables
blockchains to launch USDC-backed stablecoins that interoperate with
native USDC, unifying liquidity. 

 GONDOR: BORROW AGAINST YOUR POLYMARKET POSITIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Gondor launched a DeFi protocol, allowing traders to borrow USDC at
up to 50% loan-to-value against Polymarket ERC-1155 position tokens
with dynamic interest capped at 10-30% based on market risk,
liquidating at a 77% threshold by buying opposite outcomes and merging
pairs for $1 redemption. The platform offers automated 2x leverage
through recursive borrowing loops and applies early closure mechanisms
for time-sensitive markets that linearly reduce liquidation thresholds
to zero starting seven days before resolution. Three actively-managed
funds – Conservative, Moderate, and Growth – currently supply
lending liquidity during beta with team-selected market support based
on liquidity, spreads, and slippage. V1 launching in 2026 will
introduce cross-margining, enabling multiple positions as collateral
bundles with diversified pricing, addressing remaining prediction
market borrowing risks.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE ANATOMY OF A CRYPTO NEOBANK/“DEFIBANK” (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A “crypto neobank” effectively rebuilds four functions (Saving,
Spending, Earning, and Borrowing) onchain. Today, CEXes act like
quasi-neobanks but are still tied to legacy rails and custodial risk,
while most DeFi products are siloed. A true DefiBank would be fully
onchain, self-custodial, and composable with stablecoin “savings”
backed 1:1, payments that bypass card networks, trading/earn built on
DEX routing, and borrowing that mixes onchain collateral with offchain
credit data. 

 THE ETHEREUM MOAT (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethereum's unopinionated, general-purpose strategy that enabled its
WWIII-resistant global settlement system is now impossible to
replicate as institutions choose Ethereum over alternatives for
reliability, neutrality, and minimized counterparty risk, similar to
Bitcoin's institutional appeal. Network effects compound as more
assets tokenize, rollups like Base anchor to Ethereum's security hub,
and EVM developer onboarding accelerates, with Vitalik Buterin's
rollup-centric roadmap widening Ethereum's moat rather than shrinking
it. The Ethereum Foundation appears to be "righting the ship" after
two years of struggle, as anecdotal evidence and data show
institutions defaulting to Ethereum despite crypto-native sentiment
turning bearish on L1 valuations.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LOW-RISK DEFI AS A GLOBAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 “Low-risk DeFi on Ethereum” effectively becomes a universal
savings account as anyone, anywhere can park money in dollar
stablecoins and earn ~4% onchain, versus ~0.4% in a US bank account
and often negative real yields elsewhere. By making treasury-like
returns accessible globally, Ethereum turns compounding interest from
a rich-country privilege into something available to a single mom, a
refugee, or a teenager learning finance. In that framing, the win
isn't speculative upside. Instead, it's simply letting people hold
value that keeps up with (or beats) inflation. 

 STRIPE'S USDC FEE ISN'T JUST “GAS” (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stripe isn't charging to move USDC, it's charging to wrap stablecoins
in a full payments stack (checkout UI, multi-rail routing, refunds,
fiat settlement, fraud and compliance, subscriptions, analytics, and
support) and embedding it where merchants already accept cards,
PayPal, etc. To actually undercut 1.5%, a competitor would need to
replicate that entire suite, not just accept a wallet transfer, which
is why most merchants won't roll their own crypto integration for what
is still incremental volume.

QUICK LINKS

 ETH VS ETHEREUM VALUE ACCRUAL (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 “Ultrasound Money” as a mechanical thesis is dead with Fusaka,
fees and burn are structurally lower, institutions mostly want
USD-denominated blockspace, and Ethereum's success no longer
guarantees direct value accrual to ETH. 

 AAVE V4 IN ONE MINUTE (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Aave v3 fragmented liquidity across markets. 

 SEI PARTNERS WITH XIAOMI FOR SMARTPHONE WALLETS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 All new Xiaomi phones sold outside of mainland China and the United
States will come pre-loaded with crypto apps. 

 STRIPE ACQUIRES VALORA WALLET TEAM (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Stripe acquired the team behind mobile-first self-custody wallet
Valora in an undisclosed acqui-hire as founder Jackie Bona transitions
to pursue "expanding global access to financial systems," while the
app's intellectual property returns to original developer cLabs.
