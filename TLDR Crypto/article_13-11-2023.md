 AN OPEN SOURCE SDK FOR BUILDING STABLECOIN APPLICATIONS ON THE HEDERA
NETWORK (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Hedera is a decentralized, open-source, proof-of-stake public ledger
governed by a council of leading enterprises, universities, and web3
projects [5]. Hederaâ€™s scalable and reliable network infrastructure
allows developers to deploy ecosystem-critical web3 applications and
protocols - including stablecoins.
Stablecoin Studio [5] is an open-source SDK that makes it easy to
build stablecoin applications on the Hedera network. Itâ€™s used by
web3 stablecoin platforms, institutional issuers, enterprises, and
payment providers.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 ARK INVEST, 21SHARES SLATED TO INTRO CRYPTO ETF SUITE NEXT WEEK (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ark Invest and 21Shares are planning to roll out five funds that
incorporate either bitcoin futures contracts, ether futures, or both
sometime this week. These include an ETF that leverages both BTC and
ETH futures, an Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF, and an ETF
featuring BTC futures paired with a portfolio of crypto-related
equities. While itâ€™s uncertain what kind of demand there would be
for these specific products, this could be yet another option for
retail and institutional investors to get exposure to the crypto
space. 

 JPMORGAN ADDS PROGRAMMABLE PAYMENTS TO JPM COIN (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 JPMorgan's blockchain-based settlement token, JPM Coin, now allows
users to automate payments according to preset conditions. The new
feature enables funds to be transferred automatically to cover overdue
payments or margin calls, making it unnecessary to set up standing
orders. This capability is beneficial in a 24/7 payments
infrastructure and in times when the market is especially volatile.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GEARBOX V3 WANTS TO BE THE NEXT GO-TO ON-CHAIN CREDIT LAYER (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 DeFi platform Gearbox Protocol is launching its v3 upgrade, which
includes an Onchain Credit Layer, enabling the creation of individual
credit accounts controlled by users. The system operates like an
in-store credit card, providing increased capital access across
various DeFi protocols. The upgrade comes with extra features like
adjustable collateral limits for new and large assets and a governance
and rate markets system. 

 SIGNATURE MERGING FOR LARGE-SCALE CONSENSUS (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Proof of Stake systems require optimization of the way cryptographic
signatures, used as ballots, get collected. In large P2P systems with
potentially millions of validators, aggregating bitfields is essential
for system optimization. This proposal lays out potential solutions to
the bitfield aggregation problem and three possible instantiations
using SNARKs (zk-SNARKs or 'Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive
Argument of Knowledge'), including Recursive Stark, Recursive Halo2,
and Folding. Though they are preliminary, all have advantages and
downsides in terms of merge cost, verification, and communication
overhead.

 ðŸš€Â RETAIL SUCCESS STORY IN THE MAKING (SPONSOR) [10] 

 What if you had the opportunity to invest in the biggest electronics
products before they launched into big box retail? RYSE [10], the
smart home tech company, is launching in 100+ Best Buy stores [10],
and you're in luck â€” you can still invest at only $1.25/share [10]
before their name becomes known nationwide.

 YOUR COMPLETE GUIDE TO TRADING SOLANA TOKENS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This thread provides a comprehensive guide on getting started with
on-chain trading in the Solana ecosystem. It's divided into three
sections: discovery, research, and trading. The discovery phase
involves using analytical tools to find top-performing tokens and
trends. The research phase includes examining the project's primary
resources and data points to evaluate potential purchases. Lastly, the
trading phase discusses the use of wallets and platforms like Phantom,
Jupiter, and Fluxbot for transactions and optimal execution. 

 DISCOVERING THE UNTAPPED POTENTIAL OF ARBITRUMâ€™S STYLUS (6 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Stylus' latest upgrade has expanded its capacity to accommodate not
just the EVM, but also WASM. This opens the platform up to developers
who want to use Rust, C, and C++, enhancing Stylus' scalability and
drastically reducing computation costs. The system retains its
compatibility with EVM contracts while offering improved safety
features, including additional protection against reentrancy attacks.

 THE MIDDLEWARE THESIS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article suggests that the main issue with crypto adoption isn't
scalability, but the complexity and limitations associated with
interacting with base protocol layers. Modular architecture, which
allows builders to innovate and customize on top of the base layer, is
presented as a solution. The author also emphasizes the importance of
vertically integrated middleware, offering use-case-specific protocols
and networks that could scale to millions of users. 

 ETHEREUMâ€™S FUTURE STAKING MARKET (13 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The possibility of Ether ETFs following a Bitcoin ETF approval will
likely pose new challenges to Ethereum's decentralization. As interest
in spot ETH ETFs rises, issuers may partner with third-party
centralized staking providers for staking rewards. This could
potentially increase market control by centralized entities, further
centralizing Ether staking. Decentralized protocols like Lido could
act as an effective counterbalance, successfully attracting new Ether
investors and limiting the growth of individual node operators.
