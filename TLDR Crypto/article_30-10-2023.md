 HESTER PEIRCE: SEC CASE AGAINST LBRY â€˜UNSETTLED MEâ€™ (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has expressed disagreement with the
SEC's recent case against crypto company LBRY, arguing that its
enforcement-driven approach to the crypto industry is flawed. She
questions whether the closure of LBRY, an operational company with
real-world blockchain applications, actually benefits investors or the
market. For context, Peirce has consistently advocated for a spot
bitcoin ETF and leniency towards crypto, emphasizing the need for
clear regulations before enforcement.

 5 PHASES OF THE BITCOIN HALVING (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This thread goes over the five stages of the Bitcoin Halving set for
April 2024, including how Bitcoin typically trades around its
halvings. These stages include the pre-halving period, the pre-halving
rally, pre-halving retrace, re-accumulation, and the parabolic
uptrend. Historically, retraces during the pre-halving have yielded
great returns post-halving. The re-accumulation stage often tests
investor patience, yet leads to the uptrend stage that typically sees
Bitcoin reach record highs. 

 VALUE ACCRUAL FOR ROLLUP FRAMEWORKS AND RAAS (ARE THEY GOING TO
ZERO?) (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Numerous rollup frameworks and Rollups-as-a-Service platforms have
been launched, leading many to wonder about their viability for value
accrual. Although direct value primarily accumulates at the execution
layer, rollup frameworks can acquire indirect value through widespread
use and enhancements. Some may also share revenue, facilitating
semi-direct value accumulation. Striking the right balance between
collaboration and competition will be key for these frameworks and
platforms' sustainable growth.
