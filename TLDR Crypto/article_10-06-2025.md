MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC WORKING ON 'INNOVATION EXEMPTION' FOR DEFI PLATFORMS (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced that he's directing staff to
develop an “innovation exemption” to ease developers' path for
bringing DeFi platforms and onchain financial systems to market under
adjusted rule relief. Republican commissioners argued that open-source
software creators shouldn't be held liable for user actions and
stressed accommodation for peer-to-peer blockchain applications.
Commissioner Hester Peirce cautioned that simply adding a
“decentralized” label won't shield operators from regulation,
while ShapeShift's Erik Voorhees praised the SEC's more
crypto-friendly tone. Atkins acknowledged the differences between
traditional finance and DeFi and its need for clear guidelines. 

 ETHEREUM PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO LEAD, BUT GLOBAL CRYPTO FUND INFLOWS
DECELERATE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto funds saw $286M in net inflows last week, marking eight
straight weeks of gains, though the pace is slowing as investors await
Fed policy signals. Ethereum funds led for the second week with
$296.4M in inflows, driven by U.S. spot ETFs, while Bitcoin products
saw $56.5M in outflows. Regional inflows were dominated by the U.S.,
Germany, and Switzerland, with sentiment showing divergence across
assets and geographies.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SINGAPORE'S NEW CRYPTO REGULATIONS EXPLAINED (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Singapore has a strict new licensing regime for Digital Token Service
Providers (DTSPs) that requires any crypto-related activity “in or
from” the country to be licensed regardless of whether services
target local or foreign users. The sweeping rules cover nearly all
crypto functions, from custody and trading to staking and token
issuance, with no transitional period and a low approval rate. While
licensed firms like Coinbase and OKX may benefit, unlicensed projects
and solo builders face immediate regulatory risk triggering concerns
of a Web3 exodus to jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Dubai. 

 IRIS: AN AUTONOMOUS, PUBLIC-GOOD CONTRACT AUDIT AGENT (2 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Virtuals Protocol and Nethermind are launching IRIS, an AI agent
meant to audit smart contracts and act as a public good for the
Ethereum ecosystem. This is the first AI agent launched on ETH L1,
meaning it will have a native liquidity pool on the chain. 50% of IRIS
will go to the Ethereum community, likely rewarding users for
transactions, AI adoption, and DeFi use.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE AGE OF AGENTIC CAPITAL (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Agents are autonomous AI systems that require programmable money to
transact, yet traditional financial rails impose barriers like KYC,
human-centric workflows, high fees, latency, and regulatory gaps.
Blockchain infrastructure enables decentralized identities for
verifiable agent reputations, smart contracts for programmable access
control and complex payment logic, stablecoins for seamless global
value exchange, and high-performance networks for low-cost, high-speed
microtransactions with transparent audit trails. The main risks
include rogue agent spending, cybersecurity threats to private keys,
integration friction for providers and users, and regulatory
uncertainties. 

 CIRCLE: IS IT STILL A BUY? (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Circle's IPO exploded with a +168% first-day surge and +247% gain
over 48 hours, marking the biggest first-day pop for a $1 billion+ IPO
in three decades as institutional FOMO drove opening prices from $31
to over $103. By underpricing at $31 despite market demand near $83+,
Circle forfeited $1.72 billion in capital, and its December 2025
lockup expiry looms as a source of potential insider selling pressure.
At a $23.75 billion market cap and 152x earnings multiple, nearly 90%
of revenue stems from USDC reserve interest, with Q1 2025 showing
58.5% revenue growth but 68.2% cost growth eroding margins. Although
regulatory tailwinds, institutional confidence, and USDC's role in
real-world asset settlement underpin a long-term bull case, scarce
near-term catalysts and a premium valuation suggest limited asymmetric
upside.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CHANGING ETHEREUM FOUNDATION (45 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Ethereum Foundation shared a formal Treasury Policy that sets
clear ETH-sale thresholds to maintain 2.5 years of fiat runway, an
annual spending cap tapering from 15% to 5%, DeFi and staking revenue
mandates, enhanced quarterly and annual reporting, and “DeFiPunk”
investment standards grounded in cypherpunk ideals. This structured
framework shifts the Foundation from passive asset holder to active
ecosystem steward, boosting predictability and transparency in its
financial operations. However, the policy's selective support criteria
risk centralizing influence, and its profit-oriented activities could
invite SEC scrutiny under the Howey Test. The coming months will
reveal whether the Foundation can uphold Ethereum's decentralization
ethos while managing its new, more proactive treasury. 

 ALIGNING AROUND MORPHO — THE ONLY ASSET FOR MORPHO (6 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Morpho is consolidating its ecosystem around the MORPHO token by
making Morpho Labs a wholly owned subsidiary of the nonprofit Morpho
Association, thereby aligning all contributors and token holders under
the same incentive structure. As a French nonprofit, the Association
is legally barred from external profit distribution or share sales,
ensuring every resource and protocol fee is reinvested into network
growth. This reinvestment-first stance mirrors high-growth startup
practices and positions the DAO to deploy capital for maximum
long-term impact.
