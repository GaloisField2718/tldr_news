 $1K COULD'VE MADE $2.5M — MEET THE ROAS KING OF AI MARKETING
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 A $1K investment in Nvidia in 1999 would be worth $2.5M today. Now
another early AI startup is emerging — RAD Intel, the _ROAS King_
[4], which helps Fortune 1000 brands predict performance before they
spend. 

With recurring seven-figure partnerships and valuation up 4,900%* [4],
this is the layer powering tomorrow's marketing giants, and the $RADI
NASDAQ ticker is already reserved

Backed by ADOBE and FIDELITY VENTURES, Rad Intel has over 10,000
investors, including insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CFTC PUSHING TOWARD LEVERAGED SPOT CRYPTO ADOPTION (8 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham is personally meeting with regulated
exchanges to launch leveraged spot crypto trading products by year-end
without waiting for congressional authorization, claiming existing
agency authority suffices to oversee Bitcoin and Ethereum trades on
designated contract markets. She's simultaneously restructuring the
enforcement division with a dedicated trial unit of 8-9 lawyers and
pushing toward a stablecoin collateral pilot program expected in Q2
2026 that she calls a "killer app" for the sector. Rumors indicate
Pham plans to join MoonPay as chief legal officer and chief
administrative officer after Mike Selig's confirmation as permanent
CFTC chairman, positioning the agency to claim jurisdiction over the
vast majority of digital assets that fall outside SEC oversight. 

 LEDGER CONSIDERING IPO OR FUNDRAISE (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hardware wallet maker Ledger is preparing for a New York IPO or
private fundraising round next year as the company posts triple-digit
millions in revenue during its strongest year on record, with CEO
Pascal Gauthier expanding the firm's Manhattan presence where crypto
capital is concentrated. The Paris-based company secures roughly $100
billion in bitcoin for customers and was last valued at $1.5 billion
in 2023. Demand for secure crypto storage has surged as criminals
stole $2.17 billion in the first half of 2025 alone, and physical
attacks on crypto holders escalated, including the January kidnapping
of Ledger co-founder David Balland, who had a finger severed before a
suspected orchestrator was arrested in Morocco.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 THE EVOLUTION OF STAKING: FROM CONSENSUS TO TOKENOMICS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Staking began as a Proof-of-Stake consensus tool, rewarding
validators for securing networks, but has evolved into a core
tokenomics mechanism that aligns incentives, accrues value, and
empowers governance. With the rise of liquid staking, users gained
capital efficiency while networks like Ethereum and Solana expanded
staking's utility beyond security, now serving as a foundation for
DeFi primitives and long-term holder alignment. On Solana, Jito and
Kyros are driving this next phase with customizable infrastructure for
liquid and restaking across SPL tokens, enabling projects like Nomu to
create “realStaking” models that tie rewards directly to protocol
activity instead of emissions. 

 REPUBLIC SECURES $100M ZERO-INTEREST DEAL TO BUY ETH AND SCALE
STAKING (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Vancouver-based Republic Technologies (DOCT) secured a $100 million
zero-coupon convertible note from a major institutional investor to
expand its Ethereum validator and staking operations, with over 90% of
proceeds allocated to purchasing ETH. The financing structure, which
has no interest or collateral requirements, positions Republic among a
growing group of public firms treating ETH as both a treasury asset
and yield generator. CEO Daniel Liu called Ethereum “digital fuel”
for financial systems, reflecting the firm's validator-driven treasury
model and rising institutional interest in Ethereum-based income
strategies similar to those employed by SharpLink and BitMine.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STABLECOIN AFFINITY CARDS (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Co-branded cards generate billions for airlines and hotels but remain
inaccessible to most brands due to bank balance sheet requirements,
underwriting black boxes, and reputation risks. Stablecoin-linked
cards eliminate traditional underwriting by letting users pre-fund
wallets and spend from collateralized balances, offering two paths:
low-risk debit cards monetizing yield on float plus interchange, or
collateralized credit where users borrow against yield-bearing assets
at higher risk. An emerging provider ecosystem handles custody, key
management, vault infrastructure, and regulatory compliance, giving
brands unprecedented control over economics and customer experience
while breaking free from bank constraints that limited co-branding to
Fortune 500 companies. 

 WHY MOST AIRDROPS SUCK (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most project airdrops fail because teams reward Discord activity and
testnet farming instead of users deploying real capital and generating
revenue. Teams should build products first to attract genuine TVL,
then reward actual usage based on multiple metrics rather than
launching tokens on day one as pure speculation. Marketing teams
perpetuate ineffective airdrop strategies due to a lack of expertise
or a fear of losing jobs by abandoning vanity metrics, resulting in
reputation damage that can take years to recover as real users migrate
to projects that properly identify and reward them.

 FLUID Q3 REPORT (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Fluid's unified Liquidity Layer protocol doubled its lending business
to $3.4B TVL and $1.6B in active loans while DEX volume surged 150% to
$69.2B, making it the largest DEX for pegged and correlated pairs
across major EVM chains. The protocol generated $20.5M in fees and
$3.5M in revenue as monthly active users doubled to 102K, with its
Solana deployment, Jupiter Lend, reaching $1B TVL in eight days
post-launch. The team projects a 5-10x fee and revenue growth plus 5x
volume increases in Q4 with the launch of DEX v2, which will introduce
permissionless pool creation and volatile pair trading. 

 LESS GAMBLING, MORE BUILDING: 5 AREAS OF REAL CRYPTO GROWTH (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Crypto should move away from gambling-style projects that exploit
user asymmetries and instead refocus on building systems that replace
legacy finance, not replicate its predatory mechanics. Five key
sectors shaping that future are Tokenized assets, led by firms like
Securitize and Ondo, which bring real-world financial products
onchain; Onchain capital formation, which enables global token-first
fundraising; Stablecoins and crypto neobanks, powered by projects like
EtherFi and KeetaPay; Agentic finance, where AI-driven agents execute
intent-based transactions; and Bitcoin financial products, which
unlock yield and utility for BTC holders.
