MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FED ‘HAWKISH CUT' DECREASE CHANCES OF BTC SANTA RALLY (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The Fed cut rates by 25 bps as expected, but paired it with cautious
guidance as only one more cut is penciled in for 2026. The committee
had its most dissents since 2018 (9-3 votes). Markets largely ignored
the rate cut, with BTC dropping back to ~$90k and ETH below $3.2k as
traders read the decision as a classic “hawkish cut” rather than
the start of a dovish pivot. At the same time, the Fed will buy $40B
in T-bills over the next month to keep reserves ample, adding a quiet
liquidity tailwind even as Powell stresses data-dependence. Spot BTC
ETFs continue to see healthy inflows (BlackRock added ~$193M on
Tuesday), but retail selling and macro uncertainty are keeping price
action range-bound instead of delivering the hoped-for Santa rally. 

 US SENATE'S CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE BILL GETS MESSY (6 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Senate Democrats delivered a counteroffer on crypto market structure
legislation outlining unresolved demands on financial stability
protections, ethics rules preventing elected officials from profiting
off crypto projects targeting Trump family ventures, and stablecoin
yield limits reflecting deposit flight fears from community banks. The
White House blocked ethics provisions and Democratic commissioner
nominees, according to Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, as divisions
persist over long-term CFTC/SEC oversight splits and secondary-market
protections, with Democrats rejecting markup calls despite GOP
assurances that the bill is nearly ready. The Senate has days left in
its 2025 calendar ending next week before slipping into midterm
election pressures and January 30's expiring Continuing Resolution,
risking another government shutdown, while progressive groups and
Senator Elizabeth Warren criticize the effort as threatening financial
stability despite being sidelined by Democrats negotiating directly
with Republicans.

 SURF: MAKING INVESTING AS EASY AS ASKING (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Surf AI solves crypto's education challenge as mainstream AI models,
including GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Opus, achieve under 70% accuracy
on specific crypto data queries versus Surf's multi-agent reasoning
system combining social sentiment, technical analysis, and onchain
tracking. The chatbot interface delivers verified research reports
addressing crypto's fragmented workflow, requiring manual API writing
and Dune queries, with transparent reasoning reducing hallucination
risk in a high-stakes environment where single ticker mistakes could
cost millions. Founded by serial entrepreneurs from BitTorrent,
Instagram, and Google who previously built and sold DLive and Cyber,
Surf attracted 80,000 registered users spanning institutional
investors validating theses to grassroots communities understanding
token markets. 

 OP SUCCINCT LITE IS ACTIVATED ON CELO MAINNET (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Celo activated its Jello Hardfork on mainnet, becoming the first
chain to implement OP Succinct Lite in production and launch a fully
auditable DA bridge for EigenDA, which introduces ZK-powered
non-interactive fault proofs for efficient dispute resolution. The
upgrade includes a six-member challenger set, including five
independent ecosystem participants monitoring sequencer behavior and
enforcing security guarantees as Celo moves toward L2 Beat's Stage 2
decentralization criteria. The backward-compatible activation required
no action from full nodes or developers while deploying a new
Rust-based Celo-Kona EVM client constructed using Succinct's SP1
framework. The foundation enables Celo's Layer 2 roadmap to target
greater throughput, improved Ethereum interoperability, and enhanced
finality guarantees for its mobile-friendly, low-fee payment network.

 THE INTERNET'S BLUEPRINT FOR ETHEREUM (30 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 You can't value Ethereum like a company or a normal L1. Instead, you
have to treat it like the internet's base protocols (TCP/IP, DNS). It
is a public good, so its main value comes from enabling everyone else.
Ethereum should be valued based on captured value, Ethereum-dependent
economic flow, and trust surplus. Captured value is the current market
cap of ETH + L2s + DeFi blue chips, which is ~$0.6-0.9T today.
Ethereum-dependent economic flows are like digital GDP, which is the
annual value of activity that actually relies on Ethereum (e.g.,
stablecoins, tokenized assets, DeFi, NFTs, etc. which is capitalized
at ~$0.3-3T. Trust surplus is the invisible value from lower fraud,
counterparty risk, and rent extraction. It is estimated to be around
$0.15-0.6T. 

 I DO NOT REGRET SPENDING 8 YEARS OF MY LIFE IN CRYPTO (12 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Nic Carter responds to Ken Chang's "I wasted 8 years in crypto" post
by acknowledging that crypto largely became a casino rather than the
promised financial revolution, but argues pragmatic optimism remains
justified as speculation is an inevitable externality of building
permissionless infrastructure. Chang's disillusionment mirrors Mike
Hearn's 2016 Bitcoin exit over centralization concerns, both stemming
from tension between idealistic expectations and reality, though
crypto's five teloi – sound money, smart contracts, digital
property, capital market efficiency, and global financial access –
are advancing more slowly and less dramatically than hoped. Real
progress exists in Bitcoin, stablecoins, DEXes, and prediction
markets, with increasing evidence of being on the right track,
requiring acceptance that hyperbitcoinization won't happen, most value
may accrue to corporations or consumer surplus, and the normalization
of gambling among youth is a depressing but unavoidable cost of
permissionless capital markets.

 ETHEREUM'S IRREPLICABLE MOAT & WWIII-RESISTANT SETTLEMENT (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Crypto natives are undervaluing how uniquely hard it would be to
recreate Ethereum's politically neutral, globally shared settlement
layer. The historical window that allowed Bitcoin and Ethereum to
bootstrap legitimacy with open, general-purpose launches is closed, so
new L1s are competing under very different, more financialized
conditions. Meanwhile, institutional behavior is quietly confirming
the thesis that when banks, fintechs, and tokenization projects pick a
base chain, they increasingly default to Ethereum for its reliability,
neutrality, and minimized counterparty risk. As more assets, rollups,
and devs pile onto the EVM and rollup stack, its network effects
compound, and with Fusaka as well as sharper EF execution, Ethereum's
moat is widening rather than eroding. 

 MEGAETH LIQUIDITY MINING & LIKELY TGE TIMING (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Aave's governance proposal to deploy on MegaETH reveals new details
about the chain's incentive design. Aave Labs is slated to receive 30M
MegaETH “points” for liquidity mining, with accrual and redemption
happening on MegaETH's own site at the end of each ~2-month
“season,” and eligibility restricted to KYC-verified users. If
mainnet and Season 1 incentives start around January 2026, that
schedule implies a plausible MEGA token TGE window around March or
April 2026, when Season 1 points can first be redeemed.
