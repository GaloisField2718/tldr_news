MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FIDELITY FILES FOR ETHEREUM-BASED US TREASURY FUND ‘ONCHAIN' (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Fidelity plans to register a tokenized version of its US Treasury
Digital Fund, “OnChain,” on Ethereum for improved transparency and
tracking. While the blockchain will serve as a secondary, reconciled
record of share ownership, official records will continue to be
maintained via traditional book-entry systems. If approved, it is
expected to go live on May 30. The $80 million fund is primarily
composed of US Treasury bills. 

 DYDX LAUNCHES FIRST BUYBACK PROGRAM (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The dYdX Community has launched its first-ever buyback program,
allocating 25% of net protocol fees to monthly buybacks to reduce
circulating supply and increase network security. This move aligns the
token's value with platform growth as dYdX expands its capabilities
with new features like spot trading and EVM support, reinforcing its
long-term tokenomics and sustainability.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTO THE EMBR: WHERE MEMES EVOLVE OR BURN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Embr's memecoin appchain prioritizes real, sustained demand over
arbitrary market cap milestones. It replaces traditional launchpad
methods with a two-phase system where memecoins first undergo a
trading phase for price discovery and then enter the “Chains of
Chaos” survival game to prove their worth. In this game, liquidity
is recycled and allocated to stronger memes, ensuring only those with
genuine interest survive. 

 DWF LABS LAUNCHES $250M LIQUID FUND (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 DWF Labs has launched a $250M Liquid Fund to supercharge the growth
of mid to large-cap crypto projects. DWF will provide strategic
capital and comprehensive ecosystem support, including investments,
PR, and go-to-market strategies. Over the past two weeks, the firm has
already invested over $11M and plans to finalize additional deals
worth $25M and $10M to drive sustainable Web3 innovation.

 TRADFI TOMORROW: DEFI AND THE RISE OF EXTENSIBLE FINANCE (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The current financial system is hampered by inefficiencies and DeFi
presents a transformative solution to reduce costs and unlock value.
Most respondents (of 300 TradFi professionals) believe that public,
permissionless blockchains, especially in the areas of stablecoins,
tokenized assets, and DEXs will become critical to traditional
finance, though regulatory hurdles still need to be addressed. 

 THE GREAT CRYPTO VC BUBBLE: WHY EVERY NEW TOKEN TRENDS TO ZERO (PART
1) (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The crypto VC bubble, which began during the 2021 bull market,
inflated token valuations by channeling excessive VC capital into alt
projects, ultimately setting the stage for widespread
underperformance. Following the market crashes triggered by events
like Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX, many VCs shifted from
long-term strategic investments to short-term exit strategies. This
misalignment of incentives is prompting founders and communities to
pivot toward alternative funding models, such as community-driven
fundraising and long-term liquid funds, casting doubt on the future
viability of many VC-backed projects.
