model-agnostic toolkit for giving AI agents access to any onchain
functionality alongside access to web2 APIs. Built in Python and
powered by LangChain, the goal of AgentKit is to be both powerful yet

make organizational decisions and address misaligned incentives in
DAOs. The platform creates conditional markets for proposals where
participants can trade on share prices under different outcomes,
allowing the market to determine the holders. Futarchy aims to evolve
governance into a broader system for aggregating global information
through interconnected markets.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 FROM PREDICTION MARKETS TO INFO FINANCE (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In this post, Vitalik Buterin explores the concept of “info
finance” – deliberately designed markets that elicit specific
information from participants, with prediction markets being one early
example. These systems can create better implementations of social
media, science, news, and governance through mechanisms like distilled
human judgment and decision markets. AI could enable efficient
micro-markets by solving the problem of low volume. The convergence of
scalable blockchains, growing trust issues, and AI capabilities make
this the perfect time for info finance to take off. 

 ETHEREUM FOUNDATION 2024 REPORT (20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Ethereum Foundation reported $134.9M in spending for 2023, with a
current treasury of $970.2M, 81% of which is in crypto. This year, it
introduced a new conflict of interest policy and supported the growth
of independent ecosystem organizations. $22.2B is being held across
various project treasuries across the ecosystem and nearly $500M was
deployed for ecosystem support in 2022-23.

 KAST OFFICIAL TO GO LIVE (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 KAST is launching a global on-ramp to USDC via SWIFT with fees
between 0%-0.1% and a $10k minimum. The surface will initially be
offered in Asia but the team expects to expand soon to the U.S.,
Europe, and the UAE. They hope to make stablecoin access frictionless
for compliant customers. 

 A POSITIVE PATH FORWARD (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Optimism is high for a more supportive regulatory environment in the
U.S. crypto space following recent elections. There is potential for
bipartisan progress that will enable consumer-focused innovation in
areas like digital identity, stablecoins, and decentralized networks.
Clearer rules are anticipated to support good actors while protecting
consumers, allowing projects to embrace tokens and decentralization
with greater confidence.
