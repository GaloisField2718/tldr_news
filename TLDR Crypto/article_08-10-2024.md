 BANKRUPTCY JUDGE APPROVES FTX'S REORGANIZATION PLAN (2 MINUTE READ)

 A U.S. Bankruptcy Judge approved FTX's reorganization plan, allowing
for the liquidation and partial repayment of crypto holdings to
creditors. This is all occurring about two years after FTX's initial
collapse and legal battles. Since the plan was approved, some
creditors are unhappy as they will receive about 10-25% of the current

 WHAT IS ZK COMPRESSION ON SOLANA? (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Compression is a technique that drastically
reduces the size of data stored on a blockchain like Solana without
losing any functionality. It works by creating small cryptographic
representations (hashes) of data and using zero-knowledge proofs to
verify ownership, allowing users to interact with the compressed data
while saving storage space and costs.

 GAMING TOKENS DILEMMA: DEX OR CEX? (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Gaming token projects are grappling with choosing between DEX and CEX
listings. While CEX requirements are increasingly demanding and
expensive, they offer guaranteed FDV and increased liquidity.
DEX-centric approaches and higher community allocation aim to better
support user demand and maintain their identity as gaming tokens
instead of vehicles for speculation. This debate captures the larger
issue between the accessibility of liquidity from CEXes and the higher
degree of freedom of DEXes.
