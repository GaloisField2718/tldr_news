focusing solely on the US election. It uses Chaos Labs' Edge Proof
Oracles, which use LLMs to ensure data integrity, authenticity, and
unbiased determination. Current prediction markets have issues with
human-driven systems in ambiguous situations, like the 2024 Venezuela
Election, where both sides claimed victory with data to support it.

decentralized CDN (dCDN) concept promises lower latency, increased
redundancy, and reduced costs by leveraging underutilized upload
bandwidth. Pipe aims to build the world's fastest and largest CDN,
with 3ms + speed of light response times. Its first public demo will
be released next week at Solana's Breakpoint conference.

 Ethereum is currently facing challenges like regulatory uncertainty,
competition from Solana, and declining revenues due to Layer 2 growth.
However, despite these issues, Ethereum remains dominant in key
sectors like DeFi, stablecoins, and corporate adoption, making it a
contrarian bet with potential upside. 

 BRIDGING BITCOIN (18 MINUTE READ) [9]

cultural evolutions, increasing its scalability and functionality
through upgrades like SegWit and Taproot, which have facilitated

support complex transactions and create tokens and other programmable
financial instruments directly on its blockchain.

 IS DATA AVAILABILITY A COMMODITY? DO DA LAYERS HAVE NETWORK EFFECTS?
(3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post presents numerous arguments about data availability. One
view is that it is a commodity with no network effects since rollups
don't benefit from other rollups sharing the same DA layer. Others
argue that data availability sampling and plans for interoperability
within DA layers like Avail, plus sequencing support, create strong
network effects. The author argues that neither is true, as security
trade-offs distinguish between providers, but a DA layer has little
network effects and can be overburdened if there's a global throughput
limit.

popularity can be attributed to Coinbase's reputation and exchange
integration, its focus on being consumer-ready, and the plethora of
apps on the protocol.
