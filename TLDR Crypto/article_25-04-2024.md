 US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SEEKS 3-YEAR JAIL SENTENCE FOR FORMER
BINANCE CEO CZ (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Department of Justice says that Binance CEO CZ Zhao should spend
three years in jail for money laundering charges. The sentence is

to money laundering and sanctions violations, forcing Binance to pay
$4.3 billion in penalties and barring Zhao from involvement with
Binance for at least three years. The sentencing is scheduled for
April 30th.
