 TRUMP ORDER WILL ALLOW ALTERNATIVE ASSETS LIKE CRYPTOCURRENCIES IN
401(K)S (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 President Trump will sign an executive order directing the Labor
Secretary to review ERISA fiduciary guidance so that private equity,
cryptocurrencies, real estate, and other alternative assets can be
included in 401(k) and defined-contribution plans. The move marks a
major victory for alternative asset managers after conditional 2020
and Biden-era guidance already allowed limited private market
exposure. With Americans holding about $8.7 trillion in 401(k) assets,
BlackRock and Empower are already preparing funds that allocate 5-20%
to private investments. Proponents argue that broader access can
improve diversification and long-term returns, despite higher fees,
longer lockups, and transparency concerns. 

 RIPPLE TO BUY STABLECOIN PAYMENTS FIRM RAIL FOR $200M (6 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Ripple is set to acquire Toronto-based stablecoin payments platform
Rail for $200 million. The deal is expected to close in Q4. It is part
of Ripple's strategy to deepen adoption of its newly launched RLUSD
stablecoin. Rail will augment Ripple's global payments network by
integrating fast, compliant stablecoin rails into its On-Demand
Liquidity infrastructure. This move follows Ripple's prior bid for
Circle. It is the latest development in the intensifying race among
blockchain firms to control stablecoin payment flows. By combining
Rail's payment expertise with its settlement network, Ripple aims to
accelerate stablecoin innovation in cross-border finance.

 NARRATIVE: THE PERPETUAL INFORMATION MARKET (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Narrative is a perpetual market that allows users to speculate on
trends and mindshare rather than more objective information like
prices. Its goal is to make it possible to speculate on any piece of
information. It is the latest entry to the InfoFi narrative.
Narrative's testnet deployment is live on Monad. A private beta is
available for interested users. 

 BOROS: INTRODUCING FUNDING FUTURES (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Boros is a new protocol from the Pendle team that lets users trade
and hedge funding-rate yields on BTC and ETH via Yield Units (YUs),
each representing the yield from one unit of the underlying asset
until maturity. By allowing traders to go long or short YUs and
providing isolated liquidity pools (exLSTs), it introduces a
standardized, trustless way to fix or speculate on funding exposure.
Over time, Boros aims to become a core pillar of onchain yield markets
and extend beyond funding rates to bonds, equities, and other
real-world assets. Initially capped at $10 million open interest per
market and 1.2x leverage, Boros supports Binance BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT
funding rates, with vaults offering PENDLE incentives, swap fees, and
implied APR gains.

 UNVEILING THE PREDICTION MARKET FOREST (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Onchain order-book data from Polymarket between April 2024 and April
2025 reveals persistent pricing inefficiencies. Leveraging heuristics
and LLM-assisted semantic matching, this research classifies
mispricings into intra-market “Market Rebalancing” and
cross-market “Combinatorial” arbitrage, scanning 17,218
conditions. Opportunities surfaced in 7,051 single-condition and 662
multi-condition markets, with 11 logically linked market pairs
enabling cross-market trades. Onchain activity shows arbitrageurs have
already extracted about $40 million, highlighting both the scale of
inefficiency and the corrective role of sophisticated traders in
decentralized prediction markets. 

 THE COMET CRYPTO PORTFOLIO EXPERIMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Comet, Perplexity's browser agent, was put to the test of creating a
crypto portfolio and investing on Coinbase. It collected market
information using various news sources and pricing data and organized
it into a digestible format. Comet then navigated to Coinbase and
started making trades based on its analysis, marking the first agentic
trading on Coinbase. The portfolio includes BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA, and
XRP.

 “MONEY 3.0” THESIS FOR STABLECOINS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Stablecoins mark a foundational shift from batch-based legacy finance
to real-time, programmable money, creating new markets and value
layers. There are four core layers in the stablecoin stack: issuance
(where trust lives), infrastructure, orchestration, and distribution.
While most builders chase the middle layers, the most defensible value
lies at the edges, specifically issuer network effects and end-user
distribution scale. The stablecoin market cap is at $232B and
projected to hit $400B by year-end. 

 BOROS LETS TRADERS HEDGE FUNDING RATES WITH FIXED-RATE YU TOKENS (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Boros' YU tokens are fixed-rate instruments that let long and short
traders hedge volatile funding rates. In bull markets, longs pay high
funding - buying YU at a fixed rate locks in costs. Shorts in bear
markets can sell YU to fix incoming funding gains. Basis traders
(e.g., long spot + short perp) can use short YU to preserve favorable
funding without closing positions, especially relevant for protocols
like Ethena. While Boros is early and short-YU demand dominates, it
reflects smart yield engineering for the growing perp ecosystem.
