 2022 SEED STAGE RETROSPECTIVE BY LATTICE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The 2nd annual State of Seed report analyzed over 1,000 companies
that raised seed rounds in 2022, tracking their progress in finding
product-market fit, raising follow-on funding, and launching tokens.
Key findings show that around 80% of these companies are still
operational, though only 1% have reached product-market fit,
highlighting the risks of investing at the end of a bull market. 

 WTF IS DATA AVAILABILITY? (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Transaction history is stored in a Data Availability (DA) layer while
proofs of execution are sent to settlement layers like Ethereum. This
post outlines the properties of different DA solutions, including
capacity, cost, security, and ease of integration. There is a trend
towards alternative DA solutions like Celestia and EigenDA as they
offer improved scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to
Ethereum.

 5 PILLARS OF PRODUCT-MARKET FIT IN WEB3 (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Web3, specifically tokens, allows for behavior incentivization and
driving users to network effects in a way never before seen, so
understanding the value of a token is critical. Maximize your win rate
with the most creative, innovative companies in your industry as
customers or partners. The smartest users and customers in a space are
important to understand and build for as they pull the whole market
with them. It is important to separate power users from regular users
or airdrop farmers and invest your tokens and grants wisely. 

 DECENTRALISE TETHER AND CIRCLE, A LIGHT RESEARCH ON $M AND M^0
PROTOCOL (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The M^0 Protocol introduces a novel, decentralized approach to
stablecoin management that allows multiple permissioned institutions
to mint $M tokens by locking off-chain collateral. It uses two
governance tokens, $POWER and $ZERO, to manage governance and
encourage active participation. $POWER holders earn $ZERO, which earns
protocol fees, by being active governance participants. The M^0
Protocol is still small, with $42 million $M stablecoins in
circulation, but a 127% collateralization ratio implies the product
has potential for both network effects and resilience.
