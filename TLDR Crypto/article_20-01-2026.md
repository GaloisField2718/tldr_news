 NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE DEVELOPS TOKENIZED SECURITIES PLATFORM (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The New York Stock Exchange is developing a platform for trading and
onchain settlement of tokenized securities that will enable 24/7
operations, instant settlement, fractional share trading, and
stablecoin-based funding. Subject to regulatory approvals, the
platform will combine NYSE's Pillar matching engine with
blockchain-based post-trade systems that support multiple chains, and
will create a new NYSE venue for tokenized shares fungible with
traditional securities as well as natively-issued digital securities.
Tokenized shareholders will receive traditional dividends and
governance rights. The initiative is part of parent company ICE's
broader digital strategy to prepare its clearing infrastructure for
24/7 trading. 

 BITCOIN SLIDES ON US-EU TARIFF-WAR FEARS; NYSE TRADING PLATFORM (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bitcoin fell back toward $92,000, sparking over $750M in long
liquidations, as Greenland-linked US-EU tariff-war headlines hit a
market already weakened by delays to US crypto market structure
legislation and broader crypto-specific underperformance. The NYSE is
also developing a 24/7 platform for trading and onchain settlement of
tokenized US equities and ETFs, targeting fractional trading, instant
settlement, and stablecoin-funded flows pending regulatory approval.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHEREUM SELF-SOVEREIGNTY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Vitalik Buterin outlines an ambitious 2026 roadmap to reverse a
decade of centralization drift in Ethereum's infrastructure and user
experience. Core technical initiatives include ZK-EVM and BAL to
reduce full node requirements, Helios for trustless RPC verification,
ORAM/PIR for privacy-preserving data queries, and social recovery
wallets with timelocks to eliminate seed phrase dependency without
introducing custodial backdoors. The plan also addresses privacy
censorship resistance through ERC-4337 mempool integration with native
account abstraction (AA) and FOCIL, alongside IPFS-based decentralized
application interfaces. 

 ETHEREUM EMERGES AS THE INSTITUTIONAL BACKBONE FOR TOKENIZED FINANCE
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post highlights 35 recent examples of global institutions
building on Ethereum's stack, spanning tokenized stocks and ETFs,
money market funds, deposit tokens, stablecoins, AI-driven payments,
and 24/7 settlement across banks, asset managers, fintechs, and Big
Tech. Ethereum is the preferred base layer and L2 ecosystem for
regulated tokenization, staking products, and programmable capital. It
is the settlement rail for institutions moving real-world assets and
financial infrastructure onchain at scale.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT IF YOU COULD SPEND CRYPTO LIKE CASH? (SPONSOR) [9] 

 There's plenty of cards that help you save crypto. AMARA [10] lets
you spend it. Built on the $EMBR token, AMARA offers a
charge-card-based spend layer funded by card receivables. Early
investors can earn bonus shares and priority access to $EMBR. Invest
now [10] 

 MORPHO 2026 (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Morpho scaled from 67,000 to 1.4M+ users in 2025, with deposits
growing from $5B to $13B and active loans reaching $4.5B, powered by
major institutional integrations including Coinbase's crypto-backed
loans (DeFi's largest integration to date), plus Crypto.com, Gemini,
Societe Generale Forge, and Bitget. RWA deposits surged from near-zero
to $400M by Q3 2025, signaling accelerating institutional adoption.
Most large institutions now have active DeFi teams and research, with
2026 expected to convert this interest into concrete deployment. 

 HOW TO RESTRUCTURE DAT COMPANIES IN 2026 (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Cantor Fitzgerald's initiation of coverage on single-token DATs like
PURR and HYPD (both holding Hyperliquid's HYPE) represents the most
detailed Wall Street sell-side research on an individual crypto asset
to date, enabled by banks' ability to profit from trading DAT equities
rather than tokens directly. The DAT structure solves a critical
incentive misalignment by creating equity vehicles that attract
institutional and retail capital more effectively than raw tokens.
However, DATs face a fundamental conflict between their dual mandate
of accumulating tokens at low prices while simultaneously driving
token appreciation for NAV growth.

 THE HIDDEN DANGERS & COSTS OF TOKENIZED ASSETS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Tokenized gold products PAXG and XAUT suffer from exponential
slippage, while CME Gold Futures maintain under 3 bps slippage at $20M
– a liquidity gap of multiple orders of magnitude. Two Binance PAXG
flash events in mid-October 2025 cascaded through oracle dependencies
to liquidate $6.84M in longs and $2.37M in shorts on Hyperliquid.
Market makers face structural barriers, including 10-50 bps minting
fees, KYC/custodian requirements, and T+1 to T+5 redemption windows
that make tokenized asset inventory effectively illiquid. 

 VITALIK CALLS FOR “BETTER DAOS” BEYOND TOKEN-HOLDER VOTING (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Vitalik Buterin argues today's token-holder voting DAOs are
inefficient and vulnerable to capture, and says the ecosystem needs
different and better DAO designs that actually address the weaknesses
of human politics. He points to higher-stakes needs like better oracle
architectures for stablecoins and prediction markets, onchain dispute
resolution, curated security lists, fast funding for short-term
efforts, and long-term maintenance, while calling out privacy and
decision fatigue as the two biggest blockers that ZK (for private
governance) and selectively used AI (to reduce fatigue without
replacing human judgment) could help solve.
