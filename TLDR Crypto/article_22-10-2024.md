 VANECK ADDS STAKING REWARDS TO SOLANA INVESTMENT PRODUCT IN EUROPE (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 VanEck has improved its Solana ETN in Europe to offer investors
staking rewards that are reinvested daily, providing a new form of
passive income. However, in the U.S., regulatory constraints prevent
such offerings in crypto ETFs, although approval is anticipated as
inevitable and potentially influenced by the upcoming presidential
election. The overall development highlights the differing regulatory
approaches between the EU and the U.S., with asset managers like
VanEck awaiting U.S. approval for similar products amidst growing
interest in Solana-based investments. 

 BITCOIN HASHRATE HITS ALL-TIME HIGH AS PUBLICLY-LISTED MINERS' SHARE
OF THE NETWORK PEAKS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bitcoin's hash rate has reached a new all-time high of 703 EH/s, a
13% increase since the April 2024 halving. Publicly listed mining
companies control 28.9% of the total hash rate. With BTC's price
appreciation and increased transaction fees from Runes, mining
profitability has increased, with the hash price reaching $50 per
PH/s. The growing computational power will result in an approximately
4% difficulty increase on October 23.

 NODEKIT AND THE NEW SUPERBUILDERS PARADIGM (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nodekit is a new solution to the L2 user and liquidity fragmentation
problem. Its Javelin product constructs blocks for multiple chains
simultaneously, unifying liquidity and eliminating the need for
bridging. Nodekit could also facilitate complex cross-chain
interactions, chain abstractions, and multi-chain apps. It will
compete with the Agglayer and Superchain interoperability solutions. 

 INTRODUCING SCROLL'S FIRST AIRDROP: A CELEBRATION OF THE GLOBAL
COMMUNITY (12 MINUTE READ) [8]

to reward contributors who have supported its growth across various
categories (e.g., on-chain participants, ecosystem project builders,
industry contributors, and global community members). This initiative

and incentivizing participation in Scroll's protocol and community.

 PHANTOM TOKENOMICS, INSIDE THE OBSCURE DAEDALUS LABYRINTH (16 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This post exposes the prevalence of hidden “backdoor token deals”
in the crypto industry. It introduces the concept of “phantom
tokenomics” to describe how onchain tokenomics often misrepresent
the accurate offchain distribution. There are various types of these
deals, including advisory allocations, market-making allocations, and
OTC rounds, all of which can alter the real tokenomics of a project.
Founders should enhance transparency with onchain vesting contracts,
locking insiders' staking rewards, and focus on product development
over exchange listings.

 BUILDING A BIGGER, BETTER BRIDGE (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stripe is acquiring Bridge to accelerate stablecoins' global adoption
and utility. The company aims to make money easier to move, store, and
spend worldwide. Both companies share a vision of transforming global
finance through stablecoin infrastructure, and together, they plan to
solve bigger problems and support more developers, consumers, and
businesses worldwide. 

 AVAX VALUE CAPTURE PROBLEM (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Even with the Off the Grid game reaching hundreds of thousands of
users, Avalanche struggles to capture value from its pay-as-you-go for
L1 offerings. This model makes Avalanche attractive for new L1
deployments, particularly in gaming and institutional sectors.
However, this comes at the cost of reduced revenue capture, especially
as the main C-Chain activity has declined. The pivot to becoming a hub
for L1s, while compelling for demand, compromises long-term value
accrual.
