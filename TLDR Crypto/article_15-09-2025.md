MARKETS & BUSINESS

 POLYMARKET AND KALSHI EYE MULTI-BILLION VALUATIONS (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Prediction market giants Polymarket and Kalshi are preparing new
funding rounds at high valuations. Polymarket is planning to raise at
$9-10B, and Kalshi at $5B. Polymarket, fresh off receiving CFTC
clearance to relaunch in the U.S., is scaling quickly with global
pseudonymous trading on Polygon and USDC settlements, while Kalshi
remains a CFTC-regulated U.S. platform requiring fiat deposits and
KYC. 

 NATIVE MARKETS CLAIMS HYPERLIQUID'S USDH TICKER (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 After a contentious community voting process, Native Markets has
secured the USDH ticker for Hyperliquid's US dollar-pegged stablecoin.
The rollout will begin with a testing phase featuring capped
transactions, followed by the opening of the USDH/USDC spot order book
and the removal of transaction caps. The selection process has drawn
criticism from industry executives who alleged a predetermined outcome
favoring Native Markets, suggesting controversy around what was
presented as an open competitive process among multiple stablecoin
issuers, including established players like Paxos, BitGo, and Ethena.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 TETHER ANNOUNCES PLANS TO LAUNCH USAT, A U.S.-COMPLIANT STABLECOIN (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tether will launch USAT, a U.S.-compliant stablecoin issued through
Anchorage Digital and backed by Cantor Fitzgerald, marking its first
regulated entry into the American market. Designed as a
“hedge-and-expand” strategy, USAT provides a compliance-first
option for banks, fintechs, and corporates under the GENIUS Act, while
USDT continues to serve offshore, permissionless markets. The move
directly challenges Circle's USDC by eroding its positioning as the
regulated dollar token of choice, raising the stakes in the ongoing
battle for distribution and integrations. 

 ETHEREUM FOUNDATION SETS END-TO-END PRIVACY ROADMAP (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The Ethereum Foundation's Privacy & Scaling Explorations team has
rebranded to Privacy Stewards of Ethereum (PSE), releasing a roadmap
for building full end-to-end privacy on Ethereum. The plan focuses on
private writes (cheap, seamless private transactions), private reads
(blockchain access without exposing user identity or intent), and
private proving (fast, accessible zero-knowledge proofs).

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 A TECHNICAL TYPOLOGY OF PREDICTION MARKETS (25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Prediction markets break down into five key design dimensions,
revealing the complex tradeoffs platforms make when balancing
decentralization, efficiency, and user experience. This typology
covers outcome resolution methods (oracle-based, like Polymarket vs
human-reviewed, like Kalshi vs automated feeds), liquidity models
(AMMs used by XO Market vs order books used by evolved Polymarket vs
hybrid approaches by Kalshi), event creation mechanisms
(platform-curated vs user-generated vs community-vetted), market types
(binary vs multi-outcome vs scalar markets like Trepa's
precision-based approach), and underlying infrastructure (off-chain vs
onchain vs hybrid). Analysis reveals that successful prediction
markets must solve the fundamental liquidity problem while making
strategic choices about centralization versus decentralization, with
platforms like Kalshi prioritizing regulatory compliance and
institutional liquidity, while fully onchain protocols like Augur
emphasize censorship resistance and trustlessness. There is no single
"best" prediction market design, as the optimal approach depends
entirely on target audience, use case, and tolerance for trade-offs,
with innovation continuing across multiple dimensions as the ecosystem
matures. 

 FED, DATS, AND NPM (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Coinbase Institutional's Weekly Market Commentary anticipates a 25
basis point Federal Reserve rate cut on September 17, driven by
weakening labor and housing markets, though persistent core services
and shelter costs make a more aggressive 50 basis point cut unlikely
despite August's 0.4% month-over-month CPI increase. Digital Asset
Tokens (DATs) have entered a "Player versus Player" phase with market
Net Asset Values compressing toward 1 and trading volumes cooling,
though NAV and supply share continue rising, indicating sustained
institutional interest despite reduced speculative premiums. There is
intense competition for Hyperliquid's USDH stablecoin partnership,
with issuers proposing to share 95-100% of reserve yields, potentially
redirecting $200-220 million annually and enhancing HYPE token value
through buybacks and burns, with a final vote scheduled for September
14.

 FIXED YIELD WILL BE DEFI'S TROJAN HORSE FOR TRADFI (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Fixed yield products represent DeFi's institutional adoption strategy
by offering predictable cash flows that traditional finance already
understands, with Ethereum-based fixed yields delivering 8-15% APY
compared to T-Bills' 3-5% returns across a $33.2 trillion market.
Pendle's yield trading mechanism splits yield-bearing assets into
yield tokens (YT) and principal tokens (PT), mirroring the familiar
bond structure of separating coupons from principal while leveraging
code enforcement and onchain settlement rather than relying on
distressed issuers or opaque IOUs. The yield trading market has scaled
to over $10 billion in TVL with $100 million in daily volume, with
Pendle settling more than $54 billion in fixed yield derivatives
across ETH derivatives, stablecoins, and real-world assets.
Institutional demand for stable, predictable onchain yield is expected
to grow following the GENIUS Act passage and corporate exploration of
stablecoins by companies like Walmart and Amazon, positioning fixed
yield as the anchor for onchain finance, similar to how Treasuries
anchor traditional finance. 

 STABLECOINS FLIP THE REMITTANCE MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stablecoins are transforming remittances by letting senders transfer
USD directly, leaving recipients to decide when (or if) to convert
into local currency. This shift offers greater flexibility, stability,
and utility while moving FX revenues downstream from traditional
remittance firms to wallets and neobanks. In markets like Argentina,
businesses already hold stablecoin treasuries, signaling where
consumer adoption is headed.
