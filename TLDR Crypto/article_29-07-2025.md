 SOLANA CO-FOUNDER CALLS MEMECOINS, NFTS ‘DIGITAL SLOP' (5 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Solana co‑founder Anatoly Yakovenko labeled memecoins and NFTs
“digital slop” with no intrinsic value, comparing them to
exploitative loot boxes, prompting Base creator Jesse Pollak to
counter that the content itself can hold fundamental worth. Yakovenko
conceded memecoin activity was crucial to Solana's rise but argued it
was akin to Apple's revenues from loot boxes rather than meaningful
innovation. Data shows memecoins made up 62 % of Solana dApp revenue
in June and drove roughly $1.6 billion in H1 2025. Pump.fun and
PumpSwap have captured most of the market share, though rivals like
LetBonk are now challenging their dominance in 24‑hour launchpad
revenue. 

 BERNSTEIN HIGHLIGHTS RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES AS ETH TREASURIES GROW
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The rapid growth of Ethereum treasury companies (holding around 0.9%
of total ETH supply) is a key driver of fresh demand for Ethereum,
fueled by corporate interest in staking yields. While this model
offers potential annual yields of 3-5%, it introduces liquidity
concerns and smart contract risks. Successful adoption depends heavily
on prudent risk management amid regulatory clarity, stablecoin
expansion, and asset tokenization.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 THE NEW ECONOMIC STACK FOR CREATORS (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The creator economy's core problem is misaligned economics, while new
onchain primitives like tips, collectibles, and content coins
rebalance flows among creators, fans, and platforms. Tipping tools
like Noice and Tipn turn engagement into programmable micro‑payments
but lack shared upside – Farcaster's 1‑of‑1 collectibles route
90% of auction proceeds to creators, yet only one collector benefits.
Content coins pair media with ERC‑20s to reward early belief and
scale with distribution, though they import memecoin‑style
speculation that UX choices try to soften. The real unlock is
programmability and interoperability: tips, collectibles, and coins
can compose into access, loyalty, and revenue‑sharing layers,
pointing to a modular stack where creators define their own economics
and value moves openly across the web. 

 METAMASK LAUNCHES STABLECOIN EARN ON MOBILE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 MetaMask Mobile now offers “Stablecoin Earn,” letting users earn
passive income by depositing USDC, USDT, or DAI directly into Aave
without leaving the wallet. The feature has no fees or lock-ups,
provides aTokens in return, and allows one-click withdrawals, all
while keeping full self-custody and avoiding KYC.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 SOLANAS 'CRIME GAP' (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Solana's recent onchain activity is propped up by
“crime”‑driven mechanics like bundled tokens, insider trading,
and engineered liquidity rather than organic demand, masking
deteriorating network health. This “crime gap” parallels
historical market manipulations like the Sumitomo Copper Affair and is
destined to collapse once fresh capital inflows wane. As macro
pressures mount and artificial supports fail, a rapid capital exit
will likely ensue, leaving memecoin insiders to extract remaining
value. Ultimately, the cycle will pendulum back toward
utility‑focused projects on more robust chains as raw casino‑style
speculation loses its late‑cycle edge. 

 WHAT I LEARNT SPEAKING TO 100 DEFI STARTUPS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Every DeFi pitch hinges on two questions: “Is this app worth
building?” and “Can this team execute it?” Founders must lead
with a clear hook, justify why now, articulate a smooth user journey,
nail a focused wedge, and inject creative UX to stand out. Execution
then depends on acknowledging risks, prioritizing live demos over
decks, showcasing unique team expertise, and laying out a phased,
strategy‑driven roadmap.

 BUILDING A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR ONCHAIN INNOVATION (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Repealing the IRS “DeFi Broker Rule,” passing the GENIUS Act and
the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, plus an SEC “innovation
exemption” proposal, signals that regulators are engaging, but rules
must balance consumer protection with innovation. Policymakers should
both acknowledge DeFi's self‑custodial, permissionless architecture
and set clear standards, focusing on three gaps: outcome-based
disclosures (how it works, what can fail, who controls what, and who's
accountable), control-based liability, and pragmatic compliance for
self-custodial systems. Existing laws can still address fraud,
manipulation, and sanctions evasion without compromising trustless
design. Thoughtful frameworks can make onchain markets safer, more
sustainable, and institution-ready. 

 AAVE CUTS EMISSIONS AGAIN, TREASURY TURNS TOKEN-POSITIVE (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Aave DAO voted to reduce AAVE token emissions by another 25% while
keeping buybacks steady, making the protocol even more net
token-accretive. Since initiating the buyback program, the treasury's
cash reserves have grown 20%, and the DAO now holds 66,512 AAVE with a
37.49% unrealized gain. This strengthens long-term sustainability and
could pave the way for Anti-GHO proposals outlined in Aavenomics.
