INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 MAMO-1: CELESTIA'S 128MB BLOCK TESTNET (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Celestia's mamo-1 boasts 21.33MB/s throughput, over 16 times higher
than the current mainnet. It uses the Vacuum! protocol, a pull-based
broadcast tree mechanism, to efficiently propagate data across the
network. mamo-1 allows high-throughput applications like ZK rollups
and onchain games to be built using modular architectures. 

 CDP WALLETS (ALPHA) LIVE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Coinbase just launched CDP Wallets (Alpha), ultra-fast,
developer-custodied wallets secured by Trusted Execution Environments

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 EXPLAINER THREAD ON ZK (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Zero-knowledge (zk) technology lets users prove facts, such as being
over 18 or having a valid ticket, without revealing personal data,
enabling a more private and secure internet. Beyond privacy, zk also
boosts blockchain efficiency by verifying small proofs instead of
every transaction, unlocking applications like anonymous voting,
cheat-proof games, and decentralized identity. This is all achieved
without needing to share sensitive info. 

 HOW TO READ A STABLECOIN ATTESTATION REPORT (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stablecoin attestation reports offer a snapshot verification by
independent auditors that confirm a stablecoin's circulating supply is
backed by liquid, real-world assets. They detail reserve composition,
methodology, and exclusions, providing essential transparency to
investors and regulators. As point-in-time checks, they do not replace
comprehensive audits, but are useful for anyone holding stablecoins
who wants to understand their composition.

 CRYPTO IS GROWING UP, VCS ARE GETTING LEFT BEHIND (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Crypto is maturing beyond its hype-driven, speculative past into a
more disciplined, fundamentals-focused industry. The industry
increasingly demands longer time horizons, product-market fit before
token launches, and genuine utility. Most traditional crypto VC firms,
built for quick liquidity via SAFTs and early TGEs, are unprepared for
this shift, while firms with patient capital, governance expertise,
and IPO-readiness are positioned to lead the next wave of sustainable
growth. 

 ACCELERATE ASIA STABLECOINS WITH INTEROPERABILITY (30 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Stablecoin adoption is accelerating across Asia, fueled by supply
growth and user engagement alongside emerging regulatory clarity. Each
region has a unique strategy, with Japan and Hong Kong driving
government-led initiatives, Singapore leveraging institutional
support, and Korea focusing on retail adoption, while China and India
prioritize CBDCs. Interoperability is necessary for scaling stablecoin
usage, with protocols like LayerZero allowing for unified supply
management and secure cross-chain transfers.
