 SEC OPENS PUBLIC COMMENTS ON FRANKLIN TEMPLETON AND HASHDEX SPOT
BITCOIN ETFS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The SEC is inviting public commentary on pending ETF applications
from Franklin Templeton and Hashdex. This unexpected early request,
coming two weeks after the SEC extended the decision deadline,
suggests potential approvals in early January. However, swift approval
might not necessarily mean immediate launches. The SEC is also seeking
feedback on market manipulation susceptibility, liquidity, pricing
mechanisms, and other concerns regarding the proposed ETFs. 

 COINBASE MIGHT BE FORCED TO SHARE YOUR BITCOIN TRADING DATA WITH THE
CFTC (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Coinbase has reportedly alerted an unspecified number of its users
that their account information may be shared with the CFTC following a
subpoena linked to another crypto exchange, Bybit. The nature of the

Some Coinbase users who have not used Bybit claim they were also
targeted. Coinbase plans to engage with the CFTC to limit the scope of
shared data.

 This essay from Arthur Hayes explains how China, pegging its currency
to a weakening US dollar, can now create yuan credit without
