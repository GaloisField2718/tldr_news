 BTCS TO PAY FIRST-EVER ETHER DIVIDEND (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 BTCS Inc., a Nasdaq-listed Ethereum treasury, has announced the
first-ever ETH dividend of $0.05 per share payable in ETH or cash,
with shareholders required to opt in by the September 26 record date,
alongside a $0.35 per share loyalty payment in ETH for those
transferring holdings to book entry and maintaining them for at least
120 days through January 26, 2026. The initiative aims to reward
long-term investors and deter short selling by making shares harder to
borrow, addressing a perceived disconnect between the company's $6.65
per share balance sheet value in cash and digital assets and its
market price below $5. 

 PUMP.FUN RECLAIMS 90% OF SOLANA MEMECOIN MARKET (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pump.fun has increased from 5% to 90% market share in Solana memecoin
launches within two weeks. Rival LetsBonk's share collapsed to 3%. Top
deployers shifting platforms, bot-driven activity, and Pump.fun's
multimillion-dollar PUMP token buybacks are all considered drivers of
the reversal.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 O-COMMERCE: THE NEXT ITERATION OF E-COMMERCE (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 O-commerce represents the evolution of e-commerce through
blockchain-enabled transactions that are natively global, faster,
cheaper, non-custodial, and composable, with emerging solutions like
debit earning on idle capital, onchain yield savings, zero-interest
credit, and AI-managed payments. The Coinbase Commerce Protocol,
partnered with Shopify, introduces programmable escrow for stablecoin
payments, allowing instant onchain authorization and capture upon
order fulfillment, which reduces settlement times from days to seconds
and significantly lowers processing costs for merchants. Stablecoin
adoption could substantially boost company market caps by mitigating
card processing fees. For consumers, o-commerce provides benefits like
native yield on capital, composable rewards, global access, and
non-custodial ownership. O-commerce is expected to gradually absorb
traditional e-commerce without noticeable disruption. 

 EARN SOL FOR YOUR TRANSACTIONS WITH HELIUS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Helius has launched a SOL rebate system that allows users to earn 50%
of the MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) generated by their transactions
through post-trade backrunning opportunities. Users can opt-in by
simply adding a "rebate-address" parameter to their RPC calls, after
which their transactions enter a private auction where vetted, KYC'd
searchers bid to backrun trades that create arbitrage opportunities.
The system ensures user transactions execute first in bundles before
any searcher activity, and rebates are paid automatically in SOL
within the same block as execution. This is a novel approach to MEV
sharing that allows users to monetize the price inefficiencies their
trades create across decentralized exchanges, rather than having this
value captured entirely by searchers and validators.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHY PENDLE IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Pendle has completed all VC token unlocks as of 2021, eliminating
future selling pressure, while 35% of its supply remains locked in
vePENDLE staking that generates $2M monthly in protocol fees for
holders from its $8.7B TVL and $56.85M yearly revenue. The protocol
recently launched Boros, the first onchain funding rate trading
platform that allows leveraged exposure to funding rates without
holding underlying assets, targeting the $80B Bitcoin futures market
currently dominated by centralized exchanges. Boros is scaling
gradually from $20M to planned $25M+ market caps, with revenue
projections suggesting $32M annually if capturing just 1% of the total
crypto derivatives market through its 0.2% closing fees. The thesis
positions Pendle as infrastructure poised to disrupt centralized
derivatives trading, similar to how Uniswap captured spot trading
volume from traditional exchanges, with current fundamentals showing
genuine revenue generation rather than typical DeFi ponzinomics. 

 THE EVM IS WALL STREET'S NEW MICROSOFT EXCEL (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Circle's Arc is an EVM-compatible L1 chain with 20 permissioned
validators from regulated institutions. Stripe is building its own L1
called Tempo, likely using Paradigm's RETH client. While it remains
uncertain whether these corporate chains will issue tokens or
encourage external developer adoption, they represent a significant
expansion of Ethereum Virtual Machine usage into traditional finance.
TradFi companies are increasingly required to hire EVM developers as
the technology becomes essential infrastructure, similar to how
Microsoft Excel became ubiquitous in finance. This trend of EVM
adoption by major financial institutions potentially creates indirect
value capture for ETH as the central asset of the Ethereum ecosystem.

 PRIVACY'S REAL PRODUCT-MARKET FIT LIES IN SERIOUS FINANCE (1 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 While privacy hasn't found strong adoption in early “degen”
crypto use cases, it is essential for mainstream financial activity
where public transactions would be unacceptable (e.g., credit cards).
The open question is whether privacy will be enforced via custodians,
as in TradFi, or achieved through compliant onchain solutions. 

 ERC-8004: TRUSTLESS AGENTS FOR ETHEREUM'S AI FUTURE (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 ERC-8004 extends the Agent-to-Agent protocol with onchain registries
for identity, reputation, and validation, letting autonomous agents
transact without pre-existing trust. The proposal envisions Ethereum
as the neutral part for a machine economy where millions of AI agents
coordinate, negotiate, and form coalitions anchored to an
incorruptible ledger. By embedding trust into Ethereum rather than
centralized servers, ERC-8004 sets the foundation for AI-native
commerce and cross-service automation.
