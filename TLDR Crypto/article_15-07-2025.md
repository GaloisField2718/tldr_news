MARKETS & BUSINESS

 NASDAQ-LISTED COMPANY TO LAUNCH HYPE TREASURY (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Nasdaq-listed Sonnet BioTherapeutics has agreed to merge with
Rorschach I LLC to become Hyperliquid Strategies, creating a public
crypto treasury company that will hold 12.6 million HYPE tokens and
$305 million in cash for a total value of $888 million. The
transaction includes strategic investors Paradigm, Galaxy Digital,
Pantera Capital, D1 Capital, Republic Digital, and 683 Capital,
addressing institutional demand for exposure to Hyperliquid. Sonnet
shares surged 300% in pre-market trading following the announcement,
mirroring the market's enthusiasm for HYPE treasury strategies after
Lion Group's similar $600 million initiative in June. 

 COINBASE HITS $100B MARKET CAP AS BTC BREAKS $122K ATH (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Coinbase closed at an all-time high of $394.01 on Monday, pushing its
market cap past $100 billion for the first time. The exchange's
momentum is driven by bullish macro conditions, Circle's IPO, and its
recent S&P 500 inclusion. Bernstein has labeled Coinbase the “Amazon
of crypto financial services” with a $510 price target.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 OKX JOINS GLOBAL DOLLAR NETWORK, ADDS PAXOS' USDG STABLECOIN (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OKX has joined the Global Dollar Network (GDN) and integrated USDG, a
yield-sharing, fully backed stablecoin issued by Paxos, now live on
Ethereum, Solana, and Ink. With $357M USDG in circulation, GDN
incentivizes adoption by redistributing stablecoin revenues to
ecosystem partners, setting it apart from USDC and USDT. OKX's 60M
users can now access USDG with free 1:1 USD conversions, as regulatory
clarity grows with the GENIUS Act advancing in the U.S. House. 

 WHY FINTECHS ARE LAUNCHING THEIR OWN BLOCKCHAINS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Fintechs like Robinhood, Coinbase, Kraken, and possibly Stripe are
exploring their own blockchains to unlock platform-level control,
improve UX, and capture ecosystem value. By owning the chain, they can
natively integrate third-party apps, monetize gas and MEV, and expand
asset access without backend complexity. With modular infra from tools
like Gelato and Conduit, launching a chain now requires less
engineering, giving fintechs strategic leverage across revenue,
distribution, and regulation.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 RISE OF DEFI AI AGENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI Agents in DeFi are automated yield optimizers that outperform
rule-based systems by making responsive allocation decisions across
whitelisted vaults, with stablecoin-focused AI Agent TVL reaching $20M
by June, primarily on Base. Giza's Arma Agents grew from $200k to
$11.2M TVL with 33,000 agents processing $324M in volume, while Brahma
and Fungi Agents reached $9.5M and $412k TVL, respectively. These
execution agents rely on risk curators like Gauntlet, who design and
manage vaults for risk-adjusted yield, addressing the increased smart
contract risks that come with adding an autonomous agent layer to DeFi
protocols. 

 NOTES ON LIFE, CRYPTO, & MARKETS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A 3-month social media break revealed dopamine withdrawal after 6
years of posting, coinciding with crypto's identity crisis as it
shifts from a standalone industry to enabling technology for AI,
consumer, art, and finance. The author's current long positions
include HYPE, BTC, HOOD, ETH, EUL, and PRIME, with particular focus on
the AI x crypto intersection as the most compelling opportunity.
Attention span has emerged as the biggest edge in creating life
outcomes since most talented people can no longer focus for extended
periods, while status signals are becoming diluted through Stanford
dropouts and two-week tech employees claiming "ex-" status, creating
an environment where incubators outnumber credible founders and people
build social media distribution as a hedge against an uncertain
AI-driven future.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE JACKPOT AGE (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The "Jackpot Age" describes a dangerous cultural shift where people
increasingly chase rare, massive wins despite negative long-term odds.
This mindset, exemplified by SBF and Three Arrows Capital's linear
wealth preferences that led to $10 billion losses each, has spread
from venture capital to everyday culture through online gambling, 0DTE
options, and memecoins as wage stagnation and AI-driven
winner-take-all dynamics push people toward negative-sum jackpot
hunting. The result is a system that maximizes aggregate growth while
farming human potential, creating widening inequality and social
unrest. Society needs new meaning systems beyond jackpot worship to
offer dignity and purpose without self-destructive risk-taking. 

 FROM STABLECOINS TO TOKENIZED U.S STOCKS (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The "Dollar Doom Loop" – where Fed rate hikes strengthen the
dollar, weaken emerging market currencies, and trigger capital flight
– has driven massive stablecoin adoption in countries like Bolivia,
Turkey, and Nigeria as residents seek dollar-denominated protection
from local currency collapse. Tokenized US equities represent the next
evolution, addressing stablecoins' limitation of zero returns by
offering emerging market users access to dollar-linked,
yield-generating assets through crypto rails, bypassing traditional
brokerage barriers. Early adoption signals are evident in XStocks'
$37.8 million trading volume and 1,500% address growth, with
significant activity during Asia and Latin American hours, though
risks remain around synthetic structures, trading hour mismatches, and
potential volatility from increased retail participation.
