MARKETS & BUSINESS

 US LAWMAKERS INTRODUCE DIGITAL ASSET REGULATORY FRAMEWORK (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The “Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025,” introduced by
Representative French Hill with bipartisan support, establishes a
clear regulatory framework by delineating SEC and CFTC oversight roles
for various digital assets. The bill mandates accurate disclosures of
project operations, ownership, and structure, and imposes stringent
compliance standards on brokers and dealers. It also creates
comprehensive registration regimes to legally authorize digital asset
firms to serve U.S. customers. 

 10-DAY US BITCOIN ETF INFLOW STREAK WITH $4.26 BILLION INFLOW (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs extended their inflow streak to ten days
through May 28, attracting a net $4.26 billion. It is driven
overwhelmingly by BlackRock's IBIT, which brought in $481 million
and accounted for 96% of the total. IBIT has now gone 33 consecutive
days without outflows and its AUM has climbed to $72 billion,
cementing its dominance since the category's January 2024 debut.
Trading volumes remain elevated, with $3.4 billion in ETF trades on
May 28 as Bitcoin consolidates near $108,500. Spot Ethereum ETFs are
on their eighth straight day of inflows, adding $84.9 million on
Wednesday and bringing cumulative flows to $2.9 billion.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 EIGENLAYER ENABLES SLASHED FUND REDISTRIBUTION TO AVSS (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 EigenLayer will soon allow slashed funds to be redirected to Actively
Validated Services (AVSs) rather than burned, enabling stakers to
underwrite not just operator risk but new financial risks with
potentially higher rewards. This shift introduces broader financial
applications beyond EigenLayer's original vision, creating a new
frontier where stakers must carefully assess risk-reward profiles. 

 INTRODUCING EULERSWAP (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 EulerSwap is a new decentralized exchange combining Uniswap v4's hook
architecture with Euler's lending infrastructure, enabling LPs to
simultaneously earn swap fees, lending yield, and use LP positions as
collateral. With features like just-in-time liquidity, custom AMM
curves, and isolated LP pools, EulerSwap targets DAOs, token issuers,
and sophisticated market makers seeking greater control, capital
efficiency, and hedging options across DeFi.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MICHAEL SAYLOR'S STRATEGY EXPLAINED (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 MicroStrategy and similar firms are issuing convertible debt or
equity-like instruments to borrow funds and deploy the proceeds into
Bitcoin, offering investors a familiar, regulated way to gain exposure
without self-custody. Investors prefer these instruments over direct
Bitcoin purchases due to ease of access, regulatory allowances, and
reduced technical risk. If Bitcoin's price declines, companies face
haircuts, renegotiations, or bankruptcy – leaving investors holding
Bitcoin – and there's a risk that issuers may misrepresent their
actual holdings. 

 BEST STABLECOIN YIELDS ISSUE #9 (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The top 10 stablecoin yield strategies range from MEV-driven vaults
(12.6% APY) and Pendle LP positions (up to 24% APY) to leveraged
borrowing on Morpho (20% net APR) and fxSAVE's wrapped stability pool
(13% APY with up to ~33% APR at 5× leverage). Other highlights
include protocol-specific opportunities, like Basis's sUSDe (6.8%
weekly) and wstUSR (10% weekly), Reservoir's srUSD pools (15–25% APR
plus multiplier points), and Liquity's stability pool enhanced by
airdrops from friendly forks. Complex yield architectures emerge
through composable, on-chain incentives like Euler's high-liquidity
campaigns, Reservoir x Beraborrow LP looping (up to ~147% APR), and
Falcon's fixed 11.12% for 119 days. EtherFi's collateral-backed card
solution (~21% APR plus cashback) is a compelling option for users
looking to spend their crypto.

 COINBASE SIGNS SF LEASE FOUR YEARS AFTER PAYING $25M TO LEAVE (7
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Coinbase will lease 150,000 square feet in San Francisco's Mission
Rock, marking its largest office since paying a $25 million fee to
exit its previous HQ and embracing a remote-first model. After a
two-year site search, the company will occupy more than half of the
newly built Building B developed by Tishman Speyer and the Giants.
Coinbase offers remote flexibility to most of its roughly 3,800
employees and carries $132.3 million in global office liabilities. The
deal emphasizes Coinbase's optionality and “decentralized” ethos. 

 DISTRIBUTED PROTOCOLS WITH SMART CASUAL VERIFICATION (18 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Smart casual verification blends the strengths of formal math-based
checks with everyday software testing to catch bugs in complex
distributed systems. For the Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF),
the Decentralized Thoughts team first wrote a concise “model” of
their custom consensus process using TLA+, a tool that can
automatically look for logic errors. By exhaustively and randomly
exploring a finite-state TLA+ model of their Raft-derived algorithm,
they uncovered six subtle bugs before deployment. This approach of
combining model checking with practical trace validation delivers
strong confidence in the protocol's correctness without requiring
formal proving.
