MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TETHER HITS $160B MARKET CAP, EYES INTERNET'S FINANCIAL RAILS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Tether's USDT has hit a record $160 billion market cap driven by
increased adoption in developing countries and high profits from U.S.
Treasury holdings, which now exceed $127 billion. CEO Paolo Ardoino
called the milestone a testament to USDT's role as the “digital
dollar,” especially on Tron, where ~$81 billion of the stablecoin
circulates because of its lower fees and faster transactions. While
analysts predict Circle's USDC will gain regulatory advantages under
the GENIUS Act, Tether is expected to maintain dominance with 65%
market share, supported by aggressive expansion into AI, telecom, and
Bitcoin mining. Ardoino claims it will be the world's largest operator
by 2025. 

 BITCOIN CONSOLIDATES BELOW RECORD HIGH (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin is trading at approximately $118,000, about 5% below its
all-time high. Onchain data reveals unified accumulation across all
wallet cohorts, from retail shrimps (<1 BTC) to institutional whales
(>10,000 BTC), all registering Accumulation Trend Scores of 1,
indicating aggressive buying pressure last seen in November 2024 and
May 2025. Small to medium-sized holders alone are accumulating 19,300
BTC per month, significantly outpacing the 13,400 BTC monthly issuance
rate and absorbing over 100% of new supply. This widespread
accumulation pattern across every wallet size creates a supply squeeze
effect, as retail and mid-sized investors alone are removing more
Bitcoin from circulation than miners are producing.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING GAUNTLET REWARDS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gauntlet has launched live USDC incentives on its USD Alpha vault
(gtUSDa), which has grown to $5.7 million and currently yields 11.96%
APY, with rewards streamed non-custodially via Sablier and claimable
any time. The firm's USDC-denominated vaults now total $355 million
– 3.4% of onchain USDC yield opportunities and 0.6% of circulating
supply. Designed for institutional use cases like wallet earn
programs, fund treasury optimization, and stablecoin merchant
settlement, these incentives aim to balance attracting supply without
fostering mercenary flows. Gauntlet plans to expand its strategy set
in the coming weeks to capture a broader array of onchain yield
opportunities. 

 PALANTÍRI - A PREDICTION MARKET REDESIGN (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Palantíri introduces a dynamic AMM that blends LMSR's bounded-loss
pricing with adaptive liquidity inspired by PM-AMM using a
time-varying function b(t) that grows with trading volume and gently
decays as events near resolution. It incorporates a certainty throttle
to protect LPs when probabilities approach 0 or 1, alongside fee
mechanics and slippage guards to ensure fair compensation and stable
pricing. By treating b(t) like a “smart thermostat,” the market
deepens as interest rises and cools off before close, offering both
scalability and risk control. Ongoing work will explore LP withdrawal
methods, auto-compounding strategies, dispute resolution layers,
customized time-decay profiles, and stress-testing with realistic
trader behaviors.

 UNDERSTANDING MARKET STRUCTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Uptrends are defined by higher highs and higher lows, best supported
with exponential moving averages (EMAs),volume-weighted average
pricing (VWAPs), and crossovers on higher timeframes for confirmation.
Ranging markets dominate 80% of the time, so traders should avoid
overtrading, mark key support/resistance, and watch for low volatility
with volume to anticipate breakouts. Downtrends follow lower highs and
lower lows, with ideal entries near high-probability zones like prior
points of control (POCs). Regardless of structure, most profits come
from catching the bulk of a move, not the bottom, and waiting is often
the best trade. 

 ETHEREUM'S FUSAKA UPGRADE EXPLAINED (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Fusaka will ramp Ethereum's data availability capacity to 48 blobs
per block via PeerDAS and BPO hardforks, building on EIP-4844's blob
transactions and Pectra's doubled blob target. Base engineers teamed
up with OP Labs, Test in Prod, and Soneium to unblock PeerDAS,
optimize client implementations, and validate scaling through devnet
tests. Their work, spanning spec authorship, performance improvements,
and expanded test coverage, accelerates higher-throughput rollups by
enabling beacon nodes to sample blob data rather than ingest it all.
This L2–L1 collaboration invites more developers to join working
groups and contribute to Fusaka and future Ethereum upgrades.

 WHY STABLECOINS STILL CONFUSE SMART PEOPLE (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Stablecoins are blockchain‐based tokens pegged 1:1 to fiat that
unlock instant, low‐cost, borderless payments, which is
transformative for users in unstable economies or cross-border workers
but less obvious to U.S. wage earners. Their value is often obscured
by a lingering “regulatory loophole” stigma, even as they bolster
US soft power abroad and serve as the rails of an “informal economy
2.0.” Institutions eye them for 24/7 settlement and cost savings,
yet face a minefield of compliance, accounting, fraud detection, and
tax challenges that require mature infrastructure. More than a crypto
novelty, stablecoins embody both grassroots financial innovation and
the top-down evolution of money, policy, and power. 

 THE STORY BEHIND 'DEFI WILL WIN' (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 “DeFi will win” was intentionally crafted as a three-word slogan
to cut through jargon and create an instantly memorable rallying cry.
Unlike traditional finance, which has mastered propaganda, DeFi
projects too often neglect storytelling and must adopt concise,
human-centered messaging to drive adoption. Drawing parallels to
iconic campaigns like “Just Do It,” this slogan highlights how
simple, rhythmic phrases tap into mass psychology and build movements.
Winning the future of finance depends on the systematic application of
communication principles, not just superior technology.
