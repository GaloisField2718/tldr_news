MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FRANCE TO BAN POLYMARKET (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 France's gambling regulator, the ANJ, plans to block Polymarket, a
U.S.-based crypto prediction market popular for its election betting,
due to its classification as illegal gambling under French law. Access
through VPNs and other workarounds could make enforcement challenging.


 REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTION THROUGH A CRYPTO LENS (4 MINUTE READ) [5]


 The recent U.S. election was a significant victory for crypto
advocates. A surge in pro-crypto political support was shown during
the election by hundreds of industry-friendly candidates. Crypto has
bipartisan backing. Future regulatory policy will allow the industry
to thrive domestically and internationally, starting a broader shift
toward economic freedom and a less interventionist government
approach.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 CRYPTO.COM RELEASES 2025 ROADMAP (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Crypto.com has released its roadmap for 2025. It plans to launch a
stock and options trading platform, a stablecoin, and an ETF. It is
also exploring the banking sector with personal multi-currency
accounts and interest on cash balances. Notable milestones include
“1 second, 1 cent” transfers, a US credit card, and fiat on and
off ramps in South Korea and Hong Kong. 

 THE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS OF THE SUPERCHAIN AND OPTIMISM'S FUTURE (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Optimism has expanded its mission from a single Ethereum Layer 2 (L2)
solution to a foundational role within the "Superchain," a network of
interconnected, Optimism-governed blockchains using the OP Stack to
facilitate Ethereum's scalability. Through shared technology,
governance, and a collaborative ecosystem that rewards impactful
open-source contributions, the Superchain aims to harness network
effects to grow Ethereum's capacity and enhance interoperability,
benefiting all participants and developers in its ecosystem.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ON SOLVER ECONOMICS: HOW VALUE FLOWS IN DEFI (25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ERC-7683 standardizes intent-based transactions, leading to a
commoditization of solver services and a redistribution of value to
the ecosystem. As solver fees have declined from 15 to 4 basis points
over the past year, value is increasingly flowing to order originators
like UniswapX and settlement networks like Across, which provide
critical infrastructure including flexible repayment systems and
intent backstopping. The standard is expected to capture 20-30% of L2
DEX volume and 25-40% of the bridging market. 

 TOKEN VALUATION IN THEORY AND PRACTICE (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There is no clear “L1 premium” in fully diluted valuations (FDV).
That being said, it does exist in market cap comparisons, with L2s
trading at FDV/revenue multiples of 100-250x versus L1s at 118-140x.
Optimism has significantly higher multiples largely due to successful
collective strategy implementation and adoption of OP Stack
technology. The data challenges common assumptions about blockspace
restriction and revenue generation, with Arbitrum showing lower L2
profit than Base despite higher fees.

 TALUS: UNLOCKING NEW FRONTIERS IN AUTONOMOUS DAPPS (10 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Talus is an L1 designed for AI agent deployment. It addresses current
issues like platform isolation, API fragmentation, and payment rail

orchestration through IBC protocol integration, permissionless
payments, and programmable security. Built on MoveVM, Talus aims to
provide the essential infrastructure for autonomous agents including
composability, interoperability, cost-effectiveness, and verifiable
computation. 

 DYDX ROLLUP SHUTDOWN: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN L2 STOPS? (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 dYdX v3 shutdown with $70 million in user funds stranded on the L2.
The platform's Escape Hatch mechanism allowed users to withdraw nearly
$30M through a three-step transaction process on the Ethereum mainnet.
This incident highlights the importance of security measures and
fallbacks for L2s. More robust solutions are needed for
general-purpose L2s.
