MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO FUNDS SEE $206M IN OUTFLOWS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Investors recently withdrew ~$206 million from crypto investment
products (e.g., ETF/ETP), likely due to expectations of persistently
high interest rates. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs had significant
withdrawals, while crypto futures in the U.S. saw even larger
outflows, contrasting with inflows in Canada and Switzerland. 

 THAILAND TO BLOCK CERTAIN CRYPTO PLATFORMS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Thailand's SEC is expected to restrict access to unapproved crypto
platforms to prevent illegal activities like money laundering. This
aligns with measures in India and the Philippines and follows
Thailand's positive regulatory steps towards cryptocurrency this year.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GPU-EVM: THE MOST PERFORMANT PARALLEL-EVM BY 100X (2 MINUTE READ) [7]


 GatlingX has released GPU-EVM, a mechanism to GPU-parallelize the EVM
that beats CPU-based EVMs by 100x. GPUs, made for simultaneous
operations, dramatically improve performance over sequential CPUs.
This high throughput brings numerous new applications, including
training reinforcement learning-based AI agents with the EVM, L2
acceleration, and DeFi simulations. 

 INTRODUCING BIP-420: FORMAL BITCOIN IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL FOR OP_CAT
(5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The OP_CAT opcode has formally received proposal number 420. BIP-420
will allow two values to be concatenated in the Bitcoin scripting
language. Though trivial in implementation, this feature greatly
increases Bitcoin's functionality by introducing covenants that enable
smart contracts, cryptographically secure bridges, zero-knowledge
proof verification, and other useful features. OP_CAT has received
much attention recently because the Taproot Wizards promoted the
opcode through its Quantum Cats Ordinals.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 A FULL BREAKDOWN OF ZKASINO'S $33M THEFT (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In a brazen $33 million rug pull, the crypto betting platform ZKasino
converted over 10,500 ETH of user funds into $ZKAS tokens at an
inflated price without consent and imposed a 15-month vesting
schedule. Despite numerous red flags, including the founder's shady
past, unpaid employees, and abruptly canceled token listings, ZKasino
managed to raise a massive war chest before ultimately shutting down
communication channels and banning users who called out the scam. 

 UNPACKING THE STACKS BITCOIN L2 NAKAMOTO UPGRADE (2 MINUTE READ) [10]


 This tweet thread discusses the Stacks 2.5 upgrade, named Nakamoto,
which introduces significant improvements to security, speed, and
Bitcoin L1-L2 interaction. It enhances the Stacks network's (Bitcoin
L2) resilience by aligning its security with Bitcoin's and improves
transaction speed, reinforcing its position as a mature Bitcoin L2
solution. The upgrade is set to unlock new potential for Bitcoin in
DeFi as it facilitates native and decentralized Bitcoin movement
across layers.

 PUNK6529 ON THE PROGRESSION OF MEMES RELATING TO FREEDOM (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The increasing centralization of power, exacerbated by AI, poses
significant risks to society. Decentralized systems like open-source
software, public blockchains, and NFTs, combined with the power of
memes and culture, can serve as an essential safety valve against
potential centralized nightmares. 

 CRYPTO WILL 10X INTERNET UX (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Crypto's path to hundreds of millions of users will come by making
the user experience drastically better than Web2. Passwordless keys,
web wallets, smart contract accounts, and open social graphs remove
many frustrations around having multiple accounts, two-factor
authentication, and siloed information. Signing into new apps will be
a one-click process, with all relevant information and finances
immediately available. Crypto will make the internet more usable and
interconnected than ever before.
