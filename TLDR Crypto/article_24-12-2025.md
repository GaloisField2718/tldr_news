MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN TO REBOUND PERFORM IN 2026, SAYS VANECK (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 VanEck's David Schassler predicts Bitcoin will be a "top performer"
in 2026 after lagging the Nasdaq 100 by roughly 50% year-to-date, with
the firm actively buying ahead of expected liquidity return and
currency debasement acceleration. Gold surged 70% this year to $4,492,
with Schassler targeting $5,000 in 2026 as funding future liabilities
increasingly relies on money printing, pushing investors toward scarce
stores of value. Bitcoin historically responds sharply when debasement
ramps and liquidity returns, with the thesis intact despite 2025's
weakness reflecting softer risk appetite and tight liquidity
conditions. 

 ‘MOST IMPORTANT TOKENHOLDER RIGHTS DEBATE': AAVE FACES IDENTITY
CRISIS (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Aave's community fractured over a proposal transferring brand control
from Aave Labs to the DAO following CoW Swap fees flowing to Labs
instead of the treasury, with the dispute centered on who controls
trademarks, domains, and social accounts for the $33 billion TVL
protocol. Labs supporters argue that company autonomy enables faster
execution and competitive shipping, as "DAOs are structurally
incapable" of product velocity, while DAO advocates led by Marc Zeller
argue token holders bearing economic risk should control branding
since independent service teams maintain the protocol. The vote
currently shows 58% against transfer, with one-third abstaining ahead
of Friday's conclusion, as other protocols watch with growing concern.
AAVE fell 18% over the week as the dispute deepened beyond typical
crypto market weakness.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BROWSERBASE ENABLES AGENTIC PAYMENTS WITH COINBASE AND X402 (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Browserbase partnered with Coinbase to enable LLMs to discover
services through x402 Bazaar and autonomously pay per browser session
via instant USDC settlement, eliminating API keys, billing setup, and
human approval for agent-driven web automation. Coinbase Business
handles settlement with automatic yield on idle balances,
institutional custody, and real-time visibility as agents spin up
browsers, navigate live websites, and extract data programmatically.
The integration unlocks workflows where agents use the web by
interacting with real pages and interfaces while paying for compute
autonomously without reconciliation work or fraud risk. 

 GHANA TO EXPLORE GOLD-BACKED STABLECOIN (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ghana passed the Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill, legalizing
crypto trading and requiring entities to register with the Bank of
Ghana or Securities and Exchange Commission, depending on activity
type, with Governor Johnson Asiama confirming "no one is going to be
arrested" for trading under the new framework. The country processed
$3 billion in crypto transactions from July 2023 to June 2024, with
17% of adults using crypto, positioning the legislation to manage
risks in an already-active market. Ghana plans targeted exploration of
asset-backed digital settlement instruments, including gold-backed
stablecoins in 2026, focused on payments, trade finance, and FX
settlement to lower costs, expand access, and strengthen compliance.

 ETHEREUM IN 2025: FROM EXPERIMENT TO WORLD INFRASTRUCTURE (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 2025 was the year Ethereum graduated into real financial
infrastructure. It experienced rapid protocol progress (e.g., Pectra
and Fusaka, higher gas limits, cheaper transactions, and more blob
capacity), plus institutional and regulatory milestones (stablecoin
framework via GENIUS Act, SEC staking guidance, JPMorgan/BlackRock
tokenization momentum). Ethereum's L2 ecosystem, DeFi, and privacy
tooling have matured materially. AI-agent commerce rails (e.g.,
standards + micropayments) are also beginning to land on Ethereum. 

 WHY THE DEFI LENDING MOAT IS BIGGER THAN YOU THINK (8 MINUTES READ)
[9] 

 A common narrative is that vaults and curators own distribution, so
they'll capture the economics. However, lending protocols (e.g., Aave
and Spark) often earn more than the vaults built on top of them
because they skim a reserve factor on interest paid on borrowed
notional, while vault fees are usually charged on TVL. Aave and Spark
capture multiples of vault revenue per unit of TVL and, in aggregate,
even rival or beat upstream issuer economics (e.g., staked ETH
issuers) in today's market structure.

 YIELDMAGGEDON: WHY LAZY YIELD IS DEAD; OPTIONS ARE THE NEW FRONTIER
(9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The post argues that the easy, mostly delta-neutral 20-30% crypto
yield era is largely over as the biggest historical yield sources
(e.g., airdrops/points, perp incentives, basis trades, etc.) compress.
With baseline yields (e.g., sUSDe) down sharply versus 2024, many
yield products will either die or take hidden risks. The next frontier
is onchain options selling (covered calls, call spreads, cash-secured
puts) as a scalable way to earn yield by explicitly warehousing
volatility rather than hunting temporary loopholes. 

 TAO & WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE EARLY (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Bittensor (TAO) is in the quiet infrastructure-building phase that
preceded massive outcomes in Amazon, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Netflix,
Tesla, and the market is mispricing it because it's complex, early,
and noisy. Subnets are shipping quickly, there are early signs of real
demand (a few subnets claiming paying customers and high performance),
and improving market access (e.g., trust and ETP products).
