 FOLDABLE HOMES = MASS PRODUCTION: INVEST IN THE COMPANY ELON MUSK
CALLED “A COOL PRODUCT” (SPONSOR) [4] 

 High-quality affordable housing has never been in higher demand - and
we're simply not building houses fast enough.

One company is approaching the problem in a completely new way: houses
that are pre-built in the factory [4], and can be installed in a day.
And it already has 600+ houses built and 3 factory buildings.

With a huge potential market and +600 homes already built, their
public investment round [4] has attracted +$150m from over 40,000
investors.

 Towns is a new app for creating encrypted, permissionless, and
decentralized group chats onchain. It uses River as its communication
primitive and Base as its blockchain. The onchain integration allows
for token-gated group chats, membership fee revenue models, and
additional custom entitlements.

 WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR DECENTRALIZED PRIVATE NEW INTERNET? (20 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 This article addresses the problems with balancing onchain
confidentiality with regulatory compliance, emphasizing how the lack
of privacy has impeded blockchain adoption for practical applications.
It proposes a decentralized compliance framework that uses selective
disclosure and threshold cryptography to provide privacy while
enabling de-anonymization when necessary. This approach could allow
for additional use cases like frontrunning protection and private
governance votes, though critics question how it would practically
operate with various government compliance requirements.

 SUI FOUNDATION DISPUTES $400 MILLION INSIDER SELLING ALLEGATION (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Sui Foundation has rejected claims that insiders sold $400M worth
of Sui tokens during the token's recent price surge, clarifying that
the aforementioned transactions involved an infrastructure partner
subject to a lockup schedule, not foundation insiders or Mysten Labs
employees. 

 THE TRUE COST OF ELECTION MARKET MANIPULATION (25 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Polymarket's presidential election odds have recently diverged from
traditional polls, with Trump surging to 52.6% despite mainstream
polls showing Harris maintaining a slight edge. It is estimated that
manipulating the market by 4% would cost around $40 million. The
potential manipulation, alongside a recent spike in trading volumes
coinciding with the odds shift, raises concerns about the integrity of
these markets. Polymarket's founder recently noted that odds differ
from polls, with 50% odds being statistically very close to 52%.
