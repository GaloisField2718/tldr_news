 VANECK FILES FOR SOLANA ETF (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 VanEck has filed for the first U.S. Solana ETF, claiming that SOL is
a commodity like BTC and ETH. This filing follows the SEC approving
spot BTC and ETH ETFs, aiming to track Solana's price through the
VanEck Solana Trust on the Cboe BZX Exchange. 

 COINBASE SUES SEC (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Coinbase is suing the SEC and FDIC, using the Freedom of Information
Act to demand the release of documents concerning past crypto
investigations and regulatory actions. It claims these agencies have
systematically hindered the crypto industry, which can be seen in the
ongoing disputes over regulation and access to banking services for
crypto firms.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE PARTNERS WITH STRIPE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stripe and Coinbase are partnering to boost global crypto adoption by
integrating USDC on Base into Stripe's payout and onramp services and
incorporating Stripe's fiat-to-crypto onramp into Coinbase Wallet for
instant crypto purchases with credit cards and Apple Pay. 

 HYPERLANE'S EIGENLAYER AVS EXPLAINED (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hyperlane allows rollups to permissionlessly connect with fast and
cheap bridging. Its AVS, powered by EigenLayer and secured by restaked
ETH, connects any rollup with any other without requiring liquidity or
validators to secure the bridging. The AVS is live on mainnet. More
details will be revealed over the next few weeks.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MAPPING THE BLOCKCHAINS DRIVING ASSET TOKENIZATION (15 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Stellar, and Base are public blockchain
tokenization leaders. RWA-specific public chains like Provenance,
Plume Network, and XDC offer features catered toward issuers and have
seen some adoption. JP Morgan's Onyx, R3's Corda, Canton Network, and
Kinto are private alternatives that restrict access to authorized
participants and are better for enterprise-grade tokenization. 

 A LOOK AT L2 MEV (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Though EIP-4844 reduced L2 fees, it has caused bot actions and
spamming. Telegram bots are paying over 20x higher gas fees, with
revert fees on top L2s spiking around 10% to 20%. There aren't many
sandwich attacks with L2 single sequencer architectures, but shared
sequencers will introduce mempools and, therefore, high MEV.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SOLANA STABLECOIN VOLUMES (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Solana's daily stablecoin volume has dropped sharply from $74B to
~$7B since June 10. This was largely influenced by two sources: MEV
Bot 7rhxnL, and Phoenix DEX, which accounted for ~$1 trillion in total
transfer volume last month. This decline aligns with the Solana
Foundation's removal of delegations for validators involved in
manipulative trading practices, impacting the operations of MEV Bot
7rhxnL, which immediately reduced its stablecoin activity. 

 REFLECTION ON THE WORMHOLE AIRDROP (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Anti-Sybil work, vested airdrops, organic user prioritization, and
separating the checker and claim are all great practices that result
in a better airdrop experience. Most people care more about their
allocation than the success of the token post-launch, while some
express frustration with having to check wallets on several chains for
the Wormhole allocation. This thread explores Wormhole's sybil
methodology in detail.
