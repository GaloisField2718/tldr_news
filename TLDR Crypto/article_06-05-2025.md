MARKETS & BUSINESS

 IRS' CRYPTO LEADS AND ACCEPTING DOGE DEALS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Two senior IRS officials specializing in crypto, Seth Wilks and Raj
Mukherjee, have resigned after just over a year. They accepted
voluntary buyouts under a federal downsizing initiative linked to the
Trump administration's DOGE program. Both previously worked in the
crypto industry and played a central role in shaping IRS policy on
digital asset taxation, including updates to the 1099-DA tax form and
the development of the now-overturned DeFi broker rule. 

 SCHUMER, WARREN URGED DEMS TO CHANGE COURSE ON STABLECOIN BILL (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, have
withdrawn support for a bipartisan stablecoin bill to negotiate
stronger concessions from Republicans, particularly around oversight
of foreign issuers like Tether. The move surprised GOP aides and
introduced new uncertainty around the bill, though both parties remain
hopeful for a revised version that addresses national security and
transparency.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 U.S. HOUSE INTRODUCES CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE BILL (33 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The Crypto Market Structure Bill delineates responsibilities between
the SEC and CFTC, introduces stricter definitions like reducing the
"affiliated person" threshold from 5% to 1% ownership, and outlines
requirements for token listings, disclosures, and consumer
protections. Unlike other countries with unified regulators, the US'
dual-agency approach has led to jurisdictional competition,
complicating crypto oversight. This legislation seeks to resolve these
ambiguities and provide a structured environment for crypto
regulation. 

 ARBITRUM'S TIMEBOOST CAPTURES $10K DAILY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Arbitrum's Timeboost auctions are generating approximately $10,000 in
daily revenue, representing 45% of the network's total. Bid spreads
have narrowed from 60% to 20%, signaling improved auction efficiency.
However, Arbitrum still captures just 0.004% of DEX volume compared to
Base's 0.013%, indicating untapped growth potential.

 AN OPEN LETTER TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ON STABLECOINS (25 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Democratic leaders are urged to support stablecoin legislation like
the GENIUS Act to appeal to younger, tech-savvy voters who distrust
traditional banks. Stablecoins function like on-chain money market
funds, offering near-zero fees, permissionless access, integration
with U.S. Treasuries, and global financial inclusion. Advocates argue
these benefits align with core Democratic values around consumer
protection, antitrust, and equity. 

 PENDLE'S 2025 ROADMAP (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Pendle has evolved from a niche yield product into a foundational
layer in DeFi. It supports $4.4 billion in TVL and powers over
one-third of DeFi's yield category. Pendle's upcoming product, Boros,
will tokenize perp market funding rates and expand into Islamic
finance. Institutional demand and new verticals position $PENDLE as a
strong contender against peers like Aave and Uniswap.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CRYPTO MUSIC IS A JOKE (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto music projects often fail because they focus on problems like
NFTs and fan tokens instead of addressing the industry's real needs,
such as boosting ticket, merch, and sponsorship revenue, reducing
payout friction, and modernizing publishing. Without support from key
stakeholders like labels, venues, and rights organizations,
"artist-first" tools remain unused. KYD aims to engage directly with
these gatekeepers to drive adoption. 

 SEC COMMISSIONER: TOKENIZATION CAN TRANSFORM FINANCIAL MARKETS (1
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Tokenization could significantly reshape financial markets, as the
agency prepares for a May 12 roundtable featuring major financial
players and DeFi experts. The event marks a key step in the SEC's
broader push toward a clearer, more crypto-friendly regulatory
framework under its new Crypto Task Force.

 KAMINO CO-FOUNDER WARNS AGAINST RISKY CREDIT PRACTICES ON SOLANA (1

 Building resilient credit infrastructure on Solana should not be

Tron remains relatively stable.
