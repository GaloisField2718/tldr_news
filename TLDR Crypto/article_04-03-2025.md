MARKETS & BUSINESS

 STANDARD CHARTERED SAYS TRUMP CRYPTO RESERVE PLAN PUTS BITCOIN
$500,000 TARGET BACK IN FOCUS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Trump's plan to establish a Crypto Strategic Reserve including
Bitcoin and other assets could improve long-term stability and refocus
investor attention on a $500K Bitcoin target. This initiative may
prompt U.S. states to create their own Bitcoin reserves, reducing
downside risk and paving the way for sustained market growth. 

 MAJOR U-TURN IN CRYPTO MARKETS SENDS BITCOIN BACK BELOW $87K (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 President Trump's Sunday announcement of a US crypto reserve
initially boosted prices, but by Monday, Bitcoin fell to $86,700,
nearly erasing all gains, while ETH dropped below its pre-announcement
level and the ETH/BTC ratio hit a five-year low of 0.025. The stock
market declined ahead of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China,
amplifying uncertainty across risk assets and suggesting a cautious
near-term outlook for crypto.

 AAVE DEPLOYS LENDING MARKETS ON SONIC IN ITS FIRST LAYER 1 EXPANSION
OF THE YEAR (2 MINUTE READ) [7]

 ETHDENVER AI TAKEAWAYS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Traditional AI engineering talent is increasingly flowing into crypto
infrastructure teams, specifically with Nous Research and Prime
Intellect pioneering decentralized training. Agent platforms are
evolving beyond simple token launches toward comprehensive “App
Store for agents” models where AI can access various tools and
cross-chain capabilities. The market shows strong demand for “alpha
agents” offering investment advice without the noise of Crypto
Twitter. There has been an excessive focus on DeFi + AI applications,
limited differentiation, prioritization of tokenomics over product
development, and a noticeable innovation gap between web3 and web2 AI
ventures. 

 AI AS THE ENGINE, HUMANS AS THE STEERING WHEEL (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vitalik Buterin has proposed a governance mechanism where AI serves
as the computational engine while humans provide high-quality
directional input as the “steering wheel.” Rather than enshrining
a single AI model in governance systems (which lacks credible
neutrality), Buterin advocates for creating open markets where
multiple AI systems compete with simple, unchanging rule frameworks.
In this post, he explores several implementation approaches, including
Futarchy (AI traders predict outcomes while humans vote on metrics),
Distilled Human Judgement (human juries evaluate small samples while
AIs extrapolate to millions of similar cases, and Deep Funding (using
these principles to attribute value across contribution networks).
This framework maintains human control over organizational direction
while preventing voter overwhelm.

 PARADIGM'S APPROACH TO POLICY (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Paradigm has released its Policy Anchors, a set of guiding principles
aimed at promoting crypto as neutral, egalitarian technology and
shaping pro-crypto policy in Washington, DC, and globally. The
initiative includes the addition of six bipartisan members to its
Policy Council and emphasizes Paradigm's commitment to advocating for
crypto's future, ensuring regulations foster competition and avoid
favoring incumbents, while seeking community feedback to refine its
approach. 

 CRITIQUE OF TRUMP'S STRATEGIC RESERVE (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This critique by prominent investor Jason Calacanis expresses
frustration with the strategic reserve's choices, timing, and
political implications. Trump should not be spending taxpayer money
buying arbitrary cryptocurrencies, and should at the very least have a
transparent reasoning process. He believes that crypto will be the
issue that derails [Trump's] second term.
