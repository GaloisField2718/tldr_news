 MASTERCARD POISED TO ACQUIRE ZEROHASH FOR ~$2 BILLION (6 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Mastercard is in late-stage talks to acquire crypto infrastructure
startup Zerohash for $1.5-2 billion, following the company's $104
million funding round in September at a $1 billion valuation. The
potential acquisition comes after Mastercard lost a bidding war for
stablecoin startup BVNK to Coinbase, which entered exclusivity for a
deal reportedly worth around $2 billion. Zerohash, founded in 2017,
provides broader infrastructure than stablecoin-focused competitors
like Bridge and BVNK, offering APIs for crypto trading platforms and
tokenization alongside stablecoin payment rails. 

 HONG KONG REGULATOR WARNS OF RISKS IN DIGITAL ASSET TREASURIES (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has raised
concerns over Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) trading at inflated
premiums and warned investors about related risks. The regulator is
monitoring DAT operations and may introduce guidelines to ensure
investor protection, citing cases in the US where DAT stocks traded
far above the value of their crypto holdings. The Hong Kong Stock
Exchange has already rejected several DAT proposals, maintaining
restrictions against firms holding large liquid crypto reserves as DAT
momentum builds globally.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 X402 STARTER KIT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The x402 starter kit allows developers to build paid APIs requiring
USDC micropayments before processing requests, with three core
components: an Express server, the Merchant Executor for payment
verification/settlement, and a service demonstrating OpenAI/EigenAI
integration. The kit supports both facilitator-based settlement and
local direct settlement modes across multiple networks, including
Base, Polygon, Avalanche, and Solana, with payment verification using
EIP-3009 authorization signatures. Developers can deploy custom
frontends and can configure AI providers (OpenAI or EigenAI), network
parameters, and settlement modes through environment variables, with
the full payment flow handling 402 responses, signature verification,
blockchain settlement, and service execution. 

 SCALING BASE: DOUBLING CAPACITY IN 30 DAYS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Base plans to double its gas limit from 75 to 150 Mgas/s by the end
of Q4 2025 and reach 400-500 Mgas/s by early 2026 by migrating
infrastructure to Reth and addressing four scaling bottlenecks that
previously constrained growth. The Pectra hardfork doubled Ethereum
blob space in May, with PeerDAS (Fusaka fork) launching December 3,
followed by Blob Parameter Only forks increasing blob targets from 6
to 14 by January 2026, while TrieDB database restructuring promises
8-10x execution performance improvements for storage operations. Base
successfully handled 1,500 transactions per second in June with median
fees under 5 cents, targeting sub-cent, sub-second transactions for
billions of users while achieving 99.9% of blocks built in under 2
seconds.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW A2A, AP2, AND X402 ENABLE AGENTIC COMMERCE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A2A, AP2, and x402 form the communication and transaction stack that
lets AI agents autonomously interact, agree, and pay one another. A2A
defines the base grammar for agent communication, AP2 extends it for
auditability with cart mandates detailing price and terms, and x402
(by Coinbase) executes verified onchain payments. In a working
example, Bankless's agent hired an AI debate judge, sending a request
via A2A, receiving a price quote via AP2, attesting and paying through
x402, and receiving the debate output stored on EigenDA. Together,
these protocols define how agents talk, agree, and pay, forming the
foundation for autonomous agentic commerce. 

 THE “STABLECOIN TAX” AND THE CREDIBLE NEUTRALITY DEBATE (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Major chains like Solana, BSC, and Arbitrum are leaking over $1.1B
annually in stablecoin yield to issuers like Circle and Tether (40%
more than their combined fee revenue). On Solana alone, roughly $15B
in stablecoins (two-thirds in USDC) generates about $500M yearly for
Circle, part of which goes to Coinbase via its revenue-sharing deal,
funding Base, Solana's direct competitor. Developers would like to
launch an aligned, native stablecoin and redirect yield toward SOL
buybacks or burns. However, others warn that if L1s compromise
credible neutrality to capture yield, they risk turning from property
rights systems into fintech companies, sacrificing the trust that
gives blockchains long-term legitimacy.

 THE BROKEN INCENTIVES BEHIND DEFI VAULTS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most DeFi yield vaults are structurally flawed, prioritizing opaque
incentives and TVL growth over user safety or transparency. Many
vaults obscure wallet activity, misreport APYs, and recycle deposits
to inflate their own metrics, turning “DeFi” into centralized
yield farming. Whitelisted vaults with predefined, verifiable yield
sources enforced by smart contracts (like STEX AMM), and competitive
vaults where strategists must post insurance capital and compete for
deposits, bearing losses if risks backfire (as seen in Cap Money
Strategist), are both safer options. In both models, incentives are
realigned toward defined, transparent risk exposure, rather than the
current standard, where users unknowingly shoulder all the risk. 

 ETHEREUM'S FUTURE TECH STACK IS WHAT INSTITUTIONS ARE BUILDING ON (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Dismissing Ethereum for high gas fees is like rejecting the internet
in the dial-up era, as banks are adopting today's Ethereum stack with
tomorrow's upgrades. Institutional builders aren't choosing 2015
Ethereum but the 2026+ ecosystem: Fusaka scaling to 12k+ TPS, zk-L2s
like Lighter nearing Stage 2 decentralization, and ERC-7683
introducing seamless interoperability. With MegaETH targeting 100k+
TPS and zk tech soon pushing Ethereum's L1 beyond 10k TPS, the
network's secure base layer and scalable rollup stack make it the most
institution-ready platform for the onchain economy.
