INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PRIMITIVES PROTOCOL (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Primitives Protocol is a system designed to build consumer crypto
apps on Solana. The creators exploited Solana's potential for
seamless, inexpensive transactions to establish a consumer experience
akin to setting up a social media profile. Their system aims to push
mainstream adoption of crypto by simplifying the usually complex
process. They have started working on a software development kit to
support more social applications on Solana, enhancing its
infrastructure and facilitating user-friendly minting. 

 SOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE TENSOR UNVEILS PLANS FOR TNSR TOKEN (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The newly established Tensor Foundation, which supports Solana's
Tensor NFT marketplace, has revealed plans for its TNSR governance
token. Tensor presently claims around 33.49% of the NFT market share,
battling with platforms like Magic Eden. Without mentioning a
potential TNSR airdrop, the foundation praised Solana's blockchain
benefits, such as speed and cost-efficiency. The foundation aims to
nurture a network of creators and builders devoted to the success of
NFTs.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 UNDERSTANDING SOLANA TRANSACTIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article outlines a comparison between Solana and Ethereum's
transaction mechanisms. Solana's advantages include a minimal
transaction fee and quick execution time. However, Solana's fee
mechanics are insufficient for scalability, unlike Ethereum's dynamic
transaction fees which are efficient and resourceful. Despite Solana's
continuous block building and multi-threaded scheduler, weak inclusion
guarantees and less reliable prioritization make substantial network
improvements necessary. 

 SMALL CAP HUNTING GUIDE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The guide offers tips for identifying small-cap cryptocurrency gems.
It recommends using Dexscreener for filtering based on liquidity, pair
age, and transaction volume. Etherscan can help in tracking notable
wallets in new launches. Automated notifications about potential small
caps and the use of tools that track high-profit trades on Ethereum
are also encouraged. The guide also suggests monitoring new wallet
activity as an indicator of project interest. These methods carry
inherent trading risks.

 PUBLISHER-EXCHANGES: CONSUMER APPLICATIONS AND THE ATTENTION THEORY
OF VALUE (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The world of cryptocurrency is shifting towards the ‚ÄúAttention
Theory of Value,‚Äù where the price of an asset depends largely on the
amount of attention and investment it attracts. "Publisher-Exchanges,"
apps that combine attention and value, are predicted to rise,
essentially becoming marketplaces of attention. These platforms could
expand chances for asset creation, allowing inventive interaction and
coordination. With embedded asset issuance and trading,
"Publisher-Exchanges" have the potential to revolutionize how
consumers interact with crypto. 

 THOUGHTS ON CLSK (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Despite a 30% decrease in CleanSpark's (CLSK) price amidst a 30%
increase in Bitcoin (BTC) price, CLSK remains a strong investment due
to key factors such as competent management and solid growth in hash
rate. Notably, the company's decision to reserve call options to
potentially double its productivity by year's end is highlighted as an
unrecognized advantage. BTC's trend upwards will likely produce
positive outcomes for CLSK.
