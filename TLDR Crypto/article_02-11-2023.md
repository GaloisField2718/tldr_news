(SPONSOR) [9] 

 SwissBorgâ€™s Smart Engine [9] is the fastest way to go from fiat to
crypto with the best liquidity and rates. With the integration of

launched, Phoenix, SwissBorg has become the first platform to combine
the power of Centralised (CEX), Decentralised (DEX), and Foreign
Exchange (FX) platforms, all in one easy to use interface - what

 USER OPS PER SECOND VS. TPS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The traditional measure of blockchain throughput, Transactions per
Second, is increasingly unreliable due to bundled transactions. User
Operations per Second (UOPS) captures the number of user operations
within each transaction, whether they're individual tasks or grouped
within bundles. This method may offer a more accurate comparison of
blockchain utilization across different platforms and technologies,
given the variety of architectures and data models that are now
starting to pop up across different chains. 

 INJECTIVE ECOSYSTEM RESEARCH (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Injective has been gaining steam lately. This report attempts to
break down both the good and bad in the ecosystem. Injectiveâ€™s Token
Burn 2.0 initiative is creating supply scarcity, showing a promising
tokenomic model. On the other hand, the platform currently lacks a
thriving DeFi ecosystem, causing a potential issue with user
retention. The report provides ideas about how the protocol could
capitalize on its strengths and improve some of its weaknesses.
