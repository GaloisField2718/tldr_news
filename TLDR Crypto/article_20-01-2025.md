 TRUMP PROMOTES NEW MEME COIN BEFORE TAKING OFFICE ON PRO-CRYPTO
AGENDA (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 President-elect Trump launched a memecoin, TRUMP, through an
affiliate company of the Trump Organization during his inaugural
Crypto Ball on Friday night. The project plans to issue 1 billion
tokens over three years, with Trump retaining 80% of the supply. The
launch comes as Trump prepares to take office with a pro-crypto
agenda, having selected crypto-friendly officials for key positions
and promising friendly regulations. Critics warn that the token could
create conflicts of interest by allowing direct financial influence
from token holders, though the website clarifies that it is an
expression of support rather than an investment vehicle.

 IT'S ‘JUST BEGUN'—TRUMP MEME COIN SUDDENLY CRASHES BACK AS
MELANIA COIN SHOCK HITS CRYPTO (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Only a day after Trump launched his official memecoin, his wife
Melania launched her own token, which quickly achieved a $5 billion
market cap and caused TRUMP to drop 40%. Generally, online sentiment
is negative, with critics believing that the coin demonstrates the
Trump family is chasing profits. The Solana blockchain is unable to
keep up with an all-time high in demand, with the Phantom wallet
struggling to accommodate over 8 million requests per minute.

 EXPLANATION OF THE ETHEREUM BLOB EXPANSION DISCOURSE (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Blobs are temporary data storage for Ethereum L2s. They help keep
fees low and transactions fast by reducing congestion on the Ethereum
L1. With growing usage, blob space is filling up rapidly, prompting
urgent discussions to increase blob capacity in the upcoming Pectra
upgrade to maintain scalability, lower fees, and ensure a seamless
user experience while long-term solutions like “peerDAS” are
developed. 

 WHY TO BE BULLISH ON ETHEREUM (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Joe Lubin, Consensys and Ethereum co-founder, predicts that Ethereum
will maintain dominance due to its combination of decentralization,
credible neutrality, censorship resistance, and universal
composability, while acknowledging Bitcoin and Solana's continued
strength in their respective niches. Major institutions are
increasingly comfortable building on Ethereum due to its maturity,
talent base, and roadmap, with the platform positioned to be the
primary place for DeFi as traditional businesses come onchain.

 BALAJI ON ZERO-SUM MEMECOINS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Memecoins operate as zero-sum lotteries, often leading to massive
losses for late buyers unless they evolve with real use cases. In
contrast, Bitcoin is a durable, decentralized asset with a 15-year
track record, global adoption, and intrinsic utility. It offers a
compelling distinction from the speculative memecoin frenzy. 

 ECONOMIC FREEDOM CREATES PROSPERITY FOR ALL (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes crypto adoption has reached
“escape velocity” with 7% global ownership, citing a 3x
year-over-year increase in stablecoin transaction volume to $27
trillion and growing adoption in emerging markets like Argentina,
where 5 million citizens actively use crypto. This post highlights
four policy recommendations for 2025: developing crypto-specific
regulations, establishing Bitcoin strategic reserves, supporting
Special Economic Zones for innovation, and leveraging blockchain for
government efficiency. These positions are framed within a broader
political context of increasing support for free market policies
globally, with specific examples of L2 networks enabling sub-second,
sub-cent global transactions.

QUICK LINKS

 LONG-TERM TRUMP COIN MAY BE BEARISH FOR CRYPTO (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While Trump launching a token might boost crypto short-term, it could
spark a wave of celebrity token launches and eventual mass rug pulls
during a market downturn, leading to widespread losses and making
crypto highly controversial in policy circles. 

 ARGUMENT FOR PHANTOM WALLET VALUATION (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Phantom's $3B valuation seems justified given Solana's dominance,
Phantom's majority share of Solana transaction volume, its
revenue-generating swap fees, and its strategic positioning as a
sticky wallet with significant bargaining power. 

 VITALIK TALKS TO GOALS OF RESTRUCTURING THE ETHEREUM FOUNDATION
LEADERSHIP (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Ethereum Foundation is restructuring its leadership to improve
the foundation's technical expertise, strengthen ties with ecosystem
actors, support app builders, and promote values like privacy and
censorship resistance while increasing the use of decentralized
technologies. 

 ETHEREUM'S BLOB PREDICAMENT (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Ethereum's current challenge lies in balancing the need to scale blob
capacity to keep L2 fees competitive with alt-L1s while ensuring
sufficient ETH value accrual through deflationary pressures from blob
consumption.
