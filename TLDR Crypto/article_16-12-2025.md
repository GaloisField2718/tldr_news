MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BARCLAYS SEES ‘DOWN-YEAR' FOR CRYPTO IN 2026 (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Barclays forecasts a "down-year" for crypto in 2026 as spot trading
volumes cool sharply without clear catalysts to reverse the trend,
revising Coinbase's price target down to $291, citing declining retail
activity and rising operating costs. The bank argues market enthusiasm
already priced in political tailwinds, while pending CLARITY Act
legislation could ease operational uncertainty but faces Senate
passage and legal challenges before practical impact materializes.
Tokenization efforts from BlackRock, Robinhood, and others remain
early-stage and unlikely to materially affect 2026 earnings despite
long-term potential. Barclays contrasts 2026's muted outlook with
prior bull-run catalysts like March 2024 spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and
November's pro-crypto presidential win that drove temporary volume
spikes. 

 SOUTH KOREA MISSES DEADLINE FOR STABLECOIN REGULATION (4 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 South Korea's Financial Services Commission missed the December 10
deadline for submitting won-pegged stablecoin regulation as tensions
escalate with the Bank of Korea demanding veto power over issuance
approvals and requiring bank-led consortia to hold 51%+ stakes in
issuing entities. The FSC rejected both demands, citing a lack of
global precedents and pointing to the EU and Japan, where fintech
firms dominate issuance, while all cryptocurrency and stablecoin
issuance remains illegal on South Korean territory. The ruling
Democratic Party committed to introducing legislation by the end of
January 2026, per President Lee Jae-myung's manifesto promises.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 JUMP CRYPTO'S FIREDANCER HITS SOLANA MAINNET (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Jump Crypto's Firedancer client launched on Solana mainnet after
three years of development and 100 days in production, written in C
with modular tile-based architecture, demonstrating over 1 million TPS
on commodity hardware versus the Rust-based Agave and Jito-Agave forks
that historically dominated 95%+ of validators. The new implementation
reduces single-client bug risk, threatening network liveness, as a
hybrid "Frankendancer" client already captured 26% validator market
share, signaling potential adoption trajectory. Firedancer uses
low-level hardware access for fine-tuned optimization and splits
validator tasks to run in parallel rather than monolithically,
advancing Solana toward 1 million TPS goals alongside the proposed
Alpenglow upgrade targeting 150-millisecond finality. 

 AAVE V4'S LIQUIDITY HUB MODEL CHANGES HOW DEFI BOOTSTRAPS MARKETS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Aave V4 introduces a hub-and-spoke liquidity architecture where
liquidity is pooled in shared hubs and allocated to multiple spokes
with distinct collateral and risk configurations. This allows new
markets to launch using existing liquidity, making incentives far more
capital-efficient and avoiding repeated bootstrapping from zero. Once
a network establishes its first Aave V4 hub, that liquidity becomes
reusable infrastructure for spinning up new markets, use cases, and
expansions indefinitely.

 17 THINGS A16Z CRYPTO IS EXCITED ABOUT (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 a16z crypto's 17 predictions for 2026 center on stablecoins plugging
into local payment rails and bank ledger upgrades from COBOL
mainframes, crypto-native RWA perpification over skeuomorphic
tokenization, and privacy becoming the most defensible moat, creating
chain lock-in as bridging secrets is harder than bridging tokens. The
firm expects Know Your Agent identity primitives to unlock agentic
commerce, SNARKs hitting 10,000x overhead to enable real-time GPU
proving for verifiable cloud computing, and secrets-as-a-service to
provide programmable data access controls for institutions tokenizing
real-world assets. Prediction markets will scale with AI agents as
sophisticated traders and LLM oracles resolving contested outcomes,
while crypto market structure legislation could eliminate legal
distortions, forcing builders to optimize for cover over product
strategy. Additional themes include staked media replacing claims of
neutrality with verifiable commitments, decentralized
quantum-resistant messaging eliminating private servers, and wealth
management democratization through AI-personalized portfolios
executing instantly on tokenized asset classes. 

 HOW ETHENA IS ATTACKING USDC ON HYPERLIQUID (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethena is countering Circle's ~$20M in profits from $4B+ USDC
deployed on Hyperliquid by launching HyENA, a PerpDEX built on HIP-3
where USDe becomes the core trading collateral. Unlike USDC, USDe
earns ~5% APY even while trading, routing value to users and LPs via
yield, funding rates, market making, and liquidation fees. The
strategy reframes stablecoins from extractive infrastructure to
user-aligned financial primitives, positioning HyENA as a core Ethena
product and a direct challenge to stablecoin-as-a-service models.

 ETHEREUM SCALING IS STILL FAR FROM GLOBAL-SCALE CRYPTO (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Cheap ETH swaps don't mean crypto is “done” scaling. Even
Ethereum, Base, and Solana are nowhere near the throughput required
for truly global, consumer-scale applications. A single viral app like
HQ Trivia in 2018 handled ~2.38M concurrent users, implying a demand
of ~238k TPS for a single trustless, verifiable, instant onchain
experience, far beyond what any major chain can handle today without
multi-hour settlement delays or extreme fees. 

 NON-USD STABLES AREN'T STUCK BECAUSE OF “NO DEMAND” (7 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The real blocker for non-USD stablecoins isn't user demand for
non-USD settlement, it's bank supply, constrained by post-2008
regulation that makes holding and market-making “non-reserve” FX
inventory balance-sheet expensive, operationally messy, and
capital-inefficient. As non-USD liquidity can be “trapped” by
jurisdictional frictions and is treated as less stress-monetizable,
banks rationally retreat to a USD hub-and-spoke model, leaving
emerging market or non-major corridors in a structural liquidity
vacuum. On-chain FX that depends on traditional bank market-making is
structurally doomed, and non-USD stables need DeFi-native liquidity
bootstrapping mechanisms.

 ETHEREUM IS SCALING ON MULTIPLE FRONTS (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Ethereum isn't falling behind, as L2 throughput is rapidly scaling

steadily improves toward ~250 TPS before zk-based jumps.
