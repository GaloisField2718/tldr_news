MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN BULLS LOSE STEAM, AUSSIE-YEN DIPS, HINTING AT BROAD-BASED
RISK AVERSION AHEAD (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin's momentum has stalled near $100,000 as traditional market
risk indicators flash warning signals, particularly visible in the
weakening AUD/JPY pair amid growing speculation of a December Bank of
Japan rate hike. The market setup bears striking similarities to the
July-August period when the yen strengthening triggered widespread
deleveraging, pushing Bitcoin from $70,000 to $50,000. The combination
of potential BOJ tightening, Federal Reserve policy uncertainty, and
resurging trade war concerns suggest increased downside risk of
Bitcoin in the short term. 

 BRAZILIAN LAWMAKER PROPOSES NATIONAL BITCOIN RESERVE TO HEDGE
ECONOMIC RISKS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A Brazilian lawmaker has proposed a bill to create a national bitcoin
reserve. It will allocate up to 5% of Brazil's international reserves
to hedge against economic and geopolitical risks. The bill marks
another step in the growing trend of nation-states embracing Bitcoin.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GAME - ENABLING AGENT-TO-AGENT INTERACTIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Virtuals Protocol's GAME framework enables autonomous agent
interactions and sophisticated actions. The initial demo was shown in
a Roblox game, but the architecture extends far beyond gaming
environments. GAME aims to become the open communication standard for
the Agentverse. Virtuals plans for the standard to allow for
agent-to-agent interactions, transactions, and coordination at scale
by combining working and long-term memory components with high and
low-level planners to enable complex behaviors. 

 VECTOR LAUNCH (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meme trading app VECTOR has officially launched on Apple and Google
Play, offering an exclusive, invite-only experience through access
codes. The platform is generating buzz with ongoing code drops,
fueling excitement among traders eager to participate in its unique
trading ecosystem.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 DAVID AND GOLIATH: HOW WEB3 CAN COMPETE IN AI (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Web3 protocols are positioning themselves to compete in AI by
targeting specific niches rather than challenging web2 giants head-on
in foundation model development, with a focus on providing compute
resources for mid-tier and bespoke models. The strategy leverages
Web3's strengths in censorship resistance, transparency, and social
verifiability, particularly in areas where decentralized networks
offer value. Centralized giants dominate cutting-edge hardware and
foundation models, but Web3 protocols can still provide unique value
in overlooked areas and pave the way for a more diverse and open AI
ecosystem. 

 WHY DECENTRALISED COMPUTE MATTERS (40 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The AI infrastructure landscape has grown exponentially as the race
to artificial superintelligence heats up, with major players investing
billions in specialized data centers. Though centralized training is
more efficient, decentralized compute networks are well-positioned to
serve three key market segments: training of smaller specialized
models, fine-tuning existing models, and inference workloads requiring
distribution and redundancy. Going forward, permissionless
alternatives may become essential infrastructure for ensuring open
access to AI capabilities as the technology becomes increasingly
fundamental to society.

 FLUID: THE NEXT ZERO-TO-ONE INNOVATION IN DEFI (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 By combining smart collateral, which allows users to earn lending
interest and trading fees on deposited assets, and smart debt, which
transforms borrowed assets into productive liquidity, Fluid has become
a legitimate competitor to blue-chip DeFi protocols. It is able to
achieve unprecedented capital efficiency on its DEX, generating up to
$39 in liquidity for every $1 deposited, while offering high
loan-to-value ratios of 95%. Fluid has rapidly grown to be a top-5 DEX
on Ethereum by volume with organic yields up to 51% APY without
incentives. 

 DEEP DIVING INTO BASE STABLECOIN VOLUMES (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Base's daily stablecoin transfer volume has skyrocketed to $15B,
driven largely by sophisticated market-making strategies on the
Aerodrome DEX, with some addresses generating billions in daily
transfer volume through advanced liquidity management and leverage
techniques. This activity boosts liquidity and reduces slippage for
traders, signaling growth across Base's stablecoin ecosystem and
driving broader adoption beyond isolated DEX activity. 

 EXPLAINING THE PANTERA BITCOIN FUND (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In 2013, Pantera CEO Dan Morehead launched the Bitcoin Fund based on
the belief that Bitcoin's price was poised for significant long-term
growth, acquiring 2% of the global supply. He remains similarly
optimistic today about its future returns.
