 GRAYSCALE GEARS UP FOR SPOT BITCOIN ETF, UPDATING TRUST AGREEMENT FOR
SAKE OF â€˜OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIESâ€™ (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Grayscale is updating its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, marking the first
modification of the trust since 2018, in preparation for a potential
transition to a spot bitcoin ETF. The changes include a daily fee
payment structure and the option for assets to be blended in an
account for easy share creation and redemption. Experts are suggesting
that this is yet another sign that the spot bitcoin ETF applications
from Grayscale and others will be approved. 

 ABU DHABI TOKENIZED EQUITY? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Abu Dhabi-based M2 Exchange has launched a token called MMX that
is tied to M2 Global Wealth Limited, giving rise to speculations of a
possible tokenized equity platform being approved in Abu Dhabi. There
are questions about its business structure as it has entities
regulated both in Abu Dhabi and the Bahamas. However, Abu Dhabi's new
legislation reflects a desire to make the city into a crypto hub, and
allowing for tokenized equity like this thread suggests would set the
region apart.

 SEI V2 - THE FIRST PARALLELIZED EVM BLOCKCHAIN (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sei is planning a major upgrade to the chain, intending to create the
first fully parallelized EVM. Known as Sei v2, the upgrade will allow
the Sei network to maintain its rapid block finalization and
transaction rate while adding support for EVM smart contracts. This
means developers can implement already-audited smart contracts from
EVM-compatible blockchains without changing their code. The upgrade is
expected to be released on testnet in Q1 2024.

analysis, $RLB has been the best performer, with its current market
cap sitting at $500m and an approximate 20% monthly growth rate. $BCB
and $KNK have shown less promising growth rates, with $KNK recently

 RETHINKING THE FLATCOIN PROBLEM (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article debates the necessity of a stablecoin for a robust
monetary system, challenging the common belief that market-based
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could fulfill this role. The author
suggests a simplified monetary system, maintaining price stability
with optimal interest rates, rather than attempting to create a
stablecoin pegged to purchasing power. Establishing a native unit of
account with a controlled monetary policy might be more beneficial
than launching yet another stablecoin effort. 

 ON REAL ESTATE (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This older thread goes over the concept of real estate and how it
isnâ€™t actually that different from digital ownership. Punk 6529
likens the process of buying property - acquiring title deeds and
registering at the county office - with owning an NFT, asserting that
both are symbolic of digital or physical ownership respectively and
are only a social convention. NFTs are as secure as physical property
and can be enforced with math instead of just physical force.
