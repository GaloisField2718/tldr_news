[9] 

 This research explores 31 days' worth of Ethereum validator votes to
help better understand how to penalize missed attestations dynamically
and improve network health. It found that performance varies
significantly between validators and that attestation inclusion delay
is a critical factor. Timing games caused by MEV adversely impact
attestation performance, and big blocks have fewer attestations due to
the increased data transfer time.

 THOUGHTS ON BLAST DISTRIBUTION (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The recent distribution $BLAST has lowered the "financial stakes"
compared to earlier phases. BLAST has a fully diluted valuation (FDV)
of $1.5B down from previous expectations over $8B. This means there
will be more gold supply and less BLAST, effectively decreasing
individual reward value unless BLAST appreciates significantly.
