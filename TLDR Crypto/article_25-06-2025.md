MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN DOMINANCE REBOUNDS TO 62% AS INSTITUTIONS FAVOR BLUE-CHIPS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin's market dominance has climbed back to 62%, reversing May's
dip and signaling sustained institutional preference for blue-chip
crypto exposure. While Bitcoin benefits from mainstream adoption and
equities like COIN and MSTR offer accessible entry points, altcoins
remain fragmented and underrepresented in traditional portfolios. This
divergence in capital allocation may delay the start of an altcoin
season despite broader market strength. 

 JAPAN PROPOSES RECLASSIFYING CRYPTO, PAVING WAY FOR ETFS AND LOWER
TAXES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Japan's FSA has proposed reclassifying cryptocurrencies as financial
products under the FIEA, paving the way for crypto ETFs and a flat 20%
capital gains tax. The move would shift crypto out of a progressive
tax regime that reaches up to 55%, aligning it with equities and
boosting appeal for both retail and institutional investors. With over
12 million active crypto accounts and initiatives like SMBC and Ava
Labs exploring stablecoins, Japan is positioning itself as a global
crypto hub under its “New Capitalism” strategy.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 TREEMAPS: SEE WHAT'S DRIVING ONCHAIN GROWTH (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Token Terminal has launched treemap visualizations to show protocol
metrics like active loans by chain, sector, and growth rate, using
size and color gradients to highlight leading players. A recent
example shows Morpho as Base's top lending protocol with $530.5M in
loans, up 23.7% over 30 days, making it both the largest and
fastest-growing in its sector. 

 CHAINLINK, MASTERCARD LETTING 3B CARDHOLDERS BUY CRYPTO ONCHAIN (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chainlink and Mastercard have partnered to enable over 3 billion
Mastercard holders to purchase cryptocurrencies directly onchain
through an integrated system involving Shift4 for payment processing,
zerohash for custody, and XSwap/Uniswap for decentralized token swaps.
Chainlink's interoperability protocol facilitates the data exchange
between traditional card networks and multiple blockchains, creating a
bridge between off-chain and on-chain transactions. This partnership
continues Mastercard's expansion into cryptocurrency infrastructure,
following recent collaborations with MoonPay for stablecoin payments
and Kraken for crypto debit cards.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 IRANIAN CEX HACK MOTIVATED BY MORE THAN MONEY (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto's largest Iranian exchange, Nobitex, was breached on June 18,
with attackers siphoning off between $48.65 million and $82 million
across Tron, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other chains. The hacker group
“Gonjeshke Darande” claimed responsibility and sent the funds to
vanity addresses emblazoned with anti-IRGC messages, thereby
permanently burning the assets. This deliberate destruction of value
and public political messaging recast the incident as cyber terrorism
rather than a profit-driven crime. 

 HOW TO MAKE SURE YOU GET PAID THIS CYCLE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Despite record highs in stablecoins, payments, and institutional
onchain adoption by firms like JPMorgan, BlackRock, Mastercard, and
Shopify, most token holders aren't capturing the resulting profits.
Value is accruing to application-layer companies rather than public
tokens, signaling the end of low-float, high-FDV launches and
CEX-listing arbitrage. Going forward, sustainable wealth generation in
crypto will mirror other industries: thesis-driven investing in
BTC/ETH or building revenue-driven companies rather than
“spray-and-pray” token bets.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SINGLENESS OF MONEY (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Circle has launched USDC native minting on Codex, making it the
fastest chain in crypto history to secure this milestone. The
announcement emphasizes Codex's focus on solving the “singleness of
money” problem, ensuring 1 USD stable equals 1 USD fiat across
geographies and rails by addressing deep-rooted issues at the
fiat–crypto boundary. Codex is building native solutions for T+0
wholesale FX, atomic compliance-integrated off-ramps, and risk-free
fiat delivery, positioning itself as the infrastructure backbone for
global stablecoin interoperability. 

 STABLECOINS COULD SUPERCHARGE RETAIL MARGINS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A Shopify unit economics breakdown shows stablecoin payments already
deliver higher implied gross margins (30%) than credit cards (22%)
despite a slightly lower take rate. Cross-border USDC rails eliminate
costly FX fees (up to 1.25%) and settlement delays, offering faster
and cheaper merchant payouts. With big-box retailers like Walmart and
Costco operating on razor-thin 2–3% profit margins, even a 1–2%
reduction in payment fees could boost bottom lines by 50%+, making
merchant-issued or integrated stablecoins an obvious next step.
