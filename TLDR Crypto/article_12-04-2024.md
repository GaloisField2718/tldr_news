MARKETS & BUSINESS

 ETH ETF LOW CHANCE OF MAY APPROVAL (1 MINUTE READ) [3] 

 JPMorgan estimates that the chances of spot ether ETF approval in May
are no more than 50%. The company suggests that, based on recent
litigation outcomes and decreasing concentration in Ethereum staking,
the SEC will eventually have to approve spot ether ETFs. 

 U.S. LAWMAKERS DISCUSS STABLECOINS (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Top U.S. House lawmakers, including Financial Services Committee
Chairman Patrick McHenry and Democrat Maxine Waters, met with Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to discuss advancing stablecoin
legislation. They have considered packaging the stablecoin bill with
the Federal Aviation Administration's funding reauthorization. Despite
doubts about the stablecoin bill passing this year, McHenry, who is
retiring, is prioritizing the bill to regulate stablecoin issuers and
stabilize cryptocurrency trading.

 A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF EIP-3074 (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 EIP-3074 is an approved upgrade to Ethereum that will allow
externally owned accounts to act like smart contract wallets without
deploying a contract. This enables single transaction approvals, batch
transactions, wallet asset recovery, sponsored transactions, and more.

READ) [6]

with the Chainlink Foundation. It is designed to securely transfer
tokens across multiple blockchains, addressing the industry's need for
better security in the wake of $2.83 billion lost to bridge hacks.

and a visual tracker.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 A DISCUSSION ON UNISWAP'S LEGALITY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Uniswap Labs is being sued by the SEC. The Uniswap Protocol is a
credibly neutral infrastructure. It acts like an electric grid that
can be built upon by other companies and applications to utilize the
benefits of trustless liquidity. The company has no control over what
is listed or who builds on the protocol â€” it is merely a software
publisher operating a front end. 

 WILL L4S/L5S COME NEXT? WHERE DOES THIS END? (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Though onboarding and transaction costs decrease by 99% for L3s
compared to L2s, the reduction in higher layers is not nearly as
significant. L4s and up improve scalability but ultimately settle to
Ethereum and do not come with additional cost reduction. There may be
L4s that emerge on the most successful L3s, but primarily for
ecosystem reasons and not technical or financial benefits.

 DEFI ON TRIAL (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DeFi is being tested in legal battles. Avi Eisenberg leveraged Mango
Markets' code to extract $110 million, arguing that because the code
permitted it, he didn't commit a crime. At the same time, the SEC's
case against Uniswap Labs could determine how decentralized DeFi can
be and whether the vision of a fully autonomous, code-based financial
system is realizable.
