 BITCOIN HEADING TO WORST ONE-DAY DRAWDOWN SINCE FTX (5 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Bitcoin tumbled more than 10% over 24 hours to $63,000 during early
afternoon US trading Thursday, marking its steepest one-day drawdown
since the FTX collapse on November 8, 2022 (14.3% drop) and dropping
the largest cryptocurrency 50% below its record high above $126,000
hit in early October to its weakest level since October 2024. The
selloff extended across asset classes with silver plunging 14% (now
nearly 40% below its record from a week ago), gold falling over 2%,
software stocks declining more than 3%, and crypto equities all
tumbling over 10% alongside major crypto miners. Analysts attributed
the severity to "very thin liquidity" where modest sell pressure
triggers cascading liquidations in a fragile market environment with
few orders to cushion trades, warning there is "still no signal that
we bottomed out" and pointing to the 200-day moving average around
$58,000 to $60,000 as the next key support level that aligns with
bitcoin's average cost basis among all holders. 

 EU TOKENIZATION COMPANIES PUSH FOR DLT PILOT (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A coalition of European tokenization companies has urged EU
policymakers to swiftly amend the bloc's DLT Pilot Regime, warning
that current asset limits, volume caps, and six-year license
restrictions are preventing regulated onchain markets from scaling
while the United States advances toward industrial-scale tokenization
and near-instant settlement. The companies proposed a narrow technical
fix that would expand eligible assets, raise issuance caps, and remove
pilot license time limits while maintaining investor protections,
cautioning that the EU's broader Market Integration and Supervision
Package won't take effect until at least 2030. The urgent call
contrasts sharply with recent US regulatory momentum.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PAYY: PRIVATE-BY-DEFAULT EVM L2 (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Payy Network is Ethereum's first privacy-enabled EVM L2, where ERC-20
transfers are private by default without requiring smart contract
modifications or specialized wallets. The architecture uses a
chain-native privacy pool for direct transfers and offchain "Privacy
Vaults" that allow developers to configure privacy levels via RPC
parameters, creating a spectrum from fully private to fully
compliant/public. The network targets both crypto natives seeking
frictionless private transfers and TradFi institutions wanting to
bring flows onchain without front-running or MEV risks. 

 PANDORA PREDICTION MARKETS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Pandora, a decentralized prediction market platform that utilizes AI
agents as resolution oracles, is deploying on Ethereum because of its
proven anti-fragility, million-plus validator set providing the
deepest security budget in smart contracts, and consistent upgrade
execution as critical factors for infrastructure requiring credible
neutrality and long-term reliability.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STABLECOIN MONETISATION MODELS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stablecoin profitability relies on issuance, flow, and payment
acceptance. While issuance dominates today via interest on reserves,
it remains cyclical and commoditized. Payment acceptance offers a
sustainable alternative by leveraging interchange fees and organic
liquidity, positioning future winners as payment platforms rather than
simple issuers. 

 THE AGENTIC ECOSYSTEM ON BASE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Base is emerging as the dominant blockchain for AI agent activity due
to transaction costs low enough to support micropayments via x402 and
purpose-built infrastructure. The ecosystem has processed over 9M x402
transactions with $1M+ volume in 30 days, ~1.6M OpenClaw agents
registered, and $100M+ volume on platforms like Bankr and Clanker.
This represents one of the first demonstrable product-market fits for
L2s beyond DeFi.

 CRYPTO WINTER STARTED IN JANUARY 2025 (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Crypto entered a full winter in January 2025, with BTC down 39% and
ETH down 53% from ATH, though institutional flows disguised the
severity. ETF and DAT purchases totaling ~$75B propped up BTC/ETH/XRP
(down 10-20%), while unsupported assets like ADA, AVAX, SUI, and DOT
collapsed 62-75%. Retail crypto has been in a brutal winter that
institutional capital merely papered over. 

 PEOPLE ARE GETTING PAID IN STABLECOINS. IT'S TIME TO LET THEM PAY (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stablecoin payroll is scaling fast. Companies and payroll platforms
are depositing real wages into wallets (embedded or self-custodial),
creating recurring on-chain distribution that will only matter if
people can actually spend those balances at checkout. WalletConnect
Pay is presented as the missing acceptance layer. It's a PSP-grade
integration that lets merchants and wallets use stablecoins like any
other payment method so payroll-driven stablecoin volume can convert
into everyday retail payments.

 MARKET CORRECTION: WINNERS ARE THE CASH-FLOW PLAYS (1 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Only 7 of 51 tokens finished green this week. 

 FAT APPS, NOT FAT PROTOCOLS (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The value from stablecoins, L1s, and RWA tokenization isn't accruing
to incumbent infrastructure because new entrants want to own the full
stack, so investors should stop buying base layers and instead back
application-layer winners. 

 LIQUIDITY CONCENTRATES WHERE CAPITAL IS ACTUALLY USED (1 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 A comparison of TVL versus borrowed capital shows real demand
clustering around a handful of money markets. 

 BRANDED DOLLARS NEED TO BE INTEROPERABLE (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The wave of branded stablecoins from banks and retailers only matters
