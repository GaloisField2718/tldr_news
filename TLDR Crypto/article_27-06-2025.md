MARKETS & BUSINESS

 DINARI BECOMES FIRST TO WIN U.S. APPROVAL FOR TOKENIZED STOCKS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Dinari has become the first platform approved to offer tokenized
stocks in the U.S., unlocking access to blockchain-based versions of
publicly listed equities. While Coinbase and Kraken are also pursuing
similar licenses, tokenized stocks had previously been limited to
international users. Dinari's dShares are already tradable abroad. The
firm now plans to operationalize its U.S. broker-dealer arm,
positioning itself at the forefront of onchain real-world asset (RWA)
innovation. 

 HONG KONG'S PLAN TO REGULATE CRYPTO, ENCOURAGE TOKENIZATION (7 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Hong Kong released its second major digital assets policy statement,
outlining plans for a comprehensive regulatory framework overseen by
the Securities and Futures Commission that will cover custodians,
digital asset service providers, exchanges, and stablecoins, with
public consultations on licensing regimes beginning soon. The
government will review laws on real-world asset tokenization and
financial instruments, specifically planning to regularize the
issuance of tokenized government bonds and clarify stamp duty
treatment for tokenized ETFs to enhance liquidity and accessibility.
This initiative builds on Hong Kong's recent crypto-friendly moves,
including licensing four exchanges in December and passing stablecoin
issuer legislation, as the region positions itself as a global digital
asset hub amid 380% growth in RWA tokenization to $24 billion over
three years.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GAUNTLET USD ALPHA: THE BEST RISK-ADJUSTED YIELDS (20 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Gauntlet has launched USD Alpha (gtUSDa), an institutional-grade
stablecoin yield vault on Base that automatically rebalances across
Morpho vaults on multiple chains, addressing the fragmentation in
DeFi's $20 billion stablecoin yield market across 240+ opportunities.
The strategy employs sophisticated risk management including liquidity
monitoring, a 40% cap on risk-on stablecoin exposure, and real-time
position adjustments, with backtests showing 11.02% annualized returns
versus a 6.75% benchmark from vaults.fyi. Targeting both institutional
allocators and retail users through the Gauntlet App, the vault aims
to solve the manual rebalancing and risk management challenges that
prevent efficient capital allocation across DeFi's expanding yield
landscape. 

 KRAKEN LAUNCHES KRAK TO RIVAL VENMO AND PAYPAL (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Kraken has debuted Krak, a cross-border payments app that offers free
local and global transactions in 160+ countries, aiming to rival
Venmo, PayPal, and Cash App. Users earn 4.1% on Paxos-issued USDG
stablecoin and up to 10% on staked assets, with upcoming features like
crypto-backed credit lines, Krak cards, and ENS-style “Kraktags”
for simplified payments.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 COINBASE TO LAUNCH REGULATED US PERPETUAL-STYLE FUTURES ON JULY 21 (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Coinbase Derivatives is rolling out US Perpetual-Style Futures on
July 21, offering long-dated contracts (5 years), 24/7 trading, and a
funding mechanism that mirrors global perpetuals while complying with
CFTC regulations. Launch products include nano BTC (0.01 BTC) and nano
ETH (0.10 ETH) contracts, designed for capital-efficient, spot-like
trading with leverage. This move brings the dominant global crypto
derivative format onshore, giving US traders a compliant alternative
to offshore platforms. 

 FAFO: 1 MILLION TPS ON A SINGLE EVM NODE (60 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LayerZero has introduced FAFO (Fast Ahead-of-Formation Optimization),
a blockchain transaction scheduler that achieves over 1.1 million
native ETH transfers per second and 565,000 ERC20 transfers per second
on a single node by reordering transactions before block formation to
maximize parallel execution. The system uses CPU-optimized Bloom
filters for efficient conflict detection and maintains full
Merkleization of every block while achieving 91% lower costs compared
to state-of-the-art sharded execution approaches. FAFO demonstrates
that significant blockchain throughput improvements can be achieved
through efficient CPU utilization and innovative scheduling design
without the complexity of sharding, with the open-source
implementation integrating Rust EVM (REVM) and QMDB for verifiable
state management.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AI AGENTS WILL BECOME CRYPTO BILLIONAIRES (22 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI agents are positioned to become crypto's first billionaires
because of emotionless 24/7 trading, the ability to analyze entire
blockchain histories instantly, and simultaneous execution across
thousands of transactions. The proposed path involves starting with
basic arbitrage and MEV strategies generating 5-15% monthly returns,
evolving to sophisticated DeFi strategies earning 10-30% monthly, then
creating proprietary protocols and attracting external capital, with
exponential compounding effects throughout. 

 MEV AND THE LIMITS OF SCALING (40 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MEV-driven spam has become the dominant bottleneck for blockchain
scaling, with spam bots consuming over 50% of gas on major rollups
like Base while paying less than 10% of fees, effectively neutralizing
11M gas/s of new capacity added between November 2024 and February
2025. The root cause is a market structure flaw: without visibility
into private mempools, searchers must blindly spam blocks with
speculative transactions to capture MEV, with successful arbitrages
requiring ~350 failed attempts consuming 132 million gas or 4 Ethereum
blocks. This could be solved through programmable privacy using
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that allow searchers to see
transaction flow for backrunning while preventing frontrunning,
combined with explicit bidding mechanisms to replace the current
wasteful "spam auction" with efficient price discovery.
