MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CZECH CENTRAL BANK TO CONSIDER HOLDING BITCOIN AS RESERVE ASSET (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Czech National Bank is considering allocating up to 5% of its
â‚¬140 billion reserves to Bitcoin, which would mark the first such
move by a Western central bank if implemented. Governor Ales Michl
plans to present this consideration to the bank's board today as part
of a broader reserve diversification strategy that includes gold
purchases and increased equity exposure, citing growing institutional
interest in the digital asset as contextual support. No immediate
decision is forthcoming. 

 FED HOLDS RATES STEADY AMID 'ELEVATED INFLATION,' WHILE BITCOIN
CONTINUES TO TRADE FLAT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.50%.
Bitcoin remains flat at around $100K, but analysts predict that two or
more rate cuts could push BTC past $110K and potentially up to $200K
by year's end. Bitcoin's near-term movement remains cautious despite
Trump's pro-crypto stance and institutional interest, but there are
expectations of a potential summer breakout.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PHANTOM ROLLS OUT BETA SUPPORT FOR SUI (1 MINUTE READ) [6]

and Base. It is currently a beta feature that needs to be switched on.

transfers of 300+ crypto and fiat assets globally, with automatic

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ETHEREUM PECTRA HARD FORK EXPLAINED (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethereum's upcoming Pectra hard fork, scheduled for March, aims to
improve scalability by doubling data availability blobs from an
average of three to six (max of 9 per block), though experts believe
this will only suffice until late summer. The subsequent Fusaka
upgrade is expected to implement Peer Data Availability Sampling
(PeerDAS), similar to peer-to-peer torrenting, which could further
increase efficiency and scalability. 

 WHY HAS THIS CRYPTO CYCLE BEEN SO HARD? (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This crypto cycle has been especially difficult due to factors like
PTSD from past market crashes, regulatory crackdowns, a lack of major
innovation, and a shift towards short-term trading and financial
nihilism. With BTC attracting new institutional buyers while altcoins
struggle, success now requires a more strategic approach, whether
through fundamentals-driven investments, active trading, or niche
plays like airdrop farming.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PROGRAMMABLE IP IN THE AI AGE (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Programmable intellectual property (IP), enabled by Story Protocol,
leverages smart contracts to streamline IP management, turning
intellectual property into a liquid asset class (IPFi) with
royalty-based earnings, potentially revolutionizing the $61T IP market
much like real estate or bonds in traditional finance. 

 THORCHAIN'S ICE AGE (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 THORChain's experimental lending protocol froze $200M in user funds
as validators scrambled to prevent a death spiral triggered by its
flawed leverage model. While its core DEX remains operational, the
protocol now faces a 90-day race to restructure debt and salvage
trust, exposing yet another DeFi experiment gone wrong.
