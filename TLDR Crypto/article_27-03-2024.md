CHARGES (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 US federal prosecutors have charged crypto exchange KuCoin and its
founders with the alleged violation of anti-money laundering laws. The
exchange reportedly operated in the US without running an anti-money
laundering program or registering with US government entities. It is
said to be involved in the money transmission business with over 30
million customers. 

 CRYPTO GAME ‚ÄòMUNCHABLES‚Äô ON BLAST EXPLOITED FOR $63M (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Ethereum L2 game Munchables experienced a $62 million exploit as a
result of a North Korean developer being hired by the Munchables team.

 SOLANA WELCOMES CIRCLE‚ÄôS CROSS-CHAIN TRANSFER PROTOCOL (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Circle is partnering with Solana to introduce its cross-chain
transfer protocol to the ecosystem. Circle‚Äôs CCTP enables the secure
trading of USDC between various blockchains using a native mint and
burn process. This move will enable Solana developers to natively swap
USDC tokens from Ethereum and other EVM-compatible ecosystems. Various
Solana ecosystem participants will support CCTP right away and more
are expected to follow. 

 BITVM 2: PERMISSIONLESS VERIFICATION ON BITCOIN (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 BitVM 2 was recently launched and aims to enable any party to verify
blockchain operations. In its original format, BitVM's validation
process could only be done by previously identified verifiers, a
limitation now overcome in BitVM 2. This opens the functionality to
any party at runtime, increasing the trust and efficiency of the
system. Despite these improvements, the protocol still needs a minimum
of one honest operator to function properly.

 As the crypto landscape has heated up so has the job market. This
thread explains how potential candidates can better position

understanding the reasons for a token's existence, their function, and
how they generate value for holders. Evaluating demand and supply
mechanics, token allocation, liquidity, and mastering analytical tools
are also crucial for long-term investment strategies. It is important

support protocol growth and create tangible value.

 MEMES ARE FROM THE FUTURE. MEV ARE THE ECHOES OF THE PAST (7 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Bitcoin was the first real memecoin, its narrative buoyed by
skepticism of central banking and institutional trust erosion.
However, the memecoin space has evolved to encompass thousands of
other coins, boosted by shifting crypto trends and attention
economics. Solana recently illustrated this with its high density of
rapidly growing memecoins. However, this has led to challenges with
Solana's blockspace allocation, transaction inclusion, and a rise in
'MEV' or Maximum Extractable Value. Bitcoin now looks set to
experience its own MEV surge driven by an influx of memecoin-driven
activities. This highlights a need for deeper discussion on managing
such complexities in the broader non-EVM ecosystem.

READ) [11]

understanding the intrinsic risks of each investment, matching wagers
to market views, and considering the potential of various crypto
assets and underlying infrastructures. The thread cautions against
'index' crypto plays, suggesting they offer limited upside, and
instead recommends that investors simply purchase Bitcoin and Ethereum
for crypto exposure.
