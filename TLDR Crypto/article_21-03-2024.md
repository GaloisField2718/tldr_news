 ETHEREUM FOUNDATION REMOVES WARRANT CANARY AFTER ‚ÄòVOLUNTARY ENQUIRY
FROM A STATE AUTHORITY‚Äô (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Ethereum Foundation has reportedly received a confidential
inquiry from a state authority, resulting in the removal of its
warrant canary from the organization's website. The Foundation, a
non-profit that supports Ethereum without directly controlling it, has
mistakenly removed the warrant canary once before in 2019. Ethereum
showed little reaction in price to the news. Experts suggest such
inquiries are fairly common in the crypto industry. 

 COINBASE FILES TO LIST DOGE, LTC, AND BCH FUTURES TRADING (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Coinbase has applied to the CFTC to list Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and
Dogecoin futures trading. Should the CFTC give the green light, these
digital asset products could be available for trading as early as
April 1. The move marks a significant step towards further legitimacy
for these cryptocurrencies.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ROBINHOOD ROLLS OUT CRYPTO WALLET TO ANDROID USERS GLOBALLY (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Robinhood has officially released its crypto wallet app for Android
users worldwide. The move follows the company's successful debut of
the wallet to iOS users last year. This comes as Robinhood saw a 10%
YoY increase in its crypto business and an 89% uptick in its notional
crypto trading volume. 

 STARKNET, AN ETHEREUM LAYER 2, PLANS 'PARALLEL EXECUTION' TO MIMIC
SOLANA'S SPEED FEATURE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Starknet, an Ethereum L2, is planning to add a "parallelization"
feature as part of a Q2 upgrade. The addition aims to increase
transaction processing efficiency, resulting in better throughput and
transaction finality. This comes as a part of Starknet's 2024 roadmap,
which includes steps to curtail fees. Notably, Starknet is the largest
network in the ZK rollups category of L2 networks, which are designed
for quicker settlements based on zero-knowledge cryptography.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE UNDERVALUED LIDO OF BITCOIN (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Activity in the Bitcoin ecosystem has picked up since the
announcements and launches of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Projects such as
Babylon Chain are innovating, creating a way to generate additional
yield for Bitcoin holdings through staking and validating Proof of
Stake chains. Meanwhile, new and innovative projects like Ankr are
entering the market with offerings like Liquid Staked Bitcoin. 

 BULLISH BRAINDUMP ON BASE (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This thread explores the growth and potential of the Ethereum L2
Base. It asserts that Base differentiates itself as a 'builder chain'.
While Base was relatively slow to gain traction, the current uptick in
speculative activity, especially in memecoins, interest in the
ecosystem has been increasing significantly. The affordable gas fees
and increasing user base present ample opportunities for developers to
build applications.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ON THE ETH MISINFORMATION (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Since the SEC allowed the ETH Futures ETFs to trade on its regulated
security exchanges, it implicitly agreed ETH is a non-security and not
under SEC jurisdiction. This move, made after Ethereum transitioned to
a Proof of Stake model in 2022, suggests any delay or denial towards
an ETH ETF would be contradictory to the agency‚Äôs past actions, as
the SEC has indicated Ethereum is beyond its jurisdiction. 

 FED CHAIR POWELL: NO ‚ÄôSECRET LAB‚Äô BREWING A DIGITAL DOLLAR
SURPRISE (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has dismissed rumors that the
bank is secretly developing a CBDC, stating that no decision has been
made on whether the US should proceed with such a project. However,
Powell confirmed the bank is closely monitoring developments in the
digital asset space.
