READ) [5] 

 According to MakerDAO founder Rune, EU financial regulators may

 HOW TO SAFELY SECURE ONE‚ÄôS CRYPTO (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article provides a comprehensive guide on the most secure
methods for storing cryptocurrencies. The author discusses the
importance of considering one's threat model and offers insights into
the advantages and potential vulnerabilities of each storage method
(hardware wallet, brain wallet, and paper wallet) and ultimately

for protection. 

 TAIKO ON ZKVMS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This thread compares zkVMs with zkEVMs, making a case for zkVMs. A
zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) provides secure and verifiable
computation through zero-knowledge proofs, offering a simpler
alternative to the complex and resource-intensive zkEVMs. Taiko has
implemented a multi-prover system to ensure continued security even if
one type of proof is compromised.

 WHY 5-FIGURE ETH IS INEVITABLE (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This thread cites several factors for the bull case for Ethereum and
an eventual $10,000+ price. The early pivot to Layer 2s and the
commitment from innovative companies, like StarkWare and Coinbase, in
building L2s demonstrates industry confidence. Even though L1
transaction costs remain high, the mainnet remains a place for the
highest-security transactions, and the deflationary nature of ETH
incentivizes investors to hold. Institutions and governments seem to
be warming up to Ethereum, as demonstrated by BlackRock‚Äôs onchain
fund and the CFTC‚Äôs declaration that Ethereum is a commodity. 

 WHERE DOES BITCOIN DERIVE ITS VALUE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Bitwise highlights Bitcoin's ability to let users hold and control
their wealth independently of centralized institutions. Despite its
volatility and lack of governmental endorsement, Bitcoin's value is
underpinned by its scarce supply and high demand. Bitcoin skeptics
fail to appreciate its resistant nature to censorship and the
fundamental market principles that determine its pricing.

[15] 

 According to onchain data, the median Solana transaction latency is

mania.
