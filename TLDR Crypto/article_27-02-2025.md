MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE'S Q4 MIRRORS A CHANGING CRYPTO MARKET AS INSTITUTIONS
DOMINATE (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Coinbase's Q4 2024 report highlights a shift toward institutional
dominance, with institutional trading volume reaching $400B while
retail participation dropped to 21% ($94B), down from 36% in 2021.
This trend, along with the SEC dropping its case against Coinbase,
illustrates growing institutional adoption of crypto, with expanding
interest beyond BTC and ETH into higher-risk digital assets. 

 BITCOIN SLIDES FURTHER BELOW $85,000; ANALYST POINTS TO BASIS TRADES
UNWINDING (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bitcoin dropped below $85,000, hitting a low of $83,600â€”its weakest
level since November 2024â€”amid a broader crypto market slump driven
by institutions unwinding basis trades. The sell-off coincided with
record $1 billion outflows from U.S. Bitcoin ETFs and declining
altcoin prices, with analysts noting weak macro indicators and
stagnant CME basis metrics as key concerns. Despite optimism around
Trump-era crypto policies, market volatility and fading speculation
suggest a challenging near-term outlook before any potential recovery.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AVALANCHE LAUNCHES THE AVAX CARD (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Avalanche Foundation, in partnership with Rain, has launched the
Avalanche Card, enabling seamless crypto payments anywhere Visa is
accepted, with a focus on underbanked regions. By bridging
decentralized finance with real-world transactions, the card enables
users in Latin America, Nigeria, and Southeast Asia, to name a few, to
access stable, borderless financial solutions without reliance on
traditional banking. 

 BANK OF AMERICA TO LAUNCH USD-PEGGED CRYPTO STABLECOIN (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has announced plans to launch a
USD-pegged crypto stablecoin, contingent on favorable legislation
under the Trump administration's pro-crypto policies. Moynihan likened
stablecoins to money market funds or bank accounts, emphasizing their
utility as a natural evolution in digital payments. The bank's
potential entry into the stablecoin market aligns with its annual $4
billion investment in new technologies, signaling a strategic push
into the evolving crypto sector.

 HYPERLEAKAGE: A CRITICAL VULNERABILITY IN HYPERLIQUID'S MOBILE
LINKING FEATURE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hyperliquid, a top decentralized exchange, faces a critical security
flaw in its mobile linking feature, where QR codes transmit users'
trading private keys via URL parameters to an AWS CDNâ€”exposing them
to potential insider access. Although the keys lack withdrawal
permissions, attackers could exploit them to manipulate trades,
risking user funds and platform stability. Hyperliquid's co-founder
downplayed the issue despite a $1,000 bounty awarded for its
disclosure. This vulnerability underscores the urgent need for
stronger security protocols in DeFi to protect user assets and
maintain trust in decentralized systems. 

 5 DEFI APPLICATIONS POSSIBLE ONLY ON EIGENLAYER (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 EigenLayer's AVSs enable novel DeFi applications by allowing offchain
computation to blend with onchain security. Five specific innovations
made possible include exchange volume-based fee tiers, dynamic
asymmetric fees for AMMs, advanced options pricing for derivatives,
compliant privacy mixers with policy enforcement, and AI-powered yield
rebalancing protocols. These applications utilize AVSs like Lagrange,
Brevis, Oracle, Reclaim Protocol, and Hyperbolic Labs to perform
offchain computations cheaply, integrate trusted external data, and
automate sophisticated financial strategies. 

 BYBIT RELEASES AUDIT REPORT (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Bybit's audit report revealed that the recent hack targeting its cold
wallet stemmed from compromised servers at infrastructure partner
SAFE, not Bybit itself, with attackers injecting malicious JavaScript
code into Gnosis SAFE's UI.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MEMECOINS ARE NEVER COMING BACK (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Memecoins on Solana are effectively dead, with high-profile rugpulls
like LIBRA and MELANIA ruining investor confidence. Unlike utility
tokens or even NFTs, memecoins lack dedicated holders who believe in
an underlying project, making them purely momentum-based investments
that collapse rapidly with dwindling excitement. Nearly $4B has been
extracted through trading fees, MEV, and insider profits â€”
comparable with last cycle's NFT boom. 

 PHANTOM ACQUIRES SIMPLEHASH (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Phantom has acquired SimpleHash, a leading token data platform, to
enhance its wallet with real-time pricing, NFT metadata, and advanced
spam detection across 80+ blockchains. This marks Phantom's third
acquisition in eight months, aligning with its goal to build a
user-friendly, data-driven crypto platform. Existing SimpleHash
services will be phased out as its team integrates with Phantom to
deliver faster, more reliable asset tracking and security features for
millions of users.
