 ETHEREUM DEVELOPERS ACTIVATE PECTRA UPGRADE (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Ethereum developers successfully deployed the Pectra upgrade on May 7
at epoch 364032, marking Ethereum's largest update by number of EIPs
since the 2022 Merge. The upgrade includes 11 EIPs, notably EIP-7702
(account abstraction), EIP-7251 (increased validator limits), and
EIP-7691 (Layer 2 throughput enhancements). Key improvements such as
reduced validator onboarding time (EIP-6110), execution-layer exit
controls (EIP-7002), and access to historical block hashes (EIP-2935)
are designed to enhance scalability, decentralization, and smart
contract functionality in preparation for future milestones like
Fusaka. 

 US SENATE TO VOTE ON STABLECOIN BILL THURSDAY AMID BIPARTISAN
TENSIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The U.S. Senate will vote Thursday on the GENIUS Act, a bill that
requires stablecoins to be fully backed by U.S. dollars or short-term
Treasuries. Despite GOP leadership backing, the bill faces bipartisan
resistance, with Democrats demanding stricter safeguards on foreign
issuers and anti-money laundering rules and some Republicans raising
concerns over tech company involvement. The legislation needs 60 votes
to advance, putting pressure on sponsors to win over skeptical
lawmakers across both parties.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 STRIPE LAUNCHES STABLECOIN FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stripe has rolled out stablecoin-based accounts, allowing users in
more than 100 countries to send, receive, and hold balances in USDC
and USDB, operating similarly to traditional bank accounts. The move
targets rising global demand for dollar-backed tokens, particularly in
inflation-hit economies across Latin America. 

 CIRCLE PAYMASTER NOW SUPPORTS EOAS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Circle's Paymaster, which enables users to pay gas fees in USDC, now
supports externally owned accounts (EOAs) via EIP-7702. The feature is
rolling out across seven blockchains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum,
Base, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, and Unichain, removing the need
for users to hold native tokens for gas fees.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 PENDLE: THE MOST UNDERPRICED DEFI PRIMITIVE IN CRYPTO (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Pendle transformed from a yield platform into a foundational DeFi
layer, growing TVL from $230M to $4.4B in 2024 and daily trading
volume to nearly $100M. With rising institutional adoption and
protocol integrations, Pendle is expanding to non-EVM chains via
“Citadels” and developing new products like Boros to tokenize
perpetual funding rates. Despite strong momentum, its $577M market cap
remains well below its $1B FDV, signaling potential upside as V2
initiatives gain traction. 

 TIME VALUE OF INTERNET MONEY (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Pendle adapts traditional coupon‐stripping to crypto by wrapping
yield‐bearing tokens into SY and splitting them into principal
tokens (PT) for fixed‐yield bets and yield tokens (YT) for
variable‐rate speculation. By integrating point‐farming campaigns,
its TVL exploded from $230 M to nearly $6.7B in early 2024, settling
around $2.9B today. Unlike government‐set rates, crypto yields
derive mathematically (e.g., Ethereum staking and Solana inflation),
so pricing PT and YT demands a framework that accounts for variable
rates, AMM liquidity dynamics, and point‐driven volatility. Tailored
risk management tools, including dynamic LTV curves, liquidity
penalties, and collateral valuation models, are required to safely
integrate Pendle's fixed-income primitives into DeFi protocols.

 X402: ABSOLVING THE INTERNET OF ITS ORIGINAL SIN (4 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Coinbase's new x402 protocol addresses the internet's “original
sin” by enabling native value transfer through wallet-based
payments. x402 allows AI agents to autonomously discover and pay for
APIs and services such as content paywalls, LLM inference, and data by
using USDC microtransactions, with no accounts or keys required.
Building on AgentKit's 20,000+ wallet-enabled agents, x402 unlocks
real-world utility and full financial autonomy for AI. 

 WEB3: CRYPTO'S BIGGEST MISTAKE (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto's early embrace of the “fat protocol thesis” misdiagnosed
the value of tokenizing non-financial apps like social media and
gaming, overlooking the high costs of trustlessness. As institutions
adopt blockchain for efficiency, not speculation, value is shifting
from infrastructure tokens to practical applications. The next phase
of crypto must return to its roots: building better digital money as
foundational infrastructure for the broader economy. 

 ZEREBRO FOUNDER'S POTENTIAL STAGED FAKE DEATH (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Zerebro developer Jeffy Yu appeared to stage a livestreamed suicide
shortly after launching the meme token $LLJEFFY, prompting speculation
and briefly driving up the token's value. However, later updates and
evidence, including deleted obituaries and activity from linked crypto
wallets, suggest he faked his death either as an exit strategy or
artistic statement, leading to confusion and financial losses for some
traders.
