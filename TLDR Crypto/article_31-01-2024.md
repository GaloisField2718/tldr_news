 SEC LIKELY TO APPROVE SPOT ETHEREUM ETFS ON MAY 23: STANDARD
CHARTERED BANK (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Standard Chartered Bank is anticipating that the SEC will approve
spot Ethereum ETFs by the final deadline of May 23, following the same
path the regulators took with the Bitcoin ETFs. It is predicting a
runup in ETH‚Äôs price leading up to the anticipated approval,
emulating Bitcoin‚Äôs performance prior to its ETF approval. Experts
believe there is a strong argument for approval since Ethereum has
already been listed as a regulated futures contract on the CME. 

 TRANSAK JOINS VISA DIRECT FOR SIMPLER CRYPTO-TO-FIAT PAYMENTS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Visa Direct and Transak have partnered to enable easy and quick
crypto-to-fiat conversions across 145 countries. Transak claims that
while many platforms can handle fiat-to-crypto conversions, the
reverse is often challenging. With this partnership, Transak aims to
deliver expeditious, secure, and compliant crypto-to-fiat conversion,
which is particularly crucial for users needing to completely exit the
crypto markets.

ECOSYSTEM (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ethereum scaling solution Starknet is partnering with blockchain
network Celestia to enhance data availability for L3 chains. Starknet
will employ Blobstream, a feature from Celestia, to securely store
large amounts of off-chain data and effectively reduce transaction
costs. Starknet developers will then adapt Blobstream to Cairo,
Starknet's main programming language, to facilitate the development of
L3 app chains. 

 BITCOIN-BASED DEX PORTAL RAISES $34 MILLION IN SEED FUNDING FROM
COINBASE VENTURES AND OTHERS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bitcoin-based startup Portal raised $34 million in a recent seed
funding round as it gears up to launch on mainnet in March. Portal,
which enables cryptocurrency swaps across various blockchains through
atomic swaps, plans to cement its position by supporting as many
wallets and decentralized exchanges as possible to remove the risks of
centralized bridges from the ecosystem and introduce the security of
its fully non-custodial solution. The funding round will be used to
launch an AI-driven investment application aimed at assisting users in
making informed investment choices.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STATE OF BRIDGING (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The crypto ecosystem faces complexity as the number of assets and
chains increases. Bridges play an increasingly vital role in reducing
this complexity by helping users with asset transfers and swaps.
Distinguishing features of bridges include distribution, product
offerings, and security profiles. Coinciding with the rapid
proliferation of new chains and the increasing demand for better user
experiences, bridges have become a crucial service provider in the
crypto landscape. However, they also are one of the main attack
vectors in the space.

AI, a process that contains many potential pitfalls and would require
extremely careful implementation.
