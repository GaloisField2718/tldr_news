 CHAINLINK AND SWIFT PILOT TOKENIZED FUND WORKFLOWS WITH UBS (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Chainlink and Swift have launched a UBS Tokenize pilot that uses
Swift messages and Chainlink's Runtime Environment to trigger onchain
subscription and redemption workflows for tokenized funds without
requiring banks to replace legacy infrastructure. The system builds on
prior Project Guardian work and uses Chainlink's Digital Transfer
Agent standard, with Swift handling ISO 20022-compliant messaging.
Coming days after Chainlink's AI-driven pilot for corporate actions,
the collaboration positions Swift's global network and Chainlink's
smart contracts as a plug-and-play gateway for the $100T+ fund
industry to adopt tokenization at scale. 

 SEC WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH TOKENIZED ASSET ISSUERS (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said the regulator is willing to
engage with industry participants on tokenizing products, urging them
to proactively communicate with the agency while emphasizing the
complexity of how tokenized assets interact with traditional forms of
the same security. Speaking at the Digital Assets Summit in Singapore,
Peirce highlighted that depending on how assets are tokenized, they
could represent "one of many different things," requiring a nuanced
regulatory approach to handle scenarios where the same security exists
simultaneously in paper, electronic, and blockchain-based token forms.
The tokenization market currently stands at $31 billion with $714
million in tokenized stocks, and McKinsey projects the market could
reach $2 trillion by 2030 as financial institutions increasingly adopt
tokenization to enhance liquidity and operational efficiency.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING OPEN ISSUANCE FROM STRIPE AND BRIDGE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bridge's Open Issuance is a platform that allows any business to
create and manage custom stablecoins in just days while handling
reserve management, security, liquidity, and GENIUS-ready compliance.
It addresses the limitation of building on external stablecoin
providers, where businesses face unpredictable fees and lack control
over economics or product roadmaps. The platform enables full
customization, including blockchain support, smart contract
functionality, and reserve mix allocations balanced between cash and
treasuries through partnerships with BlackRock, Fidelity, and
Superstate, while providing tools for adoption. Open Issuance solves
the liquidity challenge through a unified network where businesses can
enable one-for-one interoperability swaps between Open Issuance
stablecoins, expanding overall liquidity as new coins launch and
allowing instant, permissionless onchain transactions without
intermediaries. Existing Bridge-issued coins will migrate to the new
platform. 

 VISA TESTS STABLECOIN PAYMENTS FOR CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Visa has launched a pilot allowing businesses to pre-fund Visa Direct
with USDC and EURC, treating them as available balances for instant
cross-border payouts instead of locking up fiat days in advance. The
initiative aims to cut settlement times from days to minutes, improve
liquidity access, and support programmable payments, with limited
availability planned by April 2026. While Visa is not ruling out
issuing its own stablecoin, the focus is on scaling existing assets,
extending its broader stablecoin strategy that includes card-linked
spending, African payments with Yellow Card, and developer
integrations via Stripe-owned Bridge.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO ACT LIKE A GENIUS? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The GENIUS Act establishes a federal framework for payment
stablecoins, allowing banks and federally recognized nonbanks to issue
stablecoins under strict reserve, custody, governance, and compliance
rules. State issuers can participate if their regimes substantially
mirror federal standards and issuance stays under $10 billion.
Compliance requirements include face-value redemptions within defined
timeframes, backing with safe liquid assets like cash and short-dated
Treasuries with monthly reserve reports, capital buffers above
reserves, full AML/BSA programs, lawful freeze capabilities, and
prohibitions against coercive tying arrangements that force stablecoin
usage for other services. The framework prohibits paying holders
interest for simply using or holding stablecoins but allows rewards
tied to usage, loyalty programs, whitelabeled issuance, and merchant
involvement focused on service value rather than interest
distributions. Only US-formed entities can issue domestically for full
access. Foreign issuers face restrictions and second-tier status
unless exceptional compliance is achieved. Key implementation dates
include regulator rulemaking by July 2026, GENIUS taking effect by
January 2027, and restricted status for non-compliant foreign
stablecoins on US platforms by July 2028. 

 YOU CAN JUST DO THINGS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Despite building MegaETH, a scaling protocol with "ETH" in its name,
the Mega team hadn't spoken to the Ethereum Foundation until two weeks
ago, when they joined a call with the foundation chair, research lead,
and ecosystem head that felt more like a customer interview than a
formal partnership discussion. Despite eight years in crypto and
building at Consensys, the author had never interacted with the EF
either, highlighting Ethereum's unique approach of "not grabbing
power, but giving it up" as the most counterintuitive and inspiring
ideology in crypto. Beyond ideological considerations, Ethereum
represents the "Sleeping Beauty" test - if you had to park money for
twenty years, you'd choose Bitcoin or Ethereum over newer chains
because "your money is safu onchain for many years to come."
Ethereum's authenticity and innocence shine through its
community-oriented approach, with even Foundation alignment rituals
feeling more like community theater than power grabs, though its real
struggle lies in communicating its timeless story to a world that
anchors feelings on price, experiences, and social proof rather than
decentralization principles.

 PLASMA'S COSTLY DECENTRALIZATION HIGHLIGHTS L2 ADVANTAGE (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 While Plasma achieved record-breaking TVL in its first week, its path
to decentralization reveals the downside of L1 architecture.
Onboarding validators will cost $550M annually at a 5% inflation rate,
despite users already deploying capital without this guarantee. With
L2s, security costs scale with transaction volume instead of being a
fixed burden, making rollup models more operationally efficient. 

 ACP: A STANDARD FOR AGENTIC SHOPPING FLOWS (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Agentic Commerce Protocol defines a common flow for agents to
discover products, signal intent, render carts with taxes, and
initiate payment instructions. Positioned alongside Cloudflare x402,
AXTP, Google A2P, and Visa's Intelligent Commerce, these standards
will coexist to solve different parts of agent-driven commerce.
