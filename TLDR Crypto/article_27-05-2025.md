MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO INDUSTRY URGES SEC TO CLARIFY STAKING STANCE (5 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Crypto industry groups, led by the Crypto Council for Innovation, are
urging the SEC to issue formal guidance on staking amid ongoing
regulatory uncertainty for web3 infrastructure providers. While the
SEC has recently clarified that memecoins and stablecoins are not
securities, it has yet to define compliant staking frameworks or
approve staking in ETFs. The industry is optimistic about upcoming
staking-enabled cryptocurrency ETFs and continues productive meetings
with the agency. At the same time, firms are pushing back against the
IRS' classification of staking rewards as service income. 

 TRUMP CRYPTO DINNER GOES POORLY (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A TikTok prankster who paid ~$300,000 for a seat at Trump's memecoin
holder dinner called the three-course meal “trash,” likening the
filet mignon to “Walmart steak.” He also dismissed Trump's brief,
scripted speech praising crypto as “something special” as
“pretty much like bullshit,” noting the president departed before
presenting watches to top token holders. Other attendees described the
food as merely “OK” and reported similar disappointment with the
event's organization. Meanwhile, 35 Democratic lawmakers are urging a
Justice Department probe into potential foreign-emoluments violations
stemming from the international guest list.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 LAGRANGE TOKEN LAUNCH (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Lagrange has launched $LA, its native token used to pay for
cryptographic proofs that power things like ZK rollups and verifiable
AI. Clients pay fees (in $ETH, $USDC, or $LA), and the system converts
those into $LA to reward provers, creating steady demand for the
token. Token holders can stake or delegate $LA to support specific
provers, helping scale the network while reducing supply and boosting
long-term value. 

 MAMO: AN AI AGENT FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mamo is a non-custodial AI agent that automates passive wealth
creation by scanning trusted DeFi vaults and compounding earnings.
Launched from a 2025 Coinbase AI hackathon, Mamo communicates like a
friendly assistant, explaining every move and answering questions
24/7. Its ecosystem is powered by the community-aligned MAMO token,
with no VC backing or team unlocks, and is free to use during the
introductory period. By supporting social login, passkey wallets, and
debit-card funding, Mamo aims to make onchain yield strategies
accessible to both crypto newcomers and veterans.

 HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF AFTER A PERSONAL DATA BREACH: 5 STEPS (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 If your personal data is exposed in a breach, attackers can use it to
escalate their access through phishing, identity theft, and account
takeovers. To protect yourself, take immediate action: freeze your
credit, strengthen MFA, replace compromised IDs, secure key accounts
(Apple, Google, etc), use a password manager, and lock down your
phone. Stay vigilant for scams, monitor your social media, and treat
cybersecurity as a necessity, not an option. 

 16 TAKEAWAYS FROM DELPHI DIGITAL'S 2025 TOKENIZATION REPORT (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 2025 is the most favorable environment yet for onchain finance.
Driven by regulatory tailwinds and breakthroughs in real-world asset
(RWA) infrastructure, the shift from proxy tokens to fully compliant,
tradable securities is underway, with leaders like Securitize, Dinari,
and Kraken building regulated, chain-agnostic systems for tokenized
equities, funds, and credit. The long-term value lies not just in the
assets, but in the protocols powering 24/7, compliant onchain rails.

 SUI VALIDATORS FREEZE STOLEN FUNDS IN $220M HACK (5 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Validators on the Sui network have frozen approximately $162 million
of the $223 million stolen from the Cetus DEX on May 22 and are
working alongside the Cetus team and the Sui Foundation to recover the
remaining funds. The exploit drained user assets via a smart-contract
vulnerability, with $63 million bridged to Ethereum and 20,000 ETH
(≈$53 million) laundered through a single wallet. While the asset
freeze offers relief to victims, some community members have raised
concerns about censorship resistance, noting that 114 validators could
unilaterally block transactions. 

 POTENTIAL COINBASE CIRCLE ACQUISITION ANALYSIS (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Though Coinbase drives most of the USDC volume, it only receives 50%
of its revenue. Circle, by contrast, captures full protocol revenue on
all $60 billion of USDC in circulation and controls the
smart-contract, cross-chain bridging, and governance layers, making it
a “TAM play” rather than a margin business. Owning Circle would
give Coinbase 100% revenue attribution across the entire USDC supply,
full protocol control to monetize onchain wallets and its Base L2, and
a consolidated regulatory position. With Circle exploring a $5 billion
IPO and USDC's reserve income forecast to reach $20 billion annually,
acquiring Circle for anywhere between $10–20 billion aligns with
both companies' strategic and financial incentives.
