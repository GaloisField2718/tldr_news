MARKETS & BUSINESS

 WILL ARGENTINIAN PRESIDENT MILEI'S CRYPTO 'FIASCO' BE A DEATHBLOW FOR
MEMECOIN CRAZE? (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The LIBRA token, which resulted in approximately $4.5 billion in
retail losses, has become an international political crisis as
allegations emerged that key player Hayden Davis had claimed to have
bought access to Milei's inner circle through payments to the
president's sister. This accusation led to impeachment threats and a
6% drop in Argentina's stock market. The controversy, which resulted
in the resignation of Solana DEX Meteora's co-founder, has dealt a
significant blow to the memecoin sector's reputation, with industry
analysts suggesting it may be the saturation point for memecoin
trading following the TRUMP and MELANIA launches. 

 MILLIONS WORTH OF STOLEN FUNDS FROM PHEMEX HACK ARE ON THE MOVE, SOME
TO TORNADO CASH CRYPTO MIXER (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hackers behind the $85 million Phemex exploit are actively moving
stolen funds through various crypto platforms, including the
sanctioned mixer Tornado Cash, to obscure their tracks. Investigators
suspect the attack was carried out by an experienced group, possibly
linked to North Korea, as Phemex tightens its security measures.
