MARKETS & BUSINESS

 WHITE HOUSE CRYPTO COUNCIL HEAD BO HINES TO STEP DOWN (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Bo Hines, executive director of the White House's crypto council, is
stepping down and returning to the private sector. His deputy, Patrick
Witt, will take over. Hines, appointed by President Trump in late
2024, met with over 150 crypto leaders during his tenure and will
continue advising on AI initiatives under David Sacks. 

 HOW HIGH WILL ETHEREUM GO AFTER BREAKING $4K? (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ethereum surged 24% this week to above $4,330, breaking key
resistance around $4,200 in its highest rally since December 2021.
Analysts see a Wyckoff Accumulation breakout in play, with a potential
move toward $6,000 if the new uptrend holds. A simultaneous breakout
from a multi-year symmetrical triangle points to an $8,000 target in
the coming months, echoing past multi-month rallies triggered by
similar patterns.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE LAUNCHES RETAIL DEX WITH AERODROME (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Aerodrome is now fully integrated into Coinbase's frontend, making
every Base asset, pool, and launch on Aerodrome instantly accessible
to 100M+ Coinbase users. Unlike protocols reliant on proprietary
frontends, Aerodrome's design rewards integrations, allowing for
deeper liquidity, wider reach, and more rewards for $AERO lockers. 

 WORLD MOBILE LAUNCHES DRONE-BASED, DECENTRALIZED TELECOM PROJECT (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 World Mobile has partnered with Indonesia's Protelindo to launch a
blockchain-enabled 5G network using hydrogen-powered drones in the
stratosphere, delivering wireless coverage of up to 15,000 sq km per
aircraft. Operating at 60,000 feet with 6ms latency, the system claims
to provide connectivity up to 18x cheaper per gigabyte than
satellite-based services. The company is targeting a share of the
$98.3B sky-based telecom market, positioning itself against
competitors like Helium Mobile and Starlink by focusing on areas with
higher mobile user density.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE EXHAUSTION OF THE METAGAME: CRYPTO IN ITS POST SLOP ERA (9 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Crypto has entered a “post-slop” era where hype-driven token
launches and influencer campaigns no longer drive lasting
value—projects must now deliver tangible utility and sustained user
activity to earn market trust. The rise of platforms like Kaito
exposed the mechanics of paid promotion, but moving forward, only
reputation, real products, and sticky liquidity will stand out.
Historical cycles—from DeFi Summer to Solana's
resurgence—underscore that genuine community engagement and on-chain
usage, not endorsements or content volume, fuel long-term success. As
quality and transparency become paramount, projects like Hyperliquid
that inspire true confidence and put capital at risk are poised to
lead the next phase of crypto innovation. 

 LAUNCH BY KINETIQ (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Launch by Kinetiq is the first “Exchange-as-a-Service” on
Hyperliquid's HIP-3 protocol. It lets any team crowdfund the 1
million+ HYPE stake needed to deploy perpetual futures markets without
building backend infrastructure. Launch pools contributor capital into
isolated exHYPE tokens per exchange, so slashing events only affect
the specific market's staking pool, and fees are distributed
transparently to backers. Operators focus on market curation,
governance, and community, while HYPE holders earn dynamic yields by
choosing which deployments to support. This Shopify-meets-Kickstarter
model democratizes perp exchange creation, expands market diversity,
and unlocks new yield primitives across the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

 COINBASE DEX TRADING SHIFTS POWER, SIDESTEPS UNISWAP (1 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 As Coinbase rolls out DEX trading to millions of users, Uniswap's
frontend fee revenue faces disruption. Unlike Aerodrome, which
incentivizes integrations through protocol-based rewards to $AERO
lockers, Uniswap Labs profits from its own interface, creating
friction with alternative frontends like Coinbase. While Uniswap's
moat is built on brand trust, Aerodrome's is built into its smart
contracts. The “DeFi mullet” shift, TradFi frontend with DeFi
backend, could reroute flows and flip the competitive edge. 

 LINK BUYBACKS SIGNAL NEW ERA FOR CHAINLINK (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Chainlink is entering a new phase as token buybacks begin, aligning
network success with $LINK value accrual for the first time. Long
dubbed a “dino coin,” the project has quietly built one of the
deepest moats in crypto, powering mission-critical infrastructure and
onboarding top financial institutions under Sergey Nazarov's
leadership. With hundreds of millions already in revenue and no
regulatory roadblocks for onchain finance, LINK is now positioned as a
prime beneficiary of the institutional adoption cycle.
