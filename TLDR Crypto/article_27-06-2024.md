MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN ETFS SEE $31M IN INFLOWS, BREAKING OUTFLOW STREAK (1 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Following a week of net outflows, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs recorded $31
million in net inflows, primarily coming from Fidelity's FBTC and
Bitwise's BITB. The inflows occurred as expectations increased around
the launch of spot ether ETFs. 

 CRYPTO GIANTS NOTCH WINS IN EXPENSIVE QUEST TO SWAY U.S. POLITICS â€“
WITHOUT MENTIONING CRYPTO (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The crypto industry has significant political influence in the 2024
US election through a $169 million campaign fund managed by the
Fairshake PAC. Companies like Coinbase, Ripple, and a16z are financing
the fund but rarely discuss its decision-making process. In pursuing
its goal of de-politicizing crypto, it has supported over 20
congressional primary wins and is preparing to influence races beyond
the 2024 election cycle.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PARADIGM RELEASES RETH 1.0 (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Paradigm has announced the release of Reth 1.0, a production-ready
Ethereum execution client, after two years of development and a
successful audit by Sigma Prime. It features reduced costs and
enhanced stability, performance, security, and service performance.
The team behind Reth 1.0 has invited industry players to integrate it
into their Ethereum mainnet infrastructure. 

 WORMHOLE: THE FIRST DISTRIBUTED SECURE SERVICE ON KARAK (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Wormhole has partnered with restaking protocol Karak to develop two
DSSs: a decentralized validator network for token transfers and a
decentralized relay network. The validator network will make transfers
more secure and decentralized, while the relay network sends messages
between chains cheaply. This is the first major protocol to build on
Karak, demonstrating interest in restaking beyond EigenLayer.

 ETH SUPPLY CHAIN FUTURE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethereum is moving towards a future where block attesters and
proposers are different. There are a few proposals about how to
achieve this meta in a decentralized manner. The design goals are to
isolate timing games, incentivizing proposers to delay block proposals
to make money, and burn MEV to make the protocol easier to reason
about. The protocol must be conscious of not creating new economic
attacks or perverse incentives that further promote centralization or
block manipulation. 

 A DEEP DIVE INTO NFT ROYALTIES (19 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 NFT royalties, crucial for ensuring creators get paid for secondary
sales, face challenges as they have never been enforced onchain. It is
difficult to distinguish sales from other transfers like gifts. New
designs that balance strict royalty enforcement and the flexibility of
NFT interactions are being explored to address this, with innovative
approaches such as incentive mechanisms and staking models being
proposed to encourage respect for royalties without compromising
composability.

 DENMARK TO BAN ALL CRYPTO INTERFACES (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The latest DeFi guidance from the Danish Financial Supervisory
Authority (DFSA) suggests a move towards heavy regulation of all
crypto interfaces, including Bitcoin wallets, by classifying them as
interface providers that must be regulated. This regulatory guidance
may lead to a ban on unregulated p2p and unhosted wallets, aligning
with past regulatory suggestions seen in other parts of the EU. Given
MICA regulation recently coming into play, some see this as an
overreach that could harm crypto use in Denmark. 

 ABSTRACTION TO ADOPTION (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Chain abstraction, which involves developers building infrastructure
to work across dozens of different standards, has become a popular
narrative. It would allow developers to deploy applications to the
blockchain of their choice and users to seamlessly interact across
chains. Its implementation will be a catalyzing moment for crypto and
a step towards mass adoption.
