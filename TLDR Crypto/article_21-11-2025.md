MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BANKS' CRYPTO RULES MUST BE REWORKED (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Basel Committee chair Erik Thedéen acknowledged crypto capital rules
need reworking after the US and UK refused to implement the 2021
framework requiring banks to hold large capital reserves against
crypto losses, with Fed Vice-Chair Michelle Bowman calling the rules
"not very realistic." The original framework focused on volatile
assets like Bitcoin but failed to account for stablecoins' rapid
growth and lower risk profiles. The Bank of England declined to
implement the rules in their current form as the committee faces
pressure to quickly reassess whether stablecoins warrant the same
capital treatment as traditional cryptocurrencies ahead of the
framework's planned January implementation. 

 BITCOIN HOLDS AMID SELL PRESSURE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin absorbed $228 million in long-term holder sales as trading
volume rose 5% to $81 billion, while over $600 million in leveraged
futures liquidated primarily from unwinding bullish positions.
Altcoins declined with ETH down 3.4% and the altcoin season index
falling to 26/100, though Cosmos surged 10% on a technical breakout
and Zcash extended its two-month rally with an 8.7% gain. Memecoins
are underperforming the rest of the market.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AZTEC IGNITION CHAIN IS LIVE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Aztec launched Ignition Chain on the Ethereum mainnet, positioning it
as the first fully decentralized L2 after the validator queue hit 500,
triggering block production with 525 validators now running across 125
nodes. Staking requires 200,000 AZTEC tokens per validator node and
currently offers 167% APY as early sequencer rewards accelerate
decentralization. The AZTEC token sale launches on December 2 with a
$350 million starting floor that increases with demand, featuring
early access for select solo staker communities, with tokens used for
staking, governance, and block rewards. 

 HELLOTRADE: FRICTIONLESS ACCESS TO GLOBAL EQUITIES (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 HelloTrade was founded by former BlackRock crypto directors Wyatt
Raich and Kevin Tang, who launched IBIT, the fastest ETF to $100
billion in assets. Built on MegaETH's 100,000+ TPS infrastructure, the
mobile-first platform will offer leveraged exposure to global stocks,
ETFs, commodities, and crypto without wallet setup or gas payments to
remove geography and capital requirement barriers. The iOS and Android
apps will launch soon with an active waitlist at hello.trade.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STABLECOIN CARDS VS BANKS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Today's stablecoin cards ride on Visa and issuing banks'
infrastructure, taking a slice of interchange while offering better
UX, global access, DeFi yield on idle balances, and token-subsidized
cashback, which makes them look insanely attractive but effectively
eats into banks' margins. This won't last forever because, as crypto
cards start replacing primary bank accounts rather than adding extra
volume, banks and regulators will fight back by squeezing interchange
and reclaiming economics, forcing stablecoin card players either to
own more of the payment stack (licenses, rails, maybe bank-to-bank or
wallet-to-wallet) or accept a hard cap on their upside. 

 THE GREAT CONSOLIDATION (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Great Consolidation is accelerating as $70 billion in altcoin
unlocks approach and fragmented liquidity across 25,000+ daily token
launches becomes unsustainable, with most alts down 50-70% from highs
as Bitcoin dominance rises and institutional flows bypass alt season
entirely. The industry must consolidate memes toward lindy names,
eliminate copycat Alt-L1 ecosystems offering no unique value
proposition, and push apps toward superapp models as solo farming
becomes unprofitable and retail rejects low float, high FDV exit
liquidity games. Ethereum faces existential challenges, capturing only
1% of Base fees while ETH/BTC hits multi-year lows with no clear value
accrual narrative as L2 fragmentation and stablecoin adoption
undermine the moneyness thesis, though blobs and potential L2
"tariffs" offer long-term scalability paths. Winners will be
fee-generating protocols like Aave, Ethena, Uniswap, and Hyperliquid
that established product-market fit before token launch as
fundamentals replace speculation and supply overhangs crush
hype-driven projects.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE REAL SUPERCYCLE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The “supercycle” is happening quietly in fundamentals, not
prices. Most speculative tokens and 2021 narratives are dying, while
critical infrastructure like Ethereum/Solana, stablecoins, RWAs, and
DeFi protocols with real fees keep making new highs in usage and TVL.
Regulatory clarity plus integrations from Visa, Mastercard, Stripe,
neobanks, and apps like Cash App and Revolut are wiring stablecoins
into global payments, and as rates fall, capital should rotate from
Treasuries into onchain, fee-based yield. The next leg comes from AI
agents using blockchains as their native financial backend, meaning
we've already hit escape velocity even if 90% of legacy coins never
recover. 

 DECENTRALIZATION OR BUST (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Today's “dead” crypto vibe is less about price and more about the
industry forgetting its purpose. BTC is increasingly treated as a Wall
Street ETF game. Much of crypto has been reduced to casino tokens
rather than tools for censorship resistance and permissionless value
transfer. If assets are custodial and centralized, they become as
seizable as any bank IOU and drift toward ponzi-like dynamics where
new buyers don't strengthen the network, only transfer wealth to early
holders. Refocus relentlessly on decentralization and self-custody,
avoid perps and degen trading with most of your net worth, hold a core
stack of BTC/ETH/NFTs you truly value, keep working in the real world,
and remember that most coins and JPEGs will go to zero, but the long
game of decentralized systems is still worth playing.

 ETHEREUM INTEROPERABILITY LAYER TO MAKE L2S FEEL LIKE ONE CHAIN (1
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Ethereum's Interoperability Layer, set to launch in 2026, will let

liquidity providers handle gas and settlement across multiple L2s
behind the scenes, making all Ethereum L2s feel like one unified chain
without relying on trusted middlemen. 

 BLACKROCK LINES UP STAKED ETHEREUM ETF (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 BlackRock is preparing a second ETH ETF focused on staking, likely
staking most of the fund for higher real yield while only partially
staking assets in its original ETH product.
