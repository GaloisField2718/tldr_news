MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN PRICE HITS $86K AS TRUMP TARIFF RELIEF BOOSTS BREAKOUT ODDS
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin hit an 11-day high of $86K as tariff relief on certain
Chinese products boosted market sentiment despite recent lows and
concerns about weekend volatility. Technical indicators, like the
200-day EMA and bullish RSI divergences, will predict whether the
breakout will hold. However, prior retraces after daily improvements
signal that a sustained rally depends on a successful retest of
resistance levels. 

 CZ DENIES ALLEGATIONS THAT HE PROVIDED EVIDENCE AGAINST JUSTIN SUN TO
DOJ (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Binance founder CZ is pushing back against a Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) report claiming he gave evidence against TRON founder Justin Sun
as part of his DOJ plea deal which he characterized as a smear
campaign. The WSJ report noted that Binance executives are lobbying to
ease Treasury Department oversight and are exploring listing the
Trump-related stablecoin USD1.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 VIRTUALS PROTOCOL'S GENESIS POINTS PROGRAM (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Genesis Launch is a fair and permissionless token distribution method
for agents within the Virtuals Protocol that aims to expand early
exposure to a broad base of ecosystem contributors. The model uses a
contribution-weighted point system where participants earn points
through meaningful on-chain and off-chain actions, which are used for
token allocation. The approach improves holder alignment, increases
market velocity, and mitigates shady launch tactics. 

 A MAXIMALLY SIMPLE L1 PRIVACY ROADMAP (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Vitalik Buterin's privacy roadmap is a straightforward approach to
improving Ethereum's privacy with minimal consensus changes by
addressing four key areas: onchain payment privacy, application-level
anonymization, private RPC reads, and network-level obfuscation. It
advocates for integrating privacy tools directly into existing
wallets, including features like shielded balances and default privacy
for self-transfers to minimize public user linkages. It also calls for
technical upgrades such as EIP-7701, deploying TEE-based RPCs, and
utilizing mixnet connections to reduce metadata leakage.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 SEC'S GUIDANCE ON TOKEN DISCLOSURES (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The SEC's Division of Corporation Finance issued new guidance on how
crypto-related companies should disclose information when registering
or offering securities. Aiming to improve investor protection and
market clarity, it outlines detailed expectations around business
descriptions, risk factors, crypto asset functionality, and technical
specs and encourages clear, tailored disclosures based on each
issuer's specific operations and stage of development. 

 THOUGHTS ON THE $PROMPT TGE (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There has been backlash around the $PROMPT token generation event
(TGE). Much of the frustration stems from unmet expectations and
comparisons between participants. Observers remain optimistic about
$PROMPT's long-term potential, though communication missteps and
uneven reward distribution, especially from the Kaito program, are key
issues.

 SWEET BETRAYAL (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 PancakeSwap's proposed “Tokenomics 3.0” update is drawing sharp
backlash for dismantling veCAKE, its long-term governance model, just
as a mysterious wallet locked nearly half the CAKE supply to
potentially influence the vote. Critics argue that the move undermines
long-standing contributors such as Cakepie and Stake DAO, centralizes
power, and undermines DeFi's decentralization ideals. The update has
sparked widespread community resistance and calls for a more
transparent, inclusive solution. 

 CRYPTO'S BIGGEST BARRIER TO ADOPTION IS UX (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The biggest barrier to crypto adoption in 2025 is poor user
experience, not regulation. Wallets remain unintuitive and fragmented
for everyday users. Achieving mass adoption will require the industry
to embrace human-centered design and innovations like account
abstraction to make crypto tools secure and accessible without
sacrificing decentralization or self-custody.
