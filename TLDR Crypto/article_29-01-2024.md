brand-customer collaborations. While Overpass is limited to Pudgy

 THE EMERGENCE OF AI AND CRYPTO SYNERGIES (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog by Grayscale Research outlines how crypto assets linked to
AI have gained traction recently, outpacing other sectors in the same
time period. Amid concerns about AI centralization and data privacy,
many believe crypto might offer useful solutions. For instance,
Worldcoin aims to combat misinformation by uniquely identifying users
through biometric scans. Other initiatives, like Bittensor, work to
reduce AI bias by rewarding top-performing diverse models.
Decentralized marketplaces such as Akash and Render could democratize
AI development by connecting developers with affordable computing
resources.

 COMPUTER VS. CASINO: CRYPTO‚ÄôS CULTURE WAR (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post discusses the ongoing culture war in crypto between the
technical and financial sides of the space. It contrasts the "Crypto
computer" group, who believe in the decentralization and
disintermediation ideals of crypto‚Äôs founders, against the "Crypto
casino" camp, who treats the space as a speculative platform. While
speculation may be a part of crypto, it should be used to drive new
positive-sum use cases to bring more people into the industry rather
than encouraging harmful financial practices. 

 CRYPTO PROJECTS HAVE GIVEN OUT 40 BILLION POINTS SO FAR. WHEN WILL IT
END? (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There is growing disdain towards the trend of projects giving out
"points" as rewards instead of tokens. Critics view points as useless
IOUs and a departure from potentially lucrative airdrops. They point
out that users have been burned by points programs that never
delivered any value to users. On the other hand, VCs see an upside in
points due to their flexibility, lower regulatory risk, and potential
to drive customer engagement and loyalty. With both pros and cons,
it‚Äôs still up for debate whether points are a passing fad or a
future norm in the crypto space.
