 DIGITAL CHAMBER CALLS FOR CONGRESS TO ADDRESS SEC ACTIONS AGAINST
NFTS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Digital Chamber has urged Congress to clarify the legal status of
NFTs, advocating for them to be classified as consumer goods rather
than securities in response to the SEC's potential regulatory action
against OpenSea. This comes after OpenSea received a Wells notice,
which suggests the SEC might take enforcement steps, reflecting
broader concerns over regulation in the NFT space.

MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The 2024 congressional elections are seen as pivotal for the future
of crypto regulation, with much of the industry's political spending

 TETHER, TRON, AND TRM JOIN FORCES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tether, TRON, and TRM Labs have launched the T3 Financial Crime Unit
(T3 FCU), a groundbreaking private sector initiative aimed at
combating crypto-related crimes on the TRON blockchain, especially
involving USDT. By combining blockchain intelligence and anti-crime
expertise, the unit has already assisted law enforcement in freezing
over $12 million linked to various scams, marking a proactive step in
safeguarding the crypto ecosystem. 

 PAYPAL AND VENMO INTEGRATE ENS FOR CRYPTO TRANSFERS (1 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 ENS (Ethereum Name Service) integration on PayPal and Venmo now

addresses, simplifying transactions and enhancing security. This

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BASED ROLLUPS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 "Based Rollups" could significantly boost demand for ETH by
restructuring validator incentives. By allowing Layer 2 rollups to tap
into Layer 1 validators for processing, validators can earn additional
income, enhancing ETH staking returns without increasing supply,
potentially driving long-term ETH value higher as Ethereum becomes
more deflationary and yield remains competitive. 

 BREAKDOWN OF HARDWARE WALLETS AS STORAGE OPTIONS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hardware wallets, often misunderstood as long-term storage devices
for private keys, actually serve to securely generate and use private
keys for signing transactions, functioning like a mini air-gapped
computer. They do not replace the need for a robust protocol for
physically or digitally storing and recovering your private key, given
that hardware wallets can fail and passwords may be lost.

revenue.
