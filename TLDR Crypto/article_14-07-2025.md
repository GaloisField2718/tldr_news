MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE SUES OREGON GOVERNOR OVER POLICY SHIFT (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Coinbase has filed suit against Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, accusing
her office of withholding records tied to a surprise state lawsuit
that reclassified crypto as securities after previously stating
otherwise. The exchange claims this abrupt policy shift was made
behind closed doors, bypassing the legislative process, and unfairly
targets only Oregon residents. Coinbase's lawsuit comes as federal
lawmakers move toward formal crypto legislation, including the GENIUS
and Clarity bills expected to reach President Trump's desk later this
month. 

 PUMP.FUN TOKEN SALE SELLS OUT IN 12 MINUTES, RAISING $448.5M (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pump.fun's ICO hit its $4B FDV cap instantly, with 10,260 buyers
scooping up $448.5M worth of PUMP in just 12 minutes. Nearly 24,000
wallets KYC'd for the sale, highlighting massive demand for one of
Solana's biggest token launches. Tokens will be distributed within 72
hours, initially non-transferable.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 REVOLUT TAPS MORPHO TO POWER DEFI YIELD FOR MILLIONS OF USERS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Revolut has selected Morpho as its DeFi backend, marking a major step
toward bringing Ethereum-native yield products to its global user
base. The British fintech, celebrating its 10th anniversary, will
offer Morpho-powered crypto savings features as a modern alternative
to traditional bank accounts. The move also hints at a broader trend
of major fintechs bootstrapping through existing EVM deployments
before launching their own L2 infrastructure. 

 ZCASH 2.0 & PROJECT TACHYON (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bitcoin's pseudonymity has failed to provide true privacy, while
centralized structures like ETFs enable wealth seizure, and
transparent balances expose users to physical attacks, creating demand
for genuinely private money. Zcash uses zero-knowledge technology with
end-to-end encryption to achieve real privacy, but current ZK systems
face severe scalability limitations from state contention and wallets
needing to download all transactions. Project Tachyon, led by ZK
engineer Sean Bowe, aims to solve these scalability issues within 12
months, potentially creating the world's first private money at
planetary scale.

 STABLECOINS DRIVE 30% MOM GROWTH, ATTRACT 2X MORE CUSTOMERS (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Stripe reports that stablecoin payments are growing 30%
month-over-month and that customers who pay with stables are twice as
likely to be net new. While existing customers may stick to cards,
stables unlock demand from users who previously couldn't transact,
particularly in regions with limited access to global banking. It's a
win-win: merchants expand reach, and underserved users gain access. 

 HOW TO BECOME A CRYPTO INTERN (45 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto "interns" are actually social media and community managers
with skills in writing, psychology, content creation, and deep
industry knowledge to succeed in these highly sought-after roles.
Applicants should emphasize quality over quantity in job applications,
build knowledge through specific books and active crypto
participation, and simplify complex concepts for audiences. Key career
growth strategies include taking ownership beyond your core role,
becoming irreplaceable by filling critical gaps, solving problems
proactively rather than just identifying them, and building trust
through clear communication and reliable execution.

 BITCOIN VS. THE IMF (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 BitMEX lays out a powerful case for Bitcoin as an alternative to
IMF-style financial dependency, tracing the Fund's history of coercive
lending and contrasting it with Bitcoin's potential to restore
national sovereignty. While the IMF continues to impose restrictive
conditions—as seen in its 319 Bitcoin-obsessed mentions in El
Salvador's 2025 loan reports—countries like Bhutan have sidestepped
IMF reliance entirely by using surplus hydropower to mine 11,611 BTC,
now worth 42% of its GDP. Bitcoin is not just a reserve asset, but a
geopolitical tool that enables smaller nations to invest in
infrastructure and avoid the “Jackals” of legacy finance. If
adoption grows, Bhutan and other resource-rich nations could emerge as
strategic winners in a post-IMF world. 

 CONVERGENCE TRADE: THE PUMP TRADE YOU NEVER HEARD ABOUT (9 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The $PUMP convergence trade exploited a 10% price spread between
Binance and HyperLiquid perps by going long on Binance while shorting
on HyperLiquid, capturing both the premium convergence and massive
funding rate differentials. This delta-neutral strategy yielded 13-18%
returns in just 2 days when prices converged at $0.0068, though it
required careful margin management due to HyperLiquid's isolated
margin requirements and potential premium expansion risks. The
opportunity exists because both exchanges compete to be the primary
quote venue for new assets with separate pre-markets that don't
reference each other, creating inefficiencies that persist until spot
trading enables easier arbitrage.
