MINUTE READ) [4]

value-added tax, improving its appeal as a crypto-friendly

 EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON WHAT A TRUMP OR HARRIS PRESIDENCY COULD MEAN FOR
THE CRYPTO INDUSTRY (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The upcoming presidential election presents conflicting approaches to
crypto, with Trump adopting a pro-crypto stance and Harris being more
cautious. Industry experts generally agree crypto will be fine
regardless of the outcome, but a Trump presidency might be more
immediately positive due to more transparent policy positions and
promises. The election's primary impact will be in alleviating
regulatory uncertainty, though the candidates' approaches differ in
speed and size.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO LAUNCH A HYPED, LEGIT TOKEN, FROM THE CEO OF COINLIST (1
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To launch a hyped token, the community needs to feel like insiders,
which can be accomplished through a discounted community round, and
everyone else should have a fair launch price. Make the VC vesting and
insider holdings transparent with clear rules about what is and is not
allowed. Though some level of vesting is valuable for ensuring
long-term alignment, it also promotes low float, high FDV tokens that
slowly sink from continuous unlocks. 

 PROGRESSIVE'S DREAM: PANTERA BLOCKCHAIN LETTER SEPTEMBER 2024 (15
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This letter argues that Bitcoin aligns with the progressive ideals of
financial inclusion despite opposition from some politicians. There
have been recent endorsements of blockchain from politicians in both
parties, signaling the positive impact of lobbying and optimism about
the future of blockchain regulation in the United States. The letter
also covers debates on DePIN networks, with proponents highlighting
its potential for capital-efficient infrastructure development and
skeptics cautioning about high monitoring and capital costs. Finally,
the letter explores the pros and cons of appchains, weighing the
benefits of ecosystem integration against greater control over
tokenomics, MEV, and blockspace.

 EIGENLAYER 'ERRONEOUSLY TRANSFERRED' $5.5 MILLION WORTH OF TOKENS TO
ATTACKER (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 EigenLayer accidentally sent $5.5 million worth of tokens to an
attacker, who promptly sold them, after its recent token launch.

agreement, but in reality, a malicious actor was able to convince the
EigenLayer team they should receive an initial allocation. 

 CRYPTO AND TRADFI CONTINUE TO MERGE (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Tradfi and crypto sectors continue to integrate, with companies like
Gnosis Pay moving into Tradfi while platforms like PayPal and Revolut
are launching their own stablecoins. These recent developments suggest
the industries are beginning to combine, offering the best of both
sectors with innovations like direct stablecoin transactions,
under-collateralized loans, and tokenized assets serving as loan
collateral.
