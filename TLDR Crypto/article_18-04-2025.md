 SWEEPING DOJ MEMO SIGNALS TURNING POINT (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A new memo from the DOJ signals a shift away from prosecuting crypto
intermediaries, narrowing enforcement to clear cases of fraud or
national security risk and potentially leading to the closure or
dismissal of ongoing investigations launched under the Biden
administration. While industry advocates see this as a relief, critics
warn it may weaken oversight and embolden misconduct, with civil
agencies like the SEC and CFTC also adjusting their approach in
response.

offering joins a surge of digital asset ETF filings timed around the
new pro-crypto administration and SEC overhaul.

milestone brings verifiable trust to decentralized services, with
major partners like LayerZero and Infura integrating slashing to
enforce service-level guarantees and increase reliability across
blockchain infrastructure.

 ARBITRUM INTRODUCES TIMEBOOST (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Timeboost is a new optional transaction ordering system for Arbitrum
chains that uses sealed-bid auctions to allocate short-term “express
lane” privileges, allowing high-value transactions to bypass delays
while preserving fast block times and privacy for all users. It helps
chain owners capture some MEV revenue and reduces spam while
protecting users from harmful MEV like front-running 

 VERIFIABLE AGENTS AND THE COMING WAVE OF UNSTOPPABLE AI (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Verifiable AI agents tackle both AI's trust problem and crypto's app
problem by combining blockchain verifiability with domain-specific
intelligence. OpenLedger trains specialized language models on
high-quality, sector-focused data and uses Proof of Attribution to
trace how individual data points influence outputs and detect bias. By
layering this model-level verification with onchain execution checks
from EigenLayer, agents become fully auditable from reasoning to
execution.
