truly drives its progress? It's the people. AND THEY STAY BECAUSE THE
CULTURE [6] UNLOCKS THEIR SUCCESS.

 	* appreciate TLDRs
 	* thrive alongside HIGH CALIBER COLLEAGUES [7]
 	* are eager to build the never-been-built
 	* and are inspired by Coinbase's mission to increase global economic
freedom

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SHOPIFY PARTNERS WITH COINBASE AND STRIPE IN LANDMARK STABLECOIN DEAL
(6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Shopify will natively support USDC payments later this year by
integrating a custom payments protocol built with Coinbase on its Base
blockchain and partnering with Stripe, making it the first major
e-commerce platform to offer opt-out stablecoin checkout for merchants
in the U.S. and Europe. The system handles retail-specific
flows—chargebacks, refunds, etc.—and offers merchants up to 0.5%
cashback on USDC transactions, with customer rewards to follow. Unlike
prior opt-in third-party plug-ins, this deep, built-in integration
reflects Shopify's strategic embrace of crypto, aligning with CEO
Tobias Lütke's vision and Coinbase board ties. Industry watchers
predict it will catalyze broader stablecoin adoption and push other
payment processors to follow suit. 

 COINBASE TO INTEGRATE BASE DEXS, EVERY TRADABLE ASSET ON ITS MAIN APP
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Coinbase will embed Base's top decentralized exchanges directly into
its main app, with plans to roll out integrations for other chains
like Ethereum and Solana. It will begin with Aerodrome, which handles
over half of Base's ~$5 billion weekly volume. Any asset tradable on
Aerodrome will be made available for over 100 million Coinbase Retail
App users.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 MORPHO V2 (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Morpho's Markets V2 is a peer-to-peer marketplace for fixed-rate,
fixed-term loans with open bidding, bespoke collateral options,
onchain KYC, and cross-chain settlement. Vaults V2 will offer flexible
yield vaults with instant liquidity and variable-rate returns across
any protocol. This intent-based design delivers market-driven pricing
and multi-collateral flexibility, meeting institutional demands for
predictable, customizable loan terms while avoiding liquidity
fragmentation. By combining fixed-rate direct lending with
variable-rate vaults, Morpho V2 aims to unlock trillions in onchain
credit and complement Morpho V1's existing infrastructure. 

 COINBASE TO LAUNCH BITCOIN REWARDS CARD WITH AMEX (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Coinbase is partnering with American Express to launch the Coinbase
One Card this fall, offering up to 4% bitcoin cashback on purchases,
boosted USDC rewards, and enhanced staking and transaction credits on
its Base L2 network. This follows a broader trend among crypto
platforms, including MetaMask and Kraken, which are issuing payment
cards to bridge digital assets and everyday spending. At its State of
Crypto Summit, Coinbase also signaled plans to bring perpetual futures
trading to U.S. customers by working with the CFTC on
“perpetual-style” futures contracts.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AI X CRYPTO CROSSOVERS (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 As AI systems reshape how we work, learn, and transact, crypto offers
decentralized infrastructure to balance ownership, transparency, and
composability. From persistent identity and portable agent credentials
to decentralized compute, privacy-preserving ads, and onchain
micropayments, crypto enables more open, user-owned AI ecosystems.
This crossover overlaps both infrastructure (e.g., DePIN, agent
marketplaces, and proof-of-personhood) and user experience (AI
companions, registry-based IP, and smarter monetization), with
blockchain tools offering the rails for trust, coordination, and value
alignment in an increasingly AI-mediated world. 

 POLYGON ROADMAP TO 100K TPS (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Polygon's Gigagas roadmap outlines a phased scaling path from 1,000
TPS and ~5 second finality in July to 5,000+ TPS with single-block
instant confirmations and AggLayer cross-chain liquidity by year-end,
before targeting a 100,000 TPS “gigagas” throughput in 2026 and
beyond. Key upgrades include gas-fee stabilization, smart account
features, stateless block validation, validator-elected block
production, and zero reorgs to ensure predictable, low-cost
transactions for high-frequency stablecoin payments and real-world
assets. With deep institutional integration and high USDC and USDT
usage, Polygon is positioning itself as the universal layer for global
payments and RWA settlement.

 US STABLECOIN MARKET COULD EXCEED $2 TRILLION PROJECTION BY END OF
2028 (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin market could surpass $2 trillion by
2028 if legislation like the GENIUS Act passes. The bill, which
advanced in the Senate this week, mandates full backing by U.S.
treasuries, annual audits for large issuers, and clarity on foreign
participation, aiming to reinforce the dollar's global dominance.
Backed by President Trump, the Act is catalyzing rapid movement in the
sector, with major banks preparing launches and Circle's recent IPO
signaling renewed institutional momentum. 

 SPOT ETHEREUM ETFS PULL IN $240 MILLION, BEATING BITCOIN'S ETFS' $164
MILLION (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Spot Ethereum ETFs saw $240M in net inflows Wednesday, beating
Bitcoin ETFs' $164M and extending ETH's inflow streak to 18 days.
Analysts credit the surge to SEC support for DeFi, growing
institutional ETH demand, and bullish spillover from BTC. Ethereum
also led in derivatives volume at $106B and continues gaining momentum
post-Pectra upgrade, positioning it as a key bet for crypto-forward
investors.
