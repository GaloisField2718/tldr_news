MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN TOPS $111K, ETH LEADING RALLY (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin surged to $111,400 on Wednesday, breaking above the $110,000
resistance level that had capped gains for weeks and approaching its
May 22 record of $112,000, with some exchanges showing new all-time
highs while major aggregators indicate BTC remained just below its
peak. The move triggered $425 million in liquidated short positions
and lifted the broader crypto market, with Ethereum jumping 6% to
$2,760 and crypto equities like MicroStrategy and Coinbase gaining
4-6%. Analysts noted that declining volatility historically precedes
major upward moves. Institutional interest in ETH continues to grow
due to its role in tokenization and settlement infrastructure. 

 RIPPLE TAPS BNY MELLON TO CUSTODY RLUSD RESERVES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ripple has appointed BNY Mellon as the primary custodian for RLUSD
reserves, reinforcing its push to scale institutional stablecoin
adoption. RLUSD, issued under a NYDFS Trust Charter, is designed for
enterprise use in cross-border payments and is backed 1:1 with
high-quality liquid assets. BNY will also provide Ripple with
transaction banking services, signaling deepening ties between
traditional finance and regulated digital asset infrastructure.

 PUMP.FUN ANNOUNCES TOKEN SALE (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Pump.fun is launching its native token, $PUMP, through an ICO on July
12 at $0.004 per token, with ambitious plans to "kill Facebook,
TikTok, and Twitch" by creating a social streaming platform. The ICO
will sell 33% of the 1 trillion token supply, with all tokens fully
unlocked on day one. Remaining tokens will be allocated to the
community (24%), the team (20%), investors (13%), and other
initiatives. The public sale requires KYC through partner exchanges
and excludes US/UK residents. Tokens will become transferable 48-72
hours after the sale ends. There will be an airdrop some time after
the initial sale. 

 PRIVY TO POWER MULTICHAIN AI AGENTS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blueprint is partnering with Privy to launch AI agents that manage
assets across EVM, Solana, and Sui chains. This will help automate
onchain activity through session signers and delegated transactions.
Users can onboard with just an email, with Privy handling seamless
identity and transaction flow behind the scenes.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE STATE OF CRYPTO VC (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto VC faces a challenging environment with lower returns to LPs
resulting in tougher fundraising conditions, though 2025 capital
deployment remains on pace with 2024 despite slower deal counts, and
improving M&A activity (NinjaTrader, Privy, and Bridge acquisitions)
signals better exit opportunities. Three major shifts are emerging:
tokens replacing dual token/equity structures as the primary
investment mechanism, fintech VCs converging with crypto VCs as
payment rails move onchain, and the rise of "liquid venture" where
funds invest in public tokens with VC-like return profiles. Despite
challenges, crypto remains at the frontier of venture innovation with
its blend of public/private markets and hyper-power law outcomes,
positioning it to continue attracting capital seeking asymmetric
returns as more assets move onchain. 

 THE SUNK COST CAGE (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 “Sunk Cost Cage” refers to the modern sunk cost fallacy in
crypto, where past investments keep individuals trapped in diminishing
pursuits. Recent institutional moves, like $49 billion into BTC ETFs,
$4.3 billion into ETH ETFs, and Robinhood's EVM chain on Arbitrum with
perpetual swaps, illustrate crypto's evolution into mainstream
finance. Participants split into four camps based on belief in BTC and
broader crypto, making honest self-assessment vital for deciding
whether to specialize or plan an exit. Escaping the cage demands
admitting past efforts may no longer justify continued commitment and
embracing broader opportunities.

 THE DEFI MULLET: HOW ETHEREUM WILL POWER FINTECH AT SCALE (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The “DeFi Mullet” (fintech apps in front, Ethereum DeFi
infrastructure in back) offers users the sleek UI they're used to with
the benefits of permissionless finance. Ethereum enables faster
integrations, real-time transparency, and immutable infrastructure for
fintechs building financial products without legacy constraints.
Coinbase's crypto-backed loans via Morpho are the first large-scale
proof point, with $860M in collateral and 9,100 borrowers. As open
finance stacks mature, the next wave of consumer-facing apps will be
powered by Ethereum under the hood. 

 CRYPTO VC BARBELL: TRADFI-PROVEN FOUNDERS VS. DEGEN-NATIVE BUILDERS
(2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto VC is polarizing around two extremes: tokenization/stablecoin
startups led by ex-Stripe, PayPal, and Meta founders fluent in fintech
scale and regulation, and high-velocity, onchain-native degen apps
like prediction markets and tap trading. The former appeals to TradFi
VCs but requires deep payment infrastructure insight, while the latter
thrives on cultural intuition and can generate sustainable revenue
without token dependence.
