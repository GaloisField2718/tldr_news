 KAIN ON TOKEN DISTRIBUTIONS AND INFINEX (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post discusses the difficulties of distributing tokens in
crypto, specifically focusing on the issues of different distribution
methods (points, airdrops, etc.) and the regulatory hurdles that come

sold based on early participation on a platform/protocol to fairly

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TACTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CRYPTO INFLECTION POINTS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto market conditions are more sophisticated than "bull/bear
markets". A more sophisticated approach that acknowledges the
complexity of crypto's high volatility and varied investment
timeframes is needed. Investing success comes from navigating market
inflection points and adapting strategies based on evolving
conditions, rather than sticking to standard bull/bear market
positions. 

 L2S VS. CENTRALIZED AWS SERVERS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 L2s (Layer 2 solutions) inherit the security properties of Ethereum,
addressing concerns about their similarity to centralized servers.
They achieve re-org resistance, censorship resistance, data
availability, and transaction validity by posting data batches to
Ethereum, ensuring that any malicious attempts would require
compromising Ethereum itself.
