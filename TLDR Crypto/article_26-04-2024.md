MARKETS & BUSINESS

 AFTER 6-YEAR HIATUS, STRIPE TO START TAKING CRYPTO PAYMENTS, STARTING
WITH USDC STABLECOIN (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Stripe has announced it will allow customers to accept cryptocurrency
payments on its platform. It will start this Summer with USDC on
Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon, showing a demo of crypto payments using
Solana at their developer conference. Stripe previously supported
Bitcoin in 2014 but halted crypto efforts in 2018, citing its use as a
store of value instead of as a medium of exchange. It processed $1
trillion in payments in 2023. 

 CONSENSYS SUES SEC (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Consensys is suing the SEC to restrain the SEC's attempts to expand
its jurisdiction over crypto regulation and defend the Ethereum
blockchain and its community of developers and users. Consensys argues
that the SEC's current approach is creating unnecessary confusion and
disruption for those invested in the future and development of
Ethereum and related decentralized technologies.

 VISA ONCHAIN ANALYTICS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Visa's Head of Crypto, Cuy Sheffield, recently announced the launch
of Visa's Onchain Analytics Dashboard. The dashboard tracks public
stablecoin data like supply, monthly active users, and transaction
volume of major stablecoins across 5 L1s and 4 L2s. It shows that the
adjusted onchain stablecoin volume for the past 30 days was $265
billion. Visa is looking for community feedback to make the tool
better. 

 INTRODUCING ETHEREUM BLOBSPACE DERIVATIVES (26 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethereum's recently introduced Blobs have drastically reduced data
availability costs for rollups but have volatile price movements that
make future costs unpredictable. Blobspace derivatives offer an
opportunity for rollups to hedge against future price changes and
de-risk operational costs. Outstanding issues include physical
delivery, protecting against market manipulation, and creating a
proper seller incentive structure.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AN ASSORTMENT OF RANDOM THOUGHTS ON THE MARKET (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The hype behind Runes and memecoins has died down, indicating a
potential buying opportunity. Similarly, airdrop farming has become
far less popular, and the fragmentation of the market's ecosystems
makes it hard for people to keep up with everything happening. For
investors with lots of capital, finding a few high-conviction plays
and waiting for the long term is valuable, while lower-capital
portfolios are still best off farming airdrops. 

 WHY CONSUMER CRYPTO APPS WILL VERTICALLY INTEGRATE (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Consumer-facing crypto apps with strong brands and large user bases
are well-positioned to vertically integrate by launching their own
application-specific blockchains, as they can provide better user
experiences and capture more value compared to building on general
purpose infrastructure. The current market favors crypto projects with
clear narratives and product-market fit over broad infrastructure
plays, many of which have struggled to gain traction.

 WHY MANY ‚ÄòZOMBIE BLOCKCHAINS' ARE STILL WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
(7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Forbes has defined a list of 20 zombie blockchains with over a
billion dollars in market capitalization but little utility or user
activity. This phenomenon can be attributed to the intangible
qualities of these networks, their longevity in surviving multiple
cycles, and the presence of loyal supporters promoting them. Some
investors value these chains for factors beyond utility, similar to
how fashion brands derive value from social status or storytelling. 

 MEMECOINS ARE DESTROYING CRYPTO (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The rise of meme coins in the crypto space has sparked concerns about
their negative impact on the industry's credibility and long-term
growth. Critics argue that these tokens, which often lack technical
innovation and rely on hype-driven speculation, create a predatory
environment that disproportionately benefits savvy traders at the
expense of less experienced investors.
