 EXPLAINING FUNDING RATES (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Perpetual swap funding rates act as a tool that aligns contract
prices with market prices. Market sentiment has recently become
bullish, indicated by record-high funding rates of 19%+ on major
cryptocurrencies and 30%+ on alternatives. The surge shows market
participants are confidently going long, which shows optimism from
traders. Now is a time to exercise caution as the market tends to test
and flush leverage. 

 THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERGENCE IN TRADING (11 MINUTE READ) [10]

Divergences - situations when two things diverge from one another -
can form the basis of many robust trade ideas. The post illustrates
this principle using different variables like price and momentum,
price and delta, price and premium, price and sentiment, price and
news, and relative strength.

 STATE OF WALLETS PART 1: WALLET TECHNOLOGIES (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article provides a good overview of the crypto wallet sector,
focusing on three categories: self-custody wallets, embedded wallets
(Wallet-as-a-Service), and smart accounts. The evolution from
primarily self-custody wallets is paving the way for more
user-friendly options that could significantly increase mainstream
crypto adoption. The piece raises intriguing questions around the
paths of adoption, user types, geographical influence, business
models, and wallet form factors that might take shape as the crypto
ecosystem evolves. 

 HOW YOU GET FARMED: A RANT (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Critics of the points farming strategy that has been employed by many
protocols lately say that protocols are basically farming users rather
than the other way around. These platforms incentivize farmers, with
farmers often ending up being exploited. In light of this, users
should be diligent in researching tokenless protocols, engaging with
team members, and not blindly trusting influencers shilling ways to
farm the protocol.
