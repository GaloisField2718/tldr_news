LAW (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 South Korean crypto exchanges Upbit and Bithumb will compensate
investors $2.5M following service outages caused by a surge in user
activity during the December 3 martial law declaration, which
temporarily dropped Bitcoin's price by 32%. The incident has prompted
financial regulators to enforce measures like server expansions and
emergency response improvements to prevent future disruptions. 

 HARRY JUNG SELECTED TO LEAD CFTC'S ENGAGEMENT ON CRYPTO UNDER TRUMP'S
INTERIM CHIEF PHAM (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham has appointed Harry Jung as Acting
Chief of Staff to lead the agency's crypto and digital asset
engagement following Pham's leadership changes after being tapped by
President Trump as interim Chair. Pham, known for her digital asset
initiatives, has yet to be replaced permanently. Former Commissioner

 DOGECOIN ETF REGISTERED AS ELON MUSK'S D.O.G.E GAINS TRACTION (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bitwise has initiated the registration process for a Dogecoin ETF in
Delaware, joining Rex Shares and Osprey Funds in pursuing
memecoin-focused investment products amid growing institutional
interest. The development comes as Dogecoin's market cap reaches $52
billion, having tripled over the past year, partially due to its
unofficial association with Elon Musk's newly-formed Department of
Government Efficiency (DOGE).

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHEREALIZE: AN INSTITUTIONAL MARKETING AND PRODUCT ARM FOR THE
ETHEREUM ECOSYSTEM (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Etherealize aims to accelerate institutional adoption of Ethereum and
is a response to criticisms about the lack of ecosystem support from
the Ethereum Foundation. It plans to curate a content hub for
traditional finance education, institutional-grade products for asset
tokenization, and advocacy efforts for both corporate and policy
adoption. The organization positions itself as complementary to the
Ethereum Foundation's work while focusing specifically on bringing
institutional players to the network in 2025 through its dashboard
platform and product suite. 

 MESTA BUILDING GLOBAL PAYMENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mesta is revolutionizing global payments by combining fiat and
blockchain rails to enable fast, low-cost cross-border transactions.
It is currently processing millions across 50 currencies while
building modern infrastructure to replace outdated systems like
COBOL-based banking.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BRIDGING WEB2 AND WEB3: HOW DEFAI EMPOWERS AI AGENTS FOR FINANCIAL
TRANSACTIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DeFAI frameworks bridge Web2 agents with blockchain tech, enabling
AI-driven complex financial transactions. Blockchain provides agents
with instant settlement, lower compliance burdens, and guardrails
around sensitive and complex onchain interactions. Use cases include
automated invoicing and treasury management to smart escrows and real
estate transactions. 

 THE 5 LEVELS OF AGENTIC TRUST (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This framework proposes levels of trust for AI agents that progress
from current opaque systems to fully autonomous agents. Today's
trust-based systems offer no guarantees to the end user about the
agent's legitimacy, while the next level â€“ verifiable agents using
TEEs and zero-knowledge proofs â€“ starts to tackle how we can
guarantee agent outcomes are authentic. The later stages include
real-world agents that validate data sources and ultimately autonomous
agents that can operate without human intervention.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MEMECOINS, TRUMP, AND SECURITIES LAW: WHY THE RULES HAVEN'T CHANGED
(10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Memecoins have become a surprising safe haven from securities laws
due to their speculative nature and lack of underlying value, making
them unlikely to qualify as securities under the Howey Test.
Meanwhile, even President Trump's DeFi token project follows
securities law compliance, proving that while legal structures may
look convoluted, the rules remain the same. Offshore setups still
offer significant tax and governance advantages. 

 DIFFERENT CYCLE, DIFFERENT RISKS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Market anxiety has continued, despite Bitcoin's rise to $101k and
promising tailwinds like new U.S. crypto regulations and ETFs, due to
altcoin underperformance and lingering PTSD from past collapses like
LUNA and FTX. However, the current cycle is fundamentally different,
with reduced systemic leverage and clearer boundaries between
speculative and mature market segments, offering a healthier
foundation for growth despite ongoing risks.
