MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CIRCLE PRICES IPO AT $31 PER SHARE, VALUATION AT $6.9 BILLION (5
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Circle priced its NYSE IPO at $31 per share, above the original
$24–$26 range, selling roughly 34 million shares to raise $1.1
billion and achieve a $6.9 billion valuation. The stablecoin issuer,
known for USDC, will begin trading under the ticker “CRCL” on
Thursday, marking the second major crypto IPO under the Trump
administration. Circle's public debut provides access to deeper
capital markets and heightened regulatory scrutiny amid legislative
momentum for clearer stablecoin rules. This offer follows an aborted
SPAC attempt in 2021. 

 JPMORGAN TO ACCEPT CRYPTO ETFS AS COLLATERAL FOR LOANS (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 JPMorgan will allow clients to use crypto exchange-traded funds as
collateral for loans beginning with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust.
The bank will also include crypto holdings when calculating client net
worth, treating digital assets similarly to traditional ones in
determining borrowing capacity. This initiative aligns with broader
industry shifts after the Federal Reserve lifted guidance discouraging
bank crypto activities and the OCC clarified that banks can custody
customer crypto assets.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 LEVEL: ONCHAIN BANKING PROTOCOL (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Level has built an onchain banking protocol that aggregates USDC and
USDT deposits, allocates them to low-risk lending strategies, and
issues a single fungible stablecoin, lvlUSD, backed by the pooled
receipt tokens. By accepting both native stablecoins and existing
receipt tokens, Level solves fragmentation in DeFi lending and expands
the on-chain money supply through transparent, programmable
fractional-reserve operations. All reserve allocations and lending
positions are fully onchain and auditable, combining the productivity
of fractional-reserve banking with DeFi's transparency. 

 SIDEBAR: COINBASE'S FOUR-STEP PLAN FOR AFRICAN BUILDERS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Coinbase's new West Africa lead, Damilare Aregbesola, is rolling out
a four-part Base Batch program aimed at helping African builders go
beyond hackathons with sustained access to funding, mentorship, and
global exposure. The initiative includes workshops, a buildathon, a
world-class incubator, and a global demo day offering up to $1M in
funding. Aregbesola highlights stablecoins as the most impactful
blockchain use case in Africa today, urging builders to focus on
solving core financial challenges before chasing newer trends.

 UNDERSTANDING FLUID: A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW (45 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Fluid's Liquidity Layer unifies onchain capital by pooling deposits
into multisided lending, vault, and DEX protocols, allowing users to
earn yield while enabling overcollateralized borrowing and efficient
asset swaps. Its Vault protocol's range-based liquidation engine
supports up to 95% LTV with minimal penalties, and its “Smart
Collateral” and “Smart Debt” primitives let collateral and debt
positions double as DEX liquidity, driving over $10 billion in
USDC–USDT volume. Since rebranding from Instadapp in late 2024,
Fluid has grown to nearly $2 billion in deposited collateral and
surpassed $46 billion in DEX trading volume across Ethereum and its
Layer 2s, all governed by FLUID tokenholders. Upcoming upgrades
include a modular, gas-efficient DEX V2 and a Solana launch via
Jupiter Lend.

creators. Be opinionated, human, and experimental. Make sure you
recycle strong ideas, don't overuse AI, and build a recognizable
voice. Most importantly prioritize authenticity and positivity.
