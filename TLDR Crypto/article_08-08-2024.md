 UK REGULATOR FCA HAS ISSUED OVER 1K WARNINGS TO CRYPTO FIRMS SINCE
OCTOBER (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Since new financial promotion rules took effect in October, the UK's
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued over 1,000 warnings to
crypto firms, leading to the removal of 48 apps from U.K. app stores.
The FCA continues to crack down on unregistered crypto companies
illegally promoting to the U.K. market while also providing guidance
to ensure firms properly categorize their customers.

potential further declines. While some traders anticipate more
downside, others see this as a buying opportunity, with expectations
of a possible near-term recovery.

BACKING ASSET (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ethena Labs expanded its synthetic dollar protocol, Ethena, to Solana

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHY ETHEREUM FEES WERE DOWN $679M IN Q2 (57%) (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethereum's fees dropped by 57% in Q2 after the EIP-4844 upgrade,
which increased block space and reduced costs, boosting L2
scalability. While this might look like a financial dip, it's actually
a positive sign â€” L2 transactions and users have surged, showing
Ethereum's network is scaling and improving. 

 PERFORMANCE OF TOKENS LISTED ON BINANCE YTD (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Since the start of 2024, Binance has listed 30 new tokens, but the

reflecting broader market challenges or specific issues within the
projects.

 THE RACE TO DOMINATE STABLECOINS (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stablecoins could transform global finance by challenging banks and
payment networks. As competition among issuers, banks, and tech
companies intensifies, the race to dominate this new "operating system
for money" could reshape the future of finance, with regulators
playing a key role in determining the market's outcome. The likely
result is a market with multiple stablecoins offering faster, cheaper
payments, benefiting consumers but potentially sidelining current
issuers. 

 THOUGHTS ON JUMP SUPPOSEDLY LEAVING CRYPTO (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Jump Crypto might be exiting its "building" ventures, where it
invested in crypto projects in exchange for token allocations,
following a series of setbacks like Luna, Wormhole, and FTX. However,
its core trading operations likely remain active and profitable, with
recent wallet activity suggesting it is offloading its crypto holdings
as it scales back its involvement in the space.
