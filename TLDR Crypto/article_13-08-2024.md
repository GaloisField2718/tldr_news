traditionally slow for practical use. Despite these challenges,
advancements in FHE schemes such as BGV, BFV, CKKS, and CGGI â€” each
tailored to different types of arithmetic â€” are pushing the
boundaries of its usability, with innovations in hardware
acceleration, scheme-switching, and bootstrapping making FHE more
feasible for real-world applications.
