MARKETS & BUSINESS

 STABLECOINS BEYOND THE DOLLAR (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Crypto is overly dependent on USD-pegged stablecoins, which account
for 99% of the market. Local currency-pegged stablecoins, such as the
euro, yen, or naira, unlock meaningful everyday use cases like
payments, borrowing, and lending in familiar currencies. Base
processed $1.5T in stablecoin volume last month and already hosts 12
local stablecoins, with new SGD and AUD tokens launched this week,
while also testing its upcoming “super app” focused on payments,
social, and creator monetization. 

 PERP DEXS SMASH $1T MONTHLY VOLUME (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Perpetual trading protocols crossed $1.05T in September volume, up
48% from August, marking the first time the sector has hit the
trillion-dollar mark. Aster, newly rebranded and backed by CZ, had
$420B in activity, overtaking long-time leader Hyperliquid at $282.5B,
while Ethereum L2-based Lighter followed with $164.4B in private beta.
With Lighter's mainnet now live and Aster's rapid token-fueled
momentum, competition in the perp DEX market is heating up quickly.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 THE $NOCK THESIS (20 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nockchain represents "Bitcoin, but better" as a scalable L1
purpose-built for zero-knowledge proofs using a UTXO transaction model
that supports arbitrary intents, where 100% of $NOCK supply is
distributed to miners who generate ZKPs proving correct transaction
execution via the highly performant NockVM. The platform's
differentiator is its zkPoW flywheel, where $NOCK incentivizes miners
to optimize the NockVM prover, making ZKPs cheaper and faster, which
expands NockApp margins and unlocks new use cases, driving increased
demand for $NOCK and repeating the cycle. Near-term catalysts for
repricing to $0.20 by year-end include deployment of an EVM bridge to
Base with $1M+ Aerodrome liquidity seeding, an upcoming halvening
reducing miner sell pressure from 32.7k to 16.3k $NOCK per block,
October's programmability upgrade introducing transaction format
improvements, and growing ecosystem signals across developers, miners,
community, and traders, with long-term $1.00 target dependent on
mining network growth and institutional credibility through mining
partnerships. 

 AVALANCHE TREASURY CO. GOES PUBLIC VIA $675M SPAC (3 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Avalanche Treasury Co. (AVAT) announced a $675M SPAC merger with
Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp., including $460M in projected treasury
assets and a $200M discounted AVAX purchase allocation. The company
aims to grow its AVAX holdings beyond $1B and become a leading public
vehicle for institutional exposure, with capital also directed toward
protocol investments, partnerships, and validator infrastructure.
Backed by firms like Dragonfly, VanEck, and Galaxy Digital, AVAT will
trade on Nasdaq in early 2026 and launch at a 23% discount to direct
AVAX exposure, with Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer joining as a
strategic advisor.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 7 DEADLY SINS OF TOKENOMICS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Overinflated fully diluted valuations at launch that create immediate
downside risk and discourage organic entry, low-float traps with tiny
circulating supply creating artificial scarcity that pumps early but
crashes when steep unlocks begin, and insider-dominated allocations
exceeding 60% to VCs and teams with weak lockups that prioritize
extraction over community alignment. Additional failures include
utility theater, where tokens serve only governance or inflationary
staking without real demand sinks, emissions without corresponding
burn mechanisms that reward mercenary farmers who dump immediately,
liquidity starvation through inadequate market-making and shallow
pools that prevent scalable trading, and narrative disconnection where
tokenomics don't align with product models or ecosystem narratives.
These design flaws create predictable failure patterns, including
retail exit liquidity scenarios, unsustainable hype cycles followed by
sharp crashes, perpetual sell pressure from misaligned insiders,
speculative churn without structural demand, TVL death spirals when
rewards fade, high slippage preventing institutional participation,
and token irrelevance due to lack of coherence between narrative,
product, and token mechanics. 

 STABLECOINS 2030: WEB3 TO WALL STREET (45 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Citi has revised its 2030 stablecoin issuance forecasts upward to
$1.9 trillion base case and $4 trillion bull case, driven by 40%
year-to-date growth, regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act, and
accelerating institutional adoption following what the bank calls
blockchain's "ChatGPT moment." The growth drivers include partial
reallocation of USD bank deposits and offshore holdings, continued
crypto market expansion, and substitution of physical banknotes, with
stablecoins potentially supporting $100 trillion in transaction
activity by 2030 at 50x velocity similar to traditional payment rails.
Citi expects bank tokens like tokenized deposits to potentially exceed
stablecoin transaction volumes, reaching $100-140 trillion annually if
just 5% of global large-value payments migrate onchain, as multiple
digital money formats will coexist rather than compete in a "format
war." Challenges include fragmentation and interoperability issues,
privacy concerns on public blockchains, scalability limitations for
large-value transactions, and the need for accounting recognition as
cash equivalents. Emerging solutions include zero-knowledge proofs and
the rush by Circle, Stripe, Bitfinex, and others to build specialized
Layer-1 blockchains for payments infrastructure.

 QUITTING TRUMP'S TOP CRYPTO JOB WASN'T EASY (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Bo Hines stepped down as head of Trump's digital assets council on
August 9 after delivering a comprehensive 180-day report positioning
the US as the "crypto capital of the world," feeling confident the
groundwork and regulatory framework were established while clearing
the way for deputy Patrick Witt to lead upcoming legislative battles,
including the digital asset market structure bill. Within days of his
resignation, Hines received over 50 job offers before being appointed
CEO of Tether USA on August 19, where he's overseeing the launch of
USAT, which he claims will be the first federally licensed stablecoin
in the US. The 30-year-old brings nearly a decade of crypto engagement
since age 18 to his current role at Tether, which accounts for over
half of all daily crypto transaction settlements. Hines remains
confident in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve's progress despite no
timeline, praising crypto czar David Sacks' leadership, while
envisioning a future of 24/7 markets, instant settlement, and
tokenized public securities where "everything moves onchain," with
stablecoin market cap potentially exceeding Treasury Secretary
Bessent's trillion-dollar projection as tokenization accelerates
globally. 

 EVERYONE'S WRONG ABOUT STABLECOINS VS VISA (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The comparison between stablecoins and Visa/Mastercard reflects a
fundamental misunderstanding of payment architecture, as these
technologies operate at completely different layers, with stablecoins
competing against ACH and SWIFT settlement infrastructure rather than
payment networks that handle authorization and routing. When you swipe
a credit card, no money moves initially - only data flows through
Visa's messaging network for authorization, while actual settlement
happens days later through traditional banking rails that are slow,
expensive, and operate only during business hours. Stablecoins operate
at the settlement layer where authorization and settlement occur
simultaneously in atomic blockchain transactions, offering 97-99% cost
reduction and 100x faster finality compared to traditional wire
transfers, which is why Visa and Mastercard are integrating
stablecoins into their settlement infrastructure rather than fighting
them. Crypto-native payment products like Base Pay, Solana Pay, and
Coinbase Commerce compete directly with card networks by offering
complete payment solutions with lower merchant fees but sacrifice
consumer protections like chargebacks and dispute resolution that
remain critical for mainstream adoption.
