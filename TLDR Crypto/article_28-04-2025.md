 THIS TECH COMPANY GREW 32,481%...(SPONSOR) [4] 

 No, it's not Nvidia… It's MODE MOBILE, 2023's fastest-growing
software company according to Deloitte.

Just as Uber turned vehicles into income-generating assets, Mode is
TURNING SMARTPHONES INTO THE EASIEST PASSIVE INCOME SOURCE [4],
already helping 45M+ users earn $325M+ through simple, everyday use. 

The technology behind it all is the _EarnPhone_, and it could be the
biggest disruption to smartphones since the iPhone.

Mode has recently secured their Nasdaq stock ticker $MODE, but you can
still invest in their pre-IPO offering before their share price
changes this Thursday.

 SOLANA DEFI PROTOCOL LOOPSCALE HIT WITH $5.8 MILLION EXPLOIT TWO
WEEKS AFTER LAUNCH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Solana-based DeFi protocol Loopscale suffered a $5.8 million exploit
just two weeks after launch due to a flaw in the pricing mechanism of
its RateX-based collateral. The team is collaborating with law
enforcement to investigate the incident and recover funds while
progressively restoring platform functionality following a temporary
suspension of services. 

 BITCOIN TREASURY FIRMS DRIVING $200T HYPERBITCOINIZATION (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Bitcoin-focused treasury firms, including MicroStrategy, are
positioning themselves ahead of global Bitcoin adoption, anticipating
a potential $100–$200 trillion hyperbitcoinization in which Bitcoin
supplants fiat currencies. This trend is being driven by continued
institutional accumulation, evolving regulatory frameworks, and
Bitcoin's price performance outpacing inflation, with firms such as
Metaplanet also aggressively expanding their Bitcoin reserves.

 INTRODUCING FLUID DEX V2 (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Fluid DEX v2 is a complete re-architecture of Fluid's onchain engine.
Built as a single, modular contract atop the Fluid Liquidity Layer to
maximize composability and capital efficiency, it expands on v1's
Smart Collateral and Smart Debt features by introducing four new pool
types, onchain dynamic fees, customizable hooks, and yield-accruing
limit orders. Governance can permissionlessly or conditionally deploy
any AMM model, while liquidity providers (LPs) can combine collateral
and debt range orders to create tailored, leveraged yield strategies. 

 PAYMENTS GIANT STRIPE BUILDING 'NEW STABLECOIN PRODUCT' (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Stripe is developing a stablecoin-based payment product built on
Bridge, the API-driven stablecoin infrastructure it acquired for $1.1
billion in October 2024. The company has begun testing the product
with clients across more than 90 countries, specifically targeting
markets outside the US, EU, and UK—regions where traditional card
networks are less effective and challenges around treasury management,
remittances, and currency stability persist.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BLUE-MONEY GOSPEL (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethereum's missing element is a unifying narrative or "meme" for ETH
itself. Bitcoin leveraged its 21 million supply cap to position itself
as digital gold. Despite Ethereum's world-class settlement
infrastructure and thriving L2 ecosystem, ETH has yet to establish
itself as a true store of value, resulting in fragmented conviction
across protocols. Closing this gap will require the community to view
ETH as more than just gas - like “blue money” to be held, staked,
and promoted as a reserve asset. 

 THE UNCONSTRAINED VS CONSTRAINED VISIONS FOR CRYPTO (7 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Crypto is shaped by two primary philosophical approaches. The
“unconstrained” vision advocates for a complete rebuild of the
financial system with the goal of ultimately replacing traditional
institutions and fiat currencies. By contrast, the “constrained”
vision prioritizes pragmatic integration, focusing on regulatory
alignment, user experience parity, security, and strategic
partnerships to incrementally enhance existing systems and drive
broader adoption.

 RETH'S LATEST VIEW ON EVM OBJECT FORMAT (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Reth team, previously strong advocates of the EVM Object Format
(EOF), now recommends either fully replacing it with EIP-7912 or
proceeding with EOF only if code and gas introspection capabilities
are restored. They argue that recent challenges such as inadequate
testing, the availability of superior L1 optimizations without EVM
modifications, and the emergence of simpler alternatives make
advancing the current EOF proposal a risky decision. 

 TRUMP'S WLFI CRYPTO INVESTMENTS AREN'T PAYING OFF (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 The Trump family's crypto initiative, World Liberty Financial (WLFI),
raised $550 million through token sales and built a portfolio
concentrated in USDC, WBTC, and ETH. However, the project is now
facing significant portfolio losses, particularly in assets such as
MOVE and MNT. Despite ongoing concerns around conflicts of interest
and potential market manipulation, WLFI continues to attract support
from the crypto industry, including a $25 million investment from DWF
Labs to back its stablecoin, USD1.
