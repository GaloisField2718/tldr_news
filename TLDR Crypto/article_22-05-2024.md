MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Donald Trump, aiming for a second term as U.S. President, has
announced that his campaign will now accept cryptocurrency donations,
marking a significant shift from traditional campaign financing.
Supported by Coinbase, his platform now accepts a wide array of
cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various meme coins,
positioning him as the first major party Presidential nominee to
embrace such a diverse range of digital assets for campaign
contributions. 

 UNISWAP RESPONDS TO SEC'S WELLS NOTICE (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Uniswap Labs argues that the protocol fully complies with US law and
that the decentralized exchange does not fall under the ‚Äúsecurities
exchange‚Äù or ‚Äúbroker‚Äù definition. It notes that over 90% of
trading volume is on commodities pairs, stablecoins, or out of the
country, expanding beyond the SEC's jurisdiction. Lawyers for the
Ripple and Grayscale cases are providing outside counsel, and Uniswap
is confident it will win if forced to litigate.

 AIRDROPS: AN ANALYSIS OF OVER 2,000,000 EVENTS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have identified key factors in airdrop design through a
comprehensive analysis of over 2 million airdrop events across 40
protocols, such as the quantity of tokens distributed and the target
recipients. Their findings suggest that airdrops targeted at core
users with smaller token quantities tend to show higher price
stability and engagement post-distribution, challenging the
effectiveness of widespread, larger airdrops. 

 WHY HAVE ALMOST ALL TOKEN LAUNCHES GONE TO SHIT LATELY? (9 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The quality of token launches has declined significantly due to new
stringent exchange requirements demanding high user metrics prior to
listing, which has led projects to focus on generating inflated user
activities through point systems rather than organic growth. This
shift has resulted in an airdrop farming culture where users engage
not out of genuine interest but to earn rewards, leading to rapid
sell-offs post-launch and damaging the overall market dynamics and the
perceived value of new tokens.

 This article discusses the complex financial maneuvers used by major

fiscal issues, and influence global trade dynamics, particularly
