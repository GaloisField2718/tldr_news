 The SEC has postponed its decision on Hashdex's application to
convert its bitcoin futures ETF into a spot ETF and Grayscale's bid to
introduce a new futures-based ether ETF. With no indication of how the

 COLORTRACE: FUNGIBLE TOKEN COLORING AND ATTRIBUTION (30 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 LayerZero has introduced ColorTrace, an algorithm that aims to solve
the "fungible token coloring problem" - keeping track of specific
fungible tokens and their origins. The algorithm aims to keep track of
tokens upon transfer and redemption and reward minters proportionally.
It offers a single-chain and cross-chain token color solution with
"globally consistent" and "economically feasible" token coloring. This
paper discusses potential applications of ColorTrace, such as
stablecoin collateral tracking.

 BLOCKCHAINS AS PLATFORMS: BENEFITS, DRAWBACKS, AND TRADE-OFFS (8
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This blog post provides a discussion on blockchains and their

developers' decision to use one blockchain over another include the
offer of unique benefits such as decentralization and smart contracts,
balanced against potential drawbacks such as speed, cost, and
regulatory uncertainty. While infrastructure improvements are helping
