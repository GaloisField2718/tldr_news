MARKETS & BUSINESS

 GLOBAL REGULATORS, EXCHANGES PUSH BACK ON TOKENIZED STOCKS (5 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Global financial regulators, including ESMA, IOSCO, and the World
Federation of Exchanges, are urging the SEC to strengthen oversight of
tokenized stocks, arguing these products misleadingly mimic
traditional equities without providing equivalent investor
protections. The organizations have expressed alarm at the growing
number of brokers and crypto platforms offering tokenized stocks,
claiming they are marketed as equivalent to actual stocks when they
fundamentally are not, potentially exposing investors to significant
risks. This regulatory pushback comes as tokenized assets reach $26
billion in value and major platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, and
Robinhood expand into the space, mirroring previous successful
lobbying efforts by traditional financial institutions to limit
blockchain-based competition. Despite these concerns, SEC leadership
has indicated openness to tokenization innovation while emphasizing
that tokenized securities must still comply with existing securities
laws. 

 GALAXY, MULTICOIN, JUMP PLAN $1B SOLANA TREASURY (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto are in talks with
backers to raise $1B for a dedicated Solana treasury in what would be
the largest accumulation vehicle for the token. Cantor Fitzgerald is
acting as lead banker, with plans to structure the effort as a digital
asset treasury company via the takeover of a publicly traded entity.
The Solana Foundation has reportedly endorsed the effort.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 LATAM STABLECOIN PAYMENTS LANDSCAPE V2 RELEASED (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 An updated map of the Latin American stablecoin ecosystem highlights
surging adoption, with USDT and USDC accounting for over 90% of July
2025 exchange volume. Local stablecoins are also booming, with
BRL-pegged tokens up 660% year-on-year and MXN-pegged volumes growing
1,000x. Version 2 expands coverage across wallets, exchanges, issuers,
and on/off ramps, reflecting the rapid buildout of stablecoin
infrastructure across the region. 

 BLIND: THE SOCIAL CAPITAL LAUNCHPAD (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blind is a new token launchpad launching on Base that enables users
to leverage their social capital while maintaining privacy control
over their identity data. The platform pulls social statistics from
connected X accounts and various data sources, including Ethos Network
and Kaito, allowing users to selectively reveal metrics like follower
counts, reputation scores, and mutual connections when deploying
tokens. A key differentiator is a social gating functionality that
restricts token launch participation to users meeting specific
criteria, such as follower thresholds or mutual connections with
particular accounts, implemented through Uniswap V4 custom hooks.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 A NON-LEVERAGED STABLECOIN THREAD (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are eleven non-leveraged stablecoin strategies offering >10%
APR, ranging from simple fixed-rate options like Pendle's 18% APR
locks to more complex multi-step approaches yielding up to 30%.
Highlights include Gearbox's lending campaigns (14-30% across
different chains), InfiniFi's flexible-duration Pendle PT ETF (9-17%
APY), and Gauntlet's fee-free alpha vault at 11.7% APY with USDC
liquidity. There are upcoming launches for Solstice (19%) and Neutrl
(29%), plus a complex basis trade strategy combining syrupUSDC margin,
HYPE shorts, and Pendle PT positions for 24% total APR. 

 ZORA'S BIG BET: TURNING CONTENT INTO COINS (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Zora's "content coins" thesis aims to tokenize individual pieces of
content to capture both subjective and commercial value, challenging
the current creator economy where platforms retain 65% of the $320B
market through extractive revenue splits. The model faces criticism
over whether ordinary users' content has sufficient value beyond
speculative collecting, with Base's messaging emphasizing subjective
value while avoiding concrete commercial value capture mechanisms.
Critics argue that "buying posts" behavior won't scale for normie
content, though similar patterns already exist through tipping
culture, Reddit gold, and creator collectibles across platforms.
Zora's success depends on developing programmable revenue sharing,
onchain sponsorship routing, and creator investment tools that could
transform social platforms from synthetic attention derivatives into
spot markets for granular content ownership.

 HOW TO NOT LOSE MONEY IN PREDICTION MARKETS (35 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The current wave of "prediction market for X" projects mirrors failed
"Uber for Y" concepts and will largely collapse due to fundamental
misunderstandings of market microstructure and liquidity sourcing.
Successful prediction markets require exogenous information flow,
perpetual variance, and natural hedgers bringing differentiated views
– elements that most verticalized applications lack since they
attempt to manufacture variance internally rather than sourcing it
from real-world needs. Tokens and memecoins already function as
effective prediction markets for attention and narrative momentum,
demonstrating that markets succeed through mimetic behavior where
participants want to be "right together" rather than through novel
application skins. The space needs innovation in market architecture
and perpetualization mechanisms rather than more specialized
verticals, as episodic binary bets naturally decay while continuous
structures compound liquidity and variance forward. 

 AAVE NOW COMPARABLE TO 37TH-LARGEST U.S. BANK BY ASSETS (1 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Aave's $71.15B in assets would rank it as the 37th-largest U.S. bank,
just behind UMB and ahead of Old National Bank. Unlike banks, Aave is
an open DeFi protocol with no branches, offering non-Fed–correlated
yield that any financial institution can plug into.
