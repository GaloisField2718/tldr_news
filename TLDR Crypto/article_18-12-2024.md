 US LAWMAKERS CANCEL SESSION TO CONSIDER CAROLINE CRENSHAW'S
NOMINATION (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Senate Banking Committee has canceled the session to consider SEC
Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw's renomination, significantly reducing
the likelihood of her confirmation before Republicans take control of
the chamber in January 2025. Crenshaw, whose current term expires in
June 2025, faces opposition from crypto interest groups who claim she
is more anti-crypto than Chair Gary Gensler. She can continue serving
for 18 months after her term expires.

laundering, fraudulent IT work, and crypto thefts.

 TOWARDS TRUSTED AUTONOMY: ROBOTICS, AI, AND BLOCKCHAIN (90 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 An industry report from OpenMind explores how the convergence of
robotics, AI, and blockchain technologies could enable truly
autonomous, trustworthy machines, with blockchain serving as the
infrastructure layer for robot-to-robot and human-robot interactions.
It highlights how blockchain can provide secure identity verification,
transparent operation logging, and programmable economic incentives
for robots, while also addressing key challenges in data privacy,
coordination, and trustless verification. The report identifies
several emerging trends, including decentralized robotics networks,
hardware-level security through TEEs, and crypto-economic incentives
for robotic tasks, suggesting that blockchain technology could be
essential for scaling autonomous systems while maintaining security
and accountability in human-robot interactions. 

 THE CRYPTOPRENEUR'S DILEMMA (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto entrepreneurs must choose between adhering to blockchain's
original cypherpunk principles (decentralization, privacy, and
self-sovereignty) and adopting more conventional business practices to
achieve mainstream success and regulatory compliance. As the industry
matures and integrates with traditional finance and business models,
the tension is becoming more pronounced. While most projects will
likely choose the path of integration and regulation, a critical mass
of developers must continue building decentralized systems to preserve
blockchain's revolutionary potential.
