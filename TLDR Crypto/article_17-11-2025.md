 CRYPTO MARKET SLIPS INTO ‘EXTREME FEAR,' BTC DROPS BELOW $100,000
(5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The crypto Fear & Greed Index plunged to 10, marking extreme fear
levels unseen since late February, as Bitcoin dropped over 5% in a
week to trade below $96,000 after failing twice this month to hold the
$100,000 level. The selloff stems from long-term holder profit-taking,
institutional outflows, leveraged liquidations, and macro uncertainty
as Federal Reserve rate cut odds fell to 50% while the recent
government shutdown delayed key economic data releases. Order-book
depth across major centralized exchanges remains structurally lower
since October's crash, creating low liquidity conditions that risk
amplified price swings. 

 HARVARD TRIPLES BITCOIN ETF HOLDINGS TO $443M (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Harvard University's $57 billion endowment tripled its spot bitcoin
ETF exposure in Q3, holding 6.8 million shares of BlackRock's IBIT, up
257% from June, making it Harvard's largest declared US holding ahead
of Microsoft and Amazon. Valued at $442.8 million at the time, now
around $364 million after IBIT's price decline, the position equals
roughly 0.6% of the endowment.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AERO: ONE TOKEN. ONE ENGINE. ONE LIQUIDITY LAYER (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Aerodrome and Velodrome are merging into Aero with a single AERO
token launching Q2 2026 on Base as the operational hub, distributing
94.5% to AERO holders and 5.5% to VELO holders based on their $260
million versus $15 million in trailing 52-week revenue. The MetaDEX03
architecture expands revenue capture beyond swap fees to include
front-end routing, internal MEV auctions, cross-chain bridging, and
liquidity automation targeting a $7 billion market, with all value
flowing to AERO token holders. Aero deploys across Ethereum mainnet,
Arc, and Syndicate using hub-and-spoke architecture, while the new
Momentum Fund replaces existing programs to direct rewards, execute
rule-based buybacks and burns, and compensate high-impact contributors
with veAERO tokens. 

 MOONPAY LAUNCHES ENTERPRISE STABLECOIN ISSUANCE PLATFORM (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 MoonPay has launched a new enterprise-grade stablecoin issuance
business powered by Iron and M0, enabling partners to create
app-specific, interoperable stablecoins issued directly from the US
and distributed globally through MoonPay's buy, sell, swap, deposit,
and checkout network.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 UNPACKING THE DAI STACK (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The deAI stack comprises three interoperable layers: x402 from
Coinbase and Cloudflare for agent payments via stablecoins at the
application layer, ERC 8004 as an onchain discovery registry mapping
agent IDs to capabilities using NFT-based AgentCards, and Google's A2A
protocol for handling transport-layer communication through JSON-RPC
over HTTPS. These standards mirror the traditional internet stack,
where TCP/IP handles transport, DNS manages discovery, and HTTP
enables applications, but extends functionality to allow agents to
transact and coordinate with onchain resources. The architecture
enables complete workflows like purchasing a refrigerator, where ERC
8004 discovers the merchant agent, A2A facilitates communication over
HTTP endpoints, and X402 processes stablecoin payments and
authorization. 

 UAE FINANCIAL SERVICES CONSOLIDATION CONTROVERSY (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The UAE's Federal-Decree Law No. 6 of 2025 criminalizes unlicensed
financial activities with imprisonment and fines up to AED 500 million
($136 million), while Article 62's "facilitation" language extends
regulatory reach to technology providers offering infrastructure that
enables financial services. Critics argue the law effectively bans
self-custodial Bitcoin wallets, blockchain explorers, and similar
tools for UAE citizens without Central Bank licensing, as it captures
entities "directly or indirectly" facilitating licensed activities
even when not offering underlying financial products.

 ETH'S TIME WILL COME IN EARLY 2026 (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 While ETH's chart looks weak now, it's entering a slow consolidation
near key ETH/BTC support that typically precedes stronger cycles, with
the real move likely between late Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. The end of
quantitative tightening in December and a potential shift toward QE
could release liquidity back into markets, favoring risk assets like
ETH and altcoins once the Reverse Repo facility empties and the Fed
stops absorbing capital. 

 DEFI YIELD HAS EVOLVED (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 DeFi yield protocols have evolved from 2020's degen farming to
institutional-grade structured income, led by Aave v4's $40B
cross-chain liquidity layer with dynamic risk pricing and Morpho's
$11B efficiency layer that supercharges Aave and Compound rates.
Pendle dominates yield tokenization at $6B TVL with its new Boros
product packaging perpetual funding rates into tradable assets, while
Solstice builds Solana's institutional yield infrastructure at $270M
TVL, offering fixed, variable, and boosted delta-neutral returns.
Emerging players include Katana's yield-first L2 delivering 8-41% APYs
on $249M TVL and Turtle's campaign-driven router reaching 40.8% APY in
its Yearn USD vault across $600M in deposits.
