TLDR CRYPTO 2025-12-22

 PRIVACY IS READY FOR ITS MOMENT IN BLOCKCHAIN (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The transparency of traditional blockchains forces a difficult
choice: utility or privacy. While transparency can build trust, it can
also expose user activity and personal data. Midnight [4] empowers
innovators to break free from this limitation, to a place where
privacy is not just a feature, but foundational.

Midnight is a fourth-generation blockchain redefining onchain privacy
with a novel token economic model and programmable privacy with
selective disclosure. Meaning a better experience where users and
developers can control their own data.

Privacy matters. If it matters to you...

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 LAWMAKERS PROPOSE TAX RELIEF FOR SMALL STABLECOIN TRANSACTIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Representatives Max Miller and Steven Horsford proposed amending the
IRS Code to exempt stablecoin transactions under $200 from capital
gains taxes if issued by GENIUS Act-permitted issuers pegged to the
dollar with stable trading ranges, while excluding brokers and dealers
from the benefit. The draft allows taxpayers to defer income
recognition on staking and mining rewards for up to five years rather
than immediate taxation, addressing "phantom income" concerns, and
extends securities lending treatment to digital asset lending
arrangements. 

 COINBASE SUES THREE STATES OVER PREDICTION MARKET REGULATION (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Coinbase filed federal lawsuits against Connecticut, Michigan, and
Illinois, arguing that prediction markets fall under the CFTC's
exclusive federal jurisdiction rather than state gaming boards. The
Illinois Gaming Board issued cease-and-desist letters to Kalshi,
Robinhood, and Crypto.com in April over sports event contracts,
claiming state law violations. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal argues
Congress deliberately excluded only specific commodities like onions
from CFTC jurisdiction, making all other subjects, including sports,
federally regulated.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 QUANTUM & BITCOIN (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Quantum computing is transitioning from “remote theory” to a
plausible engineering timeline, and Bitcoin's slow governance means
the network needs to start post-quantum prep now, not when a
“Q-day” headline hits. The core fears include keys getting
cracked, panic, contentious forks, and institutional confidence
breaking if the community has to decide under duress. Furthermore,
there's a world where millions of BTC in old “pay-to-public-key”
outputs (including Satoshi-era coins) that can't be proactively
migrated, forcing a future decision between freezing them or letting a
quantum-capable attacker scoop them. 

 JPMORGAN'S TOKENIZED DOLLARS ARE REWIRING MONEY (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 JPMorgan launched its JPM Coin tokenized deposits on Coinbase's Base
blockchain, driven by institutional demand for bank deposit products
on public chains that can be interest-bearing, unlike stablecoins
restricted by the GENIUS Act. The permissioned, whitelisted JPMD
serves clients using Coinbase for crypto transactions as collateral
and margin payments, offering different risk profiles than stablecoins
or off-chain bank accounts with cutoff time issues. Tokenized deposits
are the "cousin of stablecoins" as banks face interoperability
challenges exporting products beyond their four walls versus
stablecoins' broader distribution. The bank maintains sole control
over the smart contract with proper key storage and role separation,
positioning public blockchain infrastructure as the destination for
innovation and customer activity.

 MESSARI 2026 THESIS (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ~80% of this year's themes show up in Messari's 2026 thesis, with
standout sections on “crypto money,” “TradFi x crypto,” and
“decentralized internet finance.” Most L1s can't rely on fee
capture in a cheap-blockspace world, so they lean on “monetary
premiums” (belief-based value), but only a few assets can sustain
that. Messari's ETH framing is ultimately also slightly contradictory,
as they are bearish on fees/revenue share and bullish on “winning
sectors” like RWAs. RWAs may simply be low-velocity (vault-like), so
they don't translate into high chain revenue. 

 GALAXY RESEARCH'S 2026 PREDICTIONS (25 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 2025 is a year where prices ended roughly flat-to-down despite real
institutional progress, whereas 2026 is about activation. Stablecoins
will push deeper into payments, and tokenized assets will move into
mainstream collateral/settlement. Galaxy's 26 calls range from
big-picture (stablecoins overtaking ACH volume, and
corporate/permissioned L1s doing real settlement) to very specific
(DEX spot share >25%, Polymarket weekly volumes >$1.5B, and more ETF
launches).

MISCELLANEOUS

 STABLECOINS' REAL PRODUCT IS BETTER SETTLEMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Stablecoin transaction volume roughly doubled YoY, but the growth
isn't mainly consumers buying coffee. The biggest slices are Internal
transfers and B2B flows, with retail-like categories (P2P/P2B/B2P)
much smaller in comparison. There's also a clear weekday greater than
weekend pattern, which is exactly what you'd expect if stablecoins are
increasingly used as business settlement plumbing. 

 AI X CRYPTO IS DEAD, LONG LIVE AI X CRYPTO (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The AI x crypto theme evolved from 2023's decentralized data
marketplaces and compute sharing to 2025's autonomous agents managing
assets and executing trades. Bittensor surpassed $10 billion market
cap as x402 payment protocols enable seamless high-volume settlements
without human oversight. Agentic tooling revolutionized onchain
development, allowing non-technical founders to launch businesses in
days. Grayscale's Decentralized AI Fund holding NEAR, TAO, and FIL
signals institutional buy-in. Crypto primitives address AI's
centralization risks while AI enhances blockchain usability.
Regulatory tailwinds will potentially accelerate adoption toward new
highs in 2026.
