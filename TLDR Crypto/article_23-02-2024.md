 RESTAKING PORTFOLIOS 101 (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 EigenLayer‚Äôs restaking mechanism has taken center stage recently,
but there is quite a bit of confusion around how it works and how big
of a role it might play in the Ethereum ecosystem. This post provides
a good overview to get familiar with restaking. Unlike traditional
staking, restaking allows users to secure one or multiple
decentralized services, termed as Actively Validated Services (AVS).
EigenLayer claims that this mechanism allows non-Ethereum protocols to
tap into Ethereum‚Äôs security, but some fear that it could have
unintended consequences.

 THE REAL STORY OF THE SEC‚ÄôS SUIT AGAINST KRAKEN, AND WHY KRAKEN IS
MOVING TO DISMISS THE CASE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Kraken is standing up to what it claims to be overreach by the SEC
during a congressional hearing. The company argues that existing laws
are insufficient to cover the crypto landscape and that concurrent
principles limit creativity in the sector. The company vouched for
Congress to define rules that cater to the specific risks and benefits
of crypto. Kraken recently filed a motion to curb the SEC's lawsuit
against it, citing jurisdictional issues and ambiguities in crypto
investments classification. 

 WHERE ARE WE IN THE MARKET CYCLE? (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This thread from Lattice Fund partner Regan Bozeman attempts to
explain where we are in this crypto cycle, with a focus on where
venture funds are and how they‚Äôre thinking about the cycle. Many
venture funds were likely caught offside late last year as the market
surged and they are now scrambling to deploy capital. Bozeman also
discusses some of the market dynamics and eccentricities, such as
memecoins, that venture funds and their LPs don‚Äôt have to consider
in other industries.
