MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN REBOUNDS ABOVE $88K (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin recovered to $87,600, up 2.5% from its $85,550 weekend low.
There was a shift from aggressive selling to orderly derisking with
stabilizing open interest and muted spot activity despite persistent
ETF outflows. Options sentiment turned cautiously optimistic as the
25-delta skew rebounded from -10.96 to -4.58 while Long Call Condor
block trades across $100,000-$118,000 strikes indicate demand for
upside exposure into late 2025. Analysts believe Bitcoin must reclaim
the $87,000-$88,000 range for sustained gains. Institutions are
patiently bullish and building conviction ahead of December's Federal
Reserve interest rate decision, which may be the next major catalyst. 

 CHINA RETURNS AS BITCOIN MINING HUB WITH 14% MARKET SHARE (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 China reclaimed the third-largest Bitcoin mining position with
approximately 14% of global hashrate by October despite the 2021 ban,
driven by cheap electricity and excess data center capacity in
Xinjiang and Sichuan provinces. 15-20% of global mining capacity now
operates underground in China, which has softer policy signals,
including Hong Kong's stablecoin legislation and yuan-backed
stablecoin discussions indicating a more flexible stance. Bitcoin
hashprice hit an all-time low of $34.2 per petahash per second on
Friday, driven by Bitcoin's 30%+ decline from October peaks, subdued
transaction fees, and network hashrate above one zettahash (10% below
recent highs). The next difficulty adjustment is expected on
Wednesday.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 FULL SEND: FASTEST PATH FOR TRANSACTION INCLUSION (4 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Spire has launched Full Send, a free Ethereum mainnet RPC built on
its DA Builder aggregation layer. It claims transaction inclusion
within 0.8 blocks versus typical 2-block delays while offering MEV
protection and a 95% success rate compared to 70-85% for other
services. The self-custodial infrastructure sits between wallets and
chains, optimizing transaction routing through intelligent ordering
for better execution prices and near-100% guaranteed inclusions
without revert risk. Full Send supports any EVM wallet, including
MetaMask, Rabby, and Rainbow, through a one-click setup. 

 CROSS RIVER LAUNCHES STABLECOIN PAYMENTS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cross River Bank launched a stablecoin payments infrastructure,
unifying fiat and stablecoin flows in a single interoperable system
that eliminates pre-funding requirements and ledger rebuilding for
network settlement, merchant payouts, and treasury management. The
platform targets $20 trillion in annual stablecoin volumes by
providing bank-grade compliance and programmability for fintechs,
enterprises, and crypto-native companies without operational sprawl
across fragmented rails. The infrastructure is available today for
approved partners, with broader availability planned.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 UNDERSTANDING SIMD-0411 (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Solana's SIMD-0411 proposal doubles the disinflation rate from -15%
to -30% annually, accelerating terminal inflation arrival from 6.2
years to 3.1 years while reducing emissions by 22.3 million SOL over
six years, worth $2.9 billion at current prices. The single-parameter
change delivers similar emissions reduction as the failed SIMD-0228
without introducing dynamic, stake-responsive formulas that raised
implementation complexity and governance friction. Nominal staking
yields decline from the current 4.18% to 5.04% in year one, 3.48% in
year two, and 2.42% in year three, pushing approximately 10 validators
into unprofitability initially while strengthening long-term SOL value
through reduced dilution. The deterministic, easily modeled approach
contrasts with SIMD-0228's exponential function, tying inflation to
staking participation percentages, offering validators and
institutions predictable outcomes without changing the 1.5% terminal
rate the ecosystem already aligns around. 

 COINBASE VENTURES: WHAT THEY WANT TO FUND IN 2026 (3 MINUTE READ) [9]


 In this post, Coinbase Ventures lays out the themes it is actively
looking to back: RWA perpetuals, new exchange/terminal designs
(especially for perps and prediction markets), next-gen DeFi
(composable perps, unsecured credit, and privacy), and AI + robotics
plays that plug into crypto (DePIN-style robotics data, proof of
humanity, and AI agents for dev/security).

MISCELLANEOUS

 TOKENIZATION ONLY MATTERS IF MONEY MOVES (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Tokenizing an asset is just the starting point, as without either
long-term lock-in or frequent real usage, you've just created “dead
money” that sits onchain and earns nothing. There are only two
long-lasting ways for a tokenized asset to generate fees: it must
attract committed, parked capital by paying yield and rewarding
conviction, or be used constantly so velocity plus fees make it
valuable. 

 STABLECOIN ISSUANCE IS GETTING COMMODITIZED (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stablecoin issuance is shifting from a bespoke, high-margin business
to a cheap, white-label commodity offered by platforms like Circle,
Brale, M0, Bridge, Paxos, and Agora. As costs fall and issuers share
more of the T-bill yield with partners, launching your own branded
stablecoin becomes easy and primarily about owning the customer
relationship, payment rail, and interest income. Commoditization of
issuance pushes competition up the stack as products will increasingly
differentiate on UX, distribution, regulation, and niche use cases.
