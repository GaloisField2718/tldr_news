MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC'S HESTER PEIRCE PUSHES FOR PRIVACY AND TOKENIZATION REFORM (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said tokenization is now a “huge
focus” for the agency, highlighting ongoing work on token
distribution rules, transaction definitions, and crypto custody
guidance. Speaking at the DC Privacy Summit, she also renewed calls
for stronger financial privacy protections, warning against excessive
government data access and citing the Fourth Amendment as a safeguard.
Peirce suggested crypto could help the US rethink Bank Secrecy Act,
AML, and KYC frameworks to better fit peer-to-peer systems, framing
the current policy debate as a chance to modernize financial
oversight. 

 MAS LAUNCHES BLOOM INITIATIVE TO EXTEND SETTLEMENT CAPABILITIES (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Singapore's Monetary Authority has launched BLOOM (Borderless,
Liquid, Open, Online, Multi-currency) to enable settlement in
tokenized bank liabilities and regulated stablecoins while managing
risks through standardized approaches, building on Project Orchid's
foundation of 10+ successful trials since 2021 that explored digital
Singapore dollar infrastructure and use cases. The initiative focuses
on three areas: distribution and clearing of settlement assets to
coordinate networks and enable seamless transfer of different
settlement asset forms, programmable compliance controls using
standardized mechanisms for more consistent and cost-effective
cross-border wholesale arrangements, and agentic payments exploring AI
agents executing transactions automatically within predefined limits
to optimize timing and reduce manual payment management. Initial
members include Circle, DBS, OCBC, Stripe, UOB, Ant International,
StraitsX, Coinbase, and Partior.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE LAUNCHES STABLECOIN PAYMENTS PLATFORM FOR BUSINESSES (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Coinbase Business is an all-in-one platform for small and midsize
companies to receive crypto payments, manage assets, and earn up to
4.1% APY on USDC holdings. The service offers instant settlements,
QuickBooks and Xero integrations, and self-service onboarding within
two days, aiming to modernize business banking with crypto rails. By
blending payments, yield, and accounting, Coinbase positions itself
against fintechs like Mercury and Brex while leveraging its
partnership with Circle to expand USDC adoption. 

 INTRODUCING PROPAGANDA (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 PROPAGANDA operates as a sustainable business focused on research,
design, development, and go-to-market for risky experimental projects
across prediction markets, yield experiments, money games, x-to-earn
mechanics, commerce, and communication, having launched 31 brand
collaborations since January. The project emphasizes that "holding a
little will get you a lot" through a portfolio of experiments ranging
from weekend ephemeral projects to six-month moonshots with constantly
evolving strategy where holders always come first, while all product
profits are staked on Morpho with yield used for daily token buybacks,
creating a sustainable compounding mechanism. It is a leading Zora
Creator Coin.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 SIRE LAUNCHES AVAULT (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sire is rolling out aVault, an automated USDC trading vault powered
by its AI agents, offering passive exposure to sports and market
strategies. Users deposit USDC to receive αVault units whose value
tracks performance, with early internal tests showing +137% ROI on
$10K over ~2 months. Fees include a 2% management charge, a 20%
performance fee (dropping to 10% for large $SIRE stakers), and a 2%
withdrawal fee (100% of which goes to stakers). The launch began on
October 16 with three phases, prioritizing $SIRE holders (25K+ first,
1K+ next, then open to all). The system's high-water mark ensures
users pay fees only on new profits, while stakers share in vault
success and future buybacks. 

 WIDE SANDWICH ATTACKS EXPLAINED (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Wide sandwich attacks spanning multiple slots now account for 93% of
all sandwiches on Solana, with bots extracting 529,000 SOL over a full
year by frontrunning and backrunning victim transactions across
different slots that evade standard detectors. January marked peak
extraction at 87,000 SOL in one month, though monthly extraction
remains steady at 30-60k SOL, with top bots waiting for high-value
victims and averaging 0.46 SOL per sandwich by sending dual bundles
containing frontrun and first break-even backrun, followed by second
backrun to capture remaining profit. Axiom users suffered 70%+ of
extracted SOL, followed by Bloom at 10-15% and Photon at 5-10%, while
23 validators had at least 6% of leader slots containing wide
sandwiches, suggesting private order flow sharing with main stake from
Marinade and Jito, including six receiving Solana Foundation stake.
Low-cap token buyers face the highest risk due to low liquidity
creating high price impact and default slippage settings.

 STEAK 'N SHAKE DEBUTS 'BITCOIN STEAKBURGER' WITH BTC LOGO ON BUN (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Steak 'n Shake launched the Bitcoin Steakburger featuring the BTC
logo stamped on the bun to celebrate five months of accepting Bitcoin
payments across all locations, giving over 100 million customers the
option to purchase burgers and milkshakes with cryptocurrency since
the May rollout. The Bitcoin community engagement has driven
double-digit same-store sales increases in both Q2 and Q3 2025, which
the brand attributes partially to Bitcoin enthusiast support,
demonstrating concrete business impact from crypto payment adoption. 

 $300 TRILLION OF PYUSD ACCIDENTALLY MINTED AND BURNED (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Paxos mistakenly minted $300 trillion worth of PayPal's PYUSD
stablecoin on Wednesday in a "technical error" during an internal
transfer before immediately identifying and burning the excess tokens
within 20 minutes, with the company confirming no security breach and
customer funds remaining safe. PYUSD's dollar peg is guaranteed by
PayPal and third-party attestation reports rather than intrinsically
tied to minting mechanisms, as there aren't enough dollars in global
circulation to back $300 trillion, which would require more than
double the world's estimated total GDP.
