 SEC ALLOWS BROKER-DEALERS TO COUNT STABLECOINS AS REGULATORY CAPITAL
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The SEC issued new guidance allowing US broker-dealers to count
stablecoin holdings as regulatory capital with just a 2% haircut,
effectively treating 98% of these digital dollar assets as cash
equivalents on balance sheets. This marks a significant departure from
previous treatment of crypto assets, which typically faced much higher
capital charges or were excluded entirely from regulatory capital
calculations. The policy shift could accelerate adoption of tokenized
securities and on-chain settlement infrastructure among traditional
financial institutions by removing a major capital efficiency barrier
for firms holding stablecoins to facilitate blockchain-based
transactions. 

 WHITE HOUSE SETS MARCH 1 DEADLINE ON STABLECOIN REWARDS DISPUTE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The White House set a March 1 deadline to resolve the stablecoin
rewards dispute, currently the primary obstacle blocking passage of
the Clarity Act. The administration held its third closed-door crypto
meeting with industry stakeholders, including Ripple, the Blockchain
Association, the Crypto Council for Innovation, and major banking
trade associations. Lawmakers remain split on whether stablecoins
should be permitted to offer yield to holders, with the issue now
representing one of the last major sticking points in comprehensive
crypto legislation.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 DFLOW MCP: INSTANT TRADING ACCESS FOR AGENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DFlow launched an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives AI
agents structured access to its complete Solana trading API
documentation, replacing search-based integration with direct
canonical queries across Trading, Metadata, and Proof APIs. Agents can
now programmatically detect prediction market arbitrage opportunities
(such as YES + NO asks totaling less than $1), stream websocket data
for automated execution, and debug trade failures by inspecting live
API specs. The server integrates with OpenClaw, Claude, Cursor, and
other AI development environments, enabling agents to route orders
through specific DEXes, track outcome token balances, and build
automated trading strategies without manual API documentation parsing.


 A NEW, UNIFIED STACK FOR BASE CHAIN (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Base is evolving from the OP Stack to a unified, Base-operated tech
stack, with node operators needing to migrate to Base's client
releases instead of following Optimism's releases in the coming months
as part of the transition. The move aims to achieve three objectives:
doubling the upgrade cadence from three to six hard forks annually for
faster shipping, reducing cognitive overhead by simplifying the
codebase to be understandable by a single developer rather than
maintaining complex external dependencies across multiple teams and
repositories, and accelerating deployment of high-impact changes ahead
of Ethereum's L1 to inform the mainnet roadmap. The upcoming Base V1
hard fork will implement client consolidation requiring node operator
migration, transition from Optimistic proofs to TEE/ZK proofs for
faster finality, and support Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade, with future
releases including Block Access Lists, new transaction types, op-code
repricing, and economic changes aligned with Ethereum's roadmap.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO FIX TOKENS: PROFIT FROM HOLDING, NOT SELLING (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Crypto tokens are structurally misaligned because holders profit by
selling into others rather than by holding, creating an exit game of
insider unlocks and retail dilution. There should be a model where
100% of protocol revenue is governed by tokenholders and distributed
directly, shifting incentives toward long-term ownership and revenue
growth. With improving infrastructure and a rare regulatory window in
2025, explicit revenue-sharing tokens (rather than buybacks, burns, or
inflationary staking) should define the next era of crypto design
before policymakers lock in rules around the current extractive model.


 IS YOUR PAYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE READY FOR AGENTIC PAYMENTS? (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 AI agents could drive $500 billion in US commerce by 2030, requiring
payment systems to evolve from manual clicks to autonomous delegation.
Success depends on ledger-grade guarantees to prevent double spending
and ensure auditability during high-concurrency automated retries.

 OPTIMISM'S UGLY YEAR (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Coinbase is moving Base from the OP Stack to an independent unified
stack, jeopardizing the Optimism Superchain. Base generates 97% of
Superchain revenue, leaving the ecosystem financially vulnerable. The
OP token is down 97% from its peak, and ether.fi recently committed to
migrating 300,000 accounts. 

 ‘THIS IS WRONG,' VITALIK BUTERIN SLAMS WEB4 VISION OF
SUPERINTELLIGENT AI (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin rejected Sigil Wen's Web4 vision,
citing its reliance on centralized providers like OpenAI and
Anthropic. Buterin argues that removing humans from AI feedback loops
risks irreversible anti-human outcomes. He emphasizes that technology
should prioritize human agency over autonomous, self-replicating
systems.
