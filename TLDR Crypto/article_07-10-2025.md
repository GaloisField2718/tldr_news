MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO FUNDS SEE RECORD $6B WEEKLY INFLOWS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Global crypto investment products recorded ~$6 billion in inflows,
the largest weekly total ever, as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high and
Ethereum climbed past $4,500. CoinShares attributed the increase to
delayed reactions to the Fed's rate cut, weak US jobs data, and
renewed confidence after the government shutdown. US-based funds led
with $5 billion, followed by record weeks for Switzerland ($563M) and
Germany ($312M). 

 VOLUMES ASTER DEX MIMIC BINANCE, RAISING WASH TRADING QUESTIONS (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DefiLlama delisted Aster's perpetuals data after founder 0xngmi
discovered XRP trading volumes that mirrored Binance almost
tick-for-tick with a near-perfect 1:1 correlation ratio, suggesting
possible wash trading or data manipulation since organic decentralized
order flow typically diverges from centralized exchanges. Aster had
rapidly risen to the top of DefiLlama's leaderboard for daily fees and
volume across perpetual DEXs, briefly overtaking Hyperliquid, while
its ASTER token surged from 9 cents to over $2 in under three weeks
for returns exceeding 1,500% among the best-performing tokens in
recent months. The controversy intensified due to timing coincidences,
as Binance announced ASTER listing with a "Seed Tag" on the same day
as the delisting, with Binance co-founder CZ Zhao serving as an Aster
advisor and vocal proponent on social media. While Aster showed a
"low" score in one wash trading risk model, the suspicious volume
correlation raised sufficient red flags for delisting, contrasting
with Hyperliquid's looser 0.59 correlation with Binance that allowed
it to maintain its metrics despite a "medium" wash trading score.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GALAXY LAUNCHES GALAXYONE FOR CRYPTO, STOCKS, AND 8% YIELDS (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Galaxy Digital has launched GalaxyOne, a unified consumer platform
and app offering US users crypto and stock trading, high-yield
accounts, and integrated custody. The platform provides 4% APY on cash
deposits and up to 8% APY for accredited investors through Galaxy's
institutional lending-backed note. At launch, users can trade Bitcoin,
Ether, Solana, Paxos Gold, and over 2,000 US stocks and ETFs with zero
commissions and fractional shares. 

 INTRODUCING ERC-S (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Street's ERC-S is a solution to ERC-20 tokens' lack of intrinsic
value and difficulty validating multi-billion dollar FDVs through
governance or utility alone, creating the first possibility for
tokenizing startups like OpenAI and SpaceX without securities
classification under the Howey Test. The standard enables exposure to
startup economic upside through an operational flow where operating
companies route discretionary payments to SPV/Foundation shareholders,
who then distribute to tokenholders via DAO governance with
transparent operations and automatic pause triggers during disputes.
ERC-S addresses wrapper token failures, including redemption bank-run
dynamics, governance capture risks, and unclear enforceability, by
anchoring value in actual equity ownership at the company layer while
keeping tokenholders outside the buyer's transaction perimeter during
exits. The framework includes a 20-module scenario library that
standardizes applications across launch, operations, and exit phases,
enabling startups to raise millions and bootstrap thousands of users
without selling equity while allowing later-stage companies to avoid
synthetic platforms like Robinhood that cost them billions in weekly
revenue through natural price discovery and direct tokenization.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHY PREDICTION MARKETS ARE DISPLACING TRADITIONAL SPORTSBOOKS (20
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 DraftKings and Flutter lost $7 billion in combined market
capitalization last week when Kalshi launched same-game parlays,
demonstrating that prediction markets pose an existential threat to
the traditional sportsbook duopoly that controls 67% of the $150
billion US sports betting market through systematic limitation of
winning customers. Massachusetts Gaming Commission investigations
revealed that traditional sportsbooks restrict 0.64% of bettors from
winning while raising limits for losing customers, creating a
two-tiered system that punishes skill and rewards failure, prompting
New York's proposed Fair Play Act to ban limiting practices entirely.
Prediction markets offer superior economics with no house edge,
unlimited action for skilled bettors, transparent order books, and the
ability to attract institutional capital that traditional sportsbooks
systematically exclude, while platforms like Polymarket, Kalshi,
NOVIG, and Robinhood have raised hundreds of millions in venture
funding to capture the $84 billion illegal offshore betting market
that DraftKings and FanDuel have failed to convert. 

 TOKEN2049 IN RETROSPECT (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Token2049 2025 shifted from last year's election-driven optimism to a
builder-focused atmosphere with prediction markets dominating
conversations as founders launch niche platforms and related products,
while AI hype has cooled with only legitimate builders remaining after
speculators moved to prediction markets and perp DEXs. Prediction
markets are emerging as the "new memecoin trench" where participants
have higher odds of turning $100 into $1M by leveraging domain
expertise in sports, politics, culture, or macro rather than facing
the near-zero success rates in meme token speculation, while also
serving as hedging tools similar to perps but for events rather than
asset prices. Major upcoming DeAI launches include Sentient's
Darwinian AI with 100+ integrated services, Almanak's DeFAI smart
contract optimization with over $100M deposited, Allora's AI Oracle
for dynamic DeFi, Talus's verifiable agent infrastructure on Sui,
Fraction AI's competitive agent platform, and PlayAI's workflow
builder.

 COULD POLYMARKET TAKE A STAKE IN POLYGON? (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There is a potential strategic alignment between Polymarket and
Polygon ($POL). A stake, validator role, or partnership could mutually
strengthen both ecosystems. Polymarket is crypto's breakout app this
cycle. It's fully built on Polygon, making collaboration more
efficient than building its own chain. Polygon can provide the
infrastructure, and Polymarket can deliver the user and transaction
volume to deepen network value. 

 THE TETHER FRAUD ALLEGATIONS (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The New York Attorney General's investigation revealed Tether was
only 74% backed when confronted, operating without banking access
globally from mid-2017 to September 2017 while holding just $61
million against 442 million tokens in circulation, with executives
admitting under oath to using customer reserves as a "corporate slush
fund" to cover Bitfinex's $850 million losses. University of Texas
research identified specific manipulation patterns where 95 one-hour
periods representing 1% of trading time accounted for 60% of Bitcoin's
price gains, with purchases timed following market downturns and
attributed to a single large entity operating across exchanges.
Despite $61 million in regulatory fines, an ongoing DOJ investigation,
and never completing the independent audit promised since 2015, Tether
has grown to over $120 billion circulation, potentially becoming "too
big to fail" as exchanges, institutions, and regulators may prefer
maintaining the illusion rather than triggering a collapse that could
eliminate $2-2.7 trillion in cryptocurrency market value and destroy
the industry's foundational legitimacy claims.
