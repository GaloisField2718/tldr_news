 BLOOMBERG ANALYSTS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER LIKELIHOOD OF SPOT ETHEREUM
ETF APPROVAL IN MAY TO 30% (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bloomberg ETF analysts have reduced their predicted odds of a spot
Ethereum ETF approval this May to 30%. The primary reason they are
reducing these odds is the lack of filing changes for these products.
However, the market seems to be pricing in better odds than this as
Ethereum has been keeping pace with Bitcoin, surging since the launch
of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. 

 MONAD LABS IN TALKS TO RAISE MORE THAN $200 MILLION ROUND LED BY
PARADIGM, VALUING THE JUMP CRYPTO‚ÄìLINKED STARTUP AT $3 BILLION (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Crypto venture firm Paradigm is leading a funding round for Monad
Labs, a startup aiming to build an ‚ÄòEthereum killer‚Äô. The deal,
valuing Monad at $3 billion, includes over $200 million in funding,
following the company‚Äôs $19 million seed round in February. If
successful, it will be 2024's largest crypto fundraise to date. This
not only shows that investors are interested in what Monad is building
but also that VCs are starting to have an appetite for larger deals.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BASED ESPRESSO: AD-HOC SHARED SEQUENCING FOR ALL L2S, FROM BASED
ROLLUPS TO VALIDIUMS (26 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Espresso Systems is developing a marketplace for shared sequencing
that will enable L2s on Ethereum to sell block space. The project aims
to tackle the fragmentation that is happening in the Ethereum
ecosystem without compromising the benefits of rollups and validiums,
allowing for the unified and efficient execution of user intents
across multiple chains. Espresso is also creating a decentralized
finality gadget, HotShot, to improve transaction confirmation speeds
and security. The goal of this is to facilitate greater
interoperability and reduce transaction costs and latency for
end-users. 

 PROM: ZKEVM L2 SOLUTION BRIDGING MULTIPLE L1 CHAINS (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Prom is launching a new L2 that will be interoperable with both EVM
and non-EVM ecosystems. It offers a cost-efficient and scalable
solution by leveraging zkSNARK technology and Polygon Zero‚Äôs ZK
proof tech. The Prom ecosystem will be powered by its native utility
token, $PROM, which enables transactional and governance
functionalities.

 A SIMPLE ORDINALS THESIS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ordinals could be the leaders as far as NFTs go this cycle due to the
potential resurgence of a 2021-like NFT mania and the perceived
security, decentralization, and affordability of Bitcoin. Bitcoin
whales could catalyze the Ordinals‚Äô price appreciation even further
than was possible with ETH NFTs. This author predicts that most of the
top 10 NFT collections will be on Bitcoin by 2025.

 SOME THOUGHTS ON THE ETH ETF DECISION IN MAY (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While the crypto prediction platform, Polymarket, is putting the odds
of an ETH ETF approval in May at a 24% chance, the author of this
thread believes the chances are much higher. ETH continues to keep
pace with BTC, even though BTC has had the benefit of incredibly
strong ETF inflows. Regardless of whether or not the ETF is approved
in May, the author of this thread is convinced that it will happen at
some point and that the market is already attempting to account for
that. 

 THE INTERNET OF AGENTS (20 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article discusses the prospects of combining blockchain
infrastructure with AI agents. This could lead to an "Internet of
Agents" where AI-driven activities are facilitated by blockchains‚Äô
cryptographic security, incentives, composability, and
decentralization. Possible applications of this approach include AI
prediction markets, user intent matching, action planning, and shared
funds. However, there are potential risks such as the exposure of
model vulnerabilities and the steep costs of implementing secure
machine learning computations.
