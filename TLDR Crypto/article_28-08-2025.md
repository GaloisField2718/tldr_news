MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN UNDERPERFORMS ETHER, BROADER MARKET (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin held above $111,000 but gained less than 1% over 24 hours,
underperforming the broader cryptocurrency market as the CoinDesk 20
Index rose 3.2% and smaller tokens in the CoinDesk 80 gained 4%. With
over $14.6 billion in Bitcoin and Ether options set to expire Friday
at a "max pain" level of $116,000, options sellers have incentives to
push BTC higher toward that strike price to minimize their costs. The
standout performer was Cronos (CRO), which surged over 56% after
Crypto.com and Trump Media announced plans to create a $6.4 billion
CRO treasury company that will integrate the token into Truth Social's
rewards system. Despite Bitcoin's recent sideways action, its 200-day
moving average crossing above $100,000 signals the continuation of a
strong long-term uptrend that has been in place since late April. 

 CIRCLE PUSHES DEEPER INTO PAYMENTS WITH MASTERCARD, FINASTRA DEALS (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Circle announced partnerships with Mastercard and Finastra to embed
USDC settlement into traditional financial infrastructure, with
Mastercard enabling stablecoin settlements for merchants across
Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Finastra will integrate
USDC into its Global PAYplus platform, which processes over $5
trillion in daily cross-border transactions, allowing banks in 50
countries to settle international payments in USDC while maintaining
fiat-denominated payment instructions. These deals showcase Circle's
accelerated push for global USDC adoption against tough competition in
the stablecoin space abroad. The partnerships complement Circle's
recent expansion efforts in Asia, including collaborations with major
South Korean banks and a joint venture in Japan with SBI Group,
Ripple, and Startale.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AAVE LAUNCHES HORIZON, AN RWA-BACKED LENDING MARKET (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Aave Labs' Horizon is a new Ethereum-based lending market where
institutions can borrow stablecoins against tokenized real-world
assets (RWAs). Backed by partners including Circle, Superstate,
Centrifuge, Ripple, VanEck, and WisdomTree, Horizon allows qualified
investors to post RWA collateral and borrow GHO, USDC, or RLUSD, while
retail users can supply stablecoins to earn yield. Horizon bridges
compliant institutional finance with DeFi by integrating NAVLink from
Chainlink for accurate valuations and Llama Risk for oversight,
turning RWAs into productive onchain assets. 

 GOOGLE CLOUD REVEALS UNIVERSAL LEDGER L1 (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google's blockchain, the Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL), is now
in private testnet. Designed as neutral infrastructure for finance,
GCUL features Python-based smart contracts, native commercial bank
money onchain, 24/7 capital markets infrastructure, and “agentic”
payment capabilities. Backed by Google-scale distribution and
institutional partners, CME Group is already piloting tokenized assets
on the network. More technical details are expected in the coming
months.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 IF YOU LIKE PREDICTION MARKETS YOU SHOULD LEARN ABOUT FUTARCHY (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Futarchy is a governance model that combines democratic voting on
desired outcomes with prediction markets to determine which policies
are most likely to achieve those goals, following the principle "vote
on values, bet on beliefs." Traditional democracy aggregates
preferences but not knowledge since being wrong carries no cost and
policies are chosen by popularity rather than accuracy, while
prediction markets require participants to risk capital and reward
correct predictions. Citizens would vote on outcomes they care about,
like GDP growth or employment levels, then prediction markets would
compete to identify which specific policies are most likely to deliver
those results, creating real-time probabilities based on collective
intelligence rather than ideology. Crypto infrastructure now enables
futarchy to be tested at scale through open participation, transparent
settlement, and programmable incentives, with DAOs already
experimenting with prediction market governance for resource
allocation and policy evaluation. 

 THE THREE-LAYER BANK SCAM (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Saving in banks is a “three-layer scam.” First, banks pocket
risk-free treasury yields instead of passing them to savers, while
lobbying to block stablecoin yields. Second, “real” yield
disappears once inflation and taxes are factored in, leaving
depositors worse off. Third, the dollar itself is an inflationary
asset, eroding long-term value relative to scarce assets like BTC,
ETH, and gold. Keep dollars for short-term needs, treasuries for
medium-term, and scarce assets for long-term wealth preservation.

 SOLANA'S PROPRIETARY AMM REVOLUTION (24 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Solana has witnessed the emergence of proprietary AMMs, a new
market-making primitive that embeds trading strategies directly
onchain rather than relying on off-chain execution, with daily volumes
consistently exceeding $1 billion and capturing over 60% of SOL/USDC
trading volume. These venues, operated by professional market makers
like SolFi, Tessera, and HumidiFi, provide "active liquidity" through
continuously adjusted pricing strategies anchored to oracle feeds,
fundamentally differing from traditional "passive liquidity" models of
constant-product DEXs. The model is uniquely enabled by Solana's
structural advantages, including high retail participation, low-cost
oracle updates, and Jupiter's aggregator dominance, which provides
single-integration access to non-toxic retail order flow. 

 RETHINKING TOKEN SUPPLY (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Outstanding Supply is a new token supply metric that mirrors
Outstanding Shares on the stock market to fix inconsistencies in
crypto valuations. It offers a clearer picture of true market cap
versus FDV (overstated) or Circulating Supply (inconsistent). The
framework also refines Circulating Supply into a smarter version that
excludes locked or insider tokens, giving investors apples-to-apples
comparability, transparency, and more accurate valuation multiples.
Outstanding Supply equals Total Supply minus Protocol Holdings.
