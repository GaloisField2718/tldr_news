 AI-POWERED ETHEREUM: FROM RULES-BASED TO AI-POWERED SMART CONTRACTS
(7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Eternal AI has introduced a framework for AI-powered Ethereum smart
contracts that replaces traditional rule-based programming with

The system operates across four layers (User, Kernel, Model, and
Hardware spaces) using a novel Proof-of-Compute consensus mechanism.
Eternal allows for autonomous agents, intelligent wallets, and
AI-powered oracles. Developers can now integrate open-source AI models
like Llama and FLUX directly into smart contracts for adaptive
learning and real-time decision-making capabilities for apps.

 THE CASE FOR DISTRIBUTED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (6 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Major tech companies are investing massive sums of money in
centralized AI infrastructure. They face issues with sub-80% GPU
utilization, massive power requirements (2-3GW per facility), and
extended GPU waitlists. A distributed AI model similar to crypto
networks could help the technology break free from centralized
mega-facilities. Ethereum's peak computing power exceeded all AI
companies combined. 

 A PRODUCT LINE APPROACH TO GROW LIDO'S STAKING ECOSYSTEM (10 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 A proposal for Lido DAO suggests adapting to the evolving Ethereum

like saturation in the liquid staking category and centralization
risks from institutional inflows. Lido aims to position itself as the
leading decentralized staking provider by catering to diverse user
needs while maintaining its core values of security, decentralization,
and alignment with Ethereum's principles.
