LEDGER DEFENDS CRYPTO WALLET RECOVERY TOOL AGAINST HOSTILE REACTION
FROM SECURITY EXPERTS (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theblock.co/post/230992/ledger-defends-crypto-wallet-recovery-tool?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Ledger's new recovery tool, Ledger Recover, which allows encrypted
shards of a user's seed phrase to be sent to third parties for
recovery, has sparked concerns among users and security experts.
Critics fear that the shards could be reconstructed by the companies
receiving them, exposing the keys. Ledger, however, insists that the
decryption can only happen on the user's device after identity
verification. The Paris-based company plans to charge $9.99 a month
for the service, which will initially be available in the US, UK, EU,
and Canada. 

SEC RESPONDS TO COINBASE REQUEST FOR ACTION: â€˜NOâ€™ (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://blockworks.co/news/sec-responds-to-coinbase-request-for-action-no?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


The SEC has responded to Coinbase's recent demands for clear crypto
industry regulations, stating that Coinbase does not have the right to
dictate the SEC's timeline for action. The SEC argues that
deliberation over significant changes, like those requested by
Coinbase, requires time, especially considering the Commissionâ€™s
active regulatory and enforcement agenda. Coinbase filed their suit in
response to a Wells Notice received in March, related to the
exchange's Wallet and Prime services. The SEC contends that Coinbase's
desire for immediate action does not entitle it to special relief.

FLASHBOTS IS NOW OFFERING ITS USERS FRONTRUNNING PROTECTION (2 MINUTE
READ)
[https://blockworks.co/news/flashbots-frontrunning-protection?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Flashbots, the leading MEV research shop, has launched a new service
aimed helping wallet and dapp users avoid being frontrun by MEV bots.
The tool, Flashbots Protect, offers front-running protection by
allowing users to send their transactions privately to miners,
bypassing the public mempool. Users can implement this by changing
their wallet's RPC settings. The team is also working on projects for
improved inclusion rates, more efficient MEV payments, and enhanced
transaction privacy. 

THE FIRST FULLY-AUDITED AND PERMISSIONLESS ERC-20 PAYMASTER IN THE
ECOSYSTEM (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1658597090409209859.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Pimlico has introduced its fully-audited and permissionless ERC-20
Paymaster. This new tool allows users to pay for transaction fees
purely in ERC-20 tokens like USDC, without intermediaries. The
Paymaster sponsors gas fees for a user operation if the smart contract
wallet reimburses the Paymaster in an ERC-20 token. The Paymaster is
entirely open-source and audited, ensuring it's safe and transparent.
It supports any token on any EVM chains with Chainlink support. In
addition, a comprehensive guide and a Typescript SDK are available to
help users and developers implement this solution.

COMPARING MODULAR BLOCKCHAINS (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1657037245931569152.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This thread compares the architectures of different modular
blockchains including Polygon, Avalanche, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Besu,
exploring different components such as consensus mechanisms, validator
admission, computational throughput, transaction latency, costs,
network topology, governance, developability, shared security,
interoperability, and tokenomics. It highlights the strengths and
weaknesses of each platform, including unique features like Polygon's
batching for lower gas costs, Polkadot's hierarchical security model,
and Avalanche's subnet level security. It also notes differences in
governance models, interoperability with EVM-compatible networks, and
the use of different tokens for securing networks and transactions. 

THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO ZKML ECOSYSTEM LANDSCAPE (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1658087354773671936.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This thread provides an in-depth look at the Zero-Knowledge Machine
Learning ecosystem. ZKML solutions, bolstered by blockchain, may
address trust issues in machine learning inferences. The ZKML
landscape can be broken down into seven categories: Hardware
Acceleration, Data Input, Inference, Decentralized Training,
Computation, Tooling, and Use Cases. Companies like Cysic, Ulvetanna,
and Ingo are building hardware to accelerate proof generation. Others
like Gensyn and FedML are focusing on decentralized training networks.
The thread also highlights use cases such as Worldcoin's
privacy-preserving models and ModulusLab's on-chain AI trading bot,
RockyBot.

As was reported last year, Michael Lewis is releasing a book about the

largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Titled "Going Infinite: The Rise and
Fall of a New Tycoon," the book recounts how Lewis, initially
introduced to Bankman-Fried by a friend, became an observer of an
unfolding scandal. FTX faced a spectacular collapse, with
Bankman-Fried accused of money laundering, bribery, and fraudulent
schemes. Lewis, having shadowed Bankman-Fried for about a year,
captured the unfolding events. The book is due to release on October
3.

[https://decrypt.co/138158/hong-kongs-crypto-licensing-regime-expected-launch-next-month?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Hong Kong is set to launch a crypto licensing regime next month,
aiming to become a leading crypto hub. The Securities and Futures
Commission will release final guidelines for crypto exchanges in May.

process. Currently, investors with portfolios under $1 million face
restrictions in trading. The SFC is also exploring other digital asset
applications, including a central bank digital currency.
