 FAST FORWARD: BUILDING CONSUMER AT INTERNET SPEED (12 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 It can be challenging to build consumer apps that keep pace with the
speed of innovation in the digital world. Current platforms often
isolate users by feeding individualized content, promoting a
dependence on algorithms. This generates a few issues: enforced narrow
platform rules affecting creators, culture adhering to trends, and
diminished social interaction. Future platforms should consider
designing seamless online and offline experiences, incorporate
decentralized reputation and curation, and account for rapid changes
in trends of consumption. 

 SOME THOUGHTS ON AI X CRYPTO (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The market cap of AI-related stocks has ballooned over the last
couple of years, with some single companies being valued more highly
than some sizable countries‚Äô GDPs. AI is still only a tiny portion
of crypto's total market cap. The share of market cap for AI-related
cryptocurrencies will grow substantially as AI will become a crucial
aspect of life by 2030. Crypto‚Äôs role in AI diverges from
traditional AI companies due to its emphasis on self-governance,
anti-censorship, and overall uniqueness compared to traditional forms
of operation.
