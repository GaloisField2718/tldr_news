MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINDCX DISMISSES REPORT OF COINBASE ACQUISITION TALKS (5 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 CoinDCX's CEO Sumit Gupta flatly denied reports that Coinbase is in
advanced talks to acquire the Indian exchange, reiterating that the
company remains “super focused” on building for India's crypto
market. A report from Mint had suggested Coinbase might value CoinDCX
at under $1 billion, down sharply from its $2.2 billion 2021
valuation, and noted Coinbase already holds equity in CoinDCX and
rival CoinSwitch. Coinbase declined to comment on the rumor, pointing
only to its broader mission and ongoing global exploration of build,
buy, partner, and invest opportunities. 

 BITMINE APPROVES $1B STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 BitMine, now focused on becoming a major Ethereum treasury, approved
a $1 billion stock repurchase program while disclosing 625,000 ETH
($2.4B) and 192 BTC in reserves. Chair Tom Lee said buying back shares
may offer a better return than ETH in pursuit of the firm's goal to
stake 5% of the ETH supply. BitMine's NAV per share stands at $22.76,
and it now ranks among the top publicly listed ETH-holding firms.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 KRAKEN TO INTEGRATE INK TOKEN AND INK NETWORK INTO 'CORE PRODUCT
SUITE' (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Kraken will integrate the INK token and Ink Layer 2 into its core
product suite for all global clients, including via the Kraken Drops
airdrop program. The Ink Foundation designed INK to drive network
utility rather than governance control. By embedding Ink-native
protocols, Kraken aims to bridge CeFi and DeFi, aligning onchain and
off‑chain infrastructure and standardizing value movement across its
trading and payment systems. Its first use case for INK will be an
Aave liquidity pool on Ink that offers concentrated liquidity as a
foundational DeFi building block. 

 LINEA UNVEILS NATIVE ETH YIELD BEFORE TOKEN ROLLOUT (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Linea, the Consensys-backed Ethereum L2, will introduce native ETH
staking, a protocol-level ETH burn (20% of fees), and a deflationary
LINEA token that burns 80% of fees. 85% of the token supply will go to
the ecosystem, 10% for early users, and 75% via a 10-year
Ethereum-aligned fund managed by a consortium including Consensys,
Eigen Labs, ENS Labs, and SharpLink. The fund launches on Ethereum's
10th anniversary, aiming to make Linea a core institutional and
community layer for ETH capital.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HYPERLIQUID VALUATION FRAMEWORK (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Using a conservative $3 million/day revenue base case and adjusting
for recurring stock‑based compensation, Hyperliquid trades at
attractive multiples versus public peers. A projected bull scenario of
capturing 25% of the perps market could drive fees to
$15 million/day, supported by Hyperliquid's superior
free‑cash‑flow margins, lean 12‑person team, and $300 million
in TradFi dry powder via SONN. Distribution remains a bottleneck with
only 153k holders, but partnerships like Phantom Perps and builder
codes, upcoming fiat on‑ramps, HIP‑3 sinks, spot‑collateral
perps, and new listings promise to broaden access. 

 COINBASE BETS ON STABLECOINS AND AI TO TRANSFORM E-COMMERCE (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Coinbase VP Shan Aggarwal argues that stablecoins will serve as the
native payment rails for autonomous AI agents, ushering in a new era
of agentic commerce where bots and humans transact seamlessly. To
capture this opportunity, Coinbase is building infrastructure like
x402 and AgentKit to enable AI-driven wallets to hold, send, and
receive stablecoins around the clock. By pairing stablecoin rails with
self‑custodial wallets, the exchange aims to replace legacy credit
and debit networks and unlock digital commerce for billions,
especially in underserved markets. Through ecosystem integration and
backing of crypto‑AI startups via Coinbase Ventures, the company is
positioning itself as the default platform for the emerging
machine‑economy.

 STABLE: A DIGITAL NATION OF USDT, BY USDT, FOR USDT (60 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Viewing blockchains as “digital nations,” USDT is already a
dominant reserve currency, yet it operates on chains not purposely
built for it. Stable has proposed an L1 expressly optimized for USDT,
with account‑abstraction allowing users to pay gas with USDT0,
fee-free transfers, and enterprise features such as
guaranteed blockspace, Transfer Aggregator, and confidential ZK
payments for remittances, payments, and DeFi. 

 STABLECOINS DO CREATE CREDIT, JUST NOT LIKE BANKS (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Stablecoins, such as Circle's USDC, actively create credit through
their reserves, including treasuries (loans to the government), repos
(secured loans to financial institutions), and bank deposits (loans to
banks). This structure qualifies as credit creation, even without
fractional lending. Banks account for just 20% of U.S. credit, with
trillions more generated through money market funds and securitized
debt like MBS. Narrow-bank stablecoins are less prone to runs, need no
bailouts, and offer safer intermediation, making them a financial
upgrade, not a threat.
