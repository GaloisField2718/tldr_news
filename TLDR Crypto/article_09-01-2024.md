would dramatically expand the investor base for the asset and attract
large inflows. Multiple issuers have revealed the fees they plan to
charge investors.

 FISCAL AND MONETARY DIVERGENCE (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post discusses the divergence between U.S. fiscal and monetary
policies and their impact on different parts of the economy. In recent
years, the U.S. experienced a shift from monetary to fiscal dominance,
impacting inflation, bond markets, and liquidity. The Fed's aggressive
rate hikes to combat inflation contrasted with the Treasury's
liquidity-boosting measures, leading to a complex macroeconomic
environment. These actions affected financial markets and the broader
economy, highlighting the significant impact of centralized fiscal and
monetary policies. This divergence is expected to continue, with
fiscal policy likely remaining dominant in the 2020s and 2030s,
influencing U.S. GDP growth and the performance of various asset
classes, including crypto. 

 RETHINKING LIGHTNING (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Bitcoin community's enthusiasm for the Lightning Network has
waned due to its complexity and reliance on custodial wallets. The
Lightning Network faces key issues like channel liquidity and the
inability to receive challenges offline. Mutiny Wallet aims to improve
this by integrating fedimint technology, offering a more
user-friendly, self-custodial solution that can dynamically share
ownership of UTXOs and interoperate with Lightning. It represents the
current best approach to scaling Bitcoin.
