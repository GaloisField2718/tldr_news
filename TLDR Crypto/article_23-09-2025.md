 CHINA ASKS BROKERS TO PAUSE RWA TOKENIZATION IN HONG KONG (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 China's securities regulator (CSRC) has informally advised some
domestic brokerages to halt their real-world asset (RWA) tokenization
business in Hong Kong, citing risk management concerns. The move comes
as Hong Kong positions itself as a global hub for digital assets, with
77 firms expressing interest in stablecoin licenses, even while
Beijing maintains a cautious stance. The CSRC's pause reflects worries
about firms making claims without sufficiently strong backing, amid a
booming RWA market that could reach $2 trillion by 2030. 

 UNREPORTED ATTACK ON CRYPTO.COM LEAKED USERS' PERSONAL DATA (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A teenage hacker named Noah Urban from the cybercriminal gang
Scattered Spider, along with an accomplice called Jack, successfully
gained access to a Crypto.com employee account through phishing
attacks targeting telecommunications, technology, and cryptocurrency
company staff. The breach occurred before March 2023, when Urban was
targeted in an FBI raid that seized $4 million worth of cryptocurrency
plus hundreds of thousands in cash and jewelry. Urban was later
arrested in January 2024 and sentenced to 10 years in prison after
pleading guilty to involvement in hacks of 13 companies. Crypto.com
confirmed to Bloomberg that the breach affected "a very small number
of individuals" with no customer funds accessed. Blockchain sleuth
ZachXBT criticized the exchange for failing to disclose the breach and
noted that it has been breached several times.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PLASMA ONE: THE APP FOR YOUR MONEY (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Plasma One is a stablecoin-native neobank and card that addresses the
friction in current stablecoin usage, where people globally rely on
generic crypto wallets and struggle with cash conversion. Targeting
markets like Istanbul, Buenos Aires, and Dubai, where exporters, store
owners, and traders use USDT for trusted currency access, the
application offers spending directly from stablecoin balances while
earning 10%+ yields, up to 4% cash back rewards, borderless coverage
across 150+ countries and 150 million merchants, zero-fee USDT
transfers, and fast onboarding with virtual cards available in
minutes. Plasma One serves a dual purpose as both a distribution
mechanism to provide financial inclusion for underserved markets and
as a testing ground for Plasma's onchain payments infrastructure. It
will allow the team to iterate quickly and prove their technology
under real demand before offering it to external institutions and
developers.

IP and allow for derivative video creation, fan-led content, and
transparent revenue sharing.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 PREDICTION MARKETS, EXPLAINED SIMPLY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Prediction markets like Polymarket let users bet on real-world
events, from elections to crypto prices, and earn if their predictions
are right. Built on blockchains like Polygon, they're decentralized
(no single company controls funds), transparent (all bets are
on-chain), and easy to access using stablecoins like USDC. Smart
contracts handle payouts automatically, while oracles feed real-world
data to settle outcomes, making them a fast-growing onchain use case. 

 MARKETS RECEIVE RISK-ON SIGNAL (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Federal Reserve's 25 basis point rate cut, accompanied by
guidance for further easing, has bolstered risk-on sentiment and
created a supportive environment for risk assets in the near term
through this dovish monetary policy stance. Digital Asset Trusts are
showing signs of mid-to-late cycle maturation as market Net Asset
Values compress and confidence wavers despite new product launches,
indicating that premiums are increasingly dependent on overall market
momentum rather than fundamental value propositions. Ethereum is
experiencing improved demand dynamics coupled with constrained
sellable supply, as the Kiln-driven exit queue is temporarily trapping
staked ETH and creating long-biased positioning in the market. The
potential introduction of a Base token is under consideration, which
could have significant implications for the Coinbase L2 ecosystem and
broader market dynamics.

 SOL TRADING BOTS LOSE $96M IN 6 WEEKS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Trading bot wallets on Solana have reduced their SOL holdings by 435K
tokens (~$96M) over the past six weeks, marking a 24.6% decline. The
sharpest drop came from Axiom, down to 390K SOL, while Photon and GMGN
also saw significant decreases. This shift suggests bots may be
deleveraging or reallocating capital, raising questions about
liquidity dynamics in Solana's high-frequency trading ecosystem. 

 THE NEXT BIG CATEGORY: NEW WAYS TO EARN ONLINE (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 New college graduates are struggling to find traditional entry-level
jobs as AI encroaches on sophisticated positions earlier than
expected, creating more free time and a greater desire for creative
monetization methods, including increased financial market
participation, entertainment financialization, and expanded online
creation opportunities. Crypto provides optimal infrastructure for
these emerging earning models through inexpensive global money rails
that create near-limitless customer reach, with anyone able to build
and earn using just a wallet and internet connection, regardless of
age or location. Companies like Zora enable creator monetization
tools, Remix helps gamers create and distribute monetizable games, and
The Clearing Co expands tradable market options, demonstrating the
wide-open design space for products helping people earn online through
content, ideas, investments, and entertainment.
