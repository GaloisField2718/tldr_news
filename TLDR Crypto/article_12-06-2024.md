INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SYMBIOTIC: PERMISSIONLESS, FLEXIBLE RESTAKING (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Symbiotic is a restaking protocol that competes with EigenLayer and
Karak. It has launched its bootstrapping phase, onboarding ETH LSTs as
collateral. Its modular design supports any combination of tokens as
collateral, and immutable non-upgradable contracts remove governance
risks. Its initial partners, which include Ethena, Hyperlane, and
Lido, are building solutions alongside or on top of Symbiotic's
infrastructure. 

 FUSE: SOLANA'S FIRST SMART WALLET (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Solana has launched Fuse, a smart wallet designed to enhance the
mobile experience for individual users of Squads Protocol by
simplifying security measures and transaction processes. Fuse aims to
transform the concept of self-custodial wallets by leveraging smart
accounts for asset storage, offering a programmable platform that
enhances security and user experience with features like multi-factor
authentication and programmable spending limits.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WTF ARE FRAUD PROOFS? (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Optimism's introduction of fraud proofs means that bridged assets can
be withdrawn without Optimism's approval and anyone can review and
challenge OP Mainnet transactions. Previously, the Ethereum settlement
layer had to trust Optimism's transaction history without proving it.
Looking forward, other OP Stack chains like Base and Mantle should be
able to implement fraud proofs and become Stage 1 L2s much quicker. 

 BTC MINER SENTIMENT THREAD (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread compiles various tweets that are bullish on the Bitcoin
mining sector. They cite concerns surrounding capital expenditures,
competition, and the environmental impact. Marathon, the biggest
mining company, has 25% short interest as a percentage of its float.
CleanSpark has been seeing insider selling since the beginning of this
year.

would simplify development but limit staking options.
