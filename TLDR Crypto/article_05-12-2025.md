MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO MARKETS HOLD GAINS AS BITCOIN TRADES ABOVE $92K (4 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin stabilized above $92,000 as Ethereum led top-20 gains at
3.4%. $732 billion in new capital was added this cycle. 1-year
realized volatility nearly halved, suggesting a "calmer, larger and
more institutional" environment. Over 25% of BTC supply remains
underwater as spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $14.9 million outflows,
breaking a five-day streak. Liquidations totaled $282 million, with
shorts accounting for $201 million as traders position ahead of the
Fed's expected December 10 rate cut and digest jobless claims falling
to 191,000. 

 MONEYGRAM TEAMS UP WITH FIREBLOCKS TO EXPAND STABLECOIN PAYMENTS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 MoneyGram partnered with Fireblocks to power stablecoin payments and
cross-border settlements across its 200+ country network, reducing
pre-funding requirements and enabling real-time treasury operations
through multi-blockchain stablecoin transfers. The integration allows
near-instant digital wallet arrivals for recipients using USDC while
MoneyGram reconciles payments faster on the backend, reducing friction
from local banking systems and capital requirements. Fireblocks, which
has secured over $5 trillion in annual digital asset transfers, will
act as the programmable layer routing value across chains and
jurisdictions.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHVAL V0.4.3: TRACKING FUSAKA'S SUPPLY EXPERIMENT (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 ETHval just shipped a “Supply Dynamics” dashboard to watch what
Fusaka does to ETH inflation/deflation in real time. Fusaka boosts
Ethereum's gas limit from 36M to 60M and massively expands blob
capacity, so fees per transaction should fall at first. It is still
debated whether cheaper blockspace makes ETH inflationary (because
burn drops), or whether it pulls in so much extra activity that total
burn still beats issuance, and ETH stays scarce. ETHval now surfaces
gas utilization, daily burn/issuance, net supply, base fee, blob
activity, and TVL so you can see which way the experiment goes. 

 BASE LAUNCHES BRIDGE TO SOLANA (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Base launched a bridge to Solana, powered by Chainlink's Cross-Chain
Interoperability Protocol, enabling native SPL token support in Base
apps and bidirectional asset transfers verified by Coinbase and
Chainlink node operators. The integration advances Base's goal to
serve as a hub for the "everything economy" where users can trade and
use assets across chains regardless of their starting network.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 TETHER IN 2025: A CAPITAL ANALYSIS (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tether is like an unregulated bank rather than a simple money
transmitter. Depending mostly on how harshly you treat BTC, Tether's
total capital ratio ranges from ~10.9% (OK vs minimal regulatory
standards) down to ~3.9% (bad vs market norms). Group-level profits
and equity look big, but most sit outside the actual reserve entity
and aren't legally committed to back USDT redemptions, so they can't
be counted as true regulatory capital. 

 WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU SUBMIT A TRANSACTION (8 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Ethereum transaction processing moved from validators building their
own blocks to specialized block builders dominating the process
through MEV-Boost relays that auction optimally-ordered blocks to
validators selecting the most profitable bids. Transactions propagate
through decentralized mempools where each node maintains local
versions and compete on fees rather than arrival time, with wallets
signing and broadcasting via RPC nodes like Alchemy before builders
bundle transactions to capture MEV opportunities. Confirmation arrives
after one 12-second slot when the majority attests the block, while
finalization requires 12.8 minutes, providing cryptographic permanence
that requires one-third of staked ETH to reverse.

 PEERDAS: HOW FUSAKA MAKES L2S CHEAPER (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Fusaka's main feature, PeerDAS, changes how Ethereum stores blob
data. Instead of every node keeping full copies of each blob, nodes
only store a small slice of every blob while still being able to
verify that the full data exists. That means the network can safely
handle many more blobs per block, which lowers data-availability costs
for rollups. More blobs per block means cheaper L2 data and cheaper L2
transactions for users. 

 CAN L1S COMPETE WITH BTC AS MONEY? (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Most of crypto's value is really a bet on “cryptomoney”, BTC plus
L1 tokens that the market hopes can act like money one day. When you
strip out TRON/Hyperliquid, L1 revenues have fallen, while their
price-to-sales multiples have exploded (40x to 500x+), meaning
valuations are being driven far more by monetary premium than by cash
flows. Against that standard, almost all major L1s have underperformed
BTC since late 2022. Even Solana, whose fundamentals went from 20 to
30x, only managed an 87% outperformance (at one point) versus BTC.
BTC's claim as cryptomoney is strengthening while the “maybe we'll
be money later” story for most L1s is quietly breaking.

 EF PROTOCOL TEAM'S PRIORITIES (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Ethereum Foundation protocol team shipped production-ready Open
Intents Framework, EIL trustless crosschain infrastructure,
interoperable chain-specific addresses, and Fast Confirmation Rule,
reducing confirmation times to one slot while targeting sub-10-second
economic finality and optimistic rollup withdrawal windows shortened
from seven days to 1-2 days, then one hour. 

 BINANCE JUNIOR (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Binance has released a new account type for kids, allowing parents to
set up specific permissions and monitoring while giving their children
