MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC HAS NOW OFFICIALLY DROPPED ITS INQUIRY INTO IMMUTABLE (1 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The SEC has officially dropped its inquiry into Immutable without
taking enforcement action, marking a major victory for web3 gaming and
digital ownership rights. Despite the investigation, Immutable
continued to expand, launching zkEVM, growing its user base, and
securing major partnerships—now, it's ready to accelerate further. 

 GAMESTOP TO ADD BITCOIN TO BALANCE SHEET (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 GameStop has announced plans to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve
asset after a unanimous board vote. The company has nearly $5 billion
in cash in its treasury, though the amount to be allocated to Bitcoin
has not yet been determined. Speculation that GameStop would make this
decision started after a picture surfaced of CEO Ryan Cohen and
MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor at Trump's Mar-a-Lago. GME shares are
up nearly 6% on the news in after-hours trading.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

buy and sell over 100 tokenized stocks, ETFs, and REITs (fully backed
1:1 by real securities through its partner Dinari). It is set to
release fiat offramps in multiple currencies and native mobile apps

 DERIVATIVES TRADING GIANT CME GROUP TO TEST TOKENIZATION WITH GOOGLE
CLOUD (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 CME Group is partnering with Google Cloud to test asset tokenization
on Cloud's new Universal Ledger, a private programmable network. This
initiative will begin testing later this year, with new digital asset
services expected to launch in 2026. Tokenization offers
around-the-clock settlements at a much faster rate than traditional
rails. It is positioned to become a multi-trillion dollar industry
according to several analysts.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHY AI BUILDERS SHOULD BUILD ON CRYPTO RAILS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI is rapidly improving yet simultaneously becoming commoditized.
Developers must embrace network effects if they want to build lasting
businesses. Blockchains and tokens enable network effects to be
bootstrapped by incentivizing user contributions in exchange for
ownership and driving attention to products. In the future, fully
sovereign agents can use tokens to build a business from scratch. 

 COINBASE DEVELOPER AFFILIATE PROGRAM NOW LIVE ON FUUL (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 The CDP Affiliate Program, now live via Fuul, offers ETH rewards for
referring developers to build with the Coinbase Developer Platform.
Affiliates earn $300 for their first active referral and $50 per
active developer each week (up to $500/week). Referred developers can
also earn up to $65 for onboarding and making qualifying API calls,
with no limit on how many devs you can refer.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STOP BEING AN IDIOT ABOUT L1/L2S (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There is no tangible end-user difference between L1s and L2s, as both
require bootstrapped liquidity through stablecoins and non-native
assets. L2s function as execution layers with trust-minimized bridges.
They naturally integrate with L1s and other L2s despite concerns
around liquidity fragmentation. Though L1s benefit from a token
flywheel driving demand among MEV searchers and stakers, L2s need to
rework their tokenomics to capture similar value and provide more than
governance rights. L2 development must shift in operational mindset
and token design to ensure robust economic incentives for holders. 

 HYPERLIQUID ALLEGEDLY ON TRACK TO BECOME FTX 2.0 (1 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Hyperliquid's response to the $JELLY incident (shutting down the
market and forcibly settling positions at a favorable price) has been
labeled unethical and damaging, raising concerns about the
decentralized exchange's integrity. Although it markets itself as a
DEX, Hyperliquid's lack of KYC/AML, offshore-style operations, and
flawed design choices like mixed vaults and unlimited position sizes
have led critics to warn it may be on track to repeat an FTX-style
collapse.
