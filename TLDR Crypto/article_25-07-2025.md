MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO INDUSTRY ASKS TO STOP JPMORGAN'S TAX ON DATA ACCESS (7 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Ten fintech and crypto trade groups asked President Trump to stop
JPMorgan from charging aggregators for consumer banking data access,
calling it a “punitive tax” that could debank millions and slow
stablecoin and self-custody wallet adoption. JPMorgan's fees could run
~$300M annually, or 75% of revenue, for Plaid, jeopardizing how users
fund exchanges and wallets via services like Plaid and MX. The dispute
centers on the CFPB's Rule 1033, which mandates free access to
consumer data. Industry leaders, including Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi,
warn this shift risks re-centralizing data access, arguing crypto
offers an alternative. 

 BITMINE DOUBLES ETH HOLDINGS TO $2B, LEADS CORPORATE TREASURY RACE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 BitMine Immersion now has more than 566,000 ETH (~$2.04B), making it
the largest publicly traded Ethereum treasury holder. Backed by Peter
Thiel's Founders Fund and Ark Invest, the firm's aggressive
accumulation, aiming to control 5% of total supply, added ~$1B in ETH
in just 10 days. This move escalates the corporate ETH arms race,
outpacing SharpLink and fueling projections of a $20B institutional
wave into Ethereum via treasuries and ETFs.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ENDGAME: HOW WE USE ZK TO SECURE MEGAETH (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Optimistic rollups hinge on fraud proofs, but today's interactive
bisection games are slow, costly, and vulnerable to griefing. MegaETH
replaces that with non‑interactive ZK fraud proofs: a challenger
submits a single zkVM proof that the proposed state is invalid, $100
only when fraud exists. The chain keeps a 7‑day detection window,
yet once challenged, finality is restored in ~1 hour, and dishonest
sequencers are slashed, eliminating stall attacks. EigenDA supplies
the data needed to reconstruct blocks, ensuring anyone can verify and
generate proofs, strengthening an efficient, scalable, onchain
security model. 

 BINANCE INTEGRATES CIRCLE'S USYC AS YIELD-BEARING COLLATERAL (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Binance has integrated Circle's tokenized money market fund, USYC, as
off-exchange collateral for institutional derivatives trading,
deepening the partnership between two of crypto's biggest players.
USYC, comparable to BlackRock's BUIDL, offers yield exposure to U.S.
Treasurys and near-instant convertibility with USDC, making it a
capital-efficient bridge between tokenized dollars and real-world
assets. The integration, which includes native issuance on BNB Chain,
marks a major move for Circle's RWA strategy and comes shortly after
its IPO and acquisition of tokenization startup Hashnote.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 PANTERA BLOCKCHAIN LETTER: JULY 2025 (45 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tokenization has shifted from concept to inevitability this year,
with over $24B in RWAs sitting on public chains with ~200 issuers
including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Siemens, and J.P. Morgan.
Liquidity is migrating to programmable rails – Figure has processed
$13B onchain, Ondo issued $1B in tokenized Treasuries and is adding
equities, Robinhood's Stock Tokens were added on Arbitrum, and
Coinbase's Base show fintechs racing to own sequencers and
infrastructure. Most assets still grant transferability but not full
shareholder rights, setting up a fight over governance and ownership.
The tipping point will be when daily onchain equity volume tops $1B or
tokenized equity AUM hits $100B. Regulatory clarity, app-specific
chains, UX/compliance abstraction, and portable KYC layers are the
catalysts for onchain becoming the default venue for capital
formation, price discovery, and settlement. 

 MOST DAOS DON'T WORK (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most DAOs falter because they lack clear goals, aligned incentives,
and functional hierarchy. Token rewards and airdrops often optimize
for short‑term or legal risk offloading rather than sustainable
governance. For example, Compound drifted into mere treasury
management after costly, low-delivery hires, while Aave retained
strong team leadership, implemented revenue sharing/buybacks, and kept
execution tight, and Lido's dual governance lets stETH holders
delay/veto proposals at 1%/10% thresholds. Uniswap's split between
DAO, Foundation, and Labs enabled $145M in UNI spending and triggered
a delegate resignation, and Arbitrum's hybrid model funds outside
managers as Offchain Labs' Timeboost has already sent $2M+ to the
treasury. Emerging “BORGs” mix legal entities with automated,
onchain processes, emphasizing the broader point that decentralization
should be applied where it fits, not by default.

 FELIX: DUBIOUS SPECULATION (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Felix's weekly points program currently awards ~2.5–2.8k USD per
point, translating to an estimated 21-40% APY on the capital deployed,
depending on assumptions around total point inflation and airdrop
share. Even conservative models (<20% airdrop over 20 weeks) imply
~$11/point and a $120M token distribution, while more realistic
scenarios (30% airdrop over 15 weeks) push that to ~$21/point and
~$180M total. Latecomer users farming ~94 points/week could net
~$5.9k–$8.8k in airdrops on a $60k position, before accounting for
lending yields or referrals. Smaller portfolios (< $20k) may find the
entry cost too high, but larger holders can lock in attractive yields
and leverage Felix's broad integration with HyperEVM protocols. 

 LAYER3: THE FINAL PIECE IN WEB3 MASS ADOPTION (40 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Layer3 positions itself as the “Google + Duolingo” of Web3 by
solving discovery and onboarding through narrative quests and CUBE
NFTs that record onchain actions as portable reputation. Its $L3 token
underpins a burn-to-launch model for projects, helping drive $16.5M in
revenue split ~40%/60% between partners and users. Case studies like
Ondo (92% of $1.04M TVL retained) and Jito (70% assets retained after
a month) evidence high-quality engagement. Partnerships such as
Robinhood's RWA rollout showcase Layer3 as an onboarding and education
partner, while v3 evolves it into an “onchain OS” with a built-in
wallet and AI-driven campaign automation. The main risk is incentive
gaming, and ensuring CUBEs reflect genuine understanding rather than
optimized farming.
