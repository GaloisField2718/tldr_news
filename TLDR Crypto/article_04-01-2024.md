 MATRIXPORT FOUNDER SAYS DISSEMINATION OF BITCOIN ETF REPORT WAS
‚ÄòBEYOND OUR CONTROL‚Äô (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A report published by research firm Matrixport opining that the spot
bitcoin ETF applications in queue would be rejected was widely
disseminated by news outlets and caused widespread panic and massive
liquidations across the entire space. These were the largest
liquidation levels since the infamous ‚ÄúCointelegraph Intern‚Äù post
several months ago that caught short sellers offside. The founder of
Matrixport claimed that the dissemination of their analysis was
outside of the firm‚Äôs control and was simply an opinion by one of
the firm‚Äôs analysts.

MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Klaytn Foundation has introduced a gold-pegged cryptocurrency,
$GPC, and a supporting DeFi platform called Goldstation on its

CREDER, $GPC is presented as the first gold token offered on DeFi
outside Ethereum without percentage-based fees. The developers
highlight that the low gas fees enable individuals to more practically
make smaller investments in gold. Goldstation aims to start
operations, including $GPC staking, on January 24, initially targeting
South Korean clients.

 A GUIDE TO SIMPLE COSMOS STAKING FOR AIRDROPS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Airdrop farmers are expecting Dymension‚Äôs recently announced
airdrop to kickoff a full airdrop season for Cosmos. This post
provides a simple guide to potentially qualifying for these airdrops.
To maximize chances of qualifying, tokens should be staked with active
validators who participate in governance proposals, excluding
centralized exchange validators. Regular on-chain activity and voting
in governance proposals can also boost your chances. For larger
bankrolls, owning a Bad Kids NFT could potentially increase
eligibility for future drops as it did with the Dymension drop.

 THOUGHTS ON DIGITAL IDENTITY AND STATUS (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This post discusses how the digital revolution has profoundly changed
how we define and express identity, allowing for anonymous or
pseudo-anonymous entities to amass power, particularly in the realms
of crypto and online communities. The shift enables us to divide our
interests through multiple online identities, democratizes physical
constraints like geography, and necessitates a nuanced, active
approach to finding one's online community. While it brings more
opportunities, it also presents challenges, like alienation and
navigating the complexity of online groups.
