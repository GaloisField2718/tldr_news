INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PM-AMM: A UNIFORM AMM FOR PREDICTION MARKETS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The pm-AMM is a new type of automated market maker specifically
optimized for prediction markets where traditional outcome tokens
behave differently from other assets. By modeling these tokens with
"Gaussian score dynamics," the pm-AMM aims to deliver consistent
liquidity provider losses across prediction market scenarios with a
dynamic variant that adapts as market expiration approaches. 

 LAUNCHING DELEGATED ACTIONS ON PRIVY (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Privy has introduced “delegated actions,” a feature that allows
users to grant apps permission to perform specific on-chain actions on
their behalf, even when offline, improving the user experience in
self-custodial systems. This tool enables automated workflows like
executing limit orders or recurring transactions, with all actions
rooted in user consent and secured through Privy's key splitting
cryptosystem and secure enclaves.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 DELPHI DIGITAL'S AGENTIC ECONOMY REPORT TAKEAWAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [8]


 AI will make it easy for anyone to build innovative applications
using natural language. Web Proofs like zkTLS will make bridging web2
data to web3 incredibly easy and help the transition occur with less
friction for the end user. Gaming will be one of the most exciting use
cases, as AI agents will manage and operate within in-game economies.
As models improve and become more specialized, the applicability of AI
within crypto will increase exponentially. 

 LRT LIQUIDITY AND UTILIZATION UPDATES (JULY - OCTOBER) (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The latest LRT Liquidity and Utilization report highlights key
updates across top liquid restaking tokens (LRTs), with notable
developments in EigenLayer's incentivization programs and liquidity
trends in decentralized exchanges and lending protocols. Liquidity has
generally decreased, but lending protocols are absorbing more LRTs, a
trend expected to continue as restakers prioritize ETH rewards for
greater capital efficiency, especially as auto-compounding options
gain traction.

 THE AI AGENT REVOLUTION: 2 TRENDS YOU NEED TO KNOW (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 AI agents are evolving from pure personality-based agents like Truth
Terminal to hybrid personality-utility agents like Luna that can
perform onchain transactions. There has been an expansion from
single-channel to multi-channel presence across social media
platforms. Major AI platforms like Fetch.ai and Virtuals are
positioning for this transition, with 2025 projected as a pivotal year
for AI agent adoption across DeFi, strategy management, and social
media content creation. 

 ETHEREUM ROADMAP UNDER FIRE (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ethereum's roadmap, with key upgrades like EIP1559, Proof of Stake,
Shapella, and EIP4844, has had wide-ranging economic effects on
developers, validators, users, and token holders by impacting fees,
validator yields, and transaction costs. While these changes have
supported Ethereum's scalability, especially through increased L2
adoption, questions remain about whether the primary value will
continue to accrue at the L1 level or shift more significantly to L2
solutions.
