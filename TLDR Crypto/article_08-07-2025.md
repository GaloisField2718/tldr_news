MARKETS & BUSINESS

 STAND WITH CRYPTO BACKS CLARITY ACT (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Stand With Crypto, backed by Coinbase and joined by 65+
organizations, is urging the U.S. House to pass the Digital Asset
Market Clarity Act, which would define SEC and CFTC roles, mandate
disclosures, and provide long-awaited regulatory clarity. The bill
faces political friction tied to Trump's crypto ventures, with
lawmakers racing to finalize legislation before the September
deadline. 

 US APPEALS COURT BATTLE OVER TORNADO CASH ENDS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A US appeals court has granted a joint motion to vacate the lawsuit
over the 2022 sanctions against Tornado Cash following the
government's removal of those sanctions in March. Coin Center declared
the case officially over, with the government unwilling to defend its
broad interpretation of sanctions laws.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETH STRATEGY: LEVERAGED EXPOSURE TO ETHEREUM (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ETH Strategy is an autonomous onchain treasury protocol that mirrors
MicroStrategy's convertible debt model, allowing users to deposit
stablecoins in exchange for STRAT, a leveraged ETH token with no
liquidation risk. Leverage is provided through long-term bonds and
option NFTs, which fuel treasury growth only when real value enters
the system. Deposited ETH is put to work earning yield while STRAT
holders govern bond control, treasury allocations, and liquidity
incentives. The result is permissionless, composable DeFi-native
leverage designed for institutional-grade sustainability. 

 DETROIT PISTONS LAUNCH FAN REWARDS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Detroit Pistons have partnered with Uptop to launch Pistons
Rewards, a fan engagement program that lets users earn redeemable
points through linked card purchases, receipt uploads, game
predictions, and referrals. The program is built on Avalanche and uses
open banking and digital wallets.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THOUGHTS ON STABLECOIN BANKS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 One type of stablecoin bank would allow customers to automatically
earn T-bill yield on deposits, with bank activities being performed in
stablecoins but still providing the user with the expected banking
experience. A bank designed this way might prevent a threat to our
current banking system, since it would drive money from fractional
reserve banks or be a stablecoin not 1:1 backed with dollars. A
stablecoin created by a federally chartered bank that operates a
fractional reserve model can solve this problem and is starting to be
explored. 

 ROBINHOOD'S BIG TOKENIZATION PUSH (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 At EthCC, Robinhood unveiled its EVM-compatible “Robinhood Chain”
on Arbitrum Orbit, featuring a token engine that mints and burns
onchain wrappers for offchain-custodied equities. Users can trade
these stock tokens in-app or self-custody them in wallets, transfer
them onchain, and access 24/5 trading (eventually 24/7), leveraging
its Bitstamp acquisition for off-hours execution. By operating the
sequencer and owning the tokenized assets, Robinhood captures all
transaction fees and monetizes the full “tokenization stack,”
including offshore trading of private company share tokens for EU
users. The plan faces significant regulatory uncertainty, with open
questions about SEC approval, issuer consent, and SIFMA's objections
to off-market tokenized equity trading.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CRYPTO HAS NO SOUL (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Crypto faces a “missing soul” problem, marked by misaligned
priorities between people, products, and narratives that stem from a
pervasive lack of genuine care. True culture, and the loyalty it
fosters, emerges when projects respect shared history and build on
existing legacies rather than invent new myths. Vulnerability and
authenticity in human-to-human interactions infuse products with real
meaning, bridging divides between diverse subcultures. Absent these
deeper connections, crypto innovation remains fragmented and
transactional, lacking the enduring bonds that define lasting
movements. 

 STABLECOINS THREATEN VISA REVENUES (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Visa's Q4 2024 earnings highlight that cross-border volume (13–15%
YoY growth) remains a core business driver, especially outside
intra-Europe. When users transact abroad, like using an
Estonian-issued card in the U.S., Visa must route funds via costly
correspondent banking rails, adding surcharges (e.g., 1.5%). In
contrast, stablecoins are borderless by default, eliminating both the
need to move money across borders and the fees associated with it.
This presents a structural threat to legacy networks like Visa,
Mastercard, and PayPal, whose margins depend heavily on cross-border
volume.
