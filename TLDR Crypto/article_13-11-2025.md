MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE AND BVNK CALL OFF $2 BILLION ACQUISITION (6 MINUTE READ) [4]


 Coinbase terminated its $2 billion acquisition of UK stablecoin
payments firm BVNK after reaching due diligence and October
exclusivity. No reason has been disclosed for abandoning what would
have been nearly double Stripe's $1.1 billion Bridge deal that closed
in February. The collapse comes during intense stablecoin M&A
activity: Mastercard is pursuing Zerohash for $1.5-2 billion after
previously competing for BVNK, while Modern Treasury acquired Beam for
$40 million in October. 

 AERODROME EXPANDS BEYOND BASE TO ETHEREUM AND ARC (2 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Dromos Labs, the team behind Aerodrome (Base) and Velodrome
(Optimism), unveiled Aero, a unified liquidity hub expanding to
Ethereum Mainnet and Circle's Arc blockchain, merging both ecosystems
under a single AERO token with no dilution. The upgrade introduces
MetaDEX 03, a next-gen DEX operating system featuring a dual-engine
model that boosts revenue by 40%, cuts costs by $34M, and integrates
Slipstream V3 to capture MEV directly at the DEX level. With verified
pools, cross-chain Metaswaps, and AI-ready integrations, Aero aims to
become the core liquidity layer for the onchain economy across the
entire EVM ecosystem by Q2 2026.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SOFI LAUNCHES IN-APP CRYPTO TRADING (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SoFi is the first nationally chartered US bank to launch direct
in-app crypto trading for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, leveraging
its banking charter and 12.6 million users who already trust it with
checking and loans. The company has operated Lightning Network
remittances with Lightspark since August, targeting the $740 billion
global remittance market, where users send dollars that convert to
pesos using Bitcoin rails invisibly. SoFi plans to launch a
proprietary stablecoin by mid-2026, positioning crypto trading as a
complement to its remittance strategy rather than a standalone
product. 60% of crypto-owning members prefer licensed bank custody
over exchanges. 

 JPMORGAN LAUNCHES JPM COIN ON COINBASE'S BASE NETWORK (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 JPMorgan is rolling out JPM Coin on Coinbase's Ethereum L2, Base,
introducing a new class of interest-bearing deposit tokens backed by
bank funds. These tokens enable instant, 24/7 settlements and will be
accepted as collateral on Coinbase, following a successful pilot with
Mastercard and B2C2. Other major banks like BNY Mellon and HSBC are
pursuing similar products. This move underscores how Ethereum has
become the preferred settlement layer for global finance.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AERODROME'S BLITZSCALING (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Aerodrome's critics misunderstand token economics by ignoring
velocity. 49% of AERO supply is locked as veAERO, creating ~5.6% net
circulating inflation comparable to gold's 2-3% annual rate despite
higher gross emissions. The protocol generates $185M in annualized
revenue with zero cash burn since emissions are equity distribution
rather than expenses, mirroring Google's early stock-based
compensation strategy that showed accounting losses while preserving
cash. veAERO holders capture 100% of protocol revenue plus rebases
that offset dilution, while Aerodrome commands 60% DEX market share on
Base with $425M total revenue since launch and accumulation from
Coinbase, Circle, and Animoca Brands. 

 PUBLIC SALES ARE THE NEW AIRDROPS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Public ICOs have replaced airdrops as the dominant token launch
method after airdrop farming turned distribution events into exit
liquidity for sybil attackers. Projects are now raising hundreds of
millions at pre-launch valuations that still offer retail profitable
flips. PUMP raised $600M at $4B FDV while XPL presalers captured 6x
returns despite drawdowns, and upcoming launches MegaETH and Monad are
raising $50M at $900M FDV and $200M at $2.5B FDV, respectively, with
MegaETH oversubscribed 27.8x. This ICO surge redirects capital from
existing altcoin holders into new launches, creating a headwind for
high-FDV vaporware projects and accelerating dispersion between coins
with monetary premium or cashflow versus narrative-driven tokens.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MAJORS NEED TO LEAD BEFORE ALTCOINS FOLLOW (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Market positioning has reset following October's washout, but crypto
remains the worst-performing cross-asset class despite selective
altcoin strength in DePIN (+22%), L2s (+13%), and mid-caps (+15%),
driven by a weekend bounce. Bitcoin sits at $105k, 16% below all-time
highs, a range where historical data shows BTC outperforms alts 54% of
the time and explains why recent dinocoin rallies in FIL, ICP, and FET
quickly lost momentum. Supportive macro conditions, including rate
cuts and ended QT, haven't translated to broad crypto flows. The next
volatility drivers are expected to come from US regulatory and
political headlines rather than positioning shifts, as majors must
reclaim leadership before sustained altcoin breadth returns. 

 ETHEREUM DOMINATES STABLECOIN MARKET AS SOLANA SLIPS TO 4TH (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Ethereum's stablecoin market cap hit an all-time high of $167B,
cementing its position as the leading stablecoin ecosystem. Meanwhile,
Binance Smart Chain flipped Solana, pushing it to fourth place after a
$2B decline in circulating stables. With over 80% of non-centralized
stablecoin liquidity now on Ethereum L1 and L2 (Arbitrum and Base
holding $8B combined), capital is increasingly consolidating around
Ethereum's DeFi and payment infrastructure.

difference in security and maturity compared to the 2020 DeFi Summer
era. 

 SOLANA TRANSACTION CLAIMS DEBUNKED, ETHEREUM SCALING TO 1M+ TPS (1

 While Solana touts 3.1B lifetime transactions, much of that count
includes vote transactions, which inflate totals and distort
comparisons.
