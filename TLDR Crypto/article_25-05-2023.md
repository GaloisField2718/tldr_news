WHAT AN FTX REBOOT COULD LOOK LIKE ‚Äî AND IS IT EVEN VIABLE? (5
MINUTE READ)
[https://blockworks.co/news/ftx-reboot-is-it-viable?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


FTX is considering emerging from bankruptcy in a sort of reboot of the
exchange. The new CEO, John J. Ray III, is leading the restructuring
task force to explore the possibility of a relaunch. Industry experts
believe that a relaunch would be challenging due to the damage to
FTX's brand, technological issues, and the necessity to rebuild trust.
On the other hand, some crypto natives are speculating that it would
actually be easier to reboot than it might seem on the surface. FTX
already has name recognition and a broad user base that could be
tapped to reactivate under the right leadership. While the company has
recovered substantial assets, any plan to self-finance a relaunch
could pose a risk to creditors, necessitating additional investor or
lender support, so a decision on any relaunch plans is unlikely to
come sooner than mid-2024. 

APPLE, ANDROID COULD GET MOBILE VERSION OF WEB3 GAME GODS UNCHAINED (3
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theblock.co/post/232038/crypto-gods-unchained-eyes-2023-mobile-gaming-launch-apple-android?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Gods Unchained, a leading blockchain-based digital trading card game,
plans to launch a mobile version on Android and Apple platforms by the
end of the year. With significant traction having done over $160
million in volume already, the founders believe that, despite the
mobile gaming market being highly competitive, its large user base
offers significant potential for growth. They also acknowledge the
need to reduce friction points, such as the necessity for digital
wallets, to facilitate the mainstream adoption of blockchain gaming.
Alongside Axie and Stepn‚Äôs recent mobile moves, this is a big step
forward in seeing web3 games go mainstream.

F(X) PROTOCOL‚ÄôS TOKENOMICS & OFFER: A CALCULATED JOURNEY TOWARDS
SUCCESS (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://medium.com/@protocol_fx_667/f-x-protocols-tokenomics-offer-a-calculated-journey-towards-success-b97487df41b9?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


The f(x) Protocol, conceived by Aladdin DAO, is a DeFi solution
introducing a "floating stablecoin" known as fETH. Unlike traditional
stablecoins, fETH adjusts according to ETH‚Äôs price fluctuations,
achieving stability through a complementary asset, xETH, which absorbs
most ETH price volatility. The protocol's governance token, FX, allows
holders to participate in decision-making processes and offers
revenue-sharing benefits. The f(x) Protocol will launch in beta mode
before its full release. FX‚Äôs token distribution is designed to
avoid VC involvement or team allocation, and will occur through a
"capped elastic token offering." 

STRATEG - AN OMNICHAIN SOCIAL YIELD INFRASTRUCTURE (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://mirror.xyz/blog.strateg.eth/geBDRlFKYSiIDYNUyh5be-6FR1-b1YftIW_pRabKG88?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Murphy Labs has unveiled Strateg, a social yield infrastructure aimed
at streamlining DeFi experiences across various chains. Strateg
simplifies complex yield strategy creation and sharing while enabling
users to earn from multiple chains. It empowers users to profit from
any protocol on any chain. By connecting strategists with investors,
it allows less experienced DeFi users to invest their funds and manage
their risk while skilled strategists monetize their strategies.
Strateg automates many of the tasks involved in this process and
provides control over funds, promising decentralization and
streamlined user experiences in the DeFi landscape.

WHY SNX HAS SURPASSED GMX IN VOLUME (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1661002538324471809.html] 

Synthetix has surpassed GMX in trading volume, driven by several key
factors. It lowered trading fees to as low as 0.02% for certain pairs,
significantly increasing trade volume. Additionally, an airdrop
program incentivizes traders with $OP tokens that essentially outpace
the trading fees they incur on the protocol. Increased
decentralization, with trades settled by incentivized keepers and the
use of Pyth Network as a primary oracle, has given it greater trust
and uptime. Further, decentralizing frontends has increased
Synthetix's censorship resistance. 

SAFER IS A TOOL TO HELP YOU SIGN TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT SAFE‚ÄôS
FRONTEND (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/morpho-labs/safer?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

Safer is a tool designed to help sign and submit transactions to a
Safe without the need for interaction with Safe's backend or frontend.
It is especially useful when the Safe App is down and only the chain
can be trusted or used. Safer allows users to execute complex
transactions without intermediaries, enhancing DAO resilience. The
tool also supports various hardware wallets for signing and is an
effective fallback for ensuring continuity when there are problems
with Safe or any other application using these features.

AUTOMATED MARKET MAKING AND ARBITRAGE PROFITS IN THE PRESENCE OF FEES
(30 MINUTE READ)
[https://moallemi.com/ciamac/papers/lvr-fee-model-2023.pdf?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This study develops a model for understanding arbitrage profits in the
context of AMMs, factoring in trading fees and discrete arbitrageur
arrival times. It explains that these fees significantly affect
arbitrage profits and thus the profits and losses of liquidity
providers. The model considers the "loss-versus-rebalancing" (LVR)
concept, which reflects arbitrage profits due to price discrepancies,
and adjusts this concept to account for trading fees. The findings
suggest that running a blockchain with lower mean interblock time can
effectively reduce arbitrage profit without negatively impacting
liquidity provider fee income derived from noise trading. 

A CLOSER LOOK AT THE CURVE ECOSYSTEM (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1661425431403274240.html] 

The Curve ecosystem has unique tokenomics and a token emission model
with incentives that have fostered a healthy ecosystem and attracted a
range of key players including Convex, Yearn, Frax, Conic, Stake DAO,
Pirex, Votium Protocol, Llama Airforce, and more. Each of these
entities has unique interactions with CRV tokens, from aggregating
them, leveraging them to generate yield, or using them as part of
yield and governance strategies.
