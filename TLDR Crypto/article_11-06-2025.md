 SOCIETE GÉNERALE BECOMES FIRST MAJOR BANK TO LAUNCH STABLECOIN (6
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Societe Générale is the first major bank to launch a dollar-backed
stablecoin on Ethereum and Solana, with public trading set to begin in
July. These tokens are classified as e-money under the EU's MiCA
framework, offering regulated dollar liquidity to corporates,
financial institutions, and crypto exchanges. Reserves will be
custodied by BNY Mellon, initially held in cash and later invested in
yield-bearing assets, enabling use cases from trading and cross-border
payments to collateral management. The coin will be called “USD
CoinVertible.” 

 HOUSE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE VOTES FOR CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE BILL (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The House Agriculture Committee has advanced the Digital Asset Market
Clarity Act, setting the stage for a full House vote if also passed by
the House Financial Services Committee. The bill outlines regulatory
roles for the SEC and CFTC, mandates disclosures and fund segregation
by crypto firms, and exempts non-custodial platforms from money
transmitter laws.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PAY-TO-LEARN: MULTI-AGENT FINE TUNING WITH MICROTRANSACTIONS (12
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This onchain framework allows “student” language models to
automatically pay specialist evaluator agents in sub-cent USDC
micropayments on Base for structured feedback, eliminating the $2–5
per-annotator bottleneck of RLHF. By choosing evaluators from openly
published agent cards, models create a live marketplace that rewards
high-quality, domain-specific judgment and maintains feedback
relevance as capabilities improve, addressing reward-model drift and
echo-chamber issues noted in prior multi-judge research. Early results
show orders-of-magnitude cost savings and iterative performance gains,
with economic selection preserving evaluator diversity and driving
continual improvement. The system is already integrated into Nous
Research's Atropos RL framework. 

 AAVE GOES LIVE ON SONEIUM (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Aave V3 is now live on Soneium, a consumer-focused Ethereum L2 built
with the OP Stack and with over $150M in TVL. The deployment was led
by BGD Labs with risk support from Chaos Labs and LlamaRisk. Chainlink
will provide price oracle infrastructure to ensure secure market
operations.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BLUEPRINT TO BUILDING WEALTH IN WEB3 (30 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To go from $0 to $1 million in crypto, one should begin with
zero-cost opportunities like social-fi content creation and testnets,
then reinvest small earnings into on-chain activity and airdrops, and
gradually scale into DeFi, NFTs, stablecoin farming, and more advanced
strategies as capital grows. At each stage, have a mindset of
consistency, adaptability, action, and profit-taking, while avoiding
common pitfalls like leverage, memecoins, and security exploits. At
100k, consolidate gains through diversified stablecoin and DeFi
yields, Bitcoin/Ethereum DCA, and traditional assets, before finally
preserving wealth via broad diversification and real-world
investments. 

 STATE OF DEFAI Q2/2025 (35 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 After an initial Q1 surge around AI abstraction layers that suffered
decision paralysis and valuations sell-offs, DeFAI projects in Q2 have
pivoted to specialized discovery layers for trading and yield-farming
alpha. AI is now being embedded directly into existing DeFi workflows
via HUD overlays, while fully autonomous, noncustodial agents like
Giza's zkML-driven vault optimizers manage over $70 million in volume.
Simultaneously, major DeFi protocols (BasisOS, Zerion, Vectis, and
Mode) are rolling out AI roadmaps, from ML autopilots to
price-predictive vaults, to boost yield and UX. Looking ahead, the
convergence of traditional analytics with AI interfaces and robust,
verifiable DeFAI foundations is poised to drive the next wave of value
accrual as fundamentals regain favor.

 ETHEREUM IS HITTING A CRITICAL INFLECTION POINT (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum is moving beyond speculative hype toward real financial
innovation, driven by rising institutional adoption of stablecoins,
tokenization, and blockchain-based capital markets. With ETH ETFs
seeing $815M in inflows over 20 days and fintechs like Visa, Stripe,
and Robinhood building onchain, Ethereum is becoming the operating
layer for a new financial system. If stablecoin activity is valuable,
then so is Ethereum, marking a critical shift in how investors
perceive network assets like ETH. 

 THE GREAT COMEBACK OF DAOS.FUN (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 DAOs.fun's journey began as Tailwind Labs, a Cosmos-based wallet that
pivoted through a Sei wallet and a memecoin launchpad before finding
product-market fit in investment DAOs. In its final turnaround, the
team launched ai16z on Solana using the ElizaOS framework for
autonomous AI agents, earning 7,000 GitHub stars in one month and
reaching an $800 M market cap. The success spurred a wave of new DAO
launches, democratizing on-chain fund management.
