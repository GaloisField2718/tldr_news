MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FED CHAIR POWELL SAYS BITCOIN IS LIKE DIGITAL GOLD (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell compared Bitcoin to digital gold
during The New York Times' DealBook Summit, noting its volatility and
lack of use as a payment method, positioning it as a speculative asset
rather than a competitor to USD. He acknowledged Bitcoin's “staying
power” and highlighted its role as an alternative to gold while
emphasizing the Fed's cautious approach to crypto's interaction with
the banking system.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PANCAKESWAP LAUNCHES SPRINGBOARD (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 PancakeSwap's SpringBoard is a no-code platform for creating and
launching tokens on the BNB Chain. It offers features like automatic
liquidity pool integration, multi-token pairings, and fair launch
mechanisms. The platform focuses on ease of use and community
engagement while also providing optional Farm Program boosts and
liquidity support through CAKE. 

 VANA: POWERING THE FUTURE OF USER-OWNED AI (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Vana, an open protocol for AI data sovereignty, allows users to pool
and monetize their personal data through DataDAOs (data collectives)
while maintaining cryptographic control through encrypted personal
storage. It uses a two-layer architecture where data ownership records
and permissions exist on-chain while actual data remains privately
encrypted, with DataDAOs issuing tokens based on contribution quality.
The platform aims to challenge Big Tech's data monopolies by creating
a market where AI companies can purchase training data directly from
user collectives. The VANA token facilitates transactions and
governance while ensuring value flows back to data contributors
through a burn mechanism.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AGENTS VS MEMECOINS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While agents can actively generate content and build direct user
relationships, memecoins rely solely on external attention for value.
This fundamental difference in distribution - where agents create
self-sustaining user relationships through social media followings
versus memecoins' dependence on continuous external promotion -
suggests greater durability for agent tokens. This more stable
distribution model, combined with growth potential, makes AI tokens
more attractive to institutional investors than traditional memecoins.

 DOUBLEZERO: A FRAMEWORK FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE PERMISSIONLESS NETWORKS
(30 MINUTE READ) [11]

called N1 (Network 1) designed to create a high-performance
decentralized physical network layer optimized for distributed
systems. The protocol enables permissionless contribution of fiber
links while providing built-in verification services, aiming to
eliminate communication bottlenecks for existing L1 and L2 blockchains
through increased bandwidth and reduced latency. Created by former
Solana team members, the project represents an attempt to build a new
