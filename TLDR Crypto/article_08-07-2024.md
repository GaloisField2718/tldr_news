 2024 ELECTION: THE ROLE OF CRYPTO (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A Harris Poll survey conducted for Grayscale reveals a growing

include crypto in their investment portfolios.

 LAYERZERO BREAKDOWN (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 LayerZero helps facilitate secure and efficient communication between
different blockchains by using Ultra-Light Nodes, Oracles, and
Relayers. This setup allows blockchains, which are otherwise "isolated
like separate islands", to share information and resources smoothly,
solving the problem of interoperability in the blockchain ecosystem. 

 THE HOT START PROBLEM: WHEN SPECULATION IS A FEATURE VS A BUG (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The hot start problem is when the introduction of a token limits the
window of time a startup has to find PMF and facilitate organic growth
before users and liquidity decline. It is better than the cold start
problem for highly competitive markets, like LRTs, and networks with
passive supply-side participation, like L1s with staking or DePIN.
Though tokens are valuable tools for bootstrapping networks, they
require serious consideration into how to properly reward organic
users and drive proper incentives across the protocol.

promise higher staking rewards. Key updates include EigenLayer's
testnet rewards trial and notable events like Renzo's fundraise and
product launches, EtherFi's buyback, and Pendle's maturing markets.
