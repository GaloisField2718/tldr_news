[4] 

 James Wynn, a high-leverage trader on Hyperliquid known for
billion-dollar bets, was fully liquidated after his $1.25‚ÄØbillion
BTC long incurred a $37‚ÄØmillion loss when prices slid below
$105,000. He briefly switched to memecoins like PEPE and cycled
through assets including ETH, SUI, TRUMP, and FARTCOIN, at one point
holding an $85‚ÄØmillion unrealized gain. Despite ending the month
with just $23 in his account, Wynn's X account maintained confidence,
vowing to ‚Äúrun it back‚Äù and embrace high-risk plays.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 OPENSEA LEVELS UP: OS2 RELEASE, REWARDS, AND MORE (20 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 OpenSea has officially launched OS2 as its default platform, removing
the beta tag and expanding support to virtually every token across 19
chains with more networks coming soon. The company introduced a new
rewards program featuring "Voyages" that provide XP for using platform
features, serving as the foundation for its upcoming $SEA token
distribution where both past trading history and current activity will
be rewarded through separate allocations. The platform has implemented
strict anti-botting measures to ensure rewards go to genuine users
while emphasizing that several major innovations must be in place
before the token generation event, though no specific timeline was
provided. 

 PORTO: SIGN IN WITH SUPERPOWERS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Porto is an open-source TypeScript library that enables passwordless,
execution-powered accounts on EVM by integrating WebAuthn passkeys or
OAuth without requiring seed phrases, private keys, or extensions. It
delivers developer-first compatibility with Wagmi and Viem, boasts a
>50% gas-efficiency improvement over alternatives through a redesigned
account abstraction stack, and ensures predictable stablecoin fees and
reliable next-block inclusion. The preview adds friction-free
onboarding via Apple Pay onramp, targeted promotions, and modular
integration, alongside advanced features like account delegation,
subscriptions, and EIP-7702 upgrades for existing wallets. Porto's
roadmap focuses on institutional-grade security, audit-driven bug
bounties, and cross-chain interoperability to make every account a
Porto account.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 PANTERA MAY 2025 BLOCKCHAIN LETTER (35 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Digital Asset Treasury companies (DATs) are emerging as public-market
vehicles that mirror MicroStrategy's model, enabling investors to gain
Bitcoin or other crypto exposure through listed equity by harvesting
volatility and issuing convertible instruments. Unlike ETFs, DATs lock
up crypto indefinitely, potentially compounding crypto-per-share
growth and reducing sell pressure on underlying assets. Separately,
stablecoins have become crypto's ‚Äúkiller app‚Äù by placing dollars
onchain and driving demand for U.S. Treasuries via tokens, while the
forthcoming GENIUS Act aims to formalize their regulatory framework. 

 STABLECOINS ARE A NEW PLATFORM (40 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stablecoins are evolving beyond a simple payments rail into a
foundational infrastructure layer, akin to how the internet disrupted
telecom, for global, 24/7, programmable finance across B2B, B2C, and
infrastructure stacks. The GENIUS Act's regulatory clarity will treat
permitted stablecoin issuers' tokens as cash equivalents, sparking a
funding surge and driving widespread adoption in cross‚Äëborder
payments, domestic treasury applications, and embedded finance. By
abstracting existing rails like SWIFT, ACH, and PIX into a unified,
developer‚Äëfriendly platform, stablecoins unlock new use cases like
instant B2B transfers, treasury yield optimization,
stablecoin‚Äënative checking accounts, and programmable prepaid cards.
Companies that learn from past BaaS successes and failures and develop
robust stablecoin approaches will be best positioned to thrive as
finance moves on‚Äëchain.

The exchange reported that the threat actors used identifiable
infrastructure, reused email credentials, and made several errors
