 CRYPTO GAMING PLATFORM PLAYDAPP LOSES $290 MILLION WORTH OF TOKENS IN
TWO EXPLOITS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 PlayDapp, a crypto gaming and NFT platform, has been exploited twice
within the past few days. A hacker minted 1.79 billion PLA tokens
worth over $290 million and then laundered the funds via crypto
exchanges. The gaming platform failed in its attempt to negotiate the
return of the stolen funds for a $1 million reward. PlayDapp is
currently working with law enforcement, crypto exchanges, and
blockchain forensic firms to mitigate the situation.

optimistic bridge that relies on a 1-of-N trust model, incorporating

security. 

 LEADERLESS AUCTIONS (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new concept called Leaderless Auctions could be the solution for
"last look" problems that arise in decentralized auctions. Leaderless
Auctions require participants to commit all their bids simultaneously,
making for a more even playing field. Auction results can be finalized
on-chain and efficiently verified via signature aggregation. The
protocol has limitations such as latency variations and undisguised
public bids.

READ) [11] 

 Sotheby's auction house will auction EtherRock NFTs, a move that has
caused a bit of a stir in both the traditional art space and the

space should represent. However, they are not all that different from
other forms of modern art.
