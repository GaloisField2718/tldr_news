[6] 

 Cardano is preparing for the Chang hard fork in June to enter the
Voltaire era after a multiyear effort towards decentralization. It

 OPTIMAL PULLOUT GAME FOR PROOF-OF-STAKE BLOCKCHAINS: A MECHANISM
DESIGN APPROACH (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Designing proof of stake exit queues requires proper optimization of
security and flexibility with the intent of satisfying time
constraints while minimizing disutility from waiting. When stakers
have the same time sensitivity, a dynamic capacity first come first
serve queue is ideal. When stakers have different time sensitivities,
protocols should use a dynamic capacity protocol queue.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE MARKET'S HOPIUM ADDICTION (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In a recent meeting, the Fed acted responsibly by expressing
uncertainty about inflation but may have missed the window to
stimulate the economy. This author's biggest fear is that
month-over-month inflation will start picking back up, raising
concerns about the demand for long-dated US bonds. Current conditions
do not bode well for parts of the market relying on abundant
liquidity, and a liquidity air pocket will persist until there is
better inflation data or the Fed capitulates on its inflation target
to support the labor market. 

 47 USE CASES OF BLOCKCHAIN, PRIVACY, AND VERIFIABILITY (32 MINUTE
READ) [9]

examples of how blockchain and ZK can solve real-world problems. The
list includes programmable identity, combining datasets for research
without disclosure, and private smart homes. More fun, out-of-the-box
examples include planetary defense, which would coordinate
cross-government systems without revealing sensitive information, and
AI targeting that proves an object was targeted correctly without
revealing how.

 MONEY AFTER AI IS CRYPTO (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 As intelligence becomes electricity, money becomes crypto, as it is a
provably scarce resource that can bridge between distinct economic
actors. Private keys will be the best way to control AI robots and
will be based on web3 backends for security. AI is digital abundance,
but crypto is digital scarcity and a direct complement.
