MARKETS & BUSINESS

 ETHEREUM TREASURIES TOP $17B ACROSS 69 ENTITIES (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Collective ETH holdings by 69 entities have passed 4.1M ETH ($17.6B),
equal to 3.39% of supply, as corporate treasuries accelerate
accumulation. BitMine Immersion leads with 1.5M ETH, followed by
SharpLink Gaming's 740,800 ETH and the Ethereum Foundation's 231,600
ETH. Public companies alone now hold 2.6M ETH ($10.9B), while U.S.
spot ETFs control 6.7M ETH, or 5.5% of circulating supply. 

 CORPORATE BITCOIN TREASURIES COULD RAISE CREDIT RISKS (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Bitcoin treasury strategies could elevate credit risk profiles due to
regulatory uncertainty, volatility, liquidity challenges, counterparty
exposure, and custody issues. There is extreme concentration in the
space, with MicroStrategy controlling over 629,000 BTC or 64% of all
public company treasury holdings out of approximately 3.68 million BTC
($428 billion) held across various corporate and institutional
entities. Heavy reliance on Bitcoin reserves could strain liquidity
management, while price volatility adds additional risk. Different
tokens carry distinct technological and governance challenges.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 METAMASK TO LAUNCH MUSD STABLECOIN (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 MetaMask's mUSD is a fully-backed stablecoin issued by Stripe-owned
Bridge and powered by M0. It will be launched later this year on
Ethereum and Linea. Billed as the first stablecoin native to a
self-custodial wallet, mUSD will integrate across MetaMask's ecosystem
for on-ramps, swaps, bridging, and spending, including with the
MetaMask Card. Backed by cash and Treasuries that generate yield, mUSD
aims to deepen liquidity on Linea and Ethereum while reducing
onboarding friction for MetaMask's 100M+ users. 

 WYOMING LAUNCHES VISA-SUPPORTED STABLECOIN (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Wyoming launched the Frontier Stable Token (FRNT) on mainnet across
seven blockchains, making it the first US state-issued stablecoins
with a statutorily mandated 102% reserve requirement backed by
Treasury bills and USD. The stablecoin integrates with Visa's payment
network, enabling use anywhere Visa is accepted, including Apple Pay,
Google Pay, and physical cards, though public access remains limited
due to ongoing regulatory hurdles. The move represents a significant
precedent for state-level crypto innovation, with officials
highlighting potential government efficiency improvements through
programmable payments for tax refunds, vendor payments, and social
benefits. It builds on Wyoming's position as a crypto-friendly
jurisdiction with over 45 pieces of digital asset legislation since
2016, potentially setting a template for other states to issue their
own stablecoins.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 FOUR-YEAR CYCLE TOP VS EXTENDED CYCLE TO 2026 (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A debate is emerging over whether Bitcoin will follow its historical
four-year cycle pattern with a 2025 top or extend into 2026 due to
fundamental market structure changes. The traditional cycle case
relies on pattern recognition and potential self-fulfilling prophecy
effects, while the extended cycle thesis points to institutional
participation creating smoother profit-taking behavior, regulatory
clarity removing systematic risks, and Fed Chair transition dynamics,
with Powell's term ending May 2026. Key differentiating factors
include the absence of retail euphoria, continued stablecoin supply
growth, and new demand sources like ETFs and pension funds, which
didn't exist in previous cycles. The analysis suggests focusing on
systematic exit strategies rather than attempting to time cycle tops
perfectly, while monitoring stablecoin market cap growth and DAT
leverage risks as leading indicators. 

 THE TRILLION $ NARRATIVE (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Memecoin activity has hit new lows, with only 124K daily active
addresses on August 17, signaling a shift toward tokenized startups as
the next major crypto narrative despite Ben Pasternak's failed
execution with Launchcoin. The concept addresses a structural mismatch
between the $13 trillion private equity market and crypto's need for
substantial assets, creating perfect conditions for retail to access
early-stage innovation with immediate liquidity. Tokenized startups
offer advantages across all stakeholders: founders get capital and
distribution, investors get liquid exposure to real businesses, and
GenZ entrepreneurs can weaponize their attention-maximizing skills
into tradable assets from day one. There will be a three-phase
evolution from non-security tokenized startups to mid-cap pre-IPO
tokenization to large private company tokenization, representing
crypto's entry into the massive untapped private equity market.

 PROTOCOL TOKEN BUYBACKS HIT $40M WEEKLY (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Protocols are increasingly mimicking corporate share repurchase
strategies, with nearly $40M in weekly token buybacks last week, led
by Hyperliquid ($24M) and Pump.fun ($10M). Buybacks aim to reduce
supply and signal long-term confidence, but their effectiveness is
mixed—prices may benefit temporarily but often face pressure once
programs slow. Sustainability depends on strong, recurring fee
revenue, making high-revenue protocols better positioned to maintain
consistent buybacks than those reliant on depleting treasuries. 

 ETHENA: STABLECOIN PURE PLAY WITH NEW GROWTH FLYWHEELS (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Ethena's yield-bearing stablecoin USDe has exploded to $11.3B supply,
making it the fastest USD asset ever to $10B and the #3 stablecoin by
market cap. Its new StablecoinX DAT raised $260M in cash (plus $60M
ENA), with proceeds funneled into ENA buybacks, creating a reflexive
loop that could scale further if the vehicle trades above mNAV.
Upcoming catalysts include HyENAtrade, a perp DEX on Hyperliquid that
could generate $117M–$234M in annual fees, and a fee switch for sENA
stakers, potentially delivering 5–25% yield.
