 LUMMIS SEEKS WAIVED TAXES ON CRYPTO ACTIVITY IN BUDGET BILL (7 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Senator Lummis has filed an amendment to the Senate's “Big
Beautiful Bill” that would exempt small crypto transactions under
$300 (capped at $5,000 annually) from capital gains taxes and
eliminate double taxation on staking and mining rewards by taxing them
only upon sale. The proposal also seeks to clarify tax treatment for
crypto lending, wash sales, and charitable contributions in a bid to
reduce friction for casual users and align policy with industry
practices. While the amendment has not yet been voted on, it is part
of the Senate's ongoing “vote-a-rama” process amid negotiations
over the nearly 1,000-page spending package. 

 FIVE ARRESTED IN $541M CRYPTO FRAUD CASE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Spain's Guardia Civil, with support from US, French, and Estonian
authorities, arrested five individuals in connection with a
cryptocurrency investment fraud scheme that duped over 5,000 victims
out of approximately €460 million. The suspects were detained in
operations on the Canary Islands and in Madrid, where investigators
also executed search warrants. Authorities say the criminal network
laundered funds through a Hong Kong–based corporate and banking
structure, using global associates, multiple payment gateways, and
crypto exchange accounts to receive, store, and transfer illicit
proceeds.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ROBINHOOD ANNOUNCES L2, TOKENIZED STOCKS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Robinhood is launching tokenized equities for 200+ stocks starting in
the EU, offering 24/5 trading and dividend payouts directly in-app,
initially on Arbitrum and later its own L2. The company also announced
ETH and SOL staking for U.S. users, new crypto-reward auto-purchases
tied to its Gold Card, and perpetuals trading for EU users routed via
Bitstamp. The push marks a major step toward integrating traditional
finance with onchain rails. 

 XSTOCKS NOW LIVE: TOKENIZED STOCKS FOR THE DEFI ERA (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Backed's xStocks are now live on Bybit, Kraken, and Solana DeFi,
offering over 60 tokenized stocks for 24/7, onchain trading and global
accessibility. Bybit and Kraken have joined the xStocks Alliance,
while Chainlink's Data Streams provide sub-second, onchain price
feeds, and corporate action verification. These tokenized equities
plug into Solana's DeFi stack, including Kamino money markets for
lending, Raydium AMMs for liquidity provision, Jupiter for
aggregation, and Phantom for direct trading, to enable lending,
borrowing, fee-earning, and complex structured products. xStocks'
neutral, multi-chain design aims to bridge traditional capital markets
and DeFi.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE HODLER'S FALLACY (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto functions as an extractive arbitrage system rather than a
traditional investment market, where HODLing rarely pays off – only
3.7% of tokens recover a 75% drawdown, and 86% of large-FDV launches
plunge at least 75%. Altcoins largely underperform Bitcoin, and
revenue-generating protocols like Hyperliquid, Maple, and Aave are
exceptional outliers, not the rule. Venture capital struggles because
tokens lack equity-like cash flows and favor early-stage edge that
disappears as funds scale. True winners in crypto are market-neutral
actors that systematically extract value regardless of price
direction. 

 HOW TO PROFIT ON PREDICTION MARKETS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There are four proven strategies for trading real-money prediction
markets: arbitrage across platforms, reacting quickly to breaking
news, live-event trading, and building predictive models. Prediction
markets are uniquely attractive because of their low institutional
presence, minimal fees, and inefficiencies that offer retail traders a
quantifiable edge.

 CIRCLE APPLIES TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL TRUST BANK (2 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Circle has applied to the OCC to establish a federally regulated
trust bank (First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A.) to oversee
USDC reserves and offer custody services to institutions. The move
aims to align Circle with requirements under the proposed GENIUS Act
and further integrate USDC into the U.S. financial system. CEO Jeremy
Allaire framed it as a step toward building market-neutral
infrastructure for the global internet financial system. 

 ROBINHOOD'S TOKENIZED STOCKS EVENT SHAKES TRADFI AND DEFI (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Robinhood's “To Catch a Token” event exceeded attendee
expectations, with its seamless integration of tokenized stocks, the
Robinhood App, Bithumb exchange, and the Robinhood Chain emerging as a
key breakthrough. The decision to build on Arbitrum and Ethereum
instead of Solana reinforces Ethereum's DeFi dominance while boosting
Arbitrum's cultural and financial stake, especially with Arbitrum
earning 10% of Robinhood Chain sequencer fees. The event also sparked
conversation on access to private markets, permissionless trading, and
the relevance of collectives like Optimism, as Robinhood's model shows
how financial institutions can own their full tech stack.
