 LUMMIS, GILLIBRAND INTRODUCE BILL PROHIBITING UNBACKED ALGORITHMIC
STABLECOINS AMONG OTHER REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and pro-crypto Cynthia Lummis
(R-WY) released the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act to
regulate the stablecoin industry. The act would require stablecoin
issuers to hold one-to-one cash or cash-equivalent assets and prohibit
unbacked algorithmic stablecoins. If an issuer experiences insolvency,
there would be an FDIC conservatorship and resolution. There are some
concerns that the bill is too strict with its definition of cash
equivalents and that it could prohibit innovation with new stablecoin
designs.

 WHAT ARE RUNES? A GUIDE TO THE NEW FUNGIBLE TOKEN PROTOCOL ON BITCOIN
(5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Runes protocol, set to launch in April 2024, is a new fungible
token standard on Bitcoin that aims to improve upon the shortcomings
of its predecessor, BRC-20. By integrating with Bitcoin's existing
UTXO model and utilizing OP_RETURN for data storage, Runes minimizes
on-chain footprint and network congestion while offering a more
user-friendly and accessible token creation process. 

 2024: THE YEAR OF CRYPTO'S MODULAR EXPANSION (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Modularity breaks up blockchain functionality into three parts ‚Äî
data availability and consensus, settlement, and execution ‚Äî each of
which gets its own chain or environment. Prominent projects exist in
each sector, along with interoperability to unite liquidity, with the
goal of integrating together to make something greater than the sum of
their parts. The commoditization of block space and execution will
enable applications to operate at much larger scales with grander
visions.

 PRIVACY BY DEFAULT ON L1S? (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Legendary cryptographer Wei Dai weighs in on the pros and cons of
whether a base layer like Ethereum should offer privacy by default. On
one hand, it is technically feasible for privacy to be implemented,
and having it as the default option makes it much more normalized,
especially for users from traditional finance. On the other hand, this
would be incredibly complex to implement, remove some level of
neutrality, and not align with the rollup-centric roadmap's idea of
end users never interacting with the base chain. Dai leans towards a
transparent base layer with L2s and apps leading the experimentation
with privacy based on their goals.
