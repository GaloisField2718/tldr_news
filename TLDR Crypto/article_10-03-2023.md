NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL ALLEGES ETHER IS A SECURITY IN KUCOIN
LAWSUIT (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/09/new-york-attorney-general-sues-crypto-exchange-kucoin-alleges-ether-is-a-security/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


New York State Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against
KuCoin on Thursday alleging that the exchange is violating securities
laws by offering tokens - including ether - that meet the definition
of a security without registering with the NYAGâ€™s office. James
argued that ether, luna (LUNA) token and terraUSD (UST) stablecoin are
securities under the Martin Act and KuCoin was required to register
before selling them. The NYAGâ€™s office is seeking a court order to
stop KuCoin from operating in New York and implementing geo-blocking. 

BIDEN BUDGET TAKES AIM AT CRYPTO WASH TRADING (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://blockworks.co/news/biden-budget-takes-aim-at-crypto-wash-trading?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


President Biden's 2024 Fiscal Year Budget proposes tax changes on
cryptocurrency transactions, such as eliminating wash trading to
prevent tax-deductible losses on failed investments and applying the
same tax rules as traditional securities. The bill estimates this
could raise $24 billion for the Treasury and also plans to impose an
increase in tax rate for the wealthiest 0.01% to a minimum of 25%. The
changes would apply to sales for fiat currency, exchanges for goods
and services, airdrops, minting, and staking activities. The Budget is
expected to be released today but needs approval from Congress before
it can be signed off by the President.

READ)
[https://thedefiant.io/instadapp-avocado-multi-network-wallet?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Instadapp has launched its Avocado wallet, which can be used to
execute multi-network transactions while being connected to a single
network. Transactions are processed through Avocado's RPC and gas fees
are paid in USDC. Avocado also charges a 20% fee on top of the gas
fees, with half of the revenue going to dApps that integrate with the
platform and the remainder going to the Instadapp DAO. Coinbase,
Uniswap, and ETHDenver have all recently released or discussed wallet
offerings, indicating the importance of user experience when it comes
to cryptocurrency adoption.

[https://dune.com/blog/introducing-dune-sql?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

Dune has launched DuneSQL, an attempt to make the fastest, most
powerful and convenient crypto data querying experience on the planet.
It features many Dune-specific improvements such as using other
queries as views and querying byte arrays directly. Postgres-based v1
platform is almost fully sunset and Spark SQL will be sunset in July
2023. Wizards can use an automated tool to help make query changes and
get help from the team if they are having difficulties. There is also
a tool that will help Wizards migrate their existing queries to
DuneSQL.

TOKENOMICS OF PROJECTS THAT 100XED IN THE 2021 BULL AND WHAT THAT
MIGHT MEAN FOR THE NEXT BULL (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1633456943728668674.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This thread shows an analysis of the tokenomics of "100xers" in the
2018-2021 bull markets, which highlights the fact that there were 57
100xers in the top 300 per CMC. The analysis shows there are few high
circulating supply 100xers, and that mid circulating supply projects
were the most represented category, as they blend ecosystem dynamism
with not as dilutive tokenomics. It also outlines strategies for
mid-long term and short term horizons, but stresses the importance of
also considering survival bias with the coins in the study.

DUST ON CRUST - A NEW STABLECOIN PROPOSAL BY ARTHUR HAYES (25 MINUTE
READ) [https://blog.bitmex.com/dust-on-crust/?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

In this article, Arthur Hayes discusses a new design for a stablecoin
called Satoshi Nakamoto Dollar (NUSD). The goal of the NUSD is to
create a token that is worth 1 USD but does not require the services
of the fiat banking system. It works by depositing 1 BTC on a
derivatives exchange and shorting one XBTUSD swap. The Bitcoin value
of the swap increases exponentially as the USD price of Bitcoin falls,
and approaches zero as the USD price of Bitcoin rises. In theory, each
side of the pair should equally offset the other. There are some risks
that come into play, and there are still aspects of centralization,
but the article attempts to provide some solutions to those potential
problems. 

COMMUNITY-AS-A-SERVICE - THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP IN THE NASCENT PVP
WORLD OF CRYPTO (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://pageone.gg/p/community-as-a-service?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

The concept of Community-as-a-Service (CaaS) focuses on providing
access to a particular group of people that can be considered a
marketable product. Examples of CaaS include Mobalytics for League of
Legends, Aim Trainers for FPS games, and mods for modern video games.
In DeFi, Convex was created to serve the community using Curve.fi, and
Delegate.cash services NFT holders. CaaS differs from the current
competition-driven crypto landscape, as its goal is to serve the
community of an established project, like Tribally did for Axie
Infinity by building a new website. The article posits that more value
will be able to be created by catering to specific communities as
crypto continues to mature rather than attempting to disrupt the
status quo.

healthy deposits.
