MARKETS & BUSINESS

 NORTH KOREA TARGETS CRYPTO WORKERS WITH NEW INFO-STEALING MALWARE (5
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A threat actor associated with North Korea has been infiltrating
interviews in the crypto industry and infecting companies with
malware. Their aim is to steal passwords for crypto wallets, primarily
for companies based in India. The victims are having their computers
remotely operated after agreeing to do a video interview with the
exploiters and downloading suggested software. 

 DEFI LENDING HITS RECORD $55 BILLION TVL (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DeFi lending protocols have reached a record $55.7B in TVL, with Aave
v3 up 55% in two months and generating $1.6M in daily fees, while
Morpho Blue and Maple Finance post major gains. Maple's 417% TVL
growth is powered by undercollateralized RWA credit lines and
tokenized debt infrastructure, marking a broader shift in capital
markets behavior on-chain.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PROJECT 11: BUILDING BITCOIN'S QUANTUM-READY FUTURE (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Project 11 is safeguarding crypto against the coming threat of
quantum computing. The team's first product, yellowpages, offers a
post-quantum proof of Bitcoin ownership, allowing users to generate
quantum-resistant keys today without moving assets onchain. As quantum
progress accelerates, the company aims to upgrade existing protocols
like Bitcoin while also developing quantum-native systems such as
quantum key distribution, certified randomness, and quantum money. 

 INTRODUCING THE BRALE STABLECOIN API (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Brale has launched a production-ready Stablecoin API that enables
businesses to integrate stablecoin-powered payments in minutes. The
API offers 0 bps fees for on-ramps, off-ramps, and swaps across 50+
stablecoins on 15+ blockchains. It supports stablecoin issuance from
Brale, Circle, and Paxos. It also features ACH support, virtual
accounts, privacy-preserving transfers, and a single call interface
for converting USD to onchain assets. Designed for B2B use cases,
teams are using Brale for global payouts, merchant settlement, card
programs, and programmable USD accounts.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 SPARK: ACTIVE CAPITAL ALLOCATOR FOR DEFI (40 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Spark is positioning itself as DeFi's most advanced onchain capital
allocator by combining low-cost capital from Sky (formerly MakerDAO)
with an active asset deployment engine called the Spark Liquidity
Layer (SLL). Unlike traditional banks or passive DeFi protocols, Spark
manages over $7.5B in assets across lending, real-world assets, and
DeFi-native protocols. Spark issues sUSDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin
backed by USDS deposits, and uses the SLL to rebalance capital across
chains in real time. Its structural moat, driven by integration with
Sky's capital base and governance-defined rates, enables it to offer
sustainable yields, build feedback loops between savings and lending,
and merge TradFi stability with DeFi composability at scale. 

 HOW TO MANAGE RISK IN CRYPTO (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To manage risk in crypto effectively, define a clear invalidation
level for every trade (price, time, or event-based), then use a
formula to size your position based on how far your stop-loss is from
entry. As trades evolve, track risk/reward changes and adjust stops or
take profits only when the original thesis changes, not out of fear.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CRYPTO MOVED AWAY FROM RETAIL (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Crypto fundraising has shifted from open-access ICOs to more
exclusive strategies dominated by insiders, with retail increasingly
sidelined. While retail briefly regained ground during DeFi Summer by
providing protocol liquidity in exchange for high APYs, the rise of
professionalized early-stage liquidity provision has created a new
edge largely inaccessible to them. This model allows VCs and angel
investors to supply critical, high-risk liquidity to nascent protocols
in exchange for premium incentives â€“ a game retail can rarely play.
As valuations climb and dilution worsens, retail investors face
diminished returns and limited opportunities, marking a return to a
cycle of asymmetric access and outcomes. 

 EXPLANATION OF COINBASE COMMERCE PROTOCOL (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coinbase Commerce's new protocol uses smart contract escrow and
customizable operators to enable programmable payments and refunds in
USDC. This allows platforms like Shopify, Visa, or others to enforce
their own rules (e.g. chargebacks and dispute logic) directly
on-chain, mimicking traditional payment networks but with more
flexibility and transparency.

GENIUS Act advanced in Congress.
