 AAVE DAO VS. AAVE LABS - TOKEN HOLDERS LOOK TO RECLAIM CONTROL (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 An AAVE token holder has proposed a radical escalation in Aave
governance, using a “poison pill” lawsuit to transfer Aave Labs'
IP, trademarks, and even equity to the DAO, effectively turning the
for-profit developer into a DAO subsidiary. The move follows backlash
over a CoW Swap integration that redirected frontend swap fees from
the DAO to a private address, reigniting long-standing tensions over
who controls Aave's brand, revenue, and protocol direction. 

 “DEFI WILL WIN”: AAVE CEO SAYS SEC ENDS YEARS-LONG PROBE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The SEC has formally concluded its four-year investigation into the
Aave Protocol and does not plan to recommend enforcement action. The
closure places Aave among a growing list of crypto firms cleared as
the SEC shifts away from aggressive registration-focused enforcement.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 JAPAN'S SBI HOLDINGS TO LAUNCH YEN-PEGGED STABLECOIN (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 SBI Holdings partnered with Startale Group to launch a
yen-denominated stablecoin in Q2 2026 with issuance handled by Shinsei
Trust & Banking and circulation via licensed exchange SBI VC Trade,
positioning it for global settlement and institutional adoption. The
token will complement Startale's USDSC dollar stablecoin to power a
24/7 tokenized stock exchange and enable AI agent payments and
tokenized asset distributions beyond everyday transactions. The
project aligns with Japan's Financial Services Agency approving JPYC
as the country's first yen stablecoin while supporting a joint
initiative from Mizuho, MUFG, and SMBC. SBI separately partnered with
Ripple to introduce RLUSD to the Japanese market in 2026. 

 VISA OFFERS STABLECOIN SETTLEMENT FOR US BANKS USING CIRCLE'S USDC (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Visa is opening its US network to stablecoin settlement, allowing
banks to settle transactions using Circle's USDC on Solana. Cross
River Bank and Lead Bank are among the first adopters. The move
enables 24/7 settlement, including weekends and holidays, reframing
stablecoins as a back-end treasury and settlement upgrade rather than
a consumer payments product. With Visa's stablecoin volumes already
running at multi-billion-dollar annualized levels, instant settlement
is quickly becoming a competitive necessity for banks, not an
experiment.

 AUTODELEVERAGING: $653 MILLION LOST TO A GREEDY HEURISTIC? (25 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Hyperliquid and Binance's Queue ADL algorithm liquidated $653 million
more trader profit than necessary to cover bad debt in a liquidation
cascade on October 10. The greedy heuristic from 2015 targeted whale
market makers 40+ times over 12 minutes, while risk-agnostic Pro-Rata
spread losses equally without accounting for leverage differences. New
research proposes Risk-Aware Pro-Rata mechanisms to reweight haircuts
based on trader leverage to balance the ADL Trilemma, where no
strategy simultaneously optimizes solvency, fairness, and revenue.
Convex optimization shows that prior-independent strategies outperform
Queue by orders of magnitude. 

 THE GOLDEN AGE OF CRYPTO IS OVER (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto mirrors poker's 2003-2014 golden age decline as simple
strategies stop working. Crypto is currently at poker's 2012
inflection point, where opportunities exist but require discipline,
work ethic, and edge-finding through whitepapers, thesis development,
and trading logs versus easy 10x NFT mints and abundant airdrops.
Retail already cycled through multiple burn-and-leave episodes rather
than waiting to arrive, now entering via small-percentage Bitcoin ETF
DCA allocations that support adoption without fueling speculative
golden eras, while competition is intensifying, requiring constant
studying and latest tool utilization, like poker's mid-2010s solver
adoption. Unlike poker's zero-sum game with bleak long-term outlook,
limited by player count, crypto adds real technological value with
inevitable tenfold adoption growth, practical use cases, and
constructive regulation, making the long-term view bright despite the
easy-money golden age ending.

 MOST USED CHAIN BASED ON WHAT? (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Solana's TVL market share surged from 0.7% to 9.5% since 2023, while
Ethereum L2s like Optimism and Arbitrum stagnated or declined.
Solana's fee capture has exploded 123x from 0.17% to 22.39%, now
matching Ethereum's 40% monthly share. The network has dominated 82%
of blockchain transactions since January 2023 and doubled Ethereum's
DEX aggregation volume while user share climbed from 6% to 28% versus
Ethereum's 70% decline from 20% to 6%. While Ethereum remains the most
valuable decentralized social platform for monetary applications,
numerical literacy demands acknowledging that Solana leads on user
count, transaction count, volume, DEX aggregation, TVL growth, and
fees. 

 CRYPTO CARDS DON'T HAVE ANY FUTURE (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto cards add abstraction layers, strengthening Visa and
Mastercard gatekeepers rather than replacing them, as most function as
liquidity bridges, selling crypto for fiat on each transaction, with
infrastructure providers like Rain enabling companies to launch
branded cards without significant engineering. Non-custodial cards
lock users into specific ecosystems like MetaMask on Linea or Plasma
Card, creating Apple-style habit formation for natural liquidity
attraction rather than mining campaigns, though they lack privacy
since KYC links crypto addresses to real identities. EtherFi stands
out as the only viable long-term model by collateralizing crypto for
fiat loans, avoiding taxable selling events on each purchase while
generating yield, positioning it as the true DeFi-TradFi intersection
versus competitors capitalizing on narratives without vertical
innovation.
