GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AERODROME: THE ONCHAIN LIQUIDITY ENGINE (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Aerodrome has emerged as the dominant DEX on Base, capturing 63%
market share and growing its TVL to $1.3B and monthly volumes to
$16.5B. Its success stems from its design, which combines features
from Curve tokenomics and Uniswap V3-style concentrated liquidity. The
platform has become particularly popular for cbBTC, commanding 80% of
volume, while its emissions strategy has been productive in building
sustainable liquidity. 

 ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF A COMPETITIVE BLOB MARKET (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 The blob market has entered a new competitive phase. It has generated
$11M in fees since its inception. 11.8% of fees were from priority
fees, while the rest of the ETH was burned. L2s have profited nearly
$20 million from the cost savings from blobs, with some achieving 99%
profit margins on transaction fees. Fees could see a similar increase
if the blob count doubles, though increased competition and proposed
changes like EIP 7762 could impact profitability and fee dynamics.

safeguarded and to restore trust in the ecosystem.
