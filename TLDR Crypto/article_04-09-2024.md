 ETHERVISTA DEEP DIVE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethervista, a new Ethereum-based DeFi project, is gaining attention
for its innovative fee and liquidity mechanism. It offers a fair
launch with a deflationary token model and potential future features
like lending and flash loans. While it's early, the project targets a
gap in Ethereum's DeFi space, appealing to users frustrated by the
lack of new developments. Caution is advised with liquidity unlocking
soon, which may cause price fluctuations. 

 5 LESSONS FOR BOOTSTRAPPING PROTOCOL COMMUNITIES (5 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Community is the foundation of ecosystem growth, as engaged members
can attract developers and infrastructure providers. Qualitative
community experiences are more important than quantitative metrics at
early stages, and short-term incentives are only beneficial if there
is a strong culture for retention. Promoting talent within the
community and delegating trust creates loyalty and engagement, and a
human-centered onboarding process helps with interest. 

 LIQUIDATIONS 101: UNDERSTANDING CAPITAL LOSS AND PENALTIES IN DEFI
LENDING MARKETS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article compares liquidation processes in traditional DeFi
lending markets with Fluid's approach. In markets like Aave,
liquidations can result in users losing 50-100% of their collateral.
In contrast, Fluid minimizes user losses by incrementally liquidating
only as needed to bring a position below the liquidation threshold and
applying a much smaller penalty.

lending service, with a governance token, WLFI. Several team members,

backgrounds, raising questions about the project's legitimacy and
long-term prospects. 

 WEB3: THE HOUSEHOLD NAME IN THE MAKING (40 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Binance Research finds that Web3 lags significantly behind Web2 in
user adoption and retention. The two main challenges are excessive
speculation and an overemphasis on infrastructure at the expense of
consumer-facing products. Mainstream adoption requires dapps with real
utility, expanded distribution channels utilizing Web2 ecosystems, and
improved mobile accessibility.
