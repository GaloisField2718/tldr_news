 MAKING ETHEREUM ALIGNMENT LEGIBLE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article from Vitalik Buterin addresses how to properly balance
decentralization and cooperation within the Ethereum ecosystem by
proposing a more measurable concept of ‚ÄúEthereum alignment.‚Äù
Specific criteria include open source practices, adherence to open
standards, decentralization and security, and positive-sum
contributions to Ethereum and the broader world. There should be clear
tracking mechanisms to create a more meritocratic and inclusive
ecosystem to have projects compete on alignment rather than social
connections or attention.

 INTEROPERABILITY'S LACK OF PROGRESS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Even after billions of dollars of investment, interoperability is
still complex and primarily valuable for sending tokens. Choosing a
chain without good connectivity or a thriving ecosystem can mean an
early death, no matter how promising an app is. Liquidity
fragmentation, better latency, and more accessible connections are
essential for true interoperability. Polymer Hub is one of the
solutions aiming to solve these problems. 

 IS THE ERA OF PURPOSE-BUILT BLOCKCHAINS COMING? (18 MINUTE READ) [11]


 This article traces the evolution of blockchain architectures from
monolithic designs to purpose-built solutions, drawing parallels with
the concept of division of labor in economic history. It highlights
the limitations of general-purpose blockchains and the emergence of
performance-oriented and app-specific chains, which led to the
introduction of purpose-built chains as a new paradigm. Chains like
Story and Injective aim to optimize infrastructure for specific use
cases while maintaining interoperability.
