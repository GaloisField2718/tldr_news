 US SENATE TO HOLD HEARING ON CRYPTO TAXATION (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Senate Finance Committee has scheduled a hearing on October 1 to
review how cryptocurrency should be taxed, reflecting the growing
urgency around modernizing the US tax code for digital assets. The
session comes as lawmakers debate exemptions for small, routine crypto
purchases and broader reforms. Current IRS rules treat all crypto
transactions as taxable events, even when no gains or losses occur. 

 EUROPEAN BANKS JOIN FORCES TO ISSUE MICA-COMPLIANT EURO STABLECOIN (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nine major European banks, including ING, UniCredit, Danske Bank, and
CaixaBank, have formed a consortium to launch a MiCA-compliant
euro-denominated stablecoin expected to be issued in the second half
of 2026. The initiative aims to provide a European alternative to the
US-dominated stablecoin market and enhance Europe's strategic autonomy
in digital payments, with the new company being established in the
Netherlands and seeking e-money institution licensing from the Dutch
Central Bank. The stablecoin will offer near-instant, low-cost
transactions with 24/7 cross-border payment capabilities, programmable
payments, and enhanced supply chain management features leveraging
blockchain technology.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 POLYGLOBE: A MAP-NATIVE INTERFACE FOR GEOPOLITICS MARKETS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 PolyGlobe has introduced a spatial way to browse prediction markets.
Traders can now explore elections, conflicts, and macro events via a
world map, with narratives clustered by region. An AI engine geotags
markets by extracting entities, locations, and coordinates, then
organizes them into regional storylines. Upcoming features include
map-native search, OSINT overlays (integrating live tweets, flight
tracking, and troop movements), and smarter filters, alerts, and
watchlists. The goal is to make geopolitics trading more intuitive,
visual, and context-rich, moving beyond lists of markets to a dynamic,
intelligence-style interface. 

 WORLD LIBERTY FINANCIAL WILL SOON LAUNCH DEBIT CARD (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 World Liberty Financial will launch a debit card and retail
application "very soon" to integrate its USD1 stablecoin into everyday
payments, including Apple Pay integration, co-founder Zak Folkman
announced at Korea Blockchain Week 2025. The retail app will merge
peer-to-peer transfers with trading features, forming the core of
World Liberty's consumer market expansion strategy beyond its current
DeFi offerings. The Trump family-backed project has also signed a
memorandum of understanding with South Korean exchange Bithumb to
explore business opportunities, though specific details of the
partnership remain unclear at this time.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT PREDICTION MARKETS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi have moved beyond
speculation, processing $35B+ since inception and $17.5B in 2025 YTD.
Kalshi is leaning heavily into sports (96% of recent volume), while
Polymarket skews political and long-tail cultural events. Both face
limits from full collateralization and oracle/review structures, yet
their growth suggests prediction markets are maturing into one of
finance's most speculative and democratizing frontiers. 

 SOLANA'S RECENT HIGHLIGHTS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Solana ecosystem momentum accelerated with two major Digital Asset
Treasury launches: Helius raising $500M backed by Pantera Capital and
Solmate raising $300M from UAE-based investors with Ark Invest
backing, coinciding with the SEC's approval of generic listing
standards, clearing the path for more spot crypto ETFs. Infra
milestones included $1 billion of Bitcoin issued on Solana for the
first time ever, SP3ND launching to enable Amazon purchases with
stablecoins, Orderly Network adding multi-collateral trading support
for SOL and USDT, and Reflect Money launching USDC+, a yield-bearing
stablecoin. The ecosystem's developer activity surged with the first
Solana Mobile Hackathon attracting over 1,000 signups and 276 global
submissions.

 PEERDAS IS ETHEREUM'S SCALING UNLOCK (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Fusaka's headline feature, PeerDAS, lets nodes verify block data by
sampling chunks instead of storing full blobs, enabling safer, cheaper
L2 data posting today and future L1 scaling. Blob usage just hit six
per block for the first time. Counts will rise conservatively at
first, then more aggressively as the network hardens. Longer term,
even L1 execution data could migrate into blobs, opening more
throughput without sacrificing decentralization. 

 BASE'S NEXT AGE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Base has doubled DeFi TVL to $5B since spring, with Aave and Morpho
leading growth (Morpho's BTC-backed loans hit $720M). Tech upgrades
like Flashblocks (200ms block times) and Stage 1 decentralization have
drawn praise from Vitalik Buterin. A Solana bridge and the new Base
App (chat, trade, post, and discover apps) push Base further into
mainstream UX, already distributing $500K+ to creators.
