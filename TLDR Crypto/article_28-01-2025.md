MARKETS & BUSINESS

 PUMP.FUN SET SINGLE-DAY REVENUE RECORD, RAKING IN $15.5 MILLION IN
FEES FOLLOWING ANNIVERSARY (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pump.fun, a Solana-based memecoin launcher, achieved a record $15.5
million in single-day revenue on January 24 driven largely by the
launch of Vine Coin, which reached a $425 million market cap amid
speculation about the video platform's potential revival. The platform
has processed $4 billion in the past two weeks and accumulated 2.5
million SOL in fees since launch. It faces new competition from
Juptier's acquisition of rival platform Moonshot and potential legal
challenges from investors who experienced losses on the platform. 

 KUCOIN PLEADS GUILTY TO US CHARGES, AGREES TO PAY $300M (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Crypto exchange KuCoin has pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed
money-transmitting business in the US, agreeing to a $300 million
settlement and a two-year exit from the US market. Founders Michael
Gan and Eric Tang will step down from management roles and forfeit
$2.7 million after the Justice Department found that the platform
operated without KYC or AML procedures until mid-2024. US regulators
have collected over $19 billion in crypto-related settlements since
October 2024.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING THE VENICE TOKEN: VVV (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Venice.ai has launched VVV, a novel token designed to provide AI
agents and users with zero-marginal-cost access to its uncensored AI
model API through staking. 25% of the initial supply was airdropped to
AI community protocols on Base and another 25% to Venice's existing
users. The token has a unique economic model where stakers receive a
pro-rata share of Venice's inference capacity without per-request
fees, while also earning staking yields. The platform, founded by
prominent Bitcoiner Erik Vorhees, emphasizes privacy and censorship
resistance in AI interactions. 

 ABSTRACT MAINNET NOW LIVE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Abstract, a consumer-oriented L2 created by the team behind Pudgy
Penguins, is now live on mainnet. It has a wallet with various funding
options and the ability to earn XP and badges that will likely result
in an Abstract token allocation. The Portal and Discover page
highlight apps, live streams, and trending tokens in one simplified
interface. The L2 is built using ZKSync's rollup technology. It faced
some criticism for a seemingly rushed rollout.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHEN ROBOTS START PAYING EACH OTHER: THE AI-IOT ECONOMY IS COMING (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The convergence of IoT, AI agents, and blockchain will enable
autonomous devices to conduct commerce without human intervention.
While previous IoT visions faced numerous technical and practical
limitations, the combination of advanced AI capabilities, DePIN, and
blockchain-based payment systems is making machine-to-machine commerce
increasingly feasible. This new form of commerce could drive
unprecedented GDP growth by allowing devices to autonomously
negotiate, transact, and optimize resources in real time. 

 ROYCO PRESENTS: BOYCO (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Royco's Cross-Chain Deposit Module (CCDM) revolutionizes blockchain
launches by enabling users to earn transparent rewards for asset
commitments across chains. Its first implementation, Boyco, on
Berachain, simplifies liquidity provisioning and has already secured
$2.2 billion in pre-deposits, signaling a game-changing approach to
ecosystem growth.
