 BANK OF ENGLAND CONFIRMS PLANS FOR STABLECOIN HOLDING LIMITS (5
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Bank of England confirmed plans to introduce "temporary"
stablecoin holding limits of £20,000 per coin for individuals and
£10 million for businesses, with exemptions for exchanges and large
merchants, inviting industry criticism that the rules exceed US and EU
restrictions. Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden defended the caps as
necessary to protect the commercial banking sector that underpins
mortgages, while the BOE proposed issuers back stablecoins with 60%
short-term UK government debt and 40% Bank of England accounts. The
framework applies only to sterling-denominated systemic stablecoins
used for retail payments and wholesale settlement. Consultation will
run until February before final rules are published later next year. 

 SENATE AG RELEASES DRAFT OF CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE LEGISLATION (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Senate Agriculture Committee released a draft crypto market
structure bill that defines CFTC oversight of spot markets, though
bracketed sections show lawmakers haven't finalized key provisions,
including DeFi developer protections and CFTC commissioner
requirements. The legislation must be combined with the Senate Banking
Committee's version before advancing, a process complicated by
internal Republican disagreements and Senator Elizabeth Warren's
objections over industry risks and Trump's crypto stake. The bill
directs CFTC and SEC to jointly develop rules on portfolio margining
and intermediary oversight while defining blockchain-related terms
under the Commodity Exchange Act. Senate floor passage may slip to Q1
2026 despite Trump's original August deadline as committees work
through amendments and stakeholder negotiations.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE LAUNCHES PLATFORM FOR DIGITAL TOKEN OFFERINGS (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Coinbase launched a token sales platform that offers retail investors
access to digital assets before exchange listing, marking the first US
public token offerings since the 2018 ICO crash that led to regulatory
crackdowns and billions in losses. The platform will host monthly
sales with algorithmic allocation during one-week windows, featuring
anti-dumping mechanisms including reduced allocations for immediate
sellers and six-month lockups for issuers and affiliates. Monad will
debut next week as the first project. Coinbase has committed to list
all tokens sold through the platform as part of its strategy to
diversify beyond trading fees and build an "everything exchange" for
blockchain-based financial services. 

 SQUARE BITCOIN PAYMENTS GO LIVE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Square activated Bitcoin payments for 4 million US merchants with
zero processing fees through 2027, enabling Lightning Network
transactions that convert instantly to USD or remain in BTC at
merchant discretion. The platform allows businesses to automatically
convert up to 50% of daily sales into Bitcoin for treasury holdings.
Internal surveys show 29% of businesses exploring conversions and 89%
of interested merchants planning long-term BTC accumulation.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 DEBUNKING AERODROME FUD: EMISSIONS ≠ INFLATION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Token emissions don't automatically cause hyperinflation. Nearly half
of all AERO is locked, removing it from circulation and keeping real
inflation around 5.6%, comparable to gold. Emissions aren't cash burn,
they're equity distribution. Aerodrome generates $185M annualized
revenue with zero dollar outflow while veAERO holders earn all
protocol income plus rebases. With 49% of supply locked, 60% Base DEX
market share, and partners like Coinbase and Circle, Aerodrome is
following the blitzscaling playbook used by Amazon and Google to
dominate markets. 

 UNISWAP TOKEN INCREASE AFTER FEE SWITCH PROPOSAL (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Uniswap's UNI token increased 41.5% in 24 hours and 83% over the week
following the "UNIfication" proposal that activates protocol fees to
fund a perpetual token burn, including a one-time retroactive burn of
roughly 100 million tokens from the treasury. The DEX generates $650
million in daily volume and over $2 billion in annualized fees, but
has lacked a mechanism to return value to token holders until now. The
overhaul introduces MEV discount auctions, eliminates front-end
interface fees, and deploys v4 "aggregator hooks" to turn Uniswap into
an onchain aggregator that collects fees on external liquidity while
deepening its competitive moat against centralized exchanges.

 COINBASE ICO PLATFORM SIGNALS A NEW ERA FOR US CRYPTO REGULATION (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Coinbase's upcoming ICO platform is the clearest signal yet that the
CLARITY Act, legislation redefining token launches as legal capital
formation tools, is on track to pass. What was once considered a
criminal offense in the US is transforming into a regulated framework
for startups to raise capital, distribute ownership, and return
profits through buybacks or dividends. This shift could mark a turning
point for the global crypto industry, enabling open, compliant
tokenized capital markets accessible to builders and investors
worldwide. 

 USDC FACES REGULATORY SPLIT BETWEEN US AND EU FRAMEWORKS (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Circle has just 12 months to address a fundamental regulatory
conflict. USDC cannot comply with both the EU's MiCA framework and the
US GENIUS Act under a single token structure. MiCA mandates 30% of
reserves be held in EU banks, while GENIUS requires 100% backing in US
Treasuries, making dual compliance impossible. This could force Circle
to issue two separate tokens (USDC-US and USDC-EU), splitting $35B in
liquidity. This would fragment DeFi liquidity pools, regional
redemption limits, and likely cause price divergence between the two
versions, marking a major challenge for stablecoin interoperability
across regulatory borders.
