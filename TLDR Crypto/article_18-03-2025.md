 SEC COMMISSIONER HESTER PEIRCE ON THE NEW CRYPTO TASK FORCE (20
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, head of the new crypto task force
launched under Chairman Mark Uyeda, plans to reshape the SEC's
approach to digital assets by providing regulatory clarity and paths
forward for the industry. The task force seeks to delineate SEC
jurisdiction, offer short-term guidance, engage the public to address
issues like tokenized securities, and ease industry frustrations with
past enforcement-driven policies. Peirce emphasized Congress' role in
clarifying stablecoin legislation and market structure, which could
define regulatory boundaries between the SEC and CFTC amid growing
crypto adoption. 

 ACTING SEC CHAIR UYEDA DIRECTS STAFF TO REEXAMINE PROPOSED CRYPTO
CUSTODY RULE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda instructed agency staff to revisit the
proposed crypto custody rule, which was introduced under the previous
leadership. The SEC may adjust the rule's requirements or
implementation timeline to better reflect the current administration's
more crypto-friendly stance.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHENA PARTNERS WITH SECURITIZE TO LAUNCH CONVERGE (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Ethena and Securitize have joined forces to launch Converge, a new
blockchain ecosystem where Ethena's USDe stablecoin and Securitize's
tokenized RWAs (including BlackRock's BUIDL) can coexist, enabling
both permissionless DeFi and compliant onchain finance. The goal is to
bring institutional capital and real-world assets onchain using
Ethena's existing integrations and Securitize's relationships with
major asset managers. 

 ROBINHOOD TEAMS UP WITH KALSHI TO LAUNCH PREDICTION MARKETS HUB
FOCUSING ON POLITICS, ECONOMICS, AND SPORTS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Robinhood has partnered with Kalshi to launch a new prediction
markets hub that focuses on politics, economics, and sports. The

across these sectors.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 FIRST PRINCIPLES - COMPOUNDERS, L1S, IR, BUYBACKS (20 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Crypto has a chronic issue with short-termism, and builders should
instead focus on “compounders”—long-term, revenue-generating
assets like Jito ($900M annualized) and Uniswap ($700M)—by fostering
high-integrity leadership and products with clear profitability paths
to counter memecoin fatigue. Similarly, generalized layer 1s are
failing, while those in specific verticals (e.g., Hyperliquid's perp
trading) drive ecosystem demand. Liquid token projects should adopt
investment relations (IR) roles and quarterly reports to build
investor trust while dismissing buybacks in favor of reinvestment in
growth. 

 THE L2 VS L1 BATTLE THAT NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 L2s hold a structural advantage over L1s in supporting decentralized
applications by using centralized block producers to quickly implement
fee-sharing and MEV taxes, augmenting app revenue while minimizing
costs. L1s are constrained by validator profitability whereas L2s only
carry the sequencer's expense with no capital requirements. This
competition drives a shift toward profit-driven, long-term crypto
apps, aligning with positive regulatory clarity for DeFi and
increasing institutional interest.

 BURNING QUANTUM-VULNERABLE BTC IS THE BEST OPTION (2 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Instead of allowing quantum computers to recover lost Bitcoin and
undermine the network's core principles, vulnerable BTC should be
burned to protect its integrity. Quantum recovery would redistribute
wealth to those with advanced quantum technology, posing a significant
threat to the network's integrity and fairness. Debates are ongoing
about how legitimate the threat of quantum computing is to Bitcoin and
when the network will need to take a hard stance. 

 US COURT ALLOWS 3AC TO EXPAND FTX CLAIM TO $1.5 BILLION; FTX ARGUES
REORGANIZATION PLAN AT RISK (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware ruled in favor
of Three Arrows Capital (3AC), allowing it to increase its claim
against FTX from $120 million to $1.53 billion, despite FTX's
objection that the motion was untimely and would disrupt its
reorganization plan. The court found that FTX's delays in sharing
records, not 3AC's diligence, caused the delay. 3AC's claim stems from
its 2022 collapse amid liquidity issues following the Terra-Luna
ecosystem's implosion.
