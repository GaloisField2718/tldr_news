MARKETS & BUSINESS

 WITH TRUMP'S BACKING, SENATE TO VOTE ON OVERTURNING CONTROVERSIAL
CRYPTO TAX RULE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The U.S. Senate voted 70-28 to overturn a controversial crypto tax
rule requiring custodial brokers (e.g. DeFi companies) to collect and
report user data to the IRS. The resolution, backed by Trump, now
moves to the House for a vote before potentially becoming law, amid
industry concerns over privacy and innovation. 

 IMF DEAL TO BAN PUBLIC SECTOR ‘BITCOIN ACCUMULATION' IN EL SALVADOR
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The IMF's new $1.4B loan deal to El Salvador bans the government from
voluntarily accumulating any additional Bitcoin and bars public sector
debt issuance indexed to or denominated in BTC. This measure follows
prior IMF warnings over El Salvador's Bitcoin adoption, further
restricting official Bitcoin-related economic activities in the
country.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 [ARFC] AAVENOMICS IMPLEMENTATION: PART ONE (19 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Aave Community Initiative (ACI) has proposed the first phase of
implementing updated "Aavenomics," seeking governance approval to
establish an Aave Finance Committee (AFC) for managing treasury assets
and optimizing liquidity incentives. Key changes include phasing out
legacy LEND token migration, introducing “Anti-GHO” rewards for
AAVE stakers to enhance protocol revenue redistribution, and launching
a $1M/week AAVE buyback program to bolster long-term token
sustainability. 

 TRUST WALLET'S FEBRUARY UPDATE (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trust Wallet's February updates include support for XRP Ledger, Sonic
Blockchain integration, improved Bitcoin swaps, and ETH hardware
wallet support. The team also hit 197M downloads, hosted global
community events, and featured deep dives with industry leaders. 

 ZORA TOKEN LAUNCHING IN SPRING 2025 (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Collectibles-oriented L2 Zora is launching the ZORA token in the
coming months. With over 2 million collectors and 600,000 creators,
the platform has generated nearly $30 million in rewards and $376
million in volume. The token will launch on Base, with 10% rewarded to
users via retroactive airdrop.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MY "BEARISH" 2025 CRYPTO PLAN (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A DeFi investor outlines a cautious 2025 crypto strategy,
anticipating a shift toward yield-generating stablecoins (e.g., USDe,
DAI) and U.S.-aligned assets amid fading memecoin hype and stagnant
altcoins. He predicts DeFi innovations leveraging stablecoins'
composability and Trump-era pro-crypto policies—such as regulatory
easing and domestic token incentives—could drive growth. Stablecoin
adoption and U.S.-focused projects like SOL and XRP are flagged as key
areas to monitor in a bearish market. 

 BEST STABLECOIN YIELDS OF MARCH 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Even though the market is down, stablecoin yields remain high, with
Berachain pools offering up to 20% APR and Pendle fixed rates reaching
19% on various stablecoins. New entrants like Midas RWA are emerging
with yield strategies backed by major financial players, while
established platforms like Dolomite and Contango continue to offer
leveraged, therefore riskier, yields between 40-120% APR.

 ACROSS RAISES $41M (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Across has secured $41M in a strategic token sale led by Paradigm,
with backing from major investors like Bain Capital Crypto and
Coinbase Ventures. Despite market turbulence, the team remains focused
on building infrastructure to unify Ethereum. 

 DISTRIBUTED TRAINING IS THE FUTURE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Recent technological breakthroughs have validated the feasibility of
distributed AI model training over standard connection rails,
challenging the notion that AI development requires centralized data
centers and massive capital expenditure. Protocols like Prime
Intellect, Nous Research, and Gensyn are launching solutions combining
blockchain as the coordination layer and crypto-economic incentives to
create global GPU networks. Each project is taking different
approaches to verification, coordination, and value capture, and could
compete with centralized providers. 

 THE LAST CYCLE: AN ETH DENVER RETROSPECTIVE (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The crypto industry is transitioning from speculative trading toward
practical business applications, as evidenced by ETH Denver 2024's
focus on institutional adoption and real-world utility. There are
fewer “crypto mercenaries” and more high-quality entrants from
traditional finance and technology sectors working on stablecoins, AI,
and DePIN projects. While token markets face uncertainty due to
regulatory changes, the industry appears to be moving toward a
bifurcated future where regulated, KYC-compliant financial products
coexist with traditional crypto markets.

 THE CRYPTO LAW ALPHABET SOUP OF THE UAE (5 MINUTE READ) [17]

DMCC, DIFC, and ADGM), and various government initiatives designed to
bolster innovation. 

 RECESSION, INFLATION, AND CRYPTO (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Rob Hadick believes the Trump administration appears to be steering
the U.S. toward a recession, possibly to justify major spending cuts

easing, and subsidies.
