 NY ATTORNEY GENERAL TRIPLES HER ACCUSATIONS AGAINST GEMINI, DCG,
SEEKS $3B (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 New York Attorney General Letitia James increased the restitution
demand from Gemini Trust and Digital Currency Group to $3 billion over
alleged fraud with its Gemini Earn product. Initially, the lawsuit
sought only $1.1 billion for allegedly swindling investors. This
increase comes from additional investors coming forth claiming they
had been defrauded. The complaint accuses Gemini of falsely promoting
Earn as a highly liquid investment and misleading investors about
Genesis Capital's creditworthiness. 

 AS SAM BANKMAN-FRIED AWAITS PRISON SENTENCE, FTX CUSTOMERS AWAIT A
SURPRISE (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is set to be sentenced next month for
fraud charges related to the sudden collapse of his crypto exchange.
His former customers are looking forward to full reimbursements of
their lost funds. The firm's bankruptcy lawyers expect to fully repay
its customers following a resurgence in the crypto market and
appreciation of FTX's venture investments. Even with ongoing
complexities in disbursing the recovered funds, this positive
development is a far better outcome than most had expected.

 CELLMATES: A NEW FRACTIONALIZED NFT DESIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new token called CellMates is rolling out a hybrid ERC-20 and
ERC-721 token that, similarly to ERC404, provides an aspect of
fungibility to NFTs, making them tradeable on both NFT marketplaces
and DEXs. Unlike ERC404s and other tokens, this approach allows the
same NFT to be traded and retain its attributes and rarity. This
differs from the reroll technique that ERC404s utilize upon NFT
transfer. 

 STTIA EXPANSION: STRIDE EXPANDS TO THE MODULAR ECOSYSTEM WITH
HYPERLANE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stride, a protocol focused on liquid staking, has successfully
launched stTIA, which has quickly become one of Celestia's largest
time lock tokens. Stride's unique focus produces high security and
uptime, making it the perfect hub for TIA and stTIA. Hyperlane, an
adaptable interoperability solution, is used to interact with the
modular ecosystem. Stride and Hyperlane's collaboration on this design
promises to provide stTIA access to non-IBC chains within the next two
months.

 CRITIQUING DEPIN: FALSE HOPE OR REAL DAWN? (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article provides an in-depth analysis of Decentralized Physical
Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) and the latest developments in the
vertical. It delves into DePIN's conceptual breakdown and its
complexities and opportunities and presents case studies on Helium's
5G network and io.net AI/ML. Despite challenges remaining in the
space, there is optimism around DePIN's future and its potential to

factors such as value anchors, token incentives, and strong community
engagement. 

 SOLANA & ETHEREUM TRANSACTION FEE MECHANISMS: PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE
SOLANA‚ÄôS TFM (27 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article investigates transaction fee market mechanisms (TFMs)
and issues on both Ethereum and Solana. It discusses how Ethereum's
EIP-1559 fee mechanism could not exactly be ported to Solana due to
the different engineering and performance goals of the two
blockchains. This led to the development of the Program Rebatable
Account Write fees and a proposal for the implementation of
per-account local fee markets. Continued research and experimentation
are needed to improve the efficiency and user-friendliness of TFMs.

 FTX FILES TO SELL SUBSIDIARY ACQUIRED FOR $10 MILLION TO COINLIST FOR
$500,000 (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The FTX estate is reportedly planning to sell its subsidiary Digital
Custody Inc. to CoinList for $500,000 despite acquiring it for $10
million in 2022. The sale is financed by Terence Culver, the former
CEO of Digital Custody. According to FTX's lawyers, the reason for the
sale is the company's inability to revive FTX.US, which rendered
Digital Custody useless to its business. The deal allows FTX time to
find a better offer. 

 VITALIK ON ASKING SECURITY QUESTIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Vitalik Buterin argues that as AI advances, cryptography alone is
insufficient in protecting you from losing self-custodied crypto
funds. One proposal he lays out, particularly effective for personal
interactions, is the use of intricate security questions around shared
experiences or information known just to the individuals involved.
Pairing such strategies with code words, multiple verification
channels, and transaction delays can create a robust, human-friendly
security approach suited to this expanding threat.
