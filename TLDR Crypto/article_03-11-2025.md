MARKETS & BUSINESS

 EU MULLS SEC-LIKE OVERSIGHT FOR STOCK, CRYPTO EXCHANGES (5 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The European Commission is drafting a proposal to expand ESMA's
jurisdiction over stock and crypto exchanges, crypto asset service
providers, and trading infrastructure. This would create SEC-like
central oversight to replace fragmented national regulators that raise
cross-border costs and hinder EU startup development. The move
addresses concerns about regulatory arbitrage under MiCA, which took
effect in December 2024, allowing licenses from one EU state to
"passport" across all 27 nations, prompting France, Austria, and Italy
to call for ESMA supervision of major crypto firms. 

 BLOCKWORKS SHUTTERS ITS NEWS DIVISION (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Blockworks shut down its news division, launched in 2021, to focus on
its rapidly growing data and analytics business. The company will
expand Blockworks Intelligence while maintaining newsletters,
podcasts, and its Digital Asset Summit. The newsroom earned citations
from Bloomberg, Reuters, and The Wall Street Journal during its
four-year run.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ONCHAIN FELLOWSHIP LAUNCHES TO HELP BUILDERS GO ONCHAIN (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The Onchain Fellowship has officially launched, opening applications
to developers and creators worldwide after onboarding 40+ builders in
its first week. The initiative's goal is to bring more people onchain
by helping engineers and creatives build mini-apps on Base, starting
with its first cohort in Pakistan. The project is already live at
onchainfellowship.com. It is aiming to grow a global community of
hands-on builders to shape the onchain ecosystem. 

 DARE MARKET: THE MOST UNHINGED PLATFORM ON THE INTERNET (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Dare Market is a platform for proof-based challenges where users
stake real money on completing public dares. The platform enforces
strict anti-fraud rules, including immediate account deletion for fake
proof or scams, with no tolerance for illegal activity, direct harm,
hate, or content manipulation, despite encouraging chaos and
boundary-pushing within those limits. The goal of the app is to enable
a trustless market for attention through authentic, bold stunts that
generate genuine proof and cultural moments.

 THE THREE CLASSES OF CRYPTO (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are three classes in the crypto ecosystem: commercial, casino,
and cypherpunk. Commercial crypto includes RWAs, stablecoins, and
institutional systems focused on efficiency but riddled with hidden
centralization risks like freeze functions and sequencer control.
Casino crypto is speculative and profit-driven, and thrives in
regulatory gray zones. The rarest, cypherpunk crypto, stays true to
the industry's roots and uses cryptography to build
censorship-resistant systems that preserve individual freedom. 

 THE NFT DEATH SPIRAL (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 BAYC's floor price sits at $25,000 (down 93% from May 2022 peak)
despite major brand collaborations with BMW and Amazon, while
September 2024 NFT volume hit the lowest since 2021 at $300 million as
whales controlling 24% of ETH volume and nearly half of Solana volume
departed for liquid markets like perps and prediction markets.
Strategy tokens like PunkStrategy provide limited relief by adding
single synthetic whales while the market struggles with 10,000-piece
collections designed for demand that can only support 500 active
traders at price points far exceeding addressable market capacity.
Hyperliquid's Hypurr NFTs achieved the only success story this cycle
with a $65,700 floor, $300 million market cap, and 90% unique owner
distribution versus a typical 50% by airdropping 4,600 NFTs for free
to active network participants rather than selling promises.

 ONCHAIN STABLECOIN CREDIT COULD RESHAPE CONSUMER LENDING (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Stablecoins and onchain lending protocols could overhaul the $1.2T
unsecured consumer credit market, currently dominated by credit cards.
Unlike traditional systems reliant on slow settlement and opaque
securitizations, onchain credit enables issuers to tokenize
receivables, secure instant liquidity from decentralized pools, and
automate repayment through smart contracts. This model replaces credit
card funding via ABS markets with transparent, programmable lending
pools, each tailored to borrower profiles or purchase categories.
Stablecoin rails, already bridging fiat and crypto payments, could
soon make borrowing and lending as fluid as transacting online,
transforming unsecured credit into an open, global marketplace. 

 ZKSYNC ATLAS QUIETLY POSITIONS ETHEREUM AS DEFI'S CAPITAL HUB (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ZKsync's Atlas upgrade may be one of the most underhyped
breakthroughs in crypto, delivering 15k+ TPS, 1-second finality,
near-zero fees, and real-time L1–L2 liquidity flow. Unlike other L2s
that rely on centralized liquidity hubs, Atlas allows ZKsync chains to
tap Ethereum's native liquidity directly, making ETH the financial
backbone for institutional-grade settlement. With this architecture,
ZKsync transforms Ethereum into a real-time capital hub for the
onchain economy.

 ZKSYNC ATLAS MAKES ETHEREUM INSTITUTION-READY (2 MINUTE READ) [13]
