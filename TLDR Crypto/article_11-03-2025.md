MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC TO HALT REQUIRING CRYPTO FIRMS TO REGISTER AS TRADING SYSTEMS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The SEC will no longer require crypto firms to register as trading
systems, signaling a shift toward a more lenient regulatory stance
under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda. This move follows the agency's recent
trend of pausing lawsuits against major crypto firms and aligns with
the pro-crypto policies of the new administration. 

 TRUMP PLANS TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDER ENDING BIDEN-ERA CRYPTO DEBANKING
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order reversing
Biden-era policies that restricted crypto companies' access to banking
services, aiming to roll back “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” The
order may also influence Federal Reserve policies and redefine
stablecoins, marking Trump's third crypto-focused executive action
since returning to office.

 COMPOUND-MORPHO PROPOSAL SPARKS DEBATE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A proposal to launch Compound-Morpho lending vaults on Polygon,
backed by $3M in incentives, has sparked controversy. While it
promises TVL growth and tech upgrades, critics argue Gauntlet's dual
role as Curator and Allocator creates a conflict of interest, with
concerns over future fee structures and potential centralization of
power. The debate highlights ongoing DAO governance challenges.

 WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BUY THE DIP (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Buying the dip isn't always a good idea, especially in speculative
markets like memecoins and NFTs, where price drops don't necessarily
mean an asset is undervalued. Market bubbles deflate slowly,
narratives drive prices, and emotional trading can lead to
losses—while BTC remains bullish long-term, patience might offer
better opportunities. 

 IS IT A SONIC BOOM? (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Sonic, the next iteration of the Fantom blockchain, is a significant
upgrade capable of 10,000 TPS and one-second finality through

 BEST BTC YIELDS IN DEFI (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 BTC has historically been an asset without many yield opportunities.
However, the rise of BTCfi and points programs has unlocked ~5% APY on
crypto's largest asset. Solv Protocol has numerous options for
BTC-neutral strategies combining borrowing a yield-bearing asset with
BTC longs. Berachain BTC deposits on Pendle Finance are paying a fixed
10%, with Lombard Finance LBTC positions paying slightly less. 

 CONFESSIONS OF A CRYPTO MARKETER (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Traditional marketing strategies like SEO and paid ads largely fail
in crypto due to unique challenges like rapid market shifts, short
user attention spans, and strict advertising regulations. Effective
crypto marketing instead revolves around real-time community
engagement, continuous education, transparency, and an integrated
approach encompassing community management, product development, and
customer support. Crypto marketing is less about conventional
techniques and more about immersive community building, continuous
education, authenticity, and responsiveness to user needs.
