MARKETS & BUSINESS

 MONAD TOKEN SALE ENDS OVERSUBSCRIBED ON COINBASE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Monad's MON public sale on Coinbase, initially feared to be a flop
after an early slowdown, closed at roughly $216 million raised in
USDC, about 115% of its $187 million target as a last-minute wave of
commitments came in. The oversubscribed sale, which offered 7.5% of
MON's 100 billion supply, doubles as the first major stress test of
Coinbase's new token sale platform. It signals strong retail interest
in Monad's high-performance EVM-compatible L1 despite cooler
conditions than MegaETH's blockbuster raise. 

 DNS ATTACK KNOCKS AERODROME AND VELODROME FRONT-ENDS OFFLINE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Base's Aerodrome and Optimism's Velodrome suffered a DNS hijack that
redirected users from their primary domains to scam front-ends,
forcing both DEXs to push traders toward decentralized mirror links
while they work on a fix and emphasize that core smart contracts
remain unaffected. The incident, similar to a 2023 domain compromise,
demonstrates how centralized DNS remains a key security weak point
even for leading DeFi protocols and comes just months before the
projects merge into a unified Aero platform.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 FANATICS ENTERS PREDICTION MARKETS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Fanatics announced a prediction markets platform launching within
weeks through a Crypto.com partnership, with CEO Michael Rubin
revealing the news on CNBC but declining to share product details or
operational scope. The sports merchandiser holds licenses in 23 US
states while acknowledging strong demand in the remaining 27, where
regulatory hurdles may limit access. It remains unclear whether the
platform will use crypto rails or focus on sports, given Fanatics'
deep betting and merchandise roots. 

 GRAYSCALE XRP AND DOGECOIN ETFS TO DEBUT NOVEMBER 24 (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Grayscale's XRP and Dogecoin ETFs received SEC approval to begin
trading on November 24 on the NYSE. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas
projects $11 million day-one DOGE volume and that Chainlink ETF
approval will come in the following week. The launches follow Canary
Capital's record-setting XRP ETF debut, with $59 million first-day
volume and $250 million AUM as November's highest-volume 2025 ETF
launch. REX Shares and Osprey Funds already launched a DOGE ETF in
September using the 1940 Investment Company Act.

 ETHER.FI CASH EMERGES AS LEADING CRYPTO NEOBANK (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ether.fi Cash has become the breakout winner in crypto neobanking by
collapsing wallets, yield, and card spending into a single
non-custodial Visa product that lets users borrow against staked and
restaked assets, earn 5–10%+ DeFi yield, and get 3% cashback while
never fully exiting crypto. Backed by Ether.fi's ~$7–11.5 billion
restaking ecosystem, Cash has processed over $114 million in spend,
paid nearly $5 million in rewards, and reached ~5,500 daily active
cards. Metrics like $66,000 annualized spend per active user suggest a
strong product–market fit. A “Triple Dip” rewards program that
ties together vault deposits, card spend, and bank on-ramps acts as a
reflexive growth engine, positioning Ether.fi Cash as the leading
non-custodial alternative to fintech-style crypto cards and a
blueprint for on-chain neobanking. 

 STATE OF CRYPTO (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto shows strong fundamental signals, including Stripe's Tempo
SWIFT/ACH disruption ambitions, Citadel's $200 million Kraken
investment, and $35 billion total RWA value, yet "fun crypto" has
become compressed as average participants struggle to profit while
research analysis fails to translate into trading returns. Public
token sales at $1-2.5 billion valuations like Monad and MegaETH don't
replicate early-stage venture exposure, creating a disconnect where
only majors are recommendable despite DePIN revenues growing 400%
year-over-year and monthly application revenue hitting $400 million.
Upcoming research priorities include DePIN tokenomics reconciling
strong sector growth with poor token performance, DeAI agent
infrastructure and agentic payments via x402, Tempo's explicit
positioning as a SWIFT alternative rather than a PayPal competitor,
and internet capital markets exploring whether launchpad design or
founder quality matters more after Believe's struggles versus
MetaDAO's success.

 BLOB FEES, L2S, AND WHY BLOBS ARE JUST GETTING STARTED (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 If all Ethereum blobs were sold at the average per-byte rate paid by
perp appchain Lighter over the past three days, L1 blob revenue would
be about 5x higher (~$52 million per year), highlighting early but
growing, relatively price-insensitive demand for data availability.
Lighter currently pays 6x more per blob than Base (13x more per byte
once normalized for fullness) while spending a smaller share of its L2
revenue on blobs thanks to highly optimized Data availability (DA) and
zk state diffs, suggesting that efficient, high-margin L2s could drive
blob fees up and force less efficient rollups toward higher costs or
alternative DA, with blob revenue becoming “icing on the cake” for
ETH. 

 BITCOIN DOESN'T HOLD CRYPTO HOSTAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ethereum is technically and economically independent of Bitcoin and
would continue running its stablecoin rails, DeFi ecosystem, and ETH
burn even if Bitcoin vanished. Quantum-computing risks currently
spooking Bitcoin are largely Bitcoin-specific, since Ethereum has long
hidden public keys behind addresses and plans to adopt quantum-safe
signatures. This suggests that in a true Bitcoin failure scenario, ETH
would likely inherit Bitcoin's monetary premium as the default money
of the internet rather than see “internet money” die altogether.
