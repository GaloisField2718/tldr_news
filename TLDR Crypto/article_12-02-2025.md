 MY DATA IS NOT MINE: PRIVACY LAYERS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are four main categories of privacy-preserving technologies
that the AI x Crypto sector utilizes. Zero-knowledge proofs allow for
verification without data exposure and are being used by Grass.io for
secure data collection. zkTLS allows for secure data transmission and
private storage solutions. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like
Phala Network and Fully Homomorphic Encryption from Mind Network allow
agents to own their private keys securely and autonomously. 

 THERE ARE NO GOOD MARKETING AGENCIES (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article explores the reality that marketing agencies, especially
in the crypto space, often fail to live up to expectations,
highlighting issues like lack of brand understanding and inadequate
creative efforts. It argues that agencies should only be used for
specific tasks, and projects are better off hiring in-house marketing
professionals who are immersed in the industry for long-term success.

 MORE $HAWK CONTROVERSY (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 After the notorious launch of the $HAWK coin from Hailey Welch a
couple of months ago, which resulted in an immediate pump and dump,
prominent influencer FaZe Banks agreed to go on her first podcast and
give her a chance to explain the coin's issues. His explicit requests
to only share the episode after a resolution had been found and not
leaking the episode were both broken, as the episode was leaked and
insider trading occurred on the token days before. 

 THE WORLD'S VALUE WILL BE TOKENIZED (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Variant Fund has invested in Whetstone (the team that created
Doppler, a new token issuance protocol on Unichain aimed at improving
asset launches, liquidity bootstrapping, and community building).
Doppler addresses key issues like bot-dominated launches, poor
composability, and lack of trust by introducing anti-sniper pricing
curves, open-source design, and built-in vesting.
