CRYPTO EXCHANGE BACKED BY CITADEL SECURITIES, FIDELITY, SCHWAB STARTS
OPERATIONS (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/8tbG1?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

EDX Markets, a cryptocurrency exchange backed by Citadel Securities,
Fidelity Investments, and Charles Schwab, recently launched, quietly
beginning to execute trades in the past few weeks. The platform aims
to differentiate itself by operating as a noncustodial exchange, thus
not directly handling customers' assets. Instead, it serves as a
marketplace for firms to negotiate prices and settle trades
independently. EDX intends to target brokers and institutional
investors rather than individual ones. As of now, the exchange plans
to list only four cryptocurrencies - BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH, aiming to
avoid potential issues with the SEC. 

BLACKROCK, THEN BITWISE â€” HOW THE SPOT BITCOIN ETF FILINGS DIFFER (3
MINUTE READ)
[https://blockworks.co/news/blackrock-bitwise-bitcoin-etf-filings?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

Bitwise has revived its proposal for a spot Bitcoin ETF following a
similar move by BlackRock and rumors of Fidelity pursuing one as well,
even though the SEC has never approved such an offering. The Bitwise
filing, like BlackRock's, emphasizes surveillance of Bitcoin via the
CME futures markets. Analysts suggest Bitwise's move is a direct
response to BlackRock's bid, and both filings cite the SEC's approval
of a Bitcoin futures fund by Teucrium as a precedent. The outcome of
Grayscale Investments' lawsuit against the SEC could further influence
the prospects for approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.

OPTIMISTIC POOL - A UNIVERSAL CO-PROCESSOR FOR ETHEREUM MAINNET (8
MINUTE READ)
[https://ethresear.ch/t/optimistic-pool-a-universal-co-processor-for-ethereum-mainnet/15903?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

This proposal introduces the concept of an optimistic pool as a
co-processor to Ethereum mainnet. It explains that an optimistic pool
is a universal contract that offloads computations off-chain and
validates them more efficiently on-chain, similar to roll-ups but
without holding user tokens. The article mentions existing examples of
co-processors being developed, such as WAX and Axiom. The optimistic
pool being discussed is funded by Nouns DAO and aims to provide a
low-cost solution for checking zk-proofs in a private voting system.
This write-up provides an overview of how the optimistic pool works,
covering claim kinds, blesser priority queue mechanics, and the
blesser payout mechanism. It also suggests potential applications for
the optimistic pool, such as private voting, Tornado Cash contracts,
smart contract wallets, and optimistic aggregation of signatures. 

SUPERCHARGED LIQUIDITY POOLS TO DEPLOY ON OSMOSIS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://blockworks.co/news/supercharged-liquidity-pools-osmosis?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

Osmosis, a decentralized exchange built on the Cosmos network, has
received community approval to deploy supercharged liquidity pools.
This upgrade allows liquidity providers to concentrate their assets
and earn more rewards based on actual usage. The proposal received
over 96% of the community's votes. The first supercharged pool will
involve the DAI/OSMO assets. The migration of existing pools and the
creation of new pools will follow a governance process until all curve
pools on Osmosis are migrated. Whitelisted assets, including OSMO,
USDC, and DAI, will be initially available for permissionless pool
creation. The v16 upgrade is scheduled for late June.

DEEPER DIVE ON CROSS-L2 READING FOR WALLETS AND OTHER USE CASES (25
MINUTE READ)
[https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/06/20/deeperdive.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

This blog from Vitalik discusses the importance of considering L1 +
cross-L2 support, wallet security, and privacy as necessary features
of the ecosystem stack. It focuses on the technical aspects of
enabling easier reading between different layers of the chain and
proposes various proof schemes, including Merkle proofs, ZK-SNARKs,
special-purpose KZG proofs, and Verkle tree proofs. The article also
emphasizes the need to optimize cross-chain proofs, minimize latency,
and preserve privacy in the wallet ecosystem. 

DEFI LESSON: FRAGMENTED LIQUIDITY AND 1INCH (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://mirror.xyz/obchakevich.eth/10Zi94G8wjdFV_Vb3t-UW4SXRMRrdKy8QJ48c-Goun0?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

Fragmented liquidity is a condition in the DeFi market where liquidity
is dispersed among various trading platforms instead of being
concentrated in one pool. This can create challenges in finding
sufficient liquidity, executing trades at desired prices, and ensuring
efficient trading across different protocols. To address this, 1inch,
a liquidity aggregator, combines liquidity from multiple exchanges and
protocols to provide users with optimal prices and efficient
transactions. By aggregating liquidity and splitting trades across
different pools, DEX aggregators minimize slippage and maximize price
efficiency.

POLYGON PROPOSES POS CHAIN TO BECOME ZK COMPATIBLE (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/20/polygon-proposes-pos-chain-to-become-zk-compatible/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

Polygon has proposed an upgrade to its main chain to make it
compatible with ZK tech, an upgrade that would transform the Polygon
POS into a zkEVM validium, maintaining EVM compatibility. The change
would also enhance security, eliminate reorganizations, speed up
transactions, and scale the blockchain. This upgrade is being
considered as part of Polygon 2.0, a rebranding initiative that will
include various announcements about the blockchain, token, and
governance.
