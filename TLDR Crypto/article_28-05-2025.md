MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CIRCLE FILES FOR IPO (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, has filed
for a New York Stock Exchange IPO under the ticker “CRCL.” At the
proposed $24–$26 range, the IPO could raise up to ~$250 million for
Circle and nearly $375 million for selling stakeholders at a valuation
over $5 billion. Major banks J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs
are leading the offering. This move follows a failed 2021 SPAC
attempt, recent SEC S-1 filings, and exploration of a potential $5
billion sale to suitors like Coinbase or Ripple. 

 TRUMP SUPPORTS BILL TO BUY 1 MILLION BTC (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 According to Senator Lummis, the BITCOIN Act, which directs the U.S.
government to acquire one million Bitcoins over five years using
existing Federal Reserve and Treasury funds, has President Trump's
backing. She also revealed a White House team is drafting
digital-asset bills first on stablecoins, then market structure, and
finally a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. The Senate Banking Committee has
already advanced the bipartisan GENIUS Act on stablecoin regulation to
the floor following a 66–32 procedural vote on May 19.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COBIE'S ICO PLATFORM SONAR GOES LIVE WITH PLASMA (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sonar, Echo's platform for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), has
launched with Plasma's XPL token as its debut sale, raising $50
million at a $500 million fully diluted valuation. Pre-deposits open
June 9, followed by a public sale available worldwide, with U.S.
investors subject to a 12-month lockup and most others to a 40-day
lockup. Plasma is a Bitcoin sidechain fully compatible with the EVM
and is in private testnet ahead of a public testnet and late-summer
mainnet launch. This is the first major ICO in several years and
represents a shift in the regulatory landscape and appetite for
consumer participation in early project stages. 

 METAMASK RELEASES SOLANA SUPPORT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 MetaMask's browser extension now natively supports Solana, allowing
users to send, receive, swap, bridge, and purchase Solana-based tokens
and interact with Solana dApps alongside their Ethereum accounts in a
single interface. Solana support on the MetaMask mobile app will
arrive in the coming weeks. MetaMask's security features on Solana
include real-time alerts, malicious dApp detection, and transaction
simulations.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 FROM ZERO USERS TO DEFI KING: THE STORY OF HYPERLIQUID (15 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Hyperliquid's founder Jeff Yan rebounded from a 2018 exchange failure
by launching Hyperliquid's mainnet in February 2023 and organically
growing daily volume from $3 million to $50 million in one month
through relentless technical posting instead of traditional marketing.
Generous cash incentives including testnet prizes, $1 per $10k weekly
trading volume, and referral and open-interest rewards, paired with
rapid listings of trending pairs and the community-owned HLP vault,
drove TVL from $1.5 million to $6 million in 30 days and bumped daily
volume past $1 billion. The November 2023 points program then trained
traders to hold positions, boosting average daily volume from $100
million to $1 billion and cementing loyalty with the largest airdrop
in DeFi history.

 SOLANA CO-FOUNDER'S PERSONAL ID LEAKED IN DATA BREACH (3 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 An apparent hack of the hip-hop group Migos' Instagram account
exposed Solana co-founder Raj Gokal's driver's license, passport,
phone number, and similar personal IDs, as well as those of his wife.
The posts, which threatened that he “should have” paid 40 BTC as
part of a likely blackmail demand and linked to a Telegram group,
remained live for over an hour before removal. Gokal had already
warned on X of recent takeover attempts on his email, social media,
and other accounts.
