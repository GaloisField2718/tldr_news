HK REGULATORS TO HOST MEETING TO HELP CRYPTO FIRMS WITH BANKING (2
MINUTE READ) [https://archive.ph/6JP9m?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

Hong Kong regulators are planning a meeting between crypto firms and
bankers on April 28 to improve financing opportunities for the sector,
as the city aims to become a digital asset hub. The round table,
organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and
Futures Commission, intends to encourage dialogue and share
experiences in opening and maintaining bank accounts. Although Hong
Kong is working to become a center for digital assets and Web3 firms,
strict know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules have made
establishing banking relationships challenging. 

DAO TOKEN HOLDERS ARE PLAUSIBLY LIABLE, JUDGE RULES IN BZX CLASS
ACTION (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theblock.co/post/223237/bzx-dao-liability-class-action?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


A US judge ruled that bZx DAO is plausibly a general partnership,
denying a motion to dismiss token holders as defendants in a
class-action lawsuit focused on a $55 million hack in November 2021.
The court found that plaintiffs provided enough facts to qualify
defendants who hold the DAO's governance tokens as members of the
general partnership, making them potentially liable for the group's
obligations. The court agreed that DAO token holders owed a duty of
care to protocol investors and failed to ensure adequate security.
Plaintiffs claim they lost $1.7 million in the attack.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

LINEA, A DEVELOPER FRIENDLY ZK-ROLLUP, POWERED BY CONSENSYS (3 MINUTE
READ)
[https://linea.mirror.xyz/6G30hwV2wPs_wPv0VEgHYaIdghMkIQaad-OI_0br1hM?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Linea, the next evolution of ConsenSys zkEVM, is an L2 solution for
Ethereum, powering a new generation of decentralized applications. The
testnet has been opened to developers, users, and protocols. Linea
aims to provide a seamless developer experience by integrating with
popular tools like MetaMask and Truffle. The platform leverages
zero-knowledge proofs and full EVM equivalence, enabling scalable
dApps without code changes or smart contract rewriting. Faster
transaction speeds, reduced gas costs, and enhanced composability make
Linea another good potential solution for Ethereum scaling. 

CONDUIT, A CRYPTO NATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORM (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://conduit.xyz/blog/introducing-conduit?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

Conduit is a crypto infrastructure platform designed to accelerate and
empower builders in the crypto space by enabling them to scale
applications using app-specific rollups. By offering a managed rollup
deployment, Conduit allows teams to concentrate on product development
while addressing network congestion and improving user experiences. In
collaboration with the Optimism Foundation, Conduit supports the
Superchain vision, facilitating broader access to rollup deployment.
The platform aims to streamline the deployment process, helping
developers launch their own OP Stack rollups that can eventually
become part of the Superchain.

LEARN EVM ATTACKS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/coinspect/learn-evm-attacks?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This repo contains a collection of Foundry tests that reproduce
exploits, bug bounty reports, and theoretical vulnerabilities on EVM
chains, serving as a valuable reference and study material for
understanding smart contract system vulnerabilities. It includes
diagrams and context links for each attack reproduction. The
repository currently has reproduced exploits, categorized by access
control, bad data validation, business logic, reentrancy, and bridges.
Each vulnerability folder provides instructions to run the
reproduction, requiring only Foundry installation. 

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AMMS AND RFQS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1640764814883520520.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


The tweet thread explains two DeFi liquidity methods: Automated Market
Makers (AMMs) and Request For Quote (RFQs). AMMs, like Uniswap and
Curve Finance, allow users to swap tokens using liquidity pools, with
prices determined by mathematical curves. Liquidity Providers are
incentivized to deposit tokens to earn trading fees. RFQs, like
0xProject, connect buyers and sellers directly, with market makers
offering competitive rates. Both methods facilitate trades, but AMMs
use pool liquidity and curves, while RFQs rely on direct connections
and competition among market makers.

NEWLY FORMED ZEROSYNC ASSOCIATION BRINGS ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOFS TO
BITCOIN (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/28/newly-formed-zerosync-association-brings-zero-knowledge-proofs-to-bitcoin/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Three German computer scientists founded the Swiss nonprofit ZeroSync
Association to scale Bitcoin using zero-knowledge proofs, a popular
cryptographic technique on Ethereum. Zk-proofs allow validation of
information without revealing the data itself. ZeroSync has developed
a prototype to validate the Bitcoin blockchain state and transaction
history without downloading the entire chain or relying on a third
party. Although still a work-in-progress, this proof system could
enable various applications, such as proof-of-reserves on exchanges
and transaction history compression on second-layer protocols like
Lightning Labs' Taro. 

MAKERDAO 'ENDGAME PLAN' RATIFIED IN NEW 'CONSTITUTION' (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theblock.co/post/223134/makerdao-endgame-plan-ratified-in-new-constitution?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


A majority of 76% voted to approve "The Maker Constitution," a
proposal by Maker CEO Rune Christensen, bringing more structure to DAI
issuer MakerDAO. The constitution is part of MakerDAO's "Endgame Plan"
and offers guidance on stability, decentralization, risk, and
governance. It introduces anonymous constitutional conservers who
protect governance and participate in Voter Committees and as
Constitutional Delegates. The constitution also outlines the launch of
six subDAOs focused on governance, real-world asset management, and
decentralization innovation. Additionally, it provides project-based
funding for professional actors offering critical services to subDAOs
and Maker Core.
