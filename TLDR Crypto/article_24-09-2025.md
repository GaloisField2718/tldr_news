 BITCOIN EYES POWELL AND INFLATION DATA AFTER LEVERAGE FLUSH (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin is consolidating below $113K as traders await Fed Chair
Jerome Powell's speech and Friday's core PCE inflation data, which
could shape Q4 momentum. Analysts flagged $115,200 as a key support
holding above opens the door to retesting highs, while a break lower
risks a slide to $105K. After last week's $1.7B leverage flush,
liquidity has returned, whales are accumulating, and options demand is
clustering around $120K–$125K calls, setting up Powell and PCE as
critical near-term catalysts. 

 WHITE HOUSE TARGETS YEAR-END PASSAGE FOR CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE BILL
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Patrick Witt, Executive Director of the White House Council of
Advisors on Digital Assets, said he expects the sweeping crypto market
structure bill to pass before the end of 2025. The legislation
includes the CLARITY Act and the Responsible Financial Innovation Act,
which establish a comprehensive U.S. framework for digital assets,
dividing oversight between the SEC and CFTC.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 KALSHI LAUNCHES CRYPTO PRE-MARKETS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Kalshi's Crypto Pre-Markets let users speculate on events tied to
pre-token projects, like whether PumpFun, OpenSea, Monad, or
Hyperliquid will launch tokens or conduct airdrops. This opens up
tradable exposure to topics that currently lack direct markets,
similar to how Pendle drove adoption via points speculation.
Prediction markets are increasingly becoming a central venue for
crypto-native speculation before tokens exist, giving traders a way to
price in early probabilities. 

 COINBASE ANNOUNCES X402 FOUNDATION WITH CLOUDFLARE (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 x402, the open standard for onchain agentic commerce created by
Coinbase, will become controlled by an independent foundation called
the x402 Foundation. The foundation will be co-founded by Coinbase and
Cloudflare – one of the largest internet infrastructure providers
who recently announced an agentic pay-per-crawl option for websites
– with more partners to be announced soon. Creating a foundation is
a significant step toward making the standard truly open and neutral
and achieving the same relevance and scale as HTTP or DNS.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 FINDINGS FROM TESTING 20+ PREDICTION MARKETS (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Kalshi and Polymarket dominate 99% of the prediction market
landscape. Kalshi captured 63% market share in early September due to
a surge in sports prediction activity. Both platforms actively court
builders with different approaches, targeting crypto Twitter
communities and DeFi ecosystem developers. Five product categories are
emerging across the ecosystem: DeFi protocols enable lending and
borrowing against prediction market positions, with projects like
Gondorfi building AAVE-style infrastructure and Flipr creating
leverage trading platforms; analytics and aggregator tools include
Polysights for AI-enabled dashboards with insider detection, Betmor
for trading terminals, and Poly Data for comprehensive market
analytics; perps products allow users to long/short everything from
pre-IPO companies to quantified public perception and mindshare
trends, and AI applications like Sportstensor's Almanac delivering 72%
ROI on MLB bets and SIRE turning football footage analysis into
trading insights; and niche prediction markets feature decentralized
market creation, gamified experiences, and specialized focus areas. 

 EULERSWAP VS FLUID DEX (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Fluid DEX maintains a structural advantage in non-volatile pairs like
USDC-USDT through a unique Smart Debt feature that turns normal
borrowers into passive liquidity providers by allowing debt to be
denominated as DEX pool shares rather than single assets, reducing
borrowing costs by up to 1.15% APY and creating deeper liquidity than
EulerSwap's market maker-only approach. The data supports this
advantage with Fluid ranking as the #2 DEX on Ethereum with $600
million daily volume versus EulerSwap's #11 ranking with $25 million
daily volume, both driven primarily by non-volatile pairs, while
Fluid's unified liquidity layer pools assets across all markets
compared to Euler's fragmented vault structure. Gas efficiency creates
another significant barrier for EulerSwap on Ethereum mainnet, with
Fluid swaps consuming around 140k gas through simple borrow/repay
operations versus EulerSwap's 390k gas requirements due to oracle
calls, health checks, and vault limit verification. However,
EulerSwap's permissionless vault architecture positions it strongly
for long-tail assets, new stablecoins, and DAO tokens where
flexibility matters more than liquidity depth, with both platforms
ultimately solving different problems rather than directly competing
for the same markets.

 AERODROME REDEFINES DEX TOKENOMICS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Aerodrome has distributed $1 of revenue to $veAERO voters for every
$723 in trading volume, a model that would have paid out $4.3B if
applied to Uniswap's $3.1T in 5-year volume. For comparison, that
equals 88% of UNI's current market cap. However, Uniswap has returned
nothing to token holders. In the past 30 days alone, Aerodrome
distributed $35M to voters, outpacing the combined revenue of
PancakeSwap, Curve, and Jupiter. 

 PENDLE STRATEGY: SHORT-TERM PRINCIPAL TOKENS AND YIELD MAXIMIZATION
(2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Pendle users often target longer-duration principal tokens (PTs) for
fixed yields, but pre-token generation event demand for yield tokens
(YTs) can create attractive opportunities in shorter-term PTs. When
traders buy YTs, their price rises, pushing down PT prices and
boosting PT fixed yields. As shown with USDe pools nearing maturity,
PTs with just two days left were offering extreme yields (15–25%),
thus short-duration PTs can sometimes provide outsized returns if YT
demand spikes near expiry.
