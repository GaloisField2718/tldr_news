MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN TOPS $68K, NEARING SILVER'S $1.38T MARKET CAP (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Bitcoin is approaching its all-time high, eclipsing $68,000. With
this surge in price, Bitcoin is closing in on silver's $1.4 trillion
market cap. Meanwhile, Ethereum also hit a significant milestone,
surpassing $3,700 for the first time since January 2022. This comes on
the back of record inflows into BlackRock and other fundsâ€™ spot
Bitcoin ETFs. 

 BLACKROCK FILES TO PURCHASE MORE BITCOIN ETFS FOR SIO FUND (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Asset manager BlackRock has filed an application with the SEC to
acquire shares of Bitcoin ETFs for its own funds. The firm plans to do
this through its Strategic Income Opportunities Fund. The fundâ€™s ETF
has gained the lead in market share amongst the new spot Bitcoin ETFs
and has done record-breaking levels of trading volume. This move would
allow BlackRock to make investments directly into these ETFs, giving
clients of this fund direct exposure to Bitcoin.

Singapore, has successfully tested its first self-designed 4-nanometer

smaller environmental footprint.

multi-billion dollar airdrop of its W token. The airdrop, which Aevo

for its ability to send assets between blockchains, now claims to have

 HOW TO RAISE THE GAS LIMIT, PART 1: STATE GROWTH (12 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Ethereum's state growth, often seen as a scaling bottleneck, can be
sustained for at least a decade with modern consumer hardware. State,
the set of data necessary for building and validating fresh Ethereum
blocks, can be kept under control using rollups, Verkle tries, and
state expiry. There is a need for empirical methods to engineer
Ethereumâ€™s gas limit and facilitate endgame scaling solutions. 

 FINANCIAL NIHILISM: THE ZEITGEIST OF YOUNG AMERICA (12 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This thread explores financial nihilism, focusing on how it fosters
increased financial risk-taking, particularly among younger
generations. Apparently a response to rising costs of living, income
inequality, and unaffordable housing, financial nihilism leads to
strategic gambling for potential large payoffs, demonstrated in trends
like the rise of 0DTE options and sports betting. Financial Nihilism
is linked to cryptocurrency - it will likely play a large part in
younger generations adopting the technology.

buyers. The company also intends to provide an option to purchase an

 SEC PUSHES BACK BLACKROCK SPOT ETHEREUM ETF APPLICATIONâ€”AGAIN (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The SEC has delayed its decision on BlackRock's proposed Ethereum ETF
for the second time, indicating that other similar applications from
companies like Fidelity, Invesco, and Galaxy Digital could also face
delays. The success of the spot Bitcoin ETFs is increasing interest in
Ethereum ETFs. The delay was mostly expected. Experts are confident
that a decision, likely an approval, will be reached in May.
