 GENSLER WARNS CRYPTO INDUSTRY 'WILL NOT LONG PERSIST' WITHOUT
INVESTOR PROTECTION (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 SEC Chair Gary Gensler warned that the crypto industry won't survive
without stronger investor protections, citing the collapse of major
firms like FTX and Three Arrows Capital as evidence of the need for
regulation. While reiterating that most cryptocurrencies are
securities, he confirmed that Bitcoin remains an exception,
emphasizing the importance of trust and disclosure in sustaining the
sector. 

 BITCOIN RALLIES AMID POSITIVE U.S. JOBS DATA AND REPORTS OF MORE
CHINA STIMULUS MEASURES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin has surged past $65,000, driven by positive U.S. jobs data
and expectations of new economic stimulus from China. While these
developments have sparked optimism in the market, analysts caution
that if Bitcoin fails to hold above this level, it could face
significant downward pressure despite the broader stock market rally.

 HYPERLIQUID: THE HYPEROPTIMIZED ORDER BOOK L1 (1 HOUR READ) [10] 

 Hyperliquid, a perpetual trading protocol with an L1, has become a
disruptor in the trading space, with over $300 billion in cumulative
volumes and over $1 billion in daily volumes. Its HyperBFT consensus
mechanism can handle a substantial amount of orders per second, and
its fully onchain order book positions it as an ‚Äúonchain Binance,‚Äù
bridging CEX efficiency with DEX transparency. With a comparative
valuation of around $5 billion and plans for further development like
an EVM-compatible layer, Hyperliquid is poised to capture significant
market share in the DeFi derivatives market. 

 UNDERSTANDING MINIMUM BLOB BASE FEES (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Blob space on Ethereum incurs a minimum fee of $0.10 to $3 per blob,

change is expected to increase the average blob cost by nearly 1% and
solve the cold start problem where they have been slow to reach the
targeted level of demand.

 THOUGHTS AROUND IBIT OPTIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This thread analyzes the approval of IBIT options in the context of
existing crypto options markets. Deribit trades $40 billion notional
monthly in BTC options compared to CME's $3B. Though a short squeeze
is unlikely, increased derivatives volumes, volatility dampening due
to structured products, and an altcoin boom could occur if crypto
lending returns. The author predicts compression of basis spreads in
Bitcoin futures vs spot and highlights the complex interplay between
traditional finance and crypto-native markets. 

 Q4 PREDICTIONS FOR AIRDROP LAND (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The EIGEN and liquid restaking tokens airdrop narratives have
primarily ended. Other restaking protocols like Symbiotic and Karak
might offer moderate-sized rewards. A good play might be to use a
restaking protocol for Babylon using Bitcoin, like Bedrock or Mezo.
There might be some potential in gaming projects, especially those
with NFTs that have been out for a few years but are already written
off as dead. Hyperliquid is expected to be great, while Scroll will
likely be disappointing.
