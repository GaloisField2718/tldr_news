 BITCOIN PLUNGES BELOW $50,000, ETHER UNDER $2,200 AMID JUMP CRYPTO
MOVES, US ELECTION UNCERTAINTY (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin hit its lowest price since February, and the rest of the
market saw greater than 20% decreases in one of the biggest selloffs
since FTX. Investors are reacting to several events, including Jump
Crypto liquidating hundreds of millions of dollars of assets, the
increasing chances of a Kamala Harris presidency, and a sharp decline
in Japan's stock market. There are also fears about an impending
recession, and ETHE investors are selling their positions in the
Grayscale trust. 

 IN FEC COMPLAINT, MOLLY WHITE ALLEGE COINBASE VIOLATED CAMPAIGN
FINANCE LAWS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Public Citizen and Molly White filed a complaint to the Federal
Elections Committee (FEC) claiming that Coinbase violated campaign
finance laws by donating $25 million to the pro-crypto group Fairshake
Super PAC while negotiating government contracts with the DOJ. The
complaint argues that Coinbase is a federal contractor due to its
current work with the US Marshal Service (a unit within the DOJ), and
is thus breaking "pay-to-play" laws.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GUIDE TO BREVIS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Brevis is an EigenLayer-secured ZK coprocessor that enables smart
contracts to read historic onchain data. It allows dapps to introduce
features like intent-based active liquidity management, loyalty
trading programs, and account reputation. Its decentralized prover
network and Brevis coChain allow for efficient and trust-minimized
ZK-proof validation. 

 SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING ROLLUP DESIGNS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This thread highlights some of the most innovative rollups with
technological and cultural differentiations from Ethereum. It includes
a chain for halal finance, one with an MEV-free crosschain DEX, and
another with EVM and SVM apps running in parallel. There are also L2s
requiring all users to KYC and designed for banks.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 CROSS-L2 ROADMAP IN ONE TWEET (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cross-L2 interoperability problems require considerable effort, but
we should quickly achieve a seamless UX across Ethereum-based rollups.
Work is being done on chain-specific addresses, cross-L2 sends using
liquidity providers, L2 light clients, and replayable account state
updates. In Phase 2 of the roadmap, shared key management and proof
aggregation will further improve the experience. 

 HOW BITCOIN HAS VALUE WITHOUT CASH FLOWS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Bitcoin's service is the trustless storage of wealth without relying
on a centralized intermediary. Like a company offering a service, if
more people want BTC's service and buy the asset, the price increases,
and vice versa. There is no centralized entity to collect this value -
it accrues to prior BTC holders.

 EVALUATING THE CAUSES OF CRYPTO PANIC (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Friday saw terrible macro signals, including the 10-year Treasury
rate falling 40bps and poor equity performance, but there will likely
be a rate cut in September, and it is still an election year. Jump
Crypto sold hundreds of millions of ETH in a short period,
contributing to the rapid price decline, and the negative ETF flows
are hurting the market in the short term but necessary for new capital
flows in the long term. Though a democratic election is perceived to
hurt crypto, the Middle East tensions may not matter in the long term,
and the Mt Gox and Genesis distributions are nearly complete. 

 COULD A CRYPTO APP BE THE ANSWER FOR STRUGGLING RESTAURANTS? (10
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Blackbird aims to recharge the restaurant industry by integrating a
crypto-based reward system ($FLY) that rewards users for dining
check-ins, creating an interconnected, circular economy among
participating restaurants. Although the app has been praised for its
simple, consumer focused UX, many restaurant operators are hesitant
about the crypto aspect, preferring traditional loyalty methods. Most
restaurants do not currently accept $FLY, which could limit the app's
impact. However, restaurant operators frequently praise the app's
ability to help them better understand and reward customer loyalty.
