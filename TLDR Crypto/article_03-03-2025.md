 WELCOMING A NEW ETHEREUM FOUNDATION LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE (1 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The Ethereum Foundation is introducing a new leadership structure
with Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stańczak serving as co-Executive
Directors. Both leaders have previous experience at the Ethereum
Foundation and extensive technical, research, and organizational
expertise. 

 TRUMP DIRECTS WORKING GROUP TO 'MOVE FORWARD' ON ETH, BTC, SOL, XRP,
AND ADA CRYPTO STRATEGIC RESERVE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 President Trump announced a directive for the Presidential Working
Group on Crypto to establish a “Crypto Strategic Reserve” that
will include SOL, XRP, ADA, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The federal
government already holds approximately $17 billion in Bitcoin and $120
million in ETH, with this initiative expanding on the January
executive order for a “national digital asset stockpile.” This
announcement comes days before the inaugural White House Crypto
Summit.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING FLYNET: BLACKBIRD'S ONCHAIN TRANSACTION NETWORK (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Blackbird has launched Flynet, a Layer 3 built on Coinbase's new Base
Appchain technology. The network aims to help restaurants retain more
value from commerce while building connectivity between
establishments, customers, and workers through a decentralized system.
Flynet offers a flat 2% transaction fee, greater control over customer
data, seamless payment experiences through the Blackbird app, and new
loyalty program opportunities. The network's token, F2, will be
distributed to existing Blackbird users who have earned FLY rewards.
Flynet currently boasts over 10,000 daily transactions and more than
107,000 wallets holding FLY. 

 DEEP DIVE INTO FLASHBLOCKS ON BASE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Base has launched Flashblocks, which achieves 200ms transaction
speeds 10x faster than current EVM chains and surpasses Solana's 400ms
through "mini-blocks" that enable near-instant confirmations while
maintaining Ethereum's security. The innovation separates sequencing,
proving, and posting processes, unlocking faster DEX trades, seamless
on-chain gaming, and reduced front-running, all with lower fees.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 A COMPLETE BEGINNERS GUIDE TO WEB3 AND CRYPTO STACK (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 There are twelve primary components forming the foundation of
decentralized technologies. L1 chains like Ethereum provide the
security backbone, supplemented by L2 solutions that address
scalability challenges. More specialized infrastructure like identity
protocols, smart contract programming languages, development tools,
frontend frameworks, decentralized storage solutions, node providers,
restaking protocols, social networks, and DeFi applications work in
concert to create a more open internet where users maintain control of
their digital assets and interactions. 

 DESCI: A REVOLUTION? OR JUST A DREAM? (42 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This author, a recent Ph.D graduate, examines whether Decentralized
Science (DeSci) can repair academia's broken systems. Traditional
science struggles with inefficient funding processes, exploitative
journal publishing models, and siloed research practices that hinder
collaboration. While blockchain offers promising solutions through
transparency, ownership, verification, and token incentives, DeSci's
impact will likely be complementary rather than revolutionary. It
shows strength in funding small-scale commercial projects, improving
peer review processes, and enabling better collaboration between
researchers.

 ETHDENVER BREAKDOWN (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ETHDenver 2024 demonstrated the convergence of AI, crypto, and
traditional finance, emphasizing Bitcoin's rise and blockchains as
“keepers of truth” in an AI era. Discussions highlighted
blockchain's critical role as a “keeper of truth” in an
AI-dominated future, critiques of outdated conference formats, and
calls for AI-integrated blockchains to democratize app creation. 

 SOLANA INFLATION REDUCTION SIMD-0228 (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A critic has raised concerns about the Solana SIMD-0228 proposal,
which aims to adjust inflation through a dynamic staking-based
emission model, arguing it overlooks risks such as validator
centralization and insufficient security analysis. They contest
proponents' claims—including assertions that high staking yields
harm DeFi, reduce ETF demand, or weaken price performance—by
highlighting flawed comparisons (e.g., ETH ETF dynamics) and
emphasizing the need to prioritize global tax neutrality and validator
sustainability.
