FOR CRYPTO: COINBASE (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Coinbase's recent weekly report suggests the U.S. economy may have

investing in crypto or stocks. The report talks about key recession
indicators like a rising unemployment rate and an inverted Treasury
yield curve amidst expectations of a September Fed rate cut.

 Kevin Owocki, founder of Gitcoin, has a new book that explains
capital allocation and how it can be revolutionized using crypto and
blockchain. It dives into mechanisms for funding and coordination,
including quadratic rounds and retroactive grants, and explains the

 WITH INTENTS, IT'S SOLVERS ALL THE WAY DOWN (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article discusses the challenges and potential solutions related
to intent-based protocols in decentralized finance, particularly the
need for more solvers to execute user intents efficiently. It
highlights the current barriers to entry for solvers, such as staking
requirements and high operational costs, and explores emerging
solutions like ERC-7683 for standardizing intents and platforms like
Khalani for solver collaboration to address these issues and avoid
centralization.

 HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE ETHEREUM ECOSYSTEM (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vitalik Buterin's EthCC keynote explained Ethereum's strengths, areas
of improvement, and future vision for the ecosystem. Going forward,
the Ethereum base layer could be anything from a minimal proof
verifier for L2s to a high-performance Solana-like L1, though Buterin
sees being the L2 base layer as the focus. Ethereum's staking is
extensive and decentralized, and solo staking is further improving.
There are risks around socially recovering from 51% attacks and
preventing censorship, and L2s need to incorporate more trustless
verification via light clients and zero-knowledge proofs. 

 THE VALUE OF GOVERNANCE (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Much criticism has been put towards governance tokens that do not
accrue value or pay dividends. Uniswap's UNI has not paid dividends or
collected fees yet. However, the token has a multi-billion dollar
market cap and the protocol has a 70% DEX market share, generated $820
million in fees distributed to LPs, and has over 500k DAUs. Though
some stocks do not pay dividends and have high valuations yet still
earn revenue, some protocols do not collect any fees for their
treasury or token holders, so the value of pure governance rights and
the potential of a future fee switch is the basis for its worth.
