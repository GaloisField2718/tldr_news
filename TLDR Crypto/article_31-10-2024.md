IN DAILY INFLOWS, LARGEST SINCE JUNE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw record inflows of $870M on Tuesday, with
BlackRock's IBIT ETF leading the increase with $642M inflows and
reaching its highest trading volume since March. Spot Ethereum ETFs

 MR.BEAST LINKED TO CRYPTO WALLET SCAM (24 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers investigating MrBeast's involvement in cryptocurrency
claim that he was involved in insider trading and profited from
promoting and later selling tokens to his followers. The investigation
uncovered more than 50 wallets linked to him, showing patterns of
large token allocations, strategic selling near price peaks, and
connections with other influencers. This resulted in millions in
profits while leaving many projects' followers with significant
losses.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING MEMEPAY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Memeland (owned by 9GAG) has announced MemePay, a new payment
platform designed for "memecoin" users that allows them to use their
digital assets for real-world purchases while offering rewards like
airdrops and exclusive perks with every transaction. The service
promises simple, jargon-free information on eligibility, security, and
card options. It aims to be accessible for all types of users. 

 FAULT PROOFS ARE NOW LIVE ON BASE MAINNET (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Base has deployed fault proofs on its mainnet, enabling
permissionless state validation and marking a significant step toward
Stage 1 decentralization. The implementation allows any participant to
propose claims about the chain state and challenge potentially
fraudulent claims within 3.5 days, with successful challengers
receiving economic incentives. Base plans to achieve full stage 1
decentralization in the coming months with a decentralized security
council for protocol upgrades, with Stage 2 developments in 2025
through multiple fault proof implementations and improved state
validation standards.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 VIRTUALS PROTOCOL: SIMPLIFYING THE CRYPTO X AI EXPERIENCE (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Virtuals Protocol allows users to create and co-own AI agents across
gaming and entertainment applications without any coding. It enables
these agents to interact in virtual environments and generate revenue
through user engagement. Users can purchase tokens for governance
rights and potentially earn $VIRTUAL, the platform's currency. 

 GLOBAL CRYPTO DEVELOPER DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Electric Capital's analysis of over 110,000 crypto developer profiles
revealed that Asia leads with 32% of global crypto developers. North
America's share has declined, from 44% in 2015 to 24% in 2024. The
United States remains the top country with 18.8% of developers,
followed by India with 11.8%. Within the US, 64% developers work
outside of California and New York, highlighting crypto's potential
for nationwide economic impact.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TOKEN TERMINAL UPGRADE (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The upgraded Tokens Terminal AI agent acts as a key opinion leader by
analyzing and tweeting about top token holdings using three main
systems: Llama 405B for content creation, Flux for image generation,
and DITHER-powered token analysis. Future features will improve
functionality with automated trading, multimodal capabilities, and
increased social engagement. 

 THE FAT WALLET THESIS (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A new thesis suggests value in the blockchain stack will increasingly
accrue to wallets rather than protocols or applications, driven by
protocols' diminishing pricing power and applications' commoditization
through increased competition. Wallets are positioned to capture value
through their proximity to end users, particularly via
payment-for-order-flow and distribution as a service, leveraging high
switching costs and mobile UX dominance. However, emerging frontend
competitors like Jupiter and Infinex could challenge wallets'
dominance by offering integrated user experience combining the most
common activities with non-custodial principles.
