MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TERRA BLOCKCHAIN EXPLOIT DRAINS OVER $4M IN TOKENS, CHAIN HALTED (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Terra blockchain was halted after an exploit drained over $4
million in tokens, including 60 million ASTRO tokens, causing ASTRO's
price to plummet. The network resumed after an emergency patch, but
the exploit highlighted vulnerabilities in the inter-blockchain
communication protocol, leading to sharp declines in Terra's LUNA and
ASTRO tokens. 

 41.5% OF MT. GOX BITCOIN HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Despite the recent movement of $3 billion in Bitcoin from a Mt.
Gox-affiliated wallet, the market barely reacted, with Bitcoin prices
holding steady. Analysts believe this is because Mt. Gox creditors are
long-term holders who are unlikely to sell, and the market has already
factored in these transfers.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE BULL CASE FOR AAVE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Aave's introduction of protocol fee distributions to token stakers
could mark the bottom of its negative price movement over the past few
years. For this proposal to go through, it must pass a couple more
votes and the protocol must hit ‚Äútrigger milestones,‚Äù like the GHO
stablecoin reaching a 175 million supply. The DAO is cutting expenses
and its status as a blue-chip protocol is hard to replicate. It is one
of the few protocols that has proven PMF along with high float and a
low fully diluted valuation.

 This thread highlights 20 pieces of advice to ensure general internet
security and crypto wallet safety. Tips include using multiple emails
with different passwords, disabling SMS authentication, and revoking

 NEW RESEARCH ON DRIVERS OF CRYPTO ASSET PRICES (35 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Uniswap Labs, Circle, and the Copenhagen Business School have
released a paper explaining how traditional financial factors affect
the crypto market. Since 2019, digital asset prices have been composed
of monetary policy, broad market risk premium, and crypto-specific
demand. Two-thirds of Bitcoin's 2022 decline can be attributed to
contractionary monetary policy. 2023 and beyond's bull market has been
driven by the decrease in crypto risk. Day-to-day Bitcoin volatility
can be explained best by adoption and risk premium shocks. 

 THE RISE OF SOLANA RWAS AND STABLE COINS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Solana is rapidly emerging as a leader in stablecoins and real-world
assets (RWAs), positioning itself as a key player in merging
traditional finance with onchain economies. With robust stablecoin
growth, particularly in USDC, and innovative RWA projects like Maple
and Parcl, Solana is expanding its ecosystem to attract both retail
and institutional capital. Solana is set to further solidify its place
in the tokenization of real-world assets through initiatives like the
Libre Fund and Jupiter's GUM Alliance aimed at driving adoption and
reinforcing its position in the market.
