MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE TO OPEN CHARLOTTE OFFICE (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Coinbase is expanding to Charlotte, North Carolina. It plans to hire
over 130 employees and open a new office focused on compliance and
customer support. This move aligns with CEO Brian Armstrong's broader
push to invest in U.S. local economies and talent, which includes a
commitment to hire 1,000 domestic employees in support of pro-crypto
policies and Trump's “America First” agenda. 

 CANTOR STRIKES $3.6BN CRYPTO DEAL WITH SOFTBANK AND TETHER (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A consortium led by Cantor Equity Partners will merge into Twenty One
Capital, a $3.6 billion Bitcoin acquisition vehicle launching with
42,000 BTC, making it the third largest corporate reserve. The deal
includes a $385 million convertible bond and $200 million private
equity placement. Tether will contribute at least $1.5 billion in
Bitcoin, with SoftBank and Bitfinex providing the remainder. Modeled
on MicroStrategy's pivot to large-scale crypto holdings, Twenty One
Capital aims to harness institutional demand under a more
accommodating Trump administration. Strike founder Jack Mallers will
act as CEO.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PECTRA MAINNET ANNOUNCEMENT (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Pectra upgrade will activate on Ethereum mainnet on May 7,
bringing major enhancements across accounts, validation, and data
throughput. EIP-7702 enables hybrid “smart accounts” for EOAs that
support batching, gas sponsorship, alternative auth, spending limits,
and recoveries. EIPs 7251, 7002, and 6110 let validators compound
rewards up to 2,048 ETH, trigger withdrawals via execution-layer
credentials, and cut deposit queue delays from ~9 hours to ~13
minutes. EIP-7691 doubles blob capacity to slash L2 calldata costs,
and EIP-7623 caps block size to manage bandwidth. 

 INTRODUCING THE BOUNDLESS PROTOCOL (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Boundless Protocol, built by the RISC Zero team, is a decentralized
marketplace that treats ZK-powered verifiable compute as a tradeable
commodity across all blockchains, matching provers and requestors via
auctions in a spot market. It introduces Proof of Verifiable Work, a
primitive that meters and rewards proof generation and financializes
compute through a tokenized market with price discovery, hedging, and
a native ZKC token rewarding provers based on cycles proven. Deploys
on each chain inherit that chain's security and liveness, while
Boundless nodes provide horizontal scaling by aggregating abundant
compute resources.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW CRYPTO PROJECTS FOLLOW A 2,200-YEAR-OLD SCRIPT (12 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Crypto governance repeatedly cycles through historical political
models. They start with founder “monarchy,” move through cults of
personality, core-dev “aristocracy,” token-whale “oligarchy”,
DAO “democracy,” mob-rule “ochlocracy,” and back to emergency
centralization. Each phrase concentrates or disperses power until
inefficiencies or self-interest triggers the next revolution. Pure
decentralization leads to governance paralysis or mob rule, while
centralization restores order at the cost of censorship resistance. 

 TO COIN OR NOT TO COIN (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Zora's new “content coins” let creators attach tradable tokens to
individual posts (like photos or videos), offering a new way to earn
money directly based on attention. Supporters say it's a fun,
low-stakes way to reward creators and surface great content, but
critics worry it turns everything into a money game, makes content
feel cheap, and could overwhelm users with too many tokens.

 TOKENIZATION AS A SAAS LIQUIDITY OPTION (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Tokenized assets like BlackRock's $2B BUIDL Treasury fund, which
offer daily interest, instant settlement, and easy collateral use,
show how blockchain can make investing faster and more efficient. As
tokenization expands to stocks, they could revolutionize capital
markets by lowering IPO costs, increasing global investor access, and
replacing slow legacy systems with real-time, decentralized
infrastructure. 

 VITALIK AND BALAJI PREDICTIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vitalik Buterin and Balaji Srinivasan have complementary visions of
crypto's trajectory. Buterin sees Ethereum as a hub for public-goods
coordination and programmable equality, while Srinivasan frames it as
a sovereignty-first, opt-out framework. They agree that DeFi must
prove itself through real-world crises, stablecoins have become core
financial infrastructure, and DeSci could reinvent medical research
incentives. AI prompting is here to stay as a new programming
paradigm. AGI will be judged by its ability to build viable
businesses. Fiat's dominance will erode once money lives onchain.
