 ETHEREUM RESEARCHER PROPOSES 100-FOLD 'EXPONENTIAL' GAS LIMIT BOOST
TO IMPROVE MAINNET SCALING (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist has proposed EIP-9698, a plan to
increase the network's gas limit by 100x over four years, potentially
enabling up to 2,000 transactions per second. While it could greatly
improve scalability and competitiveness, it may strain less-optimized
nodes and slow block propagation, requiring gradual adaptation. 

 NEXO TO REENTER US MARKET AFTER TWO-YEAR REGULATORY EXIT AND $45
MILLION SETTLEMENT (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nexo is reentering the U.S. market nearly two years after exiting due
to regulatory scrutiny, having paid a $45M settlement without
admitting wrongdoing. Announced at a private event attended by Donald
Trump Jr., Nexo's return aligns with the Trump administration's more
crypto-friendly regulatory stance and includes plans to relaunch
savings accounts, asset-backed loans, and other core services.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE TO LAUNCH YIELD-BEARING BITCOIN FUND FOR INSTITUTIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Coinbase Asset Management will launch the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund
on May 1, targeting a net annual return of 4%-8% for institutional
investors outside the U.S. It will implement a cash-and-carry
strategy, arbitraging between spot and derivatives markets, to
generate yield on Bitcoin holdings. The fund is backed by investors
like Abu Dhabi's Aspen Digital and aims to reduce operational and
investment risks associated with Bitcoin yield products. 

 NOISE: TURNING ATTENTION INTO A MARKET (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Noise is a new trading app that lets users long or short a project's
mindshare. Tracked via Kaito's onchain oracle monitoring Crypto
Twitter activity, its leaderboard-driven UX fosters a viral
trading-tweeting loop, offering potential stickiness beyond memecoin
speculation and challenging the “tokenize everything” narrative.
Long-term success will depend on maintaining liquid markets and
preventing attention manipulation.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO BRING AIRDROPS HOME (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Airdrops, which distribute tokens widely to users, are a powerful
tool for building communities, decentralizing networks, and solving
early growth challenges, but they're often misunderstood in the crypto
world. This post unpacks the role of airdrops, the risks like Sybil
attacks, and proposals for making airdrops legally safer in the U.S.
It also dives into why stablecoins are becoming a backbone of global
payments, outlines principles for securely custodying crypto assets,
and highlights news like PayPal's PYUSD rewards and Helium's
partnership with AT&T. 

 THE ULTIMATE STARTING POINT FOR GOING DOWN THE DEAI RABBIT HOLE (35
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The influx of new talent during last year's agent boom is now
crystallizing around pre- and post-training infrastructure,
open-source research, and onchain incentive design. Crypto x AI is
emerging across four pillars: AI fundamentals, open-source
collaboration, DeAI protocols, and historical precedents.
Decentralized pre-training, distributed fine-tuning (“RL Gyms”),
and modular post-training markets could unlock new value flows.
Drawing on lessons from ‘90s open-source movements and emerging
GPU-network research, DeAI's growth will follow philosophical,
practical, and experimental paths.

 PUMP.FUN COMPETITION IS OVERSTATED (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Despite new competitors, Pump overwhelmingly dominates on launchpad
fees, earning over $1.36M in 24 hours and vastly outpacing others like
SunPump ($328) and Moonshot (~2% of Pump's fees). Given Pump's $700M
revenue and strong industrial backing, its market leadership remains
secure unless a competitor shows meaningful traction. 

 TOKENIZATION AS A SAAS LIQUIDITY OPTION (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 BlackRock's BUIDL tokenized Treasury fund has rapidly grown to $2
billion, bringing with it near-instant settlement and onchain
collateral borrowing. CEO Larry Fink believes fully tokenizing every
asset could eliminate market closures, free up billions now tied in
settlement delays, and accelerate economic growth. While Treasuries
lead the way, tokenized equities stand ready to follow once regulatory
frameworks adapt, promising global trading access, shareholder voting
via tokens, and dramatically reduced IPO costs.
