INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 KRAKEN ANNOUNCES INK: AN OP SUPERCHAIN L2 (2 MINUTE READ) [6]

for Ink, an Ethereum L2 built using Optimism's OP Stack technology.
Set to launch in early 2025, with a testnet going live in 17 days, Ink

using Optimism's technology. The OP Stack now powers 43 rollups with

READ) [7]

enable users to encrypt health data onchain and monetize access to it.
The health data market is expected to reach $540 billion in the next
10 years, with established players like Whoop and Oura not offering
users monetization of their data. Pulse plans to support an ecosystem
of apps leveraging user health data. It will initially release 10,000
genesis devices.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE VERTICAL INTEGRATORS: ETHENA, HYPERLIQUID, AND UNISWAP (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Major DeFi protocols like Ethena, Hyperliquid, and Uniswap are
launching general-purpose chains and L2s focused on their strengths.
Ethena uses USDe for capital efficiency, Uniswap capitalizes on its
DEX dominance and MEV capture, and Hyperliquid utilizes its
derivatives trading ecosystem. Vertical integration suggests that
apps, not chains, control user relationships, potentially threatening
traditional general-purpose without clear differentiation. App-centric
chains may be better positioned to capture more value from their
existing user bases than undifferentiated L1s. 

 DEMYSTIFYING THE CRYPTO X AI STACK (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post outlines a vision for the convergence of crypto and AI
centered on the emergence of an “Agentic Web” where AI agents
operate with crypto rails and become the primary drivers of economic
activity. There are two core segments – decentralized AI that brings
crypto to AI infra and onchain AI that uses AI to enhance crypto apps
– and four layers: compute, data, middleware, and applications.
Crypto is predicted to become the preferred payment rail for
agent-to-agent commerce.
