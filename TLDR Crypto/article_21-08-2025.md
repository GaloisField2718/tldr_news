MARKETS & BUSINESS

 ETH/BTC RATIO HITS 2025 HIGH AS ETFS AND TREASURIES SOAK SUPPLY (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ethereum has increased 70% since June 1 versus bitcoin's 9%, lifting
the ETH/BTC ratio above 0.037 to a new yearly high. The rally largely
stems from ~$9.4B of U.S. spot ETH ETF inflows and digital asset
treasuries now holding over 2% of ETH supply, up from 0.2% two months
ago. Together, ETFs and treasuries have absorbed 3.7% of circulating
ETH, while leveraged demand via VolatilityShares' 2x Ether ETF has
added 456,000 ETH-equivalent exposure. 

 BINANCE, COINBASE JOIN TRM LABS TO COMBAT CRYPTO CRIME (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, PayPal, Ripple, and others are among the
first to join TRM Labs' Beacon Network, a real-time intelligence
system built with law enforcement to fight crypto crime. The network
provides suspicious address flagging, real-time alerts, and rapid
response tools to freeze illicit assets before cashouts, with
participation free and opt-in for verified members. TRM Labs estimates
at least $47B in crypto has been sent to fraud-linked addresses since
2023, with the Beacon initiative targeting threats from ransomware,
North Korean hackers, and terrorist financiers.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 YE (KANYE WEST) RELEASES COIN (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After months of speculation, Ye (formerly Kanye West) has released
YZY coin on Solana. It is a “concept for a new financial system”
that includes Ye Pay (crypto payments processor) and YZY Card (debit
card for spending YZY). Ye Pay is already available on Ye's main
website for use. The coin spiked to over $3 billion market cap shortly
after launch before falling to $1.5 billion. 

 INTRODUCING ZKC COIN FROM BOUNDLESS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Boundless's ZK Coin (ZKC) is the native token of its universal ZK
proving protocol. It enables any blockchain to access zero-knowledge
computation through independent prover nodes without requiring
infrastructure changes. The ZK proving protocol introduces Proof of
Verifiable Work (PoVW), a novel consensus mechanism where provers
stake ZKC as collateral (typically 10x the request fee) and earn
rewards by generating unique ZK proofs, with slashing penalties for
failed deliveries. ZKC has an initial supply of 1 billion tokens with
7% inflation in Year 1, tapering to 3% by Year 8, and the effective
circulating supply decreases as more proofs require collateral
staking. The system creates a scaling loop where increased proof
demand leads to more ZKC locked as collateral, positioning ZK Coin as
the foundational economic layer for ZK proving across the entire
blockchain ecosystem.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 COINBASE BETS ON AI PAYMENTS FUELED BY DIGITAL DOLLARS (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Coinbase is positioning itself as infrastructure for the emerging AI
economy with x402, an open-source payments protocol that enables apps,
bots, and autonomous systems to charge and settle payments instantly
using stablecoins. This strategic pivot represents a deliberate shift
away from speculative trading toward building practical payment rails
for AI agents that need to make micro-transactions for computing costs
or services. Coinbase is betting that stablecoins will become the
default payment method for AI commerce, offering advantages like
instant settlement, programmability, and freedom from traditional
banking restrictions. 

 AN INTRO TO HYPERGAMBLIFIED MARKET DESIGN (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Successful crypto gaming requires "hypergamblification" –
integrating speculative mechanics directly into gameplay rather than
treating games as labor-based extraction systems like Play-to-Earn
models did. Play-to-Earn collapsed because it removed the fun and
speculation that makes games sticky, turning players into extractors
rather than participants in risk-based entertainment. Onchain
infrastructure makes speculation-based gaming inevitable by providing
instant liquidity, composable markets, transparent odds, and
programmable settlement that can turn any game into a micro-market.
Platforms like Multiplier are building this vision through gamified
capital markets that route attention directly into market demand,
representing a shift toward "an arcade wired into a financial system"
where speculation and entertainment are inseparably fused.

 MOONWELL AND MAMO TACKLE BUGS WHILE PRESERVING USER FUNDS (3 MINUTE
READ) [11]

highlighting the team's commitment to security and efficiency. 

 WILL THE FOUR-YEAR CRYPTO CYCLE HOLD OR BREAK IN 2026? (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 On one hand, BTC's historic four-year peaks could repeat as a
self-fulfilling pattern reinforced by leverage and halving psychology.
On the other, today's cycle is shaped by institutions, ETFs,
stablecoin growth, and Fed dynamics, which may smooth volatility and
extend the rally into 2026. Missing euphoric signals and ongoing DAT
leverage risks leave the timing uncertain, but stablecoin supply
growth remains the key indicator of whether this market still has
fuel.
