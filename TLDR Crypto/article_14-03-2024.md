 ETHEREUM FINALIZES 'DENCUN' UPGRADE, IN LANDMARK MOVE TO REDUCE DATA
FEES (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Ethereum has activated the Dencun upgrade, which is expected to
catalyze growth on L2 networks like Arbitrum and Polygon by reducing
fees. The hard fork accomplished this through "proto-danksharding",
adding a new place for data storage on the blockchain at a lower cost.
The upgrade is expected to make transaction settlements more efficient
and cheaper for rollup networks, which will in turn bring down fees
for end users.

 WHAT ABOUT A PATH FORWARD FOR CONSUMER CRYPTO? (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Consumer crypto's future appears to be on two trajectories: treating
crypto as the 'why' and the 'how.' The former category includes assets
like Bitcoin and is aimed at early crypto adopters, while the latter
uses crypto as a technological instrument, appealing to mainstream
users. A new wave of innovation aims to offer unique experiences that
can only be developed with crypto, leveraging global payment rails,
