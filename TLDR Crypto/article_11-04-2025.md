MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TARIFFS, TRADE TENSIONS MAY BE POSITIVE FOR BITCOIN ADOPTION (1
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Tariffs may lead to stagflation, reducing the appeal of traditional
assets and boosting demand for inflation-resistant stores of value
like Bitcoin. As economic pressures mount and the U.S. dollar's
reserve dominance potentially wanes, Bitcoin adoption is expected to
grow, especially if policy shifts support alternative hedging
strategies. 

 US SENATE VOTES TO CONFIRM PAUL ATKINS TO LEAD THE SEC (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The Senate confirmed Paul Atkins as the SEC chair by a 52-44 vote,
marking a promising step toward a crypto-friendly regulatory
environment. His appointment, which follows a series of policy shifts
and the formation of the crypto task force, is expected to streamline
plans for oversight of the crypto market. Despite bipartisan support,
some Democrats remain cautious due to his past ties to entities
associated with FTX.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 EXPLORING NOUS' PSYCHE TRAINING NETWORK (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nous is pioneering a decentralized approach to AI model development
by combining innovations like its DisTrO training optimizer with
blockchain for coordination. It overcomes conventional bandwidth
limitations to enable distributed GPU networks to collaboratively
train sophisticated models. The network facilitates permissionless
participation and rewards contributors with token incentives. 

 JUPITER MOBILE LAUNCHES PORTFOLIO V2 (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Jupiter Mobile has launched Portfolio V2, enabling Solana users to
track millions of tokens and thousands of dApps, often revealing
hidden or forgotten assets. The release involved significant backend
work and marked the start of a broader Mobile V2 rollout focused on

experience in crypto.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 A BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING A BEAR MARKET (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Instead of obsessing over prices (or losses) during a bear market,
individuals should focus on building skills, forming strong
communities, and accumulating quality crypto through strategies like
LP-based DCA. 

 HOW USDT MINTS AND BURNS MOVE WITH BITCOIN PRICE CYCLES (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 USDT minting patterns have repeatedly aligned with Bitcoin's price
cycles, with large issuances occurring during or just before bull runs
and burning following market corrections. For example, minting events
in late 2024 coincided with Bitcoin's rapid increase to above
$100,000, while subsequent burns confirmed downward price movements.
Although some mints occasionally signal upcoming rallies, burns
validate in-progress market corrections.

 ARBITRUMDAO'S FUTURE (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ArbitrumDAO, now over two years old, is evolving beyond its
early-stage processes and will implement a new operational model to
unlock its full potential. As the Arbitrum Foundation has multiple
dedicated teams and contributors in place, it plans to take a more
active role in governance and execution to drive the DAO's long-term
success. 

 NETWORKS IN CRYPTO VC (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto VC is dominated by extreme power laws, where a small number of
funds consistently drive successful follow-on rounds and co-invest
with preferred partners. By analyzing co-investment networks and
follow-on probabilities, founders can better target high-performing
VCs, understand the dynamics of capital aggregation, and improve their
odds of raising future rounds. Strong GP relationships, not just fund
names, are key to navigating this increasingly consolidated ecosystem.
