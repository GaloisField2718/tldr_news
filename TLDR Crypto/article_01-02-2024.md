 FTX EXPECTS TO REPAY CRYPTO CUSTOMERS IN FULL (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The estate of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX announced that it believes
it can fully repay customers whose funds were caught up in the
implosion of the exchange in 2022. This repayment option emerged as
the best path forward after plans to relaunch the platform were
abandoned due to a lack of interested buyers. The news brings hope to
thousands of investors who filed claims, with the total reportedly
reaching $16 billion. 

 JUP TOKEN SOARS AFTER MASSIVE $700M JUPITER AIRDROP TO SOLANA WALLETS
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Jupiter successfully distributed about $700m of its JUP token to
nearly a million wallets in one of the largest token airdrops in
recent history. The JUP token quickly shot up to $0.72 after launching
at $0.41. Despite a heavy load on the chain, Solana's network remained
stable, defying the expectations of some skeptics. Some users
experienced difficulties in the early stages of the airdrop due to
overwhelmed RPC nodes.

that offers parallelization and formal verification. Using Block-STM

speed and enables a variety of Move and Ethereum EVM smart contracts.

 Ethereum's biggest upgrade since 2023, Dencun, which will roll out
proto-danksharding, is closer to becoming a reality after successfully
going live on the second of three test network phases. The upgrade is
expected to reduce transaction costs for L2s and make data
availability cheaper. Dencun is scheduled to go live on its final
testnet on February 7, after which a date for the main blockchain
activation will be decided upon.

 BERACHAIN VALUE FLOWS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Berachain might be a best-case scenario for users due to its unique
value flow mechanism. Unlike traditional PoS chains, Berachain's
design offers economic rewards for liquidity providers through trading
fees and BGT rewards. Delegation of BGT to a validator can lead to
earning block rewards and validator bribes. The design is ultimately
aimed at ensuring most profits from validators and protocols are
returned to its user base. 

 THE MIDCURVE AIRDROP FALLACY (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This thread discusses the pros and cons of airdrop farming. While
some crypto users complain about airdrop distributions being flawed
and diluted, others are making significant returns by farming these
drops. The author advocates for airdrop farming, which encourages
people to try out apps, suggesting that it might continue to be
lucrative and help users come up with better solutions or designs for
allocating tokens.

 REFLECTIONS FROM VITALIK (25 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In this post, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, reflects on
the fast-paced evolution of the crypto space, the shift of his role
from wunderkind to a different position, and the necessity of new
generations taking the lead. He discusses the need for the crypto
community to remind people of the relevance of money and finance and
to build a broader, alternative tech stack. Buterin highlights the
symbiotic relationship between token holders, intellectuals, builders,
and users in the crypto ecosystem. He also explores the global aspect
of crypto, referencing experiences in places like China, Silicon
Valley, Taiwan, and Argentina. 

 WORLDCOIN UNDER INVESTIGATION IN HONG KONG OVER DATA PRIVACY CONCERNS
(2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Hong Kong's privacy watchdog, PCPD, has launched an investigation

risks to personal data privacy. The probe will ascertain if Worldcoin
has breached the Personal Data Privacy Ordinance. PCPD advises the
public to consider the legitimacy and purpose of data collection
before handing over biometric data. Worldcoin, whose token value
recently dropped by more than 10%, rewards people with tokens in
return for iris scans to prove their identity.
