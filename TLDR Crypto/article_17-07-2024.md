 LI.FI HIT BY $8M EXPLOIT (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The LI.FI bridge has been hacked for at least $8M. This has resulted
in unauthorized withdrawals of up to $5.8M in ether and various
stablecoins. LI.FI has advised users against interacting with its
dapps while the issue is investigated. Users who did not set infinite
approval should not be at risk.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING CHAIN GDP (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Chain GDP is a new on-chain metric designed to accurately gauge
economic activity on a blockchain that focuses on the sum of all
application fees generated within a chain. It is difficult to
manipulate this metric (e.g., wash trading) because it only accounts
for fees paid across various applications. Chain GDP aims to provide a
clearer and more tamper-resistant picture of a blockchain's economic
activity compared to traditional metrics like TVL or transaction
count. 

 UNISWAP LAUNCHES WALLET WEB BROWSER EXTENSION (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Uniswap has officially released its wallet browser extension. The
extension is positioned directly in the browser sidebar, eliminating
pop-ups and providing seamless access to crypto transactions.
Uniswap's extension also offers automatic network switching and
supports multiple blockchains, integrating smoothly with other Uniswap
products.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 TOKEN LAUNCHES ARE REKT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE (2 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Recent token launches have been criticized for dumping upon release
and having unfair VC supply unlocks. The goal should be to reward
organic, long-term users, which could be done by extending investor
periods to align for long-term belief in a project or compressing
vesting periods to incentivize price discovery as fast as possible.
Compound VC is accepting proposals for new token designs and
distributions to be highlighted at an Ideathon. 

 CRYPTO ADOPTION HIGHLIGHTS IN 10 CHARTS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The number of crypto owners worldwide is 400-500 million, over half
of which come from Asia. The top 20 L1 chains boast 75 million monthly
active users, and L2s have 20 million MAUs. 44% of non-owners cite
instability and lack of government protection as reasons they will
never buy crypto. The most popular cryptos in the US are Bitcoin,
Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Cardano.

 THE NEXT WAVE OF CONSUMER APPS REQUIRE BETTER ONBOARDING (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This post describes an experiment that evaluated the crypto onramp
experience for new users using Phantom Wallet. The experiment
demonstrated significant challenges in the fiat-to-crypto conversion
process. None of the available payment providers supported credit card
transactions, potentially because of concerns around fraud and
chargebacks, posing a large obstacle for retail onboarding. There is a
need for more streamlined and integrated onramping processes to
increase crypto user adoption. 

 ETHEREUM AS THE FUTURE OF TOKENIZATION (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This bull cycle, Ethereum may be the only tokenization platform with
a spot ETF classified as a commodity, giving it a massive advantage in
onboarding institutions like BlackRock's BUIDL fund. It is also the
chain of choice for Coinbase, as evidenced by the Base L2.
Institutions will pay premium transaction fees for its stability and
liveness, and they will value its high cash flow and real yield.
