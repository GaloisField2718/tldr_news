through spot Bitcoin ETFs exceeding current year's $33.6 billion
inflows, projects Coinbase to enter the S&P 500 with a share price of
$700, and predicts the stablecoin market will double to $400 billion,

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 HYPERBOLIC: CULTIVATING THE OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE AI ECOSYSTEM (10
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hyperbolic has developed a GPU marketplace and inference services
platform, partnering with major organizations like Quora, Hugging
Face, and leading universities to provide verifiable, high-performance
AI infrastructure. It envisions creating an “AI Rainforest” where
resources are shared symbiotically, focusing on making AI compute more
accessible while implementing novel verification protocols like Proof
of Sampling. 

 COSMOS IS EXPANDING: SKIP JOINS THE INTERCHAIN FOUNDATION (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The Interchain Foundation (ICF) has acquired Skip, now renamed
Interchain Inc., as its main subsidiary, transitioning to centralized
development. With 115+ mainnets and $1B in monthly IBC volume, ICF
aims to 100x ecosystem liquidity via initiatives like enhancing user
experience, onboarding liquidity, and unlocking staked assets, amid
leadership changes including Ethan Buchman's exit.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AI AGENT TAKEAWAYS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI agents, now valued at over $10 billion in market cap, go beyond
tokens and tweets by integrating advanced decision-making capabilities
that allow them to execute actions both on-chain (like deploying
tokens) and off-chain (such as posting on social media). With
frameworks like ai16z's Eliza enabling memory management and
autonomous decision-making, these agents might redefine how we
interact with technology and the internet. 

 2025 TO BE THE YEAR OF DEPIN CHAIN WARS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The 2025 "DePIN Chain Wars" will see emerging blockchain ecosystems
like Base challenge Solana's dominance in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN). With strong UX, liquidity, and
Coinbase's backing, Base is attracting projects like DIMO and
positioning itself as a major player in this rapidly growing sector.

 LEANING INTO THE DLP MARKET CAP MOMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vana, a platform for DataDAOs (Data Liquidity Providers), aims to
create marketplaces where users can monetize their personal data
through secure sharing mechanisms. While the platform emphasizes data
sovereignty, widespread adoption will likely be driven by market
capitalization momentum, similar to the recent success of AI agent
tokens, rather than ideological appeals to data ownership. The
ecosystem, exemplified by projects like r/datadao, which allows Reddit
users to monetize their content data, is positioned to potentially
experience growth through token incentives and improved user
experience, with key metrics focusing on the number of new DataDAOs,
user onboarding rates, and total market capitalization. 

 SHARED PRIVATE STATE: THE HTTPS MOMENT FOR BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
(PART 1) (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Shared private state is a new architecture that allows for encrypted
yet verifiable data handling while maintaining decentralization. It is
powered by programmable cryptography advances, including Fully
Homomorphic Encryption and Multi-Party Computation, which allow for
computation on encrypted data while preserving privacy. The innovation
addresses blockchain's current public-by-default limitation,
potentially enabling new forms of secure collaboration and expanding
the scope of decentralized applications by allowing sensitive data to
be processed on-chain without exposure.
