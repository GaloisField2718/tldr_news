MARKETS & BUSINESS

 HOUSE ADVANCES GENIUS AND CLARITY CRYPTO BILLS AFTER POLITICAL
STANDOFF (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The U.S. House voted 215–211 to advance the GENIUS Act (a
stablecoin regulatory framework already passed by the Senate),
potentially sending it to President Trump by week's end. Lawmakers
also moved forward on the broader Clarity bill, which defines
regulatory roles for the SEC and CFTC, and a third bill to block the
Fed from issuing a retail CBDC. 

 JPMORGAN CHASE WILL GET INVOLVED IN STABLECOINS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 JPMorgan Chase will develop both its JPMorgan deposit coin and
broader stablecoin offerings to stay competitive with fintech rivals,
even though CEO Jamie Dimon questions their appeal compared to
traditional payment methods. The bank's limited deposit token for
clients is set to expand into universally accepted stablecoins as
regulatory clarity improves. Peer institutions like Citigroup and Bank
of America are similarly exploring bank-issued stablecoins to
modernize payment rails and defend against nonbank challengers.
Faster, cheaper settlement compared to legacy systems like ACH and
SWIFT underpins this strategic shift.

 WHY CRYPTO MATTERS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post outlines 20+ reasons why crypto is transformative, from
unlocking borderless, immutable money to enabling human verification,
digital ownership, and censorship-resistant cultural preservation.
Crypto powers reputation-based gig economies, reduces gatekeeping in
finance, and merges privacy with auditability. At its core, crypto
creates open systems for experimentation, coordination, and truth,
while also funding cryptography and offering flexible,
builder-friendly environments. 

 THE FINAL META (40 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most long-term crypto participants eventually internalize the
market's “zeitgeist,” knowing when to ride consensus narratives
and when to plant early contrarian flags. Crypto's cycles swing
between orderly narrative-driven building and chaotic degenerate
speculation, a pendulum that gradually distills deeper truths. This
iterative refinement leads to “speculative maturity,” where
collective taste shifts toward tokens backed by tangible revenue
mechanisms. In this “final meta,” revenue-oriented tokens with
buybacks or distribution flywheels become the sustainable foundation
for onchain value.

 CITI CEO OUTLINES STABLECOIN AND TOKENIZED DEPOSIT STRATEGY (1 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser revealed the bank is exploring stablecoin
issuance, reserve management, tokenized deposits, and crypto-fiat
ramps. Through Citi Token Services, clients will be able to move
assets instantly across hubs like NY, London, and HK without incurring
fiat-to-digital conversion costs. Fraser emphasized that the GENIUS
Act would level the regulatory playing field for banks to offer
real-time, cross-border, multi-bank digital asset solutions with
compliance and financing built in. 

 GRAYSCALE CONFIDENTIALLY FILES DRAFT IPO PAPERWORK (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Grayscale has confidentially filed a draft IPO registration with the
SEC, positioning itself as the next major U.S. crypto listing
following Circle's high-profile debut. The timing remains flexible,
but the move taps into renewed Wall Street appetite for digital-asset
firms under a pro-crypto administration. Coming off landmark
conversions of its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts into spot
ETFs—pushing its AUM past $30 billion—Grayscale will use
confidentiality rules to withhold financial details until shortly
before launch. Its IPO could set the tone for other heavyweight crypto
names like Kraken, BitGo, and DCG considering public offerings.
