 WHY ISSUE YOUR OWN STABLECOIN WITH BRIDGE (A STRIPE COMPANY)
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Stablecoins power trillions of dollars in global money-movement,
however, the economics are concentrated: a few players keep most
yield, set fees, and control user experience—limiting choice and
revenue for builders.

With Bridge's Open Issuance [4], any business can launch their own
stablecoin in days to earn rewards on reserves and choose how to
distribute.

→ DAY-ONE ADOPTION TOOLS: use Bridge + Stripe infrastructure to
accept, store, spend, and move your stablecoin

→ OWN DESIGN CHOICES: set reserves, fees, chains, and rewards.

→ BUILT-IN LIQUIDITY: stablecoins launched on the Open Issuance are
interoperable, enabling easy conversions.

→ GET TO MARKET QUICKLY: Bridge handles liquidity, reserves, and
GENIUS readiness so you can focus on adoption.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITGO FILES FOR $2B IPO (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Crypto custody provider BitGo filed for a US IPO seeking to raise up
to $201 million at a $1.96 billion valuation, offering 11.8 million
shares priced at $15-17 on the NYSE under ticker “BTGO” with
Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as lead underwriters. The firm holds
approximately $104 billion in assets under custody across 1,550+
digital assets for institutional clients. The IPO comes shortly after
BitGo received conditional OCC approval in December to operate as a
federally chartered national trust bank, representing one of the first
major public offerings from a pure-play crypto custody provider. 

 COINBASE WITHDRAWS SUPPORT FOR SENATE CRYPTO LEGISLATION (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Coinbase said it cannot support the Senate market-structure bill
after the release of a more than 270-page text that raised unresolved
issues around tokenized equities, DeFi treatment, provisions that
would “kill rewards on stablecoins,” and the role of the SEC.
Timing pressures, 70+ filed amendments, new illicit-finance language,
and uncertainty that concerns would be addressed led Coinbase to
withdraw backing, and the Senate Banking Committee postponed the
scheduled markup while negotiators work to fix the problems.

 BVNK TO DELIVER STABLECOIN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR VISA DIRECT PILOT
PROGRAMS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 BVNK will provide stablecoin infrastructure for Visa Direct pilot
programs, enabling select business customers to pre-fund payouts in
stablecoins and to pay recipients in stablecoins (with validators
receiving their preferred stablecoin via a backend flow). This
demonstrates a deeper Visa and BVNK integration after Visa Ventures'
2025 investment and signals a push to embed tokenized dollars into
high-volume money-movement rails for faster, 24/7 global payments. 

 NOAH AND NALA LAUNCH INSTANT STABLECOIN SETTLEMENT NETWORK (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Noah and NALA partnered to create a cross-border settlement network
that converts global USD collections into stablecoins and routes
real-time local-currency payouts via Rafiki, enabling instant USD
settlement, 24/7 treasury, and rapid local distribution for businesses
across Africa and Asia. This partnership targets payroll, merchant
payouts, and treasury use cases while bypassing slow, fee-heavy legacy
rails.

 VITALIK BUTERIN PROPOSES QUANTUM-SAFE ETHEREUM FRAMEWORK (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Vitalik Buterin has published a framework that outlines seven
protocol requirements for Ethereum to achieve “ossification” - the
ability to function independently without ongoing developer
intervention. The first priority is implementing century-scale quantum
resistance to prevent future quantum computing advances from
compromising user funds and network consensus. Additional requirements
include scaling to thousands of TPS through ZK-EVM validation and
PeerDAS, implementing statelessness and state expiry, moving beyond
ECDSA to fully abstracted accounts, and establishing
censorship-resistant block-building mechanisms. Buterin proposed a
staged rollout that completes at least one requirement per year. 

 ZAMA: BUILDING HTTPS FOR BLOCKCHAINS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Crypto's biggest barrier to mainstream adoption is that everything
onchain is public by default - wallet balances, transaction history,
DeFi positions, and payroll are all visible to anyone. While early
crypto users valued this transparency, it's wildly unsafe for normal
people, businesses, banks, and governments. Zama is building what it
calls “HTTPS for blockchains” using Fully Homomorphic Encryption
(FHE) to enable confidential smart contracts, aiming to upgrade crypto
from “everything is public” to “encrypted by default” -
potentially the most important infrastructure shift since smart
contracts.

 2 NOTES FOR CRYPTO BUILDERS IN 2026 (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Excessive pivoting to trading platforms creates overcrowded markets
and sacrifices long-term defensibility. Founders should prioritize
genuine product development over speculation-driven token dynamics.
Imminent crypto market structure regulation will eliminate industry
distortions caused by legal uncertainty - such as avoiding
transparency and designing economically valueless tokens - by
replacing “enforcement roulette” with clear standards. 

 CHAOS LABS: AI AS OPERATIONAL INFRA FOR DEFI (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI is a foundational operational infrastructure that addresses DeFi's
“attention tax” – the mounting cognitive burden of synthesizing
fragmented data across 100+ chains and dozens of disjointed sources
that creates asymmetric advantages for well-resourced institutions.
General-purpose AI models fail crypto-specific analysis due to a lack
of domain training, creating an opportunity for specialized
infrastructure that operationalizes sophisticated risk assessment.
Chaos AI, trained on four years of proprietary crypto data,
democratizes institutional-grade risk intelligence by converting raw
blockchain data into actionable analysis.
