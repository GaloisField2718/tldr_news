 CHARTING HISTORY'S RHYME: UNDERSTANDING THE CYCLICALITY OF CRYPTO
MARKETS (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This analysis delves into the cyclicality of the crypto market,
focusing on Bitcoin. The current cycle, which is the sixth, has been

from the past. The current Bitcoin cycle has been relatively smooth in
comparison to previous cycles, though it's likely to see at least 10
more corrections before reaching the cycle's peak if the past is a
guide. The post also dives into some of the other factors affecting
the Bitcoin cycle and crypto cycles in general.
