 ROYCO: THE LIQUIDITY COORDINATION PROTOCOL (2 MINUTE READ) [7]

today is inexact and done through airdrops, liquidity mining, and
other un-optimized methods. Royco's Liquidity Coordinator allows
programmability and order books to create liquidity negotiation,
allowing providers to know exactly what they will get in return. Since
every position is tokenized, users can sell or exchange positions,
providing flexibility for locked assets.

 DESIGNER BLOCKSPACE: THE FUTURE OF EXECUTION ENVIRONMENTS (38 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Though the data availability cost has been alleviated through
Ethereum's blobs and special-purpose protocols like Celestia,
inefficient computation and state access remain bottlenecks. There are
multiple paths to improving execution performance, including
parallelization, state expiry or statelessness, and sharding. Each L1
and L2's decisions about these improvements will impact the design of
their execution layer, the value proposition of blockspace, and the
competitive moat of its chain. 

 SOLANA: ACCELERATED ADOPTION (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Solana's revival after the FTX collapse and bear market has
solidified its spot as the third major crypto asset behind BTC and
ETH. Its recent run began in Q3 2023, when Jito and Pyth started the
modern airdrop wave, driving the ecosystem to new highs in various
metrics, supported by an explosion in memecoins. Its network effects
and performance are expected to grow further and host the next ‚Äúbig
thing in crypto.‚Äù Though the network is congested, development is
actively solving this problem, and the Firedancer validator client by
Jump Crypto should drastically improve Solana's throughput.
