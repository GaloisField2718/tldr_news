 SOLANA UP 13% AS POSSIBILITY OF PANTERA BUYING SOME OF FTX'S SOL
LOOMS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pantera is raising funds to purchase $250 million worth of SOL from
FTX, aiming to buy at a 39% discount from the 30-day average price.
This comes following FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, which allow it to
sell up to $100 million per week in crypto assets. Pantera would need
to hold the tokens for up to four years after purchase as per the
deal's condition. 

 SEC PUSHES BACK TIMELINE ON BLACKROCK'S SPOT BITCOIN ETF OPTIONS
TRADING APPLICATION (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The SEC will delay its decision to approve or disapprove options
trading for BlackRock's bitcoin ETF until April 24, allowing for more
time to consider the proposal. It has also delayed decisions on
allowing Cboe and Miax Pearl to list and trade options on spot bitcoin
ETFs, with their deadlines set for the same date.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AM-AMM: AN AUCTION-MANAGED AUTOMATED MARKET MAKER (25 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 This paper describes a pioneering design for Automated Market Makers
called Auction-Managed AMMs. Addressing informed trader loss and
uninformed trader fee revenue optimization issues, this concept allows
players to bid to manage pools and dynamically adjust swap fees. The
design optimizes transaction fees, benefiting liquidity providers and
retail investors and potentially attracting more liquidity than
traditional AMMs, thereby enhancing efficiency on DeFi platforms. 

 BINANCE WILL LET USERS BET ON FUTURES PLATFORM TOKEN LISTINGS (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Binance has launched a new platform, Futures NEXT, that incentivizes
users to accurately predict the next tokens to be listed on its
futures exchange. Users can nominate tokens and place bets on them,
with successful predictions rewarded through vouchers for futures
trading or fee rebates. Binance ensured users that this platform will
not influence token listings and is independent of its listing
process.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 SLASHING SECURITY VS. TOKEN TOXICITY SECURITY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post compares the concept of Token Toxicity, where stakers don't
attack a protocol in fear of depreciating their staked tokens, to
Slashing security. Slashing offers stronger security as it
individually penalizes malicious actors, resulting in a higher cost of
corruption. Protocols stand to gain more from adopting Slashing than
relying solely on Token Toxicity. 

 WHAT IS HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY AND WHY IS EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT IT?
(3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread explores the increasing trend toward horizontal
blockchain scalability. This method, unlike vertical scaling,
distributes workloads across numerous nodes, allowing networks to
expand by adding more machines. Vertical scaling, on the other hand,
improves a single machine's abilities. Both methods have their merits,
but horizontal scaling ultimately ensures global scalability and is
hailed as the future of blockchain systems.

 2024/2025 TOP SIGNALS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Traditional indicators for cryptocurrency market tops might not be
relevant in the current cycle. The increasing influence of
institutions like BlackRock on Bitcoin sentiment and the mainstream
adoption of crypto could change what traditional market tops look
like. Look for broader signals, such as sovereign wealth funds
investing in Bitcoin, corporate treasuries diversifying into crypto,
crypto company IPOs, and potential crises from over-leveraging or
restaking in the sector. 

 EVERYTHING IS A PERP (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post goes over the concept of power perpetuals, assets that
target an index price's power, in relation to three types of DeFi
primitives, including crypto-collateralized stablecoins, margined
futures, and products like Uniswap. Stablecoins are analogous to
0-perps, margined futures are 1-perps, and Uniswap-like products act
as a replicating portfolio for 0.5-perps. This uncovers a compact
design space across these central primitives in DeFi.
