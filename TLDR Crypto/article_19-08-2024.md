 RETAIL STORES ARE STUCK IN THE PAST. VENHUB'S SMART STORE IS THE
FUTURE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The inefficiencies in retail are staggering, and cost the industry
billions per year. VenHub [4] is pioneering the world's first truly
smart store [4]: fully automated, self-operating 24/7, and powered by
AI that can anticipate inventory and customer needs.

With $240m in potential pre-orders lined up [4], VenHub is promising
to tackle the most pressing issues dragging down retailers' bottom
lines â€” labor shortages, real estate prices, and shoplifting. All of
this has contributed to a 351% increase in the company's share price
[4] since May 2023.

If you're willing to act quickly, you can get shares in VenHub before

 This article examines the effectiveness of liquidity mining (LM)

MISCELLANEOUS

 ARE WE MOVING TOWARDS APP CHAINS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 There is a trend where decentralized applications (dApps) are moving
to their own sovereign chains, known as appchains, as they believe
that they are losing value due to fees being siphoned off by block
proposers and sequencers. While becoming an appchain offers control
and value capture, it's expensive and not always necessary. There are
alternative approaches like deploying on existing Layer 1/Layer 2
chains or implementing app-specific sequencing, each with their own
trade-offs. Ultimately, the decision depends on the specific needs and
goals of the dApp, as the crypto landscape offers diverse options. 

 OVERESTIMATING THE SHORT-TERM AND UNDERESTIMATING THE LONG-TERM (2

underestimating long-term impact in the current crypto cycle,
significant longer-term adoption is being observed across various
industries. Some examples include widespread stablecoin use in/on
major payment platforms, record activities in DeFi markets, rising
values in tokenized real-world assets, adoption of prediction markets
and DePin tech, breakthroughs in blockchain gaming, and the practical
use of crypto in everyday financial transactions via debit cards.
