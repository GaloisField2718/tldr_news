MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BINANCE TO ENFORCE MICA STABLECOIN LAWS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Beginning on June 30, Binance will implement phased restrictions on
"Unauthorized Stablecoins" for European Economic Area (EEA) users to
comply with new MiCA stablecoin regulations. Binance will transition
these users towards "Regulated Stablecoins" as they become available
to ensure compliance and to minimize market disruption. 

 SOLANA SEES ~500K TOKENS LAUNCHED IN MAY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 About half a million tokens were launched on Solana in May, driven by
the increasing popularity of memecoins and facilitated by intuitive,
user-friendly platforms like Pump.fun. This surge is a reflection of
Solana's high throughput and low transaction costs, thus positioning
it as a leading blockchain for new token initiatives.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE WALLET INTRODUCES TEXT-TO-SEND TOKENS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Coinbase Wallet has introduced a feature to send tokens via text to
kick off its Onchain Summer initiative. Recipient phone numbers will
receive a link to claim the tokens, which will be returned to the
sender if not claimed in 2 weeks. 

 DYNAMIC ETHEREUM ROADMAP (WEBSITE) [10] 

 This website provides up-to-date information on Ethereum's roadmap.
It breaks down the sections into the Merge, Surge, Scourge, Verge, and
Purge categories, explaining each milestone with additional learning
resources. Other valuable information is also available, including
network health, key Ethereum organizations, and upcoming hard forks.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 A FEW THINGS HAPPENING IN JUNE (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Taiko, Blast, zkSync, and AO airdrops are confirmed to occur this
month. Coinbase will release its smart wallet on June 5, and the FET,
AGIX, and OCEAN tokens will merge into ASI on June 13. Macroeconomic
news includes the unemployment rate on June 7, inflation numbers and
an interest rate decision on June 12, and the presidential debate on
June 27. 

 BEST MOMENTS OF GAVIN WOOD X VITALIK BUTERIN (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Gavin Wood's new JAM initiative takes a different approach to
blockchain scaling by admitting that a base layer does not need to
split computation between different sources. He believes Ethereum's
strength comes from moderate governance and a lack of internal strife.
Both Ethereum co-founders agree that the base layer should be minimal
and opinionless. To build an ecosystem, focus on the intersection of
community and tech, specifically tech that supports multiple
approaches to doing something.

 ETH ETF EXPLORATION (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Experts predict varying levels of inflows into the anticipated
Ethereum ETFs, with estimates suggesting inflows could range from $1
billion to 50% of Bitcoin ETF inflows during the first four months.
This increased market participation is expected to significantly
impact Ethereum's price, potentially increasing it more substantially
per billion invested compared to Bitcoin, due to factors like its
smaller market size and deflationary supply dynamics since the Merge. 

 RISKS USING KAMINO FINANCE (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Concerns are growing about the risks associated with Kamino Finance's
Multiply product, particularly after the launch of JupSOL and the
promotion of its seemingly attractive 40% APY with no depeg risk.
Despite the high user influx, the sustainability of these returns is
questionable, as the effectiveness of Multiply depends on the
borrowing interest rate for SOL being lower than the APY on the staked
tokens, a balance threatened by increasing SOL pool utilization which
could lead to negative APYs and potential liquidations for users.

QUICK LINKS

 WHY ARE THERE SO MANY L2S COMING OUT? (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The main differentiation between L2s and L1s is their ability to
modify their VM and experiment with new architectures, allowing for
programming in different languages, greater safety, or more
throughput. 

 BINANCE ACCOUNTS POTENTIALLY COMPROMISED BY AGGTRADE (1 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 A Google plugin promoted by some on Crypto Twitter has compromised at
least 1 Binance user. 

 MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETHEREUM AND SOLANA (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 While Solana is a cheap and performant blockchain, Ethereum is an
infrastructure primitive allowing for the creation of any verifiable
system, including blockchains. 

 L2 ONCHAIN PROFIT EARNED IN MAY (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Base earned the most in onchain profits last month out of all the
Ethereum L2s at ~$7M, followed by OP Mainnet, Scroll, Arbitrum, and
