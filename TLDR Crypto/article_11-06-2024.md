MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL TOKENIZES MONEY MARKET FUND ON JPMORGAN'S
BLOCKCHAIN (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Fidelity International has tokenized a money market fund on
JPMorgan's Onyx Digital Assets blockchain. It has joined the Tokenized
Collateral Network to improve efficiency and reduce transaction costs
and operational risks. 

 ETHER PRICE POISED FOR SUPPLY 'SHOCK' AS ETFS MAY ATTRACT $4B INFLOWS
IN FIVE MONTHS, K33 RESEARCH SAYS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Based on other ETH products and market analysis, K33 Research
estimates that ETH ETFs could see around 1 million ETH of inflows in
their first five months. It looked at the market share of ETH vs. BTC

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BERACHAIN V2 AND SECOND PUBLIC TESTNET NOW LIVE (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Berachain V2 focuses on technical architecture developments, keeping
its tri-token model and proof of liquidity incentive structure the
same. It introduces BeaconKit, an EVM-focused development framework
that allows any Ethereum execution client to be compatible with
Berachain V2. This upgrade also introduces single-slot finality,
greater efficiency, and an increased limit of 256 validators. 

 OPTIMISM REACHES STAGE 1 OF DECENTRALIZATION (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OP Mainnet introduced permissionless fault proofs, moving it into
Stage 1 of decentralization with plans to extend these capabilities to
more chains like Base and Metal. This upgrade enhances security by
allowing any user to challenge invalid withdrawals and includes
fail-safes like a Security Council that can revert the system to a
permissioned state if necessary. OP Mainnet aims to eventually reach
full decentralization in Stage 2.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STAKESURE & EIGENLAYER: STRONG CRYPTOECONOMIC SECURITY (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Cryptoeconomic security has historically been defined as ensuring the
cost of corruption is higher than its profit, but modeling adversaries
is extremely complex as they may act irrationally. StakeSure redefines
security by redistributing slashed funds to the protocol. It is secure
as long as the redistributable stake is greater than the harm from
corruption to the protocol. This concept is analogous to insurance on
packages: a sender chooses how much insurance they want, and if the
package is lost, money is distributed to them, regardless of what else
happens in the supply chain. 

 HOW MANY ABSTRACTIONS DO WE NEED? (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Overinvestment in crypto infrastructure obfuscates product-market fit
for consumer crypto apps, emphasizing VC gains on L1 tokens over
practical use cases. Projects are now pivoting to chain abstraction,
solving the chain and liquidity fragmentation problem created by too
many L1s. Galxe has quietly become a leader in this space, finding
sector dominance with airdrop distribution and building an identity
layer, chain abstraction vault, and the upcoming Gravity Chain.

 SOLANA MEV VALIDATOR REMOVED FROM SOLANA FOUNDATION DELEGATION
PROGRAM (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A Solana validator who performed a sandwich attack had stake
delegated to it from the Solana Foundation removed. MEV does not occur
natively on the chain since there is no mempool. The Solana
Foundation, which delegates less than 16% of all SOL staked, did not
want to support exploiting retail trades. The validator can continue
running but will not be foundation-subsidized. 

 INTRODUCING BULLPENFI â€“ AN ADVANCED TELEGRAM TRADING BOT (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 BullpenFi's first product, a highly advanced Telegram trading bot,
was designed as an all-encompassing platform for retail on-chain
trading. The platform includes a mobile-first wallet that simplifies
security with passkeys and recovery email, a trading interface that
streamlines project evaluation and trading, and generative insights
that filter and present relevant crypto discussions (especially from
Crypto Twitter) directly within Telegram.
