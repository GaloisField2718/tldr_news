INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 VISA INTRODUCES THE VISA TOKENIZED ASSET PLATFORM (4 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Visa's Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) enables banks to issue
fiat-backed tokens using blockchain. It offers banks tools for
minting, burning, and transferring tokenized fiat with easy
integration and minimal technical adjustments. Aimed at making
financial transactions more seamless and efficient, the platform will
go live with pilot programs in 2025.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR IDENTIFYING MOATS IN CRYPTO MARKETS (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 This new framework for assessing defensibility in crypto markets
proposes evaluating based on the question: ‚ÄúIf I fork this app, with
$50M in token subsidies, can I steal and maintain market share?‚Äù
Traditional moats like liquidity and TVL may be insufficient for
long-term defensibility, as they can be subsidized by well-funded
competitors. True defensibility may stem from intangibles like brand,
superior UX, and a team's innovation ability. Value capture is moving
towards front-ends and their wallets, given their proximity to end
users and access to order flow. 

 TOTAL TRANSACTION VALUE: A NEW WAY TO ASSESS ORACLES (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Though total value secured is typically used as an oracle metric,
each DeFi sector has varied price demand requiring more or less
updates. Two protocols with identical TVS can have different pricing
needs. With Chainlink, for example, Synthetix is a larger contributor
to TVS, but dYdX does over 4x more trading volume. Total Transaction
Value, calculating but summing the volume of derivative DEXs using an
oracle, is a better metric. This metric shows that market leaders are
losing.

 EIGENDA VS. CELESTIA (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Celestia and EigenDA offer distinct approaches to blockchain data
availability: Celestia focuses on data availability and consensus for
developers to build independent rollups, while EigenDA uses a
minimalist, scalable architecture that forgoes traditional blockchain
elements like consensus and P2P networking, catering to systems
requiring high throughput and low latency. 

 AERODROME AND ANDRE CRONJE DISCUSS CODEBASE LICENSES (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 DeFi pioneer Andre Cronje accused Base DEX Aerodrome of taking his
open-source code base, removing his credit, and placing a business
license on it. If true, this could be both an ethical and legal issue.
The truth of the claims is pending. The founder of Aerodrome mentioned
that he and Cronje discussed the matter privately, and ‚Äúall is
good.‚Äù
