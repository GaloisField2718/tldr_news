 FTX SEEKS PERMISSION TO SPEEDILY SELL 8% STAKE IN ANTHROPIC (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 FTX is reportedly seeking to sell its 8% stake in AI startup
Anthropic as part of its bankruptcy proceedings. It is aiming to
expedite the sale so it can be addressed in a court hearing scheduled
for February 22. FTX‚Äôs stake's exact value is undisclosed, but
Anthropic's last reported valuation was around $1.4 billion. The FTX
estate has stated that it expects to be able to repay creditors in
full and this sale is likely to be a crucial part of that plan. 

 BANKRUPT CRYPTO LENDER GENESIS SEEKS APPROVAL TO SELL $1.6B OF TRUST
ASSETS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Genesis, the infamous bankrupt crypto lending company, has requested
permission from a US Bankruptcy Court to sell approximately $1.6
billion worth of its shares in Grayscale's cryptocurrency trusts. The
company is hoping to execute these sales promptly to mitigate the
risks of asset price volatility and maximize returns for creditors.
The liquidation is important for Genesis to be able to distribute
funds to creditors. The situation highlights how the recent conversion
of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to a spot ETF enables cash redemptions.

 EIGENLAYER AND LRTS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 EigenLayer is designed to bootstrap proof-of-stake systems, which
offer staking rewards and slashing. It also offers innovative Liquid
Restaking Tokens (LRTs) to mitigate financial risks related to staked
positions. EigenLayer and its LRTs contribute to a platform's overall
financial security and liquidity. However, there are some negatives to
LRTs - they cannot participate in on-chain speculation on Eigenlayer,
and usage in lending markets could lead to liquidation cascades.

 A BRIEF HISTORY OF $BOZO: PAINTING THE PERCEPTION OF VALUE IN A
MEMECOIN (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Suspicious trading behavior around the $Bozo coin is raising concerns
about potential price manipulation through bot activity. A detailed
analysis of the coin found evidence of fraudulent trading, suggesting
most tokens are controlled by one entity manipulating the chart's
direction. This type of activity could attract uninformed investors,
hence artificially creating perceived value. This could be happening
on a broader level across the memecoin market on Solana, so users
should be cautious. 

 ON DATA AVAILABILITY LAYERS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Data availability layers are emerging as a crucial part of modular
blockchain architecture. They ensure that chain data is accessible to
all network users, thus driving down costs and enhancing blockchain
scalability. Currently, data availability accounts for around 90% of
transaction costs. However, costs can be considerably reduced with
data availability sampling, by eliminating the need to download entire
blocks of data for transaction verification. This facilitates easier
interoperability among networks, attracting a broader user base.
Startups like Avail, EigenDA, and Celestia are leading in this area,
with each offering a unique approach to infrastructure and execution.
