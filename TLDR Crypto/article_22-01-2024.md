 UNDERSTANDING BITCOIN SCALING (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Bitcoin scaling debate that began nine years ago has picked up
steam again over the past year. While Bitcoin's lack of complex
computation support once limited its uses, the success of Ethereum and
Solana have pushed some in the Bitcoin ecosystem to look for solutions
that enable use cases like DeFi and NFTs on Bitcoin. However,
Bitcoin's scaling attempts, such as Layer 2s, have struggled with
adoption challenges. There has been a renewed interest in figuring out
how to scale Bitcoin following the Taproot upgrade and the success of
Ordinals. 

 TRADING IN THE DARK: MEASURING REORDERING SLIPPAGE IN MEV (18 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This post dives into reordering slippage on Ethereum, a term for
price differences caused by transaction ordering in a block. A study
found that this slippage has potentially cost users $9m on Uniswap
alone, impacting 72% of all swaps and 92% of larger transactions over
$250k. The study also noted that Telegram trading bots had suffered
$2m in reordering slippage, indicating a potential risk vector for
crypto traders that may not be obvious to most.

 DECENTRALIZED AI (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The intersection of AI and crypto has come into focus as of late,
with centralized AI products like ChatGPT taking the world by storm.
This post explains how despite AI's propensity to centralize with more
computational strength, decentralization challenges this trend. An
increasingly decentralized AI ecosystem could foster collaborative
data sharing and mutually beneficial creation of AI models. However,
the method and degree of decentralization is a tough problem to solve,
with potential downsides being disruption to performance computing and
the lack of a truly production-ready decentralized AI model. 

 DIRECT-TO-CONTRACT INCENTIVES (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This thread introduces an innovative approach to network incentives
coined Direct-to-Contract Incentives. This methodology aims to address
traditional program shortcomings by directly incentivizing on-chain
contracts, bypassing bureaucratic inflation, and establishing a
permissionless incentives marketplace. Moreover, it offers benefits
including easy comparison, streamlined analysis, and accessible public
data due to structurally consistent infrastructure.
