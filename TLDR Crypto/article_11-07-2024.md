separation for Ethereum. In this model, builders purchase a proposal
slot, with the final price dynamically determined by the amount of
outstanding purchases. The payment is burned, similar to EIP-1559.

 CRYPTO INDUSTRY TRENDS H1 2024 (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethereum maintained its dominance among Layer 1 blockchains in the
first half of 2024, while Solana saw a resurgence. Bitcoin enjoyed
renewed interest due to Ordinals and Layer 2 solutions. Startups are
increasingly focused on infrastructure, DeFi, payment, and AI x crypto
products. There has been a noticeable geographic shift toward Asia and
Africa due to regulatory challenges in the US. 

 PERMIT2 IN SIMPLE TERMS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Uniswap's Permit2 is a novel way to improve UX for ERC-20 token
transfers. Instead of approving a transfer to an individual smart
contract, users grant a central Permit2 contract transfer authority
and then perform a signature-based approval to transfer to specific
contracts.

 SLOT-TO-PING AND ANOTHER DESCRIPTIVE MEASURE FOR BLOCKCHAINS (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The slot-to-ping (s2p) ratio is the ratio of the block production
time to the time it takes for the block to reach other validators. A
smaller s2p promotes centralization, as delays in block production
times lead to higher returns by allowing producers to include more
blocks. block-bits-per-slot-time against propagation/execution
bandwidth must also be considered as it considers block data transfers
instead of assuming it is always a tiny fraction of the slot time. 

 VITALIK BUTERIN PUSHES FOR ETHEREUM TO RESPOND TO 51% ATTACKS IN A
MORE AUTOMATED WAY (2 MINUTE READ) [11]

responses to potential 51% attacks to reduce the reliance on social
consensus and improve the network's resilience. He also highlighted
the importance of adopting light clients, ensuring quantum resistance,
and simplifying protocols for enhanced security and usability.

 BITCOIN'S DETERMINISTIC SECURITY MODEL - OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP
WORRYING AND LOVE THE HALVING (2 MINUTE READ) [14]

for security. 

 AGI WILL OBSOLETE BLOCKCHAINS (1 MINUTE READ) [15]

complex, subjective consensus and is therefore better than blockchain.
