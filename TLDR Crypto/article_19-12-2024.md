 â€˜NO TO CBDC, YES TO BITCOIN' â€” EUROPEAN MP CALLS FOR EU BTC
RESERVE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 European Parliament member Sarah Knafo has called for the EU to
establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve while opposing the European
Central Bank's digital euro initiative, characterizing the CBDC
project as having "totalitarian temptations." Knafo criticized
Europe's predominantly regulatory and taxation-focused approach to
cryptocurrencies, contrasting it with more crypto-friendly
developments in other jurisdictions like El Salvador and potential
shifts in US policy. The ECB continues to develop its digital euro
project despite these criticisms and privacy concerns, with a final
decision on implementation expected by October 2025.
