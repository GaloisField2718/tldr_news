 JAVIER MILEI BACKTRACKS ON $4.4B MEMECOIN AFTER 'INSIDERS' POCKET
$87M (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In a now-deleted tweet, president of Argentina Javier Milei endorsed
the LIBRA memecoin, a private project dedicated to encouraging the
growth of the Argentine economy. The token reached a $4.4 billion
market cap before crashing 95%. Onchain data analysis revealed alleged
insider trading activity through manipulated liquidity pools and block
0 purchases, with “insiders” reportedly extracting $87 million as
retail investors poured $1.1 billion into the token through nearly
75,000 buy orders. The incident's fallout caused a contagion effect in
the broader memecoin market, with the TRUMP token falling by $500
million within 30 minutes of Libra's collapse.

HOLDINGS (2 MINUTE READ) [5]

Bitcoin ETF holdings, highlighting a global trend of institutional
investment in cryptocurrency. This move aligns with other nations,

stance.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PUMP.FUN DOUBLES DOWN ON MEMECOIN CRAZE BY STARTING MOBILE APP AS NEW
TOKEN LAUNCH HITS RECORD (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Memecoin launchpad Pump.fun has announced a new mobile app allowing
users to create Solana-based tokens easier than ever, despite facing a
recent class-action lawsuit over securities law violations. CoinGecko
COO Bobby Ong reports that there were 600,000 token launches in
January, a 12-fold increase from the previous year, and attributes
this surge to platforms like Pump.fun. The proliferation of new tokens
has raised concerns about market fragmentation, with Ong warning that
the increasing dispersion of liquidity and trader attention could
prevent significant price movements typical of previous market cycles.


 BNB CHAIN'S $4.4M MEME LIQUIDITY SUPPORT PROGRAM (2 MINUTE READ) [7]

boost top-performing memecoins on BSC by adding permanent liquidity to
their pools. With daily and weekly rewards based on market cap, price
increase, and trading volume, this initiative aims to strengthen the
memecoin ecosystem and drive sustained growth.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 EVALUATING A TOKEN SALE: A PRACTICAL GUIDE (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This guide to evaluating token sales breaks down the assessment into
four areas: product analysis, team expertise, tokenomics, and
community metrics. The methodology assigns scores from 0-5 to each
criteria, and uses Kinto's upcoming launch as an example. According to
the framework, projects below 3.5 warrant cautious investment, while
scores above 4.0 indicate strong potential. Only 30% of January's
token sales achieved positive ROI. 

 LIMITATIONS OF SCALING BLOCKCHAINS AND WHICH VMS ARE THEORETICALLY
THE FASTEST (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Sonic (formerly Fantom) team discovered that database
optimization yielded an 800% performance increase, while parallel
transaction execution only provided a 30% improvement even under
perfect theoretical conditions. The findings challenge common
assumptions about blockchain scaling, revealing that single
high-throughput servers (like Solana and Megaeth) can achieve superior
performance compared to multi-server consensus systems. Sonic
deliberately optimizes for mesh networks to facilitate
intercommunicating programs, and the research concludes by suggesting
that traditional performance assumptions about blockchain scaling
methods may need reassessment.

MINUTE READ) [8]

exit security, and efficient keystore operations, suggesting that a
10x L1 scaling would enhance Ethereum's overall usability and
resilience.
