MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO WEEK LEGISLATION HITS SNAG IN US CONGRESS (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A procedural vote to advance three key crypto measures, including a
stablecoin framework, a token classification bill, and a ban on a U.S.
retail CBDC, was blocked by a coalition of conservative Republicans
and Democrats, casting doubt on “Crypto Week” ambitions. Speaker
Mike Johnson said he would continue negotiations and bring the package
back for another vote soon. Shares of Circle and Coinbase fell over 4%
and 1.5% respectively on the news before trimming losses. 

 POLYMARKET INVESTIGATIONS END WITHOUT CHARGES (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Both the DOJ and the CFTC have formally declined to bring charges
against Polymarket after civil and criminal probes into alleged
acceptance of US bets, despite a 2022 CFTC settlement and $1.4 million
fine requiring the platform to block US users. The investigations –
one criminal led by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office and one civil
by the CFTC – followed an April raid on CEO Shayne Coplan's
apartment but concluded with declination notices this month.
Polymarket's handling of over $3.6 billion in presidential-election
wagers underscored regulators' initial focus on market scale and
cross-border compliance.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 DAKOTA: POWERING THE FUTURE OF GLOBAL BANKING (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Dakota is building the first globally accessible business financial
account leveraging stablecoins, US Treasuries, and traditional rails.
The platform lets companies in 100+ countries open accounts, execute
SWIFT/SEPA/ACH/wire and stablecoin payments in minutes, issue smart
corporate cards, and earn up to 4% yield on balances. Since its launch
in 2024, over 500 businesses have processed billions in transactions. 

 BITWISE ADDS PROOF OF RESERVES FOR $BITB AND $ETHW ETFS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Bitwise has launched daily third-party Proof of Reserves verification
for its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs ($BITB and $ETHW). Each trading day,
the auditor confirms onchain balances and reconciles them against
outstanding ETF shares, replacing the old method of listing 90+ wallet
addresses. Soon, Bitwise will introduce daily CPA-attested reports
covering both assets and liabilities, effectively setting a new
standard for onchain transparency in public crypto funds.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HYPERLIQUID'S L1 BEGINS TO FIND ITS FOOTING (35 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 HyperEVM, Hyperliquid's EVM-compatible layer 1, has seen consistent
growth in transaction volume, TVL (now 10th among L1s), and developer
adoption since its February launch. The CoreWriter upgrade, enabling
HyperEVM contracts to write directly to HyperCore's perpetuals and
order books, is set to unlock integrated DeFi use cases and drive a
surge in applications. Native HYPE gas burns and a dual-block,
iterative rollout highlight a measured scaling approach that protects
HyperCore's performance. With trading, lending, vaults, and staking
poised to co-exist natively across both chains, HyperEVM is
transitioning from a sidecar into a core pillar of Hyperliquid's
unified financial stack. 

 3 KEY BILLS THAT COULD RESHAPE US DIGITAL ASSET LAWS (12 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Congress has declared July 14-18 as “Crypto Week” to fast-track
landmark digital asset bills aimed at solidifying U.S. leadership in
blockchain innovation. The GENIUS Act would establish the first
federal stablecoin framework, mandating 1:1 dollar backing and monthly
reserve disclosures to enable mainstream issuance by firms like Amazon
or Walmart. The CLARITY Act draws clear lines between SEC and CFTC
oversight based on token decentralization and usage, while offering
fundraising safe harbors for early-stage projects. Meanwhile, the
Anti-CBDC Act seeks to block a Federal Reserve retail digital dollar
to preserve financial privacy, collectively signaling regulatory
clarity, boosting institutional confidence, and protecting consumer
freedoms.

 ETHEREUM'S ZK ROADMAP: SCALING L1 TO 10M TPS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum is pivoting to a zkEVM-based architecture that replaces
transaction re-execution with real-time zero-knowledge proof
verification, targeting 10,000 TPS on L1 and 10M TPS ecosystem-wide.
This shift is powered by breakthroughs like Succinct's SP1 prover, a
multi-horizon roadmap backed by the Ethereum Foundation, and
innovations such as RISC-V Type 0 zkVMs and FOCIL for censorship
resistance. The ultimate goal is decentralized validation on minimal
hardware, unlocking on-chain abundance, and obsoleting optimistic
rollups. 

 ETHER.FI CASH HITS $14.85M IN SPEND, GROWS 150% IN JUNE (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Ether.fi's Cash credit product has crossed $14.85M in total spend
since launch, with June alone driving 40% of volume and 1,741 new
cardholders. With 3,400+ active users and 400 businesses onboarding,
the team is aiming for 40K-100K users by year-end, leveraging deep
integration with its yield vaults. The 3% cashback, currently
subsidized by Scroll, may be adjusted as interchange fees and
vault-linked monetization scale, positioning Ether.fi as a
crypto-native challenger to fintech giants like Revolut and Robinhood.
