 GLOBAL CRYPTO INVESTMENT PRODUCTS HIT RECORD $44 BILLION NET INFLOWS
IN 2024 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Crypto investment products like ETFs reached $44.2 billion in net
inflows in 2024, nearly quadrupling 2021's record of $10.5 billion.

Ethereum products saw late-year momentum pushing them to $4.8 billion.


 GAMING, LAYER 2 TOKEN INDICES POST LOSSES FOR 2024, WHILE ALL OTHER
SECTORS GAINED (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While most crypto sectors gained value in 2024, gaming and Layer 2
indices posted notable losses of 16% and 30% respectively, despite the
broader market gaining 90%. The gaming index's decline notably
excludes TON's 100% gain from Telegram-based gaming growth, while
Layer 2 losses were driven by Polygon and Arbitrum. The L2 sector
could see renewed momentum early in 2025 with the launch of new chains
like Uniswap's Unichain, MegaETH, and Abstract.
