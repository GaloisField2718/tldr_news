MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FIFTH CIRCUIT RULES OFAC OVERSTEPPED IN SANCTIONING TORNADO CASH'S
IMMUTABLE SMART CONTRACTS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court has ruled that the Treasury Department
exceeded its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash's immutable smart
contracts, determining that autonomous software lacking centralized
control cannot be classified as sanctionable property under existing
law. While marking a significant victory for privacy advocates and
blockchain developers, the ruling specifically applies only to
self-executing code without administrative control, leaving Tornado
Cash's broader designation and blocked status intact. The case is
returning to district court for further consideration under the new
legal framework. 

 TRUMP EYES HANDING CFTC OVERSIGHT OF CRYPTO (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 President-elect Trump's administration is reportedly planning to
shift crypto industry oversight to the CFTC, potentially reducing the
SEC's regulatory control over digital assets deemed commodities and
crypto exchanges. The CFTC has a significantly smaller workforce and
budget and is viewed favorably by the industry for its more measured
regulatory approach. Leadership changes in the SEC, including Chair
Gary Gensler's resignation and Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga's
departure, coincide with the upcoming regulatory restructuring

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AVALANCHE BLOCKCHAIN'S LARGEST-EVER UPGRADE GOES LIVE ON TESTNET (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Avalanche has launched Avalanche9000, its largest upgrade, making it
easier to build apps and custom blockchains ("subnets") on the
platform. Avalanche900 was launched on the testnet to reduce
transaction and validator costs. Its key features include cheaper
permissionless validators and lower fees. Avalanche has launched a $40
million grants program to incentivize developers to experiment and
create. 

 INTRODUCING EIGENGOV: PART 1 (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 EigenLayer has introduced EigenGov, a novel governance platform
designed to coordinate ecosystem participants through a network of
specialized councils with specific authorities over protocol
decisions. Its structure has councils making primary decisions while
EIGEN tokenholders retain veto power and endorsement capabilities,
inverting traditional DAO models where tokenholders delegate power to
representatives. The platform will have a “Core” branch for
production and a “Vision” branch for experimental features.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AERODROME DEEP DIVE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AerodromeFi has emerged as the dominant DEX on Coinbase's Base chain.
It drives over 50% of Base's TVL, offering unmatched liquidity
efficiency through its veAERO flywheel. Aligned with Coinbase's
strategy for onchain growth, Aerodrome is positioned to play a pivotal
role in expanding global DeFi access, supported by major investors and
innovative partnerships like Universal Asset. 

 ETH IS PERMISSIONLESS MONEY (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ETH is a new form of permissionless money. It cannot be censored or
shut down by a third party. ETH has a low inflation rate of 0.8%, the
same as Bitcoin's for the next four years, and is ultimately aligned
with the general expectation of a currency's inflation schedule. Even
with low rollup fees, enough rollups could lead to massive ETH burn
and solidify the asset as the best data availability and settlement
layer.

 AI AGENTS COULD BE THIS CYCLE'S STEP FUNCTION UNLOCK (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 AI agents are emerging as a powerful new crypto trend. They initially
function like memecoins but have the potential to evolve into
“ownable agents” with their own tokens that grow in value as their
utility and prominence increase. With advances in ease of creation,
distribution, and compelling narratives about their future potential,
these agents have the potential to catalyze a new cycle of crypto
adoption, much like NFTs and DeFi did in previous cycles. 

 THOUGHTS ON BULL CYCLE TIMELINE(S) (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The next major market correction is predicted to come around Q1 2025,
coinciding with the announcement of U.S. crypto regulations. However,
a long-term positive regulatory framework could lead to a rally
post-correction, particularly benefiting fundamentally strong
“Dino” coins like AAVE, MKR, and ETH, which could set the stage
for a potential multi-year supercycle.

 MOROCCO DRAFTING CRYPTO LAW (1 MINUTE READ) [13]

Ethereum's first lead since 2022.
