 JPMORGAN: S&P 500 REJECTION OF STRATEGY A SETBACK FOR CRYPTO
TREASURIES (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The S&P 500 committee's decision to reject Strategy's inclusion
despite meeting criteria is a “blow to crypto treasuries,”
signaling reluctance to add firms that function as bitcoin funds. The
move limits Strategy's ability to channel bitcoin exposure into major
benchmarks, raising the risk that other index providers could also
reconsider. Analysts warned that fatigue is growing around
treasury-focused firms, with capital potentially shifting instead
toward exchanges and miners with operating businesses. 

 SEC CHAIR CALLS FOR CLEAR RULES TO UNLOCK ONCHAIN CAPITAL RAISING (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SEC Chair Paul Atkins said entrepreneurs and investors should be able
to raise capital onchain “without endless legal uncertainty,”
reaffirming that most crypto tokens are not securities. He outlined
“Project Crypto,” aimed at modernizing securities rules to enable
onchain trading, lending, and staking under a unified framework.
Atkins criticized the prior administration for driving innovation
offshore and said the new SEC approach is to provide the “minimum
effective dose” of regulation to protect investors while fostering
growth.

 INTRODUCING THE X402 BAZAAR (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Coinbase's x402 is an open payments standard that allows any online
service to be monetized and paid for via crypto-based
microtransactions. The x402 bazaar enables dynamic, self-improving
agents that can browse before they pay, which unlocks complex
workflows that previously required developers to directly sign up and
pre-pay for services like LLM inference, financial analysis, and web
scraping. 

 UPBIT EXCHANGE LAUNCHES ETHEREUM L2 (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Upbit, the largest South Korean crypto exchange, has launched its
Giwa layer 2 on testnet. The layer 2 is built on the OP stack and aims
for one-second block times and a friendly user experience. Details
about the mainnet launch, ecosystem partners, and explicit purpose of
the chain remain unclear, but this is the latest in a flurry of L2
announcements from major entities like Sony and Robinhood.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MARKETS NEED RULES, AND CRYPTO IS NO DIFFERENT (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto markets require clear regulatory frameworks to achieve broad
adoption, countering both the "regulatory free-for-all" approach
favored by some crypto advocates and the current hostile regulatory
environment. There are four essential objectives for crypto
regulation: predictability and stability, protection of property
rights, transparency and information clarity, and fair competition.
The SEC's approach of pursuing enforcement actions without first
establishing clear legal standards creates uncertainty that stifles
innovation while allowing bad actors to operate in regulatory grey
zones. Crypto-specific regulation should recognize blockchain
technology as both a financial system and a web infrastructure
platform, requiring specialized frameworks like token taxonomy,
decentralization standards, and guidelines that enable legitimate
businesses to operate without fear of arbitrary prosecution. 

 THE BOROS FUNDING RATE TRADE (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Boros is a new Pendle-built platform that enables direct trading of
funding rates rather than underlying assets or perpetual contracts.
The strategy, called "Optimistic Funding Rate Trading," involves
longing rates when Binance's real-time funding rate rises above the
market's implied rate and shorting when it falls below, attempting to
capture both settlement gains and price movements from rate shifts.
The approach relies on timing market sentiment cycles in funding
rates, with traders earning the spread between actual funding
settlements and their locked-in fixed rate, plus potential profits
from correctly anticipating rate direction changes. This is high-risk
in nature, and there is potential for significant losses from mistimed
entries or misjudged market shifts.

 FROM WORLD COMPUTER TO GUARANTEE MACHINE (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A developer building a real-time fitness aggregator demonstrates why
blockchains are fundamentally unsuitable for most applications by
detailing how a simple Python app becomes impossible to implement
onchain. The app easily handles continuous data streams, event-driven
updates, external API calls, real-time processing, and hot deployments
using traditional web infrastructure, but each capability is blocked
by blockchain constraints like determinism requirements, oracle
dependencies, gas costs, and sandboxed execution environments.
Blockchain applications remain toy-like because they're designed
around extreme blockchain limitations rather than actual user needs. A
new approach is needed to bridge the gap between computational
requirements and verifiable guarantees. 

 BASTION PROPOSES TO ISSUE HYPERLIQUID'S USDH STABLECOIN (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Bastion, a regulated stablecoin issuer with a New York trust charter
and broad MTL coverage, has submitted its proposal to issue
Hyperliquid's native USDH. Unlike other contenders, Bastion doesn't
run a competing chain or stablecoin, positioning itself as a neutral
infrastructure partner with strong U.S. regulatory compliance. The
proposal calls for USDH to be a full-stack stablecoin with segregated,
bankruptcy-remote reserves, 95% of yield reinvested into Hyperliquid
growth, and global on/off-ramp access via partners like Rain,
LayerZero, and Securitize. Bastion argues USDH should serve as the
base stablecoin for the ecosystem, with others built on top of it
rather than as wrappers.
