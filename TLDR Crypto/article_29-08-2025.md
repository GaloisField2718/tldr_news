MARKETS & BUSINESS

 JPMORGAN BELIEVES BITCOIN IS UNDERVALUED, SEES $126K BY YEAR-END (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin's current price is “too low” relative to gold as
volatility hits record lows, setting a fair value of $126,000 by
year-end. Corporate treasury accumulation, index-driven inflows from
Strategy and Metaplanet, and reduced volatility seems to have boosted
bitcoin's institutional appeal. With BTC's volatility ratio to gold at
a record 2.0, Bitcoin is closer than ever to gold on a risk-adjusted
basis. 

 US GOVERNMENT PUBLISHES MACROECONOMIC DATA ONCHAIN (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The U.S. Commerce Department has begun distributing key macroeconomic
data on public blockchains in partnership with Chainlink and Pyth,
starting with GDP and inflation indicators anchored to Bitcoin,
Ethereum, Solana, Base, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism, opening new
use cases for DeFi, prediction markets, and tokenized assets. The data
is hashed onchain to ensure integrity. Secretary Howard Lutnick says
the move makes “America's economic truth immutable and globally
accessible,” highlighting 3.3% GDP growth as the first data point
published.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 EULEREARN: PASSIVE YIELD, PROFESSIONALLY CURATED (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 EulerEarn is a permissionless passive yield platform where anyone can
deploy and manage ERC-4626 vault strategies without gatekeeping. It
features non-custodial, immutable core contracts with timelock and
guardian protections for risk-sensitive actions. The system enables
curators to professionally manage up to 30 strategies per vault with
defined allocation caps, supply/withdrawal queues, and yield smearing
mechanisms to optimize returns while maintaining liquidity and
reducing MEV risks. Curators can earn up to 50% performance fees while
users hold a single token representing their aggregated pool share.
The platform supports full ERC20Votes governance functionality for
community-driven control. 

 INTRODUCING $AVNT: THE TOKEN FOR UNIVERSAL LEVERAGE (12 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Avantis, a leading derivatives DEX on Base, has launched $AVNT, a
utility and governance token designed to secure its protocol, align
incentives, and decentralize governance. Since its February 2024
mainnet debut, Avantis has processed $18B+ in volume, onboarded
38,500+ traders, and listed 80+ markets. The token grants stakers fee
discounts and rewards, dedicates 50.1% of supply to community
incentives, and aims to scale its "Universal Leverage Layer" to
capture demand in the $1 quadrillion RWA derivatives market.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE INVISIBLE UPGRADE: WHY INSTITUTIONS SHOULD CARE ABOUT CRYPTO
RAILS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Institutional finance is undergoing a fundamental infrastructure
upgrade through crypto rails, moving beyond speculative use cases to
address core operational inefficiencies in traditional systems like
T+2 settlement and fragmented reconciliation processes. Zero-knowledge
proofs enable institutions to maintain privacy while proving
compliance, solvency, or creditworthiness without exposing sensitive
portfolio data to centralized gatekeepers who create security
vulnerabilities. Ethereum's L2 scaling solutions offer real-time
settlement and near-zero cost transactions with built-in execution
guarantees, while smart contracts can enforce compliance, portfolio
limits, and trading mandates natively rather than through retrofitted
oversight systems. 

 HIRING FOR CRYPTO BD ROLES (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hiring for BD in crypto is different from Web2 because tokens, DAOs,
and open-source ecosystems change how partnerships and growth work.
Early-stage teams need scrappy hires who can experiment and adapt, but
after product-market fit, you need specialists who can scale pipelines
and systems. Defining roles clearly and avoiding over-hiring too
senior or too generalist too early is critical to unlocking
sustainable growth.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW MONAD GOT CT ON ITS SIDE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Monad's "Monad Cards" distribution strategy targets crypto
influencers with established relevance, rewarding organic social
capital rather than project-specific engagement. Unlike common pre-TGE
growth hacks, this approach leverages decentralized nominations to
reduce insider bias and align with crypto's cultural emphasis on
fairness. By empowering recipients to nominate others, Monad addresses
historical criticisms of airdrop centralization, enhancing perceived
legitimacy and fostering a stronger foundation for its ecosystem. 

 LIQUIDITY AS AN OPERATING SYSTEM (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 HyperEVM is a programmable financial operating system built directly
on top of Hyperliquid's profitable exchange infrastructure, which
processes $300B monthly volume and generates over $1B annualized
profit. It differentiates from typical EVM chains by being natively
integrated with proven liquidity and user demand, allowing developers
to access existing trading flows and monetization primitives,
including Builder Codes, HIP-3 market deployment fees, and HYPE
staking rewards from day one.
