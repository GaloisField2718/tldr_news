MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CANTOR FITZGERALD AGREED TO ACQUIRE 5% STAKE IN TETHER FOR UP TO
$600M (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cantor Fitzgerald has acquired a 5% stake in Tether valued at
approximately $600 million, coinciding with the appointment of CEO
Howard Lutnick as Trump's Secretary of Commerce. The financial
services firm holds the majority of Tether's $134 billion USDT
reserves in Treasury bills, acting as the stablecoin issuer's primary
banking partner. The political implications of this arrangement are
significant, as Lutnick's new role could influence regulatory
oversight of Tether, particularly as the company faces investigations
for potential illicit activities. 

 SUI ENTERS PARTNERSHIP WITH FRANKLIN TEMPLETON DIGITAL ASSETS (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Franklin Templeton, a firm with $1.5 trillion in assets under
management, has formed a strategic partnership with the Sui network to
support ecosystem builders and deploy novel blockchain technologies.
The partnership follows Grayscale's earlier establishment of the
Grayscale SUI Trust and the launch of major stablecoins like USDC on
the network.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BETTER UNDERSTANDING ACCOUNT ABSTRACTION (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Account Abstraction (AA) simplifies Ethereum wallets by enabling
externally owned accounts (EOAs) to function like smart contracts and
supporting advanced features like custom signature schemes (e.g.,
Passkeys). Various EIPs support this (EIP-4337, EIP-3074, and
EIP-7702). EIP-4337 enables smart contract wallets, EIP-3074 couples
EOAs with smart contracts using new opcodes, and EIP-7702 delegates
EOA functionality to external contracts without requiring major EVM
changes. 

 A LOOK INTO EIP-7805 (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethereum's block production is highly centralized, with two entities
(Beaverbuild and Titanbuild) responsible for over 95% of blocks,
raising concerns about potential transaction censorship. EIP-7805
proposes FOCIL (Fork-choice Enforced Inclusion Lists) to enforce the
inclusion of specific transactions in blocks, improving censorship
resistance without altering the centralization of block-building
itself.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MEMECOIN MARKET MAP - A $120B ASSET CLASS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The memecoin sector has been leading the industry in terms of
mindshare and retail volume, surpassing DeFi with a market cap
exceeding $120 billion. It has evolved since Dogecoin's early
dominance through various phases, including the rise of Shiba Inu,
Pepe, and Solana-based memes, with new trends emerging nearly weekly
this year. Dog-themed tokens remain the largest category, but new
coins in the Internet Culture and Sentient AI categories are emerging.
Memecoins will likely follow the broader crypto market, with a few
established coins maintaining longevity while new opportunities in
untapped themes. 

 FRAGMENTATION TO FUSION: INTENTION IS ALL YOU NEED (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Current intent-based applications like CoW Swap and UniswapX operate
in isolation, creating fragmented ecosystems that limit broader market
efficiency and user experience. A new framework, the Modular Intent
Stack, along with the ERC-7683 standard from Across and Uniswap, aims
to create a unified infrastructure for cross-chain intents and solver
integration. The implementation's three components, standardized
intent representation, propagation via DA networks, and decentralized
solver selection through Auction AVSs, could transform the fragmented
landscape into an “invisible garden” with seamless interactions
and composability.

 BEYOND SPECULATION AND STABLECOINS: CRYPTO'S NEXT PHASE? (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The crypto industry is emerging from a two-year consolidation phase
characterized by infrastructure optimization rather than
groundbreaking innovation, with speculation and stablecoins emerging
as the dominant use cases. Technical improvements have led to abundant
blockspace, near-zero transaction fees, and mature tooling, while
established protocols like Solana, Ethereum, and Uniswap continue to
strengthen their market positions. The next phase of development
hinges on regulatory clarity and an influx of new talent. 

 COST OF SPINNING UP A NEW CHAIN (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Launching a new blockchain is very costly, requiring tens of millions
of dollars for top-tier infrastructure, ecosystem development,
operational costs (e.g., L1 validators, L2 sequencers), and legal
compliance. This makes it unlikely that the industry will be able to
sustain thousands of chains, so it will probably stabilize to around a
few hundred.
