 LIBRA - RUGGED (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Argentina's president, Javier Milei, endorsed and then quickly

extracting millions while retail investors were left with heavy
losses. This scandal, which featured fraudulent promotions, insider
trading, and political fallout, highlights the growing trend of
political tokens being used as get-rich-quick schemes rather than true
