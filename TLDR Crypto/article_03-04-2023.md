ARBITRUM FOUNDATION SOLD ARB TOKENS AHEAD OF 'RATIFICATION' VOTE; ARB
FALLS (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/02/contentious-arbitrum-vote-over-1b-in-tokens-ratification-not-request-says-foundation/]


Over the weekend, there was quite a bit of drama with Arbitrumâ€™s
AIP-1, its first DAO proposal. The initial proposal called for 750
million $ARB tokens to be distributed to the Arbitrum Foundation to
make special grants, reimburse applicable service providers, and cover
ongoing administrative and operational costs. The AIP also accounted
for a $3.5m budget to set up the legal structure for the foundation.
Before the vote was finished, the Arbitrum Foundation sold 10m $ARB
tokens to pay for these setup costs and other expenses owed to service
providers. The AIP ended up being voted against, and the Arbitrum
Foundation will be proposing new AIPs this week. 

BITTREX SHUTS DOWN US CRYPTO EXCHANGE DUE TO 'REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT'
(2 MINUTE READ)
[https://decrypt.co/125087/crypto-exchange-bittrex-shut-down-us-operations?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Bittrex, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced it is ceasing
operations in the country due to an unfavorable regulatory and
economic environment. Trading for clients will continue until April
14, and customer funds must be withdrawn by April 30. Bittrex CEO
Richie Lai cited unclear and unevenly enforced regulatory requirements
as reasons for shutting down. The exchange will continue to operate
its Bittrex Global platform for traders outside the US. This decision
follows a series of fines and regulatory crackdowns on American crypto
companies.

GNOSIS LAUNCHES HASHI BRIDGE AGGREGATOR TO HELP PREVENT HACKS (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://cointelegraph.com/news/gnosis-launches-hashi-bridge-aggregator-to-help-prevent-hacks?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Gnosis has launched Hashi, a hash oracle aggregator aimed at enhancing
the security of blockchain bridges by requiring multiple bridges to
validate a withdrawal before confirmation. Several bridge protocols,
including Succinct Labs, DendrETH, ZK Collective, Connext, Celer,
LayerZero, Axiom, Wormhole, and LI.FI, have committed to integrating
with Hashi. By requiring agreement from multiple bridges, Hashi helps
prevent multi-sig governance attacks and ensures cross-chain
transactions are more secure. Bridges have been some of the most
vulnerable attack vectors in crypto, resulting in over $2 billion of
stolen funds in 2021 and 2022. This is a novel solution to address
this weak spot. 

A PROCEDURALLY GENERATED FRONTEND FOR EVERY ETHEREUM CONTRACT (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1641890861637324801.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Universal Frontend is a procedurally generated frontend for every
Ethereum contract, aimed at streamlining interaction with any
contract. The platform outlines all contract functions and enables
inline entry of function parameters, including structs, arrays, and
tuples. The tool provides feedback on parameter issues and even
features a "magic uint." Monobase, the successor of solidlint, aims to
become the go-to platform for contract interaction, with Universal
Query coming soon.

DEFINING REAL AND FAKE DAOS (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://lexnode.substack.com/p/defining-real-and-fake-daos?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This article highlights how the term "DAO" has become increasingly
vague as it has taken on a variety of applications. A true DAO should
meet three criteria: be decentralized, autonomous, and an
organization. "Decentralized" means power is widely dispersed or
distributed, while "autonomous" refers to self-governance and
independence, requiring censorship-resistant technologies. An
"organization" is an association of individuals pursuing common goals.
To be a DAO, an entity should check all these boxes separately. Many
supposed DAOs fail to meet these criteria, merely using smart
contracts superficially. 

HOW WILL ETHEREUM'S MULTI-CLIENT PHILOSOPHY INTERACT WITH ZK-EVMS? (15
MINUTE READ)
[https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/03/31/zkmulticlient.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Ethereum's security and decentralization are supported by its
multi-client philosophy. A significant upcoming transition for
Ethereum chain validation is the rise of ZK-EVMs, which are already
used by L2 protocols called ZK rollups. In the future, ZK-EVMs will be
crucial for verifying L1 execution, becoming a third type of Ethereum
client. As ZK-EVMs integrate with the multi-client philosophy, the
challenge lies in creating a multi-client ecosystem for ZK-proving
Ethereum block correctness. The long-term goal is to make Ethereum
blocks smaller, enabling anyone to run a fully verifying node on their
device, while preserving the multi-client philosophy's benefits.

WHITE PAPER ALLEGING FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ARE WAGING WAR AGAINST
THE CRYPTOCURRENCY INDUSTRY (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-white-paper-uncovers-how-federal-banking-regulators-are-waging-operation-choke-point-2-0-against-the-cryptocurrency-industry-301782467.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


A white paper from law firm Cooper & Kirk alleges that federal bank
regulators, including the FDIC, Federal Reserve Board, and OCC, may be
engaging in a covert financial war against the crypto industry. The
tactics resemble those used during "Operation Choke Point," which
targeted politically unpopular businesses. Crypto businesses are
experiencing debanking and loss of access to the ACH network. The law
firm, which previously sued regulators over Operation Choke Point,
calls for Congress to hold regulators accountable and stop this
potential "Operation Choke Point 2.0."
