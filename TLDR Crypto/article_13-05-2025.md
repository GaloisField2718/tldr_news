MARKETS & BUSINESS

 JD VANCE TO SPEAK AT BITCOIN 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Vice President JD Vance will become the first sitting U.S. vice
president to publicly endorse Bitcoin when he delivers a keynote at
Bitcoin 2025 on May 28 in Las Vegas. His address will build on prior
Senate advocacy against regulatory overreach and in favor of financial
sovereignty. Vance's personal Bitcoin holdings, estimated between
$250,000 and $500,000, add weight to his remarks on innovation and the
future of American finance. 

 SEC CHAIR PAUL ATKINS UNVEILS HIS VISION FOR CRYPTO REGULATION (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SEC Chair Paul Atkins has announced a shift in the agency's crypto
regulatory approach, outlining a more constructive, rules-based
framework to foster innovation. Criticizing the prior administration's
resistance to adapting to digital assets, Atkins plans to modernize
custody rules and introduce regulatory flexibility for emerging crypto
products.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ACROSS PRIME (20 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Across Prime introduces a trustless “bonded” relay model that
replaces traditional escrow, enabling bridge operators to receive
payments instantly using reusable collateral. By decoupling relay
collateral from slow-settlement oracles, it reduces bridging to just
two transactions while supporting high-throughput transfers. The
system remains compatible with ERC-7683 intents and allows for
extensions like arbitrary bond collateral and multi-destination
routes, defaulting to escrow only when bonds are insufficient. 

 PUMP.FUN LAUNCHES CREATOR REVENUE SHARING (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Pump.fun now shares 50% of PumpSwap trading revenue with coin
creators, granting them 5 basis points (0.05%) in SOL per trade on
their tokens. Eligible creators – including those with newly
launched coins, coins still on the bonding curve, or those graduated
to PumpSwap – can now claim on-chain rewards directly through their
profile.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 COINBASE CRYPTO ANALYST CALL (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Coinbase anticipates decentralized exchanges will eventually surpass
centralized ones in volume. To capture this shift, it is integrating
on-chain settlement through the Coinbase Wallet frontend. Executives
view TradFi players like Stripe and Robinhood as market-expanding
tailwinds rather than threats. Strategic efforts include acquiring
Deribit and Spindl, pursuing approval for U.S. perpetual futures, and
securing licenses in Argentina and India. Venture holdings, carried at
cost, offer asymmetric upside potential if crypto adoption outpaces
expectations. 

 WHY FORTNITE NEVER CAME TO CRYPTO (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Fortnite's 650 million users and $400 million creator economy appear
ideal for NFTs, but Epic CEO Tim Sweeney prioritizes interoperability
via APIs and open standards over blockchain-based ownership. While
Epic is opening Fortnite assets to external games, challenges like
royalties, IP rights, and platform moderation hinder cross-platform
compatibility. Without NFTs that provide neutral ownership and
programmable royalties, users remain under centralized control.

 PECTRA LETS HACKERS DRAIN WALLETS WITH JUST AN OFFCHAIN SIGNATURE (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum developers are investigating an exploit vector introduced by
the Pectra upgrade that allows wallets to be drained via malicious
off-chain signatures. Users can unknowingly sign payloads later
executed via permissive approvals. Core teams are now focused on
improving signature UX and educating users on the risks of off-chain
signing. 

 MOUNTAIN PROTOCOL TO BE ACQUIRED BY ANCHORAGE DIGITAL (3 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Mountain Protocol, issuer of the USDM stablecoin, has signed an
agreement to be acquired by Anchorage Digital, the only federally
chartered crypto bank in the U.S. As part of the transition, the
minting of USDM was halted yesterday. Existing users will continue to
be supported. The acquisition aims to strengthen institutional
stablecoin infrastructure.
