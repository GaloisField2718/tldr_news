GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 LIQUID CRYPTO IS THE BIGGEST UNTAPPED INVESTABLE SEGMENT FOR CRYPTO
FUNDS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Liquid crypto, defined as funds investing in already liquid assets
without encumbrances, presents a significant investment opportunity
but faces challenges including fund performance volatility and
reputational risks from potential asset theft. Despite the rise of
low-fee ETF alternatives, liquid funds may continue to be dominated by
proprietary capital from Chicago and Asia due to these complexities
and the need for strong risk tolerance from top management. 

 THE ULTIMATE BRIDGE RANKING (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 For L2 to L2 transactions, Orbiter offers low fees, high speed, and a
points system for future tokens. For USDC, Circle's CCTP offers a flat
$1 fee, but takes 20-30 minutes. Squid Router is the best choice for
Cosmos-based bridging. DeBridge is fast, has a points system, and can
bridge between EVM chains and Solana.

 CAPITAL FORMATION INCENTIVES IN CRYPTO (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Capital formation incentives in crypto are heavily influenced by
existing market dynamics, with pressure to conform to established
norms affecting both new teams and investors. Despite the shift away
from ICOs, retail investors have been disadvantaged, leading to
distorted market structures and challenges for startups trying to
break the mold. 

 CRYPTO CYCLE WOES (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The trend of companies staying private longer reflects a shift
similar to what happened with VC and IPO markets, where significant
gains are captured by private equity, sidelining retail investors from
early profits. In crypto, a similar pattern has emerged with key L1
and L2s raising substantial funds from VCsl, excluding retail
investors from early, lucrative investing opportunities.
