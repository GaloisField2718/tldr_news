 JAPAN MOVES CLOSER TO ALLOWING VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS TO HOLD CRYPTO
ASSETS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Japanese government has greenlit a bill allowing venture capital
firms and investment funds to acquire crypto assets. Should it pass
parliament, it could be a huge catalyst for web3 startups in the
country, as the inability of funds to hold crypto assets greatly
restricts the flow of early-stage capital. This amendment aligns with
Japan's previously indicated plans to support the crypto sector while
still attempting to protect users. 

 SOUTH KOREA‚ÄôS RULING PARTY CONSIDERS ALLOWING SPOT BITCOIN ETFS IN
ELECTION PLEDGES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 South Korea's People Power Party is considering making promises
around cryptocurrencies for the general election in April. Proposals
include allowing spot bitcoin ETFs, institutional investments in
cryptocurrencies, and initial exchange offerings. These campaign
strategies are an effort to attract young voters, as over 80% of the
country's cryptocurrency holders are aged between 20 and 30. These
pledges could spark significant changes in the country's current
stringent crypto regulations.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHENA MAINNET AND SHARD CAMPAIGN: EPOCH 1 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ethena, a synthetic dollar with native yield, officially launched on
mainnet yesterday. It is now rolling out its official Shard campaign,
which rewards users based on their activity and involvement in the
protocol. The campaign will occur over several short-term periods, or
'Epochs', each concentrating on different activities and communities.
The initiative is aimed at long-term participants in the ecosystem and
will diminish in value over time. 

 BASELINE: AN AUTOMATED TOKENOMICS ENGINE FOR ERC20 TOKENS (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Baseline, an automated tokenomics engine for ERC20 tokens, was
created to improve token launches on the upcoming Blast L2. It seeks
to create more efficient and equitable markets through protocol-owned
liquidity. The platform's key features include deterministic market
making, native credit, and Baseline Value, which offers a guaranteed
minimal buy value behind each token. The protocol aims to eliminate
the unpredictability often associated with on-chain token launches
while offering stable and always available liquidity.

 STRATEGIES FOR TAKING PROFITS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post lays out strategies crypto traders can use for
profit-taking and avoiding getting caught up in the hype of the bull
market. The author‚Äôs strategy for profit-taking on short-term
positions is largely based on upcoming catalysts like media trends and
significant moves by smart money. His long-term strategies rely more
on recognizing signals that might indicate a bull cycle's end. 

 DISSECTING THE POINTS META: BEST PRACTICES FOR USER LOYALTY (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This post discusses some thoughts from a crypto VC on loyalty and
points programs, one of the latest metas in the space. The discussion
examines the efficacy of these programs, their impact on user
retention and acquisition, and the relationship between points and
tokens. While there are legal and regulatory implications for
transferring points to tokens, points can be an effective way to
acquire customers and keep them engaged.

 WORLDCOIN‚ÄôS ROCKETING WLD TOKEN COULD BENEFIT CREDITORS OF THREE
ARROWS CAPITAL, FTX (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The announcement of Sora by OpenAI last week, which caused most
AI-related tokens‚Äô prices to rise, resulted in Worldcoin's WLD
tokens surging over 200%. This surge in WLD‚Äôs value could be a great
benefit to creditors of Three Arrows Capital and FTX. However, the
current price is based on the fully diluted valuation of the coin,
which could be impacted materially by upcoming token unlocks. 

 A HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE VIEW ON THE HISTORY OF ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOFS (13
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This blog post provides a detailed overview of zk-SNARKs,
cryptographic tools that quickly verify proofs of a statement's truth
without revealing other information. The piece traces the development
of zk-SNARKs from their origins in the 1980s to modern, optimized
variations. It highlights the surge of cryptographic proofs over the
past years, propelled by advances in computer science, mathematics,
and hardware, alongside the rise of blockchain technology. While
initially, two main lines of these types of proofs (SNARKs vs. STARKs)
existed, the differences between them have blurred, evidence that
these kinds of proofs will likely continue to evolve in the future.
