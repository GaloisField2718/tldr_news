MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO FUNDS SEE $2B WEEKLY OUTFLOWS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 CoinShares reported $2 billion in outflows from global crypto
investment products, the largest weekly exit since February, as
shifting US rate cut expectations and selling from large holders
dampened sentiment. The US led with 97% of redemptions, while Germany
bucked the trend with $13 million in inflows. Bitcoin funds saw $1.38
billion in withdrawals and Ethereum $689 million, while multi-asset
ETPs attracted $69 million as investors sought diversified exposure
amid macro-driven volatility. 

 BITCOIN'S 25% SLIDE REFLECTS SHORT-TERM CORRECTION (4 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Bitcoin's 25% drop from its October 6 all-time high of $126,000
reflects investor anxiety over historical four-year cycle peaks rather
than weakening fundamentals. 340,000 BTC sold by long-term holders was
absorbed by $34 billion in ETF inflows and corporate treasuries.
Institutional ETF ownership climbed from 20% to 28% with $125 billion
in assets under management despite recent outflows, while Strategy's
conservative leverage ratio of $8 billion debt against $61 billion in
bitcoin holdings dismisses liquidation concerns. A shallow correction
is expected rather than the typical 60-70% drawdown as structural
tailwinds remain intact.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 1INCH LAUNCHES ‘AQUA' TO UNIFY DEFI LIQUIDITY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 1inch Aqua is a shared liquidity model designed to eliminate DeFi's
capital fragmentation by turning every wallet into a self-custodial
AMM, allowing the same capital to power multiple strategies
simultaneously. Developers can now access Aqua's SDK, libraries, and
bounties up to $100,000. Aqua is positioned as a foundational
liquidity primitive that removes deposit and withdrawal logic while
boosting efficiency across chains. The launch at Devconnect builds on
1inch's aggregation success and aims to create a capital-efficient
base layer for DeFi composability. 

 AAVE APP: A SMARTER WAY TO SAVE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Aave is launching an app that allows users to earn up to 9% on
stablecoin balances. It uses embedded wallets to create an email-based
sign-up solution, mitigating the need to interact with a complex
browser wallet and web interface. Aave will offer insurance on
deposits up to $1 million per user. The waitlist is currently live.
There is no clear launch date yet.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW YIELD IS ACTUALLY MADE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 DeFi vaults automate yield generation through smart contracts that
deposit assets, allocate to protocols like Aave and Curve, compound
returns, and continuously rebalance positions across nine core
strategies, including yield aggregation, delta-neutral hedging,
leveraged farming, and options-based derivatives. The Stream Finance
case exposed systemic risk when curator failures triggered $93 million
in cascading losses across interconnected protocols, demonstrating how
recursive vault loops and poor management amplifies contagion beyond
protocol boundaries. Vaults simplified DeFi from complex multi-step
strategies into single-action deposits, but the next phase requires
stricter audits, DAO-based curator approvals, and transparent
proof-of-reserves dashboards to balance automation with accountability
as smart contract bugs and oracle manipulation remain persistent
attack vectors. 

 WHY YOUR COIN ISN'T PUMPING (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto prices remain depressed despite ETF launches and institutional
adoption because blockchains trade at software multiples on casino
revenue, with Ethereum at 200-400x price-to-sales on $1-2 billion in
cyclical fees versus Nvidia's 40-45x price-to-earnings with recurring
contracts. The industry deployed over $100 billion into
infrastructure, while the entire crypto ecosystem serves roughly 40
million active users, compared to OpenAI's rumored $1 trillion IPO
valuation serving 20x more users. Ethereum faces structural value
leakage as L2s capture fees while the base layer carries security
costs, creating a federal government collecting only state-level tax
revenues, with most blockchain revenue tied to perpetuals, memecoins,
and MEV spikes rather than stable enterprise cash flows.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ETHEREUM'S ECONOMIC AND PRIVACY EDGE OVER BITCOIN (3 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Ethereum's rollup-centric architecture offers privacy without
sacrificing composability, unlike Bitcoin or Zcash, allowing private
interaction with DeFi and financial apps. ETH is also a superior store
of value due to its native staking yield, which stays above net
issuance, eliminating miner-driven sell pressure. Ethereum-based
Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) are therefore structured around ETH as
both a yield-generating and privacy-preserving asset. 

 REVISITING THE HYPEREVM THESIS (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Three months after predicting HyperEVM would become crypto's most
aligned L1, the thesis faces market pressure as TVL dropped $500
million and HYPE fell 13.5% to $38.50 amid industry-wide airdrop
farmer exhaustion following October's Black Friday crash. Native
Markets launched USDH, the first stablecoin using 50% of yield for
HYPE buybacks, while HIP-3 projects like Kinetiq and Ventuals deployed
leveraged equities and pre-IPO markets but struggle with liquidity
despite Robinhood listings and expanding builder code distribution.
The approaching one-year HYPE TGE anniversary brings team unlock
concerns, yet HyperEVM remains crypto's only chain where L1 token,
infrastructure, and builders are economically aligned through
mechanisms impossible elsewhere, like delta-neutral LP strategies
combining AMMs with native perp DEX primitives.

 EIP-7918 TO FIX ETHEREUM'S BLOB PRICING FLAW (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Ethereum's current blob pricing misreads reduced blob usage during
periods of high L1 gas as low demand, making blobs artificially cheap
and causing L2s to halt postings. 

 POLYGON LEADS P2P PAYMENTS WITH 40% MARKET SHARE (1 MINUTE READ) [14]
