MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC SAYS STAKING ACTIVITIES ARE NOT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The SEC clarified in a May 29 staff letter that protocol staking on
PoS blockchains does not constitute a securities transaction, clearing
regulatory uncertainty that had deterred participation and undermined
blockchain decentralization. This enables banks, fintechs, and
custodians to offer staking services without triggering securities
laws, likely accelerating institutional staking, DeFi innovation, and
staking-based ETFs. However, the SEC emphasized that liquid staking
and rehypothecation of staked assets remain ineligible for ETFs, and
custodians must keep staked assets isolated from business operations
or third-party claims. 

 CONSENSYS IN TALKS WITH 'MAJOR SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joe Lubin revealed his firm is
in discussions with sovereign wealth funds and banks from a major
country about building on Ethereum, potentially including Layer-1 and
Layer-2 infrastructure. While no ETH purchases have been confirmed,
Lubin sees growing institutional interest and believes Ethereum is
poised to power a new decentralized financial system, citing ETH's
role as “the gold standard in trust.” The news follows a $425M
ConsenSys-led investment in SharpLink Gaming to establish an
Ethereum-native treasury focused on staking, restaking, and DeFi-based
yield.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 UMA'S AI EXPERIMENT CAN AI AGENTS ENHANCE THE OPTIMISTIC ORACLE? (9
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 UMA has introduced the Optimistic Truth Bot, an AI system that
proposes answers to prediction markets on its Optimistic Oracle. Using
a three-layer agentic architecture (Router, Solvers, and Overseer),
the bot has achieved 78% overall accuracy and 95% accuracy on binary
“yes/no” markets, with top performance in sports and price-based
queries. Though still in testing, the bot could soon propose directly
onchain, helping UMA scale decentralized truth verification while
keeping human oversight intact. 

 TURNKEY INTRODUCES INDEXEDDB (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Turnkey has introduced IndexedDB support for session key management,
offering a secure, persistent, and iframe-free alternative to
LocalStorage and JSON web token (JWT) based setups. Unlike traditional
approaches, session keys stored via IndexedDB are opaque to
JavaScript, maintain resilience across browser events, and eliminate
re-authentication friction, all while improving developer UX with
native signing and streamlined workflows. This upgrade marks a major
step toward more scalable and secure wallet infrastructure for web3
apps.

 AAVE UMBRELLA 101 (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Aave's new Umbrella system replaces the Safety Module, letting users
stake aTokens (like aUSDC or aWETH) to earn yield while directly
backing protocol risk without needing to sell AAVE in a shortfall
event. Rewards adjust dynamically based on staked liquidity targets,
with current APYs reaching up to 12% on stablecoins and 6% on ETH. The
system adds automated slashing, DAO-set buffers, and transparent UI
tools, offering a faster, more efficient safety net for Aave's lending
pools. 

 HOW STABLECOINS BECOME MONEY: LIQUIDITY, SOVEREIGNTY, AND CREDIT (5
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stablecoins are evolving from fast, cheap payments into foundational
financial infrastructure, but to function as true money, they must
integrate seamlessly into the broader monetary system. This requires
solving for 1:1 liquidity, local policy compatibility, and credit
creation challenges, especially as T-bill-backed stablecoins scale.
Innovations like tokenized deposits, decentralized clearing, and
diversified collateral are key to unlocking stablecoins' full
potential without undermining global financial stability.

 THE NEXT NUBANK WILL BE BUILT ON STABLECOINS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Stablecoins aren't just another payments tool, they're becoming the
foundational platform layer for global finance, similar to what Stripe
and BaaS were a decade ago, but on a far larger scale. With regulatory
clarity from the GENIUS Act, stablecoins can now act as cash
equivalents, removing licensing friction, enabling instant global
payments, and powering new fintech primitives. As use cases like
SpaceX treasury ops and Deel global payroll emerge, companies that
treat stablecoins as infrastructure will dominate the next wave of
fintech. 

 ETHEREUM FOUNDATION UNVEILS TREASURY POLICY (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Ethereum Foundation will reduce its annual spending from 15% of
its ~$1 billion ETH treasury to 5% over time, selling ETH via fiat
offramps or onchain swaps as needed to maintain liquidity. Its new
policy emphasizes support for DeFi projects, particularly those
addressing privacy challenges through a “DeFiPunk” framework that
funds privacy-focused research and interfaces.
