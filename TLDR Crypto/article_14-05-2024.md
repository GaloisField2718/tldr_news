 SEC FILING HITS BACK AT COINBASE 'POWER GRAB' ACCUSATIONS (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The SEC has asked the court proceeding over its lawsuit against
Coinbase to reject Coinbase's petition asking for a new regulatory
system for crypto. In March, Coinbase claimed that the SEC does not
have the authority to extend securities rulings to apply to crypto.

crypto as reasonable and within its discretion.

 GOVERNANCE TOKENS ARE JUST MEMECOINS DRESSED IN A SUIT (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Governance tokens and memecoins essentially function the same, as
both lack effective community decision-making power and are primarily
driven by speculative value, often manipulated by VC-backed interests.
The prevailing token distribution models create disparities and hinder
the democratization of financial opportunities in the crypto space.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY BLOCK FOCUSES ON BITCOIN, NOT CRYPTO (30 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Block, the parent company for Cash App and Square created by Twitter
co-founder Jack Dorsey, dedicated its shareholder letter to explaining
why it focuses on Bitcoin instead of crypto and Web3. Block believes
Bitcoin is the best option for the internet's native currency. Its
strategy focuses on making it accessible through Cash App, secure
through creating mining hardware, and usable through mobile on- and
off-ramps. 

 DO USERS CARE ABOUT DECENTRALIZATION? (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Though it may not be explicitly stated, users care about a chain's
safety and liveness. In blockchains with few validators, there are
slim guarantees about uptime or a strong, honest majority. Users have
demonstrated their preference by quickly switching from sidechains and
alt L1s to L2s. Low fees and a great UX are important, but are being
built up to ensure sufficient decentralization for Ethereum.
