 WHAT'S NEXT FOR CHAIN ABSTRACTION (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Even though account abstraction has been pushed for years, there's
been minimal progress towards an ideal user experience. That being
said, cost reductions from L2s and smart contract wallets like Privy
and Coinbase's Smart Wallets are becoming the norm for consumer crypto
apps. Once concepts like MagicSpend++, which allows users to spend
their Coinbase balance directly onchain, become commonplace, the
cost-to-rewards ratio for introducing account abstraction will make
more sense for developers. 

 EIGENLAYER RESEARCH: INTELLIGENT DEFI (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Intelligent DeFi, powered by EigenLayer's Actively Validated
Services, allows for trustless offchain compute and data integration.
This paradigm can solve gas constraints and a lack of real-time
adaptability by utilizing coprocessors for complex computations and
secure data inputs. Potential applications include advanced risk
management, personalized lending, compliant privacy solutions, and
AI-driven yield optimization.
