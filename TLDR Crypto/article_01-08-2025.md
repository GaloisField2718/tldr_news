MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC DEBUTS ‘PROJECT CRYPTO' TO BRING FINANCIAL MARKETS ONCHAIN (8
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The SEC has unveiled “Project Crypto,” a directive to overhaul
outdated securities rules and enable onchain trading of tokenized
assets without unnecessary intermediaries. Chair Paul Atkins framed it
as essential to making the US the “crypto capital of the world,”
emphasizing regulatory updates that prevent driving innovators
offshore and foster super-app ecosystems. Project Crypto builds on the
President's Working Group report, with goals to create a cohesive
framework that integrates blockchain technology into mainstream
financial markets. 

 COINBASE Q2 EARNINGS RESULTS (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Coinbase reported $1.5 billion in Q2 revenue, up from $1.45 billion a
year ago but below the $1.59 billion analysts expected, and saw
adjusted EBITDA fall to $512 million from $596 million. Transaction
revenue plunged 39% quarter-over-quarter to $764 million, despite
Bitcoin and Ether hitting new yearly highs. The stock slid 7% in
after-hours trading as waning trading volumes outpaced overall market
strength. Coinbase highlighted progress in its institutional
infrastructure, staking services, and Base network as strategic growth
drivers beyond its core trading business.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE TO LAUNCH TOKENIZED STOCKS, PREDICTIONS MARKETS (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Coinbase will roll out an onchain “everything exchange” in the
coming months, enabling US users to trade tokenized real-world assets,
including stocks, derivatives, prediction markets, and early-stage
token sales. VP Max Branzburg says this one-stop shop aims to create a
faster, more accessible, and truly global economy by bringing all
asset classes onchain. The move positions Coinbase directly against
Robinhood, Gemini, and Kraken, which already offer tokenized equities
to non-US users. 

 VISA EXPANDS STABLECOIN SETTLEMENT ACROSS 4 BLOCKCHAINS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Visa CEO Ryan McInerney announced multichain, multi-coin stablecoin
settlement support on the Visa network, now spanning 4 blockchains and
4 stablecoins. New additions include EURC (euro-backed), USDG, and
PYUSD via Paxos, along with support for Stellar and Avalanche chains.
This infrastructure enables stablecoin settlement across 25+ fiat
currencies globally, positioning Visa as a key layer for tokenized
money movement across both banks and fintechs.

 THE RISE OF DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY COMPANIES (50 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) now hold over $100 billion
in crypto – 791,000 BTC and 1.3 million ETH – led by Strategy
(MSTR) and several emerging altcoin-focused entrants. They fuel their
treasuries through At-the-Market equity programs and PIPE financings,
creating an “accretive dilution” loop by raising capital at
premiums to NAV and converting it into more digital assets per share.
This model depends on persistently elevated equity premiums, and a
collapse could trigger a rapid unwind, echoing the 1920s investment
trust crashes and potentially pressuring asset prices. Looking ahead,
DATCOs are set to diversify into new tokens, adopt hybrid operating
models, and expand globally, remaining a potent structural source of
buying pressure so long as market and capital-market conditions hold. 

 ETHEREUM 2035: HOW THE NEXT 10 YEARS MIGHT LOOK (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethereum's second decade is expected to transform the network from a
smart contract platform into the foundational “trustware” layer
powering global digital asset digitization, commerce, and identity.
Institutions like GameSquare are accumulating ETH for its
composability and community, while oracle networks and Layer 2s drive
scalability and seamless real-world data integration. The protocol's
evolution will make onchain interactions as invisible as AI-driven
services, embedding Ethereum into enterprise and consumer
applications.

 AAVE EMERGES AS DEFI'S BENCHMARK RATE STANDARD (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Just as SOFR and Fed Funds rates anchor TradFi, DeFi now needs
standardized benchmark rates - and Aave is becoming that foundation.
With $58B in net deposits and over 50% of DeFi lending market share,
Aave's rates reflect true market-wide credit conditions. Protocols
like CoinDesk's Overnight Rates (CDOR), Cap, Level USD, and Plasma
already use Aave's rates to price capital, route idle assets, or set
hurdle yields. Its stability (e.g., only 20bps movement on a $100M
deposit) enables floating-rate lending, structured products, and
institutional risk management. Aave's dominance makes it DeFi's
reference layer for rate discovery, liquidity, and scalability. 

 ZORA TURNS POSTS INTO MARKETS, POWERED BY PRIVY WALLETS (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Zora has evolved from an NFT minting platform into a fully onchain
social app, where every post and profile is a tradable ERC20. Creator
coins pair with $ZORA and generate revenue on every trade (over 1.6M
coins have been created across 200K+ creators, with total trading
volume surpassing $445M). To power this mobile-native UX, Zora uses
Privy to embed self-custodial wallets directly into the app, enabling
users to onboard via content instead of crypto complexity. With over
4M wallets and 2M+ monthly actives, Zora's model blurs the line
between social media and financial protocol, turning followers into
participants and content into capital.
