MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BERMUDA PARTNERS WITH COINBASE AND CIRCLE TO BUILD ONCHAIN ECONOMY (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bermuda is partnering with Coinbase and Circle to pilot stablecoin
payments across government agencies, accelerate USDC adoption among
merchants and banks, and support tokenization and onchain tooling for
local financial institutions while running nationwide digital-finance
education and onboarding. The effort was unveiled at Davos and
described as aspirational and non-exclusive. It builds on prior
onchain pilots (including a USDC airdrop) and coincides with
Coinbase's new Custom Stablecoins product, aiming to lower costs,
speed settlement, and make dollar-denominated digital payments a
practical part of everyday commerce on the island. 

 PORTUGAL ORDERS POLYMARKET BLOCK AFTER ELECTION BETTING SURGE (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Portugal's gaming regulator told prediction market Polymarket to halt
operations after more than €4 million flowed into presidential
election markets in the hours before results, stoking fears that bets
were placed on leaked exit polls. Regulators say Polymarket is
unauthorized and political betting is banned, prompting potential
network-level blocks as the episode adds to a growing list of
jurisdictions (including France, Germany, and recent US state actions)
moving against the platform.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 THE SHAPE OF PREDICTION MARKETS TO COME (19 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Prediction markets are evolving from event speculation into financial
primitives as DFlow tokenizes Kalshi on Solana for DeFi composability,
Gondor enables borrowing against Polymarket ERC-1155 positions via
Morpho vaults at 50% LTV, and Space delivers 10x leveraged exposure
with multi-outcome liquidity unification. AI agents will price thin
micro-markets where human attention is scarce and serve as interface
layers translating plain-English views into optimal cross-platform
exposure across Polymarket, Kalshi, leveraged venues, and perp DEXs.
Impact Markets reveal conditional asset valuations like "BTC price if
Fed cuts 75bp," while Decision Markets automate governance through
futarchy and Opinion Markets trade subjective narratives. Liquidity
remains the binding constraint as most order books are thin with wide
spreads movable 10%+ with thousands of dollars. 

 REVOLUT APPLIES FOR BANKING LICENSE IN PERU (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Revolut has applied for a full banking license in Peru as part of its
Latin American expansion strategy, targeting the country's $4.93
billion annual remittance market, where approximately 1 million people
rely on money sent from abroad. The London-based neobank has seen its
stablecoin payment volumes surge an estimated 156% year-over-year to
approximately $10.5 billion in 2025 following its October 2025
introduction of 1:1 USD conversion for USDC and USDT. Revolut's move
reflects a broader trend across Latin American fintech, with Mercado
Libre launching its Meli Dollar stablecoin in Brazil in August 2024,
Nubank developing dollar-pegged stablecoin credit card payments, and
crypto wallet company Lemon raising $20 million to expand after
issuing over 1 million wallets in Peru in under a year.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ETHEREUM TRANSACTIONS HIT RECORD HIGH AS GAS FEES DROP (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Ethereum daily transactions have surged to 2.1 million, surpassing
2021 cycle peaks with a 14% increase over two weeks, while average gas
fees have dropped to multi-year lows driven by EIP-4844 and recent
blob-capacity upgrades that reduced Layer 2 data posting costs.
Stablecoin transfers make up the majority of network activity, with
Tether's USDT volume roughly double that of Circle's USDC. Validator
dynamics signal strong network confidence as the exit queue fell to
zero from 2.67 million ETH in September. 2.6 million ETH awaits entry
into staking – the highest queue since July 2023 – with
approximately 30% of total ETH supply now staked. 

 STABLECOIN CARD PAYMENTS AT SCALE (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Crypto card payment volumes have surged from $100 million monthly in
early 2023 to over $1.5 billion by late 2025 – a 106% CAGR –
reaching an $18 billion annualized run rate that now rivals
peer-to-peer stablecoin transfers ($19 billion). Visa is leading with
90%+ of on-chain card volume through early infrastructure
partnerships, with its stablecoin-linked card spending alone hitting a
$3.5 billion annualized rate (460% YoY growth). India ($338 billion in
crypto inflows) and Argentina (46.6% USDC share) emerge as global
outliers, with cards serving distinct use cases like crypto-backed
credit in India's UPI-saturated market and inflation hedging via
stablecoin debit in Argentina.

 SKEPTICAL TAKE ON NYSE'S TOKENIZATION PITCH (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The NYSE tokenization announcement is vaporware as it leaves out
critical details like the chain, VM, stablecoins, jurisdictions,
permissioning, and fees used to enable tokenization. The NYSE, a
profit-driven TradFi incumbent backed by regulatory privilege, is
unlikely to successfully execute the radically different,
permissionless architectures tokenization requires. 

 LARGE BITCOIN HOLDERS ACCUMULATE MOST COINS SINCE FTX COLLAPSE (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Fish-to-Shark holders (10-1,000 BTC) accumulated approximately
110,000 BTC over the past 30 days, marking the fastest accumulation
pace since Bitcoin dropped to $15,000 during the November 2022 FTX
collapse. Bitcoin is trading roughly 25% below its October record high
and 15% above its November low of around $80,000, indicating
mid-to-large investors are using the range-bound market to build
positions. Smaller Shrimp holders (under 1 BTC) simultaneously
accumulated over 13,000 BTC, the largest increase since late November
2023, suggesting broad-based accumulation across multiple cohorts.

 HONG KONG ASSET-MANAGER LOBBY PUSHES BACK ON CRYPTO LICENSING (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Professionals Association warned
regulators that proposed virtual-asset management rules, notably
removing the “de minimis” exemption that lets Type 9 managers hold
small crypto allocations without a separate license, would force even
tiny crypto exposures (eg. 1%) to trigger a full virtual-asset
license, imposing heavy compliance costs and deterring traditional
managers from experimenting with the asset class. 

 ETHEREUM SEES RARE MIX OF RISING USAGE AND FALLING FEES (1 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Ethereum is posting a rare efficiency milestone, with 7-day average
transactions nearing 2.5 million, almost double year over year, while
average gas fees have fallen to around $0.15, the lowest in modern ETH
history.

at an average price of about $95,284, bringing total holdings to
709,715 bitcoin as of January 19. 

 SPOT BITCOIN ETFS SEE $1.4 BILLION INFLOWS (3 MINUTE READ) [16]

early October when funds attracted $2.7 billion.
