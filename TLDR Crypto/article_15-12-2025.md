TLDR CRYPTO 2025-12-15

 AI FINANCIALS THAT LOOK LATE STAGE. THE PRICE DOESN'T. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 RAD Intel has 7-figure recurring contracts, sales set to 2x in 2025
[4], a valuation up 5000% in about 5 years, $60M+ raised from 14K+
investors, and a reserved Nasdaq ticker $RADI [4] while still
private. 

Through a qualified Reg A+ offering, SHARES ARE $0.85. That's late
stage style traction at an early stage price. Gaps like this between
performance and price rarely stay open for long.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 DTCC GETS SEC CLEARANCE TO PILOT TOKENIZED SECURITIES (6 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 DTCC received an SEC no-action letter approval for a three-year pilot
program starting H2 2026 to tokenize Russell 1000 stocks, major ETFs,
and US Treasury securities onchain while maintaining identical rights
and protections as original securities. Potential benefits include
collateral mobility, 24/7 trading access, and programmable assets. The
move signals growing acceptance of blockchain in traditional finance,
with over $33 billion in real-world assets now onchain. DeFi protocol
Ondo Finance urged the SEC to delay Nasdaq's tokenization plans until
DTC settlement processes are disclosed publicly to ensure fair
competition and prevent larger institutions from gaining advantages. 

 TERRA'S DO KWON SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS IN PRISON (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Do Kwon received a 15-year prison sentence for his role in Terra's
$50 billion collapse, exceeding prosecutors' 12-year request and
tripling the defense's five-year proposal, which the judge called
"utterly unthinkable and wildly unreasonable." District Judge Paul
Engelmeyer cited the "eye-popping" magnitude of the crime, which
affected hundreds of victims, Kwon's flight to Serbia and Montenegro
on false passports, and "despicable" conduct during UST's de-peg
advising retail to stay invested while insiders exited positions, with
Kwon's trollish Twitter presence particularly galling to the judge.
Kwon pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy and wire fraud after
extradition in Montenegro, reducing the original nine-count
indictment, which carried 135 years maximum, to two counts. He must
serve at least half his sentence before applying for a South Korea
transfer, where additional charges await.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BHUTAN DEBUTS TER GOLD-BACKED TOKEN (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bhutan has launched TER, a Solana-based gold-backed token issued
through Gelephu Mindfulness City with custody by DK Bank, the
kingdom's first licensed digital bank, offering international
investors blockchain-based physical gold ownership with digital
portability. The announcement follows Kyrgyzstan's $50 million USDKG
gold-backed stablecoin launch days earlier, demonstrating a pattern of
smaller nations using blockchain to fuse traditional asset reserves
with regulated digital finance. Gelephu Mindfulness City operates as a
special administrative region using digital assets for financial
reserves and innovation as part of Bhutan's broader blockchain
strategy to diversify its economy. 

 COINBASE INTRODUCES X402 V2 (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Coinbase has released x402 V2, an updated stablecoin-based AI agent
payments protocol that features wallet-based identity, eliminating
per-call repayment, automatic API discovery, dynamic payment
recipients, and multi-chain/fiat support via Chain Agnostic
Improvement Proposals. The modular SDK enables custom networks and
schemes, moving the protocol from "what does it do" to "which services
plug in next" as developers combine payments with secure wallet
access. The update expands on the original open-source x402 protocol
and x402 Bazaar discovery layer released earlier this year,
positioning the system as future-proof infrastructure for unified
payment models between agents and humans.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 FOGO CANCELS $20 MILLION PRE-SALE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Fogo cancelled its $20 million token pre-sale, originally planned for
December 17, instead airdropping the 2% allocation to better
distribute tokens and reward early users ahead of its mainnet launch
on January 13, with 38.98% of supply unlocked. The Solana Virtual
Machine-based Layer 1 adjusted tokenomics to give institutional
investors, Distributed Global and CMS Holdings, 8.77% while burning an
additional 2% from core contributors' genesis allocation, with the
team taking a snapshot of testnet Fogo Fishers and Portal Bridge users
for Fogo Flames points redeemable for tokens. Fogo is the first
blockchain implementing Jump Crypto's Firedancer client. 

 THE INDIAN USDT PREMIUM, EXPLAINED (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The persistent ~6% premium for USDT in India isn't a retail quirk,
it's a shadow exchange rate driven by capital controls and gold
smuggling economics. India legally taxes imported gold at 6%, and
historically, smugglers bypassed this using the hawala system to move
money offshore. Today, hawala has upgraded to USDT as people with
unreported cash buy Tether at a premium in India to pay gold suppliers
abroad, pushing USDT above the RBI-managed INR/USD rate. The premium
tracks the gold duty almost perfectly, as when the tax was 15%, the
USDT premium was ~15% and when the tax dropped to 6%, the premium fell
to ~6%.

 WE NEED TO FIX OUR DEAL WITH BANKS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Consumers have an unfair relationship with banks. People earn almost
nothing on deposits while banks take large risks, keep the upside, and
rely on taxpayer bailouts for the downside. Historically, this was
controlled by Glass-Steagall, which forced banks to separate boring
deposit-taking from speculative investment banking, creating a safer
and more socially aligned system. Deregulation in the 80s–90s
removed those guardrails, letting banks earn huge profits while
lobbying to restrict competition from yield-bearing stablecoins. There
are two paths we may pursue: one is to allow free competition between
banks and stablecoins, or consider bringing back Glass-Steagall to
realign banks with public interest. 

 CRYPTO CARDS AREN'T THE ENDGAME, BUT THEY'RE NOT DEAD EITHER (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Dismissing crypto cards because they're “not the endgame” misses
how infra transitions actually happen, as we won't jump from SWIFT to
self-custodial ZK payments overnight, and cards exist because merchant
acceptance rails haven't moved yet. Commoditizing Cards-as-a-Service
is an accelerant (not a weakness) that pushes differentiation up-stack
into custody, yield routing, tax/FX transparency, UX, and compliance.
Most crypto cards will die, especially in bear markets, but the
winners will be self-custodial, multi-stablecoin native, yield-safe,
low-FX, niche-focused, and genuinely user-first.
