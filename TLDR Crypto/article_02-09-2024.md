MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TRUMP CAMPAIGN CRYPTO DONATIONS OUTPACING ALL OTHER CORPORATE
DONATIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 During Trump's discussion with BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey, he was
promised $100 million in donations and 5 million re-election votes for
promoting pro-crypto policy. Since then, $25 million has been raised.
48% of all corporate money raised this cycle is from crypto.
Pro-crypto money has led to 85% win rates for candidates. More than $4
million in crypto like USDC, ETH, and BTC has been directly donated.
Ripple and Coinbase have been the biggest backers of pro-crypto PACs. 

 SEC WARNS FTX AGAINST PAYING CREDITORS BACK IN STABLECOINS, OTHER
CRYPTO (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The SEC has warned FTX that it may oppose the bankrupt exchange's
plan to repay creditors using stablecoins or other digital assets. The
agency also objects to provisions that would limit future legal
liabilities for FTX's estate, aligning with the U.S. Trustee's
concerns over discharge provisions that protect the debtors from
further claims.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING RUMPEL: TURNING POINTS INTO PROFIT (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Points have become the primary protocol reward mechanism, but users
are frustrated with their lack of transferability. Rumpel wraps points
into a Rumpel Point Token stored in a multisig wallet, allowing points
to be traded onchain. Liquid points markets create more user interest
and speculation, increasing protocol market awareness. 

 EIGENDA: REVOLUTIONIZING ROLLUP ECONOMICS (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 EigenLayer's data availability AVS, EigenDA, has over $9 billion of
restaked capital protecting the availability of rollup data for
transaction verification. Though the DA space is saturated with
competitors, EigenDA has higher throughput and Ethereum alignment but
may not offer as high restaking rewards as other AVSs. EigenDA must
reach $160k monthly revenue, or around 11 rollups, to break even.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW L2S ACTUALLY WORK (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 On an L1, all the network's nodes have to process transactions and
store data onchain, which is an expensive process causing high
transaction fees. L2s use cheaper data and batch transactions together
to be executed by an offchain entity, allowing for hundreds more
transactions per second than L1s. L2s submit transaction proofs
secured by cryptography or staked assets to the L1 for settlement. 

 MOATS IN CRYPTO MARKETS ‚Äì A NEW FRAMEWORK (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In the competitive crypto protocol industry, it is essential to
understand moats and how entrenched specific protocols are. This
framework focuses on six verticals ‚Äî money markets, DEXs,
stablecoins, LSTs, third-party bridges, and social apps ‚Äî and
analyzes them for their defensibility. Each vertical has
‚Äúun-forkable‚Äù properties, like liquidity for a DEX, that keep the
incumbents in power, though some properties are stronger than others.

 GAMING STUDIO ZYNGA SELLS SUGARTOWN TO ITS DEVELOPERS (1 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Zynga, the game studio behind hit games like Farmville and Words With
Friends, has divested from its Web3 game Sugartown. The IP was sold to
D20 Labs, a company led by two Sugartown game developers. A follow-up
post promised more details about the project's future in the coming
weeks. 

 EIGENLAYER: PUSHING BOUNDARIES OF TRUST (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Restaking expands what staked capital can do, while the EIGEN token
and intersubjectivity expand the use cases of governance tokens. The
protocol will have outsized impacts on validator economics, and there
will undoubtedly be unforeseen challenges in the AVS ecosystem. While
complex, restaking could lead to more resilient and responsive
blockchain systems through community-driven resolution of disputes and
expanding decentralized collaboration.
