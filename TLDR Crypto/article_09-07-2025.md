 TRUMP'S TRUTH SOCIAL FILES WITH SEC TO LAUNCH ‘CRYPTO BLUE CHIP' (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Trump's Truth Social has filed with the SEC to launch a “Crypto
Blue Chip” ETF backed by BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and CRO, with initial
allocations weighted 70% to Bitcoin and 15% to Ethereum. The filing,
sponsored by Yorkville America Digital and custodied by Foris DAX
Trust Company, follows earlier applications for spot BTC and BTC+ETH
ETFs. 

 ROBINHOOD ENGAGES WITH REGULATORS OVER TOKENIZED EQUITIES (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Robinhood is in discussions with European regulators, including
Lithuania's central bank, over its new tokenized equities product,
which offers blockchain-based “stock tokens” for firms like OpenAI
and SpaceX. CEO Vlad Tenev clarified that the tokens are
retail-focused derivatives, not actual shares, but regulators are
probing whether the lines between equity and exposure are being
blurred.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 DUELS LAUNCHES FIRST PREDICTION MARKET FOR CONTENT COINS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Built on Farcaster and powered by Base and Doppler, Duels is the
first onchain prediction market for Content Coins (tokens designed to
capture attention, not moonshots). In Duels, creators' tokens battle
for ETH and visibility, gamifying media engagement, and turning it
into tradable value. It's the first step in a broader ecosystem of
interactive, app-powered experiences where real upside accrues to the
app coins driving user participation. 

 JACK DORSEY'S 'BITCHAT' ENABLES BITCOIN OVER BLUETOOTH (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Jack Dorsey has launched Bitchat, a Bluetooth-based messaging app
that works without internet or cellular service. Within an hour of
launch, users began sending Bitcoin over the app's encrypted
peer-to-peer mesh network, turning offline connectivity into a new
frontier for BTC payments.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BEYOND STABLECOINS: THE CASE FOR ETHEREUM (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The explosive growth of stablecoins is an unprecedented opportunity
for Ethereum to host global financial infrastructure, with ETH
positioned to become the reserve asset of this new digital dollar
economy. Ethereum uniquely meets three critical requirements: global
accessibility, institutional safety, and government resistance through
strong decentralization – advantages rooted in its community-funded
origins that competitors cannot easily replicate. As millions of new
stablecoin holders seek yield and financial services that traditional
finance cannot provide due to regulatory constraints, ETH stands to
benefit from a powerful flywheel where increased stablecoin activity
drives ETH demand as collateral, positioning it to capture share from
the $500T legacy store-of-value market while generating 3-5% staking
yields. 

 WHY ROBINHOOD CHOSE ARBITRUM (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Robinhood announced that tokenized stocks will trade on Arbitrum One
and later a custom chain built on Arbitrum's tech stack. The reasons
for this decision include wanting production-ready infrastructure and
easier access from traditional developers via Arbitrum's Stylus
technology. Solana does not allow Robinhood to easily capture value,
which they can do via sequencer fees with an L2.

 ETH ISSUANCE OUTPACED 11X BY ETFS AND PUBLIC FIRMS (2 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Since the Merge, only 298,770 ETH has been issued, yet SharpLink
Gaming and BitDigital alone absorbed ~82% of that in June. Spot ETFs
now hold 4.11M ETH, over 11x net issuance. With burn mechanics,
validator lock-up, and increasing institutional demand, ETH is
behaving like a digital oil field with a daily yield far below market
appetite. 

 RALLY IS JOINING OPENSEA (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenSea has acquired Rally to build an "onchain everything app," with
Rally's founders joining the leadership team and the author becoming
CTO to spearhead a mobile-first strategy launching in 2025. The
combined entity aims to create a platform where tokens and NFTs
complement rather than compete, targeting the 500+ million crypto
holders currently limited to holding on centralized exchanges by
making DeFi, perps, and cross-chain interactions as simple as
traditional banking. This acquisition represents a strategic shift for
OpenSea from competing for NFT market share to growing the entire
onchain audience, with Rally's mobile expertise powering a unified
experience that treats memecoins as cultural movements alongside NFTs.

rails for faster, cheaper, and more transparent settlement.
