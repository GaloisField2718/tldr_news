 HONG KONG'S CENTRAL BANK ISSUES GUIDANCE FOR FIRMS OFFERING CRYPTO
CUSTODIAL SERVICES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hong Kong's central bank has issued guidance for firms looking to
provide digital asset custody services. The guidelines require firms
to undergo comprehensive risk assessment, have adequate resource
allocation for custodial activities, and segregate clients' digital
assets from the firm's own in the event of insolvency. The firms are
also being asked to prevent client asset misuse and minimize the risk
of digital asset loss due to illicit activities. 

 METAMASK MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS NEARS ALL-TIME HIGH ‚Äî OVER 30 MILLION
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Crypto wallet MetaMask saw a 55% increase in active users in the past
four months, from 19 million in September to over 30 million in
January - comparable to the record numbers the wallet hit in 2022. Its
growing user base has coincided with a surge in crypto prices, as more
users return to or find the wallet for the first time. MetaMask has
rolled out Blockaid, a web3 security tool, by default for multiple
blockchains to protect users against malicious transactions.

1.3 million addresses, marking the biggest airdrop of the year so far.

before falling back to $3.50, putting the total supply of 10 billion
tokens at an FDV of $35 billion. Its current market cap is $2.32
billion. The tokens will be progressively unlocked over 31 months
starting from April. This is a faster timeline than what is typical

 WHERE DOES ETHENA‚ÄôS YIELD COME FROM (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ethena Labs rolled out USDe, a trust-minimized scalable stablecoin,
earlier this week. It also released sUSDe, a yield-bearing version
that offers a 27% yield. Ethena generates its returns using yield from
staked Ethereum and financing rates from its short positions, using
staked Ethereum and perpetual contracts to maintain the stablecoin‚Äôs
peg. This means the yield is not without risks.

 AS BITCOIN RALLIES, BANKS ARE PUSHING US REGULATORS TO CHANGE CRYPTO
GUIDANCE (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Major US banking associations have asked the SEC to amend its
definition of crypto assets because they want to be able to serve as
custodians for newly approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. The banks have asked
the SEC to change guidelines issued in March 2022, which make it more
costly for banks to offer large-scale crypto custody services. 

 MICHAEL SAYLOR NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING: ‚ÄòBITCOIN IS THE EXIT
STRATEGY' (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 MicroStrategy's Executive Chairman Michael Saylor declared the
company has no intentions of selling its bitcoin, even though it is
sitting on a nearly $4 billion unrealized profit, as he considers it
to be a superior asset compared to gold, real estate, and the S&P.
Saylor says there is no reason to sell a winning asset. After being
ridiculed throughout the bear market for being underwater on his
purchases, his view has been vindicated by the entrance of
institutional capital into the bitcoin ecosystem via spot ETFs.
