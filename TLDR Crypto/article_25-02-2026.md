 ENERGY GIANTS LIKE EXXON AND CHEVRON HAVE BEEN BUYING UP LAND IN
AMERICA'S LITHIUM HOTSPOT. NOW THEY'VE GOT A NEW NEIGHBOR (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 EnergyX just secured rights to 35,000 acres of lithium-rich land in
Arkansas beside Exxon and Chevron. But land is only part of the story.
EnergyX's patented technology can recover up to 3X more lithium than
traditional methods, positioning it as a leading vertically integrated
U.S. producer. Backed by General Motors, Eni, and POSCO, momentum is
building fast.

With lithium demand projected to 5X by 2040, 40,000+ investors have
already joined. Invest before the price increases after February 26.

 TERRAFORM LABS SUES JANE STREET FOR INSIDER TRADING PRIOR TO TERRA
COLLAPSE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Terraform Labs' liquidation administrator has filed a lawsuit against
Jane Street and several employees, alleging they used non-public
information from Terraform insiders to front-run trades during the
Terra-Luna collapse in 2022 that destroyed over $40 billion in value.
The complaint cites a wallet linked to Jane Street that withdrew 85
million TerraUSD from Curve within 10 minutes of Terraform's
unannounced 150 million withdrawal on May 7, 2022, and claims Jane
Street planted a former Terraform employee to establish insider
communication channels. The lawsuit also connects to the
administrator's filing against Jump Trading for $4 billion in damages
in December, which alleges that Jump leaked information to Jane
Street. Jane Street disputes the claims as "opportunistic." 

 BINANCE DENIES FIRING INVESTIGATORS AFTER REPORTED $1.7B IRAN
TRANSFERS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Binance has disputed reports that it fired investigators who
uncovered roughly $1.7 billion in crypto flows to Iran-linked
entities, saying no one was dismissed for raising compliance concerns.
Its internal review found no sanctions violations, and it has sharply
reduced direct exposure to Iranian exchanges, even as the media
reports allege internal discipline, probe dismantling, and continued
scrutiny after documents tied funds to Iran-linked wallets.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 NEAR LAUNCHES SUPER APP WITH AI CAPABILITIES AND PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NEAR Protocol has launched Near.com, a consumer super app designed
for the agentic era. Its features include AI-driven transaction
automation and a confidential mode for private on-chain activity. The
app simplifies asset management by removing gas fees and private key
complexities for users. 

 MOONPAY LAUNCHES THE ONRAMP FOR THE AGENT ECONOMY (3 MINUTE READ) [8]


 MoonPay Agents is a non-custodial software layer that provides AI
agents with wallets, funding capabilities, and autonomous transaction
execution across the full financial lifecycle – from fiat onramps
through Apple Pay, Venmo, and PayPal to trading, swaps, portfolio
management, and off-ramping. The product features recurring buys to
maintain agent liquidity, x402 protocol support for machine-to-machine
payments, and cross-chain functionality, with humans handling KYC
verification while agents execute transactions autonomously. Built on
MoonPay's infrastructure, which serves nearly 500 companies, the
system is designed to scale from thousands to millions of agents.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 GOLDEN PATH (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto has lost its philosophical purpose by celebrating
institutional adoption while abandoning its core mission of resisting
centralization and preserving individual sovereignty. There are three
possible futures – TradFi absorption, government surrender to
permissionless systems, or an uneasy coexistence as a parallel
walled-off system – with the latter as crypto's "Golden Path." Users
should embrace inconvenience as the cost of sovereignty by
prioritizing algorithmic stablecoins, enabling privacy, and building
censorship-resistant infrastructure that rejects dependence on fiat
ramps and centralized chokepoints. 

 HOW TO FIX TOKENS (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most tokens fail because they incentivize selling over holding, and
one fix is giving token holders direct control over 100% of protocol
revenue through governance votes on distribution versus reinvestment.
This model hasn't been adopted due to insider profitability from token
sales and securities law concerns, but a current regulatory window
with the SEC's Crypto Task Force under Hester Peirce is exploring
registration frameworks and safe harbors. There is urgency for
protocols like Aave, Morpho, and Uniswap already merging equity and
token holders to proactively demonstrate viable models before the
window closes at midterms.

 THE QUIET CRYPTO INTEGRATION (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Blockchain is becoming the foundational infrastructure for fintech,
driven by institutional adoption from BlackRock and Apollo.
Legislation like the CLARITY Act validates this shift. Tokenized money
market funds and stablecoins now provide efficient, 24/7 alternatives
to traditional rails, forcing incumbents to innovate or face
obsolescence. 

 FROM “CRYPTO AI” TO GENERAL: AI AGENTS DREAM OF ELECTRIC
LANGOUSTINES? (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Agentic commerce leverages x402 pay-per-call protocols and ERC-8004
identity registries to enable autonomous machine-to-machine markets.
Frameworks like OpenClaw and DayDreams allow agents to discover, fund,
and provide services using stablecoins. This infrastructure supports
independent micro-businesses.
