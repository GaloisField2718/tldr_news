 SUCLAVE: A NEW AMM DESIGN THAT UTILIZES INTENTS (GITHUB REPO) [7] 

 The $60 billion DeFi market was revolutionized by the UNI V2
protocol, yet it still faces issues linked to volatility and
profiteering bots. This piece discusses these issues and proposes a
solution, SUClave, which utilizes UNI V4 to afford more profitability
to liquidity providers and mitigate the effects of market volatility.
The suggested remedy employs an auction mechanism, leading to greater
profits for liquidity providers and lower fees for users.

 LIBMEV - DATA METHODOLOGIES (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post describes how to dive deep into MEV and transactions on
ETH. With the help of system-specific tools like cryo and reth, the
process is likened to reverse-engineering a puzzle to effectively
identify different types of bundles (independent, backrunning,
frontrunning, and backrunning) and calculate vital information like
ETH tipped, ETH burned, and estimated profit. Moreover, a
post-processing pipeline corrects any potential anomalies, thus
ensuring the reliability of the data.

MINUTE READ) [11]

record-keeping practices and alleged commingling of the company's and
customers' funds. 

 A BASED THESIS (11 MINUTE READ) [12]

simplicity, improved security, and greater economic alignment of based
rollups.
