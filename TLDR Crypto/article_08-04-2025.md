GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 A CRYPTO NARRATIVE WITH PMF (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Despite crypto purists championing trust minimization, real-world
adoption is driven by pragmatic tools like stablecoins that offer
immediate efficiency improvements and capital benefits. Builders
should focus on creating open software ecosystems that bridge capital
with existing financial infrastructure, emphasizing interoperability
and practical impact. Opacity is one of the solutions using zkTLS
technology to unlock new onchain markets using web2 data. 

 ORCHESTRATION IS THE KEY (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Improving “orchestration” (i.e. the ability to execute complex
crypto strategies seamlessly) is the key to making DeFi more
accessible and unlocking broader discovery of opportunities.
Simplifying execution will enable more users to act on their intent
without friction, ultimately driving adoption and growth in the crypto
ecosystem.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MATT HUANG IS A RARE INVESTOR (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Matt Huang is the low-key visionary behind Paradigm, a $12B crypto

 ETHEREUM HAS DISRUPTED ITSELF (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Since EIP-4844, Ethereum L1 fees (including base fees, priority fees,
and MEV tips) have significantly declined as more activity moves to
L2s, with base fees down 99% from their 2021 peak and 92% from the
2022 bear market bottom. This shift reduces validator rewards and
raises issuance, making Ethereum's future value increasingly tied to
the scalability and fee-generating capacity of blobs from L2s, which
could become a bottleneck if transaction volume grows too quickly.
