MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SPOT ETHEREUM ETFS SEE RECORD OUTFLOWS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 US spot Ethereum ETFs saw ~$796M in outflows last week, their worst
since launch in July 2024, as ETH briefly dipped below $4,000 before
rebounding. BlackRock's ETHA lost ~$200M, while Fidelity's FETH shed
~$362M, marking the steepest two-day span of redemptions since
mid-August. Spot Bitcoin ETFs also posted ~$903M in outflows, with
BlackRock's IBIT holding up better than Fidelity's FBTC. 

 NYDIG CALLS FOR BITCOIN TREASURY COMPANIES TO DROP 'MISLEADING' MNAV
METRIC (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 NYDIG's Global Head of Research, Greg Cipolaro, argues that the
commonly used mNAV metric for valuing Digital Asset Treasury companies
should be eliminated from industry reporting, calling it "misleading"
at best and "disingenuous" at worst, following Strive's acquisition of
Semler Scientific in the first-ever DAT merger. The firm criticizes
mNAV for failing to account for operating businesses or other assets
that DATs typically own, noting that most major bitcoin treasury firms
operate value-adding businesses beyond their crypto holdings, while
the metric often uses "assumed shares outstanding" that may include
unconverted debt obligations. NYDIG warns that convertible debt
holders would demand cash rather than shares for their debt, creating
more onerous liabilities than simple share issuance, while convertible
debt structures incentivize DATs to maximize equity volatility since
converts function as debt plus call options.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 A MANIFESTO FOR GENERATIVE ECONOMIES: ELIZAOS REBORN (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Eliza Labs is migrating the ai16z token to elizaOS to support version
2's cross-chain operations through Chainlink's Cross-Chain
Interoperability Protocol and agent-native workflows that learn over
time, evolving from the original ai16z proof-of-concept that
demonstrated agents could capture attention and catalyze culture into
a production framework. elizaOS v2 features 200+ plugins connecting to
various interfaces and cross-chain cognition capabilities, allowing
agents to observe signals on one chain, plan on another, and settle on
a third while maintaining context through CCIP's secure token
transfers and arbitrary data messaging. The framework enables
"generative economies" where tokens behave like programs, treasuries
function as adaptive engines, and strategies improve through
experience, with agents capable of deploying liquidity, allocating
reserves to productive strategies, and routing value efficiently while
sharing learnings across the network. 

 SHARE: THE SOCIAL NETWORK FOR FINANCIAL MARKETS (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Share combines three traditionally separate companies into one native
iOS app: a social network where transactions become content and
wallets become creators, a real-time block explorer indexing every
transaction from onchain apps into human-readable events, and a wallet
for research, trading, and portfolio tracking across Solana, Base, and
Ethereum. Share addresses the observation that many users screenshot
transactions to share on Twitter, Telegram, and Discord despite broken
UX. The platform implements "Info Finance" principles by allowing
wallets to contextualize onchain transactions with media in exchange
for social capital and market influence, creating a real-time feed of
financial market activity as every asset becomes tokenized from stocks
to memes to predictions.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT PREDICTION MARKETS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 a16z crypto's newsletter features a deep-dive on prediction markets
with economics professors Alex Tabarrok and Scott Kominers, exploring
how these markets work, their design principles, and intersection with
AI and futarchy trends, while addressing what prediction markets are
good for and where blockchain technology fits into the ecosystem. The
edition also includes fundraising advice for founders to abandon the
"not-raising-raise" playbook popular during 2020-2021's
zero-interest-rate environment, instead returning to structured,
intentional venture capital pitching processes rather than hoping for
preemption from opportunistic VC meetings. Industry updates highlight
Morgan Stanley's partnership with Zerohash to offer crypto trading on
ETrade in 2026, Coinbase and CloudFlare's x402 protocol foundation for
AI-driven payments enabling direct web transactions without accounts
or API keys, and CloudFlare's new dollar-backed stablecoin for
"instant and secure" agentic web transactions. 

 TETHER AND CIRCLE ARE ‘PRINTING MONEY' BUT COMPETITION IS COMING (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stablecoin giants Tether and Circle are "printing money" by keeping
yields from US Treasuries backing their tokens while holders receive
no returns, with Tether reporting $4.9 billion in net profit in Q2 and
reaching a $500 billion valuation in new funding. New platforms like
M^0 and Agora are emerging to address this issue by allowing
stablecoin infrastructure to route yield directly to applications or
end users rather than issuers capturing all profits, as elevated
interest rates create pressure for yield-sharing models. Tether
defended its approach by stating USDT serves as "a digital dollar, not
an investment product" for hundreds of millions in emerging markets
facing dramatic inflation rates of 50-90% annually, arguing that
yield-bearing stablecoins target different audiences and carry
additional regulatory risks.

 TRUSTWARE, CRYPTO'S TROJAN HORSE FOR PROGRAMMABLE FAIRNESS (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Payments aren't inherently “crypto”, they're just an action made
possible by crypto's trustless settlement. The real breakthrough is
trustware, programmable trust primitives where identity, commitments,
and fairness inherit the same finality and neutrality as onchain
settlement. This creates digital interactions that can't be faked,
revoked, or manipulated by boardrooms or governments. However, if
trustware is built on half-decentralized, corporate rails, it mutates
into a dystopia of permanent surveillance and programmable coercion.
To prevent capture, the rails must be credibly neutral, auditable, and
decentralized from the start, aligning even with the incentives of
those in power, since neutrality protects them from political capture.


 CREDIBLE NEUTRALITY AND WHY ETHEREUM MATTERS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Credible neutrality means anyone, Democrat, Republican, anarchist, EU
bureaucrat, or even a dictator, can trust that their code executes and
property rights are respected without censorship or control. It's the
guarantee of a global, common platform secured by thousands of
independent validators, where you can store a billion dollars
digitally and know it won't be seized. In this framing, Ethereum is
the only Turing-complete platform that won't interfere with your
money, code, or life. That's why, in 20 years, the entire planet will
run on Ethereum, not out of preference, but because it's the only
neutral substrate left.
