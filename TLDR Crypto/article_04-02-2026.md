MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN REBOUNDS ABOVE $78,500 (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin rebounded 4.2% to $78,662 late Monday after falling to
approximately $75,000 earlier in the day, with Ethereum rising 5.86%
to $2,322, though analysts characterized the move as a technical
relief bounce rather than the start of a sustained recovery. Multiple
analysts attributed the rebound to post-liquidation short covering,
oversold conditions, and mechanical correlation with broader risk
assets following an improved ISM print and US equity stabilization,
rather than crypto-specific catalysts or renewed spot-led inflows. The
recent sell-off was triggered by renewed repricing of US interest rate
expectations amid hawkish Federal Reserve signals and uncertainty
surrounding the upcoming Fed chair nomination. If the Warsh-driven
hawkish Fed narrative continues to underpin a firm dollar and elevated
yields, the move is more likely a stabilization bounce than a trend
resumption. 

 WHITE HOUSE WON'T TOLERATE ATTACKS ON THE PRESIDENT IN CRYPTO BILL (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 President Trump's digital assets adviser Patrick Witt said that the
White House has drawn "red lines" against crypto market structure
legislation that targets the president or his family members over
crypto business ties, calling earlier Democratic proposals from
Senator Adam Schiff "completely outrageous" while insisting "this is
not an ethics bill." The standoff over Democrats' demand for
provisions banning top government officials from cashing in on the
crypto industry is holding up the industry's chief policy goal in
Washington, with Democratic lawmakers planning to meet Wednesday to
continue negotiations after a Senate Banking Committee hearing
collapsed on January 14. Separately, Witt led a Monday meeting between
crypto policy experts and banking industry representatives where
digital asset insiders were left frustrated that bankers hadn't
offered solutions on stablecoin yield disagreements, as the White
House attempts to "broker a deal" between banks protecting deposit
businesses and stablecoin product advancement.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 TOKENIZED AGENTS ARE THE NEW META (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The combination of OpenClaw's AI agent builder and Bankrbot's Agent
API has spawned a new category of “Tokenized Agents” - AI entities
that launch their own tokens and fund operations through trading fees,
creating self-sustaining economic models. Moltbook, a social network
for AI agents, exemplifies the trend's momentum with a ~$36M valuation
and $2.35M in fees generated within 24 hours, while leading tokenized
agents like $MOLT and $CLAWD have reached market caps of $40.1M and
$10.9M respectively. 

 A FRESH START FOR TOKENOMICS IN 2026 (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 MegaETH locks 53% of its MEGA supply behind ecosystem KPIs, and
unlocked tokens distribute to longest-term stakers rather than teams.
Cap's “Stabledrop” distributes cUSD stablecoins to point farmers
instead of governance tokens, requiring actual investment through a
Uniswap CCA sale to acquire CAP and filter for committed holders. It
is a departure from spray-and-pray token emissions toward equity-like
structures that optimize for holder quality over distribution breadth.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 APPLICATION-CONTROLLED EXECUTION: A CASE STUDY ON CANCEL
PRIORITIZATION (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Application-controlled execution (ACE) grants decentralized
applications control over transaction sequencing. Hyperliquid
demonstrates this through cancel prioritization, significantly
improving onchain trading performance. The study evaluates four
implementation mechanisms, highlighting how ACE optimizes execution
environments to benefit liquidity providers and reduce toxic flow. 

 THE FALSE GOLD-TO-BITCOIN NARRATIVE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Coinbase Institutional's quantitative analysis challenges the popular
“capital rotation from gold to bitcoin” narrative following gold
and silver's collapse after Kevin Warsh's Fed Chair nomination. The
research scanned correlation patterns across weekly to annual
timeframes and found no statistically robust relationship between gold
bull trends and subsequent bitcoin rallies. Gold functions primarily
as a momentum trade rather than a debasement hedge, undermining the
theoretical basis for why stronger gold performance should predict
bitcoin strength.

 EXPERTS DEBATE VITALIK BUTERIN'S CREATOR COIN VISION (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Vitalik Buterin has proposed shifting creator coins from speculation
to quality discovery using curated DAOs and prediction markets. While
supporters highlight improved incentive alignment, critics argue that
DAO governance capture and subjective creative standards may undermine
the effectiveness of these financial primitives in SocialFi. 

 WHY MORPHO PAYS MORE THAN AAVE (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Morpho's blue-chip USDC vaults have consistently delivered a ~150bps
spread over Aave's USDC supply rate. Collateral optionality only
explains part of it, while user composition (fewer protocols and more
institutional/fintech partners on Morpho), concentrated liquidity, and
differing market structure/partnership channels appear to drive the
premium, though spreads have been shrinking as allocators grow
comfortable with vault abstractions.
