 USING VALUABLE TOKENS FOR TRANSACTIONS IS A BROKEN MODEL (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Tokens on traditional blockchains are capital with fluctuating value,
but they're also used for transaction and operational fees. This makes
costs unpredictable, creates volatile markets for digital assets, and
limits liquidity.

The Midnight network [4] separates the governance and capital from
operational costs using a dual-component model. Here's how it works:

→ NIGHT [4] is the public and transparent token used for governance
and incentives.

→ NIGHT then generates DUST, a shielded resource which powers the
transactions on the network.

→ DApp operators get predictable operational costs and can offset
fees for their users by holding enough NIGHT,

NIGHT is now listed on major exchanges. Learn more [4]

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BINANCE LET $1.7B FLOW THROUGH TERROR-LINKED ACCOUNTS (4 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Binance processed $1.7 billion through suspicious accounts, including
$144 million after its November 2023 $4.3 billion settlement, with 13
flagged accounts receiving $29 million from wallets later frozen by
Israel and sanctioned by the US for Hizbollah and Iran connections.
One Venezuelan account moved $93 million from terror-linked networks
while another changed bank details 647 times in 14 months across 496
unique accounts, with physically impossible login patterns going
undetected despite two independent monitors appointed in May 2024.
Trump's October pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao loosened the
compliance environment, as the Trump family expanded business ties
through World Liberty Financial's massive USD1 stablecoin rollout on
Binance. 

 GHANA LEGALIZES CRYPTO TRADING, PLANS TO EXPLORE GOLD-BACKED
STABLECOINS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ghana's parliament has passed the Virtual Asset Service Providers
Bill, legalizing crypto trading and requiring digital-asset
participants to register with the Bank of Ghana or the SEC, depending
on activity type. Ghana also signaled a 2026 focus on payments and FX
settlement and will explore asset-backed digital settlement
instruments, including gold-backed stablecoins.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE TO ACQUIRE THE CLEARING COMPANY (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Coinbase has entered into an agreement to acquire The Clearing
Company. The acquisition adds specialized talent powering regulated
onchain markets alongside the platform's existing crypto, derivatives,
and equities offerings, expected to serve millions trading real-world
event outcomes. The transaction is subject to customary closing
conditions, with completion expected in January. Coinbase positions
prediction markets as a natural fit for its unified asset class
trading vision. 

 TEMPO TO LAUNCH SUBSCRIPTIONS VIA ACCESS KEYS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tempo is prototyping subscription payments using access keys. After a
user signs up and funds the account, they approve a recurring charge
(demo'd as once-per-minute to mimic monthly billing) that continues
until the user cancels. A screenshot in the thread shows the full
flow: 1. create account, 2. add testnet funds, 3. Approve, 4.
recurring charges, 5. cancel.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 CREATOR COINS ARE FAILING FOR A REASON NO ONE WANTS TO ADMIT (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Creator Coins on Zora and Base are failing because platforms frame
them as investment opportunities through trading contests and
"green/red" categories rather than fan support tools, creating
pump-and-dump cycles where early snipers and bots profit while late
participants absorb losses, destroying community trust. Most creators
lack audiences that sustain ongoing demand beyond initial Jesse Pollak
amplification and platform features, with trading fees peaking in
hours then vanishing as prices fall when temporary attention fades.
Web2's sustainable model shows fans spending on merch, donations, and
virtual gifts without profit expectations, suggesting Creator Coins
should function as loyalty tokens and Content Coins as onchain tip
jars where value flows from appreciation, not speculation. 

 STATE OF FINTECH 2026 (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Fintech hyperscalers Nubank, Klarna, and Revolut reached 127 million,
114 million, and 65 million customers, respectively, as the sector
bifurcated between neobanks targeting mass affluent, stablecoins
attacking corporate cross-border rails, and AI unbundling asset
manager workflows, though only Stripe deployed industry-specific
foundation models driving earnings despite AI assisting one in six
Black Friday purchases. Banks posted record years through M&A
tailwinds as prediction markets had their breakout with Wall Street
making strategic bets, positioning platforms as price discovery rather
than gambling. Financial nihilism emerged as a political force as
consumers abandoned 60/40 portfolio retirement belief due to housing
costs breaking the social contract, while open finance quietly
succeeded as cash flow data was integrated into Experian and FICO
scoring.

 AAVE LABS BRAND ACQUISITION PROPOSAL (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Aave Labs advanced a brand-rights proposal to Snapshot vote without
author Ernesto Boado's consent, prompting accusations of a "hostile
takeover attempt" from Marc Zeller, who criticized the holiday timing
and recent wave of new delegations with sizable voting power. Boado
called the action "disgraceful" and urged abstention as the proposal
seeks to give AAVE token holders explicit control of domains, social
handles, GitHub organizations, and naming rights currently stewarded
by Aave Labs and BGD Labs. Aave Labs defended the move as following
documented governance rules requiring a five-day ARFC minimum before
voting, arguing prolonged debate was "hurting the Aave brand" and
critics were trying to rewrite rules because they lacked votes. The
dispute escalated earlier tensions over CoW Swap revenue allegedly
diverted from the DAO treasury and a "poison pill" proposal suggesting
the DAO absorb Aave Labs entirely, as the AAVE token slumped over 10%
in 24 hours. 

 12 PREDICTIONS FOR 2026 (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 2026 will be defined by AI agents becoming “more expensive than
people” in business, a major liquidity/IPO + M&A comeback, and the
stack evolving toward long-horizon autonomous agents (8+ hour
workstreams), agent observability, and agent-driven database stress.
On crypto, 30% of international payments will be issued via
stablecoins by December, and Cloudflare will become a gatekeeper for
agentic payments via the x402/HTTP 402 Payment Required pattern.
