MARKETS & BUSINESS

 LEAKED CHAINALYSIS VIDEO SUGGESTS MONERO TRANSACTIONS MAY BE
TRACEABLE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A leaked video suggests that Chainalysis may have found ways to trace
Monero (XMR) transactions and identify associated IP addresses,
raising concerns about the privacy claims of the cryptocurrency. While
Monero's team has not yet commented, some see the firm's efforts as
potentially helping to improve the blockchain's security. 

 TON HITS RECORD TRANSACTION HIGHS POST-DUROV ARREST WHILE TOKEN PRICE
PLUMMETS 30% (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The TON network saw a sharp rise in activity following Telegram
founder Pavel Durov's arrest, with daily transactions spiking by over
160% and active addresses hitting record highs. Despite this surge in
usage, the TON token's price has plummeted by 30%, likely influenced
by both the arrest and broader market conditions.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 RABBY INTRODUCES GAS ACCOUNTS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Rabby has launched "GasAccount", a mechanism that simplifies gas fee
payments by allowing users to deposit USDT/USDC and automatically pay
for gas on any network without holding gas tokens in their addresses.
Transactions are processed in seconds with gas fees pre-estimated and
charged in USD, with any unused gas remaining in the user's address
without additional charges beyond a small transaction fee.

up to 8% cash back on transactions. The card is accepted wherever VISA

conference for certain cardholders. It promises a blend of efficient,
cost-effective onchain and real-world utility.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BLOCKCHAINS AS A NEW MEDIUM FOR ENTERTAINMENT (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Blockchains have successfully created organic communities and
cultures. Though some are purely driven by financial motives, the
drama and sense of belonging cannot be overstated, with Ethereum and
other chains providing a sense of social alignment. Blockchains are
blank canvases for all of society's activities. 

 HOW TO APPROACH THE KOREAN MARKET (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To effectively penetrate the Korean market, crypto projects should
try to use the vast trading volume from Korea's major CEXs and engage
with local media, advisory, and consulting firms. Tailoring marketing
strategies to align with local preferences and trends and respecting
the nuanced understanding of Korean investors, is crucial for
establishing a strong presence.

 DECENTRALIZED ENERGY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), which aggregate and coordinate
small-scale energy resources across homes and businesses, are emerging
as a potential solution to bridge the growing energy supply-demand gap
in the US and China. Though they have enormous potential and
government support, the market remains nascent, with current projects
connecting less than 0.25% of US households. Crypto-enabled DePIN
solutions could accelerate adoption with network effects and
incentivize participation. 

 ETHEREUM'S VALUE ACCRUAL EXPLAINED (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 EF researcher Justin Drake sees the value accrual thesis for ETH as
‚ÄúETH is money.‚Äù He argues it cannot be the settlement layer of the
internet without becoming programmable money, and needs to grow to
tens of trillions of dollars to provide economic bandwidth, security,
and salience. The important metric is not fees but the percentage of
ETH used as collateral money.
