MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN'S BOTTOM SLOWLY ERODES AS WHALE WALLETS INCREASE BY 3% (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The number of Bitcoin wallets containing large amounts (1,000+ BTC)
has grown by 3.5%, and very small amounts (0.0001 BTC or less) by ~75%
over the last year. Meanwhile, wallets with medium amounts of BTC
(1-10 BTC) have decreased, indicating a redistribution of holdings
across both extremes of the wealth spectrum. 

 BANKROLL NETWORK DEFI HACKED (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A hacker reportedly drained $230K from the DeFi protocol Bankroll
Network by exploiting a vulnerability, potentially using flash loans
for initial deposits. This incident involved large transfers between
contracts and accounts. Investigations are continuing. The incident
highlights the need for diligent protocol security checks by users.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SINGAPORE'S DBS BANK LAUNCHING CRYPTO STRUCTURED PRODUCTS (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 DBS Bank has launched crypto-structured products, including
structured notes and options with underlying Bitcoin and Ethereum
reserves, after an initial announcement on September 17. They started
trading yesterday. 

 ARBITRUM'S TIMEBOOST AUCTION (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Arbitrum DAO recently approved a new sequencing policy called
Timeboost, which replaces the first-come-first-serve approach with an
auction. Every minute, a winner gets a 200ms advantage for including
transactions in blocks, allowing them to capture MEV. Potential risks
exist, like incentivizing transaction spamming and MEV going to
searchers instead of apps, yet the proposal passed with a heavy
majority.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 TOP DEFI NEWS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS WEEK (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many projects, including WalletConnect, EtherFi, EigenLayer, and
LayerZero, have announced additional or primary token distributions.
Infrastructure improvements like Polkadot's Agile Coretime and Flare's
Time Series Oracle v2 allow for more sophisticated applications and
increased scalability. The Re Member Fund has introduced reinsurance
products to the Avalanche blockchain. 

 AIRDROPS FOR FARM IN Q4 2024 (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Recent airdrops have been disappointing and overfarmed. This post
compiles some remaining promising projects for the last quarter of
2024. New campaigns are shifting towards more diverse and
engagement-focused distribution strategies, with projects like Morpho,
Sunrise, and Mantle showing promise. The estimated fair value at
launch for these projects ranges from $150M to $1B, indicating less
market interest than earlier in the year and a varied scale of
protocols entering the market. 

 AN OVERVIEW OF RONIN, THE GAMING L2 (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ronin, once hit by a devastating $600 million hack, managed to turn
its crisis into a comeback by swiftly improving security, raising
$150M for recovery, and expanding beyond its original game, Axie
Infinity. It is now a leading Layer-2 platform in Web3 gaming,
demonstrating the value of resilience and innovation in the crypto
space.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SILVERGATE'S SHUTTERING CAUSED BY â€˜INTENSE REGULATORY PRESSURE' (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Silvergate Bank's closure was driven primarily by intense regulatory
pressure rather than a failure to handle bank runs post-FTX. The
federal bank regulatory agencies shifted their stance to become more
intolerant of banks heavily involved with digital asset customers.
This pressure undermined Silvergate's business model, which
prioritized digital assets, leading to its eventual bankruptcy despite
the bank's ability to manage a bank run and meet its financial
obligations. 

 DRAKULA'S THREE BETS (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 TikTok-style SocialFi app Drakula is making three bets for its next
onchain app. First, it is all-in on Base, since it has low fees,
massive distribution, and good developer tooling via OnchainKit and
the Smart Wallet. Second, it is making crypto invisible by using
Passkeys and email sign-in. Finally, it wants to make the UX as good
as TikTok and compete with existing web2 players. 

 THE AUTONOMOUS WORLDS SCENE IS DEAD (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Autonomous Worlds concept of creating immersive onchain worlds
was dead before it had a chance to prosper. Lattice's Redstone gaming
L2's initial apps have already shut down or died off. There are only a
few companies building in Lattice's ecosystem, but the narrative may
live on in other ways.
