 PRIVACY IS THE UNLOCK FOR BROADER WEB3 ADOPTION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The transparency of traditional blockchains forces a difficult
choice: utility or privacy. While transparency can build trust, it can
also expose user activity and personal data. Midnight [4] empowers
innovators to break free from this limitation, to a place where
privacy is not just a feature, but foundational.

Midnight is a fourth-generation blockchain redefining onchain privacy
with a novel token economic model and programmable privacy with
selective disclosure. Meaning a better experience where users and
developers can control their own data.

Privacy matters. If it matters to you...

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TORRES TARGETS PREDICTION-MARKET “INSIDER TRADING” AFTER MADURO
TRADE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Rep. Ritchie Torres plans to introduce the Public Integrity in
Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026, which would bar federal
elected officials, political appointees, and executive-branch
employees from trading prediction contracts tied to government policy
or political outcomes when they possess (or could reasonably obtain)
material nonpublic information through their jobs. The push follows
scrutiny around a newly created Polymarket account that reportedly
turned ~$32.5K into over $400K by betting on Venezuelan President
Nicolás Maduro being “out” by January 31, shortly before news
broke that US forces had captured him. 

 SPOT CRYPTO ETF TRADING VOLUME TOPS $2T, PACE ACCELERATES INTO 2026
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 US spot crypto ETFs crossed $2 trillion in cumulative trading volume
on January 2, reaching the second trillion in roughly 8 months (about
half the time it took to hit the first trillion after spot Bitcoin
ETFs launched in January 2024). The increase comes as the product set
broadened beyond BTC and ETH following faster SEC listing standards,
with new spot ETFs tied to assets like Solana, XRP, Dogecoin,
Litecoin, Hedera, and Chainlink.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHEREUM 2026: THE REBELLION (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ethereum's 2025 achievements included increased gas limits, blob
count, node software quality, zkEVM performance milestones, and
PeerDAS. In this thread, Vitalik Buterin lays out what needs to be
done going forward to make it the world's blockchain. The mission is
to build a world computer serving as infrastructure for a free, open
internet with decentralized apps that run without fraud, censorship,
or third-party interference. Ethereum is “the rebellion” against
subscription services and centralized overlords. To achieve this lofty
vision, it needs to be usable at scale and actually decentralized at
both blockchain and application layers. 

 WHITE-LABEL STABLECOINS ARE THE NEXT STEP AFTER 2025'S YIELD-BEARING
BOOM (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Yield-bearing stablecoins (YBS) took off in 2025, with supply growth
led by products like sUSDS and syrupUSDC, while sUSDe contracted. The
next competitive move is owning the stablecoin layer. Instead of
outsourcing issuance economics to Circle or Tether, chains and apps
are increasingly choosing white-label or multi-issuer models so they
can keep more of the fees and Treasury yield. Ethena has evolved from
a single YBS product into a broader “stablecoin layer” across
ecosystems, and M0 is positioning itself as an issuance platform where
many issuers can launch branded “crypto dollars” with customizable
rules for compliance and yield-sharing helped by shared liquidity and
easier swapping across M0-issued stables.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 CT IS WRONG ABOUT CONTENT COINS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CT misunderstands content tokenization – Base's vision is sound,
but communications are naive. Critics attack the model as a dead-end
while pointing to Nick Shirley's ~$6K earnings as failure, but napkin
math shows this aligns with X's ~$0.046 user-side CPM. Most content
naturally concludes engagement in 24-48 hours per social media
dynamics, not “pump and dump” mechanics. Content coins face
securities classification risks pre-Clarity Act, but Base is
disintermediating one of the fastest-growing marketplaces, and CT
needs a pragmatic lens. 

 10 WAYS BASE COULD COURSE CORRECT (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Base should rebalance away from creator economy overemphasis toward
general-purpose onchain infrastructure by separating comms strategies,
transforming Base App into an app-discovery platform, and addressing
poor onboarding UX that drops new users into PvP trading environments.
Suggestions include bringing more founders onto the Base team,
re-centering around ownership-based products rather than speculative
trading, and exploring the BASE token as currency to align builder
incentives.

 SIGNAL VS. NOISE: TRADFI EDITION (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 TradFi incumbents' onchain strategies contraindicate crypto's likely
future – the more large intermediaries embrace a vision, the less
viable it becomes. Large exchanges and banks derive trillions in
market cap from monopolistic positions in finance plumbing with
regulatory moats that have never faced real competition. Crypto
represents a second, independent system aimed at restructuring finance
so that critical infrastructure is owned by no one but accessible to
everyone. TradFi migration reflects self-preservation incentives, not
the revealed truth about decentralized architecture. 

 2026 STATE OF CRYPTO (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Total crypto market cap sits at $3.1T (down 14% YoY) with easy money
stopping in 2025 as VC pump-and-dumps, memecoins, and DATs all fell
flat. For the first time, products not relying on token speculation
outperformed – Polymarket and stablecoins saw usage surge while
market cap declined. Though token prices are down since snakeoil
salesmen oversell narratives, the macro trend of declining
institutional trust makes credibly neutral money a $100T+ opportunity
with only BTC and ETH qualifying.
