crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw $2.2B in inflows last week,
with Bitcoin ETPs contributing $1.9B and total crypto ETP assets under
management reaching a record $171B. While BlackRock's iShares ETFs

 BITCOIN SURGES TO $109K, HITS RECORD HIGH AHEAD OF DONALD TRUMP'S
INAUGURATION (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $109,333 ahead of Trump's
inauguration, with the price surge following Trump's Sunday speech,
which highlighted crypto performance and his campaign promises to
establish a strategic national Bitcoin reserve. BTC briefly dipped
below $100,000 following the launch of Melania Trump's memecoin but
quickly recovered. Its market dominance approached 60% with a record
$1.75 trillion market cap differential over Ethereum. Some experts are
anticipating this rally to continue as Trump's pro-crypto policies are
implemented.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INFINITY POOLS: UNLIMITED LEVERAGE ON ANY ASSET WITH NO LIQUIDATIONS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 InfinityPools has launched on Base. It introduces a novel approach to
leverage trading that eliminates liquidations by borrowing
concentrated AMM liquidity to create built-in downside protection.
InfinityPools allows for theoretically unlimited leverage by treating
concentrated liquidity positions as implicit put options at the
liquidation price, allowing traders to maintain positions regardless
of price movements while paying ongoing interest. It aims to generate
better yields for liquidity providers through continuous borrowing of
out-of-range liquidity to protect levered positions. 

 VITALIK BUTERIN ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO THE ETHEREUM FOUNDATION (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is undergoing a leadership restructuring
to improve technical expertise, ecosystem communications, and faster
execution while maintaining its commitment to user privacy and
censorship resistance. The foundation explicitly rejects becoming a
lobbying organization or centralized power and wants to remain neutral
for both individual and institutional users. The EF has previously
faced criticism for not taking a more proactive stance toward
promoting ETH and the ecosystem, especially as Solana continues to
gain momentum and adoption.

 TOP 10 DELPHI PREDICTIONS FOR 2025 (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Delphi Digital predicts Bitcoin's bull run will continue based on
monthly RSI patterns and institutional interest and that Solana will
continue to outperform Ethereum due to superior UX and SVM adoption.
The analysis anticipates major shifts in multiple sectors: NFTs
resurging through tokenization of real-world assets, DeFi evolving
into DeAI with automated capital allocation, and agents becoming major
market players. The report highlights technological developments
expected to drive 2025 growth, including zkVM adoption improving
cross-chain interoperability, high-throughput chains like Hyperliquid
and Sui enabling new experimentation, and consumer DeFi expansion
through zkTLS technology enabling private onchain data integration. 

 WHY ROLLUPS LOSE TO SOLANA (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post critiques the scalability challenges of Ethereum rollups
compared to high-performance blockchains like Solana and "Based
rollups," arguing that rollups are inherently limited by Ethereum's
upgrade pace. It emphasizes Solana's superior throughput trajectory,
including innovations like Firedancer, and contends that Ethereum
scaling will require more aggressive and riskier trade-offs to compete
effectively in the global demand landscape.

 DISPELLING FALSE RUMORS, A POST IN SUPPORT OF ETHEREUM (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This thread addresses common critiques of the Ethereum Foundation
(EF), debunking myths about its engagement, use of the chain, funding
practices, and transparency. It highlights EF's initiatives, like
staking ETH to fund clients, using Ethereum for grants and events, and
supporting core developers, while emphasizing the need for
constructive dialogue and collaboration within the community. 

 SOLANA STILL UNDER PRESSURE AFTER TRUMP MEMECOIN LAUNCHES (1 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Solana is under heavy pressure from TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins,
which are causing transaction fees to spike and failure rates to
double to 40% despite low compute unit utilization. This highlights
scalability challenges, likely because of network bandwidth
bottlenecks and overestimated app resource needs, with block
propagation and signing also affected.
