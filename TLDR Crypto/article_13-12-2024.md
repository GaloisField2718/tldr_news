MARKETS & BUSINESS

 GRAYSCALE LAUNCHES LIDO, OPTIMISM INVESTMENT FUNDS (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Grayscale Investments has launched two new single-asset funds for
Lido's LDO and Optimism's OP tokens, offering exposure to Ethereum's
largest liquid staking protocol (LDO) and a popular layer-2 scaling
solution (OP). This expansion adds to Grayscale's growing suite of
crypto investment products, highlighting its focus on protocols that
improve Ethereum's scalability, security, and adoption within the DeFi
ecosystem. 

 ETHEREUM HEADED TO $5K AS ACTIVITY, INSTITUTIONAL DEMAND GROWS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Crypto analysts predict Ethereum could reach $5,000, driven by strong
institutional demand evidenced by $2 billion in cumulative ETF inflows
and increased network activity averaging 6.5-7.5 million daily
transactions. The analysts point to bullish fundamentals including
growing ETH burns since September, total value locked reaching $77
billion (led by Lido, Aave, and EigenLayer), and renewed market
optimism following the U.S. presidential election results, with
Trump's potential crypto-friendly policies sparking hopes for a DeFi
sector revival.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ROYCO MAINNET BETA IS LIVE (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Royco Protocol has introduced a new DeFi primitive called
Incentivized Action Markets (IAMs), designed to create efficient
markets for onchain transactions by allowing anyone to offer and
negotiate incentives for specific blockchain actions. The protocol
addresses current inefficiencies in token incentive distributions,
citing examples like Ethereum's $4B+ staking rewards and EigenLayer's
15% token distribution, by enabling price discovery and broader market
participation. Various lending markets have already released Royco
vaults on Base, Arbitrum, and Ethereum. 

 COW SWAP LAUNCHING ON BASE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 CoW DAO has launched its main product, CoW Swap, on Base, bringing
gasless trading, MEV protection, and advanced order types to Base
users while seamlessly integrating with its existing ecosystem. This
deployment positions CoW DAO as a foundational player in Base's
growing ecosystem and sets the stage for further innovations like CoW
AMM, improving the DeFi experience for both traders and developers.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 PRIMER ON ETH GAS LIMIT RAISE (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Ethereum gas limit is directly controlled by validators, who vote
with each block to raise or lower it, bypassing the formal EIP
process. Recently, core developers signaled support for raising the
limit to 36m gas as a safe first step, with client updates
facilitating the change, but there is frustration over the small
increase and discussion about implementing more dynamic, scalable
adjustments in the future. 

 6TH ANNUAL CRYPTO DEVELOPER REPORT (28 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Electric Capital Developer Report reveals shifts in patterns in
2024 with global monthly active developers down 7% to 23,613 and
showing major geographic redistribution as Asia became the leading
continent for crypto development, surpassing North America and Europe.
The report highlights substantial growth in Ethereum Layer 2
development, with over half of Ethereum's developers now working on L2
solutions, while Solana emerged as the leading platform for new
developers in 2024. Notable trends include record-breaking crypto ETF
inflows exceeding $50B, all-time high stablecoin usage at $196B in
circulation, and significant growth in NFT deployments and DeFi
activity, particularly in restaking and liquid staking derivatives.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE ODOS DAO LAUNCH (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Odos DAO has officially launched, marking a shift towards
decentralized governance and unveiling a Tokenized Loyalty Program set
to begin on December 20. The initiative combines user rewards through
$ODOS tokens with community-driven decision-making, positioning Odos
at the forefront of decentralized finance's growth. 

 THE CYPHERPUNK ENDGAME & REAL WORLD ETHEREUM (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ethereum is shifting from speculative cycles to sustainable adoption
patterns with a focus on real-world utility through stablecoins and
traditional finance integration. This author predicts significant
involvement from traditional financial institutions but warns of
potential compromises to crypto's core values of permissionlessness
and decentralization, drawing parallels to how other revolutionary
technologies like file sharing and encrypted messaging evolved. The
essay emphasizes the importance of preserving user freedoms within
custodial solutions while acknowledging that mass adoption will likely
come through more centralized, user-friendly applications.
