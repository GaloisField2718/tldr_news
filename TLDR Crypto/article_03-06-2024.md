MARKETS & BUSINESS

 US BANKING LOBBY TO TRY AND OVERTURN BIDEN VETO ON SAB 121 (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Just hours before President Joe Biden vetoed the repeal of Staff
Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, the American Bankers Association (ABA)
made a last-ditch effort to influence his decision, arguing that the
regulations hinder banks' ability to effectively safeguard digital
assets, which could harm investors and destabilize the financial
system. Despite bipartisan Congressional support for the repeal, Biden
used his presidential veto. The ABA claims that SAB 121 deviates from
traditional custodial asset treatment and limits secure options for
customers holding digital assets. 

 MATTER LABS DROPS 'ZK' TRADEMARK APPLICATIONS FOLLOWING BACKLASH FROM
LEADING PROJECTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Matter Labs, the company behind the zkSync L2, has dropped its
trademark application for the term ‚ÄúZK‚Äù after receiving backlash
from StarkNet, Polygon, and the zero-knowledge proof co-inventors. It
had previously supported a community proposal to set up an ownerless
legal entity to hold the trademark and issue free licenses to all
applicants.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BOLT ‚Äì ENABLING TRUSTLESS PRE-CONFIRMATIONS ON ETHEREUM (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Bolt aims to enable near-instant transaction confirmation by allowing
block proposers to commit to their block contents before their slot.
The trustless, permissionless protocol uses restaked collateral to
back validator promises, allowing them to further monetize blockspace.


 ETHEREUM'S UX IMPROVEMENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 It is possible to securely onboard to an L2 in a few minutes with
Venmo and zkp2p. Tools like Coinbase's Smart Wallet can abstract away
complexities from wallet creation. EIP-7702, slated for inclusion in
the next hard fork, will introduce gas sponsorship, custom
verification logic enabling 2FA, and additional security features like
spending limits. Stealth addresses in ERC-5564 will enable
banking-level privacy for transactions.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 COINBASE SMART WALLET 101 (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Coinbase's new smart wallet uses Account Abstraction (AA) and
passkeys to allow users to create and manage a crypto wallet via Touch
ID without traditional passwords or Chrome extensions. The wallet uses
AA to execute transactions fully sponsored by Base (thus effectively
free), making it easier for users to engage with crypto securely and
efficiently with biometric authentication using a quick and simple UX.


 THOUGHTS ON POLYGON MIDEN (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Miden uses the actor model design, a form of concurrent computation,
to introduce local state change management and faster transaction
processing. Zero knowledge proofs validate locally-executed
transactions, meaning that transactions can be private. Miden's goal
is to support privacy-oriented use cases as a ZK L2 with smart
contracts programmed in TypeScript and Rust.

 CHANGING ADVERTISING ON FARCASTER (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A new ad model on Farcaster could use open social graphs, embedded
payment rails, and verifiable digital identities to give companies the
ability to directly send targeted coupons to consumers' wallets. This
approach would ensure that ad budgets are only spent when a sale gets
converted, potentially improving marketing campaign ROI while
maintaining access to consistent, open data. 

 SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE BITCOIN BLOCK SIZE WAR (20 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Vitalik Buterin comments on the different perspectives on the big
block versus small block debate and what we can learn from them. Small
blockers saw Bitcoin as a conservative chain that should only hard
fork in rare cases that was trying to be a new currency, not a payment
processor. Big blockers saw BTC as digital cash and thus wanted fees
to be low, seeing the pivot to digital gold as a decision made by a
small group of developers to profit off L2s. Ethereum learned from
Bitcoin's shortcomings to create a more resilient chain.
