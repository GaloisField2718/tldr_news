 BITCOIN FALLS 8%, DROPS BELOW $62K BEFORE REBOUND (2 MINUTE READ) [3]


 The cryptocurrency market sharply declined over the weekend, with the
broader market falling around 10% on Saturday. Though there is no
concrete reason for this drop, some popular reasons include dropping
liquidity because of tax payments due on April 15th and the Iranian
drone strikes against Israel. The market recovered slightly after
Iran's Permanent Mission to the United Nations said its strikes were
concluded. 

 $256M LIQUIDATED IN LONG POSITIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 $256 million worth of long positions were liquidated in Bitcoin's
recent price drop. Analysts expect this to be a short-term downturn
before the market improves. Despite the dip, demand from Bitcoin
whales is growing, with demand from holders outstripping the market
supply of new Bitcoin for the first time.

 ETHEREUM'S NEXT HARDFORK: PECTRA (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pectra is Ethereum's next hardfork, expected to go live in Q4 2024/Q1
2025. The name combines ‚ÄòPrague,' the execution layer upgrade, and
‚ÄòElectra,' the consensus layer upgrade. It will include EIP-7251,
which allows validators to stake more than 32 ETH, and EIP-3074, which
upgrades account abstraction, among other improvements.

 THE UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE OF ETHEREUM (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article compares Bitcoin's big block versus small block debate
to the modern-day monolithic versus modular architecture argument
between Solana and Ethereum. It states that Ethereum's approach, where
the L1 is the small block basis for big block L2s, provides an ideal
amount of coordination and sovereignty to facilitate interoperability
yet still allow for independent ecosystems. By synergizing big and
small block ideas, Ethereum achieves greater security and
composability while making ETH the default unit of account for L2s. 

 AN OVERVIEW OF CRYPTO IN ASIA (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This author describes learnings from talking to founders and
investors in Hong Kong. For example, more people in Indonesia own
crypto than stocks, and their trading volume skews towards longer tail
assets. The general view is that both stocks and crypto are like a
casino and even institutional investors in Asia seem to have a higher
tolerance for risk in buying liquid tokens.

 THE DECENTRALIZED COMPUTE NARRATIVE (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The next big narrative in crypto might be centered around GPU and
cloud computing infrastructure, driven by the growing demand for
artificial intelligence training and the asymmetry between rapidly
advancing software and the slower pace of hardware development. Sam
Altman's plan to raise trillions to accelerate chip manufacturing, the
potential reunification of China and Taiwan, and the upcoming io.net
token generation in April could catalyze interest in this narrative.
Numerous projects in this sector could capitalize on this ‚ÄúGPU is
the new oil‚Äù sentiment. 

 WHY CRYPTOPUNKS ARE [STILL] VALUABLE (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Though NFTs have seen much less interest than in the previous bull
market, they represent the evolution of how artists and collectors can
place meaning on a work ‚Äì by permanently inscribing it in a
blockchain, timestamped at the moment, a collector realizes its
importance. At the same time, the art industry is slowly developing
the knowledge to value and distinguish NFT collections from one
another. The movement of speculation from NFTs to memecoins has
flushed out most of the market's inflated prices. As one of the
original PFP collections, CryptoPunks is a market leader responsible
for many of the trends and characteristics that future collections
will use for inspiration, cementing its status as a pivotal work.
