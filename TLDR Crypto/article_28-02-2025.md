 SEC SAYS MEMECOINS AREN'T SECURITIES BUT FRAUD STILL A RISK (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The U.S. SEC's Division of Corporation Finance stated memecoins do
not qualify as securities under federal law, as they lack profit
promises or ties to business ventures, exempting them from
registration. However, the SEC warned that projects falsely labeling
tokens as memecoins to evade regulations could face legal action,
emphasizing fraud risks under other laws. This stance aligns with a
more crypto-friendly SEC approach under new leadership, including
Chair Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce's task force,
following recent case withdrawals against major platforms like
Coinbase. 

 SEC DROPS CONSENSYS CASE (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Consensys announced an in-principle agreement with the SEC to dismiss
its enforcement case against MetaMask, pending final approval, marking
a resolution without admitting wrongdoing. The company emphasized its
commitment to defending blockchain developers against regulatory
overreach, noting its prior legal pushback also led the SEC to drop an
Ethereum probe. Consensys has praised its legal team and the SEC's new
leadership for fostering pro-innovation policies. It has pledged to
focus on advancing Ethereum and decentralized tech in 2025.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BUILDING FOR THE LONG-TERM: MAKING BASE FASTER, SIMPLER, AND MORE
POWERFUL (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Base announced several new infrastructure improvements at ETHDenver.
Flashblocks, now available on Base Sepolia testnet, reduce effective
block times from 2 seconds to 200 milliseconds, making Base the
fastest EVM chain to date with mainnet launch planned for Q2. Base
Appchains provide Layer-3 dedicated blockspace for high-traffic
applications using op-enclave technology and AWS infrastructure, with
Blocklords, Super Champs, Metacade, and others already adopting this
scaling solution. Smart Wallet Sub Accounts, also launching on mainnet
in Q2, eliminate the need to manage multiple onchain accounts by
enabling hierarchical ownership and spend permissions. 

 UNISWAP TAPS ROBINHOOD, MOONPAY, AND TRANSAK FOR NATIVE OFF-RAMPS TO
'MOVE BETWEEN CRYPTO AND CASH' (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Uniswap Labs has launched native fiat off-ramps in its wallet through
partnerships with Robinhood, MoonPay, and Transak, enabling users in
180+ countries to convert crypto into cash and deposit funds directly
into bank accounts. Available initially on iOS and Android, the
feature allows users to swap supported tokens into stablecoins or ETH.
Uniswap plans to expand the functionality to its browser extension and
website soon. This follows recent upgrades like Uniswap v4 and its
Unichain Layer 2, aligning with MetaMask's recent expansion of fiat
off-ramps via Transak across multiple blockchains.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE NEW AGENT PLAYBOOK FOR BUILDERS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There has been a shift in AI agent development strategy from "Agent
as a Framework" to "Agent as a Business," with successful agent
launches now seeing a maximum market cap of ~$10M compared to ~$100M+
a few months ago. The new playbook emphasizes three simultaneous
products builders must manage: a core product solving real problems
with product-market fit and revenue, a token serving as an alignment
tool rather than a necessity, and the conversational agent itself as a
complementary product enhancing the core offering. Case studies of
successful implementations include Kaito's enterprise crypto search
engine approach and Cookie's freemium model. 

 LIT PROTOCOL: TOWARD AUTONOMY ON THE USER-OWNED WEB (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Lit Protocol provides decentralized key management infrastructure
using MPC and TEEs to distribute key shares across nodes, securing
assets while maintaining user control without exposing private keys.
The protocol enables three emerging use cases: autonomous DeFi agents
with non-custodial wallets, cross-chain orchestration across EVM and
non-EVM networks, and privacy-preserving data access for AI
applications. Since its February 2024 mainnet beta launch, Lit has
secured over $100 million in assets, processed 15+ million requests
with 300% month-over-month growth, and fostered an ecosystem of 70+
projects. Lit's upcoming developments include LLM tools for AI agents
and Fully Homomorphic Encryption keys.

 SAFE WALLET STATEMENT ON BYBIT HACK (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Safe{Wallet} has confirmed that the recent attack on Bybit was
executed by North Korea's Lazarus Group, which compromised a
Safe{Wallet} developer's machine to propose a disguised malicious
transaction to a Bybit-operated account. Forensic investigators found
no vulnerabilities in Safe's smart contracts or frontend source code,
with the issue stemming solely from the compromised developer
credentials. The team has fully rebuilt infrastructure, rotated all
credentials, and restored Safe{Wallet} services on the Ethereum
mainnet with additional security measures implemented. In response to
the incident, Safe has committed to spearheading an industry-wide
initiative focused on improving transaction verifiability, which it
describes as an ecosystem-wide challenge. 

 STABLECOINS FROM PATRICK COLLISON (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Stripe is working with some of the world's largest businesses on
stablecoin strategies to enable faster global expansion and simplify
fund custody. The company sees these digital currencies as new
financial tools for broader adoption, which aligns with its larger
vision to make complex financial processes more accessible and
efficient for businesses worldwide.
