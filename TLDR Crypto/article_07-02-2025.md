MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CZECH PRESIDENT SIGNS LAW EXEMPTING CAPITAL GAINS TAXES ON CRYPTO
HELD FOR THREE YEARS (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Czech Republic has exempted crypto holdings from capital gains if
held for more than 3 years, with retroactive application to assets
purchased before 2025. The tax reform aligns with the European Union's
Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, which has generally been
seen as controversial, though the country has been routinely
introducing crypto-friendly initiatives. The National Bank previously
proposed to allocate 5% of its â‚¬140 billion reserves to Bitcoin. 

 LAW FIRM DEMANDS PUMP.FUN REMOVE OVER 200 MEMECOINS USING ITS IP (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pump.fun, a Solana-based meme coin platform, has been served a cease
and desist letter by Burwick Law and Wolf Popper LLP for allegedly
facilitating the creation of over 200 tokens that infringe upon their
intellectual property. The law firms demand the immediate removal of
these unauthorized tokens, citing concerns over investor deception and
market manipulation

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING AGENT WALLETS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Crossmint has introduced Agent Wallets, a non-custodial wallet
solution designed for AI agent providers and launchpads that enables
autonomous on-chain interactions while ensuring regulatory compliance.
Each wallet uses two separate keys, one for the owner and one for the
agent, secured through trusted execution environments (TEEs), removing
custody risks for providers. 

 ONDO FINANCE ANNOUNCES ONDO CHAIN (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ondo Chain is a new L1 blockchain designed to support institutional
real-world asset (RWA) tokenization that bridges the gap between
TradFi and DeFi. The chain addresses DeFi incompatibility, cross-chain
liquidity fragmentation, high transaction fees, and institutional
regulatory concerns. Ultimately, the Ondo Finance team hopes to enable
seamless cross-chain asset issuance, institutional participation, and
scalable financial applications.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE AGENTIC ECONOMY: WEB2 & WEB3 AI AGENT TRENDS (12 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Agents are a growing narrative in both web2 and web3, as indicated by
Y Combinator's request for startups in various AI agent development
sectors, including developer tools, personal assistants, AI app
stores, and business-to-agent infrastructure. In crypto, projects like
Eliza are advancing the open-source development narrative, while
Virtuals is powering agent societies and economies. The convergence of
AI and crypto introduces a new paradigm for autonomous economic
participation, with specialized agents handling tasks like DeFi and
social analysis, supported by emerging infrastructure for
agent-to-agent communication and transactions. The post also
highlights specific builders in each of the YC sectors. 

 DEFAI: ACHIEVING THE EFFICIENCY FRONTIER (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DeFAI is an elegant abstraction of complex crypto topics and
portfolio optimization behind natural language intents. The DeFAI
stack consists of three layers - Abstraction, Reasoning, and Execution
- with reasoning becoming the key differentiator through proprietary
data, broader tooling, and quality prompt engineering. The execution
layer is expected to become commoditized, and value will move to
protocols that integrate AI as opposed to the agents themselves.

[10] 

 VanEck predicts Solana (SOL) will hit $520 by the end of 2025, based

Solana's share rising to 22%, leading to a ~$250B valuation. 

 DIFFICULTIES AROUND BASE SUCCESS (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Base seems to be having issues with declining Virtuals revenue, a
lack of Coinbase support for key projects, and teams migrating to
other chains like Solana because of better UX and more liquidity.
While Base has the potential to onboard millions, its marketing
strategy (not degen enough) and engagement with the crypto community
may hinder its ability to compete effectively with Solana.
