MARKETS & BUSINESS

 ETHEREUM'S TOKENIZED RWA MARKET GROWS 315% TO $17B (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Ethereum's tokenized real-world asset market has grown 315% year over
year to surpass $17 billion on mainnet, now accounting for roughly 34%
of total onchain RWA value across blockchains, as institutions like
BlackRock and JPMorgan expand tokenized Treasury and money market
products. With stablecoins on Ethereum topping $175 billion and new
activity in tokenized commodities like gold, the network is
solidifying its role as the primary settlement layer for
institutional-grade, dollar-denominated assets moving onchain. 

 TON + BANXA BRING CHEAP STABLECOIN PAYMENTS TO APAC SMES (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The TON Foundation is partnering with Banxa (part of OSL Group) to
offer stablecoin payment processing for APAC small and medium
businesses. This combines Banxa's fiat on/off-ramps and OSL merchant
infrastructure with TON's fast, low-cost settlement (building on TON
Pay's sub-$0.01 fees and sub-second settlements) to enable B2B, C2B,
and cross-border transactions while tapping OSL's enlarged capital
base from recent equity raises.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ERC-8162: THE SUBSCRIPTION LAYER FOR THE AGENTIC ECONOMY (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 ERC-8162 proposes a subscription protocol for onchain AI agents
complementing x402's per-request model, enabling tiered cycle-based
access plans where a single onchain transaction grants
zero-marginal-cost access for the subscription period. The protocol
enforces direct settlement and uses EIP-712 signature recovery for
self-contained, trustless access verification over the same HTTP 402
surface as x402. A notable architectural property is its elimination
of combinatorial billing in multi-agent call chains: where per-request
costs compound multiplicatively across deep agent-to-agent
compositions, subscriptions reduce inter-agent call costs to zero
after the initial commitment. 

 OPENCLAW AND BANKR: SELF-FUNDING AGENTS AND COMPUTE (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A new architecture combining OpenClaw's agent execution layer with
Bankr's financial rails demonstrates a self-funding autonomous agent
running on consumer hardware, capable of deploying tokens, executing
AMM swaps, opening leveraged positions, and trading on Polymarket
while routing fees back to its own wallet. The economic model targets
closure of the compute cost loop by having the agent identify and
extract onchain market edge, with profits recycling into the token to
generate additional fee revenue. Unsolved problems constraining full
autonomy remain: persistent shared memory architecture across
sessions, automatic skill discovery, and eliminating residual human
touchpoints in authentication flows.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STABLECOINS ARE BECOMING EVERYDAY MONEY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A global study by BVNK, Coinbase, and Artemis found that stablecoins
are shifting from trading tools to everyday financial rails. 54% of
surveyed crypto users held stablecoins in the past year, holders
allocate about one-third of their savings to crypto and stablecoins,
and freelancers report roughly 35% of annual earnings paid in
stablecoins. Widespread use is driven by lower fees and improved
cross-border work but adoption frictions like irreversible payments,
wallet complexity, and inconsistent merchant acceptance remain.
Broader consumer protection and merchant infrastructure are still
needed for stablecoins to function as true digital cash. 

 PREDICTION MARKETS ARE THE AGENTIC BAZAAR (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Decentralized prediction markets are positioned as the natural
economic substrate for sovereign AI agents, which require programmatic
access to compute, data, and information markets to achieve genuine
economic self-sufficiency. Unlike complex financial instruments,
prediction markets allow any participant to create and settle markets
over any outcome directly, reducing friction for agents to monetize
informational alpha. At aggregate scale, this dynamic resembles
parallelized reinforcement learning: always-on market incentives
continuously align agent behavior through economic participation
rather than centralized training regimes, with reproducible
computation enabling trustless dispute resolution.

 THE FRICTION TAX (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Legacy credit card infrastructure causes a 5% monthly failure rate,
driving significant involuntary churn. Transitioning to programmable
smart contract wallets eliminates these failures, improving net
revenue retention and gross margins. This shift is critical as
AI-driven usage-based pricing increases billing frequency and
potential failure points. 

 TOKENIZATION WAS STEP ONE, THE CREDIT MARKET IS STEP TWO (6 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 RWA tokenization has reached $24.78B in distributed asset value
across 846K holders, with tokenized Treasuries at $10.71B and private
credit at $20.53B in active loans averaging 10.18% APR, but the credit
infrastructure enabling these assets to function as scalable
collateral remains absent. Existing DeFi lending architectures expose
structural gaps, like venue-first designs with unified liquidation
models that break under stress. Avon protocol applies a TradFi
syndication model, maintaining isolated facilities with
asset-appropriate enforcement while a matching layer aggregates
execution, so borrowers access unified market depth without individual
lenders compromising their mandates.
