MARKETS & BUSINESS

 EL SALVADOR SPLITS BITCOIN ACROSS 14 WALLETS TO REDUCE QUANTUM RISK
(4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 El Salvador has transferred its entire Bitcoin reserve of 6,274 BTC
($678 million) from a single wallet into 14 separate addresses, with
each new wallet holding up to 500 BTC. The Central American nation
implemented this security measure as a precaution against potential
future quantum computing threats, which could theoretically crack
Bitcoin's elliptic curve cryptography and compromise funds stored in
addresses with exposed public keys. While quantum computing currently
poses no immediate threat to Bitcoin security, existing quantum
computers are unable to crack even basic encryption keys. Distributing
funds across multiple addresses would minimize the impact of any
potential quantum attack, as public keys are only revealed after BTC
is spent. 

 STRATEGY'S PREFERRED SHARES FORM A BULLISH CIRCLE AROUND BITCOIN (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Strategy raised $5.6 billion year-to-date through four preferred
stock offerings (STRK, STRF, STRD, and STRC), representing 12% of all
U.S. IPO issuance in 2025 and cementing its position as the largest
corporate Bitcoin holder with 632,457 BTC. Performance across the
preferred shares has diverged significantly, with STRF leading at 31%
returns, STRK at 19%, STRC at 8%, while STRD posted a negative 6%
return. Despite the company's aggressive Bitcoin accumulation
strategy, MSTR shares have underperformed Bitcoin itself, gaining 13%
year-to-date compared to Bitcoin's 18% rise, as the stock trades at a
1.60x multiple to its Bitcoin net asset value.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BETH: ETHEREUM'S PROOF OF BURN TOKEN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ethereum's new BETH token represents provably burned ETH, formalizing
scarcity and making destruction auditable onchain. Users can burn ETH
via a contract and receive BETH 1:1, turning Ethereum's burn mechanic
into a transferable asset. This opens up new design space for DeFi,
governance, and financial instruments built around proof of burn. 

 ETHEREUM FOUNDATION AIMS TO MAKE LAYER 2S FEEL LIKE ONE CHAIN (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Ethereum Foundation has unveiled a roadmap to address Layer 2
fragmentation through three workstreams: Initialisation, Acceleration,
and Finalisation, aimed at making cross-L2 activity feel seamless. The
initiative introduces an Open Intents Framework and Ethereum
Interoperability Layer (EIL) to enable trustless cross-chain
transactions, while targeting faster L1 confirmations of 15-30 seconds
and exploring potential slot time reductions from 12 to 6 seconds. Key
deliverables include production contracts for the intents framework by
Q4 2025, broad availability of fast confirmation rules by Q1 2026, and
ongoing research into zero-knowledge proof integration for real-time
settlement.

 AI REVENUE ENGINES: THE GATEWAY TO BROADER ADOPTION (12 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Decentralized AI (DeAI) protocols are beginning to generate revenue
through compute, data, and agent services. Multiple DeAI projects
across categories, including fine-tuned models, DePIN infrastructure,
portfolio management, and agent launchpads, are demonstrating
product-market fit with users willing to pay for services, mirroring
how centralized AI companies reach $30 million in revenue 5x faster
than traditional SaaS. Despite AI being the most disruptive technology
of the current era, AI tokens represent only 1.9% of the total altcoin
market cap, suggesting significant undervaluation relative to their
revenue-generating potential. 

 THE 2025 CRYPTO CARD COMPARISON (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The crypto card market is evolving beyond simple prepaid wrappers
toward solutions that leverage crypto's core advantages, with new
offerings in 2025 focusing on four key differentiators: custody, yield
generation, multi-chain flexibility, and privacy. EtherFi Cash leads
the DeFi-native approach by allowing users to spend directly from
yield-generating vaults – earning 9-12% on USDC while maintaining
3%+ cashback – while PAYY prioritizes privacy through zero-knowledge
settlement, and Cypher enables spending across 500+ tokens on 18+
chains. Traditional players like Coinbase are also entering with
mainstream credit card offerings featuring crypto rewards.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CFTC, ETFS, AND THE SHAPE OF THIS BULL (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The current bull market will be driven by ETFs, centralized
exchanges, and digital asset treasuries. Retail enthusiasm for onchain
“gambling” like memecoins and NFTs has faded. DeFi will benefit if
ETF investors push into onchain financial infrastructure while broader
crypto adoption shifts toward payments, global settlement of USD/RWAs,
and BTC/ETH as stores of value. 

 ETHEREUM AS THE FUTURE OF FINANCE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Wall Street will inevitably migrate to Ethereum rails, staking,
running validators, and using DeFi to replace siloed legacy
infrastructure. ETH will overtake BTC and ultimately become the base
layer of global finance as decentralized trust is the ultimate
commodity.

from the UK, Ukraine, Bhutan, and El Salvador) have less Bitcoin than
Strategy (632K+ BTC).

States.
