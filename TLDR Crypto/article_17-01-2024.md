 PROSHARES FILES FOR FIVE LEVERAGED AND INVERSE BITCOIN ETFS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 ProShares has submitted proposals for five leveraged and inverse
Bitcoin ETFs. This comes on the heels of the SEC's approval of 11 spot
Bitcoin ETFs. The five proposed funds are named ProShares Plus Bitcoin
ETF, ProShares Ultra Bitcoin ETF, ProShares UltraShort Bitcoin ETF,
ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF, and ProShares ShortPlus Bitcoin ETF. The
spot Bitcoin ETFs are off to a fast start, with billions of dollars in
trading volume in the first few days, so these proposed ETFs are
presumably aiming to capitalize on that, giving investors more ways to
get exposure to Bitcoin, either by shorting it or being able to
leverage long it. 

 WALL STREET CEO ON TETHER CONTROVERSY: 'THEY HAVE THE MONEY' (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cantor Fitzgerald's CEO Howard Lutnick came out and publicly defended
the legitimacy of USDT, supporting the company's claims of having
adequate funds backing the asset. Noting the firm's recent assertion
that its reserves consist primarily of US Treasuries, Lutnick
confirmed managing many of Tether's assets. Tether has long drawn the
ire of skeptics who doubted that it had the reserves it claimed to,
and this has created an overhang that many in the industry have
constantly worried about.

 SOLANA ECO AIRDROP FARMING MASTERCLASS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread lays out a strategy for optimizing airdrop allocations
and yield farming throughout the Solana ecosystem. Combining Drift
with other tokenless protocols, the author claims users can follow
this method to potentially achieve triple-digit yields. Steps include
adjusting settings in Drift Protocol, monitoring APR, and buying spot
positions to hedge against short positions. The strategy also involves
lending or depositing spot positions, and staking SOL for increased
yield. Users can also employ rate arbitrage or directional trade
according to their preferred risk levels.

 WHAT MULTICOIN IS EXCITED ABOUT FOR 2024 (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article discusses several trends and opportunities Multicoin -
of Solana fame - is looking forward to in 2024. The topics covered
include the increasing importance of "attention theory" in determining
the value of a variety of entities, the potential for
stablecoin-powered remittances in emerging markets, and the growing
influence of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies in fields such
as novel marketplaces, remittances, and social applications. 

 COBIE‚ÄôS THESIS ON BLAST (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This post lays out a thesis for Blast and other L2s like it. The
growing commodification of L2 blockchain solutions is driving
competition for users, attention, and traction amid an increasing
number of L2s. This shifts user behavior and has caused protocols to
focus on incentivizing on-chain activities. Despite criticism around
the way it launched, Blast has attracted more TVL than established L2s
like Coinbase's Base. The fact that many complained about the launch
but also bridged assets to the L2 highlights the more general mismatch
between public sentiment and private actions in the crypto space.
