 BRIDGE USDC → USDH ON HYPERLIQUID WITH ZERO FEES OR SLIPPAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most traders lose money before they even place a trade. Bridging USDC
into Hyperliquid [4] means eating slippage, swap fees, and bad
execution along the way.

Don't be like most traders. Use Across Protocol [4] to bridge USDC
from any chain straight into USDH - for FREE. That means:

→ ZERO SLIPPAGE: 1 USDC = 1 USDH, guaranteed

→ ZERO BRIDGE FEES: no tolls, no hidden costs

→ ZERO GAS FEES: only pay origin chain gas

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CHINA TO INTENSIFY CRACKDOWN ON VIRTUAL CURRENCIES (6 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 China's inter-agency meeting reiterated that virtual currencies lack
legal fiat status, with all related activities constituting illegal
financial operations. Vowing intensified crackdowns on speculative
trading, the meeting specifically warned that stablecoins lack proper
KYC and AML protections, enabling money laundering, illicit
cross-border financing, and fraud, contrasting sharply with the US'
favorable stablecoin regulatory environment under the recent GENIUS
Act framework. The announcement comes despite China reemerging as the
world's third-largest Bitcoin mining hub while Hong Kong operates
under a separate autonomous jurisdiction with government-supported
crypto initiatives. 

 KALSHI HIT WITH CLASS-ACTION (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Kalshi is facing a nationwide class action lawsuit alleging it
operates an illegal sports betting platform by positioning
institutional market makers, including Kalshi Trading and Susquehanna,
as "the house" with zero fees, enhanced access, and position limit
advantages while misleading customers that they're betting
peer-to-peer. The complaint claims 90% of September's $2 billion
volume came from sports betting despite running ads falsely stating
"legal sports betting in all 50 states" and targeting college campuses
through KalshiU partnerships with a 15-year-old gaming influencer.
Plaintiffs seek treble damages, restitution, and injunctive relief
across a nationwide class and 30 state subclasses, including
California and Florida, where Kalshi allegedly violates Penal Code
337a, which bans pool selling and bookmaking. The lawsuit argues
Kalshi disguises gambling as "sports trading" and "build your combo"
parlays while enabling addictive behavior without the safeguards
required by regulated sportsbooks.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BASTION NAMED SOLE ISSUANCE PROVIDER FOR SONY BANK STABLECOIN (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bastion will act as the sole issuance provider for Sony Bank's new
USD-backed stablecoin initiative, handling token issuance, reserve
management, and custody for Sony affiliates. The deal marks Sony
Bank's entry into the US stablecoin and digital-asset market, using
Bastion's regulated infrastructure to support wallets, on/off ramps,
cards, and yield products. Backing from Sony Innovation Fund, Coinbase
Ventures, a16z crypto, and others demonstrates that large enterprises
increasingly want white-label, compliant stablecoin rails rather than
building everything in-house. 

 SHIFT: SILICON THAT SAYS YES OR NO (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Shift is building a validator-free payment system where
tamper-resistant secure elements confine private keys inside hardware
that tracks balances, prevents double-spends, and signs transactions
internally without ever exposing key material, even under physical
attack. Remote attestation using factory-provisioned keypairs proves
each device is legitimate, unmodified hardware following protocol
rules, with one-time addresses generated and consumed atomically
alongside cryptographic proofs verified by recipient hardware.
Transactions settle device-to-device with the finality of cash
exchange but cryptographic guarantees, as secure elements consume
UTXOs irreversibly, sign with confined keys, and generate change
addresses while attaching attestations that trace to manufacturer root
certificates. The architecture eliminates validators, ledgers, and
seed phrases by moving trust from consensus to tamper-resistant
silicon, enforcing strict state transitions where balance accounting
and signing happen as single atomic operations, preventing
intermediate or inconsistent states.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BITCOIN AND THE QUANTUM PROBLEM (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Quantum computing poses an existential risk to Bitcoin as Shor's
algorithm running on 2,000 logical qubits could reverse-engineer
private keys from public keys, with 6.7 million BTC vulnerable,
including 1.7 million in Satoshi's exposed p2pk addresses and 4.8
million in reused addresses. Evidence suggests CRQCs will arrive by
2035. Threat scenarios range from North Korea monetizing exploits to
China weaponizing quantum breaks against US-associated Bitcoin to
lawful seizure by American entities protecting the strategic reserve. 

 SOLIDITY IS GETTING A REAL TYPE SYSTEM (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum's main programming language, Solidity, is being upgraded to
look and behave more like modern, safer languages. The goal is to make
smart contracts easier to write, reuse, and much harder to break. If
Ethereum pairs this with scaling, privacy, and better L2 integration,
competitors won't be able to keep up.

 MAKING SOLANA COMPOSABLE (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Solana's 1,232-byte transaction limit and accounts model make complex
multi-hop swaps impossible compared to Ethereum, where 50-hop swaps
across 37 tokens work trivially, with Account Lookup Tables providing
cumbersome workarounds requiring V0 transactions and prior
construction. There are three solutions: validator-side account
lookups allowing automatic derivation instead of payload inclusion,
top-level return value passing eliminating scratch accounts for
instruction composition, and native bundling with instruction-level
signatures removing round-trip bottlenecks between parties. Widespread
bundling adoption, massive instructions, and core infrastructure's ALT
reliance signal the network wants composability as markets mature
toward more expressive applications. Proposed changes enable
high-frequency off-chain apps using Solana for atomic settlement. 

 CASH APP + SQUARE CLOSE THE DOOR ON STABLECOIN POS STARTUPS (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Cash App and Square are now offering in-app payments with just a 1%
processing fee, powered by a pooled stored balance that already sees
~$300B flow through Cash App annually. The combo of low fees, huge
user base, and tight merchant integration likely kills the window for
crypto-native POS startups to gain serious distribution as Block's
network effect and UX moat make it extremely hard to compete.

 BEST MONAD FARMS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Monad distributes $65,000 daily to $123 million TVL, yielding 19%
average APR versus Plasma's 1.79% APR on $4.8 billion TVL. 

 ETHEREUM GROWS, BUT ETH DOESN'T (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 ETH is a poor investment above ~$4k because Ethereum's growth is now
happening on L2s, where sequencers like Coinbase capture most fees and
MEV. 

 TOKENIZATION KEEPS CHOOSING ETHEREUM (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager with €2.2T AUM, quietly
launched a tokenized money market fund on Ethereum on November 4 and
only announced it weeks later. 

 PASSKEYS & SECURE ENCLAVE WALLETS ON ETHEREUM (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 EIP-7951 will add native support for the p-256 signature scheme to
Ethereum, the same curve used by Apple, Google, and WebAuthn.
