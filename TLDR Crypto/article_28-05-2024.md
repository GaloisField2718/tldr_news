MARKETS & BUSINESS

 VANGUARD FILES FOR SPECIALIZED FUNDS TRUST, DEFINES DIFFERENT CRYPTO
ASSET TYPES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Vanguard's Specialized Funds Trust registration statement defines
various types of crypto assets. It labels digital currencies as assets
that are a store of value, medium of exchange, or unit of account that
is blockchain-based and not issued by a central authority. A digital
security token invokes some type of ownership over a separate asset. A
digital utility token derives value from providing access to a
particular product or network. 

 FTX BANKRUPTCY HEADLINES MISLEAD THE PUBLIC (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Despite mainstream media headlines suggesting FTX creditors will
recover over 100% of their funds, the actual value users will receive
is significantly less than what the assets could/would have been
worth. Creditors will receive ~118% of their funds fixed to the fiat
value of their assets on FTX's bankruptcy filing date. Many of the
lost currencies (e.g., BTC, SOL, and ETH) have appreciated
significantly since then.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHEREUM LAYER 2 TAIKO GOES LIVE ON MAINNET (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After two years and seven testnets, ZK rollup Taiko has launched its
mainnet. Taiko is a based rollup, meaning Ethereum validators are
responsible for sequencing transactions instead of
foundation-controlled entities. Vitalik Buterin proposed the inaugural
block. 

 WHY ARBITRUM STYLUS IS A BIG DEAL (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Arbitrum Stylus is reducing the barrier of entry for developers by
allowing EVM-compatible smart contracts programmed in C, C++, and
Rust. Stylus improves execution by 10x and scales memory by 50-100x.
Since Solana programs are written in Rust, Stylus applications can be
interoperable with the Solana ecosystem. It's expected to go live on
mainnet in the coming months.

 FARCASTER VS. LENS PROTOCOL (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Decentralized social media protocols aim to give users ownership and
power over their data. Farcaster is known for its engaging content and
Frames â€“ mini-apps allowing unique interactions with onchain
content. Lens Protocol has been creator-focused, with customization
around following and post collection. It has a similar albeit
less-used Frames competitor called Open Actions. Farcaster's memecoin
DEGEN and Lens' BONSAI act as a tipping and quality content
incentivization mechanism, though DEGEN has grown much larger and has
its own L3. 

 ANALYZING THE PERFORMANCE OF CELEBRITY-PROMOTED CRYPTO PROJECTS (1
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Historically, celebrity-owned or promoted cryptocurrency projects
have generally failed, often due to a lack of genuine interest and
commitment from the celebrities themselves, who typically engage more
for immediate financial gain than for long-term project development.
The trend suggests minimal effort in project execution, with many
using low-quality art and lacking substantial backing, casting doubt
on the potential success of Caitlyn Jenner's new coin venture.
