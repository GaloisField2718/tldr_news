 YOUR DATA MADE THEM BILLIONSâ€”NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO PROFIT (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 ðŸš¨Open AI reached a valuation of $340 billion this year, all on the
back of your data.

The big data gold rush is here, but profits have been hoarded by AI
and tech giantsâ€¦ Until now.

Instead of hoarding data, Mode Mobile is sharing the profits from it,
all by TURNING YOUR SMARTPHONE INTO AN INCOME-GENERATING ASSET. [4]
Here's what that looks like:

 	* Paid over $325M to over $45M users.
 	* Generated 32,481% revenue growth.
 	* Previously ranked #1 FASTEST-GROWING SOFTWARE COMPANY [4] by
Deloitte.

ðŸ“²Their _EarnPhone_ could be the biggest disruption to smartphones
since the iPhone, and they're gearing up for a potential IPO on the
Nasdaq (ticker: $MODE).

But the real opportunity is now, and you can still invest in Mode's
pre-IPO offering at just $0.26/share.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEN. LUMMIS REINTRODUCES BILL TO CREATE TRUMP'S PLANNED STRATEGIC
BITCOIN RESERVE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Senator Cynthia Lummis has reintroduced a bill to establish a U.S.
strategic bitcoin reserve, aligning with President Trump's recent
executive order. The proposed legislation, which aims to boost the
national balance sheet and maintain American economic competitiveness,
would authorize a million-unit bitcoin purchase program and create
secure vaults operated by the Treasury. 

 CANTOR FITZGERALD'S BITCOIN BUSINESS TO USE ANCHORAGE DIGITAL AND
COPPER (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cantor Fitzgerald is partnering with Anchorage Digital and Copper to
safeguard digital assets as collateral in its new Bitcoin financing
business, which is expected to launch with $2 billion in initial
financing. This move aims to provide leverage to Bitcoin investors by
bridging traditional financial services with industry-leading crypto
custody and security solutions.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING THE 3JANE WHITEPAPER (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 3Jane introduces a groundbreaking money market on Ethereum that
enables users to borrow USDC with 0% collateral by leveraging
verifiable financial proofs instead of onchain assets. It aims to
unlock new capital efficiency and expand crypto credit access by
bridging DeFi, CEX, and traditional banking. 

 SCALING BITCOIN + ETHEREUM TOGETHER (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Starknet plans to become the first Layer 2 to settle on both Bitcoin
and Ethereum. It uses ZK-STARKs to scale Bitcoin from 7 TPS to
thousands, reduce fees to $0.002, and enable
cryptographically-secured, trustless DeFi by early 2026. The Bitcoin
bridge strategy will start with federated models, advancing to BitVM,
and ultimately supporting OP_CAT for trustless bridging and
withdrawal. The unified L2 approach will promote greater cross-chain
liquidity and interoperability.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE PATH TO SECURE AND EFFICIENT ZKVMS: HOW TO TRACK PROGRESS (15
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 zkVMs aim to simplify zero-knowledge cryptography adoption for
proving program execution for applications, but faces hurdles with
security vulnerabilities and performance overhead being a million
times slower than native execution. A proposed roadmap outlines staged
goals over 2-4 years to achieve secure implementations and reduce
proving overhead exponentially. These advancements could reshape how
blockchains scale and provide privacy-preserving properties. 

 BEST SOL YIELDS IN DEFI (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Solana is gaining traction as a viable contender for institutional
investments and may capture significant market share within the RWA
space. Among the highest-yield opportunities include Renzo Protocol's
ezSOL on Kamino, delivering up to 40% APY through leveraged staking
strategies. Other notable opportunities include SOL/JLP liquidity
pools that have returned over 50% APR while maintaining heavy exposure
to SOL.

 TAPROOT WIZARDS MINT (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 After two years of anticipation, Taproot Wizards is officially
launching its mint on March 25. With only 2,121 available, minting
options include discounted access for Quantum Cats holders, a
whitelist for dedicated supporters, and a Dutch auction for the
general public. 

 L2 BLOCKS ARE STUPID (BUT IT'S FINE) (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Unlike L1 blocks, which are critical for consensus and chain
integrity, L2 blocks are largely artificial constructs batched for L1
settlement, rendering low block times an adjustable and overhyped
engineering metric. Advances like streaming mini-blocks, which reduce
intervals to as low as 15ms, improve transaction visibility by
speeding up communication between sequencers and RPC nodes. Streaming
blocks shift attention from block time marketing to the real driver of
L2 user experience: efficient execution and network latency.
