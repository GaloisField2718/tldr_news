MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN BOUNCE, STILL FRAGILE (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin has rebounded to around $87.5K after dipping near $81K, with
analysts calling it a “post-flush bounce” rather than a full
recovery. Market structure is fragile. BTC is expected to chop in a
tight $85K–$90K range while long-term holders quietly accumulate. 

 BITCOIN LOGS LONGEST LOSING STREAK SINCE 2024 (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin tracked its fourth consecutive weekly loss, marking the
longest downtrend since June 2024. Q4 2025 looked like its worst
quarterly performance since 2018 at -24% despite bouncing 6% from the
November 21 low of $82,100 to $87,400. The aggregate spot bid-ask
delta at 10% depth spiked to 2025's second-highest level, indicating
dip-buying activity, while Federal Reserve rate cut odds surged from
40% to 70% last week. There is a potential bull trap with options
traders loading puts in the $80,000-$85,000 range, meaning Bitcoin
could briefly slip to mid-to-high $70,000s before recovering to
$90,000 by year-end if the Fed avoids hawkish tone. Recovery to
$100,000 is expected by Q1 2026.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 REAL-TIME BLOCK PROVING USING AIRBENDER (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 zkSync's Airbender prover achieved real-time Ethereum L1 block proof
generation using just two consumer-grade RTX 5090 GPUs, prompting
Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake to suggest the
breakthrough could enable "gigagas L1" with significantly higher gas
limits pushing L2 fees toward zero. Vitalik Buterin praised the "huge
milestone" but cautioned about worst-case performance gaps where
proving times can differ by 60x between average and worst-case blocks,
recommending repricing gas for expensive operations like RSA
verification rather than hardware arms races. The achievement was
showcased at Ethproofs Day in Buenos Aires and marks a shift in
Ethereum's scaling trajectory as consumer-grade proving becomes
feasible compared to historical data center resource requirements. 

 LEVERAGE ON PREDICTION MARKETS IS POSSIBLE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Leverage in prediction markets faces fundamental challenges because
instant price jumps to zero eliminate liquidation windows, requiring
financiers to price expected losses upfront, but naive
probability-based fees merely create accounting tricks where levered
ROI equals unleveraged positions. The solution splits price movements
into "creep" (continuous drift allowing liquidation) versus "jumps"
(instant gaps with no reaction time) and prices risk over short epochs
with rolling per-epoch fees similar to perps funding rather than
pricing entire position lifespans. This epoch-based approach treats
drift, volatility, and jump rates as frozen constants within small
time windows, computing liquidation probabilities and average losses
separately for creep versus jumps, while limiting misspecification
risk that could wildly over- or underestimate fees as market
conditions shift near resolution dates. The architecture includes
block-level auction designs capturing news-driven arbitrage to rebate
market makers and financiers, further reducing effective jump losses
and fees charged to traders.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO PROFIT ON CORRELATED POLYMARKET BETS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 You can often get better risk/reward on Polymarket by trading
relationships between markets instead of single yes/no outcomes. Three
ways to do this include time spreads on the same event,
“either-extreme-wins” baskets, and logical/arbitrage-style bets
across correlated AI markets. 

 $12B IN DEFI LIQUIDITY SITS IDLE (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 83-95% of liquidity in major DeFi pools, including Uniswap and Curve,
sits idle, with only 0.5% of Uniswap v2's liquidity falling within
active trading ranges, leaving nearly $1.8 billion ineffective. Retail
liquidity providers bear the brunt as 50% lose money from impermanent
loss with net deficits exceeding $60 million, including one Uniswap v3
pool losing over $30 million to Just-in-Time manipulation. 1inch's
Aqua protocol could be a solution as it allows DeFi applications to
share a common capital base across strategies while users keep assets
in wallets and create "virtual trading positions," with any existing
DEX implementable under 10 lines of code. The liquidity crisis stems
from over 7 million fragmented pools across the ecosystem diluting
capital and reducing routing efficiency for trades.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PREDICTION MARKET FEE WARS BEGIN (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Big brokerages in the US are starting to treat prediction markets as
commoditized backends. Kalshi is already rebating up to half its fees
to Webull for order flow, while Robinhood is signaling it will route
prediction orders across multiple venues and eventually squeeze fees
or build its own markets. 

 OFFCHAIN LABS CHALLENGES VITALIK'S RISC-V PROPOSAL (6 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Offchain Labs challenged Vitalik Buterin's proposal to transition
Ethereum's execution layer to RISC-V, arguing WebAssembly offers
superior long-term advantages by distinguishing between "delivery ISA"
for uploading contracts versus "proving ISA" for ZK virtual machines.
Arbitrum already proves WASM-based Stylus smart contracts by compiling
WASM to RISC-V first, and enshrining RISC-V on L1 could lock Ethereum
into proving technology just as better alternatives emerge. WASM's
structured design, efficient execution on common hardware without
emulation, validation capabilities preventing vulnerabilities, and
mature tooling ecosystem position it as an "Internet Protocol for
smart contracts" as ZK proving costs have plummeted to $0.025 per
block.
