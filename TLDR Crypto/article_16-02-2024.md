hearing. Experts from prominent crypto businesses including Coinbase
and Circle will be speaking at the event. Its focus will likely be on

laws for the cryptocurrency sector. 

 VANECK CUTS BITCOIN ETF FEES AS COMPETITION AMONG ISSUERS INTENSIFIES
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 VanEck is reducing the sponsor fee of its HODL spot Bitcoin ETF from
0.25% to 0.20% effective February 21. The move is a response to
competitive pressures to attract more investors in the rapidly
evolving ETF landscape. ETFs are often a winner-take-most market, so
cutting fees in the crowded market is the primary way issuers have
been trying to gain market share.

 Crypto game Ascend has launched, aiming to unlock untapped yield
potential in NFTs. MetaStreet, the company behind Ascend, raised $25
million to fund what it is calling Liquid Credit Tokens (LCTs) to
create scalable capital markets for on-chain illiquid assets. Its aim

and individual investors to participate equally. The company expects
$3.5 billion of sustainable new yields from the NFT market with LCTs.

 BREAKING BFT: QUANTIFYING THE COST TO ATTACK BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM (60
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers used the Total Cost to Attack model to assess the
feasibility of 51% attacks on Bitcoin and 34% attacks on Ethereum.
This model incorporates the operational and capital expenditures
required for such attacks, considering both profit-driven and
ideologically motivated attackers. They found that the security
mechanisms in place make these attacks economically impractical,
providing evidence of Nash Equilibrium in the networks. The research
questions the assumption that network security linearly correlates
with fee revenue, suggesting that miner speculation on fee cycles
actually enhances security. 

 ON ALPHA AND EDGES IN CRYPTO (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This thread goes over the concepts of "Alpha" and "Edge" in crypto.
Alpha refers to information that can be utilized for financial gains,
while edge involves extracting yield from the market using a superior
skill or understanding. The thread describes three types of alpha:
time-sensitive alpha, mass psychology-based alpha, and intuition-based
alpha, providing detailed examples for each type.

 U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE GOV. WALLER SAYS DEFI COULD BOOST DOLLAR'S
GLOBAL STRENGTH (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Fed Governor Christopher Waller argues that the majority of
stablecoins, which are largely tied to the dollar, could actually
strengthen the dollar‚Äôs hegemony. His basic position on this is that
stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, they are central to DeFi, and
DeFi activity is continuing to grow at a rapid rate. While
acknowledging potential risks if a shift from dollars to digital
currencies occurs, Waller dismissed these fears, reiterating that the
dollar will continue to stay central to economic activity no matter
what technology that activity is leveraging. 

 COINBASE IS SO BACK (IN PROFIT): STOCK JUMPS 11% AS CRYPTO EXCHANGE
POSTS BULLISH RETURNS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Coinbase bounced back from losses in Q3 to report a
better-than-expected Q4 largely driven by higher interest income on
its stablecoin reserves and other products. The markets responded
positively to these surprising income numbers and to the efficiencies
created on expenses within the business. What was most interesting
about this quarter‚Äôs report for Coinbase were the signs of retail
volumes coming back with higher-than-expected volumes in that segment
of the business.

[15]
