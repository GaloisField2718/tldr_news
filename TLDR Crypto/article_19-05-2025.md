MARKETS & BUSINESS

 STABLECOIN BILL COULD CLEAR SENATE NEXT WEEK (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Senators Hagerty (R) and Gillibrand (D) say the bipartisan GENIUS
Act, designed as the first pro‑growth U.S. regulatory framework for
payment stablecoins, could clear the Senate as soon as next week after
modest tweaks to address Democrats' consumer‑protection and
national‑security concerns. The latest draft bars large public
companies like Meta from issuing stablecoins and incorporates
“robust consumer protections” to win broader support. Following a
failed cloture vote, backers are gearing up for a second 60‑vote
threshold today to bring the bill into formal debate and potential
amendment. If enacted, the legislation would set clear standards for
issuers of USDC, USDT, and other dollar‑pegged tokens. 

 MOVEMENT AND MANTRA SCANDALS SHAKE UP MARKET-MAKING (6 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Mantra's OM plunging over 90% in hours and Movement Labs executives
secretly dumping $38 million of MOVE have shattered assumed trust
between market makers and project teams. Firms now insist on full
disclosure of side agreements, token grants, and unlock schedules,
embedding institutional‑grade legal and technical safeguards into
their market‑making contracts. The murky secondary OTC market, where
locked tokens trade off‑market ahead of vesting, has further
distorted supply dynamics and muddied price discovery. In response,
liquidity providers are abandoning informal trust in favor of rigorous
diligence, enforceable tokenomics terms, and clear contingency
frameworks.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING ALLOY V1.0 (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Paradigm has released Alloy v1.0, a new smart contract language and
toolchain for Ethereum designed to replace Solidity with a safer,
faster, and more developer-friendly alternative. Built on Rust and
inspired by Sway and Move, Alloy features a modular architecture,
robust type system, and seamless integration with foundry tooling.
With its formal verification capabilities and compiler-level safety
checks, Alloy aims to raise the security and reliability bar for smart
contract development. 

 ACCELERATING BASE WITH FLASHBLOCKS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Flashblocks, built by Flashbots, introduces 200 ms
“preconfirmation blocks” on Base to cut inclusion times by up to
10x and deliver near‑instant UX. Integration is optional via
Flashblock‑aware RPC providers or direct websocket subscriptions,
with no changes required for legacy nodes that will simply fallback to
2 s block times during outages. Developers must account for locked
transaction ordering per sub‑block and gas‑limit tiers, and handle
rare reorgs and the absence of initial revert protection. Flashblocks
has 99.9% uptime and a seamless fallback system.

 COINBASE'S X402 EXPLAINED: CRYPTO PAYMENTS OVER HTTP (9 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Coinbase's x402 revives the long‑dormant HTTP 402 status code as
a native payment layer for the web, enabling APIs, apps, and AI agents
to request and receive instant stablecoin payments directly over HTTP.
Clients encountering a 402 response include payment details in an
X-PAYMENT header and resubmit the request. Once on‑chain settlement
is confirmed by a facilitator, the server fulfills the resource and
returns an X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE. By embedding programmable,
micropayment‑friendly transfers into standard HTTP without
redirects, plugins, or centralized processors, x402 positions itself
as a foundational protocol for autonomous, machine‑driven commerce. 

 THE KAITO EARN BIBLE (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This guide explains optimized strategies for farming airdrops across
60 Kaito projects, detailing per‑project reward splits and mission
requirements for platforms like Infinex, Soul Protocol, Magic Newton,
Novastro, Mantle, and Openledger. Maximizing allocations requires
content creation (“yaps”), platform usage, referrals, and staking,
and under‑farmed pre‑TGE leaderboards are asymmetric
opportunities. There are also ongoing monthly token and USD rewards
from protocols such as Sei, Multiplier, Polkadot, and DYDX.

 BUILDING COLLECTIVE-INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Building collective‑intelligence networks applies Bitcoin's model
of global resource coordination to AI by ensuring each new node adds
compute (horizontal scaling), produces value that exceeds individual
contributions (emergent outputs), remains reliable through
cryptographic proofs (verifiable fault tolerance), and aligns
participants via token incentives. Specialized decentralized training,
data generation, and swarms of AI agents can compound capabilities as
more resources join. Fault tolerance is guaranteed by on‑chain
verification of work, while mission‑aligned tokens bootstrap and
sustain the network. This approach promises open, scalable AI systems
that rival centralized labs by crowd‑securing intelligence rather
than money. 

 BERACHAIN SEES CAPITAL FLIGHT (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Berachain is experiencing sharp net outflows as liquidity migrates
away following the end of emissions and reward programs. Despite
strong TVL in top pools like BYUSD/HONEY and WETH/beraETH, the chain
now leads in weekly outflows among major networks, highlighting the
difficulty of retaining capital and activity when incentives dry up.

hearing tied to the ongoing Libra investigation, prompting the
presiding judge to order the unsealing of his and others' bank
records.
