MARKETS & BUSINESS

 COINBASE CONSIDERING APPLYING FOR US BANKING LICENSE (4 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Coinbase is considering applying for a U.S. federal bank charter,
which could allow it to operate more like a traditional bank that
offers services such as deposits and lending. This move comes as U.S.
regulators adopt a more favorable stance toward stablecoin regulation.
Evolving legislation like the STABLE and GENIUS Acts potentially paves
the way for clearer legal frameworks and improved oversight for
crypto-related financial institutions. 

 METAPLANET CEO DEFENDS BITCOIN TREASURY STRATEGY (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Metaplanet's CEO defended the company's strategy of holding Bitcoin
on its balance sheet, arguing that it is prioritizing long-term
corporate value creation over short-term share stock performance. The
company uses key indicators like “BTC Gain” (the unrealized
Bitcoin-denominated gain on equity) as key internal metrics, which may
better reflect strategic progress than fiat-based stock performance.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BOLT'S SUPERAPP TAKING ON COINBASE, ZELLE, AND PAYPAL (10 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Ryan Breslow has returned as the CEO of checkout company Bolt and
plans to launch a superapp with one-click crypto trading, peer-to-peer
payments, and debit card rewards. The app will offer real-time onchain
balances, single-click remittances, and a 3-7% cash back debit card.
Despite flat ARR and past investor lawsuits, Bolt has grown its
shopper network from 10 million to 80 million and plans to monetize
through interchange fees and crypto transaction charges. 

 YIELD BASIS: DEFI'S ‘BITCOIN BLACK HOLE' (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Yield Basis, a new protocol from Curve founder Michael Egorov, uses a
leverage mechanism with automated AMM rebalancing to eliminate LP
impermanent loss to ensure that liquidity providers' BTC-denominated
holdings never shrink during market moves. Liquidity providers choose
between earning real BTC trading fees or receiving emissions of the YB
token, which can be locked for governance and yield capture,
effectively turning emissions into mining with intrinsic cost. Egorov
plans chain-specific deployments, each with its own YB token, to avoid
bridging and align with local ecosystems. Yield Basis aims to launch
on the Ethereum mainnet once audited.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 10 TOP EARLY-STAGE PROTOCOLS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 These ten under-the-radar protocols span DeFi yield optimizers on
emerging chains (Burve.fi on Berachain and Hubble on Sonic), BTCFi
layers (Optimex), and institutional settlement rails (Converge).
Several projects have medium-to-high airdrop potential via testnet
tokens or early user incentives, while others focus on core crypto x
AI or open-source tooling without native tokens. Privacy-preserving
DeSci (MonadicDNA) and DeAI interfaces (Splenium and Metadrip) reflect
the growing intersection of blockchain and AI. 

 REJECT MARKETING, RETURN TO LOREBUILDING (20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto has stalled culturally due to superficial marketing replacing
deeper “lorebuilding,” a participatory narrative practice that
evolves through community contributions and shared myths, moving
beyond shallow slogans. Effective lore emerges when individuals
progress from initial attention to emotional investment and active
co-creation. Bitcoin and Ethereum illustrate this process through
foundational myths and layered community memes, while modern marketing
campaigns chase short-term metrics at the expense of cultural
cohesion. Reviving lorebuilding requires authentic, collaborative
storytelling and is essential to attracting new participants and
sustaining long-term growth.

 BITCOIN MINING FIRMS TRY TO GAME U.S. CUSTOMS CONTROLS (13 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Some U.S.-based bitcoin mining firms are allegedly underreporting the
value of imported ASIC mining rigs to avoid customs duties, a practice
that's becoming riskier because of tighter scrutiny from U.S. Customs
and the Trump administration's new tariff policy targeting Southeast
Asian imports. Increased enforcement is disrupting shipments and
prompting miners to rethink logistics, with some considering moving
operations to countries like Canada to avoid regulatory uncertainty
and rising costs. 

 HOW STABLECOINS PROFIT FROM U.S. DEBT & INTEREST RATES (40 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Stablecoins like USDT and USDC generate revenue by investing their
dollar-backed reserves in interest-bearing instruments like US
treasuries, making their profitability highly sensitive to interest
rates. Algorithmic and delta-neutral models like USDe derive income
from crypto-native mechanisms like funding-rate arbitrage and staking,
which show weaker correlation to traditional rate cycles. In a 0%
interest scenario, treasury-backed assets face severe revenue
compression unless they diversify into alternative assets or products,
whereas algorithmic protocols could maintain or boost yields through
increased market leverage.

 The European Central Bank is concerned that President Trump's
pro-crypto stance could trigger financial contagion in Europe, arguing
that U.S. stablecoin laws might weaken EU safeguards under MiCA.

percentage, doubling the next-highest opBNB at 104.5M.
