 HUMANITY PROTOCOL PARTNERS WITH MASTERCARD TO ONBOARD USERS WITHOUT
INVASIVE KYC (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Crypto was meant to be about privacy. If users need to upload pay
stubs or bank statements before making transactions, many simply won't
onboard.

A new update to Humanity Protocol layer aims to solves this. By
integrating Mastercard's open finance technology [4] into Human ID,
their palm-scan identity verification system, Humanity Protocol now
enables users to prove financial claims to lenders and apps without
sharing actual data [4].

BUILDING IN CRYPTO? Use this integration to give users access to both
DeFi and traditional financial services (credit, loans) without
forcing them through invasive KYC every time. The credentials are
owned by users, not stored by companies.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN CONTINUES RISK OF DERAILING CRYPTO BILL (6 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The US government shutdown reached a record 36 days on Wednesday,
potentially delaying budget dealmaking and further pushing out crypto
market structure legislation. Policy experts predict that a markup by
Thanksgiving remains possible, but passage by the end of 2025 is
unlikely, with legislation more likely moving through both houses by
the end of 2026, as furloughed government experts leave fewer people
capable of crafting legislative language. Patrick Witt, White House
executive director of the President's Council of Advisors for Digital
Assets, maintains optimism that Trump still wants the bill by end of
2025 and argued the shutdown paradoxically helped by allowing more
time to engage lawmakers on substance "in a way that we might not have
otherwise been able to, had there been a bunch of other competing
priorities." 

 RLUSD TO POWER MASTERCARD SETTLEMENTS ON XRP LEDGER (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Ripple partnered with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini to pilot RLUSD
stablecoin settlement for credit card transactions on the XRP Ledger,
potentially marking the first time a regulated US bank settles fiat
card payments via stablecoin on a public blockchain. RLUSD launched in
December 2024 under a New York Trust Charter with full cash backing
and surpassed $1 billion in circulation, aiming to replace traditional
1-3 day settlement rails with near-instant blockchain settlement while
maintaining compliance. WebBank, issuer of the Gemini Credit Card,
will explore settling Mastercard transactions using RLUSD, with
onboarding beginning in the coming months, pending regulatory
approvals.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 MONAD SETS NOV. 24 FOR MAINNET LAUNCH AND MON AIRDROP (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Monad will officially launch its Layer 1 blockchain and native MON
token on November 24 at 9 AM ET, marking one of the most anticipated
network debuts of the year. The launch includes a massive airdrop
designed to reward thousands of early community members and ~225,000
verified users across major crypto protocols, including Aave, Uniswap,
Hyperliquid, Morpho, Pump.fun, and Virtuals, as well as long-term NFT
holders and DAO participants. 

 ETHEREUM ECOSYSTEM HITS 19,000 TPS AS ZK ROLLUPS GO LIVE (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Ethereum's ecosystem just reached a record 19,083 transactions per
second (TPS), driven primarily by high-performance ZK rollups like
Lighter, which alone contributed 4,782 TPS. Other major contributors
include Base (139.8 TPS), Arbitrum (75 TPS), and Unichain (35.7 TPS),
bringing total live throughput to over 5,100 TPS at press time. What
was once dismissed as “ETH maxi fantasy” - scalable, secure ZK
rollups - is now a reality in production, marking the arrival of
Ethereum's high-throughput era.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MICA, TRAVEL RULE, GENIUS ACT, CLARITY ACT… WHAT COMES NEXT FOR
CRYPTO KYC? (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Crypto is finally getting the legitimacy it deserves, but regulations
are fragmenting, not converging [9]. That means one-off KYC flows
don't cut it anymore. This GUIDE BY PERSONA is for people who got into
crypto to change the financial system — and want compliance to
accelerate rather than slow down that vision. Download the eBook [9]. 

 ASYMMETRY IN CRYPTO (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Asymmetric outcomes in crypto are disappearing due to four structural
problems - 90%+ of assets are speculative with no compounding, October
10's $40 billion in OI liquidations exposed market structure risks
deterring institutions, daily token launches fragment liquidity, and
high launch valuations price perfection - leaving minimal upside for
public market investors. The optimal strategy is no longer narrative
chasing, but instead new asymmetric plays: farming, acquiring equity
stakes in blockchain-enabled businesses, buying exchange tokens as the
"only investable assets" positioned for power-law returns, and gem
hunting for dirt-cheap assets with genuine value accrual mechanisms.
Everyone knows the current meta is broken, but they continue repeating
failed strategies. True asymmetry now requires completely different
positioning than the crowd. 

 EMERGENCE: LET A BILLION APIS COMPOSE (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Agentic emergence requires the long tail of APIs with x402 that
enable LLMs to compose thousands to billions of addressable, payable
building blocks. Current bottlenecks include human-gated API keys and
billing that force platforms like OpenAI to curate a few integrations
while ignoring the long tail, but x402's protocol for attaching
stablecoin payments to any web request removes this constraint by
letting intelligence do the composition instead of developers writing
glue code. Merit Systems is building three components to foster
emergence: The Terminal (turns open-source TODOs into funded work),
Echo (model router with user-pays metering), and x402/x402scan
(standard for addressing/paying web resources plus discovery index),
with ecosystem support from Coinbase, Cloudflare, Vercel, Visa, and
Stripe.

 OPENFX HITS $34B TPV AS CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS SURGE (2 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 OpenFX has reached an annualized $34B in total payments volume (TPV)
after adding $14B in October alone, more than its previous five months
combined. The firm's rapid growth is fueled by its Latin American
expansion, including corridors in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and
Colombia, where 86% of transactions now settle in under 10 minutes
despite volatile FX and regulatory conditions. OpenFX distinguishes
its platform from “instant settlement” competitors by proving real
institutional-scale settlements in minutes, not hours. Next, the
company is expanding into Southeast Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and
the Philippines) in Q1 2026, applying its deep liquidity, local rail
integrations, and automated treasury model. 

 SOLANA'S VALIDATOR COUNT FALLS SHARPLY AS ETHEREUM EXPANDS (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Solana's validator count has dropped over 60%, falling from roughly
2,500 in early 2023 to under 900 today, raising fresh concerns about
the network's decentralization and security. The decline, down 33%
year-to-date, reflects rising hardware costs, high bandwidth demands,
and limited economic incentives for smaller validators. In contrast,
Ethereum continues to grow its validator base, now nearing 1 million
active validators, securing billions in real economic activity and
attracting new entrants daily. While some chains scale by compromising
decentralization, Ethereum's modular architecture allows it to scale
through L2s without sacrificing security, reinforcing its position as
the world's trusted settlement layer.

 LIGHTER PUSHES ETHEREUM TOWARD 350K TPS SETTLEMENT CAPACITY (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Ethereum's leading high-performance ZK rollup consumes just 1.46
bytes of blobspace per transaction, meaning it could theoretically
settle 45,000 TPS on Ethereum today.
