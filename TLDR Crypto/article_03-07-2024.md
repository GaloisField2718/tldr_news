 ROBINHOOD CRYPTO NOW AVAILABLE IN ALL 50 U.S. STATES (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Robinhood Crypto has expanded its availability to all U.S. states,
including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, giving users across
all territories the ability to trade 15 different crypto assets (e.g.,
BTC, ETH, etc.). This expansion was facilitated by regulatory
adaptations (e.g., the Hawai'i-specific MTL license is no longer
required) and additional licensing. Robinhood is now well positioned
to be ahead or already ahead of U.S.-based competitors like Coinbase
and Kraken in terms of geographical availability.

 BLOBSTREAM ZERO: A NEW-GENERATION ZKVM-BASED BLOBSTREAM BRIDGE (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 RISC Zero has collaborated with Celestia to create Blobstream Zero,
which bridges Celestia's DA layer to other prominent chains. It allows
modular apps to access ZK Coprocessors, meaning there can be
data-intensive ZK programs on chains like Ethereum and Solana but
enabled by Celestia and RISC Zero. It also allows for apps to prove
and verify Celestia DA on any chain, effectively bridging Celestia DA
to the rest of the crypto ecosystem.

 A DEEP DIVE INTO THE LIGHTING NETWORK (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Lightning Network operates as an L2 protocol on top of the
Bitcoin network, permitting faster, low-cost transactions through
private, secure channels between nodes without the need for
broadcasting on the main blockchain. This network improves Bitcoin's
functionality by allowing immediate settlements and reduced
transaction fees through a system of bilateral payment channels and
commitment transactions, improving Bitcoin's utility for everyday
transactions.

and autonomous onchain artists. The post concludes by highlighting
