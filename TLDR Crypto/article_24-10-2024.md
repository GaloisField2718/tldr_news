 FORMER CELSIUS CEO TO RETURN TO COURT ON NOV. 13 (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky will return to court on November 13
to address his motion to dismiss fraud and market manipulation
charges. Mashinsky faces multiple felony counts related to
manipulating the price of Celsius' CEL token. He will also have a
pretrial conference on January 16, with his jury trial set to begin on
January 28. His co-defendant Roni Cohen-Pavon has pleaded guilty and
will be sentenced on December 11. 

 BITCOIN BOUNCES BACK ABOVE $67,000 AS TRADERS NAVIGATE A ‘LIQUIDITY
HUNT' POST-SURGE (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin has stabilized around $67,500 after a brief dip to $65,000,
with analysts attributing the recent pullback to a “liquidity
hunt” following last week's surge near all-time highs. Market
experts expect Bitcoin to retest $70,000 resistance, with volatility
anticipated around the November 5 presidential election. Other factors
impacting price could be the Non-Farm Payroll data on November 1. A
break above $71,000 could occur after the election.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 UNISWAP INTEGRATES ACROSS FOR IN-APP BRIDGING (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Uniswap has partnered with Across Protocol to bring bridging directly
to the Uniswap interface. It will initially support 9 EVM chains with
native assets, stablecoins, and WBTC. Uniswap and Across also
co-authored ERC-7683 to standardize cross-chain Intent-based
interactions. This ERC will increase the speed and simplicity of
cross-chain transactions. 

 PRACTICAL ENDGAME ON ISSUANCE POLICY (40 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This comprehensive proposal outlines two potential approaches to
Ethereum's long-term issuance policy. The first is a “hard
endgame” that caps stake growth through negative infinity yields as
stake increases, and the second is a more viable endgame that
maintains positive yields while probabilistically limiting stake
growth. The proposal recommendeds to set a maximum issuance of 0.5% of
circulating supply annually with reward curves that maintain solo
staker viability. It notes the importance of considering and burning
MEV to achieve optimal outcomes.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 UNDERSTANDING PARALLELIZATION (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Solana's use of parallelization in both transaction processing and
block propagation increases throughput as it successfully
simultaneously runs multiple processes. This method was not commonly
used in earlier blockchains like Ethereum. Solana achieves efficiency
by requiring transactions to specify which blockchain resources they
access, while other blockchains like Ethereum use “optimistic
parallelization”, which processes everything in parallel and
addresses conflicts afterward. 

 CRYPTO'S ROLE IN THE AI REVOLUTION (30 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There has been a pivotal shift between AI and crypto, where
blockchain is emerging as essential infrastructure for AI development
rather than merely a speculative proxy. Major apps are increasingly
verticalizing by launching their own chains. There has been
significant progress in token value accrual mechanisms, and AI agents
beginning to demonstrate real economic activity on blockchain
networks.

 POSSIBLE FUTURES OF THE ETHEREUM PROTOCOL, PART 3: THE SCOURGE (35
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Scourge tackles the centralization risks present in block
construction and staking economics. Proposals for block construction
include implementing inclusion lists and encrypted mempools to reduce
builder centralization, which is currently dominated by two actors
controlling 88% of blocks. With 30% of ETH supply staked, developers
are considering mechanisms to prevent over-staking, including adjusted
issuance curves. The proposals aim to balance decentralization with
economic incentives. 

 WHY CONSUMER CRYPTO COMPLETELY SCREWED UP (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto's fundamental misstep in 2021 was attempting to create
artificial scarcity in digital goods, which directly opposed the
Internet's trend toward democratization and abundance. Music NFTs
attempted to monetize digital content when historical trends showed
the value of experiences over assets. More successful approaches align
with Internet principles by focusing on democratizing experiences and
disintermediating middlemen.

 POLYMARKET ELECTIONS AREN'T INEFFECTIVE EVEN THOUGH USERS ARE NOT
BASED IN THE US (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The claim that Polymarket odds are meaningless as users are located
outside the U.S. is misleading.
