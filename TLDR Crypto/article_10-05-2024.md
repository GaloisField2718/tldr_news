MARKETS & BUSINESS

 ROBINHOOD MET SEC 16 TIMES (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Robinhood received a Wells Notice from the SEC indicating the SEC
will proceed with civil enforcement despite meeting with the SEC 16
times to discuss registering as a special purpose broker-dealer for
crypto assets. Vlad Tenev, Robinhood's CEO, criticized the SEC's
approach as "regulation by enforcement" and emphasized the importance
of defending both Robinhood's position and customer's right to access
crypto. 

 BINANCE PLEDGED TO THWART SUSPICIOUS TRADING - UNTIL IT INVOLVED A
LAMBORGHINI-LOVING HIGH ROLLER (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Binance's market surveillance team, hired to prevent manipulative
trading, found that VIP customers like DWF Labs engaged in
pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading. The team also discovered that
Binance maintained secret internal trading accounts. After these
findings, Binance fired the investigator and kept DWF Labs as a
client. The SEC has accused Binance of misleading U.S. investors about
its risk controls.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 OCTANE: PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZED EVM FRAMEWORK (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Octane is an open-source, modular implementation of the EVM designed
to simplify the integration of the EVM into any blockchain
application. By incorporating technology from Cosmos and Ethereum, it
is capable of sub-second finality, low query latencies, and high
transaction throughput. It will be used for creating Layer 1 networks
and decentralized sequencers for L2s. 

 ORB LABS LAUNCHES ORBY (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Orb Labs has launched Orby, a chain abstraction provider that
simplifies interactions across different blockchains by unifying user
accounts and assets, enabling transactions on any chain. Orby provides
two main tools: OrbyEngine, a Smart RPC endpoint for connecting and
managing accounts across chains, and OrbyKit, an SDK that allows dapps
to provide their users with a chain-agnostic experience regardless of
which wallet is being used.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 VITALIK ON MULTI-DIMENSIONAL GAS PRICING (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Vitalik Buterin discusses how Ethereum has traditionally used gas to
manage computational resources (computation, storage, data
transmission, and cryptographic proof generation) and represent them
as a cost metric. He argues that this approach has some limitations
given it doesn't effectively describe the limits of each computational
resource. By shifting towards a "multi-dimensional gas system",
Ethereum will be able to better align costs with the actual demands
and capacities of these computational resources. 

 REAL-WORLD ASSET PROJECTS TO KEEP AN EYE ON (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 RWA tokens reached an all-time high market capitalization of $2.7
billion in February and are expected to grow as BlackRock, Franklin
Templeton, and Tether join the narrative. Though stablecoins are the
biggest RWA sector, others like commodities, equities, and stocks are
beginning to be released. Onchain private credit has already seen $4.4
billion in tokenized loans through protocols like Centrifuge, Maple,
and Goldfinch. Real estate tokenization, spearheaded by Parcl and
RealT, simplifies property fractionalization and property acquisition.
