 Blur‚Äôs Blast L2 launched last week and has attracted approximately
$390 million into its contract - about $340 million in ether and $50
million in stablecoins. While it was marketed as an L2, for now,
it‚Äôs simply a bridge to a contract created by the team and secured
with a 3 of 5 multisig. To add to the uncertainty many in the space
have about it, it‚Äôs unclear if each of the five keys was created by
individual entities or people, and the deposited funds cannot be
withdrawn until February 2024.
