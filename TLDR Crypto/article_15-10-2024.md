MARKETS & BUSINESS

 UK, COLOMBIA CRYPTO EXCHANGES LINKED IN TD BANK RECORD FINE (4 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 TD Bank has agreed to pay over $3B in fines and accept growth
limitations in the U.S., settling allegations of inadequate money
laundering monitoring involving over $1B in transactions linked to
unnamed crypto firms in the UK and Colombia. The Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network (FinCEN) highlighted that these transactions
predominantly involved crypto trading in high-risk jurisdictions. 

 DEUTSCHE BANK TO PROVIDE FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES FOR CRYPTO
MARKET-MAKING FIRM KEYROCK (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Deutsche Bank is set to provide multi-currency accounts and foreign
exchange services to Brussels-based crypto market-making firm Keyrock.
This would improve Keyrock's ability to manage and expand its
market-making and OTC trading services. The partnership is part of
Deutsche Bank's broader engagement with the digital asset sector and
will enable Keyrock to reduce risks associated with counterparty
dealings and settlements.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 POSSIBLE FUTURES OF THE ETHEREUM PROTOCOL, PART 1: THE MERGE (45
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ethereum's Merge transitioned the protocol from proof of work to
proof of stake, significantly improving stability and performance
while minimizing centralization risks. In this post, Vitalik Buterin
discusses ongoing improvements in this post around economic finality,
increasing accessibility for smaller validators, and addressing
economic centralization. The roadmap post-Merge includes categories
like technical improvements and economic adjustments aimed at
preserving Ethereum's decentralization. This involves balancing
scalability and security and striving to streamline the transaction
verification process while broadening participation among validators. 

 HYPERLIQUID'S HYPER FOUNDATION ANNOUNCED (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hyperliquid, one of the most popular perp DEX L1s, has launched the
Hyper Foundation as the first step in decentralizing its governance.
The HYPE token will launch in the coming months and play a pivotal
role in consensus and the launch of the HyperEVM. Users can now
register to claim HYPE based on their Hyperliquid points and collect a
genesis NFT.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ETHENA: THE TRILLION DOLLAR CRYPTO OPPORTUNITY (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethena's USDe has emerged as the fastest-growing stablecoin in
history, offering high yields from simplifying trades like arbitraging
Bitcoin perp funding rates. Two key catalysts - declining interest
rates and the USTb coin backed by BlackRock's reserves - could drive
further adoption. The ENA token is promising with its reduced
inflation in the coming months. 

 THE INFINITE BOOKSHELF: EIGENDA EXPLAINED (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 EigenDA, the primary Actively Validated Service on the EigenLayer
restaking platform, offers a high-throughput data availability
solution for Ethereum. It boasts 15MB/s bandwidth by separating
consensus from DA and direct communication from an operator instead of
peer-to-peer. The dual staking model, which requires operators to
stake both EIGEN and ETH, enables a more efficient and unique form of
penalization through intersubjective forking for events that are not
logically malicious but are apparent to the restakers.

 SCROLL PARTNERS WITH BINANCE (2 MINUTE READ) [10]

Tron's success in dominating the stablecoin P2P trading market in
developing countries by capturing market activity through similar
partnerships. 

 A LOOK AT POLKADOT IN 2024 (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Polkadot, once hailed as an “ETH Killer” and the fifth most
valuable crypto, has lost mindshare and developers over the past few
years. However, the protocol has continued iterating, and has recently
introduced upgrades to enhance scalability. It boasts strong
decentralization metrics and active development. While it has
struggled to meet early hype, and has received criticism for spending
nearly $100 million on marketing, legitimate projects building
Parachains could keep its vision alive.
