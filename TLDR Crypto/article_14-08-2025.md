 A16Z AND DEFI EDUCATION FUND PROPOSE SEC SAFE HARBOR FOR BLOCKCHAIN
APPS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Andreessen Horowitz and the DeFi Education Fund are urging the SEC to
establish a regulatory safe harbor for non-custodial blockchain apps
like Uniswap, Coinbase Wallet, and OpenSea. The proposed framework
would exempt apps from broker-dealer rules if they don't custody
assets, offer advice, or control user funds. The move follows dropped
investigations into key DeFi apps and aims to let U.S. developers
build without regulatory overhang. 

 SHARES OF BULLISH SOAR IN NYSE DEBUT (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish soared in its NYSE debut after
raising $1.1 billion in an IPO priced at $37 per share, well above the
expected range of $32-33. The stock opened at $90 and peaked at $118
before closing at $68, representing an 83% gain on the first day and
valuing the company at over $10 billion. Led by former NYSE President
Tom Farley and backed by Peter Thiel, Bullish focuses on institutional
investors and has processed over $1.25 trillion in trading volume
since launching in 2021.

 GRANDMAISTERS: CRYPTO AGENTS PLAYING CHESS FOR MONEY (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 GrandmAIsters is a new Solana-based AI crypto project that allows
anyone to create an AI agent to play chess for money. As the agent's
market cap increases, its chess-playing ability improves, and users
can create their agent as a custom anime character that battles other
characters. The game is now live on mainnet, and anyone can create an
agent for 0.2 SOL. 

 AAVE V4 INTRODUCES LIQUIDITY HUBS AND MODULAR LENDING (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Aave V4 re-architects DeFi lending by replacing fragmented markets
with unified “Liquidity Hubs” and modular “Spokes.” Each spoke
(Core, E-Mode, RWA, Vault, or custom) has isolated risk and draws from
a shared liquidity pool, enabling more tailored borrowing
configurations without cross-contamination. New features include
support for fixed rates, LP shares as collateral, real-world asset
integration, and institutional permissioning. The modular design
improves capital efficiency while allowing diverse risk pricing for
the same asset, like higher USDC yields in Ethena-specific spokes.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BEST NON-LEVERAGED STABLECOIN YIELDS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are over a dozen platforms offering various non-leveraged yield
opportunities, ranging from SummerFi's 8-11% base rates to Gearbox's
20% lending yields, with options including both liquid and time-locked
positions across different protocols. Most stablecoin positions should
remain unleveraged to preserve the ability to quickly enter and exit
other opportunities while still generating meaningful returns. The
strategy focuses on "sleep well" investing that beats traditional safe
assets without the complexity or risk of leveraged DeFi positions 

 H1 2025 CRYPTO TALENT INSIGHTS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Dragonfly's talent team reported extreme volatility in crypto hiring
during H1 2025, with January seeing a 60% surge in job postings before
tariff headlines in February triggered a 60% drop in applications and
record job cuts of 750 roles in March. The analysis revealed a
critical 4-6 week lag where candidates returned to the market before
companies resumed hiring, creating opportunities for teams that
maintained steady hiring plans rather than reacting to short-term
market moves. While go-to-market roles like sales and marketing
whipsawed with market sentiment, technical roles like engineering and
data science remained relatively stable throughout the downturn. The
team expects a late Q3 rebound driven by planning cycles and
regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act, positioning current hiring as
strategically advantageous for Q4.

 STRIPE'S CHAIN STRATEGY PRIORITIZES PRACTICALITY (2 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Stripe's “Tempo” blockchain reflects a broader shift as payment
giants shed reliance on third-party stablecoin infra and build their
own rails. Stripe focuses on fast, cheap, predictable settlement for
its enterprise clients. With built-in distribution across millions of
businesses, Stripe doesn't need to sell a new ecosystem, it just needs
to quietly make payments better. 

 CIRCLE'S ARC NETWORK - USDC GAS & BUILT-IN FX (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Circle's Arc Network is a permissioned blockchain optimized for
tokenized assets that offers 3-10K TPS with sub-350 ms finality. Built
on the Malachite consensus, Arc uses USDC (and eventually USYC) as
native gas and supports local stablecoin fees via embedded paymaster
abstraction. Core features include opt-in privacy with view-key
disclosures, RFQ-based FX trading, invoice-linked payments,
refund/dispute resolution, and AI-powered treasury agents. Arc bridges
seamlessly with TradFi and blockchains via CCTP, targeting enterprises
that value regulatory compliance, settlement speed, and financial
automation over decentralization.
