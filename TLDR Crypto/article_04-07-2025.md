 FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FLAGS UNCERTAIN OUTLOOK FOR CRYPTO TREASURY FIRMS
(3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Franklin Templeton analysts flagged a “dangerous” feedback loop
risk for crypto treasury firms, noting that while raising capital at a
premium to NAV and staking PoS assets offer upside, falling crypto
prices could force asset sales that depress both token and stock
prices. They emphasized that sustaining a NAV premium is critical, and
if it's lost, capital formation could stall, triggering a potential
downward spiral. With 135 public firms now holding BTC and others
focused on ETH or SOL, the success of this model hinges on managing
volatility and investor confidence. 

 ROBINHOOD CEO SAYS OPENAI AND SPACEX ‘STOCK TOKENS' ARE DERIVATIVES
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev confirmed that its new “stock tokens”
for OpenAI and SpaceX are blockchain-based derivatives, not equity,
after OpenAI objected to the offering. The tokens track the value of
private shares but don't confer ownership or rights, and are part of a
broader push to tokenize access to over 200 U.S. companies for EU
users. OpenAI warned the public that it did not authorize the tokens
and urged reliance on official filings.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 VIRTUALS AGENTIC COMMERCE PROTOCOL LIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI agent launchpad Virtuals has launched its much-anticipated Agentic
Commerce Protocol (ACP) in beta. The goal of ACP is to enable agents
to communicate with one another and leverage each other's unique tools
to fulfill requests. Virtuals notes that the protocol is still early,
and it is looking for user feedback for improvement. 

 EREBOR: A NEW BANK FOR CRYPTO (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Erebor is a new digital-only bank from Palmer Luckey (Anduril) and
Joe Lonsdale (Palantir co-founder) to fill the void left by Silicon
Valley Bank's March 2023 collapse, which had disrupted financing for
startups and crypto firms. The bank has applied for a national charter
and will serve tech businesses in AI, crypto, defense, and
manufacturing, with leadership from Circle's Jacob Hirshman. Erebor
aims to become "the most regulated entity conducting and facilitating
stablecoin transactions," positioning stablecoins as a core focus
alongside traditional banking products for both US and international
clients seeking access to the US banking system.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 EULER REBORN: A NEW ERA OF PROGRAMMABLE CREDIT (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Euler V2 introduces a modular vault infrastructure (EVK/EVC) that
enables permissionless deployment of bespoke lending markets with
cross-vault collateralization and programmable liquidation, creating a
composable credit layer akin to traditional capital markets. Its
EulerSwap feature activates idle liquidity by allowing vault assets to
serve as AMM LPs with just-in-time borrowing, sharply boosting capital
efficiency, market depth, and protocol fee generation. TVL surged from
roughly $110 million to nearly $2 billion in under a year, but most
fee switches remain off, deferring token value accrual and positioning
EUL for future monetization while capping current utility. Euler faces
stiff competition from Aave, Compound, and new entrants like Morpho,
and must rebuild trust after its 2023 exploit to sustain growth and
attract institutional capital. 

 USDC DEFI STRATEGIES (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 “USDC-in USDC-out” strategies aggregate USDC lending across
protocols, like Summer Finance's Lazy Summer (≈7.4%), srUSD (6.7%
APY), Gauntlet's USD Alpha (7.7%), Infinifi Labs' siUSD/liUSD
(8%–13.4%), and Euler frontier markets (12%–14%), to deliver
steady yields without any swapping or slippage. They combine organic
interest with native token incentives and just-in-time capital
activation through composable vault architectures. All maintain full
USDC liquidity on exit, enabling seamless redeployment for trading
opportunities, deleveraging, or expense coverage.

 QUID PRO STABLECOIN (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The U.S. government's newfound love for stablecoins is driven not by
ideology, but by a need to monetize debt without triggering market
panic. The Genius Act, SLR exemptions, and potential cessation of Fed
interest payments on reserves collectively enable TBTF banks to issue
stablecoins, freeing up to $10.1 trillion in T-bill buying power. In
this framework, stablecoins aren't about DeFi or freedom, they're a
state-sanctioned liquidity injection mechanism designed to fund
deficits, prop up equity markets, and preserve elite wealth. 

 TOKENIZATION OR DEREGULATION? (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Robinhood's push to offer tokenized exposure to private firms like
OpenAI amounts to sidestepping traditional disclosure rules. Vlad
Tenev (Robinhood CEO) argues it's illogical to restrict retail access
to private equity while allowing zero-day options or meme coins. Matt
Levine counters that letting the public buy "private" shares without
public disclosure effectively erases the distinction between public
and private companies, not by reforming IPO rules, but by discarding
them entirely.
