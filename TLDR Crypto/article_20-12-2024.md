MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS COINBASE CAN DELIST WBTC, DENYING JUSTIN
SUN-AFFILIATED BIT GLOBAL'S BID FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A federal judge has denied BiT Global's request for a temporary
restraining order against Coinbase's planning delisting of Wrapped
Bitcoin (WBTC), allowing the exchange to proceed. The ruling comes
after BiT Global, which has ties to Justin Sun and recently partnered
with former wBTC custodian BitGo, sued Coinbase for alleged unfair
competition and reputational damage related to the launch of
Coinbase's competing cbBTC token. Coinbase, which maintains it has
discretion over its listings and represents less than 1% of wBTC
trading activity, has suggested it may seek sanctions against BiT
Global and its law firm for filing what it considers a spurious
lawsuit. 

 BITCOIN MINERS MARA, HUT 8 CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE MORE BTC FOR THEIR
RESERVES (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bitcoin miners like MARA and Hut 8 have been aggressively acquiring
Bitcoin to strengthen their reserves, with MARA purchasing 15,574 BTC
for $1.53B and Hut 8 adding 990 BTC for $100M, positioning themselves
among the largest corporate Bitcoin holders. This trend reflects a
broader shift as companies, like MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms,
increasingly view Bitcoin as a reserve asset, using it to support
growth initiatives and long-term financial strategies.

access to its wallet infrastructure for scalable, secure, and
programmable money movement. These server-side wallets, designed for
enterprise-grade security and consumer-grade performance, enable
backend-controlled transaction execution, policy enforcement, and
wallet management across EVM chains, Solana, and Bitcoin. 

 STEALTH DCA IS LIVE (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 BONKbot has launched "stealth DCA," a new feature that keeps
dollar-cost averaging (DCA) orders hidden off-chain to avoid

 A TLDR OF THE ETHEREUM L1 SCALING ROADMAP (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ethereum's L1 scaling roadmap outlines a plan to increase the
network's gas limit 100x within five years, with an immediate increase
to 36 megagas per block expected soon. Key technical improvements
include the implementation of ZK provers for EVM execution, delayed
state root calculations, and multi-dimensional EIP-1559 for resource
pricing optimization. The roadmap also includes complementary upgrades
like history expiry (EIP-7639), enshrined PBS (EIP-7732), and
potential slot time reductions, all while maintaining Ethereum's
commitment to decentralization by ensuring anyone can still verify the
network without relying on third parties. 

 TOP 8 MOST INTERESTING AGENTS & AGENT DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There were numerous exciting agent launches this week, including
AgentTank launching a framework for giving agents full computer use,
with an example of an agent ordering toilet paper, and Hyperbolic
creating an agent with access to GPU compute. Notable platform
developments include Orbit's chain abstraction layer for DeFi
interactions and Thale's integration with Story protocol to allow
agents to monetize IP. Rei Network's Unit 00 agent is gaining traction
for its quantitative analysis capabilities and ability to track data
across multiple sources.

 DON'T BE AFRAID OF QUANTUM COMPUTERS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 StarkWare CEO Eli Ben-Sasson argues that while quantum computing
represents a significant threat to current cryptographic systems,
blockchain has a clear path to quantum resistance through
zero-knowledge proofs. Unlike traditional cryptographic methods,
certain ZK proofs are inherently quantum-resistant due to their
reliance on hash functions rather than finding specific values in
large mathematical spaces. The tech powering Starknet already
incorporates these proofs, though additional implementation work
remains to make the entire system quantum-resistant.

drive the convergence of Web3 and Web2. Shaikh will step into a
strategic advisor role.
