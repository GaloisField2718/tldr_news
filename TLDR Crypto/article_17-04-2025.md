MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER VOWS TO PUSH CRYPTO (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 South Korean presidential candidate Hong Joon-pyo has pledged to
aggressively reform crypto regulations to bolster the blockchain
industry. As part of a broader “disruptive tech” initiative, he
also plans to invest $35 billion over five years into AI, quantum
computing, and other advanced technologies while integrating
blockchain into public services. 

 COINBASE INSTITUTIONAL WARNS OF SIGNS THAT 'CRYPTO WINTER' IS COMING
(5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Several converging indicators, including a 41% decline in altcoin
market cap, a 50-60% drop in VC funding, and most tokens trading below
their 200DMA, suggest a new crypto winter may be underway. While
Bitcoin has been more resilient, broad market indicators like the
COIN50 clearly demonstrate bearish trends amid ongoing macroeconomic
headwinds and tariff pressures. Analysts indicate that a price floor
might be established by mid-to-late Q2, with potential for improved
market outlook in Q3.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 OKX WILL OFFICIALLY EXPAND INTO THE US (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OKX is expanding into the United States by launching its centralized
crypto trading platform and wallet product and establishing a regional
headquarters in San Jose. The expansion follows a $500 million DOJ
settlement concerning allegations of operating without appropriate
licenses. OKX is planning a phased nationwide rollout later in 2025,
including migrating users of the affiliated US-based OKCoin exchange. 

 UNISWAP V4 INCENTIVES LAUNCH ON UNICHAIN (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Uniswap v4 incentives are now live on Unichain, introducing major
improvements like near-instant confirmations, MEV protection, and
enhanced privacy for traders. With hooked pools, new interfaces, and
expansion to more chains on the way, Uniswap is aiming to bring a DEX
experience that matches centralized exchanges.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHY CRYPTO DEVELOPER ACTIVITY IS DECLINING (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto developer activity is slowing down outside core areas like
Bitcoin and stablecoins. Venture capital funding, especially in early
stage rounds, have collapsed since its 2021-22 peak after heavy losses
on speculative DeFi, NFT, and Metaverse bets, prompting most firms to
treat crypto deals with skepticism. Despite this, VCs should continue
backing crypto ventures, since long-term, slow-burn successes like
Polymarket demonstrate the value of sustained capital support. 

 $OM SELL-OFF BREAKDOWN (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A massive sell-off, triggered largely by aggressive shorting on
Binance Perps and a mystery whale dumping millions on OKX, saw $OM
(Mantra) lose 95% of its value in just hours. A deep-dive into the
event revealed clues pointing to a long-time staker possibly linked to
the chaos, suggesting the sell-off may have been more than just panic.

 MOVEMENT NETWORK'S MARKET MAKER FRAUD AND CO-FOUNDER HIATUS (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The Movement Network Foundation has initiated a third-party
investigation into “market maker abnormalities” after Binance
suspended a market maker involved in dumping approximately $38 million
MOVE tokens with little buy-side activity. Amid these irregularities,
co-founder Rushi Manche has reportedly taken a temporary leave of
absence, with indications of disrupted communications and absence from
key company events. The investigation, alongside a $38 million USDT
buyback program, are efforts to compensate affected users, though
general sentiment on the project remains low after multiple red flags.


 WHAT HAPPENS TO A BLOCKCHAIN WHEN NOBODY USES IT? (11 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 A blockchain's long-term survival hinges on active user engagement,
continuous development, and strong network incentives. Without these
developments, even the most technically advanced chains can become
ghost towns with minimal transactions and dwindling community support.
Key health metrics include transaction volume, TVL, developer
activity, and validator count.
