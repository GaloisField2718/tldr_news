DEX VOLUMES (2 MINUTE READ) [4]

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 JUPITER ANNOUNCES JUPNET (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 JupNet introduces an omnichain network that aims to aggregate all of
crypto into a single decentralized ledger for seamless user and
developer experiences across a world of a “million chains, billion
people, and trillion tokens.” Powered by its DOVE Network for
cross-chain validation and execution, an Omnichain Ledger for unified
liquidity and transactions, and Aggregated Decentralized Identity
(ADI) for on-chain account management, JupNet looks to simplify and
unify crypto interactions, enabling a global market where one account
accesses all chains, currencies, and commodities.

a Strategic SOL Reserve, and maintaining consistent trading pairs, all
while empowering builders with grants and hosting an AI Hackathon in

ecosystem across Base and Solana.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 NARRATIVE GAMES: WHAT'S THE NEXT TRADE? (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The crypto market is showing sustained strength, with Bitcoin
consolidating near $105,000, growing stablecoin supply indicating
institutional interest, and expanding total market capitalization. The
memecoin narrative appears to be reaching a potential peak after
Trump's coin, with market attention potentially shifting toward
SocialFi platforms like Clout and Yapster, while previously dismissed
“Dinocoins” (XRP, HBAR, and XLM) are showing renewed strength
through institutional adoption and regulatory positioning. The AI
narrative continues to evolve, moving from speculative agents toward
more practical DeFAI applications focused on portfolio management and
yield optimization. 

 ETHEREUM ACCELERATION (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Prominent researchers are calling for an accelerated development
process for Ethereum, arguing that the pace of roughly one protocol
update per year is insufficient for the network's continued
competitiveness and evolution. This post challenges the notion of
protocol ossification, suggesting it poses centralization risks and
could push users toward more centralized alternatives. Several
immediate opportunities for advancement include scaling improvements
for L2s, safe gas limit increases, and enhanced wallet security
through account abstraction.

 VITALIK BUTERIN ARGUES FOR INTEROPERABILITY (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vitalik Buterin asserts that Ethereum's future lies in scaling blobs,
improving security, accelerating interoperability, and optimizing the
economics of ETH to support an L2-dominated ecosystem while
maintaining innovation and unity. This approach avoids outdated L1
sharding and instead focuses on evolving Ethereum as a cohesive and
efficient platform. 

 CHANGES IN THE CRYPTO LANDSCAPE (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Solana ecosystem, with its user-friendly Phantom wallet and fast
DEXs, surpasses competitors like MetaMask in consumer appeal. Recent
developments, including Trump's meme coin and SOL/XRP ETF
applications, highlight a shift away from Bitcoin maximalism.

QUICK LINKS

 DIFFICULT TO PICK TOKENS (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The oversupply of tokens and increasing competition mean “alt
seasons” will be shorter and rarer, requiring investors to adjust
expectations and portfolios, as picking winning tokens has become as
challenging as selecting outperforming stocks amidst the AI-driven
market shift. 

 COINBASE COULD BE CRYPTO'S AMAZON (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 As tokenization grows, Coinbase is poised to become crypto's
“Amazon,” while boutique exchanges like meme coin, AI, and NFT
marketplaces will emerge as the “Gucci” equivalents, offering
specialized experiences built on DEX rails. 

 COINBASE ENABLES YOU TO ACCEPT PAYMENTS FROM AI AGENTS (1 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Businesses can prepare for the future by accepting payments from AI
agents, as AI-driven orders are expected to pass standard,
user-interface orders in the coming years. 

 IT'S EASIER THAN YOU THINK TO BUILD WITH AI AND WEB3 (2 MINUTE READ)
