 ROBINHOOD TO BUY CRYPTO EXCHANGE BITSTAMP IN EFFORT TO EXPAND OUTSIDE
THE U.S. (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Robinhood has announced Robinhood Crypto's worldwide expansion with
the acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp. The U.K.-based exchange,
one of the biggest in Europe, was sold for $200 million cash and is
expected to close in the first half of 2025. Robinhood hopes this
purchase will help them attract institutional customers.

[5] 

 Crypto exchange Kraken is looking to raise more than $100 million as
part of plans to go public in the United States. Rumors have been
circulating about Kraken's plans to go public for the past few years,
but the firm has recently been fighting accusations from the SEC about
operating an unregistered brokerage. The round could be completed by
the end of the year.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PRIORITY IS ALL YOU NEED: MEV TAXES (24 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 MEV taxes allow apps to capture their MEV without sacrificing
composability. By charging a fee as a function of the priority fee of
a transaction, smart contracts can capture a variable percentage of
MEV. This strategy can only be used on OP Stack L2s at the moment as
it relies on a block building algorithm sorting by priority fee. 

 ALCHEMY INTRODUCES ROLLUP PLATFORM (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Infrastructure provider Alchemy has announced its Rollup platform,
which offers developers a 99.999% uptime sequencer and all-in-one
toolkit. It supports Arbitrum Orbit, OP Stack, and Celestia DA
modularity options.

 MULTICOIN DISCUSSES ‚ÄúTHE ENDGAME FOR STABLECOINS‚Äù (9 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Mountain Protocol has launched USDM, a stablecoin backed by US
Treasuries. The protocol uses an auto-rebasing feature that accrues
daily yield directly in users' wallets, differentiating it from
competitors by sharing the yield generated from treasury assets, thus
enhancing its appeal as a reliable and innovative financial tool in
the stablecoin market. 

 MAXIMIZING YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING A CRYPTO VC ROLE (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Regan Bozman narrates his journey from exploring operator funds to
co-founding Free Company, a syndicate that successfully invested in
various crypto projects during the 2020-2021 bull market. Despite
initial success, changes in member finances and the market led to the
dissolution of the syndicate, prompting Bozman to co-found Lattice, a
$20M fund that made significant investments in the crypto space.

 POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS OF ROBINHOOD'S BITSTAMP ACQUISITION (1 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Robinhood is aggressively expanding its cryptocurrency services and
offerings. It most recently acquired BitStamp (daily volume of $196
million and 1.2 million monthly active users) for $200 million. This
strategic move, along with Robinhood's 263% month-over-month growth in
crypto volumes, positions Robinhood to potentially surpass its equity
trading volumes with crypto. The acquisition also enables Robinhood to
potentially increase its Assets Under Custody to approximately $30
billion and expand its trading options to match the token pairs
offered by BitStamp. 

 ZK IS STILL UNDERHYPED (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ZK and verifiable compute is a new developer primitive that could
introduce exciting new applications, much like how the iPhone's camera
and GPS led to innovative applications like Instagram, Uber, and
Doordash. DeFi protocols could integrate risk modeling in ZK and
complex offchain pricing functions that are trustlessly verifiable
onchain. Blockchain and ZK could enable ownable, censorship-resistant
AI companions and agents or onchain ML.
