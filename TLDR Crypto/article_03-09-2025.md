MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC, CFTC CLEAR REGISTERED FIRMS' TRADING OF SPOT CRYPTO (7 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The SEC and CFTC issued a joint statement clarifying that registered
venues – designated contract markets (DCMs), foreign board of trade
(FBOTs), and SEC-registered national securities exchanges (NSEs) –
can facilitate trading of certain spot crypto asset products and
should engage staff on implementation details. Positioned under the
SEC's “Project Crypto” and the CFTC's “crypto sprint,” this is
a shift toward integrating spot crypto markets into existing
regulatory frameworks ahead of Congress's market-structure
legislation. While no specific assets were named, the agencies
emphasized applying fair and orderly market principles and addressing
prior gaps in oversight. If sustained, this coordination could
accelerate institutional participation and expand regulated access to
crypto spot trading in the US. 

 BENCHMARK DEFENDS STRATEGY'S EQUITY SALES, EYES S&P 500 POTENTIAL (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Benchmark has defended Strategy's decision to relax its equity
issuance constraints, arguing the move was a rational correction to
sustain Bitcoin accumulation. Strategy recently purchased another
4,048 BTC, funded through common and preferred stock sales, lifting
its holdings to 636,505 BTC.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 KITE: THE BASE LAYER FOR THE AGENTIC INTERNET (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Kite is building foundational trust infrastructure enabling AI agents
to operate autonomously online through identity, governance, and
payment systems. Kite Agent Identity Resolution (Kite AIR) features
Agent Passport for verifiable identity and Agent App Store for service
discovery, utilizing stablecoins, cryptographic attestations, and
smart contract governance. The platform is already live on Shopify and
PayPal, allowing AI shopping agents to authenticate and settle
purchases on-chain using stablecoins. Kite aims to build the essential
machine-to-machine economy infrastructure, as AI agents are expected
to drive increasing portions of internet traffic. 

 COINBASE LAUNCHES FUTURES TRADING FOR INDEX MAGIC 7, COIN, & CRYPTO
ETFS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Coinbase is set to launch “Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures” on
September 22, offering exposure to a mix of top tech stocks and
BlackRock's Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The index evenly weights 10
components, including Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Tesla, Google,
Amazon, Coinbase shares, and the two crypto ETFs. The move follows
declining spot trading activity and reflects Coinbase's push to blend
traditional equities with digital asset products.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 REGULATORY ROULETTE: STABLECOINS AND OPEN FINANCE (18 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Despite federal regulators promoting cryptocurrency and fintech
innovation through speeches and new legislation like the GENIUS Act,
banks remain hesitant to engage meaningfully with stablecoin companies
due to examination pressure and regulatory uncertainty at the ground
level. The disconnect between policy optimism and examiner reality has
created an 18+ month delay for banks seeking to enter stablecoin
markets, as rulemaking for the GENIUS Act could follow the same
protracted timeline as Dodd-Frank's Section 1033, which took 15 years
and is still not fully implemented. Past regulatory backlash following
failures like Silicon Valley Bank and Synapse has made examiners more
risk-averse, creating a "regulatory roulette" where companies face
unpredictable examination outcomes depending on individual examiner
expertise and state-level regulatory approaches. Companies operating
in this environment are building comprehensive compliance frameworks
proactively, treating strict regulatory requirements as already in
effect to demonstrate good faith and prepare for eventual rule clarity
while navigating fragile banking relationships. 

 THE ONLY SAFE WAY TO STORE CRYPTO (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Paper or metal wallets are the most secure storage options when
combined with offline private key generation using natural entropy
sources rather than predictable methods. Brain wallets are vulnerable
to cracking tools that monitor common phrases and patterns, and online
paper wallet generators are often scams designed to steal funds. For
hardware wallets, purchase directly from manufacturers, use BIP39
passphrases for additional security layers, and implement
multi-signature solutions with proper key segregation and cycling
practices. Security levels should match threat models, with air-gapped
systems and offline key generation being essential for truly large
amounts. Most users will find hardware wallets sufficient for typical
holdings.

 THE CASE FOR RESTAKING ON HYPERLIQUID (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Hyperliquid should introduce a restaking framework that transforms
the platform from a single exchange into permissionless financial
infrastructure, where pooled HYPE capital can underwrite bridges,
perpetual markets, oracles, and other services while earning revenue.
The system would allow for new primitives through HIP-1/HIP-2 (spot
assets and bridges) and HIP-3 (permissionless perpetual deployment
requiring 1 million HYPE staked), with restaking allowing multiple
participants to pool capital and share fees rather than requiring
individual whales. Early revenue projections suggest restakers could
earn additional yields of 3-18% APY on top of base HYPE staking
rewards, depending on trading volume and fee splits across deployed
services. This "Consensus Capital Markets" model creates a shared
security infrastructure that enables novel DeFi applications,
including undercollateralized lending, insurance pools, and real-world
asset tokenization, all secured by the same staked validator set. 

 STABLECOIN INFRASTRUCTURE WARS (45 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Six well-funded Layer 1 blockchains – Plasma, Codex, 1Money, Arc,
Stable, and Monad – are competing to capture the rapidly growing
stablecoin infrastructure market, which is projected to reach $3.7
trillion by the end of the decade from its current $277+ billion
market cap. These specialized chains address the limitations of
general-purpose blockchains that weren't designed for
stablecoin-specific requirements like fee predictability, instant
finality, regulatory compliance, and enterprise integration, with each
taking distinct approaches ranging from USDT-native designs to
institutional-focused Layer 2 solutions. The competition is a shift
from building general-purpose blockchain infrastructure to creating
specialized financial rails, with major backing from stablecoin
issuers like Tether and Circle, exchanges like Bitfinex, and
institutional investors including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. The
winner of this "infrastructure war" could become foundational to how
digital money moves globally, as stablecoins increasingly replace
traditional payment rails for cross-border remittances, corporate
treasury management, and everyday transactions.
