 FTX'S REVISED REORGANIZATION PLAN VALUES CRYPTO CLAIMS AT TIME OF
BANKRUPTCY (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The FTX estate filed an amended Chapter 11 reorganization plan
treating cryptocurrency claims as their equivalent cash value on its
bankruptcy filing date, November 11, 2022. With the current market
recovery, this might cause creditors to lose potential gains. The
plan, requiring several approval thresholds, could potentially be
enforced even on non-agreeing creditors if it is deemed fair and
equitable. 

 SALES OF SOLANA PHONE SURGE AS TRADERS CHASE BONK ARBITRAGE (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Solana‚Äôs founder Anatoly Yakovenko was recently on a podcast with
Laura Shin to discuss the disappointing performance of the Solana Saga
Phone initiative. With sales lagging, he said the project was ‚Äòunder
internal discussions‚Äô. Then, as BONK‚Äôs price surged on the news of
its listing on Coinbase, an arbitrage opportunity arose. The first
batch of Saga phones came with a 30M BONK token claim. Originally,
this was only worth ~$10. As BONK‚Äôs price rose, these tokens were
worth up to as much as $1,000. With the price of the phone at only
$600, this created a $400 arbitrage opportunity. Within hours of the
arbitrage opportunity appearing, the remaining Saga phone supply was
sold out.
