 SWIFT TO WORK WITH CONSENSYS ON MVP FOR CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Swift announced plans to integrate a blockchain-based shared ledger
into its infrastructure, starting with 24/7 cross-border payments. The
system will be designed around a prototype developed with Consensys
and aims to enable secure, real-time settlement of tokenized value via
smart contracts while ensuring interoperability with existing systems.
Over 30 global banks, including Santander, Bank of America, BNP
Paribas, and HSBC, will participate in shaping and implementing the
ledger, with Swift positioning it as a core part of the financial
industry's digital transformation. 

 FROM SPACS TO CASH-FLOW BUYS: HOW DATS ARE GROWING (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Strive's all-stock acquisition of Semler Scientific marks the first
merger of two publicly traded bitcoin treasuries, creating a company
holding nearly 11,000 BTC and establishing "bitcoin per share" as the
key performance metric while signaling the start of a massive DAT
consolidation wave. A Wall Street banker outlined three evolution
strategies for DATs: mergers to consolidate BTC holdings and boost
bitcoin per share, cash-flow acquisitions to offset dilution and fund
ongoing bitcoin purchases, as demonstrated by Metaplanet's "phase two"
strategy, and direct business mergers instead of messy SPAC processes
that require shareholder votes and often suffer investor redemptions.
The Semler deal was particularly attractive because the company's
shares traded below its bitcoin value, effectively assigning negative
value to its medical device business, while the merger allows both
companies to access capital markets more effectively than either could
independently.

 AAVE'S PLASMA MARKET HITS $6.5B IN DEPOSITS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Aave's Plasma deployment has seen rapid growth, reaching $6.5 billion
in deposits in just three days. The increase comes as Aave leadership
pushes to consolidate focus on high-performing networks, signaling a
shift away from supporting dozens of L2s and alt-L1s with limited
traction. 

 FIREDANCER TEAM PROPOSES UNCAPPING SOLANA BLOCKS POST-ALPENGLOW (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Jump Crypto's Firedancer team has proposed removing Solana's 60M
compute unit (CU) block cap, allowing blocks to scale dynamically with
validator hardware performance after the Alpenglow upgrade. The plan
would let high-performance validators earn more by fitting more
transactions into a block, while lower-tier validators would skip
oversized blocks using Alpenglow's skip-vote mechanism. While Solana
researchers support the direction, they also flagged risks around
centralization and network stability from ultra-advanced validators.

 HOW TO READ POLYMARKET FOR INSIDER-DRIVEN ALPHA (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Spotting potential "insider" activity on Polymarket using only
on-chain data involves scanning the Breaking tab for rapid market
shifts, then analyzing the Holders and Activity tabs for large buys
from fresh wallets or clusters of small buys backing one side. For
example, the Eric Adams endorsement market saw suspicious "Yes" and
"No" activity shortly before his mayoral race dropout. Tools like
Polysights can help surface these anomalies faster. 

 MEME MARKETS ARE DYING (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Meme markets are suffering from a lack of external capital flows. The
industry had previously been propped up by new capital entering the
market and being captured by snipers and bots, though, without
inflows, the average speculator is slowly bled out by 1-3% fees.
Though the market can turn around if there's another massive Dogecoin
or Dogwifhat moment, some are concerned that prediction markets
provide a cleaner, more transparent form of onchain speculation that
could indicate the beginning of the end of memecoin speculation.

 ETHEREUM L1 VS L2S (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Layer 2 solutions are arguably draining Ethereum's fee revenue and
user base, with ETH fee revenue collapsing since EIP-4844
(Proto-Danksharding) as L2s capture transaction fees while ETH
inflation rises above the fee burn rate. The analysis claims L2s
fragment the ecosystem into competing camps, breaking liquidity and
composability without realistic reunification possibilities, while
pushing users toward centralized L2s where the top 20 solutions can
steal funds and censor transactions despite the scaling roadmap being
justified for decentralization. L2 financial dominance makes pivoting
back to L1 scaling impossible since breakthrough L1 technology would
crash L2 token and equity prices overnight by making them obsolete,
creating a vampire attack scenario where L2s steal users and fees
while pretending to be equivalent to Ethereum. 

 WHY YOU SHOULD GO TO DEVCONNECT IN BUENOS AIRES (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Ethereum's Devconnect in Buenos Aires represents a "mic drop moment"
as the first major official Ethereum event in a country where roughly
10% of citizens use crypto daily, 20% own it, and 30% live completely
bankless due to decades of inflation and capital controls driving
adoption of peer-to-peer finance. Unlike Devcon's large centralized
format, Devconnect operates as a bottom-up, emergent festival of the
Ethereum community, with this year's theme being "Ethereum World's
Fair," showcasing the technology's global impact through international
exhibitions of industry, technology, art, and culture. Argentina
offers an ideal backdrop where landing in Buenos Aires "feels like you
time-traveled 5 years forward in Ethereum adoption," while the country
provides incredible experiences from asado barbecue culture to wine
trips in Mendoza and adventure travel in Patagonia.
