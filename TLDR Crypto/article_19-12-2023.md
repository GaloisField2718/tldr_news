 WITH ALL EYES ON BITCOIN ETF DECISION, SEC KICKS ETHER CAN DOWN THE
ROAD (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The SEC has deferred its decisions on several proposed ether-focused

comments on the proposals. The SEC previously delayed a decision on
the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, but it anticipates a ruling, or an
additional delay, by February 6. Decisions on proposed spot bitcoin
ETFs by Ark Invest and 21Shares are expected by January 10.

times the two-year average. Consequently, stocks for Bitcoin mining
companies like Marathon Digital, Riot Platform, and Cleanspark
outperformed Bitcoin prices in December.

 METAPLEX INSCRIPTIONS AND ENGRAVINGS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Metaplex has announced a new standard for fully on-chain and
immutable digital assets on Solana called Metaplex Inscriptions and
Engravings. Unlike other NFTs on Solana, which often store their data
on external services, these inscriptions allow metadata and media to
be stored fully on Solana. This standard could increase both security
and composability, allowing for the creation of Solana's first truly
immutable NFTs. Both programs are now available on devnet.

security for staked assets. This development follows Celestia's
mainnet launch in the Cosmos ecosystem, which has seen TIA's value
increase by approximately 400% since October.

 MULTIPLE CONCURRENT LEADERS IN SOLANA (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post goes over the idea of Multiple Concurrent Leaders in
Solana. With two or more leadership nodes, transaction latency and
over-extraction can potentially be reduced, benefiting transaction
processing time and costs. The concept of MCL has additional
implications, such as fee and time priority execution, resource usage
balance, network forking, and so on. The aim of MCL adoption would be
to optimize Solana's network performance and reduce vulnerabilities to
manipulative actions.
