 THE WORLD INCREASINGLY RUNS ON LITHIUM. THIS COMPANY IS OFFERING
INVESTORS A CHANCE TO OWN A STAKE IN POWERING THE FUTURE (SPONSOR) [4]


 With governments and auto companies racing to switch to renewables,
electric vehicles will soon be the only cars - and almost all of them
run on lithium batteries.

Not since the invention of the steam engine has a fuel technology
promised such a globally transformative impact - and presented such an
investment opportunity [4].

U.S. DoE and General Motors-Backed EnergyX [4] has designed patented
technology [4] that can extract up to 300% more lithium than
traditional methods. Predicted to dominate extraction in the near
future, huge excitement has surrounded the launch of their most recent
open-to-the-public investment round. [4]

This century will be defined by lithium. Don't miss your chance to
invest in the future. [4]
