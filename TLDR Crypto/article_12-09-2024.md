‚Äî becomes operationally complex due to issues with tracing, RPCs,

 ETHEREUM'S IDENTITY CRISIS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Ethereum revenue has dropped 99% year-to-date, challenging the
‚Äúultrasound money‚Äù narrative that relies on fee burning for value
accrual. The activity shift to L2 solutions has reduced fees and MEV
revenue for the base layer, while the L2s retain most of the execution
fees and sequencing rewards. Though some now advocate for its role as
‚Äúprogrammatic money,‚Äù this stance faces competition from
stablecoins and the potential abstraction of ETH as a gas token on
L2s. 

 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN EVERY TOKEN GETS RESTAKED? (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 With restaking protocols like EigenLayer and Symbiotic expanding
beyond ETH, new supply-demand dynamics are unfolding where
yield-seeking behavior drives supply. However, the demand side faces
challenges in justifying the use of restaked assets over native
tokens. Restaking is a complementary feature, offering insurance and
enhancement rather than core economic security. Developers will likely
choose restaked assets based on functionality and ecosystem alignment.
