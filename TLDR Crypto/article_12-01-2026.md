MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO MARKET STRUCTURE BILLS THIS WEEK (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Both the Senate Banking and Senate Agriculture Committees have
scheduled markup sessions for January 15 to review their respective
crypto market structure bills – a critical procedural step where
members debate, propose amendments, and vote on advancement. If both
bills advance, they would be reconciled into a unified Senate package,
sent to the Senate floor, then reconciled with the House-passed
CLARITY Act before final votes and presidential signature. Unresolved
issues include Americans' rights to earn stablecoin rewards, DeFi
sanctions screening requirements at the UI level, and self-custody
protections. Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott set January 15 as a
firm deadline. Kalshi prediction markets currently assign a 45%
probability of passage before May and 66% before 2027. 

 UK CHAIRS PUSH TO BAN CRYPTO POLITICAL DONATIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Seven Labour MPs who chair parliamentary committees urged the
government to ban cryptocurrency political donations in the upcoming
Elections Bill. They believe crypto can obscure fund sources, enable
thousands of micro-donations below disclosure thresholds, and raise
the risk of foreign interference. The intervention piles pressure on
Labour after Reform UK began accepting crypto and comes as the UK
tightens its broader crypto regulatory framework.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 EIP-8004: ROAD TO MAINNET (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 EIP-8004 proposes establishing Ethereum as a coordination layer for
autonomous AI agents through three on-chain registries: identity for
agent identification, reputation for tracking behavioral history and
trustworthiness, and validation for verifying capabilities and
permissions. The specification has progressed from v0.4 to v1.0 as it
matures with community input. This standard would enable agents to
transact and coordinate with verifiable credentials and reputation
systems built directly into Ethereum's base layer. 

 ONCHAIN NEOBANKS TO WATCH IN 2026 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Onchain neobanks combine DeFi functionality with traditional banking
UX while maintaining self-custody, differentiating from custodial
solutions like Coinbase. Three leaders are gaining traction: Superform
($144M TVL and 300% growth since mid-2025) focuses on automated
cross-chain yield aggregation across 7+ chains, Veera targets emerging
markets with 4M+ users across 108 countries and plans Q1 2026 physical
card launch, and Tria leads chain abstraction with 150K users
generating $1M daily spend and ~$20M ARR through its invisible
multi-chain infrastructure.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 PAYMENT TOKENIZATION ISN'T ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are three distinct payment token types: network tokens
(Visa/Mastercard, best for recurring payments), Payment service
provider tokens (Stripe/Adyen, secure but processor-locked), and
digital wallet tokens (Apple Pay/Google Pay, great UX but not the best
for subscriptions). Confusing them can lead to vendor lock-in, failed
payments, or lost revenue. As payments scale globally, choosing the
right tokenization strategy is a growth and reliability decision, not
just a security upgrade. 

 HOW I MADE 152% APY ON STABLECOINS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A liquidity provider on ZKP2P generated 152% APY over 9 months by
earning spreads on peer-to-peer fiat-to-crypto conversions, producing
$12.7K yield on an average $6.3K USDC deposit through 276 capital
recycling loops totaling $1.57M in volume. The strategy involved
setting above-market rates for USDC sales, receiving fiat payments
verified via zero-knowledge proofs, then moving funds back onchain
through Monerium and redepositing, with 32% of cycles completing in
under 6 hours enabling multiple daily rotations. Market maturation is
evident as competition compressed EUR spreads from 2-3% in March 2025
to 0.5-1% currently, while ZKP2P processed over $20M total volume in
2025.

 HOW I GOT DRAINED AFTER USING PUBLIC HOTEL WI-FI (4 MINUTE READ) [10]


 A crypto user experienced a complete wallet drainage one day after
connecting to public Wi-Fi at a high-end hotel during a holiday stay,
demonstrating that even reputable establishments present significant
security risks for digital asset holders. The incident serves as a
stark reminder that public networks at any venue can expose users to
attack vectors capable of compromising wallet security, including
man-in-the-middle attacks, malicious captive portals, and session
hijacking. The timing of the breach suggests the attacker may have
harvested credentials or session data during the Wi-Fi connection for
later exploitation. 

 THE THREE GAMES OF STABLECOIN FINTECH (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Building stablecoin-native financial services requires competing on
three simultaneous fronts: achieving feature parity with incumbent
neobanks like Mercury and Brex, architecting systems that are
stablecoin-first from the ground up rather than retrofitting crypto
onto legacy infrastructure, and innovating on capabilities that only
blockchain rails can enable. There is a unique competitive challenge
facing crypto fintech builders, who must meet existing user
expectations from traditional fintech while also delivering novel
onchain functionality. Success in stablecoin financial services
requires both defensive parity plays and offensive innovation beyond
what traditional payment rails allow.
