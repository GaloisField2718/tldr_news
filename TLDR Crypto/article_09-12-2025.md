 STRATEGY BUYS $963 MILLION MORE BITCOIN (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Strategy purchased an additional 10,624 BTC for approximately $962.7
million at an average price of $90,615 per bitcoin between December 1
and 7, bringing its total holdings to 660,624 BTC, worth around $60
billion and representing over 3% of Bitcoin's total 21 million supply
with approximately $10.6 billion in unrealized gains. The acquisition,
funded through at-the-market sales of MSTR shares ($928.1m) and STRD
perpetual preferred stock ($34.9m), is part of Strategy's "42/42" plan
targeting $84 billion in capital raises through 2027, while the
company also established a $1.44 billion USD Reserve to cover dividend
payments and debt obligations for approximately 18 months. Despite the
continued accumulation, Strategy's stock has declined 61% from summer
peaks and trades at a market cap-to-net asset value ratio of 0.86,
prompting CoinShares to warn that the digital asset treasury model is
being re-evaluated as "the bubble deflates" amid concerns about
shareholder dilution and token-per-share growth strategies. 

 CFTC LAUNCHES DIGITAL ASSETS PILOT (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham launched a pilot program allowing
Bitcoin, Ether, and USDC as collateral in US derivatives markets for
approved futures commission merchants with strict weekly disclosure
requirements for the first three months and enhanced custody
oversight. The agency withdrew 2020 guidance that blocked crypto
collateral and issued a no-action letter permitting FCMs to hold
digital assets in segregated customer accounts. Coinbase Chief Legal
Officer Paul Grewal called it "precisely what the Administration and
Congress intended the GENIUS Act to enable." The program extends to
tokenized real-world assets like US Treasuries that meet
enforceability, custody, and valuation standards under
technology-neutral rules.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 TETHER EXPANDING TO NINE NEW CHAINS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tether's USDT received regulatory recognition as an accepted
fiat-referenced token across nine blockchains in Abu Dhabi Global
Market, including Aptos, Celo, Cosmos, Kaia, Near, Polkadot, Tezos,
TON, and TRON, adding to earlier approvals for Ethereum, Solana, and
Avalanche. ADGM-licensed institutions can now conduct regulated
activities involving USDT across nearly all networks where the token
circulates, forming a multi-chain foundation enhancing liquidity and
interoperability for trading, settlement, and decentralized
applications. The announcement coincides with Binance securing full
ADGM authorization to operate Binance.com starting January 5, through
three separately licensed entities mirroring traditional
financial-market architecture for exchange, clearinghouse, and
broker-dealer functions. 

 VITALIK BUTERIN PUSHES FOR TRUSTLESS GAS FUTURES MARKET (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Vitalik Buterin has proposed a trustless onchain gas futures market
that allows users to prepay for specific gas quantities in defined
time intervals, but Flashbots strategist Hasu argued the market lacks
a natural short side as many want to hedge gas exposure, but no one is
long gas at scale. Buterin suggested the protocol itself could auction
basefee claiming rights to move from long to neutral while users shift
from short to neutral, though Gnosis co-founder Martin Koppelmann
countered that Ethereum's burn mechanism eliminates validators as
natural sellers who would otherwise hedge without significant risk
premiums.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 SOLANA AND BASE “TWIN CONTRACT” BRIDGE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The new Solana, Base bridge actually works. Tokens move by a standard
lock/mint model on the origin chain, while native tokens are locked
(or foreign tokens burned). On the destination chain, native tokens
are unlocked (or foreign tokens minted). Any SPL token can get its own
deterministic ERC-20 on Base via a factory contract, and Base tokens
can likewise be deployed on Solana. 

 THE THIRD PILLAR OF DIGITAL GOLD (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Privacy represents the third pillar of digital gold alongside
Bitcoin's sovereignty and Ethereum's programmability, and Zcash is
positioned as the underpriced rallying point for private money that
could activate self-reinforcing incentive mechanisms virally spreading
cypherpunk ideals. ZEC pioneers created foundational ZK innovations
like Sonic and Halo that enabled Ethereum's first rollup prototype,
Ignis, built on Zcash's Bellman code seven years ago. Naval's thesis
frames Bitcoin as "insurance against fiat" and ZCash as "insurance
against Bitcoin."

 A WORLD OF 1,000 STABLECOIN NEOBANKS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The current explosion of “stablecoin neobanks” isn't happening
because we suddenly got brilliant product ideas, but because
infrastructure has gotten good enough that anyone can stitch together
a bank-like app. These apps lean on a tiny set of centralized
providers and optimize for perks instead of reliability. When any of
those infra providers fail, the neobank breaks, trust evaporates, and
users retreat back to CEXs and TradFi. We don't need 1,000 flashy
stablecoin banks that “usually” work, we need one built on
rock-solid, redundant infra that always works. 

 TOKENIZED DEPOSITS VS STABLECOINS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Tokenized deposits vs. stablecoins debate is a false fight as
banks create credit, stablecoins move money, and the future system
needs both. Tokenized deposits keep corporate funds inside banks so
they can borrow cheaply against them, while stablecoins are fully
reserved, cash-like dollars that can move permissionlessly, 24/7,
across borders. The real unlock is on-chain interoperability. Instant
swaps between bank deposits and stablecoins so a company can tap cheap
bank credit and pay anyone globally in seconds. In this framing,
deposits = regulated credit rails, and stablecoins = universal
settlement rails.
