 MARC ANDREESSEN AND THE CFPB: DEBUNKING THE DEBANKING DEBUNKERS (29
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article details the systematic debanking of crypto companies and
founders under “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” alleging that
regulators, particularly the FDIC, imposed a secret 15% deposit cap on
banks for crypto-related firms and pressured banks to stop serving the
industry. Multiple high-profile crypto executives, including leaders
from Kraken and Gemini, have corroborated experiences of banking
restrictions. Marc Andreessen claims that over 30 founders in his
portfolio faced debanking. Despite no formal legislation or rulemaking
process, the practice continues to impact the industry through
unofficial regulations.

 ZATOSHI AND ZETHEREUM (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A proposal from Balaji suggests implementing privacy features on

established legal precedent for privacy-preserving smart contracts.
The proposed “Zethereum” would use zero-knowledge proofs to ensure
optional privacy at the smart contract level rather than the base
layer, which would manage legal risk.
