 HACKER EXPLOITS TRUTH TERMINAL FOUNDER'S X ACCOUNT, NETS $600K BY
PROMOTING A SCAM TOKEN (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Truth Terminal founder Andy Ayrey's X account was hacked. The
attacker promoted a scam token that quickly gained hype, reaching a
$25M market cap and netting the hacker $600k, before a mass sell-off
caused the token's value to plummet. Ayrey has regained access to his
account, which he claims was compromised through a SIM swap attack,
but suspicious activity continues to appear on his profile.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 LIDO STAKING GOES CROSS-CHAIN VIA CHAINLINK CCIP (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Lido has integrated Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol
(CCIP) to enable Direct Staking across L2 networks like Arbitrum,
Base, and Optimism. This allows users to stake ETH and receive wstETH
in a single, streamlined transaction. The innovation simplifies
cross-chain staking, improves liquidity for wstETH, and improves the
accessibility of liquid staking within the multi-chain DeFi ecosystem.


 FINALLY, FINALITY: NAKAMOTO UPGRADE SETS THE STAGE SBTC, BITCOIN FOR
BUILDERS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Nakamoto upgrade on Stacks introduced Bitcoin finality, aligning
Stacks' security with Bitcoin's and setting the stage for sBTC. sBTC
is a programmable Bitcoin asset that unlocks new decentralized app
opportunities on the Bitcoin network. The upgrade also brings faster
blocks and higher Stacking rewards. Upcoming developments will further
improve performance and support for Bitcoin builders as they prepare
for the sBTC launch.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 UNICHAIN AND THE FUTURE OF DAO GOVERNANCE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stanford Crypto has raised concerns about Uniswap's unexpected launch
of Unichain, which was deployed without prior DAO delegate
consultation. There have been worrying governance precedents and a
lack of transparency in the decision-making process, particularly
regarding the choice of Optimism's stack over Arbitrum Orbit. The
controversy has sparked broader discussions about the actual extent of
decentralization in Uniswap's governance. 

 STABLECOINS | THE MONETARY UPGRADE (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stablecoins have emerged as a transformative force in global finance,
reaching a market cap of $164 billion in October 2024 and processing
transaction volumes nearly double that of Visa in Q2. The rapid
adoption is evidenced by stablecoin issuers becoming major holders of
US Treasury bonds and surpassing countries like Germany and Mexico in
holdings. Stripe's acquisition of Bridge signals institutional
interest in stablecoins as they target the trillions of volume in
dollar-based trading and payments.

 CRYPTO INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDERS CONTINUE TO SWITCH TO APPS (1 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The recent shift from building crypto infrastructure to focusing on
user experience demonstrates that in today's market, success stems
from creating direct value for users rather than complex underlying
infrastructure. This marks a transition from “picks and shovels”
to owning the “gold” itself. 

 COINBASE TO INTEGRATE VISA DIRECT TO DELIVER REAL-TIME ACCOUNT
FUNDING FOR CUSTOMERS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Visa and Coinbase have announced a partnership that will enable
real-time account funding and withdrawals for Coinbase users through
Visa Direct. It will allow customers with eligible Visa debit cards to
instantly fund their Coinbase accounts, buy crypto, and cash out to
bank accounts – a process significantly faster than the current 1-3
day waiting process. This expands Coinbase's Visa relationship beyond
its co-branded debit card.
