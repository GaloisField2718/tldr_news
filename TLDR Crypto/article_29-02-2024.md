MARKETS & BUSINESS

 MORGAN STANLEY EVALUATING SPOT BITCOIN ETFS FOR ITS GIANT BROKERAGE
PLATFORM (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Morgan Stanley might become the next major institution to offer spot
bitcoin ETF products. Recognizing the potential benefits of including
cryptocurrency-based products in investors' portfolios, Morgan
Stanley's move follows the SEC's approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in
January and the overwhelming demand for those products since they
rolled out. The entry of large broker-dealer platforms into this
investment space could significantly accelerate inflows into these
newly introduced products. 

 COINBASE USERS SEE $0 BALANCE AFTER CRYPTO-TRADING APP SUFFERS GLITCH
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Coinbase experienced a technical glitch that caused users' account
balances to display as zero as Bitcoin surpassed $60k yesterday. This
malfunction coincided with a sudden drop in prices across the space
that resulted in over $1.7 billion in liquidations. Coinbase quickly
acknowledged the issue and assured its users that their assets were
safe and deployed fixes over the next few hours. Coinbase CEO Brian
Armstrong said that the level of traffic it experienced yesterday well
exceeded the 10x surges in traffic the company had modeled for,
leading to the issues users experienced.

 TAKING PROFIT IN A BULL RUN (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It is important to take profits during bull runs. When deciding
whether to take profits, consider your financial situation, the market
conditions, and your individual portfolio/trading style. For perps,
consider funding rates and the timing of the last correction. For spot
positions, take into account plans for the position, the expectation
of price dips, and the emotional impact of seeing unrealized profits
decrease. 

 4 PHASES OF A BULL MARKET (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The four stages of a bull market are: 'Rebirth,' where investors
begin to see a positive price trend; 'Excitement,' when all coins are
back to or surpassing all-time highs; 'Euphoria,' which is a period of
intense activity and mainstream interest; and 'Disconnection' (or
'Insanity'), which is marked by unsustainable growth and irrational
decisions.
