Investment in cryptocurrency companies dropped significantly in
January this year compared to January 2022. Transactions decreased
from 166 in January 2022 to 62 last month. There were 17 deals that
were worth over $100 million in January 2022 and only one so far this
year. Investments this January mainly centered around smaller,
early-stage enterprises. It is possible that some of these investments
had already begun to raise money prior to the FTX's collapse in
November.

BONQDAO PROTOCOL SUFFERS $120M LOSS AFTER ORACLE HACK (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://cointelegraph.com/news/bonqdao-protocol-suffers-120m-loss-after-oracle-hack?utm_source=tldrnewsletter]


BonqDAO was the recent victim of an oracle hack that resulted in an
estimated $120 million loss. The exploit enabled the attacker to
manipulate the price of AllianceBlock's ALBT token, permitting them to
mint large amounts of BEUR. The BEUR was then swapped for other tokens
on Uniswap. This reduced ALBT's price to almost zero, triggering the
liquidation of ALBT troves. BonqDAO has paused the protocol and all
liquidity has been removed while the team works on a recovery
solution. No smart contracts were exploited on AllianceBlock.
AllianceBlock will mint new ALBT tokens to compensate those affected
by the exploit. 

EX-APP STORE DIRECTOR: 'APPLE HAD A PROBLEM WITH CRYPTO FROM DAY ONE'
(5 MINUTE READ)
[https://decrypt.co/120474/ex-app-store-director-apple-problem-with-crypto?utm_source=tldrnewsletter]


It is particularly difficult for crypto companies and projects to get
listed in Apple's App Store. This is not accidental, according to the
former App Store director. Apple's guidelines are deliberately
unclear. This has allowed the company to act as a gatekeeper and
enforce a strict policy against crypto and NFTs. Any NFTs bought
in-app are subject to Apple's 30% fee. Developers are not allowed to
offer workarounds to evade the fee. NFTs viewed through an app are not
allowed to unlock any additional content or in-app features.
