MARKETS & BUSINESS

 KALSHI CLEARED TO OFFER CONGRESSIONAL PREDICTION MARKETS IN VICTORY
AGAINST CFTC (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Kalshi, a US-regulated prediction market platform, won its lawsuit
against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over launching
markets on which party will control the Senate and House of
Representatives after the November elections. Though Kalshi does not
integrate blockchain, this is a win for prediction markets like
Polymarket, which have been operating solely outside of the United
States. The CFTC has filed an emergency motion to stop Kalshi from
listing its markets. 

 THE BOOMING CRYPTO USE CASE THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Bloomberg's ‚ÄòOdd Lots' podcast this week covered stablecoins and
their legitimate use globally as a payment and settlement platform.
Stablecoins significantly improve legacy payment systems by offering
cheap, near-instant, and light-regulation options for citizens of any
country to send US dollar-backed digital assets. This marks one of the
leading legitimate use cases of the highly speculative crypto
industry.

 JAPAN'S THREE MAJOR BANKS TO TEST CROSS-BORDER STABLECOIN TRANSFER
PLATFORM (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho, the megabanks of Japan, are piloting a
cross-border stablecoin transfer platform. The initiative, ‚ÄúProject
Pax,‚Äù will use stablecoins issued by bank-backed Progmat and run by
Datachain and TOKI. It will use SWIFT's existing APIs to settle on
blockchain networks and be commercialized by 2025.

 EIGEN SIMPLY EXPLAINED (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 EigenLayer repurposes Ethereum's existing security for new projects
without needing separate validation processes. This simplifies the use
of shared resources and improves overall network efficiency. The
approach allows participants to leverage their original resources

transaction signing. It may potentially integrate with Solflare.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ZILLIQA RETROSPECTIVE (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Zilliqa is an alt L1 from the 2017 bull market that was similar to
Solana but never gained traction. Though it had good tech, the
protocol pivoted to focusing on RWAs and enterprise projects instead
of developer tooling and experience. Solana, who focused primarily on
DevEx, exchange integrations, and ecosystem growth, ultimately won. 

 WEAK NARRATIVE FORMATION IN CRYPTO (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Twitter ‚ÄòFor You' feed emphasizes engagement-farming and
election-related posts instead of quality content. With the recent
sentiment around too much infra and not enough apps, we are now seeing
copycat projects of existing apps like Polymarket and Pump.fun. Both
of these projects could have indirectly benefited from the emphasis on
election content and short-term attention spans.
