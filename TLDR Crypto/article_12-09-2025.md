MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN HOLDS $114K AS CPI KEEPS SEPTEMBER RATE CUT IN PLAY (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin steadied near $114K after August CPI data matched
expectations, reinforcing odds of a 25 bps Fed rate cut next week.
Headline CPI rose 2.9% YoY, while core held at 3.1%, aligning with
forecasts and supporting a dovish policy pivot. Analysts say BTC
remains bullish if it can close above $113K-$113.5K, with ETF inflows
strengthening and markets now pricing in up to three rate cuts before
Q1 2026. 

 MULTICOIN CREATING WORLD'S LARGEST SOLANA TREASURY COMPANY (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto, and Galaxy led a $1.65 billion
investment into Forward Industries (FORD) to create the world's
leading Solana treasury company. Kyle Samani was appointed as
Chairman. Each sponsor committed over $100 million and attracted
participation from major firms, including Bitwise, Ribbit Capital, and
crypto angels. The strategy adapts MicroStrategy's Bitcoin DAT model
to Solana, aiming to increase "SOL per share" through active treasury
management, including DeFi participation, acquiring discounted SOL
through sponsor networks, and arbitraging cost of capital differences
between traditional banking and DeFi protocols. Samani argues SOL
offers superior properties for a DAT compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum,
citing native staking yields of approximately 8.05% (including 1.86%
real yield from MEV and economic activity) versus Ethereum's 3.21%
total yield with only 0.41% real yield, while Bitcoin generates zero
real yield.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 KRAKEN BRINGS PERPS TRADING TO RETAIL AHEAD OF IPO (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Kraken has expanded access to perpetual futures (“perps”) for
eligible retail traders in select regions, positioning the product as
a simplified way for “everyday investors” to speculate on crypto
prices or manage risk. First introduced by BitMEX in 2016, perps now
account for the majority of derivatives activity, with Hyperliquid
leading volumes. The launch comes as Kraken prepares for a potential
2026 IPO, rolling out perps with built-in protections like stop-loss
functions and collateral in USD balances, alongside broader product
expansion into tokenized stocks and an in-house Ethereum L2 called
INK. 

 PULSE: THE PENDLE PT AGENT (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Giza's Pulse is the first autonomous agent that optimizes Pendle
Principal Token (PT) portfolios. The non-custodial agent automatically
handles portfolio construction across PT markets, real-time
rebalancing to higher yields, slippage forecasting, and maturity
management, including rollovers and exits, eliminating the manual
tracking and expiry anxiety associated with fixed yield strategies.
Built in partnership with Pendle, Pulse represents an evolution toward
"Swarm Finance" where protocols offer rewards to attract agent
liquidity, agents capture boosted yields automatically, and fees flow
to token buybacks, creating a competitive ecosystem for automated
capital allocation. The platform plans to expand to additional chains
and assets.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 DEBUNKING THE SEASONALITY MYTH (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Coinbase's institutional crypto research report maintains a bullish
outlook for early Q4 2025, driven by resilient liquidity, favorable
macroeconomic conditions, and supportive regulatory dynamics, with
Bitcoin positioned for outperformance as Federal Reserve rate cuts are
expected in September and October. Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs)
have evolved from early adoption into a competitive
"player-versus-player" phase, with public DATs now holding over 1M BTC
($110B) and 4.9M ETH ($21.3B), though early mover premiums have
dissipated as the market matures. The report conducts extensive
statistical analysis debunking crypto seasonality myths, particularly
the "September effect," using multiple methodologies, including Wilson
confidence intervals, logistic regression, and out-of-sample
predictions, to demonstrate that monthly calendar patterns are not
statistically significant predictors of Bitcoin returns. Despite
Bitcoin's historical weakness in six consecutive Septembers from 2017
to 2022, assuming each month has roughly the same odds as the
long-term average outperforms all calendar-based trading approaches. 

 USDH PROPOSALS EXPLAINED (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There are nine different proposals for Hyperliquid's USDH stablecoin
partnership, each offering distinct approaches to backing, yield
allocation, and ecosystem integration. The proposals showcase varying
risk profiles, from conservative T-Bills and cash backing to more
complex structures like Ethena's delta-neutral strategies and Sky's
diversified RWA portfolio, with most committing significant portions
of yield revenue to the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Regulatory approaches
differ substantially, with established players leveraging existing
GENIUS Act compliance while newer entrants like Native Markets plan to
use Stripe's Bridge infrastructure for regulatory coverage. The USDH
proposal battle is under controversy for seemingly favoring Native
Markets from the beginning and being yet another instance of
decentralization theatre.

 WHY PREDICTION MARKETS COULD SAVE THE WORLD (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Prediction markets could solve the modern "Information Problem" - the
shift from centralized, slow information flows to decentralized,
instant but low-quality information that makes distinguishing truth
from noise increasingly difficult. AI will exponentially worsen this
crisis through indistinguishable deepfakes and personalized
manipulation tools that could be weaponized by malicious actors to
turn citizens against each other and enable authoritarian control.
Prediction markets offer a solution by applying capitalism's price
mechanism to information discovery, where real financial stakes
incentivize accuracy and collective intelligence outperforms bias and
manipulation, as demonstrated by Polymarket's superior accuracy in
calling the 2024 US Presidential election before traditional media
outlets. The vision extends beyond speculation to prediction markets
becoming critical infrastructure for truth discovery, enabling better
decision-making for individuals and corporations, rapid response to
misinformation campaigns, and potentially revitalizing journalism
through trading desks that profit from accuracy. 

 MEASURING GROWTH IN CRYPTO (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto companies must adapt rather than copy web2 marketing
playbooks, with different business models requiring distinct
approaches: L1/L2s focus on Monthly Active Addresses and developer
ecosystem growth, protocols track users/volume/TVL, while wallets and
games use more traditional DAU and ARPU metrics. Core web2 metrics
like Customer Acquisition Cost, Lifetime Value, and LTV:CAC ratios
require crypto-specific adaptations to account for wallet-based
customers, token incentives, and onchain value creation, while the
marketing funnel stages present unique challenges, including
restricted advertising access, complex attribution tracking between
web2 and onchain actions, and distinguishing organic growth from
airdrop farming. Crypto has unique advantages like onchain data
transparency and instant verifiable rewards, but over-relying on
incentivized metrics may mask a lack of product-market fit.
