 WHITE HOUSE TO MEET WITH EXECUTIVES TO DISCUSS MARKET STRUCTURE BILL
(4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The White House is convening a meeting between major crypto firms and
traditional banks to address deadlock over digital asset market
structure legislation that stalled earlier this month. The primary
dispute centers on whether stablecoin issuers can offer
interest-bearing features or rewards derived from reserve assets, with
banks warning such products could trigger deposit flight from the
traditional financial system. Wall Street institutions have
successfully lobbied bipartisan lawmakers against allowing
yield-generating stablecoin products, viewing them as a competitive
threat, while crypto industry participants argue these features
benefit end users. The White House crypto policy council and officials
from the National Economic Council and Treasury aim to gather direct
market feedback to resolve the impasse and advance the legislation. 

 FIDELITY INVESTMENTS STARTS ITS OWN STABLECOIN (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Fidelity Investments is launching the Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD)
in early February, marking one of the largest traditional financial
institutions' entry into the stablecoin market. The stablecoin will be
issued by Fidelity Digital Assets, a federally chartered bank, and
operate on Ethereum with 1:1 dollar redeemability across Fidelity's
platforms, major exchanges, and DeFi protocols for use cases including
24/7 institutional settlement and onchain payments. The launch was
enabled by the recently passed GENIUS Act, which provides regulatory
clarity for stablecoin reserves consisting of cash, cash equivalents,
and short-term Treasuries with daily public disclosures and
third-party attestations. Fidelity is entering into direct competition
with Circle and Tether in the $308 billion stablecoin market,
positioning FIDD as foundational infrastructure for expanding its
onchain financial services ecosystem.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 TRUST MINIMIZED TRANSACTION SIMULATION USING STATE PROOFS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Wallet simulations currently depend on vulnerable RPC providers for
state data. Deploying Merkle Patricia Trie proofs and multi-node
consensus enables cryptographic prestate verification before
execution. This trust-minimized architecture eliminates single points
of failure, providing users with verifiable security when previewing
transactions before signing. 

 THGOLD, THE FIRST YIELD-BEARING GOLD (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Theo network is launching thGOLD – tokenized gold earning ~2%
yield. It lends gold to established institutions and retailers and
passes a portion of the earnings to token holders. thGOLD is available
in early access for minting and redeeming.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHERE DOES CRYPTO GO FROM HERE? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto is losing its position as the default destination for
speculative capital, with AI attracting $35B in private investment in
2024 (up 8.5x from 2022) and robotics securing $2B in Q1 2025 alone,
while institutional capital increasingly favors crypto equities and
spot ETFs over altcoins. Stablecoins have emerged as the dominant use
case with $304B in total supply (up 33% YoY), monthly volumes
exceeding both PayPal and Visa, and stablecoin reserves now holding
$133B in US Treasuries as the 19th largest holder. Value is migrating
from infrastructure – which is commoditizing as data availability
costs race to zero – to the application layer, with RWAs scaling
rapidly from $15M in tokenized stocks in January 2025 to over $500M
today, while equity perpetuals gain traction across multiple
platforms. 

 PERPS MARKET LANDSCAPE (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hyperliquid operates on a dual-chain architecture with HyperCore
handling native trading execution (200,000 orders per second at 0.2
second latency via HyperBFT consensus) and HyperEVM supporting dApp
development, including lending protocols, liquid staking derivatives,
and yield strategies. The platform's vault system includes
protocol-run HLP vaults for market making and liquidations, plus user
vaults requiring leaders to maintain 5% stake and taking 10% of
profits. HYPE tokenomics allocate 31% to a genesis airdrop across
94,000 users, 38.888% for future emissions, and 23.8% to core
contributors with vesting through 2027-2028. HIP-3 introduces
permissionless builder-deployed perpetuals, marking a significant step
toward decentralizing the perpetual listing process beyond protocol
control.

 STABLECOIN ISSUANCE IS UNBUNDLING, VALUE SHIFTS TO DISTRIBUTION (1
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The stablecoin stack is fragmenting from full-stack issuers toward
specialists (reserves, contracts, and onchain ops) and re-bundlers,
but the biggest economic prize accrues to brands that own distribution
because KYC/rails orchestration and payouts matter and scale buys
leverage. Whoever re-bundles the money workflow will capture the most
value. 

 QASH TO BUILD A STABLECOIN-POWERED NEOBANK FOR LATIN AMERICA (1
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Qash closed a $1.5 million pre-seed round led by Chaac Ventures with
participation from Antler to scale its stablecoin-powered neobank. It
was founded by Venezuelan-born Boris Spiwak to help Latin Americans
save, spend, and invest in US dollars, with the new capital earmarked
to expand product offerings, grow the team, and accelerate user
acquisition amid rising stablecoin adoption after the GENIUS Act. Qash
hopes to build on existing momentum as transaction volume has grown
about 35x in six months.
