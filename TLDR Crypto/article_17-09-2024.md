 ARBITRUM FOUNDER'S THOUGHTS ON L1 GRANTS (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Early in Arbitrum's history, it was offered money from an alt L1 to
build for their network in addition to Ethereum. Though Arbitrum would
have had more money then, its long-term growth and adoption would have
suffered. Co-founder Steven Goldfeder recommends new projects to keep
their ‚Äúeye on the prize‚Äù and focus on the bigger picture. 

 HIGH FDV COINS, THE ICARUS MYTH OF THIS CYCLE (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto projects launching with excessively high fully diluted
valuations (FDVs) often face a quick downfall. Factors like anchoring
bias, inflated VC valuations, poor incentive structures, and token
distribution create imbalances between early investors and public
buyers. The lack of genuine price discovery harms the project's chance
at long-term success. Avoiding high FDV launches, raising VC funds
wisely, and ensuring product-market fit before launch can help
mitigate these issues.
