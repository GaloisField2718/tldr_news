MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN BREAKS $125K AMID “UPTOBER” MOMENTUM (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $125,700 on Sunday, surpassing its
August record as “Uptober” gains continued despite a US government
shutdown. Analysts attribute the rally to an accumulation phase,
cooling speculative activity, and easing long-term holder sell
pressure, with spot Bitcoin ETFs seeing their second-highest weekly
inflows since launch. 

 COINBASE SEEKS OCC CHARTER TO BRIDGE CRYPTO AND TRADFI (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Coinbase is pursuing a national trust company charter from the US
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), joining firms like
Paxos, BitGo, Ripple, and Circle in applying for federal licensing.
The charter would streamline regulatory oversight and support
Coinbase's goal of integrating digital assets more deeply into
traditional finance while maintaining strict compliance and security.
Coinbase has no intention of becoming a bank. The move is a step
toward clear federal rules that enable responsible innovation.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 METAMASK CONFIRMS $30M ONCHAIN REWARDS PROGRAM (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 MetaMask's upcoming Rewards program will feature referral bonuses,
mUSD incentives, partner rewards, and access to future tokens. It is
not a yield farming scheme. Season 1 alone will distribute over $30
million in LINEA tokens, making it one of the largest onchain reward
programs ever. Long-time users will receive exclusive perks tied to
the future MetaMask token, with full rollout details coming in the
next few weeks. 

 SAMSUNG WALLET PARTNERS WITH COINBASE ONE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Samsung Wallet has expanded its Coinbase partnership to offer Galaxy
users special access to a free three-month subscription to Coinbase
One, providing boosted staking rewards, exclusive partner offers, and
zero trading fees on select assets for US users subscribing to the
Standard Tier. The enhanced integration builds on Samsung's July
partnership, which brought full Coinbase cryptocurrency payments and
management to Galaxy devices, initially rolling out to select users in
the US and Canada in August with plans for broader expansion. New
Coinbase users making their first trade through Samsung Wallet receive
a $25 credit, while the premium membership experience aims to
streamline crypto access. Samsung continues its push into
convenience-friendly payments, complementing recent Samsung Wallet
features, including NFC-based peer-to-peer payments between devices in
the same room and the ability to split in-store payments into
installments for easier transaction management.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 SUPPORTIVE SIGNALS, GOLD AND STABLECOINS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Coinbase maintains a tactically bullish October outlook driven by US
dollar softness, short-term global liquidity impulse, and Fed policy
bias toward insurance cuts, with the government shutdown potentially
delaying key economic data releases and forcing markets to rely on
private gauges like ADP employment showing essentially zero net job
creation. SWIFT's announcement to embed a blockchain-based shared
ledger into its infrastructure for bank-grade stablecoin settlement
represents a watershed moment that formally mainstreams the digital
economy, coinciding with adjusted stablecoin transaction volumes
reaching $3.07 trillion in September and surpassing major retail
payment rails. Tether is reportedly seeking $15-20 billion in fresh
capital for approximately 3% equity at a potential $500 billion
valuation, with USDT's dominant 58% market share reinforced by a surge
in perpetual futures activity that predominantly quotes and margins in
USDT, driving mechanical circulation increases. Gold is not a reliable
bitcoin indicator due to inconsistent correlations swinging from -0.8
to +0.8 since 2013. Global liquidity is the most reliable macro
signal, with consistent ~0.9 correlations over the past three years.
Spot bitcoin ETFs attracted $3.5 billion in September inflows,
comparable to gold ETFs' $4.2 billion despite bitcoin's recent
underperformance. 

 CRYPTO'S ENDGAME: PROOFS AND PRAGMATISM (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Zero-knowledge proofs excel in specific contexts like rollup security
and high-stakes nation-state protection but are overkill for everyday
transactions, with proof generation costing around ten cents per
simple action versus near-free signatures, leading to adoption
primarily as invisible infrastructure rather than user-demanded
features. ZKML compounds this problem by stacking GPU-intensive proof
generation on top of GPU-intensive inference, creating costly
solutions seeking problems to solve, while fully homomorphic
encryption still depends on MPC/TSS for distributed key control to
avoid centralized trust points. Smart accounts face fundamental
limitations by trapping automation inside single blockchain state
machines, unable to enforce simple cross-chain rules like daily
spending limits that span multiple networks and contexts where real
user identities operate. The pragmatic alternative uses threshold
cryptography with MPC/TSS+TEE as a layered model where smart accounts
handle narrow on-chain guardrails while threshold systems enforce
sophisticated cross-chain policies, multi-context identity, and
higher-order automation above individual blockchains.

 ETHREX: MINIMALIST L2 WITHOUT THE TOKEN PROBLEM (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Layer-2 stacks are structurally unsustainable because their tokens
undermine long-term developer incentives. Once vesting ends, core
teams lose motivation, leaving bloated, hard-to-maintain codebases
behind. Ethrex avoids this trap with a minimal, maintainable design
that functions as both an L1 and L2 client and carries no token,
enabling anyone to launch an L2 with a single command. Its open,
tokenless model and forthcoming documentation aim to make Ethereum
scaling infrastructure fully self-sustaining and community-driven. 

 POLYGON TOKEN HOLDERS' MANIFESTO (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Polygon leadership needs to act to reverse $POL's severe
underperformance (down 46% year-over-year and 92% below its ATH)
despite a strong market. Persistent 2% inflation, unclear execution
around AggLayer, and waning holder confidence indicate that $POL risks
becoming a “dino token” without decisive intervention. The team
should end inflation, introduce buybacks or burns, and restore
transparency to rebuild investor trust and spark a recovery toward
$0.71 as a first sign of reversal.
