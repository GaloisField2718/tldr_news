MARKETS & BUSINESS

 RUSSIA CONSIDERING BANNING CRYPTO EXCHANGES (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Beribit clients have occupied the Russian crypto exchange's offices,
demanding their funds amidst a financial discrepancy audit. Russian
Duma is considering a bill that would ban crypto exchanges but allow
transactions and mining by registered firms. This legislative move is
being challenged as it could potentially affect national security
interests due to cryptocurrencies' role in bypassing sanctions. 

 FRANKLIN TEMPLETON LISTS ETHEREUM ETF ON DTCC (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Franklin Templeton has listed its Ether ETF on the DTCC, signaling
its readiness for trading. However, this does not mean the SEC has
approved it, given the official decision has been delayed until June
11.

 RISC ZERO'S STEEL: A GAME-CHANGER FOR EVM DEVELOPERS (1 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Steel is an Alloy-based proof library that, alongside RISC Zero's ZK
Coprocessor, has access to Ethereum's entire state for viewing. It
allows for complex contract execution for a fraction of the fees with
trustless off-chain execution. The library is valuable for
applications that need to access Ethereum's state in a trustless
manner with only a few lines of code.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ARE BORED APES DEAD? (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection floor price is at 10 ETH â€“
down 92% from its April 2022 all-time high. There were numerous
reasons for the decline, including interest in other collections, the
NFT market downturn, and a lack of cohesive strategy from creator Yuga
Labs. Going forward, the launch of the Otherside metaverse, the return
of Yuga's co-founder as the CEO, and the consolidation of Yuga's IP
could revitalize the project. 

 A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF HEROGLYPHS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Heroglyphs is a new token protocol on Ethereum that only allows
validators to mint tokens. This not only incentivizes
decentralization, but also creates an aura of prestige around each
token due to the commitment required to create one. Like Runes or
Ordinals, Heroglyphs are created by inscribing data into a block, with
minting rewards shared equally between all validators. Rights to mint
and manage tokens can only be leased using a Herberger tax model,
meaning anyone can pay more and take the ticker.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A BREAKDOWN OF SOLANA ONCHAIN METRICS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Despite claims that Solana's growth has peaked, data shows increased
usage, particularly marked by a surge in priority fee usage (some of
which comes from bots), stablecoin transactions that outpace other
blockchains, and an average monthly DEX volume that is 18 times higher
than previous years. Similarly, Solana's Total Value Locked (TVL) has
risen from $210 million to $4 billion. 

 OFFCHAIN LABS FINDS TWO VULNERABILITIES IN OPTIMISM FRAUD PROOF

 Offchain Labs, the company behind the Arbitrum L2, found two severe
vulnerabilities in Optimism's fraud-proof system. The exploits, which
have now been patched, allowed for fraudulent chain history to be
accepted. Fortunately, the vulnerabilities were only on testnet and
funds were never at risk.
