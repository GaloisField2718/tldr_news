MARKETS & BUSINESS

 MACRO CONDITIONS, REGULATION, AND NEW INFRA WILL DEFINE CRYPTO IN
2026 (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 2026 is about infrastructure becoming real and determining whether
rails (custody, settlement, identity, and compliance) can support
production-grade institutional usage. Regulatory divergence by
geography will shape system design, while stablecoins + tokenization
expand as core rails. Bitcoin will trade more like a macro asset,
driven by rates/data and ETF flows. 

 PREDICTION MARKETS EXPLODE IN 2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Kalshi and Polymarket became the dominant prediction markets in 2025.
They did tens of billions in annual volume with sports as the biggest
growth driver, and formed partnerships that pushed them into
mainstream finance/media. Challengers like Gemini, Crypto.com, and
DraftKings are attempting to compete through distribution and
bundling.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING SHADE: THE PRIVATE L2 (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Shade Network is a fully private Layer-2 execution environment that
encrypts all transactions, smart contracts, and agent actions by
default. It is a "Private Execution Layer" that combines Monero-level
privacy guarantees with Ethereum's programmability and Layer-2
performance. Shade addresses growing concerns around MEV extraction
and blockchain surveillance through an architecture featuring
encrypted mempools, stealth addresses, private EVM execution, and
zero-knowledge verified settlement. It differentiates itself from
existing privacy solutions like Monero, Zcash, Tornado Cash, and Aztec
by making privacy foundational infrastructure rather than an optional
feature. 

 LIGHTER LAUNCHES LIT TOKEN (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LIT is Lighter's native infrastructure token. It is designed to align
incentives across its decentralized perps platform. LIT is similar to
HYPE in structure and purpose, though it exists as an L2 instead of an
L1. The token is starting to list across major exchanges.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE COMPOSABILITY OF CRYPTO DERIVATIVES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto derivatives, particularly perpetual futures and options, are
mainstreaming rapidly with DEXs processing over $1.2T in perp volume
monthly by end-2025, led by Hyperliquid. Traders are seeking leveraged
returns amid stagnant altcoin spot markets, with the systematic
leverage ratio showing ~10% of crypto in purely speculative exposure.
High-throughput decentralized platforms and increased regulated US
access are fueling this integration into the broader financial system.


 TOKENS VERSUS EQUITY: THE NEW REGULATORY LANDSCAPE (4 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 The debate over tokens versus equity has barely begun, with many top
crypto projects having emerged during the Gensler era when regulatory
pressure forced developers to drive all value to equity rather than
tokens. The new policy environment opens fresh opportunities but
presents no simple answers, as projects must now reassess their token
economics and value accrual strategies. This shift could fundamentally
reshape how crypto startups structure their offerings and distribute
value to stakeholders. Tokens maintain their position as a novel
capital formation mechanism and vehicle for innovation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPEN LETTER TO JESSE AND BRIAN (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Base is currently overweighting a creator economy narrative when it
should be positioning itself as a comprehensive onchain ecosystem and
financial alternative. While Base has successfully attracted trading
platforms and DeFi products, these aren't differentiators. What sets
Base apart is its potential to build a complete onchain economy where
builders, businesses, and ownership coins thrive together. The true
opportunity for Base lies in shifting focus from creator/content
networks to fostering real onchain business usage, real economic
opportunity, and genuine tokenization of business value. 

 THE THESIS FOR SPOT EQUITIES ONCHAIN (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Onchain spot equities will follow the same path as stablecoins. Once
dollars increasingly live onchain, it becomes natural for users to buy
and hold other assets (like equities) on the same rails. This is
because onchain will become the default home for folks' portfolios.
The real unlock isn't convenience (24/7 and faster settlement) but new
utility, especially permissionless securities lending (more yield
passed to holders) and borrowing against equities without the typical
brokerage gatekeeping.
