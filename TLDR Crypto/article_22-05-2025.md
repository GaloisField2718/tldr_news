 SEC CHARGES UNICOIN WITH $100M `SECURITIES FRAUD` (9 MINUTE READ) [4]


 The SEC sued Unicoin and its executives for raising over $100 million
through tokens falsely advertised as backed by real estate. Regulators
allege most property deals never closed and were overstated, while
sales claims inflated $3 billion in rights certificates despite
raising only $110 million. Unicoin's marketing touted returns up to
nine million percent via widespread ads, and CEO Konanykhin declined a
December Wells notice settlement, calling demands unacceptable. The
SEC seeks disgorgement and civil penalties for securities law
violations. 

 NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS IS CREATING A CRYPTO ADVISORY COUNCIL (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Mayor Eric Adams announced a digital assets advisory council to
funnel fintech jobs and expertise into New York City, with a
chairperson to be named shortly. The council will advise on blockchain
and crypto initiatives, such as exploring on-chain storage of vital
records, and help shape policies that serve residents. Adams framed
the effort as harnessing “technology of tomorrow” and showcased
participation from family offices and unicorn startups.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SP1 HYPERCUBE – REAL-TIME ETHEREUM PROVING IS HERE (14 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 SP1 Hypercube is ZK's “man on the moon moment,” as it proves over
93% of Ethereum mainnet blocks in under the current block time of 12
seconds. It achieves 5x lower latency and cost compared to SP1 turbo
using a novel zkVM optimized for multilinear polynomials. A real-time
prover cluster requires roughly 160 Nvidia 4090 GPUs (~$300k), with
potential to drop to ~$100k on cost-efficient hardware. By delivering
sub-12s proofs, SP1 Hypercube paves the way for L1 scaling, native
rollups, and improved interoperability. 

 AGENT COMMERCE KIT (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Agent Commerce Kit provides open-source protocols, including ACK-ID
for verifiable agent identity and ACK-Pay for agent-native payments,
that bridge AI with legacy financial systems. ACK-ID uses DIDs and
Verifiable Credentials to establish cryptographic ownership and secure
authentication and privacy-preserving disclosure, while ACK-Pay
standardizes payment initiation, flexible settlement across
traditional and blockchain rails, and cryptographic receipts with
optional human oversight. It also features advanced micropayment and
conditional payment features, x402 interoperability, and
agent-specific reputation frameworks.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE RISE OF ONCHAIN AI: AGENTS, APPS, AND COMMERCE (30 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Autonomous AI agents are becoming prolific onchain participants by
holding wallets, executing smart contracts, and powering AI-infused
applications. Important infrastructure spans trusted execution
environments, agent frameworks and toolkits, agent launchpads,
multi-agent coordination protocols, Model Context Protocols for
external data, and AI app stores for discovery and monetization. This
“Agentic Commerce” allows agents to transact with humans and each
other via crypto rails and stablecoins, exemplified by protocols like
x402 enabling machine-speed, always-on economic activity. While
promising rapid growth and innovation, the ecosystem must overcome
challenges in agent reliability, blockchain scalability, and novel
governance frameworks. 

 STABLECOINS ARE THE TROJAN HORSE OF CRYPTO (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stablecoin transactions hit $6.8T in Q1 2025 as platforms like Stripe
launch native support and issue their own, signaling a shift toward
mainstream adoption. With crypto wallets enabling direct stablecoin
payments at checkout, stablecoins are becoming a default payment rail
for global eCommerce. While Ethereum benefits from this growth, the
stablecoin model diverges from Bitcoin's original vision of
decentralized, intermediary-free payments.

 INTRODUCING SIM: DUNE BEYOND ANALYTICS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Dune has launched SIM, a new language that makes onchain data
analysis easier by replacing complex SQL with a more intuitive,
spreadsheet-like syntax. It's designed to help users build modular,
transparent data models without deep technical expertise. 

 COINBASE ACQUIRING CIRCLE ISN'T CRAZY (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Circle trades at a $5B market cap with $155M net income and a similar
32x P/E as Coinbase, but with USDC poised to grow alongside global
dollar demand and regulatory clarity via the GENIUS Act, its future
earnings potential is much larger. Even with falling interest rates, a
$250B–$500B USDC supply at a 3% yield could generate $7.5B revenue
and $2B+ net income, matching Coinbase's current run rate and
justifying a $60B market cap boost.
