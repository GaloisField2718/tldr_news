 NYC MAYOR CALLS FOR END OF NY BITLICENSE, PROPOSES 'BITBOND' (5
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 NYC Mayor Eric Adams called for the abolition of the New York
Department of Financial Services BitLicense to entice crypto firms
back to the city in a Bitcoin 2025 keynote. He proposed a
“BitBond” municipal bond backed by bitcoin to raise capital with
tax advantages, which would allocate 90% of proceeds to government
funding and 10% to Bitcoin purchases. It would pay holders 1% annual
interest for 10 years plus 100% of Bitcoin's upside up to a 4.5%
compounded return, with residual gains seeding a city Bitcoin reserve.


 U.S. LABOR DEPARTMENT WITHDRAWS PRIOR CRYPTO WARNINGS (9 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The U.S. Department of Labor has withdrawn its March 2022 guidance
cautioning 401(k) fiduciaries against including cryptocurrencies in
retirement plans, issuing a new directive that it will no longer
single out asset classes for praise or warning. Secretary Lori
Chavez‑DeRemer argued that investment decisions belong to plan
fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats, and that the previous stance
improperly “put a thumb on the scale.” The original warning came
just before crypto market failures in 2022, when bitcoin‐linked
retirement holdings fell roughly 52%, though those same positions
would now be up about 156%.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE UNVEILS CDP WALLETS OFFERING CONTROL WITHOUT KEY MANAGEMENT
(4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Coinbase Developer Platform has unveiled a new Wallet API that
allows developers to create onchain experiences without dealing with
the struggles of private key management. It uses Trusted Execution
Environment (TEE) technology to securely store private keys, with
developers making interactions through API calls. US developers can
earn 4.1% USDC rewards on balances in the wallets, which offer
state-of-the-art latency and creation times and full compatibility
with popular tools like wagmi and viem. 

 BLOCK TO ROLL OUT BITCOIN PAYMENTS ON SQUARE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Block's Square Point of Sale app will integrate Lightning Network
bitcoin payments, allowing merchants to accept near-instant, low-cost
transactions via QR codes on Square hardware. The feature is slated to
roll out in the second half of 2025 and reach all eligible sellers in
2026, pending regulatory approvals. Behind the scenes, Square handles
real-time exchange-rate calculations and payment confirmations,
simplifying the checkout experience. This launch builds on 2024's
Bitcoin Conversions and complements Block's bitcoin ecosystem,
including Cash App's trading features, the Bitkey self-custody wallet,
Proto mining tools, and Spiral funding.

 CRYPTO X AI: THE ATTENTION WARS (40 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Attention has become a core digital commodity, with algorithms on
major platforms optimizing for and monetizing user focus. Advances in
AI now allow precise measurement of mindshare, and crypto
micropayments coupled with open finance rails are spawning direct,
tokenized attention markets, exemplified by projects like Kaito,
Noise, Loudio, and the Basic Attention Token. This convergence
addresses inefficiencies and rent‑seeking intermediaries in the
attention economy by enabling transparent, pay‑for‑attention
models. Going forward, the space may tip toward a dystopia of
pervasive extraction or a utopia where AI‑powered defenses and fair
compensation restore user control. 

 THE FUTURE OF STABLECOINS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Headline stablecoin metrics like market cap and volume are
misleading, with over 30% of reported volume driven by MEV bots and
32% of supply held by just 20,000 unidentified wallets. The real shift
is happening at the distribution level, where issuers like Circle are
paying out over half their revenue to partners like Coinbase to drive
adoption.

 GROWING BTC RESERVE REQUIRES CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 VanEck's head of digital assets, Matthew Sigel, said at Bitcoin 2025
that sustainably expanding the US strategic Bitcoin reserve requires
targeted Congressional legislation, ideally through budget
reconciliation amendments offering mining tax credits and other
incentives, rather than executive actions that risk legal challenges.
He suggested starting with a $100 million allocation in the Exchange
Stabilization Fund and gradually growing the reserve via incentives
for miners using methane gas. This approach follows President Trump's
March executive order that established the government's nearly 200,000
BTC reserve under budget-neutral acquisition rules. 

 CHAINLINK TVS CONTINUES EXPONENTIAL GROWTH (2 MINUTE READ) [11]

($5.5B TVL), Kamino Finance ($2B), Jupiter Exchange ($2.7B), and CIAN
Protocol ($900M), as well as continued growth from long-time users
like Aave.
