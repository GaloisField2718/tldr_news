MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN'S BREAKOUT STALLS AS OVERHEAD SUPPLY CAPS GAINS (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Glassnode shows BTC's early January breakout fizzled as the price
failed to clear a dense band of breakeven-level supply near $98,000.
While onchain metrics and subdued derivatives activity suggest
consolidation in a low-participation market rather than a decisive
bear turn, fragile macro conditions and nearly $1 billion in combined
spot ETF outflows mean upside needs stronger, broad-based demand to
absorb the overhead supply. 

 FARCASTER ACQUIRED BY NEYNAR AFTER FOUNDERS PIVOT (4 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Neynar, a Farcaster-focused infrastructure provider, announced it
will acquire Farcaster, a decentralized social protocol. Founders
Varun Srinivasan and Dan Romero will step back from day-to-day
operations. Despite raising $150 million from Paradigm and a16z in
2024, Farcaster acknowledged in December that it failed to achieve
sustainable growth after 4.5 years of pursuing a social-first
approach. The acquisition will transfer ownership of Farcaster's
protocol contracts, repositories, flagship app, and the Clanker
project to Neynar, which will handle protocol governance and
infrastructure operations.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 LASER DIGITAL LAUNCHES TOKENIZED BITCOIN YIELD FUND (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Nomura's crypto subsidiary, Laser Digital, launched the Bitcoin
Diversified Yield Fund SP (BDYF), the world's first natively tokenized
Cayman-domiciled Bitcoin yield fund targeting institutional and
accredited investors. The fund aims to generate over 5% excess net
returns above Bitcoin performance through market-neutral strategies,
including arbitrage, lending, and options, while maintaining long-only
BTC exposure with institutional-grade risk controls. Unlike
traditional tokenized fund structures that use SPVs or feeder funds,
BDYF issues tokenized share classes directly at the main fund level,
enabling true on-chain ownership alongside traditional shares. 

 WALLETCONNECT ADDS TRON TO 600+ WALLETS AND 70,000 DAPPS (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 WalletConnect now supports TRON, giving 600+ WalletConnect-enabled
wallets and 70,000 dApps direct TRC-20 stablecoin access and native
DeFi/NFT integrations. The partnership leverages TRON's USDT
throughput (an estimated $7.9 trillion in 2025 and about $21 billion
in stablecoin transfers per day) to broaden fast, low-cost
cross-border, merchant, and institutional payments via existing
custodians and integrations like Ingenico without extra developer
work.

 PRIVACY ELITE: THE MUST-FOLLOW PRIVACY & SECURITY LIST (1 MINUTE

 A curated “Privacy Elite” roster that groups top privacy

anyone tracking privacy and security developments in crypto. 

 ARK INVEST ON CRYPTO'S NEXT GROWTH PHASE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ARK Invest projects the digital asset market could reach $28 trillion
by 2030, with Bitcoin capturing approximately 70% market share at
roughly $16 trillion, as institutional adoption accelerates with US
ETFs and public companies now holding 12% of total supply (up from
8.7% in early 2025) while demonstrating historically shallow
drawdowns. DeFi applications generated a record $3.8 billion in
revenue during 2025, with ultra-efficient platforms like Hyperliquid
achieving $800 million annually with under 15 employees, while
tokenized assets tripled to $19 billion and could expand to $11
trillion by 2030. Regulatory clarity remains the critical factor that
will determine whether these growth projections translate to
mainstream adoption.

 CONVEX AND CONCAVE DISPOSITIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vitalik Buterin introduces a decision-making framework that
distinguishes "concave disposition" (favoring compromise/middle
ground) from "convex disposition" (favoring commitment to extremes),
using Bitcoin's all-or-nothing approach to decentralization versus
Ethereum's pragmatic willingness to accept tradeoffs as primary
examples. He argues most real-world decisions are multidimensional
"saddle points" that are simultaneously convex in some dimensions and
concave in others, meaning effective protocol design requires
identifying which aspects demand purity versus which benefit from
balance. The framework challenges the crypto industry's tendency
toward single-dimensional thinking in governance debates. 

 PANTERA BLOCKCHAIN LETTER: MARKET OUTLOOK 2026 (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 2025 was a macro and flows-driven year rather than
fundamentals-driven, with crypto markets experiencing historic stress
culminating in an October 10 liquidation cascade that exceeded $20
billion in notional positions – larger than both Terra/Luna and FTX
unwinding events. Performance data revealed extreme market
concentration with Bitcoin declining 6% while the median token in the
top 400 fell 79%, and the broader altcoin basket (excluding
BTC/ETH/SOL) dropping 59%. Market dynamics were attributed to
positioning effects, policy developments, including the US Strategic
Bitcoin Reserve announcement and GENIUS Act, and Federal Reserve rate
decisions.
