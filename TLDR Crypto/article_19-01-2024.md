 SEC DELAYS FIDELITY‚ÄôS ETHEREUM SPOT ETF, BUT DECISIONS ARE STILL
EXPECTED IN MAY (2 MINUTE READ) [5]

ETF. Originally, the agency had to approve or reject the ETF by

deadline to March 5. While this deadline is only for Fidelity‚Äôs ETF
application, analysts predict that the SEC will make decisions
concerning all Ethereum ETFs by late May.

MONEY LAUNDERING (2 MINUTE READ) [6]

"self-hosted" wallets. The measures are not intended to ban
privacy-enhancing crypto. The agreement is now awaiting formal
approval.

 WHAT ARE PUDGY PENGUINS? (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Pudgy Penguins, one of the most storied NFT collections on Ethereum,
has been on a tear over the past year. It recently eclipsed a $40k
floor price and is closing in on the Bored Ape Yacht Club‚Äôs floor.
This thread lays out how the collection resonates in different ways
among crypto enthusiasts, art appreciators, community builders,
trendsetters, creatives, and meme lovers. From the start, Pudgy
Penguins has garnered a diverse audience of holders from crypto OGs to
pro poker players to famous athletes like Steph Curry. The collection
did this by having a natural broad appeal outside of crypto, fostering
an incredible meme culture that has resulted in billions of Giphy
views, and building a strong brand on social media and with its
physical toys.

 TETHER SNAPS UP MORE BITCOIN, BRINGS HOLDINGS TO $2.8 BILLION (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Tether, the issuer of the third-largest cryptocurrency, USDT, has
added more Bitcoin to its treasury, which now totals over $2.8
billion. While the company primarily backs USDT with the safest
investment instruments possible, like US Treasuries, it uses a small
portion of its profits to purchase and subsequently hold Bitcoin.
Despite past criticism for a lack of transparency and the conclusion
of a two-year investigation by the New York Attorney General, Tether
continues to lead the space in market share and even has recently been
given the seal of approval by traditional finance institutions like
Cantor Fitzgerald. 

 THE RISKS OF RESTAKING (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Restaking, the use of an Ethereum stake to secure multiple networks,
has potential benefits such as increased yields, but it also
introduces several risks. The extra layer of risk could lead to
increased slashing penalties and risks on the restaking layer. Further
complications arise from the additional development of primitives,
increasing complexity and risk. The new risk vectors opened up by this
method have raised concerns within the Ethereum developer community
about their potential impact on the Ethereum consensus.
