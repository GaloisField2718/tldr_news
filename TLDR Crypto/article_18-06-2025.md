MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SENATE PASSES STABLECOIN BILL, TURNING FOCUS TO HOUSE (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill regulating
stablecoins in the United States. The bill mandates full dollar
backing and annual audits for large issuers. It introduces consumer
protections like “super-priority” bankruptcy status. It also
restricts Big Tech firms like Meta and Amazon from issuing stablecoins
without meeting strict criteria. The focus now shifts to the House,
which must decide whether to advance its own bill or adopt the
Senate's version. Trump has signaled that the legislation should be
passed by August. 

 THAILAND APPROVES FIVE-YEAR CRYPTO TAX EXEMPTION (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Thailand has approved a five-year capital gains tax exemption on
crypto sales conducted through licensed digital asset service
providers, effective from 2025 through 2029. The policy is part of a
broader initiative to establish Thailand as a global financial hub and
foster regulated crypto activity under Thai SEC oversight and
FATF-aligned AML standards. Officials estimate the move could boost
economic activity and generate over $30 million in additional tax
revenue. This follows increased regulatory scrutiny, including the
recent blocking of five unlicensed foreign exchanges and expanded
local operations by firms like KuCoin and Tether.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING EIGENCLOUD: UNLOCKING CRYPTO'S APP ERA (20 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 EigenCloud is a developer platform that leverages blockchain's trust
and verifiability benefits across both on and offchain applications.
Powered by the EIGEN token and built on EigenLayer, EigenCloud
integrates Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs) like EigenDA for
data, EigenVerify for dispute resolution, and EigenCompute for
execution. This platform enhances crypto's programmability, allowing
developers to create complex, verifiable Web2 applications while
utilizing blockchain for payments and trust management. 

 JPMORGAN INTRODUCES USD DEPOSIT TOKEN ON BASE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 JPMorgan has launched a pilot of its permissioned USD deposit token,
JPMD, on Coinbase's Base L2. It is positioned as an alternative to
stablecoins for institutional clients, offering 24/7 settlement and
trading. This is the first use of the Kinexys DLT platform on a public
blockchain. JPMorgan also filed a trademark for a broader crypto
platform under the JPMD brand, insinuating deeper crypto ambitions.

 WHAT IT'S REALLY LIKE TO WORK AT COINBASE (SPONSOR) [9] 

 At Coinbase, Product Groups run like individual companies: tight-knit
teams, full-stack ownership, real outcomes. But the mission is
universal. Coinbase is actively seeking exceptional talent to help
increase economic freedom.

 MEV AND THE LIMITS OF SCALING (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MEV spam bots now consume over 50% of gas on major L2s like Base
while paying under 10% of fees, effectively nullifying scaling gains
and raising costs for real users. These bots flood chains with
gas-intensive transactions that rarely execute trades, wasting compute
simply to read prices and compete for MEV opportunities due to private
mempools and lack of efficient bidding. The solution proposed is
programmable privacy and explicit MEV auctions (via TEEs), enabling
bots to backrun securely without spam and restoring blockspace for
actual economic activity. 

 CURRENT STABLECOIN FARMING STRATEGY (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This portfolio targets an average APR of roughly 45% by diversifying
stablecoin farms across seven protocols. Key positions include a 40%
APR allocation on Plasma Foundation's chain, leveraged 62% point
farming on OpenEden, and a delta-neutral 46% yield at Resolv. The
strategy also locks 30% APR for 12 months in Neutrl Labs, taps 20% APR
on Optimism Superstack pools, and outsources 38% APR to professional
farmers via StreamDeFi. A 60% APR position in Usual offers upside but
carries distribution-related risk.

 TRADFI TREASURY ADOPTION WILL PULL WALL STREET AND MAIN STREET INTO
DEFI (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Digital asset treasury strategies using ETH and BTC are quietly
becoming TradFi's first large-scale onboarding to DeFi. As firms like
MSTR and SBET optimize crypto yields and report onchain performance to
public markets, Wall Street will be forced to understand decentralized
protocols. Once institutional interest normalizes DeFi, consumer and
enterprise adoption will follow, enabled by scalable infrastructure,
regulatory clarity, and a shift toward community-aligned, tokenized
internet models. 

 THE ONCHAIN CLOB WARS (25 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A new generation of onchain central limit order book (CLOB) protocols
is leveraging rollup-era innovations, like Ethereum's Dencun blobs,
Celestia DA, and ZK VMs like Succinct SP1 and RiscZero, to deliver
near-CEX performance with trustless, self-custodial execution.
Specialized chains and hybrid rollups achieve sub-second latency and
50-100K+ TPS by combining offchain matching with onchain settlement
and ZK proofs. While centralized exchanges still dominate volume, the
onchain CLOB wars are set to redefine trading with fully transparent,
composable, and user-aligned order books.
