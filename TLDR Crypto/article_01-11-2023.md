MARKETS & BUSINESS

 THESE ARE THE MARKET MAKERS LOOKING TO PROVIDE BITCOIN LIQUIDITY FOR
THE BLACKROCK ETF (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 As BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, progresses towards
launching its spot bitcoin ETF, it has revealed that Jane Street,
Virtu Financial, Jump Trading, and Hudson River Trading could be
potential liquidity providers. Having market makers like this is
crucial, as they are responsible for creating and redeeming ETF
shares, thereby maintaining the product's price. This development is
another step toward the fund's potential launch, with the SEC
currently reviewing BlackRock's application along with others from
Fidelity, ARK Invest, and more.

FORWARD WITH CONTROVERSIAL BULLETIN (3 MINUTE READ) [6]

approval before being enforced. The accounting bulletin demands that
firms that custody cryptocurrency list customer crypto holdings as
liabilities, but has faced backlash from crypto advocates. With the
GAO's ruling, Congress now has the ability to review and disapprove
these rules over a 60 day period.

 DIFFERENT TYPES OF LAYER 2S (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This essay from Vitalik Buterin explains how the Ethereum layer 2
ecosystem is diversifying, with projects migrating from other chains
to become a part of the Ethereum ecosystem. The ecosystem is
witnessing an increase in projects building rollups, layer 1 projects
moving towards validiums, and other new initiatives being launched.
This growing heterogeneity reflects the different needs and strategic
choices of various projects, particularly in striking a balance
between costs, usability, and security. 

 STATE OF THE APPLICATION LAYER (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article discusses the current state of crypto applications,
asserting that much of the space is focused on infrastructure while
there is still sparse user demand. The author argues that applications
offer true value when they provide significant improvement for users,
but so far, most blockchain applications have underutilized potential.
They propose focusing more on proven areas such as stablecoins and
stores of value and simply experimenting at the fringes to learn what
other use cases might gain traction.
