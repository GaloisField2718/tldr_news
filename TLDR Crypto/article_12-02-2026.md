MARKETS & BUSINESS

 HONG KONG EXPANDS CRYPTO RULES TO ALLOW MARGIN TRADING AND PERPS (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission has presented a new
framework that allows licensed platforms to offer crypto perpetual
contracts to professional investors and enables brokers to provide
margin financing using assets like bitcoin and ether as collateral,
subject to strict risk controls. The move aims to deepen liquidity,
improve price discovery, and better integrate traditional finance with
digital assets, signaling Hong Kong's continued push to position
itself as a regulated global crypto hub focused on market quality over
rapid expansion. 

 MALAYSIA TO LAUNCH THREE STABLECOIN AND TOKENIZED DEPOSIT PILOTS IN
2026 (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bank Negara Malaysia's (BNM) Digital Asset Innovation Hub is
onboarding three 2026 pilots: a ringgit stablecoin settlement led by
Standard Chartered Bank Malaysia and Capital A and two tokenized
deposit payment projects led by Maybank and CIMB focused on wholesale
domestic and cross-border payments so BNM can assess monetary and
financial stability, potentially integrate findings with its wholesale
CBDC work, and issue guidance on ringgit stablecoins and tokenized
deposits by end-2026.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ZERO: THE DECENTRALIZED MULTI-CORE WORLD COMPUTER (6 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Zero is a new L1 blockchain that uses heterogeneous architecture to
separate block production from validation through ZK proofs,
eliminating redundant transaction re-execution by validators. The
project claims breakthrough performance via four core technologies
like QMDB (3M state updates/sec) and Jolt Pro (100x faster ZK
proving), and is targeting 2M TPS per "Atomicity Zone" with multiple
zones running in parallel like CPU cores. Zero positions itself as an
alternative to both fragmented L2 ecosystems and
high-hardware-requirement monolithic chains, claiming the architecture
could reduce network operating costs from Ethereum's ~$50M annually to
under $1M. 

 STRIPE LAUNCHING MACHINE PAYMENTS VIA X402 (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Stripe is launching a preview of machine payments to help AI agents
interact without using virtual cards, which do not have the
microtransaction or speed capabilities required at scale. Stripe's
PaymentIntents API allows agents to charge for APIs, MCPs, or HTTP
requests. It is launching with support for x402 on Base using USDC,
with other networks and payment methods coming soon.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE 7 AXES OF PREDICTION MARKETS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are seven key differentiation axes for prediction markets:
product quality, asset variety, capital efficiency, oracles, liquidity
provision, regulatory compliance, and strategic positioning.
Interesting architectures include yield-bearing collateral
implementations and hybrid human/AI oracle systems addressing systemic
reliability weaknesses in current resolution mechanisms. Kalshi's US
regulatory positioning has enabled embedded distribution through
Robinhood and Coinbase, representing a significant competitive moat,
while there are emerging choices between horizontal infrastructure
plays versus vertically integrated approaches. 

 THE PROBLEM WITH CRYPTO ISN'T CRYPTO (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto's current negative public perception – comparable to
post-FTX levels despite pro-crypto political winds – stems from
broader economic anxiety rather than industry-specific failures,
particularly AI-driven job displacement fears that make any financial
speculation messaging toxic to mainstream audiences. Recent
controversies, including Trump family token launches, Epstein-Bitcoin
conspiracy theories, and prediction market culture wars, have
compounded this "vibecession" where technological progress remains
invisible beneath negative sentiment. The Coinbase Super Bowl ad
backlash exemplifies how crypto messaging fails to resonate even with
lighthearted content during periods of general financial anxiety.

 PAYMENTS GIANTS BUILD AGENT RAILS; BUT THEY'RE WALLED GARDENS (1
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Visa, Mastercard, OpenAI+Stripe, Google, Amazon, and PayPal have all
launched centralized, permissioned agent payment systems for delegated
shopping. However, the rails are siloed as they require Visa tokens,
Mastercard credentials, and Stripe flows. They work for human checkout
and break down for agent-to-agent use cases like paying compute, API
access, or realtime data fees. The real unlock is permissionless,
programmable machine-to-machine rails. 

 JOLT: THE ZKVM POWERING ZERO (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Jolt is the open-source RISC-V zkVM powering LayerZero's Zero chain,
which replaces decades-old PCP-based SNARK approaches with sum-check
protocol-based interactive proofs for fundamental efficiency gains.
The design allows developers to prove existing programs without code
changes or specialized circuits, with each instruction specified in
approximately 10 lines of Rust. LayerZero's production implementation
(Jolt Pro) achieves 1.61GHz per cell on CUDA GPUs with a roadmap to
4GHz by 2027, with a planned migration to lattice-based cryptography
for post-quantum security.
