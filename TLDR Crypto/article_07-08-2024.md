 SEC CLAIMS COINBASE'S SUBPOENA FOR MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS IS A WASTE
OF TIME (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The SEC has criticized Coinbase for excessively subpoenaing
documents, including emails from Gary Gensler, labeling the demand as
unnecessary and irrelevant to the case. It claims that it has already
provided over 240,000 documents and that meeting Coinbase's request
for millions more would involve an impractical review of potentially
privileged communications, far exceeding the actual case requirements.

READ) [6]

 HOW JAPAN'S INTEREST RATE MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED CRYPTO (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 A small 25 basis point interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan
triggered a massive sell-off in risk assets, including a sharp drop in
Ethereum, due to the unwinding of the carry trade. This trade, where
investors borrow cheap Yen to invest in higher-yield assets, is now
collapsing as higher interest rates strengthen the Yen, forcing
traders to sell assets to cover their more expensive Yen-denominated
loans, leading to a cascade of liquidations.

MINUTE READ) [9]

 BITCOIN'S DIGITAL GILDED YEARS ARE A WAY OFF YET (3 MINUTE READ) [11]


 The recent collapse of the Japanese yen carry trade reminds investors
that Bitcoin, once viewed as a potential hedge against traditional
market swings, remains deeply influenced by broader financial trends.
Despite high hopes for a crypto boom this summer, Bitcoin's
significant market losses suggest that its future as "digital gold" is
far from certain, and further pain might be on the horizon as global
markets continue to adjust.
