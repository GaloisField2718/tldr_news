MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SHIB, WIF CLIMB 60% AS SHORTS LOSE BETTING AGAINST MEME COINS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Short-sellers collectively lost $50m as leading memecoins surged in
price. PEPE, WIF, and BONK all hit all-time highs over the weekend -
even Doge saw price gains. Memecoins, only recently stepping into the
spotlight as legitimate speculative bets, have rapidly been gaining
traction as an asset class not to be overlooked by investors and
speculators. 

 BITCOIN ETF MANIA IS BOOSTING BLACKROCK AND FIDELITY, WHICH TOGETHER
HAVE CAPTURED 79% OF INFLOWS INTO â€˜NEWBORN NINEâ€™ (2 MINUTE READ)
[6]

Origin Bitcoin Fund have emerged as the leaders of the spot Bitcoin
ETF race so far. These two funds have captured 79% of total inflows

Experts expect further concentration among the top ETFs and continuing
fee wars as time goes on.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 UNISWAP LIMIT ORDERS (1 MINUTE READ) [7]

READ) [8]

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE REAL "NEXT L1 TRADE": MEMECOIN SUPERCYCLE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread lays out a thesis for memecoins being the next big trade,
mirroring the L1 trade of last cycle. Memecoins have parallels to L1s.
L1s' proliferation led to a few winners and many losers. The L1s that
won mostly did so by winning the attention game. Memes are similar,
except that they are more of a pure attention play. 

 LIQUIDATION CASCADES AND FLUSHES (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This thread walks through strategies investors can utilize during
market "flushes" or sudden downturns. These moments provide a good
opportunity to invest in the strongest-performing assets. Strategies
for investing include mechanical scalps, known as knife catching,
which requires careful handling. The use of alerts, lists, and
screeners is also recommended for staying organized and identifying
what to buy after the dip. Investors need to have a solid plan and a
good understanding of market dynamics.

 NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT FINES BINANCE $10B FOR â€˜ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONSâ€™
(2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Nigerian Government is fining Binance $10 billion for profits
gained from what it deems as illegal transactions. The decision
follows the recent detention of Binance executives as part of a larger
crackdown on unpaid taxes and unregistered exchanges. This is in
response to concerns that Binance's actions are destabilizing the
Nigerian economy at a time when it is trying to stabilize its
currency. 

 WHAT THE FUTARCHY (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article dissects the concept of Futarchy and prediction markets,
particularly in the crypto world. Futarchy is a proposed form of
government where decisions are based on prediction markets - betting
on potential outcomes. Although seen as a potential blend of public
participation and professional analysis, challenges exist with this
kind of system such as market manipulation, noise differentiation, and
potential biases. The author offers insights into actual experiments
of these concepts in the crypto space, stressing the 'human element'
meeting 'professional analysis.'
