 UBS LAUNCHES TOKENIZED MONEY MARKET INVESTMENT FUND ON ETHEREUM (1
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 UBS has launched its first tokenized money market fund, uMINT, on
Ethereum, joining financial giants like BlackRock and Franklin
Templeton in exploring RWA tokenization. This move aligns with growing
investor interest in blockchain-based financial products, with
tokenized assets on Ethereum reaching over $3B. 

 TRUMP'S ODDS FALL 10% FROM HIGHS ON POLYMARKET, KALSHI WHILE 'WHALE'
DENIES POLITICAL AGENDA (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Donald Trump's odds of winning the presidency have decreased by more
than 10% on prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket. Recent lows show
that his lead over Vice President Kamala Harris is narrowing. A French
bettor who placed large pro-Trump bets denies having any political
agenda, claiming his interest is purely financial based on his
assessment of Trump's chances (~80-90% chance of winning).

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SUPERSTATE INTRODUCES CONTINUOUS PRICING, OFFERING 24/7/365 FUND
MANAGEMENT (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Superstate, a tokenized fund management platform from the creator of
Compound, has introduced a continuous pricing model for its USTB
tokenized treasury fund. Any time of the day, inventors can purchase
and redeem USTB based on the up-to-date net asset value. Blockchain
allows for instant settlement and continuous interest accrual, two
significant benefits over traditional financial instruments. 

 VIRTUALS LAUNCHES BOT DEPLOYMENT PLATFORM (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Virtuals has created a pump.fun-esque website for deploying tokens
that turn into bots once they reach a certain market cap. 244 tokens
with millions of dollars in trading volume were created within 12
hours of launch. The “AI Journey to Sentience” will unlock new
capabilities at market cap milestones, including a forum chat, X
account, and onchain wallet.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WEB 4.0: THE AGENTIC WEB (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The “Agentic Web” is where autonomous AI agents operate as
sovereign entities on blockchains - a convergence of AI and
decentralized systems that enable independent agent-to-agent
interactions and transactions. This piece argues for a multi-layered
system combining blockchain namespaces, federated networks, and
multi-agent architectures and introduces novel concepts like
agent-owned liquidity and onchain inference markets. The internet will
go from being human-centric to an intelligent substrate where personal
models customize each interaction. 

 DIVING INTO EIP 7702 (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Ethereum Pectra upgrade, scheduled for Q1 next year introduces
EIP-7702, which will enable traditional externally owned accounts
(EOAs) to temporarily function as smart contract accounts. This allows
users to experience the advanced functionality of Account Abstraction,
including features like transaction batching, gas sponsorship, session
keys, passkeys, revocability, and improved cross-chain UX, without
requiring them to permanently adopt smart contract accounts.

 'I DROPPED THE EIGENLAYER ADVISORSHIP' — ETH FOUNDATION'S JUSTIN
DRAKE (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake has announced his
resignation from his advisory role with the Eigen Foundation. He left
the Ultra Sound team to focus exclusively on Ethereum's layer-1
network and maintain neutrality. This decision comes after the
controversy and backlash from the Ethereum community over perceived
conflicts of interest. Drake will now adopt a personal policy of
declining all advisory and investment roles beyond the Ethereum
Foundation's new conflict-of-interest guidelines. 

 THE ARGOT COLLECTIVE: A CREDIBLY NEUTRAL HOME FOR ETHEREUM CORE
INFRASTRUCTURE (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Argot Collective, a non-profit group formed by 25 Ethereum
Foundation members, hopes to provide a credibly neutral home for
Ethereum's core infrastructure by supporting projects like Act,
Solidity, and Sourcify via a democratic, flat governance model. Funded
by an Ethereum Foundation grant (expected to last 5-10 years), Argot
will operate transparently, avoid profit-driven models, and achieve
full legal autonomy by mid-2025, strengthening diversity and
decentralization within the Ethereum ecosystem.
