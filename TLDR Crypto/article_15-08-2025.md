MARKETS & BUSINESS

 US GOVERNMENT WON'T BUY BITCOIN, WILL RETAIN SEIZED ASSETS (6 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that the US government
will not purchase additional bitcoin for its Strategic Bitcoin
Reserve, contradicting market expectations of active government
accumulation, though it will continue holding seized assets currently
valued at $15-20 billion and add future confiscations. The
announcement represents a significant policy clarification, as the
government will maintain its existing ~198,000 BTC holdings from
criminal forfeitures but won't engage in market purchases to expand
the reserve. Following Bessent's comments and hotter-than-expected
inflation data, bitcoin dropped over 4% from above $121,000 to below
$118,000, with broader crypto markets seeing similar declines. 

 SPOT ETH ETFS ADD $729M IN SECOND-BIGGEST DAILY INFLOW (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs pulled in $729.1M on Wednesday, the
second-largest daily inflow since launch, led by BlackRock's ETHA with
$500.9M. The increase follows Monday's $1.02B record and Tuesday's
$523.9M, pushing ETH to $4,743, just shy of its all-time high. With
Standard Chartered now targeting $7,500 by year-end, ETF demand is
helping cement Ethereum's role as a cornerstone of institutional
crypto exposure.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING THE GEMINI WALLET (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gemini launched a self-custody wallet featuring a hybrid design that
functions as both an embedded wallet for dApps and a portable wallet
for users, powered by passkey authentication to eliminate seed phrases
and app downloads. Gemini Wallet includes gas fee sponsorship from
launch partners Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and Base, free ENS
subdomains for all users, and integration with the Gemini exchange for
seamless trading once fully deployed later this year. Key partnerships
with Blockaid for security, WalletConnect for connectivity, Bungee for
cross-chain swaps, and Morpho for DeFi yield opportunities demonstrate
Gemini's comprehensive approach to wallet infrastructure. The launch
represents Gemini's strategic push into self-custody solutions,
positioning passkey-based smart wallets as the key to onboarding
mainstream users by removing traditional crypto wallet friction
points. 

 COINBASE CUTS USDC ON-RAMP FEES ON BASE AS CIRCLE BUILDS STABLECOIN
L1 (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Coinbase and Mercuryo have partnered to slash USDC on-ramping fees by
~50% for MetaMask users on Base, as Circle plans a USDC-native Layer
1. The move comes amid growing institutional interest in stablecoins
post-GENIUS Act and Circle's report of 90% YoY USDC supply growth to
$61.3B. With Base gaining traction and Circle leaning into vertical
integration, USDC is positioning as the central rail for
stablecoin-native infrastructure.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AUTONOMOUS AGENTS WILL BE ETHEREUM'S POWER USERS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI agents are becoming increasingly prevalent across our society.
However, they remain limited in functionality and without the ability
to pay for API calls, storage, or services. x402, an open payments
protocol from Coinbase Developer Platform, aims to create a way for
agents to pay for services across the internet via onchain
microtransactions. It uses the HTTP 402 status code “payment
required” to allow any service on the internet to gate access behind
a crypto paywall, which can be seamlessly paid by agents. Applications
include agents that run autonomous businesses, pay for their own
upkeep, and web browsers paying to read gated content. x402 and
Ethereum will be the backbone for the first “proto-digital
lifeforms.” 

 PANTERA BLOCKCHAIN LETTER: DAT VALUE CREATION (50 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Pantera has deployed over $300 million across DAT companies that
generate yield to grow net asset value per share, with its BitMine
investment gaining 1,100% in one month while becoming the largest ETH
treasury globally. There is a prediction market renaissance driven by
Polymarket and Kalshi's success, regulatory clarity, and growing
retail speculation demand, expecting growth in markets with high
frequency, leverage, and outcome value. Crypto markets are entering
"phase 2" of the bull cycle, where altcoins historically outperform
bitcoin and account for 55-66% of total market growth, with regulatory
tailwinds now extending beyond Bitcoin to benefit altcoins through
initiatives like the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STABLECOINS, TOKENIZED DEPOSITS, AND CBDCS AREN'T COMPETING, THEY'RE
CONVERGING (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and wholesale CBDCs serve distinct
roles but are converging on a shared onchain financial infrastructure.
Stablecoins (e.g., USDC) power global payouts and treasury ops for
startups and SMBs, tokenized deposits from banks like JPMorgan offer
regulated USD rails for corporates, and CBDCs provide 24/7 settlement
with zero credit risk for institutions. With the GENIUS Act unlocking
regulatory clarity, Global Systemically Import Banks (GSIBs) are
embracing all three formats as complementary rails, making TradFi
backward-compatible with DeFi. The result isn't a winner-take-all,
it's a unified digital money stack. 

 BITCOIN EXTENDS SUMMER RALLY TO HIT RECORD HIGH (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $124,480 on Thursday,
extending its year-to-date gains to 30% driven by two key factors:
widespread corporate adoption of "bitcoin treasury" strategies and
supportive Trump administration policies. The rally was fueled by 165
public companies now holding bitcoin and Trump's executive order
allowing the $9 trillion US retirement market to invest in
cryptocurrencies, with companies like Trump's family media business
raising $2 billion specifically for bitcoin purchases. Analysts note
these bitcoin treasury companies are creating "structural buying
pressure" through debt and equity raises, though they warn of
potential brutal drawdowns if market conditions deteriorate or capital
access tightens.
