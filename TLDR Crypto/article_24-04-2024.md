 PHILIPPINES SEC WORKS TO REMOVE BINANCE FROM GOOGLE AND APPLE APP
STORE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Philippines' SEC has ordered Google and Apple to delist the
Binance app from the Filipino app store, following a push to restrict
access to unlicensed crypto trading platforms and protect the local
economy and investors. This comes after prior warnings, as part of the
SEC's ongoing efforts to regulate crypto activities. 

 BLOCKCHAIN ASSOCIATION AND CRYPTO ACTIVIST GROUP SUE SEC OVER
‚ÄòDEALER RULE' (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The SEC is being sued over the recently finalized Dealer Rule
expansion, which redefined the term to require more crypto
organizations to register with the SEC and comply with securities
laws. The lawsuit argues that the SEC did not address public concerns
and failed to consider the expansion's negative consequences. The
Blockchain Association and Crypto Freedom Alliance of Texas are
advocate groups representing the industry and pushing for better
crypto legislation.

 LIQUID RESTAKING PROTOCOL RENZO ANNOUNCES AIRDROP (2 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Renzo, the second-biggest liquid restaking protocol, has announced an
airdrop to points holders that will take place on April 30th. The
announcement post included a misleading pie chart of the token
distribution. It showed the token distribution in an extremely skewed
way to make it look like the community was receiving a higher
percentage of tokens. The chart has since been deleted.

READ) [8] 

 After months of consideration, Celo has chosen Optimism as the tech
stack for building an Ethereum L2. This decision comes after Celo

 A CAUTIONARY TALE ABOUT ‚ÄòTHE VC PONZI SCHEME' (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Founders should be wary of the VC ponzi scheme, where venture
capitalists pressure startups to raise massive rounds at premature
valuations, only to show paper gains to attract more funds from
limited partners, which they take fees on. To avoid misaligned
incentives, some firms opt for internal capital structures instead of
traditional VC funds, ensuring they only profit from genuine
investment success. 

 DEEP DIVE INTO THE HISTORY OF DEGEN (22 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post explores how Degenchain has grown since its L3 launch on
Base. Degenchain is community-driven and has shifted to a robust
ecosystem with high transaction rates. The history of its native DEGEN
token is traced from a community token on Farcaster, a crypto-native
social network, to its ascent as a primary utility token. Future
catalysts for DEGEN's growth include Coinbase's market influence, Base
network's expansion, potential ETH ETFs, Bitcoin halving, and onchain
events like "Onchain Summer‚Äù.

 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT BIP-420 (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A BIP, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, is a pending upgrade to the
Bitcoin blockchain that has been assigned a number for easy
communication. BIP-420 is related to OP_CAT, an upgrade to Bitcoin's
scripting language that would make smart contracts and zk bridges
possible. The process to upgrade Bitcoin is decentralized and
community-driven, so there must be a consensus from miners and
developers alike to adopt BIP-420.
