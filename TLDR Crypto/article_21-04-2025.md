MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN EYES $139K BY YEAR-END AMID ONCHAIN STRENGTH (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Bitcoin's reaction to macro and industry shocks has shifted from
panic selling to reinforcement of its narrative as a hedge against
traditional assets. A 21Shares report forecasts that a year-end price
of $138,555 is reasonable, given that the current cycle mirrors 2021's
post-China-ban reset, with disillusionment in traditional finance and
rising global liquidity. Onchain metrics, like long-term holder
accumulation, combined with growing spot ETF inflows and clearer
regulation suggest the market remains in a bullish consolidation
phase. 

 CRYPTO LIQUID FUNDS ARE DOWN BAD — AND SHIFTING TO QUALITY TOKENS
(5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Crypto liquid funds incurred losses up to 70% in Q1 2025, driven by
macro turmoil and heavy altcoin exposure. Fund managers focusing on
smaller, high-conviction positions based on fundamentals rather than
momentum are narrowing portfolios to six to ten quality tokens and are
exploring crypto-exposed equities. The shift coincides with
anticipations of clearer US regulation, new liquid vehicles launching,
and venture firms adopting flexible mandates to capitalize on token
market mini-cycles.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHEREUM L1 PROPOSAL: REPLACE THE EVM WITH RISC-V (7 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Vitalik Buterin has proposed swapping the EVM for a RISC-V virtual
machine while preserving Ethereum's account and call abstraction
mechanics. Giving developers direct access to the RISC-V execution
layer, which is used by ZK-EVM provers, cuts provider cycles by
50x-100x and simplifies the execution layer spec by eliminating
complex constructs. Backwards compatibility would be maintained
through dual-VM support or by routing legacy contracts through a
RISC-V-written EVM interpreter. 

 AUTO.FUN: ELIZAOS'S ONE-CLICK TOKEN LAUNCHPAD (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ElizaOS, the team behind the Eliza AI agent framework, released
auto.fun as a fair-launch token platform. It aims to create long-term
incentives and community building through features like liquidity NFTs
minted on graduation, AI-generated content, and the ability to launch
an agent alongside a token. With the ElizaV2 framework launching soon,
the platform will likely become the primary platform for new agent
deployments.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW ETHEREUM CAN WIN (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethereum is undergoing a strategic shift to correct years of
misalignment between long-term principles and short-term execution,
focusing now on scaling the Layer 1, improving UX, strengthening
leadership, and building tighter L1-L2 integration. The Ethereum
Foundation is taking a more active role in coordination and product
direction. The broader community has been encouraged to update its
messaging and mindset to reflect this new era of user-centered,
execution-driven evolution. 

 FINANCIAL FREEDOM & NEOFEUDALISM (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Crypto is regulatory arbitrage rather than an outright improvement
over TradFi. DeFi simply replicates traditional services in
permissionless code to sidestep compliance. There are inherent risks,
including hacks, irreversible losses, and hyper-financialization, that
are “features” of crypto's openness. There might be a shift toward
“neofeudalism,” where crypto whales become decentralized lords
over networked fiefdoms, displacing state monetary control. Building
specialized skills, diversified hard-asset portfolios, and strong
networks are critical to survive in this emerging landscape.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BUILDING ORDERLY ATTENTION MARKETS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Tokenized content is little more than chaotic, creator-dominated
tokens that fail to deliver lasting utility or fair market dynamics.
Orderly attention markets are a novel concept aimed at using external
data or onchain metrics to create a market around social media
engagement and mindshare. Platforms like Noise.xyz's perp markets
driven by Kaito mindshare or Kizzy's bets on post interactions offer
structured speculation but face challenges around data accuracy,
oracle trust, and liquidity. The vision is to formalize attention into
transparent, rule-based markets. 

 AGENTKIT Q1 RECAP (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coinbase Developer Platform's AgentKit had an extremely successful
quarter, with millions of social impressions, over 20k deployed
agents, and 2k+ developers building with AgentKit. Highlights include
a Coinbase SF AI hackathon, launch day support for OpenAI's Agents
SDK, and integrations with other CDP products like Smart Wallets and
Onramp. The product is now in a strong position, with future secret
updates aimed at allowing agents to pay for countless web2 services.
