 THE LESSONS LEARNED AT OPERATION CHOKEPOINT 2.0 CONGRESSIONAL
HEARINGS (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Congressional hearings on "Operation Chokepoint 2.0" highlighted
sharp partisan disagreements over whether the Biden administration
deliberately pressured banks to cut off crypto firms, though both
sides ultimately agreed on the need for clearer banking regulations.
While Republicans accused regulators of overreach, Democrats dismissed
the controversy as political theater, yet there was bipartisan support
for reforms like written guidance and increased transparency. 

 BITCOIN'S ROLE AS A RESERVE ASSET GAINS TRACTION IN US AS STATES
ADOPT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A growing number of US states are proposing Bitcoin reserve
legislation, with Kentucky becoming the 16th state to introduce a bill
allowing up to 10% of excess state reserves to be allocated to digital
assets. These bills coincide with significant institutional
accumulation through Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold over $100 billion in
BTC. While analysts suggest that state-level adoption could trigger a
global race to accumulate Bitcoin as a reserve asset, they also note
regulatory hurdles and volatility concerns hindering government
adoption.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING $IP, THE NATIVE TOKEN OF STORY'S L1 (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Story Protocol's $IP native token will be used as part of its plans
to turn intellectual property into a programmable asset class. The
token features a 1 billion initial supply with 58.4% allocated to
ecosystem growth and community initiatives. It implements a unique
“fair launch” staking mechanism where staking is enabled but
rewards are paused. The protocol aims to create a permissionless IP
exchange network to address challenges in AI training data licensing
and IP monetization, with tokens used for security, gas fees, and
governance rights. 

 ARWEAVE'S COMPUTING PLATFORM AO GOES LIVE ON MAINNET (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Arweave has launched the mainnet for its decentralized computing
platform, AO, after a year-long testnet phase, introducing a
high-speed, parallelized computing environment built on Arweave's
permanent storage network. With this launch, AO's native tokens -
distributed to AR holders and testnet participants - are now
transferable, supporting a broader ecosystem of decentralized
applications and AI-driven autonomous agents.

 MASTERING EFFECTIVE TEST WRITING FOR WEB3 PROTOCOL AUDITS (11 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 This article introduces a structured framework for writing effective
tests in Web3 protocol audits, emphasizing that high code coverage
alone doesn't ensure security. It encourages developers to adopt three
key mindsets - hacker, invariant, and system architect - to identify
vulnerabilities and create more resilient protocols. 

 CRYPTOPUNKS DOMINANCE HAS REACHED A NEW LOCAL HIGH OF 46% (1 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 CryptoPunks' dominance has surged to 46% after dipping to 30% in late
2024 due to hype around token drops from projects like Pudgy Penguins
and Azuki. With those catalysts fading, both CryptoPunks and Bored
Apes are regaining ground, relying on brand value rather than
speculative events - raising the question of whether their dominance
will keep growing, much like BTC in the broader crypto market.
