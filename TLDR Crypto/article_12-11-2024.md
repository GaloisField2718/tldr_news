 FUSION MODULE - EIP-7702 ALTERNATIVE (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Fusion Model enables Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to function

alternative to EIP-7702. The solution allows users to execute complex
operations with a single signature by pre-calculating a companion
Smart Contract Account address for each EOA and appending transaction
data while maintaining full compatibility with existing
infrastructure. The Fusion Module keeps EOAs and SCAs separate while
enabling the immediate implementation of smart account features.
