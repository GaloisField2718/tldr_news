 MULTICOIN CAPITAL IS IN TALKS TO SELL ROUGHLY $100M FTX BANKRUPTCY
CLAIM (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Crypto venture firm Multicoin Capital is reportedly considering
selling its FTX bankruptcy claim valued at approximately $100 million.
This comes as the price of FTX bankruptcy claims has risen, with sales
reaching up to 70 to 80 cents on the dollar. As the claims get closer
to reaching breakeven, more firms and individuals are considering
selling their claims to be able to put their capital to work instead
of waiting out the claims process. 

 MINERS‚Äô BITCOIN PRODUCTION DIPPED IN JANUARY AMID ENERGY
CURTAILMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Severe winter storms have caused significant month-over-month
reductions in Bitcoin production from miners. Major mining firms, such
as Marathon Digital, Core Scientific, and Riot Platforms reported
decreases in their output due to increased energy demands and related
outages. Despite the downturn, some companies are planning to retain a
larger proportion of their Bitcoin due to the upcoming 'Bitcoin
halving', which will decrease blockchain mining rewards.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PANDORA: THE FIRST TOKEN BUILT ON THE ERC404 TOKEN STANDARD (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Pandora recently launched as the first token developed on a new
experimental token standard, ERC404. This unique standard, which
combines elements of ERC20s and ERC721s, supports native liquidity and
fractionalization, and could pave the way for other future
improvements in NFT collections. Although the standard has only
recently been created, it has generated plenty of excitement in the
NFT ecosystem for the potential innovations it could unlock. 

 WEB REGISTRY GODADDY, ETHEREUM NAME SERVICE CONNECT DOMAIN NAMES WITH
CRYPTO WALLETS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 GoDaddy, a leading internet domain registry, has partnered with ENS,
a domain name protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to link their
web domains to their ENS addresses for free. Despite an ongoing court
case between ENS and GoDaddy, both parties see the potential benefit
of working with each other. GoDaddy even hopes to integrate other
blockchains in the future.

 FRAMES: THE LATEST CRYPTO DARLING? (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Farcaster, a decentralized social protocol, recently introduced
Frames, a feature allowing users to create mini apps within their
Farcaster posts. Based on Facebook's OpenGraph Protocol, Frames
streamline user interaction with content, eliminating the need for app
or tab switching. They can enable a variety of use cases such as NFT
mints, polls, video interaction, games, and shopping, simplifying the
user experience. 

 A SHORT WRITE-UP ON RAAS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Dymension is launching its mainnet and a native token with an
innovative airdrop approach, rewarding active users across several
ecosystems. Dymension (the protocol) brings a fresh approach to
blockchain scalability issues by introducing RollApps - modular
rollups on the Cosmos network. This is an interesting innovation for
rollups, which are designed to improve transaction efficiency, that
could allow more projects to deploy their own rollups.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ON INCREASING THE BLOCK GAS LIMIT (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post details a proposal to enhance Ethereum's efficiency by
optimizing block size, chiefly by increasing the price for nonzero
calldata bytes and the block gas limit. The changes aim to shrink and
stabilize block size, facilitating further blobs addition and easing
the transition to using blobs for data availability. It also prepares
Ethereum for Verkle upgrades and reduces the risk of reorganizing
blocks. Modification options called out in the post focus on varying
calldata costs, introducing 2D pricing for calldata, and offering an
'EVM Loyalty Bonus'. 

 FREEDOM TO EXIT (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article discusses the concept of data ownership and freedom to
exit - the ability to transfer personal data from one service to
another. Currently, many Web 2.0 platforms do not allow this and have
even been known to deplatform individuals, leaving them without their
followings. Three potential solutions include decentralized protocols
that distribute data across multiple peers, local-first data which
stores data directly with the user, and legal agreements that ensure a
user's right to access their own data.
