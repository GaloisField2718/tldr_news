MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ADD $2.5B WEEKLY, ETHEREUM LEADS (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Global crypto investment products recorded $2.48B in net inflows last
week, led by $1.4B into Ethereum funds versus $748M for Bitcoin.
August inflows totaled $4.37B, bringing the YTD figure to $35.5B,
though assets under management slipped 10% because of price decreases.
Solana ($177M) and XRP ($134M) products also attracted inflows, with
optimism building around potential U.S. spot ETF launches. 

 BITCOIN'S ROUGH AUGUST, AND WHAT SEPTEMBER MIGHT BRING (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin declined 8% in August to around $108,000, erasing its summer
rally and falling below Memorial Day levels, while ETH surged 14% for
the month in a stark performance divergence. The capital flow dynamics
favored ether heavily, with ETH ETFs attracting $4 billion in inflows
through August 28 compared to just $629 million for Bitcoin ETFs,
particularly significant given Ethereum's much smaller market
capitalization relative to Bitcoin. This performance split reflects
limited capital availability in the current tight monetary and fiscal
policy environment, where higher tariffs and restrained Fed policy
constrain overall investment flows into crypto assets. Historical
seasonality patterns suggest September could bring continued pressure
for Bitcoin, which has declined in eight of the past twelve Septembers
since 2013 with an average negative return of 3.8%, though the small
sample size limits the statistical significance of such seasonal
indicators.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SONIC LAUNCHING EXCHANGE-TRADED PRODUCT (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sonic Labs received 99.99% approval from token holders to issue $200
million worth of S tokens for expansion into traditional finance,
including $100 million for a Nasdaq PIPE vehicle strategic reserve and
$50 million for an S token-tracking exchange-traded product with a
regulated provider managing over $10 billion in assets. The blockchain
company will establish Sonic USA LLC with $47.7 million in tokens to
hire a New York-based team and engage in Washington lobbying. This
move stems from Sonic's inherited tokenomics problem from its Fantom
rebrand, where the foundation held less than 3% of token supply
compared to the typical 50% allocation, preventing strategic
partnerships due to insufficient token availability. The S token has
declined 69% since its January launch, prompting Sonic to implement
deflationary measures through increased gas fee burns to offset the
new token issuance and create long-term supply pressure. 

 FLYTE AI PRODUCT UPDATES (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Flyte AI is an API that allows anyone, including AI agents, to book
flights and travel using crypto. It is currently being tested with the
Base App to be included as an AI agent messaging bot. Simultaneously,
Flyte is focusing on externalizing its API so that anyone can
integrate it into their own apps or agents. The biggest problem to be
solved is refunds and payment escrows.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE DARK SIDE OF PREDICTION MARKETS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Oracle misfires in platforms like Polymarket, often powered by UMA,
have led to markets resolving in favor of whales despite contradictory
evidence, costing retail millions. Examples include markets on
TikTok's ban, Zelenskyy's suit, and the Ukraine-Trump mineral deal,
all settled controversially. Prediction markets are closer to gambling
than investing, and one should be cautious with bankroll management,
event selection, and profit-taking strategies. 

 APPLE CHAIN AND GOOGLE CHAIN (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google's announcement of a Layer 1 blockchain product has reignited
interest in corporate blockchain adoption, marking a shift from the
failed "innovation lab" experiments of 2015-2020 to practical
utility-focused implementations. Unlike previous corporate blockchain
efforts that aimed for decentralization, the current wave represents
"Web2.5" adoption, where major tech companies like Apple (using
blockchain-like transparency logs for AI privacy), Robinhood
(tokenizing stocks for geographic arbitrage), and Stripe (building
stablecoin infrastructure) are leveraging blockchain technology to
solve specific business problems and expand their bottom lines. This
pragmatic approach focuses on cold utility rather than ideological
goals, with potential applications including AI agent payment
infrastructure, verifiable content timestamping against deepfakes, and
public company L1s serving as developer platform ecosystems. The trend
suggests that real blockchain adoption at scale may come through
corporate infrastructure rather than permissionless protocols,
representing practical innovation over revolutionary disruption.

 PROOF-OF-BURN AS SOCIAL + ECONOMIC LEVER (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 BETH isn't a typical token - it's more like proof you've burned ETH.
Apps, clubs, or experiences could require BETH for access, driving ETH
burns and reinforcing its deflationary design. Its success hinges on
whether builders create experiences people value enough to burn ETH
for, turning scarcity into both a social and economic force. 

 PREDICTION MARKET BUILDERS: TOOLING VS. NEW PLATFORMS (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 A trend is emerging in prediction markets with most builders falling
into two camps: tooling/wrappers for Polymarket and Kalshi (like
Betmoar, PolyData, HashDive, Polysights, Fliprbot, and Polycule), or
new platforms like Myriad, Melee, and Limitless, which innovate on
existing models. The edge for apps built on top of Polymarket/Kalshi
is instant liquidity and broader markets, while new entrants face the
uphill battle of solving liquidity via market-making vaults or hybrid
models. The ecosystem is still early, with many launches ahead and
dashboards now tracking the space closely.
