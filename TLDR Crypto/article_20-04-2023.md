COINBASE GETS BERMUDA LICENSE, PLANS TO LAUNCH OFFSHORE EXCHANGE IN
COMING WEEKS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/dXLew?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

Coinbase has secured a license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority to
expand its international business amid increasing hostility from US
regulators towards the crypto industry. Potentially as early as next
week, the company is planning to launch an offshore derivatives
exchange in Bermuda, targeting perpetual swaps and other
crypto-related derivatives largely unavailable in the US due to
regulatory restrictions. This move could position Coinbase to
challenge Binance's dominance and diversify its revenue base. While an
immediate exodus of major US crypto firms is unlikely, this is yet
another sign that the industry is increasingly considering alternative
locations like Hong Kong, Dubai, and Singapore as primary places of
business. 

INSTITUTIONS FLOCK TO ETHER AFTER SHAPELLA UPGRADE (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/19/institutions-flock-to-ether-after-shapella-upgrade/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Subsequent to Ethereum‚Äôs Shapella upgrade implemented on April 12
institutional activity in Ether futures have risen by 39% on the CME,
indicating, perhaps, that institutional interest increased with the
successful transition to Proof of Stake. In addition to putting the
risk of a failed upgrade behind us, the upgrade also reduces staking
risks by allowing immediate withdrawals of locked coins. This creates
an attractive yield instrument for institutions to work with, whether
they deploy delta-neutral yield strategies or are just looking to
juice their returns on ETH with extra yield. Ether's price increased
sharply after the upgrade, and the futures basis widened, suggesting
leverage has been allocated to the bullish side.

to get into the institutional game in the US, offering secure,

exchange, reducing risks and ensuring compliance amid increased US
regulatory scrutiny.

WHY PRIVACY FAILED (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://zeeprime.capital/why-privacy-failed-zk-part-2?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This article discusses the challenges of privacy adoption, emphasizing
that privacy has not failed but is hampered by a lack of captivating,
marketable products. It highlights the importance of balancing user
experience, alignment with government/society, and minimizing social
anxiety. Importantly, privacy is considered a feature, not the product
itself, and compelling products must be complemented with privacy
features. This article suggests that compliant privacy solutions,
which work in harmony with existing institutions and societies, will
ultimately be more successful than ungovernable, fully private
solutions and can be done with ZK tech in a way that is palatable to
all parties involved. 

WEB3 DEVELOPMENT REPORT (23 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.alchemy.com/blog/web3-developer-report-q1-2023?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


The Alchemy Q1 2023 developer report is out, and it shows that web3
development achieved new milestones despite market challenges. ETH
prices rallied off the lows and developer activity on Alchemy, a
decent proxy for ETH itself, reached all-time highs. The count of
decentralized apps grew by 9% in the quarter, totaling 17,564 across
all chains. Key dapp growth categories included web3 Collectibles
(25%), DeFi and Exchanges (19%), and web3 Social (17%). The quarter
also witnessed an L2 boom, testnet activity growth, and increased
demand for wallet security tools. While there has been a lot of
negative news in the market over the quarter, this report highlights
strong underlying fundamentals that are headed in the right direction.

OPTIMISTIC RELAYS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM (20 MINUTE READ)
[https://frontier.tech/optimistic-relays-and-where-to-find-them?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Around 90% of Ethereum POS blocks use MEV-Boost, increasing proposer
profits by 55%. However, this article highlights why the current
design has issues with latency and high operating costs. Optimistic
relays address these shortcomings by assuming honest behavior from
block-builders, offering three design improvements: Optimistic
Relaying v1 removes simulation latency, benefiting relays, builders,
and proposers but increasing operating costs for relays; v2 removes
block delivery latency, reducing colocation incentives; and v2.5
eliminates block downloads, reducing reliance on relays but impacting
data availability. These designs are considered the inevitable future
due to increased proposer profits, lower costs, and movement towards
ePBS. 

CONSIDER THE CHROMIE SQUIGGLE: AN EXPLORATION OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS
ON-CHAIN GENERATIVE ART NFT (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://pageone.gg/p/consider-the-chromie-squiggle?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Chromie Squiggles, a collection of generative art NFTs created by Art
Blocks founder Snowfro, have gained prominence in the crypto art
movement. Their fun and visually memorable design, early on-chain
generative art genesis story, and connection to Art Blocks and Snowfro
contribute to their appeal. While simple at first glance, there is
actually a great deal of detail embedded in each Squiggle and in the
algorithm as a whole. People often scoff at them, saying they just
look like a simple ‚Äúscribble‚Äù, but this article dives into why
they are not just silly drawings and what makes them potentially
important in the space.
