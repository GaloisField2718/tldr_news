MARKETS & BUSINESS

 THE IMPACT OF THE ETHEREUM ETF ETF (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin and Ethereum have had similar returns since the cycle bottom,
raising questions about whether an ETF would provide much upside.
After accounting for GBTC rotations and conversions of spot BTC to
ETF, the total true net buying inflow from the BTC ETFs was $5B, which
implies $0.84B in net buying for ETH based on analysis. Crypto
natives' expectations for the ETF are overinflated, as Bitcoin has a
better mind share within institutional investment circles while
selling ETH as a tech asset is more difficult. 

 WELCOME TO BEAR TOWN? (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 It is important to identify market inflection points as such moments
can drive 80% of returns in cyclical markets like crypto. Significant
gains can be made by strategically deploying and liquidating assets at
these inflection points. Current market heuristics signal a potential
bearish trend.

 SCROLL ANNOUNCES MARKS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scroll's "Session One" offers users the opportunity to earn "Marks"
by participating in DeFi activities on the Scroll network. It provides
rewards for liquidity provision on specific DEXs and lending or

 REVMC COMPILER OPEN SOURCED (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The revmc compiler integrates Reth and performs between 1.85x-19x on
various EVM benchmarks. It does this by compiling EVM bytecode into
optimized native machine code which drastically reduces the overhead
associated with virtual machine layers. The full article covers how
revmc works, how fast it is, and explains the future roadmap.

 A DEEP DIVE ON ZK COMPRESSION (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ZK compression uses ZK proofs to optimize data storage in blockchain
systems. On Solana, it stores most account data off-chain while
maintaining on-chain verification of transactions via ZK proofs. This
method minimizes on-chain data, thus reducing costs, although it faces
some limitations in execution. 

 WE'RE ALL BUILDING THE SAME THING (75 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most of today's crypto infrastructure, including Ethereum's based
rollups with preconfirmations, Solana's endgame, and modular
approaches like Astria, converge to similar architectures. There are
technical nuances and challenges, like the complexities of Ethereum
preconfs and the risk of shorter block times and timing games. While
universal synchronous composability is valuable, asynchronous
composability may be sufficient for most use cases. Ultimately,
practical experimentation is necessary to determine the most effective
architectures.

for Protocol Guild. The LayerZero Foundation will match donations up
