MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CONGRESSMAN BEGICH'S BITCOIN RESERVE PLAN (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Rep. Nick Begich is pushing the BITCOIN Act, a bill co-sponsored with
Sen. Cynthia Lummis that would make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset
and direct the US to acquire one million BTC over five years using
budget-neutral strategies, citing its role in securing the country's
economic future. America's balance sheet is overly weighted toward
gold and should emphasize Bitcoin. The proposal, which builds on
Trump's executive order protecting seized Bitcoin from liquidation,
has gained support from crypto leaders including Michael Saylor. 

 SUI GROUP TO LAUNCH TWO STABLECOINS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nasdaq-listed Sui Group plans to issue two stablecoins on the Sui
blockchain in partnership with Ethena (suiUSDe, which offers yield,
and USDi, which does not). The launch, expected by year-end, adds to
growing competition among dollar-pegged tokens.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 STARKNET INTRODUCES BITCOIN STAKING (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Starknet has launched BTC staking via wrapped assets like WBTC, tBTC,
and Liquid Bitcoin, allowing holders to earn rewards while keeping
custody and helping secure its L2 network. The Starknet Foundation is
supporting the rollout with 100M STRK ($12M) in incentives to grow
BTCFi, including borrowing and yield strategies, while Re7 Capital
will introduce an institutional-grade BTC yield product in October. 

 USDC EXPLORING REVERSIBLE TRANSACTIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Circle is examining mechanisms to allow USDC transaction reversals in
cases of fraud or hacks while maintaining settlement finality,
creating tension between immediate transfers and irrevocability that
challenges crypto's foundational principle of permanent, immutable
transactions. The exploration of reversibility aims to help scam
victims and bolster mainstream trust in stablecoins, though it
counters the decentralized model where transactions remain immune from
unilateral changes by issuers or validators, with supporters pointing
to successful examples like Sui validators freezing and returning $162
million during the Cetus exploit. Circle president Heath Tarbert
argues that while blockchain technology may be superior, traditional
finance systems offer benefits not currently present in crypto,
suggesting developers recognize the need for some reversibility,
provided all parties agree.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 CRYPTO'S LODESTAR: FUNDAMENTALS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Despite Bitcoin near all-time highs, nihilistic sentiment pervades
crypto as people recognize predatory market structures, including
memecoins that reward influence over insight, large-cap supply games
with high-FDV low-float launches and structured market-making deals,
and retail-as-exit tokenomics where projects lacking revenue paths
treat tokens as the product. The "revenue meta" represents a
structural shift where speculative premiums compress as wealth rotates
from outsiders to insiders, pushing prices toward fundamental floors
with revenue becoming the baseline for sustainable valuations, similar
to traditional finance, where profitable firms buy back shares when
return on equity outpaces internal rate of return. Crypto's
infrastructure advantages enable unprecedented scaling with Tether and
Hyperliquid achieving over $100 million revenue per employee, while
internet-native distribution through social platforms allows products
to reach 100 million users in weeks, AI-accelerated building enables
solo founders to create serious businesses, and programmable
incentives reward users, creators, and referrers natively. Internet
Capital Markets represent the inevitable evolution toward a single
global layer with native issuance, trading, and settlement of any
asset accessible worldwide, potentially creating millions of
investable internet-native businesses onchain as startup costs
decrease and scaling speed increases. 

 MELEE MARKETS: PERMISSIONLESS PREDICTION MARKETS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Melee Markets addresses the limitations of existing centralized
prediction market platforms that restrict market creation and rely on
market makers for liquidity, typically optimizing only for narrow
events like elections or major sports outcomes rather than capturing
the full spectrum of cultural conversation from breaking news to
everyday opinions. The platform introduces "Viral Markets," a new
primitive that allows creators to launch questions of any kind –
factual or opinion-based – while users speculate through a pricing
mechanism that rewards early and accurate predictions, with
speculators gaining exposure to both the outcome and the market's
growth itself. This design combines prediction market finality with
token-like asymmetric upside, solving the cold start problem that has
constrained the category while offering creators a sustainable way to
monetize influence without reputational risk. At scale, Melee
envisions a permissionless network where creators, speculators, and
consumers crowdsource truth without gatekeepers, positioning
prediction markets as a burgeoning category similar to social networks
where multiple winners can emerge by distinguishing themselves across
different dimensions and vertical niches.

 FIVE POINTS AGAINST TOM LEE'S ETH THESIS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Tom Lee's Ethereum thesis is dismantled across five key arguments,
starting with the stablecoin and RWA adoption claim, where despite
100-1000x increases in tokenized asset value and stablecoin volumes
since 2020, ETH transaction fees remain at 2020 levels due to network
efficiency upgrades, activity migrating to other chains, and
low-velocity tokenized assets generating minimal fees. The critique
challenges Lee's "digital oil" comparison by noting that oil has
traded in the same inflation-adjusted range for over a century with
periodic spikes that revert, making commodity status bearish rather
than bullish for ETH. The institutional adoption argument falls flat
as no major banks have purchased ETH for balance sheets or announced
plans to do so, with analysts noting that banks don't stockpile
gasoline or buy shares in custodians they use. Lee's claim that ETH
will equal the value of all financial infrastructure companies
reflects fundamental misunderstanding of value accrual, while his
technical analysis cherry-picks data to support bias rather than
objectively showing Ethereum in a multi-year range similar to crude
oil, with recent resistance failures and bearish technicals suggesting
potential for extended $1,000-$4,800 trading range driven by saturated
narratives and fundamentals that don't justify valuation growth. 

 THE STABLECOIN DUOPOLY FACES REAL COMPETITION (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Tether and Circle's combined 85% market share is slipping as new
issuers, regulatory clarity under the GENIUS Act, and yield-sharing
models reshape the landscape. Fintechs, exchanges, DeFi protocols, and
wallets now have incentives to launch their own stables or strike
revenue share deals, capturing float revenue that USDT and USDC
traditionally hoarded. Emerging contenders like Ethena's USDe, Ondo's
USDY, PayPal's PYUSD, and bank-issued consortium stables point to a
more fragmented market, where frictionless swaps and homogenized
regulation erode network effects. Banks' eventual entry could dwarf
today's $300B market, making the next phase of stablecoins far more
competitive than the Tether/Circle era.
