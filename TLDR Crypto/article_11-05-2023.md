BINANCE SLAMS US CRYPTO CRACKDOWN AND MAKES BID FOR UK OVERSIGHT (3
MINUTE READ) [https://archive.ph/zfPjS?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

Binance is apparently struggling to operate in the US due to increased
regulatory scrutiny. Its chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillmann,
expressed the company's interest in being regulated in the UK, despite
past clashes with London-based regulators. Binance has faced multiple
lawsuits from US regulators, including the CFTC and the DOJ. While it
is difficult to operate in the US now with its unclear regulatory
framework, Hillmann believes the US will eventually follow Europeâ€™s
lead.

BUILDING TOKEN NETWORKS (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1656305603306983424.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This thread breaks down the components and challenges of creating
token networks. Many teams struggle with coordinating decentralized
actors, leading to naive network coordination and unsustainable
network participation. Poor resource allocation and governance capture
can also hinder growth. To overcome these challenges, teams should
focus on proper coordination frameworks, measure output and impact,
and foster sustainable participation by creating symbiotic
relationships between participants and the network. Ultimately,
building successful token networks requires a shift in mindset from
traditional product development.

CRYPTOVERSE: DIGITAL COINS LURE INFLATION-WEARY ARGENTINES AND TURKS
(3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.reuters.com/technology/cryptoverse-digital-coins-lure-inflation-weary-argentines-turks-2023-05-02/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Cryptocurrencies have become safe havens in countries like Argentina
and Turkey, where high inflation and falling local currencies drive
people to digital currencies. Turkey has the world's highest crypto
ownership rate at 27.1%, followed by Argentina at 23.5%. As local
currencies devalue, investors turn to stablecoins like USDC and USDT,
pegged to traditional assets, for protection against currency
devaluation. Crypto adoption tends to be higher in countries with
capital restrictions, financial instability, and political
instability.
