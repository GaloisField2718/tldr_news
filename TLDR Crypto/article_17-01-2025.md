 HOW TO LAUNCH A BLOCKCHAIN SUCCESSFULLY IN 2025; LESSONS FROM THE
LAST DECADE (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto launches have evolved over the past decade. A successful
launch in 2025 requires mastery of multiple elements, including
pre-launch business development, homegrown applications, and targeted
user acquisition. It is critical to secure a “kingmaker” partner,
maintain high float/low FDV tokenomics, and strategically
decentralize. The current market demands robust infrastructure
partnerships, ecosystem alignment, and superior user experience at
launch, marking a sharp departure from previous eras where technical
innovation alone could drive success.

 MERITS TO DEFAI (1 MINUTE READ) [10]

minimal risk,” AI could unlock broader adoption of DeFi among
non-crypto natives, extending its reach and usability.
