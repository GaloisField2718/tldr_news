 HOW MONEY MOVES ONCHAIN (7 MINUTE READ) [8]

onramping fiat into crypto, swapping tokens within the same
blockchain, bridging tokens across blockchains, and using offramps to
convert crypto back into fiat. It highlights Privy's role in offering
user-friendly solutions which abstract the complexity of onchain

 5 CATEGORIES TO WATCH FOR IN CRYPTO X AI AGENTS (+ EXAMPLES) (11
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Even though most current AI agents are not innovative, frameworks
might be here to stay since they achieve value accrual from any agent
speculation or creation, just like pump.fun. The next innovation for
agents will be by giving them crypto wallets and interacting with
DeFi. Attention-based agents will remain important, and will become
more complex and have greater interactivity. DAOs are poised for a
comeback, this time led by multi-agent systems.

 D/ACC: ONE YEAR LATER (30 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vitalik Buterin's update on the d/acc (decentralized/democratic
differential defensive acceleration) movement highlights its growing
integration with blockchain, particularly in areas like prediction
markets, ZK-SNARKS, and public goods funding mechanisms like deep
funding. The philosophy has expanded beyond its original defensive
focus to include “thrive” technologies, like longevity and solar
energy, and has been adopted by crypto communities due to aligned
values in decentralization and censorship resistance. Buterin
emphasizes the role of blockchain in developing robust funding
mechanisms for public goods, with particular emphasis on new
approaches combining human and AI judgment. 

 A LETTER TO THE HYPERLIQUID CORE TEAM (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Chorus One, a major node operator, has highlighted challenges with
Hyperliquid's blockchain infrastructure, which include closed-source
code, dependency on a centralized API, and an unclear validator
selection process that leads to a black market for testnet HYPE
tokens. 81% of HYPE tokens are controlled by foundation notes, while
external validators face sustainability challenges with low rewards
and high staking requirements. This thread recommends improvements
meant to enhance decentralization, like open-sourcing the code and
redistributing foundation stake.
