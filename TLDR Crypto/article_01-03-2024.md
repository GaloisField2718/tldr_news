 EXPECTED VALUE IN CRYPTO & BUILDING INFINITE BLOCKSPACE (10 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The fat protocol thesis, that most value will accrue to the
underlying chains, is something that has gained popularity - it has
been true so far in the space. Builders are focusing more on
developing new L1 and L2 solutions instead of decentralized
applications or application-focused protocols. This fragmentation
could lead to surplus useless blockspace. Despite blockspace being one
of the valuable aspects of crypto, the continuous creation of new
blockspace could be a waste of resources. This article discusses three
potential outcomes for the future of crypto, underscoring the
importance of changing current dynamics to incentivize more diversity
in the space.
