 TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ESTABLISH A STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE
(1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 President Trump has signed an Executive Order to establish a
Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which will be capitalized with forfeited
federal Bitcoin holdings at no cost to taxpayers, along with a U.S.
Digital Asset Stockpile for other forfeited digital assets. The order
aims to preserve these assets as a store of value and maximize their
worth.

MATCHING STOCKS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has proposed to reclassify
crypto under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act to cap crypto

 INDIAN TOWN MOVES ALL PROPERTY RECORDS TO BLOCKCHAIN (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The Dantewada District Administration has migrated its land records
to the Avalanche blockchain, allowing for transparent and persistent
record-keeping. The records include ownership forms, maps, and plot
registers, and allow owners to instantly prove ownership. 

 SEISMIC: THE ENCRYPTED BLOCKCHAIN (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Seismic is an upcoming blockchain focused on protocol-level
encryption rather than wallet-level privacy, aiming to enable
encrypted transactions between multiple parties. The chain achieves
this by restructuring the chain stack around secure hardware and
cloning EVM memory segments into transparent and encrypted regions,
maintaining encryption throughout state replication. Three initial
protocols have already been developed â€“ NIBBLE for restaurant
revenue sharing, RIFF for music-based bonding curves, and FOLIO for
global pay-it-forward chains.

 PUTTING FLUID ON POLYGON (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new governance proposal aims to deploy Fluid on Polygon with 1.5M
POL tokens allocated as lending incentives, plus around $10M in
stablecoin and $25M in POL/LST liquidity. Fluid will match these
incentives with 1.5M FLUID tokens once the platform reaches $60M in
stablecoin borrows and Polygon's combined DEX volume maintains $2.5B
weekly for two consecutive weeks. 

 INVESTIGATION UPDATES AND COMMUNITY CALL TO ACTION (5 MINUTE READ)

February 21 security breach was a state-sponsored attack by
TraderTraitor, a DPRK-linked threat group. The team has since
implemented extensive security upgrades, restored systems, and is
calling on the Web3 community to enhance security measures
industry-wide.

 THE INTERNET YOU CAN OWN (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin and the ETH/BTC ratio falling to
levels not seen since 2018, prompting a grassroots "Brand Hack"
initiative to address Ethereum's marketing shortcomings. While
Ethereum prioritized decentralization over scalabilityâ€”a technically
sound decision evidenced by its dominance in stablecoin TVLâ€”it has
failed to effectively communicate its value proposition or cultivate
the cultural relevance enjoyed by competitors like Solana. One remedy
is to position Ethereum as "The Internet You Can Own" and implement an
Intel Inside-inspired marketing program, where applications built on
Ethereum would display a certification logo in exchange for financial
and ecosystem support. 

 I SUPPORT 228 BECAUSE I WANT SOLANA TO WIN (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 SIMD 228, a proposal to reduce Solana's token emissions, argues that
the current system creates significant economic inefficiencies by
recycling value from SOL holders back to stakers while exposing
participants to substantial tax liabilities and middleman fees. With
Solana currently emitting approximately 28 million SOL annually (worth
$4.7 billion), reducing these emissions could save the ecosystem
$100-400 million per year that otherwise leaks to governments through
unfavorable tax treatment where staking rewards face ordinary income
rates instead of capital gains.
