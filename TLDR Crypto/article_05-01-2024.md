 GRAYSCALE, VANECK, AND ARK BITCOIN ETFS REGISTER TO TRADE ON
EXCHANGES (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK have obtained listings for their potential
spot bitcoin ETFs on various exchanges, pending final clearance from
the SEC. This is encouraging news as attempts to set up a Bitcoin ETF
in the US over the past decade have been continually rebuffed by the
SEC citing excessive risk for investors. However, many are expecting
positive news of approvals to come any day now. 

 CITI ALUMNI-FOUNDED STARTUP TO OFFER BITCOIN SECURITIES THAT DON'T
NEED GREEN LIGHT FROM SEC (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A former group of Citi executives is planning to offer Bitcoin-backed
securities, bypassing the need for SEC approval. The venture, Receipts
Depositary Corp., will offer depositary receipts that will give
institutional investors direct ownership of the digital assets. This

investments not fully addressed by a possible spot ETF.

 A GUIDE TO NODEMONKES: 10K PIXELATED ORDINALS EXPLAINED (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 NodeMonkes, a project of digital artworks known as Bitcoin Ordinals,
has been the talk of the NFT space since launching last month. These
digital assets are not actually NFTs but Ordinals inscribed on
Bitcoin. NodeMonkes claims to be the first original 10k Ordinals
collection. The team actually inscribed the collection as Ordinals
early last year, giving a large portion of the collection the
‚Äòsub-100k‚Äô inscription status, but waited for more favorable
market conditions to officially launch the project. 

 HOW TO LOSE 99.9% AND STILL SCORE A 500X (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post explores the idea of constant leverage, an automated
investment strategy that can yield high returns while also exposing
the investor to potentially significant losses. Constant leverage is a
commonly used approach in traditional finance markets, with many
structured products built for this purpose. However, these products
typically come with hefty fees. Leveraging DeFi to create similar
products in the crypto space could enhance the returns of this type of
strategy and improve visibility of what is actually going into the
products.
