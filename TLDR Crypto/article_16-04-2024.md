MARKETS & BUSINESS

 HONG KONG SPOT ETFS MAY ONLY HAVE $500M IN INFLOWS (1 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg Eric Balchunas speculates that the
upcoming Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs will not have substantial inflows or
market effects. The ETFs will not be available to Chinese locals, and
the Hong Kong ETF market is only $50 billion. With no big players
involved and less liquidity, the market will be less efficient with
spreads beyond where Bitcoin normally trades. These factors and
relatively high 1-2% fees make this more of a moral victory than a
financial one for Bitcoin. 

 OKX LAUNCHES ETHEREUM LAYER-2 NETWORK IN CHALLENGE TO COINBASE'S BASE
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OKX, a major cryptocurrency exchange, has launched its own Ethereum
layer-2 scaling network called X Layer, built using Polygon's AggLayer
solution. X Layer aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions, as
well as seamless interoperability across different blockchains. The
launch positions OKX as a competitor to Coinbase's Base, another
layer-2 network built on Optimism's OP Stack.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ARBITRUM BOLD RELEASED ON TESTNET (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Offchain Labs has released Arbitrum BOLD on testnet, a new dispute
resolution protocol for optimistic rollups that enhances
permissionless validation and security. Now, anyone can secure claims
about Arbitrum's state on Ethereum, promising increased network
security and democratizing the validation process. Following thorough
testing, including community engagement and a tally vote, BOLD is
expected to further align Arbitrum with Ethereum's decentralization
goals. 

 INTRODUCING SUBSCRIPTION MINTING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Subscription Minting is being launched as a solution to high gas fees
and minting inconveniences, allowing users to prepay for future mints
at lower costs, with the flexibility to opt in or out of specific
mints while still adhering to the established allowlist process. This
system aims to relieve stress for collectors by providing a quick,
secure way to manage mints without bots or season passes, ensuring a
fair chance for all participants.

 RUNES - BITCOIN'S NEW FUNGIBLE TOKEN STANDARD (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Franklin Templeton Digital Assets highlights the upcoming Runes
standard and its significance for Bitcoin. After the success of
Ordinals, which has a market cap of around $2 billion, creator Casey
Rodarmor is introducing Runes as a more efficient version of BRC-20
tokens that better uses Bitcoin's UTXO design. Specifically, Runes
will be entirely onchain, Lightning network compatible, and will not
require wasted UTXO transactions. Bitcoin's current fungible token
market cap is $600 million, but the adoption of Runes could drive it
higher. 

 20 OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE ONCHAIN EXPERIMENTS FROM THE LAST 3 YEARS
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 General Partner at Electric Capital Maria Shen divides her list of
the most innovative onchain experiments from the last 3 years into
four categories. For human coordination mechanisms, she highlights
Nouns DAO for its complex treasury system and spin-off projects and
Curta for its recognition of solving hard problems. In the ‚Äúpricing
historically difficult assets‚Äù category, Love on Leverage prices
momentum during a live dating show and Orb Land allows users to access
Q&As with influencers. Her ‚Äúmarkets for unique assets‚Äù category
includes liquid NFT markets. The final category is for incentive
mechanisms for onchain art, represented by the 5/9 chess engine's
NFT-per-move mechanic.

 SREERAM DISCUSSES EIGENLAYER GOALS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The most suitable asset for staking should be the one that mirrors
the denomination of risk, minimizing cross-volatility risks. Ethereum
is identified as the most common digital asset for risk denomination
in internet-native applications, especially with the rise of Ethereum
rollups. 

 BREAKDOWN OF ‚ÄúAN ANALYSIS OF INTENT-BASED MARKETS‚Äù (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Gauntlet founder Tarun Chitra's recent paper about intents researches
how effort, congestion, and entry costs affect intent markets. To
receive the most tokens during an intent swap, reduced competition
helps since it increases the win rate of solvers, reducing their cost.
A system similar to a Dutch auction can be used to maximize user
utility when there's no possible arbitrage between an onchain AMM and
a solver.
