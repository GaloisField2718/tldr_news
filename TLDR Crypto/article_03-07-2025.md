MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BIT DIGITAL DUMPS BITCOIN FOR $163M ETHEREUM TREASURY PIVOT (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Bit Digital raised $162.9 million through a public share offering to
expand its Ethereum treasury, marking a full pivot away from Bitcoin
mining. The Nasdaq-listed firm plans to convert its 417 BTC into ETH
and build on its 24,434 ETH holdings, which were already worth nearly
$60 million at the end of Q1. The move reflects a growing trend among
public companies using treasury strategies for leveraged exposure. 

 BLACKROCK'S BITCOIN ETF GENERATES MORE REVENUE THAN S&P 500 FUND (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust generated an estimated $187.2
million in annual fees on $52 billion AUM at a 0.25% management fee,
narrowly outpacing the $187.1 million earned by its flagship iShares
Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) despite IVV's $624 billion AUM and 0.03% fee.
Launched in January 2024, IBIT has recorded net inflows every month
except one, making it the largest spot bitcoin ETF. The fund's higher
fee reflects the added complexity of custody, regulatory compliance,
and infrastructure required for bitcoin exposure.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 CIRCLE LAUNCHES GATEWAY FOR CROSS-CHAIN USDC LIQUIDITY (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Circle's Gateway is a new interoperability layer that allows users to
access a unified USDC balance across multiple chains in real time.
Instead of relying on bridges, users can deposit USDC into a
non-custodial contract that syncs liquidity across supported networks
like Avalanche, Base, and Ethereum (testnets launching July). The move
follows Circle's IPO and banking license application, signaling deeper
integration into traditional finance. 

 STABLE LAUNCHES “STABLECHAIN” BUILT FOR USDT PAYMENTS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Stable has launched a dedicated Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for
stablecoin payments, branding itself as the first “Stablechain.”
Powered by USDT as native gas, the chain offers gas-free peer
transfers, ultra-low fees, sub-second finality, and EVM compatibility.
Aimed at users, businesses, and developers, Stable seeks to simplify
cross-border payments and unlock stablecoin utility with tools like a
social-login wallet, USDT-linked debit cards, and enterprise-grade
infrastructure.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE DIGITAL ASSET OVERTON SHIFT (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Crypto's fat protocol era, built on public goods and vague token
value, is collapsing under its own weight as institutional players
embrace profitable, product-first models. Whereas before we had
crypto-native builders clinging to tokens and memes, now there is a
new class of "Digital Asset" firms deploying practical zk tech,
real-world asset protocols, and CEX-native products. The call is
clear: pivot from crypto idealism to pragmatic digital asset
infrastructure or risk irrelevance. 

 THE REAL THREAT TO HYPERLIQUID (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Coinbase plans to launch fully compliant perpetual-style futures for
BTC and ETH in the U.S. on July 21, challenging HyperLiquid's de facto
American perps monopoly by leveraging its 10 million monthly users
versus HyperLiquid's 500,000. However, Coinbase's existing global
perps volume and its recent Deribit acquisition still trail
HyperLiquid, and its track record of entering new markets raises
questions about execution. Decentralized frontends have also begun
bridging US traders to HyperLiquid despite regulatory uncertainty, but
the biggest looming rival is Robinhood, which boasts 15 million MAUs,
deep options-trading experience, and a history of successfully
launching new products.

 SOLANA BOTS AND PUMP.FUN FACE DEEP FREEZE (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Trading bot volumes across Solana have plummeted ~75% from May highs,
with visible outflows of 100K+ SOL last week and cumulative holdings
down 5.26% in two weeks. Simultaneously, Pump.fun volumes continue a
multi-month slide, dipping below $100M over the weekend. The
once-frenzied onchain trading meta is entering a clear cooldown phase.


 COINBASE BUYS TOKEN MANAGER LIQUIFI (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coinbase's acquisition of token management platform Liquifi marks its
fifth purchase in 2025, following deals for Spindl, Iron Fish's team,
Roam, and the industry-record $2.9 billion Deribit takeover. Liquifi,
backed by a $5 million 2022 seed led by Dragonfly and used by Uniswap
Foundation, OP Labs, Ethena, and Zora, offers cap table tracking,
token vesting distribution, and tax withholding tools like Carta. The
move advances Coinbase's goal of an end-to-end token lifecycle
platform, positioning it closer to Binance-style launchpad offerings
and expanding beyond simple trading.
