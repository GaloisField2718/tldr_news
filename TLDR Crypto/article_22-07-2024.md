GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BINANCE HALF-YEAR REPORT 2024 (2 HOUR READ) [8] 

 The crypto market cap grew 37.3% in H1 2024, with significant gains
in L1s, L2s, and DeFi sectors. Notable developments include Bitcoin's
increased dominance post-halving, ETF approvals, the Ethereum
restaking boom, and a surge in L2 activity driven by airdrop
speculation. The second half of 2024's key themes will be Bitcoin
ecosystem developments, ownership economy applications, and real-world
assets. 

 L2 SECTOR PERFORMANCE IN Q2 (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There are now 6x more active users of L2s than mainnet, with Arbitrum
and Base leading the charge at 550,000 and 350,000 daily active
addresses each. Thanks to EIP-4844, ETH fees dropped by $679M, and L2
fees are 13% of Ethereum's, even with 9x more transactions on L2 than
L1. Arbitrum has the lowest transaction fees and value to TVL, while
Base has the most transactions and smart contracts deployed.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE ECONOMICS OF L3S (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 L3s struggle to break even unless they have 50M+ monthly transactions
or fees no more than 3x cheaper than L2s. Their primary use case is as
an economic bootstrapping tool for onchain games and unique
experiences, though they may be running at a loss for their
developers. Applications retain most of the benefits of L3s, but
priority fees and native gas tokens could introduce more value to the
chain. 

 BANANA GUN: KING OF ORDERFLOW (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Telegram bots like Banana Gun, which allow for trading tokens in a
Telegram chat on Ethereum or Solana, are a misunderstood and valuable
business operation. Its 150k users are willing to pay high fees for a
simple UX, and the bot is on track to generate nearly $8 billion in
volume and $60 million in cash flow this year. Its adjusted market cap
is $345 million. It pays 40% of revenue to token holders, using the
rest for expenses and growth initiatives.
