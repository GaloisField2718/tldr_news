creating diversified monetization beyond traditional card programs
[4]. 

By combining payments infrastructure with loyalty economics and
token-aligned incentives, the platform is designed to grow as more
spending flows through its ecosystem, expanding beyond the traditional
card model.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 NOMURA'S LASER DIGITAL APPLIES FOR US NATIONAL TRUST BANK (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Laser Digital, Nomura's digital asset arm, filed for an OCC national
trust bank license to launch institutional crypto custody, spot
trading, and staking. Joining Ripple and Circle, the firm targets
federally regulated infrastructure to meet increasing institutional
demand for secure, governed access to digital asset markets. 

 ALTCOINS JUMP AS DOLLAR SLIDES, BITCOIN HOLDS STEADY (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The Dollar Index fell to a four-year low, breaking below a 2011
trendline, which supported crypto prices with bitcoin holding near
$89,200 and ether topping $3,000. Altcoins significantly outperformed
the majors, with the altcoin-heavy CD80 index posting a 3.7% daily
gain versus 2.47% for bitcoin-dominant CD20. The altcoin strength
reflects typical rotation patterns as bitcoin remains range-bound,
with capital flowing to more speculative assets. Despite the upside,
derivatives markets saw another $230 million in long liquidations over
24 hours, while put options continue trading at a premium to calls
with increased demand for downside hedges at the $85,000 strike.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PREDICTION CAPITAL MARKETS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Despite generating $150B+ in volume and $800M in revenue through
platforms like Pump since January 2024, creator tokens suffer from a
fundamental structural flaw: perpetual onchain instruments tracking
ephemeral attention create perpetual bagholders by design. The lack of
objective resolution mechanisms means winners are determined by exit
timing rather than correctness, enabling manipulation while forcing
creators to absorb direct reputation damage whenever they withdraw
fees or token prices decline. The proposed solution replaces perpetual
creator tokens with time-bounded markets featuring defined speculation
windows and resolution endpoints that match the ephemeral nature of
attention cycles. 

 EIGENCLOUD: VERIFIABLE OFF-CHAIN COMPUTATION (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 EigenCloud introduces a hybrid verification model that combines
Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) with restaking-based economic
security to enable verifiable off-chain computation, addressing the
fundamental lack of transparency in traditional cloud services while
circumventing blockchain's computational limitations. The platform
allows complex operations like AI inference and GPU-intensive
workloads to execute off-chain with cryptographic proof of correct
execution, bridging the gap between Web2 scalability and Web3
verifiability. Its architecture supports familiar developer tools,
including Docker containers and external API calls, requiring minimal
smart contract expertise to implement verifiable applications. Target
use cases span prediction markets, institutional finance, cross-chain
security infrastructure, and AI agent ecosystems where result
verification and trustless coordination are critical.

 THE 7 POWERS IN CRYPTO (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Traditional moats like scale economies, network effects, and
switching costs are being eroded by open-source code and
composability. Certain advantages survive: "Lindyness" (Aave capturing
100x more lending supply than competitors at lower rates due to
multi-cycle security track record), liquidity network effects (Pump's
bonding curve mechanizing tipping points), counter-positioning
(Morpho's isolated markets vs Aave's monolithic approach), and brand
power (CryptoPunks' cryptographically-enforced provenance). Durable
crypto advantage accrues around mechanisms that make ownership
credibly scarce – "internet bearer assets" – where security
history becomes a competitive moat. 

 WHEN NETWORK BECOMES THE MEDIUM (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Blockchain-based art transcends traditional preservation by embedding
creation directly into network infrastructure. CryptoPunks has
generated $3.07B in trading volume and achieved institutional
recognition from MoMA, Centre Pompidou, LACMA, and others, positioning
creators Matt Hall and John Watkinson among top-selling living
artists. Networked art maintained by global consensus may outlive
traditional museums. The Infinite NODE Foundation is launching a Larva
Labs exhibition featuring a live Ethereum node sculpture that
visualizes real-time network activity.

 EUROPEAN STABLECOINS ARE DIVERSIFYING BEYOND THE DOLLAR (1 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 EUR stablecoins reached a $617M market cap in early 2026 (Circle's
EURC alone at $398M), Swiss CHF stablecoins hit $17.7M, overtaking
GBP's $6.1M, and UAH stablecoins total $1.2M with strong local usage.
Europe's stablecoin market is diversifying beyond USD dominance with
clear upside for payments-driven GBP and regional coins. 

 FOLLOW THE FEES: STABLECOIN ISSUERS ARE THE TOLL BOOTH (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 A fee map shows stablecoin issuers dominating DeFi's cashflow. Tether
$417.9M (30D) and Circle $196.2M (30D) lead the leaderboard while
DeFi-native issuers Sky ($33.1M, +31.7%) and Ethena ($23.3M, +14.9%)
are the fastest growers, illustrating that whoever controls on-chain
USD rails captures persistent, pump-proof revenue from settlement,
lending, margin, liquidity, and treasury flows.
