halved rewards and rising mining difficulty. To adapt, companies are
diversifying into AI and computing services or expanding bitcoin

communication frequency about the token. With a transparent vesting

 EXPLORING BASE'S ROLE IN THE GROWING ONCHAIN ECONOMY (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 The onchain economy has experienced explosive growth in 2024, with
weekly transactions up 60% 531 million and TVL increasing 110% to $88
billion. Base has stood out as the leading onchain ecosystem with
daily transactions up 1,900% to 7.7M and stablecoin volume growing
over 8,800% to $55B weekly. Base's rapid adoption has been caused by

positioning the network as a key infrastructure layer for the
expanding onchain economy. 

 TOP 7 AGENT ECOSYSTEMS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The AI agent ecosystem in crypto has evolved into several distinct
architectures, with Virtuals emerging as the leading platform with its
GAME engine for agent-to-agent interactions and over 4,000 agents. The
ecosystem spans different technological focuses: Eliza is Solana's
dominant open-source framework, Holoword has advanced 3D audiovisual
capabilities, and Myshell has significant adoption with 4 million
users across 300 models. Moemate stands out with cross-platform
compatibility in AR/VR, while platforms like vvaifu.fun and CreatorBid
target specific niches on Solana and Base. Multiple platforms are
preparing token launches, and the sector is poised to receive
multi-billion dollar valuations.

 METAMASK CO-FOUNDER: MEMECOINS REVEAL WEB3 AND AI CONSENT FLAWS (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MetaMask co-founder Dan Finlay's memecoin experiment showed flaws in
Web3's approach to consent, trust, and investor expectations similar
to challenges in AI platforms regarding data use without explicit
consent. His findings reveal the need for better tools, incentives,
and infrastructure to create clearer structures, foster trust, and
improve user experience in the memecoin and broader Web3 ecosystems. 

 VAMPIRE DROP (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The "Vampire Drop" strategy for token launches involves incentivizing
users to deposit competitor tokens into vaults in exchange for future
rewards in the project's token. The scheme creates buyer pressure for
the new token while flooding the market with competitor tokens, a
tactic that is likely illegal and highly controversial.
