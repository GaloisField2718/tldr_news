MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN STAYS BELOW $112K AFTER TOUGH JOBS REPORT AND FED CUT BETS (6
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The August US jobs report revealed only 22,000 job additions versus
75,000 expected, pushing Fed rate cut probability to 100% for the
September 17 meeting, yet Bitcoin failed to capitalize on this
typically bullish macro development and remains below $112,000.
Technical analysis shows BTC has confirmed a bearish double-top
breakdown below the $111,982 neckline, with the next support level at
$101,700 around the 200-day moving average. Despite impending rate
cuts, analysts warn that Treasury yield volatility could increase,
potentially creating financial tightening conditions similar to late
2024 when the 10-year yield actually rose from 3.6% to 4.8% even as
the Fed cut rates. The upcoming August CPI data next week is expected
to show continued inflation stickiness at around 2.9% year-over-year,
which could limit the downside in Treasury yields and maintain
pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin. 

 SENATE DRAFT BILL PROPOSES SEC-CFTC JOINT COMMITTEE, DEFI PROTECTIONS
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The latest draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act calls
for a joint SEC-CFTC advisory committee to clarify crypto regulation
and its treatment of tokenized RWAs. The bill explicitly protects DeFi
developers and users from being treated as broker-dealers for running
DEXs, validators, or wallets; exempts Decentralized Physical
Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) from securities laws if sufficiently
decentralized; and clarifies that staking rewards and airdrops are not
securities offerings. Lawmakers aim to reconcile the bill with the
House's Clarity Act and put it on President Trump's desk by year-end.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 JUSTIN DRAKE'S “LEAN ETHEREUM” VISION (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Lean Ethereum is a technical roadmap that succeeds the Beam Chain
project and aims to achieve 10,000+ TPS on Ethereum's L1 while
maintaining full decentralization and chain verification from mobile
devices or browsers. The vision relies on two key technical
breakthroughs: real-time zkVMs that can prove EVM execution in seconds
for under a cent per transaction, and data availability sampling
(DAS), which allows lightweight clients to verify massive blob
throughput without downloading full datasets. Lean Ethereum proposes
comprehensive upgrades across all three layers - execution (EVM 2.0
with SNARK-friendly instruction sets), data (blobs 2.0 with DAS and
post-quantum cryptography), and consensus (beacon chain 2.0 with fast
finality) – unified by hash-based cryptography as the foundational
building block. If successful, the roadmap could position Ethereum as
the dominant "internet of value" and settlement layer, capable of
enterprise-scale throughput while preserving the security and
decentralization properties that distinguish it from other Layer 1
networks. 

 HOW CRYPTO COULD TAKE OVER REAL WORLD PAYMENTS (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 FreePay is an open-source platform that enables in-person crypto
payments through NFC tap technology. It is designed to work with any
wallet, blockchain, or token without requiring proprietary hardware or
apps. The system automatically selects the optimal payment token when
customers tap their phones to merchant terminals, eliminating the
interoperability issues that have plagued previous crypto payment
attempts. FreePay provides merchants with the benefits of cash while
maintaining global accessibility by offering instant settlement, zero
chargebacks, and significantly lower fees compared to traditional
credit card processing.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ON TEMPO, PERMISSIONLESSNESS, L1 VS L2 (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stripe's Tempo blockchain will be a fully permissionless L1 with open
token deployment, transactions, and eventual validation, despite
targeting institutional payment use cases. The team chose to build an
L1 rather than an Ethereum L2 because global payment partnerships
require a decentralized validator set for trust and neutrality,
eliminating dependencies on any single platform or sequencer.
Technical priorities include fast finality, multiple validators,
custom transaction lanes, and stablecoin-focused architecture with
native issuance rather than Ethereum bridge functionality. The
approach represents a bet that mainstream crypto adoption requires
truly decentralized infrastructure rather than permissioned systems,
aiming to onboard traditional payment flows onto permissionless crypto
rails. 

 ETHEREUM RESEARCHERS PUSH FOR FASTER FINALITY (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ongoing Ethereum research to speed up transaction finality includes
shortening slot times, exposing a fast confirmation rule that secures
transactions in 1-3 blocks (10-30 seconds), and refining Gasper/beacon
chain fork choice. Teams are also exploring new consensus mechanisms,
such as three-slot-finality and fast BFT protocols, to cut down
Ethereum's current 13 to 19 minute finality window. The goal is to
bring faster confirmations to apps and infrastructure while
maintaining Ethereum's security guarantees.

 WHY BUSINESSES FIND CRYPTO USEFUL (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Businesses are increasingly adopting crypto solutions. Stripe's new
L1 blockchain Tempo will be a behind-the-scenes infrastructure similar
to SWIFT or ACH rather than consumer-facing technology. Critical
business drivers include instant onchain transfers that eliminate
trapped liquidity during traditional banking delays, lower transaction
fees compared to card payments, improved reliability for cross-border
money movement, and reduced currency conversion requirements.
Stablecoins provide access to USD-based financial functionality.
Regulatory compliance, rather than arbitrage, is now the primary
framework, given formal regulation under the GENIUS Act in the US and
MiCA in Europe. The focus represents a shift toward solving practical
enterprise payment challenges rather than speculative crypto use
cases. 

 PAXOS, FRAX, AGORA COMPETE TO ISSUE HYPERLIQUID'S USDH STABLECOIN (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Hyperliquid is preparing to launch USDH, a Hyperliquid-native
stablecoin, with issuers competing for the contract through validator
vote. Paxos proposed a MiCA- and GENIUS-compliant USDH with HYPE
buybacks and zero-fee conversion from USDC, Frax offered a
“community-first” model that forwards 100% of Treasury yields to
users via frxUSD, and Agora pledged 100% net revenue share backed by
State Street and VanEck reserves. A fourth team, Native Markets, also
submitted a bid using Stripe-owned Bridge, while Ethena hinted it may
join the race. Validator voting will determine the issuer on September
14.
