MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN DIPS BELOW $80,000, DRAGGING CRYPTO MARKET DOWNWARD (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Due to macroeconomic conditions caused by President Trump's tariff
announcements, Bitcoin dropped below $78,000 Sunday night. Numerous
other cryptocurrencies had similar declines, with Ethereum and Solana
down nearly 13%. 

 WHY STABLECOINS ARE A TOP BET FOR CRYPTO VCS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 VC firms are increasingly investing in stablecoin projects,
recognizing them as a leading application of blockchain technology.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BITCOIN DEVELOPER PROPOSES HARD FORK TO PROTECT BTC FROM QUANTUM
COMPUTING THREATS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Agustin Cruz has introduced a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal called the
Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol (QRAMP) to shift Bitcoin
wallets from their current signature type (ECDSA) to post-quantum
cryptography. The plan enforces a migration deadline where
non-upgraded nodes would reject legacy transactions, aiming to preempt
potential vulnerabilities from emerging quantum computing power. The
emerging threat of quantum computing has sparked debate over Bitcoin's
long-term stability and mitigation efforts.

seamless integration with existing infrastructure via upcoming SDKs
and a docs portal.

 FIVE NEW DEFI TRENDS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 DeFi is evolving fast. Five major trends are shaping its future:
real-world asset tokenization, undercollateralized lending,
Bitcoin-based DeFi, smarter frontends, and the rise of stablecoins
with better payment infrastructure. These innovations aim to expand
DeFi's reach, improve usability, and unlock new financial
opportunities across the ecosystem. 

 PHAVER GOES BANKRUPT (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Phaver, once a promising social app with strong traction in the Lens
and Farcaster ecosystems, went bankrupt because of a poorly executed
token launch, overspending on CEX listings, and a failure to secure
operational funding. Despite raising $8M, the team mismanaged key
aspects like token vesting and cash flow, ultimately leading to its
collapse.

 WHY PROJECTS WITH NO PRODUCT RAISE MORE MONEY: A SIMPLE GAME THEORY
EXPLANATION (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Crypto projects without products often raise more money because they
allow investors to imagine unlimited potential, unrestricted by
real-world limitations or disappointing metrics. 

 COW PROTOCOL INVESTIGATES SURPLUS SHIFTING (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 CoW Protocol recently identified an issue where a solver's actions
led to a trader receiving a worse-than-expected price on CoW Swap,

situation known as "surplus shifting."
