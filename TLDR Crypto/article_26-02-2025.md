GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 DID LIQUIDITY IN CRYPTO JUST DRY UP? (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Bybit hack on February 21, declared the "largest financial heist
in history" by Arkham Intelligence, has significantly dampened crypto
market sentiment, surpassing previous major hacks like PolyNetwork's
$611M theft. Combined with reduced risk appetite, technical pullbacks,
and broader market volatility, these factors have led to decreased
liquidity and pressure on crypto markets, though such pullbacks are
not uncommon in bull runs. 

 KEEP YOUR CRYPTO #SAFU, CZ'S TIPS (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Crypto security requires balancing convenience and safety, whether
storing funds yourself or using centralized exchanges. For
self-storage, prioritize preventing theft and loss and ensuring
inheritance plans, using offline devices, encrypted backups, and tools
like PGP for secure transfers. For exchanges, opt for reputable
platforms like Binance, enable 2FA, U2F, and withdrawal whitelists,
and maintain strong email and device security to mitigate risks.
Combining both methods ensures flexibility and robust protection for
your crypto assets.

 THE PRODUCTIVE CRYPTOECONOMY - A THESIS FOR ADOPTION (3 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 For the cryptoeconomy to transition from speculation to substantive
impact, it must integrate productive assets including Real-World
Assets, DePIN, and agent collectives into its financial systems.
Challenges to this transition include privacy, identity verification,
compliance frameworks, wallet recovery, and security measures â€“ all
of which need resolution for mainstream adoption. Near-term
developments like regulated ICOs, large-scale asset tokenization, and
stablecoin adoption will occur and accelerate this vision. 

 WHY MEGAETH WILL TURN THE L2 EXPERIENCE UPSIDE DOWN (4 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 MegaETH, an upcoming Ethereum L2, claims to achieve unprecedented
performance with 100,000 TPS and 10-millisecond blockchains through a
specialized node architecture that separates sequencing, proving, and
validation roles. It differentiates itself from other L2s with high
hardware requirements for sequencer nodes while maintaining
decentralization through lighter replica nodes. The platform has
conducted two community-focused token distribution events, with a
public testnet launch expected in the coming weeks.
