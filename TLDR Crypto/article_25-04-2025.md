MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TON NAMES MOONPAY CO-FOUNDER CEO (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The TON Foundation has appointed MoonPay co-founder Maximilian Crown
as its new CEO, aiming to increase growth following a plateau in user
adoption and ecosystem activity. Crown's leadership is expected to
bring fresh strategic direction to TON, which has seen limited
momentum despite its integration with Telegram and previous efforts to
expand its blockchain ecosystem. 

 CITIGROUP: STABLECOIN SUPPLY COULD HIT $3.7 TRILLION BY 2030 (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Citigroup projects that the stablecoin market could expand to nearly
$4 trillion by 2030. This will be largely driven by the increasing use
of stablecoins in payments, cash management, and as a hedge against
local currencies. ~90% of stablecoins will remain U.S.
dollar-denominated. Banks can potentially stay relevant by offering
services like custody, reserve asset brokerage, and issuing their own
stablecoins.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING SNAIL: VERIFIABLE COMPUTATION NEAR-NATIVE SPEEDS (70
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SNAIL introduces a new zero knowledge circuit that improves prover
runtime to be within 30% of native execution. It is a new way to prove
that complex computations (like executing a blockchain block) were
done correctly without redoing the work. Instead of doing lots of
cryptographic tricks, like FFT transforms and using big Merkle trees,
SNAIL streams a program's data once and uses a novel “difference
check” to compress everything into a single proof. Live, on-the-fly
proofs are now practical, enabling Ethereum blocks to be proved in
30ms and verified on a smartphone in 1ms. 

 INTRODUCING HALO AND HUSD (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Halo is launching HUSD to be a digital dollar for the Hyperliquid
chain and DEX. It aims to replace bridged USDC to eliminate
cross-chain and issuer risks. Backed by treasury assets with daily
attestations and ISIN-level visibility, HUSD offers native liquidity
and yield capture for the ecosystem. Unlike existing stablecoins, Halo
will distribute most trading and collateral income back to liquidity
providers, builders, and HYPE stakers.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 COMBINED METRICS FOR TRACKING SMART CONTRACT NETWORKS (28 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Key blockchain indicators, including TVL, fees, stablecoin market
cap, DEX volume, and net bridge flows, should be distilled into
“size” and “growth” scores that simplify cross-network
comparisons. Using 30-day averages and normalized market-share
conditions for “size” alongside week-on-week min-max and Z-score
aggregations for “growth” surfaces major shifts without requiring
deep dives into raw data. Applied to L1s and L2s, the metrics show a
modest decline in the top three networks' (Ethereum, Solana, and Base)
combined market share and highlight volatility driven by bridge flows
and token performance. 

 DESCI, AI, AND THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE VALUE CHAIN (19 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Decentralized Science (DeSci) tackles pain points across collection,
transformation, storage, and computation by embedding cryptoeconomic
incentives and blockchain-based verifiability to guarantee data
ownership, privacy, and quality. It positions data collection as the
key piece to coordinating high-quality contributions at scale and is
enabled by Web3 wearables, DataDAOs, and cryptographically secure lab
hardware. DeSci aims to overcome fragmentation, bias, and trust issues
that plague traditional AI academia by tokenizing participation and
anchoring provenance onchain.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LET' S TALK ABOUT PLASMA (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Plasma is an EVM-compatible L1 incubated by Bitfinex/Tether. It
anchors its state of Bitcoin and uses custom PlasmaBFT consensus to
offer compliant, shielded, and zero-fee USDT settlements. Plasma aims
to build a “T-chain” ecosystem focused on payments, PayFi, and
fintech rails rather than speculative trading. Its goal is to capture
stablecoin volume and foster long-term USDT adoption. 

 SCALING BASE: REACHING 50 MGAS/S IN Q2 (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Base scaled to 25 Mgas/s in Q1 and is on track to hit 50 Mgas/s by
end-of-Q2 on its way to a 250 Mgas/s annual target. Key bottlenecks
include L1 data availability, execution client speed, fault-proof
performance, and state/history growth. A rigorous go/no-go process,
proactive benchmarking against future gas limits, and published node
configuration guidance ensure safety and reliability as Base raises
its gas target.

 METAMASK ALLOWS USERS TO SELECT GAS TOKEN (1 MINUTE READ) [14]
