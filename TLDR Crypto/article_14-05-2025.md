INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE UPDATES MASS PAYOUTS DEMO (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Coinbase has updated its Mass Payouts demo app to showcase the
capabilities of CDP Wallets v2. The tool enables developers to send
crypto payments to thousands of addresses seamlessly, with no wallet
key management required. The upgraded version supports high throughput
and CSV-based batch transactions for fast, scalable payouts. 

 CRYPTO AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS (30 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blockchain presents a fundamentally improved architecture for capital
markets by replacing today's opaque, rent-extracting systems with
transparent, trustless frameworks. Tracing the transition from the
1970s paperwork crisis to the DTCC-dominated clearing model, the
authors of this paper argue that policy decisions entrenched
intermediaries that blockchain technology now seeks to
disintermediate. They advocate for regulation that prioritizes
transparency, programmability, and peer-to-peer ownership as tokenized
securities evolve.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO STAY SAFE FROM WALLET DRAINERS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethereum's recent EIP-7702 upgrade introduced batched transaction
functionality, enabling multiple approvals or transfers in a single
signed message. This feature allows wallet drainers to steal all
assets (ETH, tokens, and NFTs) in one click. While rumors suggest that
merely upgrading a wallet can result in asset loss, such claims are
largely FUD. Mainstream wallets like MetaMask only upgrade to their
own smart contracts. Nonetheless, signing malicious transactions,
especially on phishing sites, remains riskier than ever. 

 GEORGIOS KONSTANTOPOULOS: ACCELERATION IS THE NEW NORMAL (13 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Crypto must adapt to an era where execution speed, not just
innovation, is the core differentiator. Competing directly with AI and
TradFi on performance, user experience, and talent, the ecosystem
faces centralization risks as projects prioritize speed. Developers
should build fast, open systems with transparent infrastructure,
sub-second confirmations, and verifiable markets while preserving
crypto-native principles like self-custody, composability, and
censorship resistance.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PORT CITY PROTOCOLS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ethereum's “Port City Protocols” paradigm transforms simple swap
stalls into structured trading hubs with controlled entry,
tariff-style fees, and onchain warehousing of multiple assets within
single contracts. By embedding protocol rules and asset management
into one contract, these designs cut external calls and slash gas
costs while offering clearer security and governance. Early examples
like Uniswap V4 and ZAMM demonstrate how such systems can evolve into
robust, organized “port cities.” EIP-7907's adoption is expected
to spark a wave of similar scalable and efficient protocol designs. 

 A BRIEF HISTORY OF TOKEN LAUNCHES (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Token launch strategies have evolved from Bitcoin's proof-of-work
distribution through ICOs and IEOs to DeFi-era mechanisms like
airdrops and yield farming. Innovations such as IDOs and
liquidity-bootstrapping pools enabled permissionless market entry,
while platforms like Pump.fun and DAOs.fun broadened access to
issuance. Emerging tools from Zora and Believe now fuse social media
dynamics with token creation. Doppler Protocol leads the next phase
with dynamic auctions, multicurve pricing, and automated liquidity
migration for secure, compliant token launches.
