 ZKASINO $33 MILLION REDIRECTED TO LIDO (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The launch of ZKasino, a decentralized gambling network, has sparked
outrage among investors after the developers unexpectedly changed
plans, preventing users from redeeming their bridged ether and instead
automatically vesting it into $ZKAS tokens over a 15-month period.
Despite warning signs and allegations of mismanagement, the project
had initially attracted over $33 million from 10,000 participants.
Following the controversial launch, the funds were sent to staking
platform Lido, leading to widespread accusations of a rug pull and the
cancellation of ZKasino's IDO and exchange listing.

LOWEST AMONG SPOT BITCOIN ETFS (2 MINUTE READ) [5]

migrate to the lower-fee product. The Bitcoin Mini Trust will trade
under the BTC ticker.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT WE CAN EXPECT POST-HALVING (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 We've seen a dramatic increase in Bitcoin prices after each halving,
compounded by narratives like ICOs in 2016 and NFTs in 2020. With this
halving, the two main narratives are ETFs and institutional adoption
and the rise of the BTC L2/DeFi ecosystem. The Bitcoin ETFs are
already half the size of gold ETFs, with $43 billion in combined
assets, and there has never been more institutional interest. At the
same time, Ordinals, Runes, and Bitcoin L2s are driving higher
transaction fees and reinvigorating the Bitcoin development ecosystem.

 THE L2 ENDGAME ISN'T FEE REVENUE (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 L2s like Base are making millions of dollars daily on sequencer fee
revenue. However, competition for blockspace is not the end goal.
Instead, it is to make blockspace as cheap, reliable, and desirable as
possible to incentivize applications to build on the platform. Over
time, this will lead to network effects and massive liquidity
advantages for the winning L2s. 

 BLACKROCK'S CRYPTO STRATEGY (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 BlackRock categorizes digital assets into cryptoassets, stablecoins,
and tokenized assets. As the owner of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, an
investor in Circle, and the BUIDL money market fund creator, it is
exposed to each group. BlackRock believes in Bitcoin for its
internet-native accessibility, cross-border transactional efficiency,
and sound inflation schedule. Blockchain can create nonstop capital
markets with greater efficiency and transparency.
