MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN FACES 20-MONTH LOW IN VOLATILITY AND MONTHLY TRANSACTIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin's implied volatility and monthly transactions have dropped to
their lowest levels since October 2023, signaling a cooldown in
onchain activity. June saw a 15% decline in transactions
month-over-month, with miners picking up low-fee transactions buried
in the mempool. Despite the lull, demand from U.S. spot ETFs has
surged, with cumulative net inflows nearing $50 billion and holdings
topping $137.6 billion. Public companies also added 65,000 BTC in
June, underscoring a shift toward institutional dominance amid retail
apathy. 

 ETHEREUM IS POWERING WALL STREET'S FUTURE (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 EthCC in Cannes highlighted Ethereum's transition into institutional
finance rails, with firms like BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, Coinbase,
Kraken, and Robinhood announcing tokenization and trading
infrastructure built on Ethereum and its Layer 2 solutions. Robinhood
became the first public US company to offer tokenized stocks via
Arbitrum, while Deutsche Bank unveiled plans for a zkSync-based
tokenization platform, and Coinbase and Kraken filed with regulators
for onchain equities offerings. ETH gained nearly 6% on the week as
companies like BitMine and Bit Digital shifted treasury reserves into
ETH, and ether ETFs recorded back-to-back inflows, underpinned by
stablecoin settlement dominance on Ethereum. Ethereum's decade-long
uptime, security, and neutrality are now its core selling points for
institutions seeking programmable, reliable finance infrastructure.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AGENT COMMERCE PROTOCOL BUILDER'S GUIDE UNVEILED (15 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Virtuals' ACP Builder's Guide is a technical playbook for developers
integrating with the Agent Commerce Protocol. Featuring SDK and plugin
links, onboarding resources, integration steps, known issues with
fixes, sample use cases, and release notes, it walks teams through
agent registration on the Service Registry, smart wallet creation and
whitelisting, and detailed ACP job lifecycle and prompting best
practices. The guide distinguishes between sandbox and graduated agent
environments, explains SLA configuration and status indicators, and
provides tips for agent profiling, service definition, and governance.
Built from early adopter insights, it equips developers to deploy,
test, and iterate fully onchain agent commerce applications. 

 LIDO DUAL GOVERNANCE LIVE ON MAINNET (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Lido DAO launched a dual governance system that grants stETH holders
veto rights over protocol decisions. Holders representing at least 1%
of total staked ETH can delay proposals for five days by staking stETH
into an escrow contract. If dissent reaches 10% of staked ETH, the DAO
enters “rage-quit” mode, freezing new proposals until conflicts
are resolved. This design introduces an onchain check-and-balance to
safeguard liquid stakers against potentially adverse governance
actions.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 PREPARING FOR MASS ADOPTION | STABLECOIN CHAPTER 2 (10 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The GENIUS Act has catalyzed a new wave of global stablecoin adoption
by turning regulatory clarity into a tailwind. Major players like
Stripe, PayPal, and Walmart are building on compliant infrastructure,
while Fireblocks reports that 86% of firms already have stablecoin
systems in place. Stablecoins are now powering payments, onchain FX,
RWA strategies, and yield markets, with protocols like Cap, Gauntlet,
and Perena aggregating fragmented DeFi opportunities. With 99%+ of
onchain FX volume in USD stables and compliance tools maturing fast,
stablecoins are evolving into programmable financial infrastructure
for the mainstream. 

 BET SIZING (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Effective bet sizing balances maximizing gains when a thesis is
correct and minimizing losses when it isn't, making it one of the most
impactful skills in trading. Stanley Druckenmiller's 1992 decision to
double Quantum Fund's entire position against the pound at George
Soros's urging exemplifies conviction in asymmetric opportunities.
Clear entry triggers and decisive sizing can yield outsized returns.
Consistent risk management, with predefined invalidation points and
strict cut-loss rules, is essential to prevent catastrophic drawdowns
and preserve capital for future high-conviction trades.

 CELESTIA DRAWS DISPROPORTIONATE CRITICISM AMID VC SELLOFF (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Celestia is being unfairly scapegoated despite sharing the same -90%
chart, tokenomics, and VC dumping behavior as countless other
projects. Polychain's aggressive selling has crushed the price, yet
the backlash is harsher due to outsized early hype, slow adoption, and
underwater airdrop participants. Celestia's core tech remains a rare
“zero to one” innovation that's more robust now than when TIA
traded at $20. 

 WHEN HEDGE FUNDS BET ON SPORTS: THE RISE OF INSTITUTIONAL WAGERING (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 DKING has secured $300 million from a top sports-betting hedge fund
to deploy via its autonomous Meta-Model, which dynamically trades
global football markets using real-time data and institutional risk
frameworks. Profits flow back into $DKING buybacks, aligning hedge
fund alpha with protocol growth. As sports betting evolves into an
institutional asset class, DKING is building the on-chain
infrastructure to make that edge accessible to everyone.
