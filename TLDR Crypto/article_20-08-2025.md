 FED'S BOWMAN CALLS FOR EMBRACING CRYPTO AND TECH (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said the U.S. is at a
“crossroads” and must embrace crypto and new technologies to stay
ahead in financial innovation. She urged regulators to abandon an
“overly cautious mindset,” noting the Fed has already scrapped its
crypto bank supervision program and eased restrictions on stablecoin
activities. Bowman added that Fed staff should hold small amounts of
crypto to better understand the technology, comparing it to learning
to ski by actually putting on skis. 

 BITCOIN SLIPS TO $113K, ETH AT $4,100 AHEAD OF JACKSON HOLE (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin fell 2.8% to ~$113K and ETH dropped 5.4% to ~$4.1K as traders
took profits and repositioned ahead of Fed Chair Powell's Jackson Hole
speech. BTC faces pressure from liquidations, while ETH's $4,200 level
is a key pivot that could determine whether flows shift toward $3,900.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 CIRCLE GATEWAY LIVE ON MAINNET (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Circle Gateway has launched on mainnet, offering a unified USDC
balance that provides instant crosschain liquidity access in under 500
milliseconds across seven supported chains, including Arbitrum,
Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, OP Mainnet, Polygon PoS, and Unichain. The
platform combines smart contract infrastructure with an offchain
attestation service to solve fragmented liquidity issues that force
businesses to pre-position USDC across multiple chains, improving
capital efficiency for payment service providers, exchanges,
custodians, and wallets. Gateway operates on non-custodial principles
where users retain control of their funds while enabling next-block
speed transfers through user signatures combined with Gateway
attestations. The solution targets businesses building at scale who
need fast, capital-efficient settlement across chains without the
operational overhead of managing chain-specific balances and
rebalancing processes. 

 BULLISH IPO RAISES $1.15B IN STABLECOINS, A FIRST FOR PUBLIC MARKETS
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bullish became the first U.S.-listed company to raise over half its
IPO proceeds in stablecoins, securing $1.15B across eight stablecoins,
mostly minted on Solana and custodied by Coinbase. The move transforms
IPO settlement from single-currency, T+2 processes to instant,
multi-currency rails with liquidity provided by major issuers like
Circle, Paxos, and SocGen. By proving stablecoin-based settlement at
scale, Bullish signals how public equity markets may adopt crypto
infrastructure for capital raising.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BANKR THESIS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 DeFAI (Decentralized Finance AI) will be the breakout category of
2025, addressing crypto's decade-long user experience problem where
wallets remain difficult and intimidating for newcomers. The thesis
centers on AI-powered crypto interfaces that allow users to execute
complex operations through simple text commands like "swap my XRP for
LINK" or "bridge my SOL to ETH," eliminating the need for step-by-step
tutorials and dangerous seed phrase management. An example of this
"net-new" application category is bankrbot, which completely
reimagines crypto interaction at its core, making it accessible and
safe for mainstream adoption. The investment case rests on DeFAI
representing the first truly innovative crypto use case since previous
cycles' DeFi, NFTs, and gaming narratives, with AI serving as the
"ultimate frontend" that crypto has desperately needed. 

 WHY THIS BULL MARKET STILL HAS LEGS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The current bull market is driven by AI-generated liquidity rather
than traditional Fed policy, with hyperscaler equity gains and capex
cascading through the economy while crypto treasury companies create a
reflexive loop converting equity euphoria into onchain demand. Key
structural changes include ETH ETFs recording over $1 billion in
single-day inflows and companies like BitMine expanding treasury
strategies to $24.5 billion, creating persistent institutional buyers
that previous cycles lacked. Despite macro headwinds, including sticky
inflation from tariffs, labor market softening, and policy
uncertainty, the analysis remains valid as long as the "AI → Retail
→ Treasury Company → Spot" transmission mechanism stays intact.
This cycle can continue until either hyperscaler capex rolls over or
ETF demand stalls, making it fundamentally different from the
Fed-driven liquidity cycles of 2021.

 ON TOKENIZATION (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A prominent crypto influencer explains their evolution from being
anti-tokenization to embracing it with strict principles, arguing that
the key difference between legitimate and scammy tokenization lies in
transparency and the social contract rather than the act of putting
things onchain itself. Clear communication about holdings, promises,
and intentions, and maintaining credibility through transparent
practices actually enhanced their reputation while allowing them to
benefit from tokenized services. They highlight a new wave of
tokenization focused on actual services like access, time, and
information rather than pure speculation, comparing it to legitimate
business models like selling online courses. The core philosophy
presented is that onchain deployment is neither inherently good nor
bad, but success depends on responsible promotion, clear expectations,
and delivering genuine value rather than making grandiose promises or
engaging in pump-and-dump schemes. 

 SHARPLINK HIGHLIGHTS ETH CONCENTRATION METRIC FOR SHAREHOLDERS (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 SharpLink's core mission is to accumulate ETH and grow shareholder
value by tracking “ETH Concentration,” a metric showing how much
Ethereum backs every 1,000 fully diluted SBET shares. Since launch,
ETH Concentration has risen 94% from 2.00 to 3.87, meaning each share
now represents more ETH despite dilution.
