MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC PREPARES TO SUE UNISWAP (1 MINUTE READ) [3] 

 Uniswap Labs received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange
Commission warning the company that the regulator intends to pursue
legal action. The company argues that tokens are not securities and
that most tokens traded on the protocol are not investment contracts.
Recently, there have been discussions about turning on the fee switch
for the UNI token. However, this has not been implemented, and Uniswap
Labs insists that UNI does not fit the definition of a security since
there is no investment contract between the company and token holders.


 BITCOIN PRICE DROPS BELOW $69K AHEAD OF INFLATION READING (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The price of Bitcoin has dropped below $69,000 as investors wait for
U.S. Consumer Price Index data that could influence the Fed's decision
on interest rates. Although the market is divided on the possibility
of a June rate cut, strong employment data suggests the Fed may
maintain current rates, even as inflation is expected to show an
increase.

 ORA PROTOCOLâ€™S FIRST INITIAL MODEL OFFERING (IMO) (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Ora Protocolâ€™s IMO allows tokenizing AI models onchain, bringing
revenue sharing to IMO token holders. IMOs serve three purposes:
enabling sustainable open-source AI funding, aligning contribution
incentives, and model value capture for holders. The $OLM IMO will
tokenize the OpenLM model, a medium-sized language model that is
performant on up to 7 billion parameters. 

 PRIVY LAUNCHES ONBOARDING WITH PASSKEYS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Privy is introducing passkey-based login for users, which combines
the security of biometric authentication with an enhanced user
experience. The company recognizes the current limitations of
passkeys, such as cross-device usability and partial browser support,
and claims to have developed solutions to solve some of these
roadblocks.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW LIQUID ARE LIQUID RESTAKING TOKENS? (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Liquid restaking tokens comprise 73% of EigenLayer deposits and are
the next evolution of liquid staking protocols like Lido or Jito. With
a 7-day withdrawal period on EigenLayer, the barrier to exit is high,
making liquidity and price pegging to ETH critical to the success of
LRTs. This article analyzes the liquidity, volatility, and volume of
the top 5 LRTS â€“ Ether.fi, Renzo, Puffer, Swell, and Kelp DAO â€“
finding that they are not incredibly liquid but have been slowly
improving. The LRT market has winner-take-most characteristics since
liquidity and integrations are critical to an LRTâ€™s broader success.


 SOME MUSINGS ON RESTAKING PROTOCOLS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Though EigenLayer is the clear market leader in the restaking space,
other ecosystems may introduce similar protocols that use SOL or TIA
as collateral. As the first asset-agnostic platform, Karak may see a
first-mover advantage, especially since it accepts stablecoins. At the
same time, single-ecosystem protocols like Lido or Jito have
historically performed better, and partnerships with liquid staking
and DeFi protocols will prove critical in gaining adoption and
integrations.

 COMMODITISING YOUR COMPLEMENTS WITH MODULAR ARCHITECTURE (17 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The commoditization of blockchain infrastructure, enabled by more
competitors and options in the modular stack, is catalyzing a new wave
of customized, application-specific rollups. By leveraging components
like data availability layers (Celestia, Avail, and EigenDA), rollup
SDKs (Sovereign and RollKit), and shared sequencers (Astria and
Espresso), developers can focus on optimizing applications without the
burden of managing the entire stack. At the same time, infrastructure
providers can increase demand for their products and protocols by
decreasing the cost of using them by commoditizing the complements or
tools an application relies on. 

 BLUR GOT THE FEEDBACK LOOP WRONG (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 By incentivizing users to stay liquid and continuously bid, NFT
marketplace Blur may have had the lowest floors, but at the cost of
incrementally devaluing NFTs on its platform. Activity on the
marketplace, which rewards users with BLUR tokens, was an effective
strategy to capture market share and volume in the short term, but it
was not strong enough to keep competitor Magic Eden from doubling its
daily trading volume and becoming the leading NFT marketplace by
revenue. Part of this is due to Magic Edenâ€™s adoption of Bitcoin
Ordinals instead of Blurâ€™s focus on Ethereum mainnet.
