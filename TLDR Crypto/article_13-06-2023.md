BINANCE.US RESPONDS TO FRAUD, MARKET MANIPULATION, ASSET SAFEGUARDING
CLAIMS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theblock.co/post/234323/binanceus-responds-to-fraud-market-manipulation-asset-safeguarding-claims?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

Binance.US is fighting back against allegations of fraud, market
manipulation, and customer deception made by the SEC. It insists it
has been fully cooperating with the investigation since December 2020.
The SEC claims Binance.US, along with parent company Binance, funneled
over $12 billion in customer assets to funds controlled by founder CZ.
In its defense, Binance.US states that it keeps customer and corporate
funds separate. This dispute occurs ahead of a hearing on an
SEC-requested temporary restraining order, which would freeze all
assets of Binance.US besides customer withdrawals. 

US CONGRESSMAN FILES LEGISLATION TO FIRE SEC CHAIR GARY GENSLER (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://watcher.guru/news/us-congressman-files-legislation-to-fire-sec-chair-gary-gensler?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

Congressman Warren Davidson has proposed legislation aiming to
restructure the SEC and dismiss its chair, Gary Gensler, citing his
"tyrannical" leadership. This follows recent enforcement actions taken
by the SEC against leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase and
Binance, for alleged securities law violations. Davidson's move
reflects growing concerns amongst crypto users and politicians about
the potentially negative impact of the SEC's actions on the digital
asset sector and broader US capital markets.

ORC-20 > BRC-20? (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1668264961590607882.html]

The ORC-20 token standard, created by OrcDAO, is aiming to improve
scalability issues that could hinder the BRC-20 standard by reducing
transaction costs. ORC-20's operations or capabilities include
Deploying, Minting, Sending, and Canceling, and it allows changes to a
token‚Äôs properties, multi-recipient sending, and cancellation of
partial transactions. It also features Orc Improvement Proposals
(OIPs), aimed at further enhancing efficiency and functionality. While
ORC-20 brings more features, BRC-20 already benefits from strong
network effects, so it is tough to say which one will ultimately
prevail as the standard.

[https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-2-0-the-value-layer-of-the-internet?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

ZK-powered L2 chains, offering a seamless experience across numerous
chains. The vision for Polygon 2.0 will be gradually revealed in
future updates, some of which are on the roadmap in the article

BRIDGES IN THE MULTI-CHAIN OF MADNESS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1668302660603195394.html]

As the crypto ecosystem becomes more multi-chain, the total volume of
bridged transactions is growing. This has been led by Stargate, which
has facilitated 42.9% of the volume and dominates in users and
transactions. Despite lower average transaction values, Stargate is
the preferred choice for average users due to its low-fee structure.
This Twitter thread explains how several blockchain bridging solutions
are addressing the issue of isolated liquidity across different
networks. The thread also compares some of the other bridging
solutions with Stargate, breaking them down by volume, transactions,
users, and fees (revenue).

A NEW CRYPTO BANKING SYSTEM ARISES UNDER THE SHADOW OF A REGULATORY
CRACKDOWN (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/EIaU3?utm_source=tldr_crypto]

Following the collapse of Silvergate Capital Corp. and Signature Bank,
crypto firms are turning to smaller, regional lenders and Swiss and
Asian banks for services. This comes as increased scrutiny and
regulatory crackdowns in the US have led mainstream banks to be
cautious about crypto causing the banking situation for crypto firms
in the US to be worse than the pre-2018 era. It has led to the
development of a new banking system for crypto, which is
fragmented/decentralized, less US-focused, and less publicized. While
this may be a challenge for the industry, it could lead to a more
resilient system.

ongoing monetary policy adjustments, particularly rising interest
rates.
