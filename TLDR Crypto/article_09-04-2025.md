 RIPPLE TO ACQUIRE PRIME BROKER HIDDEN ROAD FOR $1.25B (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Ripple is buying prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion,

and the XRP Ledger into Hidden Road's infrastructure, positioning
Ripple to better bridge traditional finance and digital assets. 

 DOJ AXES CRYPTO UNIT AS TRUMP'S REGULATORY PULLBACK CONTINUES (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The DOJ has disbanded its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team
and shifted its focus from enforcing regulatory violations to
targeting criminal activities like fraud and terrorist financing. The
US Deputy Attorney General emphasized that the department is not a
regulator. This is a clear deviation from the previous “regulation
by prosecution” approach, which was halted by President Trump's
executive order on digital assets.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 DEMYSTIFYING "TVL DEALS" (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 TVL deals are a way for crypto projects to temporarily boost their
total value locked by offering a small portion of tokens in exchange
for liquidity - a tactic aimed at building trust and early momentum.
Deal parameters like asset type, lock-up duration, and transparent
documentation are critical for incentive alignment and ensuring
liquidity remains sticky. These deals have come under criticism for
artificially inflating metrics and obscuring details from retail
users. 

 TYPE III STABLECOINS (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Type III stablecoins replace human oversight with immutable smart
contracts. Unlike traditional models, which either depend on a
centralized team (Type I) or decentralized committees (Type II) to
allocate capital, Type III protocols, like Cap, use shared security
and market-driven dynamics to match operator strategies weighted by
restaker votes. This model lowers switching latency when market
conditions change and ensures yield generation and risk management are
aligned with user interests.

 THE COLOR OF MONEY (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article compares the business models of major stablecoins -
USDT, USDC, and USDS - through the lens of reserve structure and
return on equity. It highlights how full reserve models (like USDC)
prioritize liquidity but face profitability challenges, while
fractional reserve models (like Tether and Sky) take on more risk for
higher returns, suggesting a future where stablecoins serve different
roles based on their economic design.
