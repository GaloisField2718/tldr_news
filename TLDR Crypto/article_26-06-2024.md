 BITWISE CIO PREDICTS SPOT ETHEREUM ETFS WILL ATTRACT $15 BILLION OF
NET INFLOWS IN 18 MONTHS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, predicts Ethereum ETFs will see $15
billion in net inflows in their first 18 months of trading. In a note
sent to clients, he cited ETH/BTC market cap comparisons,

 EXECUTION AUCTIONS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO EXECUTION TICKETS (15 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Researchers Jonah Burian and Davide Crapis discuss two mechanisms,
Execution Auctions (EAs) and Execution Tickets (ETs), to address

protection against centralization, but each approach has unique
trade-offs and implementation challenges.

 ARBITRUM DAO STAKING PROPOSAL (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Arbitrum's recent staking proposal offers 50% of surplus sequencer
fees to ARB stakers, which equates to a 7% APY. The goal is to make
the DAO more resilient to vote manipulation or hostile takeovers since
only 10% of ARB is actively used in governance. It will use Tally to
make liquid-staked ARB. 

 THE CRYPTO CASINO (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The "crypto casino" has chips with a floating exchange rate, where
the value is dependent on user demand and desire to profit.
User-driven rallies have very little to do with the technology and are
negative sum for retail investors. For the market to succeed, it must
develop beyond speculation and gambling.
