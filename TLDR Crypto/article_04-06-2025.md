MARKETS & BUSINESS

 PUMP.FUN PLANS $1B TOKEN SALE AT $4B VALUATION (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pump.fun is preparing a $1 billion token sale at a $4 billion
valuation, with tokens offered to both public and private investors
and a launch teased within the next two weeks. The Solana-based
memecoin launchpad has generated over $700 million in cumulative
revenue and enabled nearly 11 million tokens with a total market
capitalization of about $4.5 billion. In response to rising
competition, Pump.fun recently introduced its own AMM, ending an
unofficial partnership with Raydium, and rolled out a mobile app
alongside a reinstated live-streaming feature. 

 US MILITARY LEADERSHIP TO BACK BITCOIN STRATEGIC RESERVE (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Senator Lummis stated that U.S. military leaders, particularly
generals stationed in Southeast Asia, support creating a national
Bitcoin reserve as a strategic hedge amid economic tensions with
China. She argued that holding BTC would strengthen the U.S. in both
economic and military conflicts, noting the administration's broader
“economic war” narrative. Lummis' remarks align with Trump's push
to make the U.S. a crypto leader and contrast with China's
comprehensive crypto ban despite its own digital Yuan development.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ETHEREUM FOUNDATION: ANNOUNCING PROTOCOL (17 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ethereum Foundation's Protocol R&D group has rebranded to
“Protocol” and reorganized around three strategic goals –
scaling L1, scaling blobs (L2), and improving UX – to accelerate
development in light of rapid zkEVM and L2 advances. Leadership has
been explicitly assigned for each initiative: Tim Beiko and Ansgar
Dietrichs on L1 scaling, Alex Stokes and Francesco D'Amato on L2
scaling, and Barnabé Monnot and Josh Rudolf on UX, with Dankrad Feist
advising across tracks. The restructure streamlines teams and
coordination structures to ensure research transitions quickly into
production, while former PR&D members are moving on to other roles
within the ecosystem. 

 INFINIFI: AMPLIFIED YIELD (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 InfiniFi introduces an onchain fractional reserve banking model that
allocates a portion of “liquid” stablecoin deposits into
higher‑yield “illiquid” farms to boost returns for both liquid
and locked depositors without adding new protocol risk. Users choose
between staking ($siUSD) for instant access or locking ($liUSD‑xw)
for higher illiquid yields. InfiniFi then intelligently leverages part
of the liquid pool into long‑duration strategies, amplifying overall
yield. The only liquidity risk arises if liquid depositors withdraw en
masse, but this pressure diminishes as total value locked grows,
mirroring traditional banking resilience.

 STABLECON TAKEAWAYS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There was a surprising lack of understanding around USDT's historical
importance in U.S. crypto circles at the Stablecon conference. Western
markets are primarily driven by stablecoin programmability while
emerging markets value their permissionless nature. The real profit
opportunity lies in FX orchestration layers, which will need massive
transaction volumes to achieve scale. Stablecoin user experiences
differ greatly between U.S. savers/spenders and users in other
regions. Tether's continued dominance is attributed to its strong user
and liquidity network effects, while local stablecoins will require
integration into a global USDT liquidity pool to succeed. 

 CIRCLE IPO - TIME FOR STABLECOIN SUMMER? (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Circle is set to IPO on June 5 under the ticker CRCL, aiming to
raise $624 million at a $6.7 billion valuation. Cathie Wood's ARK
is committing $150 million and BlackRock's Larry Fink $60 million,
about 35% of the total raise, and the deal is reportedly
oversubscribed. As a traditional IPO with a 180‑day lockup, CRCL
could trade above its $6.7 billion launch valuation, offering one of
the only liquid ways to bet on stablecoin growth and blockchain's
expansion amid a forthcoming GENIUS Act. How CRCL performs may set
relative valuation benchmarks for DeFi projects, making issuers with
stablecoin exposure appear more attractive and potentially catalyzing
a “Stablecoin Summer” by lifting valuation ceilings.

MISCELLANEOUS

 INFOFI'S COBRA EFFECT (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 InfoFi's promise to tokenize and democratize off-chain data has
backfired, turning platforms like Crypto Twitter into spam factories
where bots and airdrop hunters flood sentiment and mindshare metrics.
Efforts to tokenize social capital, ranging from token-gated content
and social tokens to onchain social graphs, have incentivized
engagement over accuracy, worsening information quality. This “cobra
effect” traps InfoFi in a narrow loop of repetitive, copy‑paste
solutions that fail to address real needs and generate continual hype
cycles. Genuine progress requires sourcing data outside of
engagement-driven social consensus rather than building more
coordination layers atop a flawed foundation. 

 ETHEREUM THESIS – ROOT CHAIN FOR THE WORLD COMPUTER (50 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Ethereum evolved into the leading smart contract platform by
prioritizing security and decentralization, which enabled it to
capture DeFi's product-market fit and accrue value via fee burns.
Faced with scalability constraints, Ethereum embraced a
rollup‑centric roadmap, offloading execution to Layer 2s and
expanding data availability to keep transaction costs low while
onboarding high‑velocity use cases. The main challenge today is
ensuring rollup interoperability and restoring strong network effects
like trust and liquidity by positioning Ethereum as the unifying
settlement and DA layer for all rollups. Long term, Ethereum's
strategy is to scale L1 throughput, solve cross‑rollup interactions,
and gradually introduce minimal blob pricing to capture massive fee
revenue as rollup adoption surges.
