 The ERC-4337 ecosystem saw exponential growth in 2024, with over
103M+ User Operations (UserOps) executed, a 10x increase from 2023,

 GUIDE TO ELLIPTIC CURVE PAIRINGS (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Elliptic curve bilinear pairings allow for advanced cryptography by
mapping points from two elliptic curves to a scalar value while
preserving specific mathematical properties. This article explains how
the pairings are constructed, with a particular focus on the curves
using interesting optimization techniques, like BLS12-381 and BN254.
While traditionally considered complex “moon math,” the outcome is
efficient signature aggregation, multi-party key exchanges, and
zk-SNARK polynomial commitments.
