 A STABLE FUTURE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In a future where stablecoins and blockchain technology are
ubiquitous, digital currencies have revolutionized global finance,
fostering economic inclusivity and redefining value exchange. As AI,
privacy-preserving technologies, and innovative regulation shape this
new era, society must navigate the balance between the benefits of
programmable money and the preservation of individual freedoms, while
collectively striving towards a more equitable and sustainable
economic future. 

 WHY THE WINNERS WON (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Uniswap, DyDx, and Lido had great technology and their mindshare
caused them to establish themselves as premier DeFi protocols. Uniswap
generated a memorable brand by focusing on design simplicity and user
experience. dYdX listened to its customers from the beginning and was
not afraid to pivot from a dApp to its own L2 and finally migrate to a
sovereign chain. Lido's bias for action, exemplified by its use of
permissioned validator sets to start, allowed it to ship quickly and
integrate rapidly with various other protocols.
