 FED ENDS CRYPTO BANK SUPERVISION PROGRAM (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The U.S. Federal Reserve has shut down its “Novel Activities
Supervision Program,” which was created in 2023 to oversee banks
engaging in crypto and fintech partnerships. The Fed said it has
integrated the lessons learned into its standard supervisory process,
rescinding the program's guidance letter. The move continues a broader
regulatory pullback under the Trump administration, with agencies
easing restrictions on banks' crypto involvement and shifting toward
updated rulemaking. 

 NORWAY'S SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND BOOSTS BITCOIN EXPOSURE 83% IN Q2 (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Norges Bank Investment Management, the world's largest sovereign
wealth fund, increased its bitcoin-linked holdings from 6,200 BTC to
11,400 BTC in Q2. The fund's exposure is almost entirely through
MicroStrategy, with a small addition in Metaplanet shares. The
proactive move is part of a broader trend of sovereign entities
gaining indirect BTC exposure.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 GEMINI FILES FOR IPO ON NASDAQ (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gemini has filed a public S-1 to list on Nasdaq under the ticker
GEMI. Revealing a $282.5M net loss in H1 2025 compared to $41.3M in
the same period last year, the filing shows a shift of most users to
its Florida-based Moonbase entity, away from New York's stricter
regulatory regime. Gemini also disclosed a $75M credit agreement with
Ripple, payable in RLUSD stablecoin, marking a deeper partnership as
it aims to become the third U.S.-listed crypto exchange after Coinbase
and Bullish. 

 THE NEXT FRONTIER FOR LIMINAL, UNIT, AND HYPERLIQUID (10 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Hyperliquid, Unit, and Liminal are converging to launch tokenized
delta-neutral strategies through xTokens ($xHYPE, $xBTC, and $xETH)
that represent pooled positions maintaining long spot exposure via
Unit's bridged assets while shorting perps with measured leverage to
capture funding payments. These self-appreciating tokens make
Hyperliquid's native yield portable across HyperEVM and EVM chains,
enabling composability within DeFi protocols like AMMs, lending
markets, and Pendle-style yield trading venues for additional capital
efficiency. The system offers two product lines: Customized for
bespoke self-custody strategies and Tokenized for pooled, scalable
positions that can serve as collateral or yield sources for retail
users, institutions, and protocols.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BEST CRYPTO DEBIT CARDS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The crypto card market, driven by increased crypto adoption and
demand for seamless spending solutions, is experiencing rapid
expansion. It is projected to grow from $1.6 billion in 2024 to $9
billion by 2034. Top performers include MetaMask Card, KAST Card, and
Solayer's Emerald Card. The cards cater to different user priorities,
with options optimized for privacy, low fees, global accessibility, or
ecosystem token rewards. 

 ZORA FLYWHEEL EXPLAINED (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Zora's tokenomics flywheel operates through a 3% trading fee
structure (1% each to creator, platform, and LP) where all assets are
paired with $ZORA, creating consistent buy pressure of 2.5% on every
trade through fees and token sinks. The model addresses a critical
flaw in Virtuals' design by routing all trading volume through
canonical pools, preventing the liquidity fragmentation that weakened
Virtuals when mature tokens migrated to more efficient venues like
Uniswap v3. Despite concerns about the 3% fee sustainability,
precedent exists in NFT markets that sustained $5B monthly volumes
with ~10% fees, and current Solana meme coin trading effectively
approaches 3% when factoring in platform fees, interface costs, and
MEV. Trading volume of Zora coins will be the key performance
indicator as this flywheel mechanism scales, with the token sink
remaining active throughout a creator coin's entire lifecycle rather
than just during initial launch phases.

 THE STATE OF CRYPTO LEVERAGE – Q2 2025 (30 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Crypto leverage expanded significantly across all major sectors in Q2
2025, with DeFi lending reaching an all-time high of $26.47 billion
(+42.11% QoQ), CeFi lending growing to $17.78 billion (+14.66% QoQ),
and futures open interest surging to $132.6 billion (+37.47% QoQ).
Growth was driven by three primary factors: reflexivity between rising
asset prices and borrowing activity, increased demand from digital
asset treasury companies, and the scaling of capital-efficient
collateral strategies in DeFi, particularly Ethena's Liquid Leverage
program with Aave and Pendle principal token looping strategies. The
quarter highlighted DeFi's systemic importance when large ETH
withdrawals from Aave caused borrowing rates to spike above staking
yields, creating a cascading effect that pushed Ethereum's unstaking
queue to a record 13 days. Market concentration remains high, with
Tether commanding 57% of CeFi lending and the combined leverage
ecosystem reaching $53.09 billion in total crypto-collateralized
lending, approaching levels last seen in early 2022. 

 THE AWS MOMENT FOR PAYMENTS (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Circle's Arc and Stripe's rumored Tempo mark the shift to
“payment-native chains” that do for money what AWS did for
compute. They commoditize infrastructure and let competition move up
the stack. With USDC as gas, built-in compliance, and high-throughput
rails, these chains are designed for AI-driven transaction growth and
enterprise adoption. Stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and CBDCs will
coexist as complementary rails, making TradFi backward-compatible with
DeFi.

QUICK LINKS

 CRITICISM OF DATS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DATs must pay corporate income tax on both staking yield and asset
appreciation, are very opaque about their holdings, and their
executive teams take large fees. 

 MAMO EXPANDS INTO MARKET MAKING WITH CBBTC AND MORE (1 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Mamo, the personal finance AI agent, is evolving into a market maker
on Base, now providing liquidity across assets like VIRTUAL, MAMO,
cbBTC, cbXRP, ZORA, EDGE, and TOSHI. 

 REAL YIELD APPS ON BASE ARE THE NEXT CYCLE'S GIANTS (2 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 The biggest returns this cycle won't come from alt-L1s but from
under-the-radar apps on HyperEVM and Base that generate real yield. 

 ETH STAKING FUD DEBUNKED (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Though the queue for unstaking ETH is at an all-time high, so is the
entry queue.
