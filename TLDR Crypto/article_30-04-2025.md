MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SEC DELAYS DECISIONS ON XRP AND DOGECOIN ETFS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The SEC has delayed decisions on the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF and
Franklin XRP Fund until mid-June, citing the need for further review.
The move reflects a broader, more crypto-friendly shift under new SEC
Chair Paul Atkins, as the agency evaluates a growing list of ETF
proposals.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 BASE REACHES 'STAGE 1' IN ETHEREUM ROLLUP DECENTRALIZATION (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Base has officially reached Stage 1 Decentralization by launching
permissionless fault proofs and forming a decentralized Security
Council to oversee contract upgrades, reducing reliance on any single
entity. This milestone strengthens the network's security, resilience,
and neutrality, marking a critical step toward full decentralization
and supporting Base's mission to build a global onchain economy. 

 JUPITER LAUNCHES ULTRA V2 (2 MINUTE READ) [7]

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AZTEC'S JOURNEY (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Aztec, a pioneer in onchain privacy, has evolved from early debt
platforms to building PLONK, a foundational zk-SNARK system now used
across major protocols. Aztec is now developing a fully private,
decentralized Ethereum L2 to enable private apps, social tools, and
more, all rooted in the belief that privacy is essential, not
optional. 

 ASSET CREATION AND THE DEATH OF CAPITAL INEFFICIENCY (35 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Traditional capital markets are buckling under prolonged illiquidity,
misaligned incentives, and rising regulatory costs, leaving
early-stage investors overpaying for speculative assets and late-stage
companies trapped without clear exit paths. Onchain liquidity
bootstrapping platforms allow anyone to issue tokens permissionlessly
and automate price discovery with minimal capital and technical
overhead. These systems eliminate traditional gatekeepers and
inefficiencies by embedding programmable logic into assets and
handling auctions, bonding curves, and AMM pools.

 MICHAEL SAYLOR BELIEVES BITCOIN ETF TO BE WORLD'S BIGGEST (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $2.8 billion in net inflows over the
past six trading days, helping bring Bitcoin from $85,000 to $94,000,
with BlackRock's IBIT ETF attracting $1.3 billion. IBIT holds a $54
billion market cap, while Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF is approximately 10x
bigger. Strategy CEO Michael Saylor forecasts IBIT will be the world's
largest ETF in a decade, while Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted
this would require sustained daily inflows of $3-$4 billion. 

 WHAT HAPPENED TO SUSD, AND HOW DID IT DEPEG? (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Synthetix's sUSD collapsed to $0.68 on April 18 after the protocol
enacted SIP-420, which slashed the collateral requirement from 750% to
200% and replaced individual debt positions with a shared pool. This
change removed users' incentive to repurchase discounted tokens,
leading to sUSD flooding the market. Synthetix's recovery plan will
restore incentives through lockup rewards, new yield pools, and
dynamic debt-holding requirements. It is estimated that under $5
million in buy pressure could reestablish parity.
