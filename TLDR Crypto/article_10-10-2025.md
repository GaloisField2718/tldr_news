MARKETS & BUSINESS

 KRAKEN EXPANDS INTO OIL, GOLD, AND FX FUTURES AHEAD OF IPO (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Kraken is integrating CME Group's traditional futures markets,
including energy, metals, FX, and equity indices, into its US
derivatives platform via Kraken Derivatives US, a regulated futures
commission merchant. The expansion lets traders access CME contracts
like oil, gold, and S&P 500 futures alongside crypto products,
positioning Kraken as an all-in-one platform bridging TradFi and DeFi.
With an IPO reportedly targeted at a $20B valuation, this marks
Kraken's latest step following its $1.5B NinjaTrader acquisition, the
largest crypto-TradFi merger to date. 

 STATE STREET: INSTITUTIONAL CRYPTO EXPOSURE TO DOUBLE BY 2028 (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nearly 60% of institutional investors plan to boost crypto
allocations over the next year, with average exposure set to double
within three years. More than half expect 10–25% of portfolios to be
tokenized by 2030, led by private market assets such as private equity
and debt. Institutions cite transparency, speed, and cost savings as
key drivers, with 40% already operating dedicated digital asset units.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ZK STACK'S ATLAS UPGRADE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ZKsync's Atlas upgrade for ZK Stack features a high-performance
sequencer that achieves over 15,000 TPS with 500ms average transaction
inclusion time, integration with Airbender (the world's fastest
open-source RISC-V zkVM) for one-second block proofs, and native EVM
support through a flexible architecture that allows multiple VM
configurations. Performance benchmarks show 23,000 TPS for
high-frequency oracle price updates, 15,000 TPS for stablecoin
transfers at 0.5 gigagas per second, and 43,000 TPS for native ETH
transfers at 0.9 gigagas per second, with proving costs dropping to
approximately $0.0001 per ERC20 transfer. The upgrade enables
one-second ZK finality where blocks are proved and verified by ZKsync
Gateway at the network edge before settling to Ethereum within
minutes, allowing counterparties to receive cryptographic execution
assurance almost immediately without re-executing transactions or
running full nodes. This architecture supports the vision of many
sovereign chains forming a secure network where banks, enterprises,
and public agencies operate private blockchain infrastructure while
participating in an incorruptible network anchored to Ethereum's
security and liquidity. 

 ETHEREUM FOUNDATION EXPANDS PRIVACY PUSH WITH RESEARCH TEAM (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The Ethereum Foundation has formalized privacy as a core roadmap
pillar by consolidating existing Privacy and Scaling Explorations
experiments like Semaphore, MACI, zkEmail, and Anon Aadhaar under a
new privacy cluster coordinated by Igor Barinov with expanded focus on
private payments, proofs, identity, and enterprise use cases. New
initiatives include private reads/writes for payments and
interactions, portable proofs for identity and asset ownership, zkID
systems for selective disclosure, UX work normalizing privacy tools,
Kohaku SDK and wallet for usable cryptography, and an Institutional
Privacy Task Force translating compliance requirements into
enterprise-testable specifications. The Foundation positions privacy
as essential to Ethereum's credibility for widespread adoption, as
transparent blockchain design requires options for users and
institutions to transact without exposing sensitive data, though
privacy remains politically charged after regulators targeted mixers
and shielded transactions, requiring careful balance between
confidential use enablement and illicit finance prevention.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 TOKEN FUNDRAISING SHOULDN'T EXIST (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 VCs prefer token investments over equity because exits happen within
one year versus 3-7 year IPO/acquisition waits, forcing founders who
don't need tokens to launch them anyway and diverting attention from
product building toward hype creation, community sentiment management,
and mindshare battles rather than revenue generation or utility
creation. Token launches require massive spending on separate teams,
security audits, KOL budgets, market makers, and exchange listings,
explaining why projects raise significantly more via tokens than
equity and why zkSync maintains a $500 million market cap with only
$50 in onchain revenue. The system creates two founder types: those
genuinely wanting to build but forced into token models, and grifters
like Blast and Movement who design slow-rug protocols using buzzwords
and show-off marketing to extract value from secondary buyers and
retail who provide the $200 million liquidity pools needed for $20
million raises to achieve 10x exits. Alignment between teams and
investors ends at unlock dates when investors dump, while founders
face longer vesting, leading to OTC sales through market makers or
insider trading via buying low, pumping, and dumping high, with
examples like Privy and Flashbots demonstrating successful equity-only
models while meaningful token utility remains limited to L1s and core
DeFi protocols where tokens integrate fundamentally into products. 

 HOW V4 TURNS AAVE INTO DEFI'S OPERATING SYSTEM (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Aave V4 solves the liquidity fragmentation problem where V3's
separate markets like Core ($60 billion) and Prime ($2 billion) cannot
share liquidity despite holding the same assets, forcing each new
specialized market to bootstrap deposits from zero even though Aave
holds tens of billions in existing liquidity. The new architecture
separates liquidity storage in Hubs from market logic in Spokes,
allowing multiple specialized Spokes to draw from shared Hubs based on
governance-set credit line allocations, enabling new markets to access
Aave's existing depth from day one rather than competing for the same
deposits. Spokes enable previously unviable markets, including custom
collateral for Ethena's sUSDe and Pendle PTs, institutional
segregation requirements, secondary debt position markets, credit
against AMM positions with dynamic LTV adjustments, and fixed-tenor
credit matching while unmatched liquidity continues earning yield from
underlying Hubs. The system creates positive feedback loops where each
successful Spoke makes the platform more attractive to next builders
through better liquidity utilization, specialized features without
asset fragmentation, and innovation atop proven infrastructure rather
than repeated bootstrapping.
