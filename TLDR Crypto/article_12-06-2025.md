MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SENATE BEGINS PASSAGE OF STABLECOIN BILL (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Senate cleared a 68-30 cloture vote on the GENIUS Act, virtually
guaranteeing final passage of the first US stablecoin bill and ending
years of Senate gridlock on crypto policy. The legislation, which aims
to strengthen dollar dominance, will let state- or
federally-supervised entities issue dollar-backed tokens under a
unified framework. Parallel momentum in the House saw the Digital
Asset Market Clarity Act pass through both Financial Services and
Agriculture Committees, setting up potential coordination or
reconciliation between the bills. Together, the advances mark the
strongest bipartisan push yet toward comprehensive U.S. crypto
regulation. 

 META'S STABLECOIN PLAN QUESTIONED BY DEMOCRATS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal pressed Meta to
disclose its stablecoin strategy, asking whether the company has
lobbied for the Senate's GENIUS Act and if it plans to launch or own a
stablecoin issuer despite proposals to bar Big Tech from doing so.
Their letter cites privacy, anticompetitive, and consumer-protection
concerns, warning that a Meta-run token could extend the firm's
data-harvesting reach and enable “surveillance pricing.” The
senators also demanded an explanation of how any new effort differs
from Meta's abandoned Libra/Diem project. The inquiry landed hours
before the Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act.

 STRIPE ACQUIRES WALLET PROVIDER PRIVY (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Privy, a wallet-as-a-service provider powering over 75 million
accounts and more than 1,000 developer teams, has agreed to be
acquired by Stripe, though it will continue to run as an independent
product. The deal lets Privy tap Stripe's scale while broadening
Stripe's push to blur the line between fiat and crypto payments,
offering developers built-in wallet creation, transaction signing, and
onchain integrations alongside Stripe's existing fintech stack.
Privy's traction, with billions of dollars in transactions and
adoption by companies like Hyperliquid, Blackbird, Toku, and
Farcaster, highlights growing demand for embedded crypto rails that
feel as seamless as conventional web tooling. 

 POLYGON FOUNDER TAKES CEO ROLE, UNVEILS PIVOT TO POS AND AGGLAYER (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal has assumed the role of CEO at the
Polygon Foundation, announcing major strategic shifts to focus solely
on Polygon PoS and Agglayer. The zkEVM will be deprecated in 2025,
while PoS aims to scale to 5,000+ TPS this year and 100K+ in the long
term. Agglayer v0.3 rolls out June 30, with spinoffs like Polygon ZisK
and airdrops planned for POL stakers. With SEC scrutiny of MATIC
dropped and market makers returning, Nailwal signals a return to
“zero-to-one” execution driving speed, clarity, and brand
alignment across the Polygon ecosystem.

 8 AIRDROPS YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Airdrops remain one of the easiest ways to earn free crypto in 2025.
These eight under-the-radar opportunities span DeFi DEXs, abstraction
layers, and social-fi platforms: Hyperliquid, Meteora, Abstract,
Pump.fun, Axiom, Monad, Farcaster, and Kaito. Despite claims of
saturation, disciplined engagement—using protocol swaps, providing
liquidity, staking in designated pools, or “yapping” on social-fi
leaderboards—can unlock substantial token rewards. These airdrops
underscore a broader trend toward gamified, incentive-driven growth
mechanisms across the ecosystem. Ignoring them risks leaving free
money on the table. 

 INTERESTING PROJECTS TO WATCH (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A wave of emerging crypto apps is gaining traction across DeFi,
stablecoins, AI agents, and SocialFi, from Falcon's synthetic
stablecoin and Avantis' multi-asset perps to Noice's tipping app and
Giza's agent platform. Several, like Resolv and Defidot, have launched
tokens or airdrops, while others like Coinshift and Turtle Clubhouse
are experimenting with yield and bootstrapping campaigns.

 PITCHED MULTIPLE STABLECOIN PRODUCTS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There are a flood of stablecoin infra pitches lacking clarity on what
infrastructure is actually owned versus white-labeled. The ability to
directly execute and settle money movement, not just wrap third-party
primitives, is what defines reliability, cost, and risk. In a crowded
market, transparency about infrastructure ownership could be a key
differentiator and trust signal. 

 ARBITRUM AND THE VIBEKIT (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Arbitrum's new Vibekit is an open-source MCP-based toolkit that lets
developers build AI-driven DeFi experiences across frameworks like
Eliza, RIG, and LangGraph. It offers modular servers for inference,
perpetual trading, yield strategies, and verifiable on-chain
predictions. It also enables personalized strategies, instant position
adjustments, and AI-powered market-making with low slippage and strong
capital efficiency.
