Hashnote, the issuer of the largest tokenized money market fund
(USYC); a strategic partnership with global trading firm DRW to drive
adoption of USDC and USYC across crypto and traditional finance; and

AND GAMES (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Telegram has announced an exclusive partnership with The Open Network
(TON) that will require all crypto-enabled mini apps and games on its
platform to use the TON blockchain exclusively. The messaging platform
and its 950 million active users will only allow non-TON chains for
bridging. The TON Foundation is offering up to $50,000 grants for
affected projects that transition within 30 days. TON was originally
created by Telegram but spun out in 2020 due to regulatory concerns.

 DEFAI: THE RISE OF TRADING AGENTS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Autonomous trading agents are transforming the DeFi landscape by
automating complex strategies, analyzing data, and executing trades
efficiently, eliminating human effort while generating consistent
alpha. Platforms like Cod3x, Almanak, and Sekoia are leading the
charge with user-friendly tools, real-time performance tracking, and
innovative frameworks for agent collaboration, while ecosystems like
Virtuals further push boundaries by fostering investment in
cutting-edge microcap tokens and agent-driven projects. 

 WHY (GOOD) AI NEEDS CRYPTO (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI development is following social media's path toward
centralization, with foundation model training costing hundreds of
millions of dollars and creating insurmountable barriers for new
entrants. While open source alternatives exist, they face a
“resource problem” where contributors must provide both time and
significant compute/data resources, making traditional open source
development models unfeasible for AI. Crypto-based ownership models
could solve this by incentivizing resource providers to contribute
compute and data to open source AI projects, potentially enabling
larger models than closed systems.
