 MASTERCARD LAUNCHES CRYPTO DEBIT CARD IN EUROPE: SPEND FROM
SELF-CUSTODIAL WALLETS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Mastercard has introduced a crypto Euro debit card in partnership
with Mercuryo. The card allows users to spend crypto from their
self-custodial wallets at over 100M merchants. This initiative
integrates crypto into daily transactions, improving user control over
their funds while advancing Mastercard's commitment to embedding
digital assets in the mainstream economy. 

 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE $MATIC TO $POL UPGRADE (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The MATIC token is rebranding to POL to align with the Polygon
branding. With the AggLayer interoperability solution being the
primary point of focus for the Polygon team, POL will be seen as the
‚ÄúAggLayer token‚Äù and will allow for staking on multiple chains.
MATIC will be automatically migrated to POL on the Polygon PoS chain,
but everyone else must use a migration contract.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 POLYMARKET BINGO CARDS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Polymarket has launched a new betting format called Polymarket Bingo,
where users bet on a bingo card filled with various phrases expected
to be mentioned in debates rather than simple yes/no bets on single
words. This format is more challenging but offers higher returns
because players fill the bingo card by matching multiple phrases, with
trading for these bets starting at around 20 cents. 

 INFINITYVM: ENSHRINING OFFCHAIN COMPUTE (42 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 InfinityVM introduces a new execution architecture that natively
integrates offchain compute. It aims to overcome the limits of
traditional blockchain models by allowing apps to execute offchain
while ensuring only honest results are included onchain. It also
enables ZK proofs without constraints, allowing results to be utilized
instantly. Thanks to InfinityVM, blockchains can become mechanisms for
trustlessly verifying centralized compute, combining the performance
of optimized servers with blockchain guarantees.

 GLUE AND COPROCESSOR ARCHITECTURES (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Modern resource-heavy computation is split into two parts: complex
but light ‚Äúbusiness logic‚Äù and intensive but structured
‚Äúexpensive work.‚Äù This pattern, called the glue and coprocessor
architecture, is increasingly prevalent in Ethereum, AI, and
programmable cryptography. Glue prioritizes generalizability and
flexibility, while coprocessors focus on efficiency for specific
tasks. By optimizing for different parts of computation separately,
performance, security, and developer-friendliness are improved. 

 THE VALUE DEFI BRINGS TO ETHEREUM IN 4 CHARTS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DEX trades comprised 44% of gas spent in the past month. DeFi has
contributed to 49% of ETH burned since the merge. Around 76,000
addresses interact with DeFi applications daily on Ethereum, and over
57% ($46.2B) of TVL.

 TELEGRAM'S HISTORY: FROM ITS EARLY DAYS TO TONCOIN AND CONTROVERSIES
(10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 From its start focusing on privacy and innovative features like
encryption and expiring messages, Telegram has grown significantly
while continually clashing with governments over privacy issues.
Despite setbacks like the halted TON blockchain project, Telegram
continues to be a major messaging platform that is pushing boundaries
by leveraging crypto while maintaining user privacy and content
security. 

 A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT ON CENTRALIZATION AND FORKING AND BTC PURITY (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 With over $100B+ of centralized stablecoins on chains like Ethereum
and Solana, Circle and Tether have outsized influence over future
chain forks. If the government decides to fork Ethereum, it could
force Tether and Circle to comply. This is the primary reason a chain
like Bitcoin, with little centralized control and a decentralized
store-of-value asset, remains unique: you can't be the best payment
rails and a pure SOV asset.
