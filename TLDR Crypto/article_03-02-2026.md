 WHY ISSUE YOUR OWN STABLECOIN WITH BRIDGE (A STRIPE COMPANY)
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Stablecoins power trillions of dollars in global money-movement,
however, the economics are concentrated: a few players keep most
yield, set fees, and control user experience—limiting choice and
revenue for builders.

With Bridge's Open Issuance [4], any business can launch their own
stablecoin in days to earn rewards on reserves and choose how to
distribute.

→ DAY-ONE ADOPTION TOOLS: use Bridge + Stripe infrastructure to
accept, store, spend, and move your stablecoin

→ OWN DESIGN CHOICES: set reserves, fees, chains, and rewards.

→ BUILT-IN LIQUIDITY: stablecoins launched on the Open Issuance are
interoperable, enabling easy conversions.

→ GET TO MARKET QUICKLY: Bridge handles liquidity, reserves, and
GENIUS readiness so you can focus on adoption.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 FORGET 'DIGITAL GOLD': TRADERS ARE FLEEING TO STABLECOINS (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Despite the crypto market expanding to thousands of altcoins and
gaining institutional adoption, 2026 price action demonstrates that
the market still moves in lockstep with bitcoin, offering little real
diversification as BTC's 14% year-to-date decline to $75,000 has
dragged nearly all of the crypto sectors down. Paradoxically,
revenue-generating protocols have declined alongside Bitcoin despite
producing actual cash flows, while industry narratives continue
labeling BTC, ETH, and SOL as "safe havens," with some arguing the
industry needs to build consensus around truly resilient sectors like
DeFi, similar to how traditional markets designated consumer staples
and utilities as defensive. Stablecoins have emerged as the true
defensive allocation in crypto. 

 ETHEREUM FOUNDATION ENTERS AUSTERITY (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Ethereum Foundation is implementing austerity measures to balance
its aggressive technical roadmap with long-term financial
sustainability, prompting Vitalik Buterin to withdraw 16,384 ETH for
personal funding of infrastructure projects previously handled by the
foundation. The funds will support open-source development across
multiple domains, including Vensa's open silicon initiative,
zero-knowledge and fully homomorphic encryption tools, encrypted
messaging applications, and privacy-preserving software stacks. The
strategic shift narrows EF's focus to core protocol development while
deprioritizing broad adoption in favor of self-sovereignty and
censorship resistance over enterprise use cases.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 AERODROME'S MOMENTUM FUND (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Aerodrome Foundation is launching the Momentum Fund, an algorithmic
buyback engine that acquires AERO tokens based on market volatility
rather than fixed schedules or discretionary decisions. The system
accumulates veAERO voting rewards during stable markets and scales
buyback allocation proportionally when volatility exceeds historical
averages. A pilot run beginning in Epoch 111 acquired 8.7 million AERO
(averaging 670k per epoch), capturing 27.5% of all weekly emissions
during peak volatility in Epoch 122. The Momentum Fund will
consolidate the Public Goods Fund and Flight School programs while
introducing buyback-and-burn functionality. 

 DAKOTA'S STABLECOIN INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORM (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dakota launched a stablecoin infrastructure platform that packages
licensing, compliance, custody, and global money movement as managed
services for fintech builders. The platform aims to compress the
traditional 12-18 month, multi-million dollar product launch timeline
by abstracting regulatory and operational complexity into reusable
infrastructure. By handling the plumbing layer, Dakota enables teams
to deploy specialized, programmable money products without rebuilding
foundational financial rails.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 HOW I WOULD DO CREATOR COINS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new creator coin model after arguing
that projects like BitClout and Zora failed because they elevate
already-famous people rather than surface quality content. The system
uses non-token-based creator DAOs (modeled on Protocol Guild) with
~200 opinionated members who vote creators in and out, while anyone
can launch creator coins that get burned using proceeds when admitted
to a DAO. This transforms token speculators from recursive-speculation
participants into predictors of DAO admission decisions, making
high-value content creators the ultimate arbiters while speculators
surface promising talent. 

 HOW YOUR AGENT CAN USE X402 SKILLS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Clawmart is a website where agents can find and pay for new skills
via x402. As agents move from static, developer-managed programs to
self-improving autonomous entities, economic independence will be one
of the final problems to solve before AI becomes fully autonomous and
independent from its creators. Agents can also earn revenue and fund
their hosting fees by posting new skills on Clawmart, and establish
the backbone of the nascent agentic economy.

 FRAME TRANSACTIONS COULD UNLOCK ETHEREUM'S CLEANEST UX YET (1 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 EIP-8141 proposes a new frame transaction type that lets a single
transaction bundle call from multiple identities, enabling native
multicall and simpler gas sponsorship without paymasters. This
eliminates extra approval steps and reduces gas-heavy app-layer
bundling. It has the potential to significantly cut user friction and
churn. 

 THE MATHEMATICS OF THE PURGE: WHY ADOPTION WON'T STOP THE DRAWDOWN (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Rising utility does not hedge valuation risk. The current drawdown
will cut deeper because markets punish broken math the same way they
punished internet stocks in 2000. This means adoption can grow while
prices collapse. Supply-side realities matter more than hype. Cheap
blockspace, elastic chain supply, and value capture moving up the
stack mean many infrastructure tokens lack a math-backed case for
current multiples, so expect prolonged price pain even as real usage
continues to rise.
