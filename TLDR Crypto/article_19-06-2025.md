 TRUMP ON GENIUS STABLECOIN BILL: ‘GET IT TO MY DESK, ASAP' (10
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 President Trump has called on the House to pass the GENIUS Act
“LIGHTNING FAST” after its 68–30 approval in the Senate, urging
lawmakers to send the stablecoin bill to his desk without delay or
amendments. The GENIUS Act establishes a regulatory framework for US
dollar-pegged stablecoins, requiring 1:1 reserves, licensing, AML
compliance, and strict reserve usage rules to mitigate financial risk.
Proponents argue it would cement US leadership in digital assets,
while critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, warn of potential
conflicts of interest tied to Trump's crypto ventures. The bill now
heads to a closely divided House, where Republican support will be
critical for final passage. 

 TREASURY SECRETARY BESSENT SAYS CRYPTO WILL 'LOCK IN' DOLLAR
SUPREMACY (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that stablecoins could help
“lock in” the dollar's global dominance by becoming major buyers
of US Treasurys, positioning crypto as a strategic asset for the US
economy. Bessent projected the USD-backed stablecoin market could
exceed $2 trillion within three years, up from today's $240 billion.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE COMMERCE PAYMENT PROTOCOL POWERING SHOPIFY (20 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Coinbase and Shopify have launched the Commerce Payments Protocol on
Base, enabling trust-minimized, multi-step payment flows that meet the
needs of real-world commerce. The protocol introduces a smart
contract-based escrow system that supports operations like authorize,
capture, refund, and void, bringing the flexibility of traditional
payment systems to onchain transactions. It also introduces the
concept of operators as trusted entities that facilitate transactions
without compromising user intent or security. Now powering USDC
payments across Shopify merchants, this open protocol lays the
groundwork for scalable, composable crypto commerce accessible to
developers worldwide. 

 ACCOUNT ABSTRACTION (EIP-7702) ON SONIC (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sonic is activating EIP-7702, enabling account abstraction for all
users without new wallet addresses. This lets accounts delegate to
smart contracts and gain features like batch transactions, social
recovery, custom gas payments, and app-level authentication. With
Sonic's native Fee Monetization system, developers can sponsor gas
sustainably, turning wallets into programmable revenue engines while
users gain flexibility and security at the protocol level.

 ⛺PACKAGE DEAL: ACROSS LAUNCHES ON BNB SMART CHAIN, BSC NATIVE
PANCAKESWAP INTEGRATES ACROSS (SPONSOR) [8] 

 Across, crypto's fastest and cheapest interop solution, is now live
on BSC — enabling seamless crosschain swaps [8] between BSC,
Arbitrum, and Base on PancakeSwap. Across is also expanding into the
BNB Chain ecosystem and now connects over 20 L1s and L2s, including
Arbitrum, Hyperliquid and Unichain. Start building on Across [8] 

 DEFI DERIVATIVES: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW (45 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DeFi derivatives have surged in adoption since 2020, now holding
$5.37B in TVL with daily volumes rivaling centralized exchanges, but
they face structural challenges around liquidity, execution, and
scaling. There are tradeoffs across design choices (AMM vs. orderbook,
cross-margin models, and clearing layers) and it can be difficult to
transition protocols (e.g., GMX and dYdX) without fragmenting users or
liquidity. While TradFi still wins on capital efficiency and margin
infrastructure, DeFi offers unmatched permissionless innovation and
global access, positioning it as the future of derivatives settlement
once scaling and interoperability are resolved. 

 PENDLE THESIS: “THE BEST STABLECOIN BETA PLAY?” (60 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Stablecoins are entering a hyper-growth phase, evidenced by trading
volumes outpacing PayPal 20x and Visa 3x and Circle's IPO being 25×
oversubscribed. By tokenizing yield-bearing assets into Principal and
Yield Tokens, Pendle has secured 30% of the fast-growing YBS market
and deployed 80% of its $7 billion TVL in stablecoins, delivering
$35–40 million in annualized revenue. Upcoming launches, including
Boros for perpetual funding-rate tokenization and Citadel for
cross-chain and institutional markets, promise to dramatically expand
Pendle's addressable market and push annual revenues toward $100
million. Trading at a sub-20 P/E despite Circle's 80x multiple,
Pendle's entrenched network effects, vePENDLE governance model, and
revenue-sharing mechanics suggest significant upside as stablecoin
adoption accelerates.

 INSIDE WEB3 MARKETING (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Web3 Key opinion leader (KOL) marketing is evolving toward
micro-influencer campaigns using tools like Kaito and Cookie3 to score
authenticity, but most agencies still rely heavily on a small core of
trusted creators. While micro-KOLs offer decentralization, they risk
echo chambers and overexposure, whereas classic paid KOLs often fail
to convert unless the product is genuinely strong. Long-term
relationships, cross-engagement, and authentic content remain the most
effective strategies, especially on platforms beyond X like Telegram
and Substack. 

 NEW L1/L2 PLAYBOOK (16 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Platforms live or die by killer applications rather than raw
throughput or low fees. Without a flagship app, a blockchain is the
on-chain equivalent of a console with no games. New chains today
succeed either by delivering a rare 10x technical leap or, more
reliably, by building a breakout app first and then spinning the
underlying infrastructure into a dedicated chain. Hyperliquid and
Abstract exemplify this app-first flywheel: obsessive product focus
attracts users, which fuels tailored chain adoption, liquidity
inflows, and a widening moat. Going forward, the most enduring
blockchains will debut as must-use games, financial tools, or social
networks that prove product-market fit before protocol-market fit.
