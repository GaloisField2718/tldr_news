GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 NOT SO SAFE (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 North Korean hackers pulled off the largest crypto heist in history,
stealing $1.4 billion from Bybit's Safe multisig, not with
cutting-edge exploits, but by socially engineering a developer into
running a malicious Docker project. The attack exposed glaring
security flaws in DeFi, proving that even the most battle-tested
protocols are only as strong as their weakest human link. 

 PRIVACY 2.0: PETS AND THE PROMISE OF PRIVATE SHARED STATE (20 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Privacy 1.0's isolated tools, like dark pools, limit composability
due to the absence of private shared state, constraining broader
adoption beyond niche users. Privacy 2.0's use of privacy enhancing
technologies (PETs) â€“ trusted execution environments (TEEs),
multi-party computation (MPC), and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)
â€“ to enable private, reusable data for collaborative computation,
promises interoperable use cases like World ID's portable identity.
Though current PET implementations face trust, efficiency, and
standardization challenges, their advancement could unlock a new wave
of privacy-driven blockchain innovation.
