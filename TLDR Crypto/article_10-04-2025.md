MARKETS & BUSINESS

 BITCOIN HAS TWO â€˜FAVORABLE ADVANTAGES' IN THIS MARKET (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Bitcoin is showing strength in a cautious market because of its
status as a defensible store of value and its deep integration with
traditional capital through ETFs. However, if Bitcoin sells off
further, altcoins could face sharper losses given their higher
volatility and lack of strong demand catalysts. 

 MAGIC EDEN ACQUIRES SLINGSHOT (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Magic Eden has acquired Slingshot, a chain-abstracted trading app
that lets users trade any crypto asset across any blockchain using a
single, universal USDC balance â€“ no bridging or wallet switching
needed. The move aims to simplify on-chain trading and bring Magic
Eden closer to offering a seamless, user-friendly platform that
competes with centralized exchanges.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 TAURUS LAUNCHES INTERBANK DIGITAL ASSET NETWORK (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Taurus has launched an interbank digital asset network designed to
streamline settlement and collateralization processes by enabling
members to pledge funds or assets for instant credit within the
network. 

 BINANCE TO LAUNCH LDUSDT, A SECOND 'REWARD-BEARING MARGIN ASSET' (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Binance's LDUSDT is a reward-bearing margin asset that allows users
to convert their locked USDT from Binance's Simple Earn Flexible
Product into a margin asset for futures trading, enabling them to earn
passive rewards while engaging in futures trading.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 STABLECOINS: PAYMENTS WITHOUT INTERMEDIARIES (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stablecoins are a transformative alternative to traditional payment
systems that eliminate middlemen, reduce transaction fees, and enable
near-instantaneous cross-border transfers. While legacy financial
networks, with high costs, delays, and regulatory hurdles, hinder
global commerce and exclude billions from efficient financial access,
stablecoins are gaining adoption for real-world applications like
treasury management and faster payouts and have the potential to
disrupt both B2B and B2C transactions. 

 TESTNET APPROVALS WON'T AFFECT YOUR REAL ASSETS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Approving tokens on testnets like Sepolia or Goerli won't put your
real crypto at risk since testnets are separate networks used for safe
experimentation with no real monetary value involved.

 AI AND VERIFIABILITY (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This deep dive explores the growing importance of verifiable AI in
decentralized ecosystems, highlighting the technical frameworks
ensuring AI outputs are accurate, secure, and trust-minimized. From
Zero-Knowledge ML and Proof-of-Sampling to privacy-preserving TEEs, it
showcases how protocols like EigenLayer, Mira, Atoma, Fortytwo, and
ORA are paving the way for a future where AI can be both powerful and
provable. 

 THE INTENT VALUE CHAIN (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The â€˜Intent Value Chain' is a new way to understand how user
actions in crypto, like swapping or bridging tokens, move from simple
expressions of intent to complex, cross-chain transactions handled by
specialized solvers. This post explores how the model aims to simplify
crypto's multi-chain chaos, the risks of centralization, and the
emerging tools and standards working to ensure a more open,
decentralized future.

 ROMANTICIZING CRYPTO IN A TARIFFED WORLD (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 In a world where tariffs and nationalism shape economies, crypto
offers a parallel ecosystem â€“ one built on permissionless access,
global collaboration, and economic freedom that isn't dictated by
borders or bureaucrats. 

 WHERE MONEY MOVES - EDITION #2 (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 It is clear that stablecoins are becoming foundational to modern
economic infrastructure. 

 KAITO'S INFOFI VISION (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Kaito is pioneering a new paradigm called InfoFi, which blends AI's
semantic understanding with crypto's financial coordination to
monetize information itself, enabling sovereign data ownership,
market-driven truth, and open info markets. 

 BITCOIN MINERS ACCELERATING IMPORTS TO AVOID TARIFFS (1 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 To avoid tariffs, U.S. Bitcoin miners are rushing to import over
$860M in mining equipment, with some even chartering $2â€“3.5M flights
before new trade policies take effect that will potentially raise
equipment prices by 22â€“36%.
