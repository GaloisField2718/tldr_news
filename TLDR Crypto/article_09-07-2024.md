INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ON ORCHESTRATING PARALLEL BROADCASTS FOR DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS (9
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This paper discusses the concept of ticketing for managing slot
allocation in blockchain consensus mechanisms. It proposes a Hybrid
Ticketing Regime (HTR) that combines managed and unmanaged ticketing
approaches to optimize performance and resilience in various network
conditions. The detailed overview describes desired characteristics
for ticketing schemes, explains the HTR's implementation, and presents
a comparative analysis demonstrating superior adaptability and fault
tolerance. 

 MULTIPLE CONCURRENT LEADERS (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Solana's approach to minimizing MEV is to maximize competition
between block producers, which involves having multiple leaders users
can choose from for transaction inclusion. This post details the
technical aspects of configuring several leaders, including block
transmission, merging concurrent blocks, and managing transaction
ordering. The proposal for multiple leaders aims to create a global
permissionless price discovery engine competitive with CEXs.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 TOKEN LISTING STRATEGY PLAYBOOK (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post provides a comprehensive token listing strategy advising
founders on navigating the process of listing on centralized exchanges
(CEX) that involves providing necessary documentation, negotiating
with CEXs and market makers, community building, media strategies, and
other miscellaneous preparations required to successfully launch and
promote a token. The post emphasizes the importance of funding
strategies, strong community engagement, having a strong media
presence, and striking partnerships with venture arms of large
exchanges to improve the likelihood of a successful listing and
subsequent token performance. 

 AIRDROP ANALYSIS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 23 out of the 31 tokens in this analysis are down since their airdrop
launch date, with only four beating BTC. Users are almost always
better off immediately selling and buying back later, as high fully
diluted valuations mean investors must be confident in future demand
to outpace token unlocks. The only potential takeaway from airdrop
designs is that low valuation and a surprise factor might be the ideal
approach.

 A BLOG POST ON HOW FAMILY WALLET WAS BUILT (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Family is a self-custody crypto wallet for iOS that prioritizes
simplicity, fluidity, and delight in its design. The app focuses on
creating a welcoming and engaging user experience by gradually
revealing features, ensuring smooth transitions, and incorporating
delightful touches throughout every interaction. This post by the
founder covers their approach to building Family. 

 BTC'S SECURITY MODEL IS BROKEN? (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Bitcoin's security model is unsustainable because it requires the
cryptocurrency's value to double every four years or necessitate very
high transaction fees, both of which are impractical. The reduction in
the block reward every halving severely lowers miner incentives,
leading to decreased security and potential vulnerability to attacks.
Significant changes, such as increasing Bitcoin's supply or accepting
extremely high fees, are needed.
