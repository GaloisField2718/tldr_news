 TRUMP'S CRYPTO DINNERS IN RAISE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 President Trump announced a “Crypto & AI Innovation Dinner”
hosted by MAGA Inc., following a previously planned gala for top
$TRUMP memecoin holders. The events coincided with a 50% surge in
$TRUMP trading and revelations that Trump Organization insiders
control 80% of the token's supply, earning $325 million in fees since
January. Trump denied any personal profit, framing crypto as a counter
to China and downplaying the token's price. Legal experts are split,
with some raising ethical concerns and others deeming the events
legally permissible.

DEVS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bitcoin Core developers have proposed removing the 80-byte size cap
on OP_RETURN outputs, calling the restriction outdated and frequently
bypassed in less secure ways. The proposal has drawn criticism from
those concerned about a lack of community consensus and the risk of
increased blockchain spam.

 ACROSS PRIME (1 MINUTE READ) [6]

model that enables users to send funds directly to relayers without
locking them in escrow. This bonded design improves capital and gas

separate claim transactions. 

 INTRODUCING X402 (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Coinbase has introduced x402, an open-source payments protocol that
activates the dormant HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code. It
enables on-chain payments through standard web infrastructure,
allowing developers to monetize APIs and content via microtransactions
without relying on subscriptions or complex billing systems.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 AI TRENDS IN THE TRENCHES (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The AI agent sector is booming, driven by Virtuals' “Genesis
Launch” model that blends point-based incentives with fixed supply
to generate short-term returns and boost valuations. While favoring
hype and trading over core product development, this dynamic creates
an opening for DeFi protocols to offer real yield strategies.
Revenue-sharing models, where trading fees fund creator treasuries and
buybacks, are gaining traction. Still, Virtuals' dominance may wane as
alternative launchpads and decentralized AI infrastructure platforms
emerge. 

 BITCOIN CORE DEBATE (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A debate is unfolding within the Bitcoin Core community regarding a
proposal to lift limits on OP_RETURN, a transaction feature that
stores data. Critics warn of potential blockchain spam and abuse,
while proponents argue it's a necessary update to accommodate
legitimate data use more securely.

 STEPPING DOWN AS A UNISWAP DELEGATE (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Pepo, a respected Uniswap DAO contributor, is stepping down as a
delegate. After consistently offering critical feedback and
challenging governance narratives, he expressed frustration that his
independence was penalized as the Foundation began prioritizing
loyalty over transparency. He argues that Uniswap governance has
become performative, validating pre-determined outcomes rather than
encouraging meaningful debate.
