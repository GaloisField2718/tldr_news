totaling ~$18M in crypto. This reflects a growing trend among
government pension funds, both in the U.S. and internationally, toward
crypto investments.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 SPACECOIN XYZ UNVEILS PLANS FOR FIRST BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK IN OUTER
SPACE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Spacecoin has announced plans to create the first blockchain in
space. It uses a two-tier architecture with a space-based “Celestial
Chain” L1 and an Earth-based “Uncelestial” L2. Spacecoin has
already launched three test satellites. The project aims to facilitate
a future space economy and secure space-based data centers leveraging
the inaccessibility of satellites. 

 SCROLL SDK & GADGETS: BUILDING THE FOUNDATION FOR ETHEREUM'S
MULTICHAIN FUTURE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scroll has launched an SDK platform that allows developers to deploy
zkEVM-based L2s in minutes. It also introduced Gadgets, opt-in modules
for customizing chain functionality without vendor lock-in. The first
Gadget focuses on interoperability between chains using TEEs and zk
proofs. Scroll's roadmap extends through Q2 2025, promising enhanced
capabilities including high-performance nodes that support >100M
gas/second throughput, multi-proof support, and additional specialized
Gadgets for staking and keystore functionality.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 FULL DAS SAMPLING ANALYSIS (25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A comprehensive analysis of Ethereum's Data Availability Sampling
(DAS) system demonstrates that under normal conditions and modest
networking requirements, the network can effectively perform sampling
while maintaining decentralization, with nodes needing to download
only 1MB of data per slot in most cases. While the system is robust
against large correlated failures affecting up to 35% of nodes, there
are challenges with coordinated attacks involving a malicious
supermajority (90% of nodes). The study validates the viability of the
proposed model where data custody responsibilities scale with the
number of validators. 

 3 UPCOMING CRYPTO GAMES YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Eternum is an MMO game on Starknet with real-time strategy and
exploration elements on an infinite map. EVE Frontier, developed by
the creators of the massive multiplayer game EVE Online, is a AAA
experience built using Redstone L2 tech that allows players to create
modular structures in space. Parallel Colony is using Wayfinder to
create AI NPCs that have deep interactions within the game world.

 FARCASTER'S GROWING AGENTIC ECONOMY (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The goal of the agentic economy is to move the Internet from
search-based to action-based, where intents and solvers abstract the
majority of steps away from the end-user. Thanks to web3, agents can
have access to permissionless rails to execute social, financial, and
collaborative tasks. As a decentralized social platform, Farcaster has
a unique opportunity to become the hub of agents and agent
orchestration, and projects like Supercast and Neynar are leaning into
this vision. Agents can be added to onchain company accounts and split
revenue with teams when it does things like earn tips or create
artwork. 

 WHY EVERYONE'S WRONG ABOUT STABLECOINS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Relying solely on T-Bill interest is unsustainable - issuers will
need complementary business models to survive. Pure-play stablecoin
issuers like Circle and Tether face challenges from traditional
institutions, which can issue deposit tokens and leverage existing
infrastructure more effectively. Multiple interoperable stablecoins
may coexist in the future - success will be determined by
complementary business models and control over banking infrastructure
rather than network effects alone.
