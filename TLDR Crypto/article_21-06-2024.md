 GERMANY BEGINS SELLING ITS BITCOIN BILLIONS, TRIGGERING VOLATILITY
FEARS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The German government has begun selling the $3 billion of Bitcoin it
seized from a movie piracy website. It has sold over $195 million in
BTC in the past day and moved coins between wallets. Analysts believe
this demonstrates bearish sentiment from the government and could
cause short-term market volatility. 

 THE CFTC IS PROBING JUMP CRYPTO, PREVIOUSLY ONE OF THE SECTOR'S
BIGGEST PLAYERS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating trading
firm Jump's involvement in the crypto industry. Jump Crypto is one of
the most active market makers and investors. It has helped develop
Wormhole, Pyth, and Solana's Firedancer client. Jump's controversies
include Wormhole's $325 million hack, being a market maker for FTX,
and being accused by the SEC of propping up Terra's stablecoin peg.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ENSV2: THE PATH TO THE FUTURE OF NAMING (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ENS has a 5-phase plan to transition to an L2 and complete its v2
roadmap. Phases 1 and 2 will introduce standards for an interface and
decide which L2 framework to use. Phases 3 and 4 will deploy the L2,
initial contracts, and migrate to the new system. Phase 5 will re-open
registrations and continue ENS where it left off. 

 THE TALLY PROTOCOL: THE NEXT STEP FORWARD IN ONCHAIN GOVERNANCE (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Tally Protocol introduces an innovative liquidity layer for
governance tokens, enabling staking, restaking, and optimized voting
power distribution to enhance economic security for blockchain
protocols. It aims to improve DAO security and governance efficiency
by providing Tally Liquid Staked Tokens (tLSTs) and incentivizing
active governance.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 SEVEN EMERGING CRYPTO TRENDS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Some projects are pivoting and rebranding, like IOTA becoming an RWA
L2 and the upcoming ASI token merger between Fetch, Ocean, and
SingularityNet. Point farming gamification, as popularized by Sanctum,
has created greater community engagement. Consultants like Gauntlet
and other ‚ÄúMcKinseys of DeFi‚Äù manage user assets and risk on
platforms like Morpho. Onboarding is finally becoming Web2-like thanks
to Coinbase Smart Wallet and other services. 

 ON ROLLUPS - NORMAL, SOVEREIGN, AND BASED (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The top five rollups are all general-purpose EVMs with DA on Ethereum
blobs, a centralized sequencer, and canonical state determined by an
Ethereum L1 contract. Based rollups inherit more security by having L1
validators post state root updates instead of a sequencer. Sovereign
rollups have DA somewhere other than Ethereum and have canonical state
determined by consensus.

 PROPER AIRDROP INCENTIVES (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Zeta Markets spent weeks analyzing its users and optimizing the
airdrop to reward long-term participants. It ignored all users with
less than $500 in volume, as they contributed less than 50 cents in
trading fees and are not high-value customers. Active protocols like
exchanges require risk and dedicated participation, weeding out lazy
participants. To prevent instant sell pressure, Zeta Markets
introduced an optional 7-day vesting period that rewarded users with
2x their allocation. 

 VITALIK AND ANATOLY ON SYNCHRONOUS ATOMIC COMPOSABILITY (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Synchronous atomic composability is the concept of L2s instantly and
seamlessly interacting with one another. Vitalik Buterin finds it
overrated, as the main two use cases are cross-chain payments and
using different dapps ‚Äì both of which could be solved with
cross-exchange protocols and wallet integrations. Anatoly Yakovenko,
founder of Solana, sees a global synchronous state as critical for
creating efficient and permissionless markets.

 AGGREGATOR WARS: SOCKET VS LIFI (2 MINUTE READ) [13]

transactions than LIFI. 

 WHY DO SOME CRYPTO NARRATIVES OUTPERFORM (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Certain narratives like AI and real-world assets have performed well
due to unpriced new information which remains underappreciated by the
market, while more established sectors like DEXes and NFTs have not
performed as well because investors recognize their potential. 

 LENS PROTOCOL TO EVENTUALLY LAUNCH ON ZKSYNC (1 MINUTE READ) [15]

protocol with zkSync as its main hub.
