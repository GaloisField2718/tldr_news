 $30 BILLION RIA PLATFORM CARSON GROUP APPROVES TO OFFER SPOT BITCOIN
ETFS TO CLIENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Carson Group, a $30 billion investment advisory platform, is set to
offer four spot Bitcoin ETFs to its clients, greenlighting options
from BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton. It based
its selections on AUM, trading volume, and cost-effectiveness. The
move puts Carson Group at the front of the pack amongst RIAs approving
spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a contrast to firms like Vanguard, which
blocked clients from buying these SEC-approved ETFs. 

 CITIBANK EXPLORES TOKENIZATION OF PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Citibank, in partnership with WisdomTree and Wellington Capital, has
successfully simulated the tokenization of a private equity fund using
blockchain technology. The process proves that tokenization is
possible in a controlled environment, can remain legally compliant,
and is compatible with existing banking systems. The move could
potentially introduce efficiencies into the $6 trillion private equity
industry. The success of this test will inform Citibank's decisions
about offering related services.

 PARCEL TO LAUNCH PRCL TOKEN (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Parcel is set to launch its token PRCL in April, to further
decentralize its ecosystem. Token holders will participate in
governance and have improved data and trading utility. Initially, 7-8%
of the total one billion tokens will be in circulation. PRCL will give
access to high-grade real estate data and future incentive programs.
Eligibility for the initial community airdrop can be verified on
Parcl's website. 

 UNISWAP FOUNDATION PROPOSAL SUGGESTS TURNING ON REWARDS FOR UNI TOKEN
HOLDERS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Uniswap put out a proposal to modify the governance of its DEX,
including adjusting the fee structure to benefit users who delegate
and stake their UNI tokens. The proposal will be put to a vote on
March 1, followed by an on-chain vote on March 8. This was a huge
shift for Uniswap and for governance tokens in general, as very few
tokens actually allow holders to participate in the revenues of the
protocol. Many are speculating that this indicates positive regulatory
progress in the background and could lead to more protocols choosing
to include token holders in fee-sharing mechanisms.

 HOW TO MAKE AN INCOME FLYWHEEL ON PERPETUAL EXCHANGES (11 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This thread explains how to create an income flywheel using perpetual
DEXs. It is possible to go both long and short on two different DEXs,
leveraging the funding rates by emulating the strategy that the newly
launched stablecoin protocol Ethena is implementing. The key is to
pick exchanges that are profitable, offer good tokenomics, and provide
good delta through arbitrage. Currently, Vertex and HMX are the
author‚Äôs top picks owing to their stable income, continuous tech
development, and beneficial tokenomics.

 ZKML - THE NEXT BIG NARRATIVE IN AI (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The combination of Zero Knowledge Proofs with machine learning, known
as ZkML, has the potential to become one of the next big narratives.
ZKPs allow those building machine learning models to conduct
inferences without exposing the data used but still ensuring
computational correctness. They also help tackle privacy concerns like
membership inference attacks and model inversion attacks. ZkML
infrastructure is already being developed by several notable startups
in the space, which could give rise to a hype cycle for this tech.
