'BASELESS' NYAG LAWSUITS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 DCG and its CEO Barry Silbert have sought to dismiss a lawsuit from
New York's Attorney General, Letitia James. The legal action alleges
DCG and its subsidiary Genesis Global Capital defrauded investors

of crypto entities Three Arrows Capital and FTX. The move follows
DCG's opposition to a proposed settlement deal from Genesis with the
NYAG last month.

AFTER SEC LAWSUIT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Binance.US is struggling with a loss of trust, severe revenue

workforce and experienced heightened legal and auditing costs and the
loss of banking relationships.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 BITCOIN ON-CHAIN DEEP DIVE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bitcoin's long-term holder growth rate is indicating early bullrun
signs. A buoyant supply delta and the Bitcoin Macro Index point to
strong expansion. While the trend suggests a significant uptrend in
the coming months, it could be potentially faster than the average
progression and there is a possibility of some short-term volatility
or pullback. The era of "deep value" Bitcoin is over, giving way to a
"Bitcoin Momentum era." 

 ICHIMOKU KINKO HYO: A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo is a comprehensive trading system originally
from Japan that helps traders maintain a holistic view of an asset‚Äôs
trend. The system encompasses six elements. These include the
Kijun-Sen or base line, Tenkan-Sen or conversion line, Chikou Span
(also known as Lagging Span), and Senkou Span A and B, which
collectively form the Cloud (Kumo), a crucial feature of the system.
The system applies to multiple markets, such as crypto, commodities,
forex, and more. Its one-glance approach helps traders identify the
direction and strength of a trend, potential support, and resistance
levels and can provide overbought or oversold signals.

 WHY BITCOIN COULD BE THE BIGGEST ON-CHAIN CASINO IN THE WORLD (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Bitcoin could experience a surge in speculative activity within the
next 6-12 months beyond its typical use case of being a store of
value. There has been a flurry of developer activity on Bitcoin over
the past year, which has led to NFTs, DeFi, and other use cases being
built on top of Bitcoin. Coupled with its familiarity with the retail
audience and the potential for speculators to increase their bitcoin
stack, significant capital flows are predicted for Ordinals, L2s,
DeFi, and other apps during this bull run that will resemble the
Ethereum ecosystem‚Äôs growth in 2020-2021.

network's core protocol, World ID, through this method. Reilabs noted
the need for better tools in order to ensure ZK proof correctness and
advocates for continuous checks to prevent user access issues.
