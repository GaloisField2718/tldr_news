 STABLECOIN WARS HEAT UP AS CIRCLE ASKS CONGRESS TO REIN IN TETHER (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Circle and Coinbase are asking Congress to give the Treasury more
authority to scrutinize the issuers of Tether, the leading stablecoin
issuer, and its banking partner. The executives are accusing Tether of
enabling illicit activities and promoting its own USD-backed
cryptocurrencies as more compliant alternatives. Tether leads the
stablecoin industry by a wide margin, but the competition between
Circle and Tether has been intense over the past couple of years. 

 CRYPTO VENTURE FUNDING CLIMBS FOR FIRST TIME IN NEARLY 2 YEARS AFTER
BITCOIN‚ÄôS STELLAR RUN (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Crypto venture funding totaled $1.9 billion in Q4, a 2.5% increase
from the previous quarter. This uptick comes as the prices of tokens
in the crypto market and prices of crypto equities appreciated
significantly starting in Q4. The quarter also included several large
funding rounds for established companies like Swan Bitcoin,
Blockchain.com, and Wormhole.

 APECOIN DAO CHOOSES ARBITRUM TO HOST APECHAIN (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The DAO behind ApeCoin has voted to build its gaming-focused ApeChain
on Arbitrum, a popular Ethereum scaling solution. The decision has led
to a modest rally in APE's price, a slight reversal from the fairly
consistent decline it has had since its launch two years ago. However,
the decision sparked controversy as the top voter was Horizen Labs,
the team that developed the staking mechanism for APE coin that
disappointed many in the community. Horizen was also the author of the
proposal and would be working on ApeChain, so some community members
are accusing them of self-dealing. 

 WORMHOLE FOUNDATION COLLABORATES WITH SUCCINCT ON 'ZK LIGHT CLIENT'
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Wormhole is partnering with Succinct to build an Ethereum ZK Light
Client to support message verification on the Wormhole platform. This
will minimize reliance on Wormhole Guardians for multi-chain message
verification. Succinct's unified ZKP protocol will simplify the
development process and enable easy integration for the latest proof
systems.

 GUIDE TO EARLY ORDINALS COLLECTIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread discusses the debate over the first-ever Ordinals
Collection - BitcoinShrooms, OrdinalPunks, or OrdRocks. The debate
hinges on how you would define a collection - whether the collection
needs to be grouped together by inscription numbers and whether it
needs to be a profile picture collection or not. BitcoinShrooms was
staggered in its inscriptions, with a group of them starting at
inscription #19. OrdinalPunks is credited as the first PFP collection.
OrdRocks has the lowest overall inscription numbers. 

 HOW TO BRIBE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This thread articulates a strategy to effectively use sniping bots by
‚Äòbribing‚Äô to get your trades to be executed first. Key elements of
this method include selecting the right sniping bot, correctly setting
up features, and determining the optimal incentive to increase the
chances of getting the first trade. It isn‚Äôt just enough to know how
much to bribe - traders also need to try to get a good idea of what
the demand for the token will be to see if it is even worth paying the
bribe.

 This post discusses opportunities that the crypto space has given
participants in the past and anticipates that there will be
opportunities on a similar scale for another couple of cycles. While
returns on BTC and ETH have likely diminished, other coins can still
provide significant returns. The coming bubble is likely to burst
around 2025-2026 - participants need to remember to take profits. 

 MOONBIRDS IS JOINING BORED APE‚ÄôS NFT EMPIRE, BUT CAN YUGA LABS
CONQUER ITS GROWING PAINS? (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Yuga Labs, the team behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club, has announced
the acquisition of Proof, the NFT company behind the Proof Collective
and Moonbirds. Proof has faced significant challenges over the past
year and a half after a booming start. The Moonbirds assets will be
integrated into Yuga's gaming universe, with potential for IP rights
transfers to holders. The deal was met with polarized opinions. Many
in the BAYC community have been disappointed with the team throughout
the bear market.
