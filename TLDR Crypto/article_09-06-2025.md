MARKETS & BUSINESS

 GEMINI CONFIDENTIALLY FILES FOR IPO (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Gemini, the Winklevoss twins' crypto exchange and custodian, has
confidentially filed for an IPO, allowing it to test investor demand
without immediate disclosure of its financials. The filing comes after
the SEC closed its investigation without enforcement and following a
$5 million CFTC settlement, marking a cleaner regulatory slate. By
going public under the Trump administration's more favorable crypto
stance, Gemini joins peers like Circle and Galaxy Digital in
leveraging public markets. The company appointed former Affirm
executive Dan Chen as CFO earlier this year to steer its next growth
phase ahead of a formal listing once the SEC review is complete. 

 POLYMARKET BECOMES OFFICIAL PREDICTION MARKET OF X (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Polymarket has been named the official prediction market partner of
X, rolling out a real-time insights tool that fuses X-sourced news,
Polymarket event contracts, and xAI's Grok chatbot to explain
market-moving developments. The initial integration will surface live
predictions alongside contextual data from relevant X posts, with
further “unique experiences” slated under their agreement. Crypto
enthusiasts are excited for the potential of the partnership to expand
to placing predictions, which would imply every X user getting a
crypto wallet.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 COINBASE UNLOCKS DEFI FOR XRP AND DOGECOIN HOLDERS ON BASE (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Coinbase has launched wrapped XRP (cbXRP) and wrapped Dogecoin
(cbDOGE) on its Base Layer-2, each backed 1:1 by native coins held in
Coinbase custody, enabling holders to access DeFi protocols and
yield-generating opportunities. These wrapped tokens facilitate
interoperability within the Base ecosystem, allowing users to transfer
and deploy their XRP and DOGE in decentralized applications. In the
first 24 hours, cbXRP's market cap surpassed $5 million and cbDOGE
neared $2 million, underscoring strong initial demand. 

 PUMP.FUN WILL DISTRIBUTE PROTOCOL REVENUE TO TOKEN HOLDERS (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Pump.fun is preparing a PUMP token ICO targeting a $1 billion raise
at a $4 billion valuation, complete with a “buyback-powered”
revenue-sharing model that allocates a portion of the protocol's
profits to token holders and an upcoming airdrop. The Solana-based
launchpad, which has generated roughly $677 million in cumulative
revenue, will set supply at 1 trillion tokens, price the public sale
at $0.004 per token, and reserve 10% for the airdrop. All tokens sold
in the public and private rounds will fully unlock at the
token-generation event, with additional issuances possible but total
supply fixed. This token launch is designed to reward early users and
reignite platform activity.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 LESSONS ABOUT AMMS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Liquidity providers in AMMs face a delicate balance where trading
fees must outpace losses from price movements, or no amount of volume
can make them profitable. Simple, static-fee models and overly
concentrated or complex designs often underperform robust,
battle-tested AMMs like Uniswap V2, which benefit from passive, ERC-20
liquidity and winner-takes-all network effects. Dynamic fee
structures, good trade aggregation, and seamless UIs can improve
profitability, but small tweaks that reduce losses or boost fees have
outsized impacts on net returns. Ultimately, LPs crave simplicity and
transparency and avoid overly bespoke code, reliance on oracles, or
leveraged concentration that magnifies risk. 

 TRADING FRAMEWORK CHEAT SHEET (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Use exponential moving averages (EMAs -21, 55, and 200) to gauge
momentum and trend direction across timeframes. Lean on Volume
Profile, VAH/VAL (value area high and value area low), and anchored
VWAP (volume weighted average price) for key price zones and trend
signals. Always separate low and high-timeframe analysis, focus on
candle closes for clarity, and use tools like Auction Market Theory
and AI for sharper insights.

 SKEPTICISM AROUND STABLECOIN UTILITY IN G10 FX (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Stablecoins may not improve FX efficiency in G10 corridors where
costs are already near-zero and real-time, making traditional rails
hard to beat. However, in high-friction markets, they offer dollar
access, faster settlement, and programmable infrastructure where
banking gaps or regulatory hurdles still limit financial inclusion. 

 YIELD-BEARING STABLECOINS TOP $7.19B AS SUSDE AND SUSDS DOMINATE
LIQUIDITY (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 SUSDE and sUSDS now control 77% of the $7.19B yield-bearing
stablecoin market, paying out over $360M in yield to date. With APYs
up to 15%, RWAs like USDY and USDO offer safer alternatives, but smart
contract risk and rate compression remain key concerns.

 STABLECOIN'S VALUE PROP (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Stablecoins are analogous to Real-Time-Payment rails, which offer
instant settlement via central banks. 

 AAVE TVL 50% GREATER THAN REVOLUT'S (1 MINUTE READ) [13]

 ETH AND RWA MARKET CAP CORRELATION (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This chart shows that Ethereum's fully diluted market cap has
consistently stayed above the total value locked (TVL) on the network,
including stablecoins, RWAs, and other hosted assets. 

 POST-STABLECOIN REMITTANCES CUT OUT CASH (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Stablecoins reduce remittance costs by removing the need to off-ramp
into local currencies, allowing users to receive, save, and sometimes
spend in dollars directly. 

 TRADFI GIANTS CONTINUE TO SCALE ONCHAIN (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 BlackRock, PayPal, WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, Apollo, and others
have collectively driven tokenized assets under management on
Ethereum.
