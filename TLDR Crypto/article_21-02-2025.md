MARKETS & BUSINESS

 EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK EXPLORES USING DIGITAL LEDGERS TO SETTLE
TRANSACTIONS IN CENTRAL BANK MONEY (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The European Central Bank (ECB) is exploring a digital ledger-based
settlement system for central bank money, aiming to improve financial
market efficiency while maintaining stability. This initiative
includes a two-track plan: developing a settlement platform and
enabling central bank money use in digital asset transactions,
especially for foreign exchange and cross-border payments. 

 TRADFI INVESTORS PILED $38.7B INTO BITCOIN ETFS, THREE TIMES MORE
THAN PREVIOUS QUARTER (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Institutional investors increased their spot Bitcoin ETF holdings to
$38.7B in Q4 2024, more than triple the $12.4 billion reported in Q3,
according to SEC filings. Major entities like Wisconsin's investment
board and Paul Tudor Jones' hedge fund expanded their positions to
tens of millions of dollars of BTC. BlackRock's IBIT has attracted
around 1,100 institutional holders since its release in January 2024
– by this time, most ETFs have fewer than 10 institutions invested.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING SOLANA SMART WALLETS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Crossmint has introduced Solana Smart Wallets, a new generation of
programmable, gasless wallets designed for mass adoption. These
wallets enhance user experience and security by eliminating
transaction approval prompts, supporting multiple authentication
methods, and integrating seamlessly with AI, gaming, and financial
applications. 

 SHADE AGENTS: THE FIRST TRULY AUTONOMOUS AI AGENTS (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 NEAR Protocol has launched Shade Agents, a new framework for creating
autonomous agents that can execute transactions across multiple
chains. They use trusted execution environments and Chain Signatures
for decentralized key management and chain abstraction. The system
combines on-chain smart contracts with off-chain worker agents that
can interact with AI models and external data sources, while
maintaining security through a decentralized network of TEE-verified
workers rather than relying on single points of failure. This
infrastructure enables various applications including automated
trading, decentralized solving, and AI-driven asset management.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 IMPLICATIONS OF KAITO TOKEN RELEASE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI-powered information analytics company Kaito released their token
at a $1B+ valuation, breaking from the traditional venture capital
path typically followed by offchain entities like research and data
companies. With challenging market conditions making raising from
venture capital more difficult, a token launch is an attractive
alternative to traditional equity fundraising. This precedent could
trigger a broader trend of centralized crypto companies opting for
token launches over venture capital rounds, potentially accelerating
the movement toward tokenization of traditional equity structures. 

 HOW AI HAS CHANGED STARTUPS FOREVER (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI has dramatically increased startup productivity, reducing costs
across software development, marketing, and operations, with coding
efficiency skyrocketing from 1.5x to 4x in just three years. As
startups require less funding and fewer employees to scale,
defensibility will rely on proprietary data, network effects, deep
integrations, and trust rather than just software alone.

 ARGENTINA ETHEREUM COMMUNITY (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Argentina's Ethereum community has already made big contributions to
the ecosystem, and its builders are determined to use crypto for
long-term societal progress. Vitalik Buterin believes hosting
Devconnect in Argentina could highlight the region's potential while
fostering education, adoption, and lasting impact in the Ethereum
space. 

 BRIAN ARMSTRONG ON MEMECOINS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, acknowledges the potential and staying
power of memecoins, going so far as to suggest Bitcoin and the US
Dollar are in some sense memecoins. Coinbase wants to be the place
where anyone can buy any memecoin, and not be opinionated about what's
listed as long as it is regulatory compliant. He recommends removing
bad actors from the space and calling out their illegal insider
trading activities while using memecoins as one of many mechanisms to
bring a billion users onchain.
