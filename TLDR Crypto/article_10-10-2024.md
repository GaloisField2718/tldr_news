 MANGO DAO FAILS TO PASS PROPOSAL TO APPROVE SEC SETTLEMENT (1 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 In a sad example of DAO voter apathy and a lack of incentives, the
Mango DAO could not accrue votes from a mere 2% of token holders to
accept its lawsuit settlement with the SEC. Though the proposal was
passing, one large voter withdrew their vote with four hours
remaining. Had the vote passed, the DAO would have paid the SEC
$670,000 and ceased interactions with MNGO in the United States. 

 WHO IS PETER TODD, AND WHY DOES HBO THINK HE IS SATOSHI? (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 HBO's documentary Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery suggests Peter
Todd, a prominent Bitcoin developer, as a potential candidate for
Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, citing circumstantial
evidence like a mistaken forum post reply and shared communication
patterns. However, the crypto community has largely dismissed these
claims as speculative and unsupported, with Todd himself denying being
Satoshi.

 VANECK LAUNCHES $30M FUND TO SUPPORT INNOVATION IN FINTECH, CRYPTO,
AND AI (3 MINUTE READ) [6]

infrastructure rather than value-driven products. It is introducing a
$30M early-stage fund dedicated to building innovation at the
intersection of fintech, crypto, and AI. This initiative aims to
support founders who are defining the application layers in their
markets, emphasizing tokenized assets, marketplaces, and on-chain

 AZTEC'S ROAD TO MAINNET (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After seven years of public development, the privacy-focused Aztec L2
has finally released its road to mainnet with an interactive roadmap.
It is similar in structure to Ethereum's roadmap, with several
categories like programmable privacy, decentralization, and proving
system with several steps in each ultimately leading to the mainnet
launch. As one of the original privacy projects, Aztec enables private
smart contracts and interactions through its Noir programming language
and zero-knowledge proofs.

 GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS, US JOBS REPORT, BASE GROWTH, AND RESTAKING
TRENDS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The crypto market saw major fluctuations last week, with Bitcoin
dropping to $60,000 before rebounding to $62,000 due to geopolitical
tensions between Israel and Iran and a strong U.S. jobs report. Base,
an Ethereum Layer 2 network, reached $2 billion in total value locked
(TVL), driven by the success of Aerodrome, while Ethereum's liquid
restaking protocols saw explosive growth, with TVL surging from
112,000 ETH to 3.5 million ETH in 2024. 

 APPLICATIONS CAPTURE FEES, BLOCKCHAINS STORE VALUE (9 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Blockchain-based applications like pump.fun are increasingly
out-earning infrastructure and smart contract platforms. There has
been a shift toward “fat applications” and modularization across
blockchains as apps seek greater economic control and technical
flexibility. While apps capture a larger share of the blockchain fee
pool, L1s could compete as digital money, acting as a store of value
and medium of exchange.

 DEFI AS THE TRADFI LIQUIDITY LAYER (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DeFi might pay TradFi for asset flow, like how startups pay Google
for search result ranking. Since TradFi owns distribution, they can
integrate with existing DeFi protocols and incentivize the movement of
assets to their platforms for custody, insurance, and other benefits. 

 PROTOCOL VALUE ACCRUAL BLACK PILL (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Blockchains face complex challenges in value accrual and must balance
revenue from transaction fees, MEV, and token emissions while
navigating the trade-off of higher per-transaction value or maximum
volume capacity. Appchains and application-specific sequencing could
internalize priority fees and MEV for apps, potentially reducing
protocol revenue. With enough misalignment between protocols and apps,
there could be a shift in value accrual from protocols to the apps,
forcing protocols to rely on high transaction volumes rather than
individual transaction value.
