 COINBASE AND THE SEC ARGUE CRYPTO'S KEY LEGAL QUESTION IN COURT (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Coinbase is currently in its long-awaited court showdown with the SEC
over whether most crypto assets should be considered securities in the
US. The SEC has been arguing that people buy these assets expecting
prices to go up based on the success of the creators, which could
classify the assets as securities. However, Coinbase is arguing that
buyers do not have the right to take action against issuers if the
digital assets perform poorly, so there's no investment contract. They
are also arguing that the SEC‚Äôs stance is overly broad and would
even include assets like baseball cards and other collectibles. 

 SPOT BITCOIN ETF ISSUER VANECK TO SHUTTER BTC FUTURES FUND (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 VanEck has announced plans to cease trading of its Bitcoin Strategy
ETF due to several considerations, including its performance and
investor appetite for it. The ETF, launched in November 2021, has
approximately $53 million in assets but is now being overshadowed by
the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF which has over $2 billion in assets
as an alternative. Other financial institutions like Ark Invest,
21Shares, and Bitwise are still offering their Bitcoin futures ETFs.

 ALTLAYER‚ÄôS ALT TOKEN LAUNCH (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AltLayer, an open, decentralized protocol for rollups, is launching
its ALT token. The protocol provides enhanced security,
decentralization, interoperability, and crypto-economic fast finality
for existing rollups. It has collaborated with infrastructure teams in
the Ethereum ecosystem and is being used by several projects across
gaming and DeFi. The ALT token will launch via Binance Launchpool on
January 25 and will be used for economic stake, governance, protocol
incentivization, and fees.

 WHY TIA IS GOING TO BE THIS CYCLE'S (3,3) (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This thread breaks down how TIA could be this cycle‚Äôs (3,3), a meme
that took hold with OHM causing the token price to skyrocket. The
author posits that Celestia, which helps projects deploy new rollups
and blockchains more cheaply and easily by significantly reducing the
cost to post data to the chain, is a major technological leap. In
addition to the promising tech, the surge in TIA‚Äôs price is partly
linked to an increasing number of airdrops allocated to TIA stakers.
This could eventually cause TIA‚Äôs price to enter bubble territory
and encourages readers to remain cautious about this dynamic. 

 ELECTRIC CAPITAL‚ÄôS 2023 CRYPTO DEVELOPER REPORT (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 The 5th annual Electric Capital Developer Report, which analyzed a
record 485 million code commits across 818,000 repositories, is
finally out. At a high level, the number of developers in the crypto
space has declined by 24%. However, the majority of this decline can
be attributed to newer developers leaving the space, as the
experienced developer group continued to show growth. The report is
comprehensive and covers not only this high-level data, but also
breaks down developer activity by chain and many other metrics.
