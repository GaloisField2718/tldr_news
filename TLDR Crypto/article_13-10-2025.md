MARKETS & BUSINESS

 SOLANA'S TREASURY BOOM RAISES VALUATION CONCERNS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Solana Foundation has sold discounted SOL to several public firms
creating token-based treasuries, fueling ecosystem growth but raising
questions about oversaturation. Over a dozen “Solana DATs”,
including Sharps Technology, Solmate, and Forward Industries, now hold
hundreds of millions in SOL. Supporters see more buyers as healthy for
Solana's visibility, while critics warn that too many discounted deals
could pressure valuations and weaken existing treasuries' multiples. 

 BINANCE PAYS $283M TO COVER USER LOSSES AFTER DEPEG EVENT (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Binance has compensated users $283 million following Friday's crypto
crash, which saw three Binance Earn assets, USDe, BNSOL, and WBETH,
depeg sharply on the exchange. Binance said affected futures, margin,
and loan users were reimbursed, and emphasized that the market crash
preceded the depegs, not vice versa.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 ERC-8004: TRUSTLESS AGENTS V1 SPEC LAUNCHES (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ERC-8004 v1 is a standard that allows AI agents to discover and trust
each other without central intermediaries by representing agents as
NFTs that can be minted, transferred, and managed using existing
ERC-721 infrastructure while pointing to registration files listing
names, skills, capabilities, and endpoints for portability across any
agent explorer. The standard provides logically centralized
permissionless discovery with onchain reputation through scores and
custom tags stored via events and optional IPFS feedback, support for
MCP prompt/resource/tool discovery and review, x402 payment proof
integration for value-weighted reputation signals, and a Validations
Registry for TEE oracles, stake-secured inference, and zkML
verification. Developer experience improvements include gasless
feedback flows through ERC-7702 where clients don't need to register
for sign-and-relay submissions, straightforward subgraph indexing by
blending onchain data with IPFS resources, and community-built SDKs
coming soon with testnet deployment next week. 

 KOHAKU: ETHEREUM'S PRIVACY AND SECURITY TOOLKIT (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Kohaku is an open-source SDK and reference wallet led by Nicolas
Consigny and Vitalik Buterin focused on privacy and security
improvements for Ethereum wallets that will enable future wallets to
run "mini Ethereum" inside browsers through Helios lightclient to
verify blockchain state without trusting centralized RPC servers. The
toolkit targets power users with features including private
sends/receives through protocols like Railgun, one unique account per
dApp to prevent tracking across applications, peer-to-peer wallet-app
communication instead of public servers, private state reading via
oblivious servers with TEE+ORAM, post-quantum killswitch with
Falcon/Dilithium verifiers, and spending policy limits to prevent
phishing and overdegen mistakes. The project represents collaboration
among Ethereum's leading privacy teams, including Ambire, Wonderland,
Railgun, Helios, PSE, Oblivious Labs, and individual researchers like
Micah Zoltu, with a first demo focusing on privacy features at Devcon
and future directions exploring native Ethereum browsers for deeper
security, local AI transaction scoring, privacy-preserving account
abstraction, and native account abstraction implementation over 2026.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 MARKET CRASH BREAKDOWN (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hyperliquid alone saw open interest crash from $15 billion to $6
billion in one day during a liquidation cascade reminiscent of May
2021, where months of low volatility and steady run-up led traders to
accumulate excessive risk chasing returns in a macro environment with
gold at $4,000 and stocks breaking all-time highs daily. The fragility
was hidden beneath liquidity abundance, where every token launch faced
hot money and FOMO retail, masking risks including synthetic dollar
collateral, premarket perpetuals without external funding references,
and perp DEX valuations disconnected from actual liquidity depth. 

 BLACK FRIDAY: WHAT HAPPENED? (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Mysterious traders opened massive short positions on Hyperliquid 30
minutes before Trump's 100% China tariff announcement on October 10,
profiting $192 million as BTC crashed from $117k to $104k in 20
minutes while altcoins suffered catastrophic losses with ATOM nearly
going to zero, Ethena dropping 80%, and SOL falling 40%. Open interest
cratered over 50% across the board from $67 billion to $33 billion for
BTC, $38 billion to $19 billion for ETH, and $43 billion to $31
billion for alts, forcing exchanges to deploy Auto-DeLeveraging that
closed profitable short positions to fill liquidation holes with
Lighter being the only major exchange avoiding ADL though experiencing
multi-hour outages. DeFi protocols processed record liquidations,
including AAVE's $180 million and Morpho's ~$100 million without bad
debt, while USDe depegged to $0.62, USDT spiked to 1.006 premium, and
onchain prices disconnected from reality with Rabby and DeBank
stopping transactions for tens of thousands while some users received
absurd fills on BNB and wETH through Cowswap at prices unavailable on
CEXs.

 DEBASEMENT OR MOMENTUM? (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Solana spot ETF approval looks increasingly likely as SEC's generic
listing standards shorten timelines from 270 to 75 days, with
Bloomberg Intelligence assigning near 100% approval odds, while
improving onchain liquidity and CEX outflows support constructive
positioning, though elevated leverage creates vulnerability to
headline or macro disappointments. Ethereum shows mixed signals with
validator queues reaching record levels from both exits and new
entries driven primarily by Grayscale enabling staking in US spot ETH
funds, suggesting two-way institutional routing rather than one-way
de-risking, though growing institutional staking bases create systemic
exit-queue risks during liquidation cascades. The debasement trade
remains a long-term trend requiring new capital market assumptions
rather than a short-term opportunity, with the US government shutdown
entering its tenth day raising debt concerns but likely conflating
momentum trades with genuine de-dollarization positioning as bearish
USD consensus builds. 

 THE ENDGAME FOR STABLECOINS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A future with 1,000 stablecoins will resemble today's banking system,
where users treat dollars from different banks as interchangeable
because clearing networks like ACH, Fedwire, Visa, and Mastercard
reconcile private monies behind the scenes. Stablecoin fungibility
won't come from regulation like the GENIUS Act, but from onchain
interoperability layers that abstract issuers away. Projects like M0,
Paxos, and Anchorage show intra-issuer interop, while Ubyx is testing
cross-issuer clearing. Once users can transact seamlessly across
stablecoins, the issuer fades into the background.

 HYPERLIQUID WHALE REOPENS $160M SHORT AFTER $150M PROFIT (2 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 A Hyperliquid trader who earned $150 million shorting BTC and ETH
before Friday's tariff-induced crash has opened a new $160 million
short, using $16 million in collateral at 10x leverage. 

 NUBANK APPLIES FOR US BANKING CHARTER (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Latin America's largest neobank, Nubank ($NU), has applied for a US
banking charter, signaling its first major expansion beyond the
region. 

 DEFI BARELY AVOIDED A BLACK SWAN (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Friday's $19B liquidation wave nearly became DeFi's worst crisis, as
isolated mispricings on centralized venues, like USDe at $0.65 and
PAXG at $3,600, threatened to spill into onchain lending markets such
as Aave, where $4.8B in positions were at risk.
