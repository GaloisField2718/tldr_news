WINKLEVOSS'S GEMINI GEARS UP TO LAUNCH OVERSEAS CRYPTO DERIVATIVES
EXCHANGE - REPORT (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://seekingalpha.com/news/3952431-winklevosss-gemini-gears-up-to-launch-overseas-crypto-derivatives-exchange-report?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange led by the Winklevoss twins, is
reportedly working with market makers to introduce overseas crypto
derivatives. This move follows increased attention on international
crypto derivatives exchanges after the US CFTC's lawsuit against
Binance. Gemini's actions come amid FTX's downfall, opening
opportunities for trading platforms to expand into derivatives
trading. Coinbase Global is also said to be exploring a similar path.
Recently, Gemini faced challenges such as a lawsuit with the SEC and
industry-wide downturn-related job cuts. 

SEC'S GENSLER INSISTS CLEAR RULES FOR CRYPTO MARKET 'ALREADY EXIST' (3
MINUTE READ)
[https://decrypt.co/124872/sec-gensler-insists-clear-rules-crypto-already-exist?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


In a testimony yesterday, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler continued to claim
that there are clear regulations for crypto companies, but that they
are just not complying. He also reiterated that the majority of coins
and tokens are securities. Gensler maintained that regulations,
including disclosure regulations, are already in place, while most
industry participants and outsiders seem to have a less than clear
understanding of those ‚Äúregulations‚Äù. The SEC continues to follow
a "regulation by enforcement" approach, cracking down on companies and
projects dealing with unregistered securities. High-profile crypto
brands have faced increased scrutiny from the SEC, resulting in fines
and legal actions.

ART BLOCKS DEBUTS NFT MARKETPLACE WITH ENFORCED CREATOR ROYALTIES (6
MINUTE READ)
[https://decrypt.co/124848/art-blocks-nft-marketplace-enforced-creator-royalties?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Art Blocks has introduced its own secondary marketplace for NFTs,
integrated within the existing website, which allows collectors to
browse NFTs across all Art Blocks collections. The company will not
charge platform fees for secondary trades and will honor artists'
royalty settings. This move contrasts with other Ethereum NFT
marketplaces, such as OpenSea, which have made creator royalties
optional. Art Blocks is one of the largest players in the NFT
ecosystem generating over $1.4 billion in sales while focusing on
spotlighting projects and providing a secure platform. 

AN OP STACK THAT TURNS AN IPHONE INTO A HARDWARE WALLET WITH FULL
ACCOUNT ABSTRACTION SUPPORT (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1640062610161688577.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This thread gives an overview of Opclave, an Op Stack chain that turns
iPhones into hardware wallets with full Account Abstraction support.
Opclave uses Apple's Secure Enclave for private key storage, enhancing
mobile wallet security. Despite differences in supported curves,
Opclave implements a precompile verifier for secp256r1, improving user
experience with features like Paymasters, Social Recovery, and daily
spend limits. The Opclave team has released a PoC demo video and
open-sourced their code, hoping to develop the project further and
bring it to the mainnet.

THE NFT MEV LANDSCAPE (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://frontier.tech/the-nft-mev-landscape?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

The NFT market's structure differs significantly from that of fungible
tokens, featuring more frequent capital formation events, lower
secondary volumes, bid liquidity challenges, and numerous offchain
orderbooks. This results in a unique NFT MEV landscape with fewer
arbitrage opportunities and more MEV extraction during mints. Unique
MEV forms in the NFT market include sweeping and re-listing floors,
trait sniping, and extraction from inactive listings. Opportunities to
address these challenges include MEV-aware minting solutions, open
pricing data, dynamic on-chain orderbooks, new auction styles, and
additional communication channels for traders. 

BEAR IN MIND: LONG-TERM BUILDER‚ÄôS GUIDE TO THE BEAR MARKET (4 MINUTE
READ)
[https://safe.mirror.xyz/bbGiyuFzdvkQzYqdx2ut34gDpnuTuC3R8kMn-Dh7RPQ?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


The bear market presents Web3 projects with both challenges and
opportunities. Key hurdles include reduced funding, market slowdown,
project failures, and regulatory pressure. However, opportunities for
long-term builders involve hiring, investment, infrastructure focus,
and superior product traction. To navigate this environment, projects
should be frugal, prioritize long-term commitment, hire cautiously,
concentrate on tokenomics, set clear objectives, and prepare for the
next market uptrend.

SAM BANKMAN-FRIED‚ÄôS LEGAL DEFENSE IS BEING FUNDED WITH ALAMEDA MONEY
HE GIFTED HIS FATHER (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2023/03/29/sam-bankman-fried-legal-fees-funded-by-alameda-money-gifted-to-father-joe-bankman/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the collapsed FTX exchange, is
allegedly funding his legal defense with a multi-million dollar gift
originally given to his father, financed by a loan from SBF-owned
Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried faces charges including wire fraud,
money laundering, and securities fraud. The gift, given tax-free using
a lifetime estate and gift tax exemption, was arranged in 2021. FTX
debtors allege $8.9 billion in customer deposits are still missing,
with Bankman-Fried accused of misappropriating customer funds via
Alameda since 2019. 

ETHEREUM STAKING TOKENS JUMP DOUBLE DIGITS AS SHANGHAI UPGRADE GETS A
DATE (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://decrypt.co/124812/ethereum-staking-tokens-shanghai-upgrade-gets-date?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


The upcoming Shapella upgrade that will allow Ethereum stakers to
freely withdraw their ETH was announced for April 12, giving a boost
to staking project tokens like LDO, FXS, and RPL. With withdrawals
enabled, the decreased risk could attract more ETH holders to stake
through liquid staking derivative platforms in pursuit of higher
yields. This upgrade follows Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake
consensus mechanism in September 2022.
