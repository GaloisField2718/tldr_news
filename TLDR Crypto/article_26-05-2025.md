MARKETS & BUSINESS

 CRYPTO BULLS LOSE $500M AS BITCOIN HOVERS AROUND $108K (4 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Over $500 million in bullish crypto positions were liquidated in 24
hours after President Trump's announcement of proposing tariffs on EU
imports and iPhones. Bitcoin dropped from above $111,000 to around
$108,000, with the selloff triggering roughly $181 million in Bitcoin
futures losses and $142 million in Ether futures, with altcoins like
Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP adding another $100 million in liquidations.
The single largest wipeout was a $9.53 million BTC-USDT swap on OKX.
With trade-war fears rekindling broader macro uncertainty, traders may
remain on edge despite recent ETF inflows and institutional interest. 

 CRYPTO INVESTOR CHARGED IN KIDNAP OF ITALIAN INVESTOR (4 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 John Woeltz and a 24-year-old accomplice were arrested in Lower
Manhattan after an Italian tourist escaped two weeks of captivity and
torture in a SoHo apartment, where Woeltz sought access to the
victim's financial and crypto accounts. Police found Polaroids
documenting the abuse and a firearm at the scene. Woeltz has been
charged with kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, assault, and weapon
possession, while his accomplice faces kidnapping and imprisonment
counts. Woeltz, an early Bitcoin adopter and former developer for
privacy coins HCash and Grin, was held without bail pending trial.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 WEB3 APP STORE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Web3 App Store aggregates several dapps within one tab, allowing
users to seamlessly interact without connecting their wallet for each
interaction. It implements signature and calldata verification for
improved security guarantees, and allows users to configure usable
dapps. Transactions are simulated before execution using Tenderly's
engine. 

 INTRODUCING CRACK.FUN: OUTSMART AI → WIN MONEY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Crack.fun rewards users for prompt engineering and breaking security
measures for AI models. The $CRACK token can unlock winning prompts,
access PVP mode, and reward participants beyond a one-time SOL prize.
It was launched on the Believe platform, which has become increasingly
popular for its role in the nascent “internet capital markets”
narrative.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 WEB3 SOCIAL GRAPHS THESIS (35 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 User-owned, portable web3 social graphs break platform lock-in by
storing follows, likes, and identities on open networks, enabling
developers to build without deplatforming risk and supporting in-app
microtransactions like minting and tipping. Decentralized graphs
introduce new primitives like NFT collections as social expressions
and DAO-based governance, transforming passive feeds into economic
ecosystems. That being said, early protocols like Farcaster and Lens
face cold-start challenges, flagship client dominance, and limited
mainstream traction. The next wave will be driven by compelling,
app-first consumer experiences that leverage token incentives to
bootstrap network effects, coupled with robust go-to-market and
developer ecosystem strategies. 

 PENDLE YIELD TOKEN GUIDE (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Pendle traders can exploit tradable yield tokens (YTs) by placing
maker limit orders when implied YT yields dip below underlying yields,
earning free points and yield without taker fees. Success hinges on
verifying healthy liquidity, analyzing order books and charts to
pinpoint entry and exit thresholds, and exercising patience to execute
the plan. Traders source alpha from project announcements, influential
KOLs, and tips from the Pendle accounts.

 FROM ANCIENT ROME TO MODERN CRYPTO (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Julius Caesar's meteoric ascent hinged on massive, debt-fueled
gambles, like conquering Gaul and crossing the Rubicon, only to meet
his downfall through unchecked leverage. Octavian then borrowed
strategically to achieve clear objectives before shifting to
conservative governance, securing four decades of stable rule. In
crypto, Do Kwon and Sam Bankman-Fried similarly crashed under
perpetual leverage, whereas Changpeng Zhao's calibrated growth
absorbed regulatory shocks. Leveraging with defined goals and timely
de-risking transforms high-stakes opportunities into sustainable
success. 

 VIRTUALS GENESIS LAUNCHES: HOW TO PLAY THIS AGENT META (12 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Virtuals Genesis introduces a point‑based launchpad meta where
participants farm “Virgen Points” by staking $VIRTUAL, locking
ecosystem tokens, or contributing via social “yaps” to gain
allocations in new AI agent token launches. Early, strategic farmers
can compound yields through staking loops, but face timing risks and
cooldown penalties if they exit Genesis rewards too soon.
Alternatively, traders can hold $VIRTUAL to benefit from rising
ecosystem activity or selectively trade individual agent tokens with
proven products and traction.
