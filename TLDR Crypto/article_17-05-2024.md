 U.S. SENATE VOTES TO KILL SEC'S CRYPTO ACCOUNTING POLICY, TESTING
BIDEN'S VETO THREAT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Senate has joined the House of Representatives in overturning the
SEC's SAB 121 in a 60-38 vote. SAB 121 requires crypto custodians to
hold customer assets on their balance sheet, which has significant
consequences and makes the process much more complex. President Biden
previously warned that he would veto this resolution if it passed in
Congress, stating that he would side with Gensler and the SEC. The
vote passed with support of most Republicans and 12 Democrats. 

 CME LOOKS TO TAKE ON BINANCE AND COINBASE, COULD LAUNCH SPOT BITCOIN
TRADING (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Chicago Mercantile Exchange intends to offer spot Bitcoin trading
to its clients as demand for the product increases. As a global
derivatives powerhouse, it hosts the top Bitcoin futures exchange by
open interest, while Binance leads in spot trading volume. A spot
market would allow for complex spot and futures strategies to be
executed in the same place.

 CHAINLINK TOKENIZATION TEST (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chainlink recently shared the results of the Smart NAV (Net Asset
Value) industry pilot, which involved Chainlink, DTCC, and ten major
financial institutions. In the pilot, the team successfully delivered
mutual fund data onchain, which demonstrated DTCC's capability to
provide NAV data across various blockchains (private/public). This
pilot illustrates how Chainlink's CCIP can be used as an open
blockchain interoperability standard to prevent fragmentation and
improve automated data dissemination and access for fund tokenization.


 VEDA: THE FIRST NATIVE YIELD LAYER (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 DeFi is a complex user experience, with various chains and protocols
that become overwhelming for new users. Veda is creating the
‚Äúbedrock of an entire yield ecosystem‚Äù with black box yield
optimization, a modular architecture, and secure cross-chain
communication. It takes the concept of native yield popularized by
Blast and Ethena and extends it to any protocol and DeFi product.

 RECONCILING THE TWO OPPOSING PATHS FOR DECENTRALIZED STABLECOINS (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Maker's DAI stablecoin has been in an awkward position, unable to
commit fully to the idea of being a completely decentralized
stablecoin or a large-scale, dollar-pegged asset. Maker's Endgame
allows these visions to be pursued simultaneously, with DAI being
replaced by two stablecoins: NewStable and PureDai. NewStable will
focus on utility and adoption, emphasizing decentralization but
incorporating RWA and TradFi. PureDai will be collateralized by
decentralized assets like ETH, with a free-floating peg, maximally
decentralized oracles, and no governance. 

 DEEP DIVE INTO TON ECOSYSTEM (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 TON, founded by the Durov brothers in 2017 and rebranded to "The Open
Network" in 2020, has seen a resurgence since its collaboration with
Telegram in September 2023. It is now the 9th largest crypto project
with a current FDV of ~$25B. TON's ecosystem includes the TON
Blockchain, TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Payment. TON benefits from
being able to leverage Telegram's user base of ~900M users. It is
currently experiencing significant growth in TVL and trading volume
bolstered by USDT integration and incentive programs like The Open
League.

 ATTENTION IS ALL YOU NEED (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Attention is the most valuable yet misunderstood resource. Big tech
has attempted to monetize it to the greatest extent possible via
algorithms. These companies aim to capture, retain, and monetize
attention, creating the attention economy that dominates the internet
today. GameStop's stock pump and memecoins exemplify how attention can
be monetized and demonstrate its value ‚Äì crypto democratizes
attention by tokenizing it. Bitcoin's various narratives, from a store
of value to a hedge against World War 3, make it broadly approachable
and create a contagious expression of ideas.
