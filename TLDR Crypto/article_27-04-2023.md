MARKETS & BUSINESS

BITCOIN CRASHES, RETRACES GAINS AMID UNCONFIRMED US GOVERNMENT DUMP
RUMORS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theblock.co/post/228517/bitcoin-price-crash-us-government?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


The markets whipsawed in dramatic fashion yesterday. The day started
out with crypto rising sharply on strong earnings in the stock market.
BTC then experienced a dramatic crash, dumping from $30,000 to below
$28,000, retracing the dayâ€™s gains in a single hourly candle.
Liquidations neared $200 million over four hours. Although the exact
cause is unconfirmed, crypto news alerter "db" reported Mt. Gox and
U.S. government wallets making transactions. Market intelligence
platform Arkham responded but later deleted their reply, clarifying
that the alert was due to a bug fix. After this was confirmed, Bitcoin
then regained some ground, marching up above $29,000 again. 

â€˜OPENSEA IS IN BIG TROUBLEâ€™ AS TIGER GLOBAL CUTS VALUATION BY 76%
(3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.dlnews.com/articles/web3/opensea-valuation-slashed-76-by-tiger-global/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


After an eye-popping capital raise in early 2022, OpenSea has seen its
valuation drop from $13 billion to $3 billion during a harsh bear
market, according to investor Tiger Global. The platform faces
challenges such as declining NFT volume and increasing competition
from rivals like Blur, which was the first platform to really prove
that OpenSeaâ€™s moat was not impenetrable. Trading volumes on OpenSea
have decreased significantly, with Blur now surpassing it. In
response, OpenSea has launched OpenSea Pro to compete with Blur,
offering rewards and commemorations for early users. So far, the
effect of OpenSea Pro and the changes in volume from it have been
lackluster.

CIRCLE UNVEILS NEW METHOD FOR MOVING USDC BETWEEN BLOCKCHAINS (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/26/circle-unveils-new-method-for-moving-usdc-between-blockchains/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Yesterday, Circle introduced the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)
to simplify USDC stablecoin transfers between blockchains, making them
faster, safer, and cheaper. Initially available for Ethereum and
Avalanche transfers, the technology aims to overcome current
fragmentation in USDC's $30 billion market cap. Unlike bridges, which
use wrapped assets, CCTP burns USDC on the source chain and mints it
on the destination chain. Wallet company MetaMask, bridge operator
Wormhole, and bridge aggregator LI.FI are some of the first
infrastructure providers adopting this new method. 

CRYPTO WALLET PHANTOM TO RELEASE PUBLIC MULTICHAIN SUPPORT FOR
ETHEREUM AND POLYGON (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/26/crypto-wallet-phantom-adds-public-multichain-support-for-ethereum-and-polygon/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Phantom, the main wallet on Solana, is set to support Ethereum and
Polygon blockchains, starting on May 1. The multichain integration,
available for Phantom's 3 million users, will allow users to
seamlessly transfer assets across chains, apps, and marketplaces. If
you want to try Phantom out on Ethereum and Polygon but donâ€™t want
to create a completely new wallet, you will be able to import secret
keys from an existing Ethereum wallet to have all of your assets
available in the Phantom interface. This move, opening up Phantom to a
larger pool of crypto users, is yet another example of a larger trend
of decentralized apps going multichain.

BUILDING SECURE SMART CONTRACTS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


This repo from Trail of Bits outlines guidelines and best practices
for writing secure smart contracts. It covers high-level best
practices, incident response recommendations, secure development
workflow, token integration checklists, and EVM technical knowledge.
The repository also offers guidance on various EVM-compatible chains,
examples of common smart contract issues, and information on utilizing
automated tools for securing contracts, such as Echidna, Slither, and
Manticore. 

BLOCKCHAIN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (30 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12749?utm_source=tldr_crypto] 

TXRANK, a dynamic, real-time tool for detecting anomalous blockchain
transactions, generates tracing representations of activity and trains
a large language model as an Intrusion Detection System. Traditional
models have well-defined search spaces, rules, and patterns, but
TXRANK is unrestricted in these ways, enabling it to detect a broader
set of anomalies. Tested on Ethereum transactions, it effectively
identified abnormal transactions in a dataset of 68 million
transactions with an average throughput of 2,284 transactions per
second. Contributions to the crypto ecosystem through this work
include custom data encoding, domain-specific tokenization, and a tree
encoding method tailored for EVM trace representation.

TRANSFORMING STARGATE FINANCE INTO DEFI'S UNIFIED LIQUIDITY POWERHOUSE
(2 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1650917505429282834.html?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


Since the launch of Stargate V2, the protocol has experienced rapid
growth, with over 1.2 million weekly transactions, outperforming its
closest rival by 1.8x in weekly volume. Even with this growth, it has
remained an underappreciated solution, yet it offers a 70% gas cost
reduction, improved credit efficiency, and multi-hop routing. Project
Hydra, a highly anticipated development, aims to capture the massive
wrapped asset market by consolidating non-native asset chains into a
single network of Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs), streamlining the
bridging process. This could significantly reduce STG emissions and
increase fee capture, positioning Stargate Finance as the unified
liquidity layer for DeFi. 

FUNDS OF EVERY WALLET CREATED WITH THE TRUST WALLET BROWSER EXTENSION
COULD HAVE BEEN STOLEN WITHOUT ANY USER INTERACTION (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.ledger.com/Funds-of-every-wallet-created-with-the-Trust-Wallet-browser-extension-could-have-been-stolen/?utm_source=tldr_crypto]


In November of 2022, a critical vulnerability was discovered in the
Trust Wallet browser extension, potentially allowing attackers to
steal all the assets of any wallet created with the extension.
Luckily, the Ledger Donjon quickly found the flaw, which stemmed from
the extension's seed generation process having a total entropy of only
32 bits. This made it possible for attackers to compute private keys
and access funds by knowing an account's address. Fortunately, the
vulnerability was discovered quickly, and Trust Wallet addressed the
issue, likely avoiding what could have been one of the biggest hacks
in crypto history.
