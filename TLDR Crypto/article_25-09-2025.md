building self-driving cars to autonomous blockchain economies. And
he's just one of many amazing speakers [4].

laser-focused on how blockchain is being deployed in enterprise and
government systems right now - including case studies from the FCA,
Estonia's government CIO, and leading companies.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 TETHER EYES $500 BILLION VALUATION IN MAJOR RAISE (5 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Tether is in talks to raise $15-20 billion in a private placement
that could value the El Salvador-based stablecoin giant at
approximately $500 billion, seeking roughly 3% equity stake, though
CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed only that the company is evaluating a
raise from a selected group of high-profile key investors. The
potential valuation would be massive considering Tether's USDT
stablecoin has a market capitalization of about $173 billion, and the
company has solidified its position as the dominant player in the
stablecoin market by offering cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional
currencies. Tether has been expanding its US presence by appointing
former White House crypto policy executive Bo Hines as strategic
adviser and unveiling plans to launch USAT, a US-based stablecoin
designed for American residents, as crypto companies benefit from
President Trump's favorable stance on digital currencies. 

 US CFTC MAKES TOKENIZED COLLATERAL PUSH WITH STABLECOINS (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is launching an initiative
to allow stablecoins as tokenized collateral for margin requirements
in the derivatives market, with acting chairman Caroline Pham calling
collateral management the "killer app" for stablecoins in markets.
Pham continues advancing crypto policy as part of her "crypto sprint"
while President Trump's nominee Brian Quintenz remains delayed in
confirmation, working alongside SEC Chairman Paul Atkins to integrate
digital assets into traditional financial infrastructure. The CFTC is
seeking industry input until October 20 on implementing tokenized
collateral policies, with support from Circle, Coinbase, and Ripple
executives, following the recent President's Working Group report
recommending CFTC guidance on tokenized non-cash collateral adoption.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 HYPERLIQUID'S HOME-GROWN STABLECOIN USDH GOES LIVE (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 USDH, issued by Native Markets, has officially launched on
Hyperliquid with a USDH/USDC spot market and ~$2.2M in early trading
volume. Backed by cash and short-dated Treasuries, USDH was selected
through Hyperliquid's validator-run process, where Native Markets beat
out Paxos, Frax, and others. Reserves will combine offchain management
with onchain transparency via oracles, while a portion of reserve
earnings will fund HYPE buybacks. 

 MORGAN STANLEY TO OFFER CRYPTO TRADING THROUGH E-TRADE (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Morgan Stanley is preparing to launch crypto trading for retail
customers through E-Trade in the first half of 2026, partnering with
startup Zerohash for liquidity, custody, and settlement services while
taking an investment stake in the company. The Wall Street giant will
initially offer direct ownership of BTC, ETH, and SOL rather than
third-party managed funds, allowing clients to cut management fees
while taking on greater risks as the bank develops its own custody
wallet for digital assets. Wealth management head Jed Finn called
crypto trading "the tip of the iceberg," emphasizing that tokenization
of traditional financial assets, including cash, stocks, bonds, and
real estate, will significantly disrupt the wealth management industry
by enabling immediate interest payments and improved efficiency.

 THE IMPORTANCE OF FULL-STACK OPENNESS AND VERIFIABILITY (9 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 As the internet becomes real life, societies must insist on openness
(free, auditable code/designs) and verifiability (users can prove
systems behave correctly) across software, hardware, and biotech. This
matters in health, personal/commercial tech, and civic infrastructure,
where closed stacks create monopoly power and opaque risks. A world of
open, formally verified OSes, secure open hardware, on-device AI,
privacy-preserving cryptography, and public-inspectable sensors
delivers both security and local sovereignty. The crypto ecosystem
should prioritize a fully open and verification-friendly stack for
high-security, non-performance-critical applications, then expand
outward. 

 X402: MACHINE-READABLE PAYMENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coinbase's new x402 protocol introduces a standardized way for
servers to signal that a payment is required using the long-unused
HTTP 402 code. Unlike human-facing paywalls, x402 is machine-readable,
enabling AI agents and other automated systems to detect and process
payments directly. Instead of card details, agents can authorize
stablecoin transfers via cryptographic signatures, which are then
routed through a new entity called a “Facilitator” (similar to a
merchant acquirer) to post payments on-chain. This unlocks a new use
case for stablecoins as native internet money, allowing bots, APIs,
and AI systems to autonomously pay for services, data, or content
online.

 PERP DEX DOMINANCE ROTATES FASTER THAN THE REST OF DEFI (1 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Perp traders are ruthless. Liquidity and users jump to whatever venue
offers the best fills, incentives, and UX, hence the rapid rotations
from dYdX to GMX to Hyperliquid. Other DeFi verticals turn over more
slowly. Aave still leads lending, Uniswap spot, and Lido staking.
Expect the top perp DEX to keep changing hands, even as leaders in
other categories remain sticky. 

 LOW-RISK DEFI ANALYSIS (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Vitalik Buterin has, for the first time, explicitly declared DeFi as
Ethereum's killer app, marking a significant shift from his previously
withheld praise for crypto financial applications due to his
exceptionally high standards requiring broad global impact and
unambiguous societal good. Five financial primitives – holding,
trading, lending, borrowing, and issuing – make quality banking
services globally and permissionlessly accessible rather than limited
to geographic elites. The endorsement comes as Ethereum's metrics show
significant scale: ETH at $540 billion market cap, DeFi assets at $500
billion, DeFi TVL at $100 billion, and Ethereum L1 scaling from 20 TPS
to 10,000 TPS and L2s from 3,000 TPS to 1 million TPS, positioning
Ethereum as the most credibly neutral chain for long-term asset
storage and the foundation for more impactful DeFi primitives like
credit systems.
