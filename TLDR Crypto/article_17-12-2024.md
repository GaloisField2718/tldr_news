 PARIBUS: AI-BACKED, CROSS-CHAIN BORROWING AND LENDING FOR NFTS, RWAS,
LIQUIDITY POSITIONS, & MORE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Many valuable assets are "locked up" - you own them but can't easily
use them to generate value. Paribus unlocks that value for you [4].

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: on Paribus, you can invest in DeFi across
multiple blockchains, using almost any valuable asset as collateral
[4]: NFTs, AMM liquidity tokens, and eventually RWAs. Paribus uses
advanced AI models to assess the value of diverse assets.

→ Borrow against NFTs while keeping exposure to their potential
value increase

→ Use liquidity pool positions as collateral while still earning
yield

→ And soon, loans backed by physical assets

 YOUR DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO ZKVMS (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article compared six leading zkVMs (SP1, RISC0, Jolt, Delphinus,
Nexus, and Powdr) across eight cryptographic algorithms, evaluating
both performance metrics and developer experience. SP1 and RISC0 are
the most mature solutions, with SP1 taking a slight lead due to its
extensive precompile support and lower cycle counts, while both
platforms offered reliable prover networks and strong documentation.
While zkVMs are making zero-knowledge proofs more accessible to
developers, there are current limitations including resource-intensive
proving requirements and the continued performance advantage of custom
circuits for specific use cases.

 DAOS 2.0 (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 With the proliferation of AI agents, we are nearing a new version of
DAOs that aligns with Vitalik Buterin's original vision of
“automation at the center, humans at the edges.” This evolution is
exemplified by projects like Clanker, which enables token launching
through natural language, and Botto, which creates AI-generated
artwork and uses human intervention to decide which art to sell. While
AI-driven DAOs show clear promise in areas with deterministic data
like trading and content creation, they still face limitations in
tasks requiring long-term planning. 

 TORNADO CASH AND THE LIMITS OF MONEY TRANSMISSION (1 HOUR READ) [15] 

 This article challenges the DOJ's attempt to classify Tornado Cash as
an unlicensed money transmitting business under 18 U.S.C. § 1960,
arguing that the statute's broad interpretation contradicts Supreme
Court precedent and FinCEN guidance, which emphasize "control" as a
key factor in money transmission. By applying Section 1960 to Tornado
Cash's non-custodial, decentralized smart contracts, the DOJ risks
prosecutorial overreach, potentially stifling innovation and privacy
tools in blockchain technology.
