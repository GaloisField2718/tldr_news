 BREAKING DOWN COINBASEâ€™S EARNINGS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Coinbase's Q3 performance beat expectations, but the markets were
still not pleased with the results. It had a revenue decline that was
attributed to a slow Q3 across the crypto industry. The growth story
the Company focused on was Base, positioned to be the next Square or
PayPal through peer-to-peer and merchant payments. Although trading
volumes dropped, the company's international regulatory outlook
improved in the quarter, giving it greater potential for growth.
Nevertheless, the third consecutive quarter of declining revenue
outweighed the positive elements of the release.
