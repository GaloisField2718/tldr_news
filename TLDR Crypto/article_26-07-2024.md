MARKETS & BUSINESS

 WALL STREET STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ETHEREUM (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Wall Street struggles to grasp Ethereum's value, with BlackRock
simplifying it as "a bet on blockchain technology," which may not
resonate with traditional investors. Despite Ethereum ETFs launching,
ETH's price has dropped. Analysts maintain a bearish outlook on ETH,
highlighting stagnant fundamentals, lack of major marketing, and
competition from platforms like Solana as key challenges. 

 PROPOSED ETHENA ALLOCATION TO BLACKROCK BUIDL (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ethena Labs has introduced reward-bearing asset proposals, inviting
issuers to pitch for an allocation from its $45 million Reserve Fund
and $250 million in USDe's liquid cash backing. Early applicants
include Securitize, distributors of BlackRock's BUIDL, and
SteakhouseFi's USDC. Governance will be managed by a newly launched
Risk Committee of industry professionals to oversee and approve these
allocations.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 TON BLOCKCHAIN GASLESS TRANSACTIONS GO LIVE FOLLOWING LAUNCH OF NEW
SMART WALLET STANDARD (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Gasless transactions are now possible on the TON blockchain because
of the W5 smart wallet standard recently developed and launched by
Tonkeeper. This allows users to pay transaction fees using USDT
instead of toncoin. The TON teams hopes to simplify the user
experience and encourage wider adoption by eliminating the need to
hold native blockchain currency for transactions. 

 JITO RESTAKING: A NEXT-GEN INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORM (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The Jito Foundation has launched Jito Restaking, a hybrid
infrastructure platform with two main components: the Vault Program,
which manages Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) and enforces slashing
conditions, and the Restaking Program, which coordinates AVSs and
operators, handling rewards and penalties. This platform enhances
token utility, supports various staking strategies, and aims to secure
networks with flexible, multi-asset solutions.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 UNISWAP VS RAYDIUM (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Raydium has half the daily volumes of Uniswap, but higher fees and
distribution to RAY holders mean the token accrues more real yield
than UNI. RAY's market capitalization is 10% of UNI, giving a market
cap to protocol fees ratio of 1.4x versus UNI at 6.7x. This mispricing
is likely due to skepticism about Solana memecoin and bot trading,
RAY's aggressive issuance schedule, and Uniswap's better brand
positioning. 

 TOYOTA BLOCKCHAIN LAB: HOW TO INTRODUCE MOBILITY INTO THE PUBLIC
BLOCKCHAIN (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Toyota Blockchain Lab is exploring the concept of Mobility-Oriented
Accounts, which would represent vehicles as smart accounts on Ethereum
using the ERC-4337 account abstraction standard. Their design
addresses critical management challenges and enables multiple
stakeholders to be involved in vehicle-related transactions. Toyota
deployed the MOA and KeyToken contracts on Ethereum, allowing for the
digital representation of basic vehicle operations and granting
flexible permissions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EASILY CONVERT USDT TO USDC (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Users can now transfer USDT on Tron to Coinbase Wallet, where it will
convert to USDC on Base for free. 

 AAVE PROPOSES FEE SWITCH UPGRADE (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Leveraging the introduction of Umbrella, Aave has proposed
significant upgrades to enhance $AAVE's role in the ecosystem. Key
updates include automating secondary liquidity management,
transitioning the safety module to a slashing-free staking module, and
introducing the "Anti-GHO" ERC20 token. These changes aim to increase
efficiency, generate new revenue sources, and improve protocol
coverage at controlled costs.
