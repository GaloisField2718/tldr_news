 MECHAN-STEIN: HOW COMBINING EXISTING PROPOSALS LEADS TO DIFFERENT
OUTCOMES (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ethereum block design has three goals: encouraging builder
competition, limiting validator sophistication value, and preserving
block space neutrality. Mechan-stein combines elements from enshrined
PBS & MEV-burn, execution auctions, and FOCIL (Fork-Choice Enforced
Inclusion Lists) to achieve all of the desired goals. However, this
achievement comes at the cost of significant complexity and further
research issues. 

 THE PURPOSE BUILT L1 THESIS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Story Protocol evolved from a single IP franchise concept to a
purpose-built L1 designed to address IP management and composability
issues. Existing blockchains couldn't efficiently handle the complex
graph structure of IP relationships and royalty distributions. Story's
L! aims to enable novel applications like one-click IP licensing,
creator-owned AI models, and IP tokenization. Purpose-built L1s
solving specific problems, as opposed to general-purpose chains, will
thrive in the future.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 THE MAGIC BEHIND ALLIANCEDAO (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AllianceDAO's success lies in the principle of "mutual honesty"
between mentors and founders, fostering an environment where candid
feedback is valued over politeness. This approach ensures that
founders receive the tough but necessary guidance to avoid costly
mistakes, while also providing a safe space to discuss their deepest
challenges â€” something that's crucial for their mental well-being
and long-term success. 

 THE LIQUIDITY LAYER OF SOLANA - KAMINO (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Kamino offers automated liquidity vaults, leveraged exposure,
borrowing and lending, and long/short trading. With $1.7B in TVL and
over 30% of the Solana TVL market share, Kamino has shown strong
growth and staying power, further evidenced by its partnership with
PayPal. While currently trading at multiples similar to mature lending
protocols, Kamino's rapid growth and ambitious roadmap suggest
significant upside potential, though risks such as smart contract
vulnerabilities, competitors, and regulatory issues remain.

 CRYPTO CONSUMER APPS (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There's a prevailing belief among founders and investors that the
most intriguing crypto consumer apps are those centered around
speculation, like token launchpads and prediction markets. However,
the next wave of viral consumer apps will more likely capitalize on
crypto's strengthsâ€”irreversible payments, cross-border transactions,
and micropaymentsâ€”to create experiences that traditional payment
systems can't offer. 

 UNDERSTANDING ETHEREUM'S PECTRA UPGRADE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Ethereum Pectra upgrade, expected in Q1 2025, combines the Prague
and Electra updates to enhance the network's efficiency, security, and
user experience. Key features include Account Abstraction, which
empowers EOAs with smart contract capabilities, and increased staking
limits, all aimed at making Ethereum more user- and
developer-friendly.
