 CINDERELLA JUST BECAME THE MOST VALUABLE IP IN TECH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Cinderella isn't just a childhood icon — she's becoming one of the
most valuable assets in modern tech. Elf Labs [4] spent nearly a
decade securing 100+ historic trademarks to characters like
Cinderella, Snow White, and Rapunzel, then fused that IP with patented
AI/AR tech to build a new category of connected entertainment.

THE TRACTION IS REAL: $8M raised from 2,200+ investors, a
T-Mobile–supported telecom partnership, patented interactive content
underway, and a distribution deal reaching 200M TVs.

Investors believe Elf Labs could reshape a $2T market.

MARKETS & BUSINESS

 AI AGENTS POSE IMMEDIATE THREAT TO SMART CONTRACT SECURITY (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Anthropic tested AI “attack agents” using Claude 4.5 and GPT-5
against real-world smart contracts in a sandbox and found they could
autonomously exploit 17 of 34 recent hacks, stealing $4.5M in
simulated funds, and 207 of 405 historical targets for $550M. Even
more worrying, when pointed at ~2,800 fresh contracts with no known
bugs, the agents found two new vulnerabilities that would have enabled
them to steal more funds. The vulnerabilities were mostly classic
issues, but AI made finding and chaining them cheap and fast. 

 BOFA GREENLIGHTS WEALTH ADVISERS TO 4% BITCOIN ALLOCATION (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Bank of America will allow wealth management advisers to recommend
1-4% crypto allocations starting January, reversing its prior policy
that permitted client investment but prohibited adviser
recommendations. The announcement came hours after Vanguard reversed
its longtime crypto ETF ban, aligning BofA with BlackRock and Morgan
Stanley while intensifying pressure on holdouts Wells Fargo, Goldman
Sachs, and UBS. CIO Chris Hyzy positioned 1% for conservative risk
profiles and 4% for higher volatility tolerance among investors with a
strong interest in thematic innovation.

INNOVATION & LAUNCHES

 PRIVATE MARKETS ON ETHEREUM L1 (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Railworld is the first privacy-enabled launchpad on Ethereum Layer 1
that uses Railgun ZK proofs to enable anonymous token deployments from
zk-addresses with anti-snipe protections and fair vesting mechanics.
Users create private accounts to deposit and shield ETH for trading
through Cypher's v4 AMM or launching tokens that seed directly into
dynamic fee pools with immediate liquidity and price discovery. The
platform, launching in the coming weeks, combines Railgun's
zero-knowledge infrastructure with Cypher's custom v4 plugins to
deliver permissionless private swaps and token creation. Railworld
positions itself as bringing liquid, efficient privacy to Ethereum
versus isolated privacy solutions by integrating directly with
Cypher's AMM infrastructure. 

 INTRODUCING FAN360 (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Backroom, a full-stack internet capital markets launchpad on Base,
has launched Fan360, a sports prediction and gaming ecosystem with AI
agents where 90% of fees fund buyback and burn with team lockups at 6
months full lock plus 2-year linear vesting. $ROOM stakers receive
multipliers based on time and value weight to reduce dilution as
Backroom positions itself as Base's gateway for onchain capital
formation, combining curation, acceleration, liquidity, and
distribution in a closed, aligned loop, contrasting with
permissionless ICO/IDO chaos that drowned quality builders in
speculation.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 FUSAKA UPGRADE DEVELOPER READINESS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Fusaka, Ethereum's big scaling + UX upgrade, goes live on December 3.
It introduces PeerDAS and blob-only forks (December 9 and January 7)
so rollups can use up to ~8× more data bandwidth, cutting blob costs
and speeding confirmations. On mainnet, there's a higher block gas
limit (45M → 60M) plus a per-transaction gas cap and code-efficiency
tweaks that lower fees while keeping blocks safe. Wallets get native
R1/passkey support, enabling Apple/Google-style “tap to sign”
flows built directly into Ethereum. 

 WHY GOLD IS WINNING OVER BITCOIN IN 2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Gold outperformed Bitcoin by 58% versus a 12% decline since January
2024 spot ETF launches. Analysts attribute the gap to Bitcoin being
"too young" for institutional trust. Central banks and sovereign
wealth funds prefer gold's established infrastructure and trade
utility. Gold's centuries of trust and financial channels versus
Bitcoin's absence from international settlement systems created a
slower path to reserve asset status than crypto proponents expected.

 GLOBAL CRYPTO CARD LANDSCAPE IS GETTING CROWDED (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Crypto debit and credit cards are increasing, with dozens of teams
now issuing physical and virtual Visa/Mastercard products that let you
spend stablecoins and crypto anywhere cards are accepted. Rewards are
aggressive, and cards plug directly into wallets, DeFi positions, and
on/off-ramp rails. Under the hood, new “card-as-a-service”
providers like Rain, Bitnob, Qbit, and Zebec make it easy for any app
to launch a branded card, so we're seeing rapid experimentation rather
than a few dominant players. 

 WHAT HAPPENED TO RESTAKING (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Restaking tried to let many new networks (“AVSs”) reuse staked
ETH for security, but the target market was tiny, slow-moving infra
teams, early AVS partners often weren't great fits, and EigenLayer
over-engineered slashing while being muzzled by US regulatory risk.
Even so, EigenLayer crushed competitors in restaking and data
availability, shipped EigenDA as key Ethereum DA infra, helped keep
Lido from dominating staking, and proved demand for “verifiable
compute.” The next chapter is EigenCloud with EIGEN at the center,
tools for verifiable applications (not just AVSs), and a big push into
verifiable AI agents using EigenAI, EigenCompute, and EigenDA.
