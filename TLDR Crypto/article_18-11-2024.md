 WINTERMUTE'S PROPOSAL TO OVERHAUL ETHENA PROTOCOL REVENUE SHARE
APPROVED BY RISK COMMITTEE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Wintermute's proposal to allocate a portion of Ethena protocol
revenue to staked ENA (sENA) and related programs was approved by
Ethena's risk committee. Wintermute hopes to better align sENA holders

Foundation is committed to ensuring all future revenue benefits the
protocol exclusively and will be governed transparently via ENA and
sENA stakeholders.

 OP_VAULT EXPLAINED: HOW IT COULD ENHANCE BITCOIN SECURITY (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 OP_VAULT, introduced in BIP 345, introduces security features to
Bitcoin that enable users to create vaults with built-in clawback
mechanisms and monitoring capabilities. It implements three key
components - a recovery path, an unvault key, and an unvault target -
allowing for enhanced security without complex key management
requirements while offering benefits like batched recovery management
and protection against social engineering attacks. OP_VAULT remains in
the proposal stage with some limitations, including fixed destinations
and no batched unvaulting.

GUIDES & TUTORIALS

 ON SEIZING THE MOMENT IN CRYPTO (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The post-US election landscape marks a pivotal moment for crypto,
with regulatory clarity and bipartisan support potentially enabling
U.S. crypto builders to focus on innovation rather than survival. Key
areas of development include stablecoins revolutionizing global
payments, Ethereum's future advancements like the proposed “beam”
chain for improved scalability and security, and broader adoption of
blockchain technology by governments and institutions. 

 A USEFUL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING STABLECOINS: BANKING HISTORY (13
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stablecoins have rapidly evolved into a $160B global market with two
primary categories: fiat-backed stablecoins and asset-backed
stablecoins. Drawing parallels to banking history, fiat-backed
stablecoins dominate because of their simplicity and perceived safety,
while asset-backed stablecoins, issued through decentralized lending
protocols, are expected to grow as onchain lending matures as they
offer transformative potential for payments and financial ecosystems.

 WHY A BITCOIN STRATEGIC RESERVE COULD BACKFIRE (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Proposals for a Bitcoin strategic reserve could backfire by signaling
doubt in the USD's stability, potentially undermining its status as
the global reserve currency. While the best-case scenario positions
the U.S. as a crypto leader, pairing such a reserve with actions that
erode trust in the Federal Reserve, like prematurely replacing Federal
Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell, could damage institutional
credibility and U.S. economic leadership.
