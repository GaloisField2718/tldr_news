READ) [11] 

 Joining a startup can be exciting as you can see your work make a

you join, the bigger your reward - joining too early increases the
risk you end up with nothing, and joining too late may mean a
significantly smaller payout. This article looks at this issue and
discusses the optimal trade-off between risk and reward.
