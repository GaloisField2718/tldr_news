 OPENAI'S LONG-RUMORED INTRODUCTION OF ADS TO CHATGPT JUST BECAME A
WHOLE LOT MORE CONCRETE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI plans to start testing ads in the US for Free and Go tier
users in the coming weeks. Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise users
will not see ads. The Go tier is a new $8 per month subscription with
access to GPT-5.2 Thinking. Ads will not influence the answers that
ChatGPT provides and will always be separated and clearly labeled.
Conversations will be kept private from advertisers. A screenshot of
what the ads will look like is available in the article. 

 MUSK SEEKS UP TO $134 BILLION DAMAGES FROM OPENAI, MICROSOFT (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk wants OpenAI and Microsoft to pay him damages in the range
of $79 billion to $134 billion as he claims OpenAI defrauded him by
abandoning its nonprofit roots and partnering with Microsoft. The
court filing says Musk is entitled to a chunk of OpenAI's current $500
billion valuation as he donated $38 million in seed money when he
helped found the startup in 2015. Musk also plans to seek punitive
damages and possibly an injunction. OpenAI claims the lawsuit is
baseless and is aimed at harassment.

 GOING FOUNDER MODE ON CANCER (52 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sid Sijbrandij, founder of GitLab, got the news that he had cancer on
November 18, 2022. He underwent a brutal care regimen that involved
surgical removal of his tumorous vertebrae and rounds of radiation and
chemotherapy so intense that he required four blood transfusions to
stay alive. After his cancer resurfaced in 2024, he decided to go
'founder mode' on his cancer, assembling a team to navigate his care
journey. This article details the story of how he took charge of his
health. 

 HOW HUMAN SHOULD YOUR HUMANOID BE? (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While the humanoid form factor is likely to stay due to its clear
advantages, that doesn't mean that robots will still stay human.
Boston Dynamics' Atlas is an interesting look at a very different
vision of what a humanoid robot can and should be. Robots don't have
to be limited to what evolution resulted in. They can be engineered to
have capabilities that far exceed humans.

 AI AGENTS STUCK IN PILOT PURGATORY? HERE'S WHY (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Over 70% of orgs are using AI agents, but only 11% of agentic use
cases made it to prod in 2025. In this webinar [10], Camunda's CTO
joins automation experts to cover the proven controls that help AI
agents progress. Secure your spot to learn how to move AI agents from
pilot to prod. [10] 

 A SOCIAL FILESYSTEM (42 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Files represent personal creations, so they should live somewhere
users control. File systems allow data to outlive the software used to
create it. Other apps are able to open the same files to read or write
data, and it's up to the users' choice on what app to use. This is
analogous to how the AT protocol (the protocol behind Bluesky and
other social apps) works. 

 ASCII CHARACTERS ARE NOT PIXELS: A DEEP DIVE INTO ASCII RENDERING (42
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article details how a developer created an image-to-ASCII
renderer. The resulting renderer converts 3D models and still images
into ASCII. The renderer is interactive, and you can move the 3D
models around by dragging. The post is detailed and contains many
interactive examples explaining the work.

 DON'T WASTE YOUR BACK PRESSURE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Agents have improved over the last year due to structures that
provide them with automated feedback and allow them to work on
longer-horizon tasks. This back pressure allows agents to identify
mistakes, and the feedback helps them align on tasks for much longer.
Developers should think about how to build back pressure into their
workflows. Afterwards, they can loop agents until they have stamped
out all of the inconsistencies and issues. 

 AMERICA IS SLOW-WALKING INTO A POLYMARKET DISASTER (6 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Prediction markets let people wager on basically anything. These
sites have recently boomed in popularity and are creeping into the
mainstream. They are transforming news into a form of gambling. It is
unclear whether these sites are meaningful predictors of anything, but
the markets are manipulable.
