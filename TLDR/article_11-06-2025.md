 A FRUSTRATED ZUCKERBERG MAKES HIS BIGGEST AI BET AS META NEARS $14
BILLION STAKE IN SCALE AI, HIRES FOUNDER WANG (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta is finalizing a deal to invest $14 billion into Scale AI, a
company that helps AI startups prepare data to train cutting-edge AI
models. Meta is one of Scale AI's biggest customers. The social media
giant appears to be taking a similar strategy as other tech companies
like Google and Microsoft which are taking large stakes in prominent
leaders in AI rather than buying them outright - Meta is currently on
trial for antitrust claims and it doesn't want to further upset
regulators by acquiring Scale AI. It will take a 49% stake in Scale
AI, and Scale AI's CEO will help lead a new AI research lab within
Meta. 

 OPENAI RELEASES O3-PRO, A SOUPED-UP VERSION OF ITS O3 AI REASONING
MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has launched o3-pro, an advanced reasoning model, to ChatGPT
Pro and Team users, as well as on OpenAI's developer API. Enterprise
and Edu users will get access to the model next week. o3-pro is priced
at $20 per million input tokens and $80 per million output tokens on
the API. The model has access to tools and can search the web, analyze
files, reason about visual inputs, use Python, personalize its
responses using memory, and more. It can not generate images or use
Canvas and its responses typically take longer than o1-pro to
complete.

 IBM NOW DESCRIBING ITS FIRST ERROR-RESISTANT QUANTUM COMPUTE SYSTEM
(8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 IBM has released plans for a quantum compute system that can perform
100 million operations without errors on a collection of 200 logical
qubits. The hardware, which will be called Starling, will be available
for use in 2029. While the system will be able to handle some
problems, it will not be enough to perform the complex algorithms
needed to do things like break encryptions - that would require
waiting for IBM's Blue Jay, a system with 2,000 logical qubits the
company expects to build by 2033. 

 SNAP TO LAUNCH SMALLER, LIGHTER AUGMENTED REALITY SPECS SMARTGLASSES

use AR technology to let people see and interact with digital imagery
overlaid over the physical world. It will run on Snap OS. Developers
will be able to incorporate Google's Gemini AI models and OpenAI's GPT
family of AI models into programs they develop for the smart glasses.
The most recent version of Snap's augmented reality glass was released
in September 2024 to developers who had to pay $99 a month for a full
year under a leasing model.

 REFLECTIONS FROM SAM ALTMAN (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI started almost nine years ago with the goal of building the
most impactful technology in human history: artificial general
intelligence (AGI). The launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, kicked
off the current AI revolution. Over the past two years, the company
had to build almost from scratch around this new technology, which was
a difficult and messy process. Sam Altman considers these years to be
the most rewarding, fun, best, interesting, exhausting, stressful, and
unpleasant years of his life so far. He is confident that OpenAI now
knows how to build AGI and believes that the first AI agents will join
the workforce this year and materially change the output of companies.


 GOOGLE OFFERS BUYOUTS TO EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE COMPANY, INCLUDING
SEARCH (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google has offered buyouts to employees across several of its
divisions in an effort to reduce headcount. The 'voluntary exit
program' applies to US-based employees. The buyout announcement comes
along with a demand for employees to return to the office - workers
who live within 50 miles of an office will be expected to assume a
hybrid work schedule. Google has done multiple buyout offers in a few
units this year.
