 SLICING THE WIFI PINEAPPLE: HOW HACKERS CAN STEAL CREDENTIALS WITH
EVIL PORTALS — AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 A WiFi Pineapple is a penetration testing tool developed by Hak5 for
running security assessments, either internally or with an outsourced
team of ethical hackers. It can be misused by bad actors to phish for
credentials by impersonating the login pages of trusted accounts.

Watch this recorded session by ThreatLocker [4] for an in-depth look
at WiFi Pineapple — and how it can be used for both good and evil.

 	* Introduction to the WiFi Pineapple and its applications
 	* Overview of the "Evil Portal" feature
 	* Best practices for network protection

 APPLE IS REPORTEDLY DEVELOPING AIRPODS WITH CAMERAS: HERE'S WHAT THAT
MEANS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is reportedly prototyping AirPods with integrated cameras. The
integration may be aimed at bringing Visual Intelligence to the
AirPods, allowing them to understand the outside world and provide
information to the user. They could be used together with Vision Pro
headsets to enhance the user experience and strengthen the spatial
computing ecosystem. The AirPods' cameras could enable in-air gesture
controls. The tech is unlikely to debut anytime soon - it won't be
released until 2027 at the earliest. 

 HOW SAM ALTMAN SIDESTEPPED ELON MUSK TO WIN OVER DONALD TRUMP (9
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sam Altman was on the phone with Donald Trump just days before
Trump's inauguration preparing the announcement to build data centers
across the country. Altman was relegated to the overflow room during
the inauguration, but he stood behind Trump in the Roosevelt Room of
the White House the day after as Trump announced Stargate, describing
it as the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history.
Stargate had been in the works for months, but the announcement was
timed for Trump to take credit for it in his first days in office.
This article takes a behind-the-scenes look at how the deal came
about.

 THE DRUG INDUSTRY IS HAVING ITS OWN DEEPSEEK MOMENT (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Summit Therapeutics, a drug company backed by billionaire Bob Duggan,
recently announced that its drug had outperformed Merck's Keytruda in
a lung cancer trial. Keytruda is the best-selling drug in the pharma
industry. Summit had licensed the drug from a little-known Chinese
biotech called Akeso. While Summit's drug still needs regulatory
approval, the news added billions of dollars to the company's market
capitalization and created a watershed moment for the industry. 

 HUMAN-LIKE TEETH SUCCESSFULLY GROWN IN A PIG'S MOUTH (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Scientists have been manipulating genes to grow human cells in
animals for decades. They have now shown it is possible to cultivate
human teeth cells inside of a pig's mouth. The teeth that grew inside
the pigs didn't reach full human tooth size and likely wouldn't stand
up to regular use, but these findings could lead to the development of
biological tooth substitutes. Research shows that more than half of US
adults may be receptive to the technology.

 THE LLM CURVE OF IMPACT ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI's impact on someone's day-to-day job largely depends on their
level. It impacts junior engineers the most, with the impact level
dropping through to the senior level, before becoming useful again for
Staff+ engineers. This may be why developers' experiences vary so
much. The reason some people are skeptical or overly excited may be
because the tasks they are working on are quite different. 

 AI-BY-HAND-EXCEL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This repository contains a collection of Excel exercises that teach
concepts in AI. It covers topics like Softmax, Temperature,
Backpropagation, Long Short Term Memory, Multihead attention,
AlphaFold, and much more. The repository is still being expanded with
more sheets.

 DEFINANCIALIZATION / HYPERFINANCIALIZATION (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The world has become increasingly financialized as a consequence of
bad money. The US dollar serves as a poor monetary instrument because
it doesn't effectively preserve purchasing power over long time
frames. Instead of saving, people are forced to invest. While Bitcoin
simplifies savings and definancializes the world of money and savings,
crypto is producing a world of hyper-financialization. New products
are constantly emerging that attempt to turn anything and everything
into a financial market. The phenomenon will probably continue as fiat
unwinds, but after a long enough time, Bitcoin's core value
proposition will become more apparent. 

 HOW AI TAKEOVER MIGHT HAPPEN IN 2 YEARS (52 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This post contains a short story on what an AI researcher thinks
could be the worst-case scenario for an AI takeover. It is not a
likely scenario, but it is not pure fantasy either - AI progress might
not become as fast or untamable as the story portrays, but it could
happen in the right circumstances. The future is still not set, but
some of the worst outcomes are already plausible.
