 WHATSAPP IS WORKING ON SECURE CROSS-APP MESSAGING TO CONNECT USERS
ACROSS PLATFORMS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 WhatsApp has been working on an initiative for two years that will
allow its users to send messages across different messaging
applications using end-to-end encrypted methods. The initial phase of
the interoperability rollout will enable basic functionalities such as
text, image, voice message, video, and file sharing between
individuals. Advanced features such as calls and group chats are
expected to be introduced later. The feature will be opt-in.
Third-party apps will have to encrypt their messages using Signal's
encryption protocol and meet specific technical standards. 

 ADAM NEUMANN IS TRYING TO BUY BACK WEWORK (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann, who stepped down in 2019, is
attempting to buy the company out of bankruptcy. WeWork was once
valued at $47 billion. It filed for bankruptcy last November, listing
debts of over $18.6 billion at the time of filing. Neumann's current
venture, Flow, is a residential real estate outfit focused on rentals.
Flow received a $350 million investment from a16z in August 2022.

 BLUESKY IS READY TO OPEN UP (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bluesky is removing its invite system and opening its doors to anyone
who wants to sign up. It will start letting outside developers host
their own servers on its underlying AT Protocol later this month.
Bluesky users will be able to opt into experiences that aren't run by
Bluesky and bring their profiles with them to rival apps on the
network. The company plans to make money by charging users for
additional features in its app, taking a cut of purchases for things
like custom feeds (which developers will be able to charge for), and
through a service that will help others manage servers on the AT
Protocol. 

 IT'S CONFIRMED! LASER FUSION EXPERIMENT HIT A CRITICAL MILESTONE IN
POWER GENERATION (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A series of papers detailing the US National Ignition Facility's 2022
achievement of a break-even fusion reaction have passed peer review.
In the breakthrough experiment of December 2022, lasers fired 2.05
megajoules of energy into a fuel source, which resulted in 3.15 MJ
being released. Researchers have fired more energetic lasers and
produced even more energy in several experiments since. Links to the
five peer-reviewed papers are available at the end of the article.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 MOJO CSS (WEBSITE) [10] 

 Mojo CSS is a framework for crafting UIs without shipping any CSS. It
features multiple color themes, a small package size, compatibility
with a wide range of technologies, and more. Developers can use Mojo
CSS to build custom design systems. A short introduction video is
available. 

 THE FASTEST-GROWING COUNTRIES FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, ACCORDING TO
GITHUB (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 GitHub releases data on developer contributions quarterly as part of
its Innovation Graph project. The most recent batch of data, released
on January 18, shows a jump in the number of developers from
Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Pakistan. The data only measures registered
accounts rather than code commits, so it's heavily skewed to less
active contributors.

 THE APPLE VISION PRO (28 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 visionOS suffers from several UI shortcomings. It is difficult to
manage multiple windows on the screen and its eye tracking is not
nearly as precise as it needs to be for productive window management.
The Vision Pro's field of view is very narrow, making it difficult to
have more than two or so apps open without encountering z-axis issues.
These problems result in the device not being a great productivity
tool - better hardware may not change this reality. 

 GFIBER LOOKING FOR EXTERNAL INVESTMENT TO EXPAND TO MORE CITIES (1
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GFiber (formerly Google Fiber) is planning to raise external capital
to expand. The company is currently entirely funded by Alphabet and
customer revenue. GFiber is aiming to be independent from Alphabet,
similarly to how Waymo and Verily have done over the years. External
capital will enable GFiber to scale its technical leadership, expand
its reach, and provide better internet access to more communities. The
internet service provider is operating or has announced availability
in 18 US states.
