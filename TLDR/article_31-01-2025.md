 AI CODING AGENTS DELIVERING INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH IMPACT FOR
ENGINEERING TEAMS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Rather than trying to replace human judgment, Sourcegraph's coding
agents [5] let your teams define specific rules that align with your
standards and processes.

Using a powerful combination of code search and AI, dev teams can
precisely tune these rules and validate them against recent PRs,
ensuring a high signal-to-noise ratio. Customers like Indeed are using
agents in thousands of repos to increase code quality and reduce
delays associated with code reviews.

See the impact for yourself – start using Sourcegraph today [4], and
join the Feb 6 livestream [6] for early agent access and live demos of
real productivity gains.

 GOOGLE QUIETLY ANNOUNCES ITS NEXT FLAGSHIP AI MODEL (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Google revealed its next-gen flagship AI model, Gemini 2.0 Pro
Experimental, in a changelog for its Gemini chatbot app. The model was
available to Gemini Advanced users beginning Thursday, but Google has
since removed the mention of the model from its changelog. The new
model provides better factuality and stronger performance for coding
and mathematics-related tasks. It is still in early preview and can
display unexpected behaviors. The model doesn't have access to
real-time information and isn't compatible with some of the app's
features. 

 OPENAI IN TALKS FOR HUGE INVESTMENT ROUND VALUING IT UP TO $300
BILLION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI is in early talks to raise up to $40 billion in a funding
round led by SoftBank. SoftBank, which will invest between $15 billion
to $25 billion, is helping assemble investors for the rest of the
round. The round would value OpenAI as high as $300 billion - the AI
startup was last valued at $157 billion in October. The funding will
be used to help OpenAI fulfill its roughly $18 billion commitment to
the Stargate project, which will construct new data centers in the US
to power OpenAI's technology.

 FDA APPROVES NEW CLASS OF PAINKILLER – THE FIRST IN MORE THAN 20
YEARS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of a novel
painkiller called suzetrigine for the treatment of short-term
moderate-to-severe pain in adults. The new drug is the first of a new
class of analgesics that aren't addictive. It selectively targets a
sodium channel critical to pain signaling in the peripheral nervous
system, inhibiting pain signals from being sent to the brain. The drug
is not an opioid, which means that medical professionals now have an
alternative to treating pain that doesn't require using a potentially
addictive analgesic. 

 OPENAI PARTNERS WITH U.S. NATIONAL LABORATORIES ON SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH, NUCLEAR WEAPONS SECURITY (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The US National Laboratories will be using OpenAI's AI models for
scientific research and nuclear weapons security. Up to 15,000
scientists working at the National Laboratories will be able to access
OpenAI's reasoning-focused o1 series. The new partnership will involve
scientists using OpenAI's technology to enhance cybersecurity to
protect the US power grid, identify new approaches to treating and
preventing disease, deepen the understanding of fundamental
mathematics and physics, and work on nuclear weapons. OpenAI will also
work with Microsoft to deploy one of its models on a supercomputer at
Los Alamos National Laboratory.
