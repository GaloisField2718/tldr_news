 OPENAI DECLARES ‘CODE RED' AS GOOGLE THREATENS AI LEAD (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared a 'code red' effort to improve the
quality of ChatGPT. Other products will be delayed as a result. OpenAI
is facing immense pressure from competitors, who have narrowed the gap
in the AI race. Google Gemini last month surpassed OpenAI's models in
industry benchmark tests. OpenAI is also facing pressure from
Anthropic, which is becoming popular among business customers. 

 ANTHROPIC REPORTEDLY PREPARING FOR ONE OF THE LARGEST IPOS EVER IN
RACE WITH OPENAI (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic is in early talks to launch an IPO next year. It has
engaged a law firm that previously worked on high-profile tech IPOs
such as Google, LinkedIn, and Lyft. The company has also discussed a
potential IPO with major investment banks, but the discussions are in
an informal preliminary stage. The potential listing will test
investors' appetite for loss-making AI startups amid growing fears of
an AI bubble.

trade-offs.

 WHY LOCAL TECH SCENES HAVE CHANGED (19 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI has changed the relationship between local tech scenes and San
Francisco. The opportunity cost of being anywhere other than San
Francisco is now at an all-time high. However, it is also much easier
for players who want to stay local to start a one-person business and
grow it themselves. AI will enable local tech scenes to produce
promising startups and select for promising talent in very different
ways than they used to. 

 THE JUNIOR HIRING CRISIS (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI is accelerating the erosion of the traditional apprenticeship
model in tech. This puts the 10- to 20-year talent pipeline at risk.
Students and early-career professionals need to start building
relational intelligence now. Relationship skills have always been a
differentiator, but now they're a necessity.
