 HOW DO YOU HELP PREVENT AI AGENTS FROM GOING ROGUE? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You want agents to take action - but you don't want to give them too
much control. Auth0 for AI Agents gives you control with four core
capabilities:

	* USER AUTHENTICATION - to enable a secure login experience
	* TOKEN VAULT [4] — to securely connect your AI agents to 3rd-party
applications
 	* ASYNC AUTHORIZATION (HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP) — a necessary safeguard
that requires explicit user approval for critical actions
 	* FINE-GRAINED AUTHORIZATION FOR RAG — to ensure agents only pull
documents and data the specific user is authorized to see, preventing
data leakage

Auth0 for AI Agents will be generally available soon. Start building
today. [5]

 AMAZON'S AWS SHOWS SIGNS OF WEAKNESS AS COMPETITORS CHARGE AHEAD (22
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Internal bureaucracy has slowed AWS down at a time when it needs to
be nimble. The company's AI efforts have been lackluster, and its
services are becoming less attractive to startups. AWS remains
committed to its longtime playbook, and it retains considerable
strengths and customer loyalty, but it may be losing its edge by
chasing rivals. The cloud market has become more fiercely contested
over the past couple of years, creating competitive pressure that AWS
didn't have before. 

 NVIDIA IS REPORTEDLY PLANNING A ROBOTAXI PROJECT TO CHALLENGE TESLA,
WAYMO (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nvidia is reportedly developing an internal robotaxi project. The
project will follow a single-stage end-to-end technology route in
which one neural network is trained and reinforced through
simulation-generated world models. Nvidia plans to invest $3 billion
and launch operations in the US. It began developing autonomous
driving software in 2015, but it has yet to release a high-level
driving system for mass market vehicles.

 HOW CHINA RACED AHEAD OF THE US ON NUCLEAR POWER (15 MINUTE READ) [8]


 China nearly has as many reactors under construction as the rest of
the world combined. Its nuclear capacity is set to surpass the US by
2030. The country is making breakthroughs in next-generation nuclear
technologies that have eluded the West. It is also investing heavily
in fusion. If China dominates the nuclear export market, it could
expand its global influence, as building nuclear plants creates deep,
decades-long relationships between countries. 

 IN A FIRST, A DATA CENTER IS USING A BIG BATTERY TO GET ONLINE FASTER
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Aligned Data Centers is installing a 31-megawatt/62-megawatt-hour
battery in a new data center in the Pacific Northwest. Having a
battery will allow the data center to pull less power from the grid
when demand is high, allowing it to come online more quickly. Research
has found that today's grid could handle quite a lot more data centers
if facilities could dial back their consumption for a couple of hours
at a time during moments of maximum demand. Aligned's commitment to
paying for the battery itself could serve as a model of socially
responsible AI-infrastructure development.

 CODE LIKE A SURGEON (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Surgeons do the actual work. However, their skills and time are
highly leveraged with a support team that handles prep, secondary
tasks, and admin. The surgeon focuses on the important stuff they're
good at. AI coding tools enable developers to spend all of their time
doing the things that matter. There are a lot of secondary tasks that
AI agents are now good enough to help out with. 

 ANNOUNCING THE SWIFT SDK FOR ANDROID (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Swift SDK for Android enables developers to port their Swift
packages to Android. Over 25% of packages in the Swift Package Index
are already built for Android. The SDK is now in preview release. It
is bundled with the Windows installer or downloadable separately for
use on Linux or macOS.

 192 WEEKS (17 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Eric Zhang, a software engineer, researcher, and designer, recently
left Modal, where he had worked since 2022, to work at Thinking
Machines. Zhang joined Modal when it was still tiny and needed to grow
a lot. The company recently raised at a $1 billion valuation. In this
post, Zhang reflects on the time he spent at the company and details
how it grew to a team of 70 people. 

 TESLA AT THE CROSSROADS: WHY MUSK CHOSE ROBOTAXI OVER MODEL 2 (11
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Elon Musk overruled members of his key senior staff, with some of
them leaving the company, when he decided to choose the Robotaxi over
producing a low-budget EV. If Tesla could pull off its promise of the
Robotaxi, it would mean outsized profits for Tesla and its investors.
The value of having the Robotaxi far outstripped the value of the
Model 2 in stock price. Musk uses Tesla's stock to invest in his other
businesses - if he had chosen not to go forward with the Robotaxi, and
Tesla's stock price collapsed, his entire empire would have gone down.
