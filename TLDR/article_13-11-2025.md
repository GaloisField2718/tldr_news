 OPENAI RELEASES GPT-5.1 TO ALL CHATGPT USERS (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has released the GPT-5.1 family of models. GPT-5.1 Instant is
a high-volume model that uses adaptive reasoning - it can decide when
to think longer on hard prompts. GPT-5.1 Thinking can vary its
deliberation for each question, so simple tasks are faster and complex
work gets deeper analysis. GPT-5.1 Auto routes queries between models.
ChatGPT has gained stronger personalization controls - users can now
pick between different personalities. 

 VALVE ANNOUNCES THREE NEW PRODUCTS: THE STEAM FRAME, STEAM MACHINE,
AND STEAM CONTROLLER (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Steam Frame is a new wireless VR headset with pancake optics, a
110-degree field of view, and inside-out tracking. It will not require
a gaming PC to work. The Steam Machine is a more powerful but less
portable follow-up to the Steam Deck designed to fit into a
standard-sized shelving unit to connect to a display. The Steam
Controller is designed to replace a mouse. All of the new products
will be released in 2026. No prices have been announced yet.

 WAYMO SAYS ITS SELF-DRIVING TAXIS WILL TAKE CUSTOMERS ON FREEWAYS FOR
THE FIRST TIME (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Waymo has started offering robotaxi rides on freeways for customers
in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It is the
first company to offer fully autonomous freeway rides without a human
specialist in the car to fare-paying riders in the US. Freeways are
more controlled environments in some respects, but the higher speed
poses a much higher risk. Cars need to be able to predict what happens
much farther down the road. Waymo has announced plans to more than
double the number of cities it operates in. 

 SCIENTISTS REVEAL HIDDEN QUANTUM LIGHT STATES WITH RECORD 300,000X
BRIGHTNESS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dark excitons are exotic light-matter states found in atomically thin
semiconductors. They usually remain invisible because they emit light
very weakly. Researchers have found a way to make these previously
hidden light states shine brightly and controllably. This discovery
opens up a new frontier for faster, smaller, and more energy-efficient
technologies.

frameworks. Agent Toolkit integrates Stripe APIs with popular agent
frameworks through function calling. The AI SDK integrates Stripe's
billing infrastructure with Vercel's ai and @ai-sdk libraries. Token
Meter integrates Stripe's billing infrastructure with native SDKs from
OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini without any framework
dependencies.

creativity. 

 COINBASE TO LEAVE DELAWARE, REINCORPORATE IN TEXAS (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Coinbase plans to leave Delaware and reincorporate in Texas because
Texas' legal framework is more predictable and efficient. Delaware has
long been the legal home of most big companies in the US, but the
state's courts appear to be biased against founders and their boards.
Texas has capitalized on executives' frustrations with Delaware by
establishing the Texas Business Court and passing laws to make it more
difficult to sue board members at companies incorporated in Texas and
more challenging for shareholders to file stockholder proposals
against companies.
