 APPLE TO SUPPORT BRAIN-IMPLANT CONTROL OF ITS DEVICES (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Apple is taking early steps to enable people to control their devices
with brain-computer interfaces. It is working on a new standard with
Synchron, a company that makes a stent-like device that is implanted
in a vein on top of the brain's motor cortex to read brain signals.
Early testers have been able to use the technology to control iPhones,
iPads, and Vision Pro headsets. Synchron's device has been tested in
10 people since 2019. 

 AFTER BACK-TO-BACK FAILURES, SPACEX TESTS ITS FIXES ON THE NEXT
STARSHIP (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX's Starship has completed a long duration six-engine static
fire and is undergoing final preparations for its ninth flight test.
The company hasn't yet officially announced a target launch date, but
there are signs the launch might happen as soon as next Wednesday. If
everything goes to plan, Starship will enter space and fly halfway
around the world, reentering in a controlled splashdown in the Indian
Ocean. SpaceX will try to catch the Super Heavy booster again. The
company was aiming for as many as 25 Starship test flights this year,
but it will now likely fall short of that number.

 FLEXIBLE BRAIN IMPLANT TAKES MAJOR LEAP FORWARD (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Brain-computer interfaces are systems that allow direct communication
between the brain and external machines. Precision Neuroscience has a
device thin enough that it can be implanted into the motor cortex of
the brain through an incision less than 1 millimeter wide. The device
has been cleared by the FDA for commercial use in patients for up to
30 days. The approval will allow Precision to collect a lot more brain
data, which will help the company develop the algorithms it needs to
translate users' thoughts into commands for machines. Precision plans
to start clinical trials for a fully implanted system in 2026.

 TAKING OUT THE TRASH: GARBAGE COLLECTION OF OBJECT STORAGE AT MASSIVE
SCALE (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A common problem when working with distributed systems on top of
object storage is figuring out how to remove files from object storage
that had been logically deleted either due to data expiry or
compaction. This post looks at how to solve this problem using a
delayed queue, async reconciliation, or both. It also looks at obvious
ways to solve the problem that don't work well in practice, like
bucket policies and synchronous deletion. The solution presented in
the post is highly scalable, cheap, and easy to reason about.
