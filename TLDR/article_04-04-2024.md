 APPLE EXPLORING 'MOBILE ROBOT' THAT 'FOLLOWS USERS AROUND THEIR
HOMES' (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple is reportedly exploring various personal robotics projects in
an effort to create its next big thing. These include a mobile robot
that follows people around their homes and a tabletop device that uses
robotics to move a display around. The projects are said to be in the
very early stages of research and it is unclear if any of them will
ever be released. Apple apparently considered developing robots that
can handle chores but decided against it for now due to
extraordinarily difficult engineering challenges.

 EUROPE‚ÄôS SPACE AGENCY PREPARES TO BLOT OUT THE SUN (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The European Space Agency (ESA) plans to use two separate spacecraft
to create its own solar eclipse to study the Sun's corona. The
spacecraft will fly 150 meters apart, aligned so that one satellite
blocks out all but of corona from the other satellite. They will have
to fly in precise formation down to millimeter accuracy. Studying the
Sun's corona will reveal details about its role in our solar system's
weather. The ESA hopes to launch the mission in September. 

 ‚ÄòMINI LIVER‚Äô WILL GROW IN PERSON‚ÄôS OWN LYMPH NODE IN BOLD NEW
TRIAL (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new experimental treatment developed by biotechnology firm
LyGenesis may lead to patients growing an additional miniature liver.
The approach involves injecting healthy liver cells into a lymph node
in the upper abdomen of a patient with liver failure. The cells
multiply and take over the lymph node to form a structure that can
perform a liver's blood-filtering duties. The first person who
received the treatment (on March 25) is recovering well, but they will
need to be closely monitored for a while to see if the treatment is
both safe and effective. The treatment has worked so far in mice,
dogs, and pigs.

 THE MANY, CONFUSING FILE SYSTEM APIS (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Googling 'File System API' will bring up a lot of similarly named
APIs. This can get confusing as there are multiple standards and
names, but there are actually fewer than it seems at first and many
build on each other, adding layers of functionality. This article
gives a tour of the different file system APIs. Interacting with file
systems is complex - the different APIs handle different actions and
security concerns. 

 WHY IS OBSERVABILITY SO EXPENSIVE? (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Observability costs are on top of mind for many organizations. This
post covers a brief history of modern observability, how the industry
arrived at its current observability cost crisis, and a new way of
thinking about observability costs and pricing models. Over the past
few decades, infrastructure-as-a-service providers and open source
have made it easy to produce voluminous amounts of telemetry, while
little regard has been given to the cost or storage of the telemetry
output, causing a cost crisis in observability tooling. One solution
may be to not send any observability data by default.

 A FIRST LOOK AT EUROPE‚ÄôS ALTERNATIVE IPHONE APP STORES (12 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 There is currently only one third-party iOS app store live in Europe.
Other app stores have been announced and some are in the review
process. One reason for the lack of alternative app stores is due to
Apple's Core Technology Fee, which requires developers to pay Apple 50
euro cents for every annual app install over one million, with
third-party app store developers paying the fee for every first annual
install of their app marketplace. Apple has also made installing
third-party marketplaces a hassle, requiring around a dozen screen
interactions to install each store. 

 STARTUPS ARE ALL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 One topic in the startup world is extremely opaque: founders'
salaries. This causes founders to make all kinds of mistakes, like
paying themselves too early, too late, too little, or too much.
Founders don't get rich with their salaries: most of the money comes
from IPOs, secondaries, and acquisitions. Being a founder means having
to learn to deal with financial uncertainty.
