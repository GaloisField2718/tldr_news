 OPENAI IS REPORTEDLY DEVELOPING ITS OWN X-LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM
(1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is in the early stages of building its own X-like social media
network. The company currently has an internal prototype that contains
a social feed focused on ChatGPT's image generation. It is unknown
whether the company plans to launch the social network as a standalone
app or if it plans to integrate it within the ChatGPT app. Having a
social media app would allow OpenAI to access real-time data to
contain its AI models. 

 META CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG CONSIDERED SPINNING OFF INSTAGRAM FROM
FACEBOOK IN 2018: FTC TRIAL (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mark Zuckerberg considered spinning Instagram out of Meta in 2018 due
to concerns about the rising threat of antitrust litigation against
Facebook. He had predicted that there would be a non-trivial chance
that Meta would be forced to spin out Instagram and WhatsApp in the
next 5-10 years. The company is currently being accused of
monopolizing the social networking market - Instagram and WhatsApp are
at the heart of the antitrust trial, which seeks to cleave the apps
from Meta as a possible remedy. Meta disputes the allegations and says
that regulators are failing to acknowledge a number of rivals.

 ONE DOSE OF EXPERIMENTAL DRUG NEARLY WIPES OUT STEALTHY CHOLESTEROL
IN 'REMARKABLE' TRIAL (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lipoproteins are a type of cholesterol that is undetected by routine
tests and undeterred by existing drugs, diet, or exercise. People with
high levels of the cholesterol are at extremely high risk of
cholesterol buildup in their arteries, which raises their odds of
heart attack, stroke, and early death from cardiovascular problems.
Eli Lilly has developed a drug called lepodisiran that dramatically
reduced levels of lipoproteins for up to one year. The effects waned
after a year but only slightly. 

 DEEP SEA CRAFT FILMED UNPRECEDENTED FOOTAGE OF A COLOSSAL SQUID (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Scientists captured rare footage of a colossal squid on March 9 off
the South Sandwich Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The observed
colossal squid was a juvenile and not fully grown at about a foot long
- mature individuals grow to around 23 feet long and weigh over 1,100
pounds. It was found swimming at around 1,968 feet beneath the
surface. This is the first confirmed live observation of a colossal
squid in its natural habitat. Video of the young squid is available in
the article.

 TECH HIRING: IS THIS AN INFLECTION POINT? (15 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Many engineering managers, directors, heads of engineering and
startups, and mid-sized companies are reporting that they are
currently finding it harder to hire than ever. Some previously common
hiring approaches, like coding problems and take-home exercises, no
longer work. Candidates are likely to inevitably hit potholes that AI
assistants are able to fix eventually. Some companies are starting to
introduce more in-person processes despite the cost. 

 HOW TO BUILD AN AGENT (38 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Building a fully functioning code-editing agent is easy. This post
shows how to build a small yet highly impressive agent in less than
400 lines of code, most of which is boilerplate. It explains how to
use the Anthropic Go SDK to access Claude, what tools are, and how to
access them. The post covers essentially all there is to the inner
loop of a code-editing agent.

 MARK ZUCKERBERG ONCE SUGGESTED WIPING ALL FACEBOOK FRIENDS LISTS TO
BOOST USAGE (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg proposed deleting all friends lists to get
people to use Facebook more in 2022. The idea was to wipe the lists
and have everyone start again. It was discussed over emails but was
never implemented. The company has taken a different approach to
revitalizing the Facebook experience lately by introducing a revamped
friends tab that doesn't show algorithmic content to users. 

 DEEL'S CEO IS NOW IN DUBAI, COMPLICATING RIPPLING'S LAWSUIT (2 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz and his lawyer are now in Dubai, complicating
Rippling's efforts to serve Buoaziz over a lawsuit that accuses him of
bribing a Rippling employee to spy on the company. The UAE has a
reputation for being a safe haven for those wanting to avoid
extradition. Its legal environment makes extradition very difficult,
although the country has told the media it is committed to working
with international partners on law enforcement and recently stepped up
extraditions of some long-wanted criminals. Deel has responded to the
lawsuit by denying all wrongdoing.
