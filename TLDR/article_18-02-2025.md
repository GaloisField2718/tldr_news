 ELON MUSK'S XAI RELEASES ITS LATEST FLAGSHIP MODEL, GROK 3 (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 xAI has released Grok 3 and unveiled new capabilities for the Grok
iOS and web apps. The company used an enormous data center in Memphis
that contained around 200,000 GPUs to train Grok 3. Grok 3 is a family
of models: Grok 3 mini responds to questions more quickly but at the
cost of some accuracy; Grok 3, which beats GPT-4o on some benchmarks;
Grok 3 Reasoning, which surpasses the best investigation of o3-mini on
several popular benchmarks; and Grok 3 mini Reasoning. Subscribers to
X's Premium+ tier will be first to get access to Grok 3. 

 IPHONE 17 DESIGN WILL BE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT, SAYS LEAKER (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new leak claims that the iPhone 17 Air will have its cameras
arranged in a horizontal bar. The iPhone 17 Pro models will use a
larger but still horizontal bar. Along with the new camera layout,
it's been reported that the iPhone 17 Pro will return to having curved
sides. It is unclear how reliable or accurate the rumors are, but the
leaker has been accurate about camera details before.

 FIRST 1.5-MILE STRETCH OF SAUDI'S AUDACIOUS LINE MEGACITY BEGINS TO
RISE (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Construction has begun on the first phase of the Line, Saudi Arabia's
planned 170-kilometer-long megacity in the desert. The first phase,
which will stretch 2.5 kilometers, will be named Hidden Marina. It
will be made up of three individual modular segments measuring 21
million square meters. Hidden Marina will host an initial population
of around 200,000 residents. It will have 80,000 residential units,
9,000 hotel rooms, commercial and retail spaces, fire stations,
schools, police and security services, and other amenities. Residents
will have access to all daily essentials within a five-minute walk and
high-speed rail will provide transit around the metropolis. 

 RESEARCHERS ARE TRAINING AI TO INTERPRET ANIMAL EMOTIONS (1 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Several teams around the world are working on AI systems to help
humans understand animals. A group at the University of the West of
England Bristol and Scotland's Rural College have developed a system
called Intellipig that examines photos of pigs' faces and notifies
farmers if there are signs of pain, sickness, or emotional distress,
and a team at the University of Haifa is training AI to identify signs
of discomfort in dogs' faces. These systems still rely on humans to do
the initial work of identifying the meanings of different behaviors.

 I WAS GIVEN EARLY ACCESS TO GROK 3 EARLIER TODAY, MAKING ME I THINK
ONE OF THE FIRST FEW WHO COULD RUN A QUICK VIBE CHECK (6 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Grok 3 has an around state-of-the-art thinking model that is able to
solve some advanced questions. It is likely somewhere around o1-pro in
terms of capability and ahead of DeepSeek-R1. DeepSearch can produce
high quality responses to various research- or lookup-type questions,
but it can still hallucinate information - even URLs. Overall, Grok 3
+ Thinking feels somewhere around the state-of-the-art territory of
OpenAI's strongest models, and slightly better than DeepSeek-R1 and
Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.
