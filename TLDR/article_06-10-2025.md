 LLM OBSERVABILITY BEST PRACTICES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 This best practices guide [4] is full of practical tips on:

 	* Monitoring LLM workflows end-to-end
 	* Detecting and mitigating security risks
 	* Ensuring reliable, high-quality outputs

WHAT'S INSIDE: LLM workflows often involve multiple calls to managed
LLM platforms, making it difficult to identify the root causes of
errors or latency issues during troubleshooting. Assessing the
functional performance of LLM apps can be equally complex.

Written by the observability experts at Datadog, this guide shows how
LLM Observability addresses these challenges with end-to-end tracing
for LLM workflows.

 APPLE PUTS HARDWARE CHIEF JOHN TERNUS IN THE SUCCESSION SPOTLIGHT (14
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Several of Apple's executives are expected to relinquish their
responsibilities in the near future - some of them were once seen as
Tim Cook's heir, making the future of the company uncertain. The
company needs to urgently beef up its AI business, which could mean a
shake-up or even an acquisition. Big changes are likely, especially as
some executives don't have obvious successors. Cook will likely remain
involved with Apple in some capacity when he eventually steps down as
CEO, perhaps as a board chairman. John Ternus remains the leading
contender as Cook's successor. 

 OPENAI'S INVITE-ONLY VIDEO GENERATION APP SORA TOPS APPLE'S APP STORE
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI's new video generation app, Sora, has snagged the No. 1 spot
on Apple's App Store. The app allows users to generate short-form AI
videos, remix videos created by other users, and post them to a shared
feed. It is only available on iOS and is invite-based. The app gives
users explicit control over how their likeness is used on the
platform, but some videos have sparked debate about its utility,
potential for harm, and legality.

 THE FIGHT TO FIX PROSTATE CANCER CARE (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among American men.
Diagnostics and therapies for the disease generated about $12 billion
to $15 billion worldwide last year. Smarter screening of prostate
cancers can save lives without the harms of overtreatment. New
techniques and treatments cut recovery time down to weeks, with fewer
of the side effects that often follow surgery or radiation. 

 BYD BUILDS WORLD'S FASTEST CAR (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 BYD's Yangwang U9 Extreme recorded a speed of 308.4 miles per hour at
the Papenburg facility in Germany. The vehicle's four electric motors
put out a combined total of more than 3,000 horsepower. There will be
a limited production run of no more than 30 customer cars. BYD has yet
to release pricing, but the queue is expected to fill quickly.

 SCALING ENGINEERING TEAMS: LESSONS FROM GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, AND NETFLIX
(10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Scaling engineering teams is like raising teenagers. They grow fast,
develop personalities of their own, and they need boundaries. Teams
that thrive at scale tend to have structured goal-setting, a ruthless
focus on code quality, and intentional culture building. This post
shares lessons learned from scaling teams at Google, Facebook, and
Netflix. It provides a few frameworks, metrics, and tools to help you
scale to over a thousand engineers without losing your mind or your
best people. 

 VERCEL VS CLOUDFLARE: TWO PHILOSOPHIES OF BUILDING FOR DEVELOPERS (11
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vercel and Cloudflare are in a race to become the default platform
for building modern apps. The two companies are competing with
opposing ideas on what 'developer experience' means. The winner will
be the one who wins developer trust. Whoever balances the developer
experience, scale, and trust will shape how the web will be built in
the next decade.

 THE STABLECOIN DUOPOLY IS ENDING (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Circle and Tether together boast $245 billion in supply - 85% of the
stablecoin market. A few pieces have now come together to poke holes
in this duopoly. It is now much easier to create, swap, and use
stablecoins. New laws are making it possible for competition. The
current stablecoin market is 10 years old, and the race has only just
begun. 

 THE SELF-TAUGHT ENGINEER GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH ELON MUSK AND JEFF
BEZOS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Rocket Lab aims to fly its Neutron rocket, which is reusable, by the
end of the year. Landing the rocket's booster will be a challenge -
only SpaceX has achieved this feat. Rocket Lab's founder, Peter Beck,
has a fixation on detail and form that has guided his course as an
entrepreneur. The company's newly constructed launchpad is an example
of this - it needed to be able to withstand 1.5 million pounds of
thrust, but Beck added another requirement: it also had to look
beautiful.
