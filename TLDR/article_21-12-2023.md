 TESLA REMOVES STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION THIS YEAR (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tesla has reportedly decided not to give stock-based compensation to
employees as part of their annual performance reviews this year. Some
employees who were reaching the end of their four-year vesting cycles
were given stock refreshers to keep their total compensation
competitive. Tesla is still doing modest cost-of-living increases and
adjustments to its base salaries. It is unclear whether this will be a
new policy going forward. Tesla regularly changes its employee
compensations, and not always in a straightforward way. 

 APPLE PLANNING TO LAUNCH VISION PRO BY FEBRUARY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple has ramped up production of the Vision Pro to meet its goal of
launching the device by February. Sales of the device will be limited
to the US to begin with. Customers will need to purchase or pick up
their devices in-store as Apple wants to ensure customers have the
right headband size and Light Seal for an appropriate fit. Apple plans
to do headset assembly for customers who need custom Zeiss
prescription lenses in its retail locations. There probably won't be a
launch event for the device.

 THE BRAIN-IMPLANT COMPANY GOING FOR NEURALINK‚ÄôS JUGULAR (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Synchron has a brain-computer interface that promises to provide an
invaluable communication method to people with severe paralysis
without open brain surgery. The device is delivered like a stent,
inserted into the jugular vein in the neck and then moved to a blood
vessel near the brain's motor cortex. It allows people who suffer from
brain-stem stroke or degenerative diseases to do basic computer tasks
like sending messages and accessing digital health services without
moving a muscle. The company is now in the middle of a US-based
feasibility study, which, if successful, could lead to a larger study
that will determine whether the device gets approved for clinical use.


 WAYMO FINDS THAT ITS DRIVERLESS CARS ‚ÄòSIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED‚Äô
HUMANS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A safety study from Waymo found that its driverless cars led to a
significant reduction in the rates of police-reported and
injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers. There were 85% less
injuries for crashes involving the Waymo Driver and 57% fewer police
reports. The accidents covered in the study included all crashes,
regardless of the vehicle's role in the crash. Waymo is pushing
broadly for international standardization for valid analysis of
autonomous vehicle crash data.

 MY JAW HIT THE FLOOR WHEN I WATCHED AN AI MASTER ONE OF THE WORLD'S
TOUGHEST PHYSICAL GAMES IN JUST SIX HOURS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI can master the game Labyrinth in just six hours. Labyrinth is an
incredibly difficult physical board game that challenges players to
navigate a metal ball through a hole-riddled maze by changing the
orientation of the game platform using twistable knobs on the side of
the game's box frame. It takes fine motor control, dexterity, and a
lot of real-time problem-solving to complete the game. The AI was
exponentially better than humans at completing the game, with a best
time of 14.8 seconds - without cheating.
