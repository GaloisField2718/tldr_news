BIG TECH & STARTUPS

 SPACEX IS BUILDING A NASA CRAFT TO INTENTIONALLY DESTROY THE
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AFTER RETIRING (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 NASA has awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to build a vehicle
to deorbit the International Space Station after its retirement in
2030. The vehicle will effectively destroy the ISS by pushing the
station into reentry from orbit. It is unknown whether the vehicle's
design will be based on one of SpaceX's existing spacecraft. NASA
intends to replace the ISS with private space stations. 

 AMAZON PLANS TO LAUNCH DISCOUNT STORE IN BID TO FEND OFF TEMU AND
SHEIN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Amazon is planning to launch a new section on its site dedicated to
low-priced fashion and lifestyle items. The new storefront will allow
Chinese sellers to ship directly to US consumers, with items arriving
within nine to 11 days. It is an aggressive attempt to fend off
competition from Temu and Shein, who have expanded their presence in
the US in recent years. Amazon will start accepting products for the
storefront this fall. The company has yet to announce when it intends
to debut the storefront.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE BRAIN MAKES A LOT OF WASTE. NOW SCIENTISTS THINK THEY KNOW WHERE
IT GOES (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Two teams of scientists have published three papers that offer a
detailed description of the brain's waste-removal system. Their
research suggests that during sleep, slow electrical waves push fluid
from around cells deep in the brain to its surface, where it is
absorbed into the bloodstream through a sophisticated interface. There
is growing evidence that the brain's waste-removal system is impaired
in Alzheimer's disease - the new findings could help researchers
figure out how to restore the system. 

 TOYS ‚ÄúR‚Äù US RILES CRITICS WITH ‚ÄúFIRST-EVER‚Äù AI-GENERATED
COMMERCIAL USING SORA (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us partnered with ad agency Native Foreign to create a
brand film using OpenAI's text-to-video tool Sora. The film uses
AI-generated video clips to tell the story of the company's founder.
Sora, which was introduced in February, is still not yet available to
the public. The video required quite a bit of human post-production
work to put together, showing that Sora is not yet a turnkey solution
for instantly usable clips. The video, as well as behind-the-scenes
footage showing how it was made, is available in the article.

 IF YOU'RE USING POLYFILL.IO CODE ON YOUR SITE ‚Äì LIKE 100,000+ ARE
‚Äì REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Polyfill.io is being used to infect websites with malware. Websites
running any JavaScript code from the domain are advised to remove it
immediately. The site previously offered code that added functionality
to older browsers. A Chinese organization bought the domain earlier
this year. Some popular CDN providers have created mirrors of the
domain so sites can continue to use it without having to load the
malicious code. 

 FIGMA ANNOUNCES BIG REDESIGN WITH AI (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Figma has announced a major UI redesign, new generative AI tools, and
a built-in slide show functionality. The UI redesign includes a new
toolbar, rounded corners, and 200 new icons. The new generative AI
tools allow users to quickly get started with a design. Figma Slides
is a Google Slides-like feature that allows users to build and share
presentations inside the app. It has interactive features for audience
members and allows designers to present app prototypes right from the
deck. Figma Slides is free while the feature is still beta - it will
eventually become a paid feature once officially launched.

 THE A.I. BOOM HAS AN UNLIKELY EARLY WINNER: WONKY CONSULTANTS (7
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Many businesses think that AI can help them, but they are uncertain
about how. Wonky consultants help businesses figure out how generative
AI can help them. The management consulting industry in the US is
expected to collect $392.2 billion in sales this year. The work that
consultants are enlisted to do varies from business to business and
the results have been mixed. Many businesses have shut down AI-powered
projects after experiencing too many issues, such as the AI giving
incorrect information to customers. 

 SOFTWARE DEFAULTS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Software defaults define the experience for everyone out of the box.
Most customers buy something they just want to work - configuration is
a drag, not a desire. A company's stock product represents how the
company thinks about its product, its customers, and the experience it
imagines is the best one. Developers should be careful about the
default paths that they choose.
