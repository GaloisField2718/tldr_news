 PHIL SCHILLER TO JOIN OPENAI BOARD IN ‚ÄòOBSERVER' ROLE FOLLOWING
APPLE'S CHATGPT DEAL (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple Fellow Phil Schiller has been selected for an observer role on
the OpenAI board. He will be able to observe board meetings but will
not have any voting power. This will allow Apple to gain insights into
how decisions are made at OpenAI. The arrangement will take effect
later this year - details of the situation could still change. 

 THIS IS GOOGLE AI, AND IT'S COMING TO THE PIXEL 9 (4 MINUTE READ) [6]


 The upcoming Google Pixel 9 series will introduce new machine
learning abilities under the branding of Google AI. Google AI includes
features such as Add Me, Studio, and Pixel Screenshots. Add Me appears
to be an upgraded version of Best Take and Studio is likely a
previously seen Creative Assistant app. Pixel Screenshots is a feature
that closely resembles Microsoft's controversial Recall feature except
that it uses screenshots users take themselves instead of recording
everything users do on their devices.

 SPACEX WANTS TO LAUNCH UP TO 120 TIMES A YEAR FROM FLORIDA ‚Äî AND
COMPETITORS AREN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Several agencies are now preparing impact statements for SpaceX's
Starship launch plans. SpaceX plans to launch its Starship mega-rocket
up to 44 times per year from NASA's Kennedy Space Center and up to 76
times per year from the Space Launch Complex at Cape Canaveral Space
Force Station. Elon Musk aims to eventually launch Starship multiple
times per day, with each launch delivering hundreds of tons of cargo
to low Earth orbit or beyond. Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance
have expressed concerns that SpaceX's high flight rate will have
effects on other launch providers with infrastructure at Kennedy and
Cape Canaveral. 

 CHANGING A SINGLE GENE GAVE MICE SUPERCHARGED HEARING (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 University of Michigan researchers have created mice with
supercharged hearing abilities by dialing up the expression of a nerve
growth gene called neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3). Previous research has shown
that increasing Ntf3 expression can improve hearing in middle-aged
mice and help recover some hearing in mice with damaged inner ears.
The treatment works by increasing the number of connections between
hair cells in the ear's cochlea and the brain. The researchers believe
the treatment could potentially work in humans.

 WHY ARE JAPANESE DEVELOPERS NOT UNDERGOING MASS LAYOFFS? (14 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Japan seems immune to many of the layoffs and trends seen abroad.
Employee protections play a major factor in ensuring this stability
for employees. Layoffs are incredibly difficult to implement under
Japanese employment law. Companies need to be under severe financial
difficulty and at risk of insolvency and they have to have exhausted
all other cost-saving measures. There are also cultural factors -
reducing their workforce can reflect poorly on a company's reputation
with the public and prospective future employees. 

 EARTH'S MYSTERIOUS, DEEP-DWELLING MICROBES WE'RE ONLY STARTING TO
UNDERSTAND (37 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article looks into the history of the research into subterranean
life and how it has changed the way scientists see life and the
planet. Earth's crust is teeming with subterranean life that
scientists are just starting to begin to understand. These microbes
may closely resemble some of the earliest single-celled organisms that
ever existed. They make up an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the
biomass on Earth.
