 WHAT WILL OPENAI ANNOUNCE MONDAY? QUITE POSSIBLY AN AI VOICE
ASSISTANT (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's big announcement today may be a voice assistant. The company
is reportedly working on a technology that rolls audio, text, and
image recognition into one product. OpenAI will be holding a
livestream at 10 am PT to announce the product. Google is expected to
announce updates to Gemini at its developer conference tomorrow. 

 APPLE, NETFLIX, AND AMAZON WANT TO CHANGE HOW THEY PAY HOLLYWOOD
STARS (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple will soon begin basing pay on how a series or movie performs.
Talent would receive bonuses on a points system, with the size of the
bonuses being based on the number of people who signed up for Apple
TV+ to watch, how much time they spent viewing, and the cost of the
program relative to the size of its audience. Netflix and Amazon have
also spent months developing plans for performance-based compensation,
but neither have gone public yet with their models. Streaming services
are becoming increasingly more transparent - the practice will make it
easier to tie pay to performance.

 COMMERCIAL SPACE STATIONS APPROACH LAUNCH PHASE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A number of private-sector companies are aiming to harbor commercial
activities in low Earth orbit (LEO) as the International Space Station
approaches its end of service. This article discusses the various
projects, with a focus on Blue Origin's Orbital Reef program, which
recently aced testing milestones for its critical life support system
with assistance from NASA. Orbital Reef plans to build a space habitat
with NASA as a main client starting out, with a wider goal of
fostering a sustainable commercial presence in LEO. The initiative is
backed by NASA's Commercial LEO Destinations program, which is
providing funding to encourage the private sector to build space
habitats. 

 'TUNGSTEN WALL' LEADS TO NUCLEAR FUSION BREAKTHROUGH (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Encasing fusion plasma inside tungsten allowed a tokamak in France to
set a new record by sustaining plasma at about 50 million degrees
Celsius for six minutes. Tungsten has an extraordinarily high melting
point. Using a tungsten-wall environment is for more challenging than
using carbon, but the material allows physicists to sustain hot
plasmas for longer and at higher energies and densities. While
research into nuclear fusion has been slow, the field has made
significant strides over the last few years.

 POPOVER API (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Popover API allows developers to easily display popover content
on top of other page content. It has a standard, consistent, and
flexible mechanism that creates popover content that can be controlled
declaratively using HTML attributes or via JavaScript. This
documentation covers how to use the Popover API with examples. 

 AVOIDING THE SOFT DELETE ANTI-PATTERN (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Programmers hate deleting things, leading people to advocate for soft
deletion, where instead of really deleting a record, you add a field
that marks the record as deleted. This is generally a bad idea and
there are a number of better ways to ensure access to old data. This
article discusses why soft deletion is a problem and discusses several
alternatives that may better meet the needs of developers.

 AN ODE TO EARLY EMPLOYEES (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Being a founder used to be a fancy way of saying 'unemployed'. The
environment was very different back in the 90s, so those who had the
courage to start something were celebrated once they succeeded.
Founders today are still treated as if in a class of their own, but
things are very different. Virtually any founder can raise millions of
dollars before there's a product or revenue, and creating a prototype
has never been easier. This article discusses how things have changed
and how that has affected both founders and their employees. It also
provides suggestions on how founders can start building trusting
relationships and celebrate those who help enable their companies in
their earliest days. 

 ANALYST ON STARLINK'S RAPID RISE: ‚ÄúNOTHING SHORT OF MIND-BLOWING‚Äù

ago. It will have an estimated free cash flow of about $600 million
this year. The business is now self-sustaining and there's still room
for significant growth.
