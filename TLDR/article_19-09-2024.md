 WHAT AMAZON'S STRICT RETURN TO OFFICE POLICY SAYS ABOUT REMOTE WORK
(4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Amazon's move to push employees back to the office five days a week
signals that tech sector employers have regained some leverage over
workers. The tech sector has experienced a lot of layoffs over the
past few years so it's not easy to find a new job, leaving many
feeling stuck. Amazon's change may give other companies cover to
restrict work-from-home a bit more. However, research shows that most
companies have settled into a new hybrid setup and are not likely to
go back. 

 IN US V. GOOGLE, YOUTUBE'S CEO DEFENDS THE GOOGLE WAY (6 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 The central question of US v. Google is whether Google bought its
competitors in the online advertising business only to park them so no
one could possibly upset its dominance. YouTube's CEO Neal Mohan
testified that Google was never attempting to buy up and neuter its
competitors and that it was simply trying to compete. Google has
previously purchased competitors at above market valuation to
integrate their technology. The company claims the acquisitions were
only in service of building better products in a competitive space.
