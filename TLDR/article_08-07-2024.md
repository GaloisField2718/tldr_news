 GOOGLE CONSIDERED BLOCKING SAFARI USERS FROM ACCESSING ITS NEW AI
FEATURES, REPORT SAYS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Convincing iOS users to use Google's own apps instead of Safari has
been a challenge for Google. Google hired former Instagram and Yahoo
executive Robby Stein to oversee the push from Safari. The company
reportedly considered limiting its AI Overviews feature to its own
apps, excluding Safari users, but ultimately decided against the move.


 APPLE GREEN LIGHTS EPIC GAMES STORE IN RAPID REVERSAL (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Apple has given approval for the Epic Games store for iOS in the EU.
Epic's submission was rejected twice previously. The latest decision
was reversed just hours after reports started circulating about it.
Apple objected to Epic's inclusion of a download button and related
copy and has asked the company to fix the buttons in a future
submission of the app. Epic still has a lot of work before its app
store will be ready - it plans to bring the store to iOS in the next
couple of months.

 THERE WILL BE BLOOD (25 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ErythroMer is an experimental blood substitute developed by
researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. It is
made from recycled human hemoglobin wrapped in a membrane to mimic a
tiny cell. ErythroMer comes as a freeze-dried powder that remains
usable for years. It can be reconstituted by simply mixing it with
saline. ErythroMer should be safe for any blood type as its membrane
doesn't include the red blood cell surface proteins that cause
mismatches. It is still in preclinical testing, but it is possible
that ErythroMer could be more durable and versatile than real blood. 

 THE WORLD'S FIRST ANODE-FREE SODIUM SOLID-STATE BATTERY (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The Laboratory for Energy Storage and Conversion has created the
world's first anode-free sodium solid-state battery. The battery
brings the reality of inexpensive, fast-charging, high-capacity
batteries for electric vehicles and grid storage closer than ever. It
has an architecture with stable cycling for several hundred cycles and
is more affordable and environmentally friendly to produce than
lithium batteries. Sodium, common in ocean water and soda ash mining,
is an inherently more environmentally friendly battery material.

 PONGO (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Pongo is Mongo on Postgres with strong consistency benefits. It
treats PostgreSQL as a document database with JSONB support, adding
significant performance and storage efficiency. Pongo takes the
MongoDB API and translates it to native PostgreSQL queries. Using
JSONB means that data is preparsed, allowing faster read and write
operations. JSONB retains the flexibility of storing semi-structured
data while allowing users to take advantage of PostgreSQL's robust
querying capabilities. 

 DUCKDB COMMUNITY EXTENSIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DuckDB has a new extension mechanism that allows users to register
new functions, support new file formats and compression methods,
handle new network protocols, and more. Extensions can be published
via the DuckDB Community Extensions repository. The repository makes
it easier for users to install extensions using a simple syntax.
Extension developers can use the repository to avoid the burdens of
compilation and distribution.

 A NEW AGE OF MATERIALS IS DAWNING, FOR EVERYTHING FROM SMARTPHONES TO
MISSILES (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Composite materials have the advantage of being lighter than the
metal parts they typically replace while being just as strong and
requiring fewer resources to make. The labor-intensive nature of their
manufacturing has made them expensive and limited their application to
a handful of areas. New manufacturing techniques that can churn out
composite parts quickly and cheaply are changing the field. This
article takes a look at emerging composites technologies and the
materials and products they are creating. 

 HERE'S HOW QUALCOMM'S NEW LAPTOP CHIPS REALLY STACK UP TO APPLE,
INTEL, AND AMD (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Microsoft's 12-year-long attempt at making Windows on Arm happen is
starting to pay off. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips
are turning Windows on Arm into a viable platform. While the chips
don't outright beat Apple's M3 chip in every benchmark, this is the
closest Microsoft has been able to compete so far with MacBooks in
price, performance, and battery life. Microsoft's new lineup could
make Intel and AMD scramble to catch up.
