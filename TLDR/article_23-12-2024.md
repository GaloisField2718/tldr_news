 OPENAI ANNOUNCES O3 AND O3-MINI, ITS NEXT SIMULATED REASONING MODELS
(3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI's latest AI 'reasoning models', o3 and o3-mini, are now
available for public safety testing and research access. The model
family was called 'o3' rather than 'o2' to avoid potential trademark
conflicts with British telecom provider O2. o3-mini will offer low,
medium, and high processing speeds, with the higher compute settings
producing better results. It outperforms o1 on the Codeforces
benchmark. 

 APPLE REPORTEDLY DEVELOPING NEW SMART HOME DOORBELL WITH SUPPORT FOR
FACE ID (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is rumored to be working on a new smart home doorbell with
advanced facial recognition. It will be able to integrate wirelessly
with smart home locks and allow people to automatically unlock their
doors with just a face scan. Apple is expected to expand its reach in
the smart home market significantly next year. It plans to release a
new smart home control device that will attach to walls and
potentially a speaker base.

 WE'RE ABOUT TO FLY A SPACECRAFT INTO THE SUN FOR THE FIRST TIME (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Parker Solar Probe will make its closest approach yet to the Sun
on Christmas Eve. It will fly into the solar atmosphere for the first
time. It is estimated that the probe's heat shield will have to endure
temperatures in excess of 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The mission is
aimed at finding the birthplace of solar wind. 

 THE RISK OF CANCER FADES AS WE GET OLDER, AND WE MAY FINALLY KNOW WHY
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While the risk of cancer rises in our 60s and 70s, it drops past the
age of around 80. A study in older mice found that they had higher
levels of a protein that caused cells to act as if they were deficient
in iron, which in turn limited their regeneration rates, restricting
both healthy growth and cancerous tumors. The same processes were
found to be occurring in human cells too. Cell growth capabilities
were boosted when levels of the protein were artificially lowered or
iron was artificially increased.

 MONOLITH (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 Monolith is a deep learning framework for large scale recommendation
modeling. It features collisionless embedding tables, which guarantees
unique representation for different ID features, and real time
training, which captures the latest hotspots and helps users to
discover new interests rapidly. Monolith supports batch/real-time
training and serving. 

 BUILDING EFFECTIVE AGENTS (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The most successful implementations of large language models across
industries were built with simple, composable patterns rather than
with complex frameworks or specialized libraries. This article guides
readers on how to build effective AI agents. AI agents are systems
that dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage. They
maintain control over how they accomplish tasks. Most applications
won't need agents - they are the best option when flexibility and
model-driven decision-making are needed at scale.

 THE NEXT GREAT LEAP IN AI IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND CRAZY EXPENSIVE (16
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's GPT-5 project is expensive and behind schedule. It isn't
clear when, or if, it will work. Microsoft had expected to see the
model around mid-2024. There may not be enough data to train the model
to make it smart enough. OpenAI recently turned to a technique called
'reasoning' to make its large language models smarter. It just
released a new reasoning model smarter than anything else the company
has released before, but there is still no word on when GPT-5 is
coming. 

 GOOGLE CEO SUNDAR PICHAI SAYS SEARCH GIANT HAS SLASHED MANAGER ROLES
BY 10% IN EFFICIENCY DRIVE (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google has slashed a tenth of its managerial roles since last year.
Some of the managers were shifted to individual contributor roles and
are no longer responsible for other employees. The company had
identified 'durable cost savings' as one of its key goals for the
year. Google this year has also slashed hundreds of jobs across
multiple divisions, including ad sales, core engineering, and the
hardware division responsible for the Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit.
