 SIRI FOR IOS 18 TO GAIN MASSIVE AI UPGRADE VIA APPLE'S AJAX LLM (7
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Safari, Spotlight Search, and Siri will gain significant AI-related
enhancements with the release of iOS 18. One of the key features in
the works for Safari is text summarization. Siri will also receive a
similar update, allowing it to generate responses to relay the content
of messages in a simplified way. Apple's AI model will generate basic
responses entirely on-device. More advanced replies or text summaries
will need server-side processing. 

 READ THE WILD EMAIL TESLA IS SENDING TO SUPPLIERS AMID SUPERCHARGER
CHAOS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla sent out an email to suppliers showing how chaotic the
decision-making leading up to the company firing its entire
Supercharging team was. The email shows there was a lack of structure
and consideration in the decision to fire the team. It mentions that
suppliers are expected to be paid, suggesting that Tesla is behind on
its payment obligations. The email asks suppliers to continue
construction on active projects but to hold on breaking ground or
doing pre-construction site walks. A copy of the email is available in
the article.

 THE TEENS MAKING FRIENDS WITH AI CHATBOTS (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Many young users have discovered AI companions. While chatbots have
been described as helpful, entertaining, and supportive, some users
describe feeling addicted to them. This is raising questions about how
AI is impacting young people and their social development and what
would happen if society becomes more emotionally reliant on bots. 

 WORLD'S 1ST 'TOOTH REGROWTH MEDICINE' TO BE TESTED IN JAPAN FROM
SEPT. 2024 (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trials of the world's first tooth regrowth medicine are set to
commence in September at Kyoto University Hospital. The researchers
behind the medicine hope to start selling it in 2030. There have been
no major side effects confirmed in animal studies to date. The
medicine deactivates a protein called USAG-1, which inhibits the
growth of teeth. The medicine is currently targeted at patients

 FIGMA'S JOURNEY TO TYPESCRIPT (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article discusses how the team at Figma automatically migrated
Skew, a custom programming language, to TypeScript without disrupting
a single day of development. Figma created Skew to squeeze additional
performance out of its playback engine. Using Skew made it difficult
to onramp new hires. Skew couldn't easily integrate with the rest of
Figma's code base and it was missing a developer ecosystem outside of
Figma. Using TypeScript enabled streamlined integration, modern
JavaScript features, and seamless onboarding. 

 HOW I GOT PROMOTED AS A STAFF SOFTWARE ENGINEER (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article discusses how a senior frontend engineer and team lead
decided to take on more responsibilities at their existing company and
worked to get promoted as a staff software engineer. Before asking for
more responsibilities, they demonstrated to their CTO that they were
excelling at their current role. They then asked for more
responsibility and then doubled down on their efforts and shipped more
things. The engineer was eventually able to demonstrate undeniably
that they were capable of working at a higher level than their current
role and pushed for a promotion, which was granted.

 AI ENGINEERS REPORT BURNOUT AND RUSHED ROLLOUTS AS 'RAT RACE' TO STAY
COMPETITIVE HITS TECH INDUSTRY (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Accelerated timelines, competition, and a lack of concern from
superiors about real-world effects are themes common across a broad
spectrum of the biggest effect companies. Engineers are increasingly
saying that a large part of their jobs is focused on satisfying
investors and not falling behind in the competition rather than
solving actual problems for users. Some have been switched over to AI
teams to help support fast-paced rollouts without adequate training,
even if they are new to the technology. The immense pressure, long
hours, and constantly changing mandates are causing burnout.
