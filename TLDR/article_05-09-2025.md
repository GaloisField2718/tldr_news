 THIS $1.3T MARKET DISRUPTOR JUST PASSED $110M IN GROSS PROFIT. INVEST
BEFORE THE 9/18 DEADLINE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 PACASO [4] has built a tech platform that simplifies co-ownership of
vacation homes — a market worth $1.3 _trillion_.

Their model has:

 	* $110M+ in gross profit to date.
 	* $1B+ in processed transactions and fees.
 	* Just announced further expansion [4] into Italy, the Caribbean,
and Mexico.

THIS IS A RARE SEC-QUALIFIED PUBLIC OFFERING where retail investors
can buy early-stage shares alongside the same VCs that backed Uber,
Venmo, and eBay.

The Nasdaq ticker _PCSO_ is already reserved. Global expansion is
happening now. And you can join. But not for long.

 AN ANT QUEEN MASS PRODUCES CLONED SONS OF ANOTHER SPECIES (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 An ant queen from the species Messor ibericus was observed producing
cloned males of another species, Messor structor. The two species
split about 5 million years ago. When the Messor ibericus queen makes
daughters, she mixes her DNA with sperm to create hybrids, but when
she makes sons, she erases her own DNA entirely, resulting in males
that are exact clones. The queen had stored the sperm of the other
species in her reproductive tract, resulting in sons with the other
species' genome.

 HOW I SOLVED A DISTRIBUTED QUEUE PROBLEM AFTER 15 YEARS (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Reddit used a simple and scalable queue architecture to record
upvotes that scaled well, but broke in all sorts of tricky ways. The
company eventually moved to durable queues, which enabled failed jobs
to resume from their last completed step, meaning no data was lost
when there were program crashes. Durable queues work by combining task
queues with durable workflows, which helps reliably orchestrate
workflows of many parallel tasks. Architecturally, they resemble
conventional queues, but use a persistent store as both message broker
and backend.
