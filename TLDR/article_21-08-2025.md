 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

 EVERYTHING ANNOUNCED AT MADE BY GOOGLE, INCLUDING PIXEL 10, PIXEL
WATCH 4, AND PIXEL BUDS 2A (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The annual Made by Google event this year was less of a keynote and
more of a variety show, playing out like a special offbeat episode of
The Tonight Show. The event mostly focused on hardware, but Google
spent just as much time hyping up its Gemini AI integrations. This
article presents a summary of everything announced at the event,
including the new Pixel 10 lineup, the Pixel Watch 4, Pixel Buds 2a,
and Gemini AI integrations. 

 META FREEZES AI HIRING AFTER BLOCKBUSTER SPENDING SPREE (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Meta has stopped hiring for its artificial-intelligence division. The
hiring freeze, which went into effect last week, also prohibits
current employees from moving across teams inside the division. It is
aimed at creating a solid structure for the company's new
superintelligence efforts. It is unknown how long the freeze will
last.

 COINBASE BETS ON THE RISE OF AI PAYMENTS FUELED BY DIGITAL DOLLARS (5
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coinbase recently held a Crypto x AI hackathon where about 100
engineers spent the weekend building payment infrastructure with
real-world purpose. Developers at the hackathon were encouraged to
integrate Coinbase's x402 open-source payment protocol, which is
designed to let apps, bots, or machines charge and settle instantly in
stablecoins, into their projects. Coinbase wants to build the back-end
infrastructure of the AI economy. The US Congress recently passed the
first US law regulating stablecoins, giving them a clear legal
framework, allowing developers to take them more seriously. 

 BUILDING A BETTER DATABASE TO DETECT DESIGNER DRUGS (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Designer drugs replicate the effects of known, illicit drugs, but
evade law enforcement. The variations in chemical structures help them
avoid detection, but they also make them unpredictable in the body,
which could pose serious health consequences. A research team has used
computer modeling to create a database of predicted chemical
structures for the improved detection of designer drugs. The database
could someday be a publicly available supplement to the current
illicit drug mass-spectral databases.

 INTRODUCTION TO AT PROTOCOL (47 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Bluesky is built on ATProto, or the Authenticated Transfer Protocol.
This post explains all of the pieces of the network architecture and
how they all fit together. It is aimed at getting readers to better
understand how Bluesky and the underlying protocol work and how it
differs from the Fediverse. The post is a good starting point for
readers who want to start building apps or tools on ATProto. 

 AWS IN 2025: THE STUFF YOU THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S NOW WRONG (7 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 AWS is almost twenty years old, and many things have changed over the
years. Even experienced veterans may find it hard to track all of the
changes, and it's very easy to stumble upon outdated blog posts that
talk about how things used to be. This post collects some of these
changes to help keep developers current. It covers changes to EC2, S3,
networking, Lambda, EFS, EBS, DynamoDB, cost saving vehicles,
authentication, and more.

 ECONOMICS AND AI TAKE OFF (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Many people believe that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), and fully general humanoid
robotics are just around the corner. We are at the cusp of a
revolution poised to increase GDP by many times over. While nearly
everyone will benefit substantially from the widespread use of AGI, a
tiny minority will increase their productivity by a factor of hundreds
or thousands. This creates the potential for out-of-equilibrium
economic shifts. 

 CHATGPT IS SENDING LESS TRAFFIC TO WEBSITES – DOWN 52% IN A MONTH
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Referral traffic from ChatGPT to websites is down 52% since July
2021. Wikipedia, Reddit, and Tech Radar account for 22% of all
citations. Branded websites are losing visibility and millions of
potential referable clicks as ChatGPT now seems to favor a handful of
'answer-first' sources. Brands that don't provide real answers could
be squeezed out of ChatGPT answers.
