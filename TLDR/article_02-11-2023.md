 HERE‚ÄôS A RARE LOOK AT GOOGLE‚ÄôS MOST LUCRATIVE SEARCH QUERIES (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google only shows ads on about 20% of queries. One of the company's
most closely guarded secrets - which search terms make the most money
- was revealed during the company‚Äôs antitrust trial this week. While
the list only shows data for a week in September 2018, it's the first
time anything like this has been revealed before. The top 20 queries
from that list are available in the article. The top three queries by
revenue were ‚ÄòiPhone 8‚Äô, ‚ÄòiPhone 8 Plus‚Äô, and ‚Äòauto
insurance‚Äô. 

 APPLE KEEPS EXPLORING (AND SCRAPPING) NEW WAYS TO DETECT USERS‚Äô
HEALTH (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A new report shows how far Apple wants to go into healthcare and
explains why it hasn't gotten there yet. The company‚Äôs ambitions
have been slowed in parts by concerns that mistakes in the field of
healthcare could tarnish its public perception. Another obstacle has
been getting FDA approval for its technologies. This article details
some of the health features that Apple has considered releasing over
the years.

 AFTER DECADES OF DREAMS, A COMMERCIAL SPACEPLANE IS ALMOST READY TO
FLY (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Dream Chaser spaceplane is almost ready to fly. The plane's
foldable wings and fuselage are covered in ceramic tiles to shield the
spacecraft from the heat of atmospheric reentry. It will be the first
commercial spaceplane capable of orbital flight. The ride back down to
Earth will be at no more than 1.5 Gs. Each spaceplane is designed for
a minimum of 15 flights. It will be able to haul up to 12,000 pounds
into space and bring back about 4,000 pounds of cargo. 

 WHAT CAUSES FAINTING? SCIENTISTS FINALLY HAVE AN ANSWER (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 40% of people faint at least once in their lifetime. Researchers have
discovered a neural pathway that connects the heart to the brain stem
that, when activated in mice, causes them to become immobile almost
immediately. This pathway may hold the key to understanding fainting.
Further study of the pathway could inspire new treatment approaches
for fainting due to cardiac causes.

 HOW BEAR DOES ANALYTICS WITH CSS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Bear Blog doesn't use client-side JavaScript. This post describes how
it logs traffic without using JavaScript or server logs - only CSS.
The site triggers a CSS rule whenever a user hovers their cursor over
a page that makes a URL request to record data. The resulting system
can track unique users without storing IP addresses un-hashed. The
code for the system is available in the article.

 ATTENUATING INNOVATION (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Windows Mobile came too early - Android had the benefit of copying
the iPhone, while Microsoft started development in 2000 with the
Pocket PC 2000 operating system. Apple was able to invent the future
by considering what the core functions of a cell phone would be years
later. AI could be going down the same path as Window Mobile,
especially with Biden's recent executive order, which is rooted in the
past yet arrogant about an unknowable future, proscriptive instead of
adaptive, and the most cynical attempt at regulatory capture the tech
industry has ever seen. 

 WHAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER MEANS FOR OPENNESS IN AI (17 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The Biden-Harris administration has issued an executive order on
artificial intelligence that is about 20,000 words long. The order
tries to address the entire range of AI benefits and risks and will
likely shape every aspect of the future of AI. This article takes a
look at some of the policies in the executive order and how they may
impact openness in AI.
