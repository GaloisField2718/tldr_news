 APPLE INTENSIFIES TALKS WITH OPENAI FOR IPHONE GENERATIVE AI FEATURES
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple has renewed discussions with OpenAI to use its generative AI
technology to power new features coming to the iPhone later this year.
The companies were discussing a deal earlier this year, but work
between the two parties has been minimal since then. Apple is still in
discussions with Google about licensing the Gemini chatbot. It is
unclear which provider Apple plans to eventually use.

of the iPad Air, and a redesigned Magic Keyboard for iPads. The event
will be streamed on Apple's website and YouTube.

 IN THE FIRST AUTONOMOUS RACING LEAGUE RACE, THE STRUGGLE WAS REAL (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League has held its first race. The
driverless Dallara Super Formula racers, outfitted with cameras and
software, struggled to complete a full lap during qualifying time
trials. Cars randomly juked, spun, and stopped during the trial.
During the actual race, the lead racer spun out - and two out of the
other three remaining cars stopped, unwilling to pass the spun-out car
due to their rules. Clips from the race are available in the article. 

 JAPAN'S MOON LANDER MAKES IT THROUGH ANOTHER LUNAR NIGHT (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Japan's Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) has survived three
lunar nights. SLIM was only designed to last until the end of its
first lunar day. Some of its electronics and batteries were already
malfunctioning after the second lunar night. The sensors and other
functions in the lander are gradually being lost, so the chances of it
surviving a fourth lunar night are slim.

 REACT 19 BETA (25 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The React 19 Beta is now available on npm. The update includes new
hooks, new APIS, and support for using async functions in transitions
to handle pending states, errors, forms, and optimistic updates
automatically. There are breaking changes, but they should not impact
most apps. This article details the new features in the beta. 

 GOOGLE HAS LAID OFF ITS PYTHON FOUNDATION TEAM (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google has asked its recently laid-off Python Foundation team to
train its replacements, who will be in the Munich office. The company
similarly laid off its finance department a few weeks ago, moving
positions outside of the country where they are cheaper. The Python
Foundation team maintained a stable version of Python within Google,
tools to keep thousands of third-party packages constantly updated
from their open source versions, highly customized tools, and much
more. It also acted as a help desk for Python users at Google. The
team performed its duties for years with fewer than 10 people.

 THE BUSINESS OF TAKEHOME ASSESSMENTS (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article looks at how the industry does takehome assessments. The
median time for takehome assessments in the industry is 3 hours, with
the longest taking 10 days. Only around 10% of companies compensate
candidates for their work. The main complaints engineers have with
takehome assessments are that they fail to define reasonable time caps
and the requirements are open-ended. The majority of companies issuing
takehomes are design studios, lean web development agencies, and
mobile dev teams based out of Eastern Europe. 

 THE WALLS OF APPLE'S GARDEN ARE TUMBLING DOWN (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 iPhones are just phones. Apple has been building the walls of its
garden higher and higher to ensure customers use its own products and
nothing else, but those walls are now threatening to come tumbling
down. It no longer feels urgent to replace smartphones every few
years. Apple's strategy of restricting users and developers is
starting to fail as laws are being implemented to increase consumer
choice. Being forced to react to regulations will make it harder for
Apple to be a visionary, future-forward company.
