 🚀 FASTER MOBILE RELEASES WITH AUTOMATED QA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-NATIVE SERVICE delivers 80% AUTOMATED TEST COVERAGE
IN WEEKS [6], with tests running on REAL IOS DEVICES and ANDROID
EMULATORS—all in 100% PARALLEL with ZERO FLAKES. [7]

✅ QA cycles reduced to just 15 minutes

✅ Multi-device + gesture interactions fully supported

✅ Reliable test execution with no flakes or false positives

✅ Zero flakes, human-verified bug reports

Engineering teams MOVE FASTER, releases stay on track, and testing
happens automatically—so developers can focus on building, not
debugging.

 INSIDE OPENAI'S CONTROVERSIAL PLAN TO ABANDON ITS NONPROFIT ROOTS (21
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI is currently a $300 billion for-profit company governed by a
nonprofit board. Investors began demanding that the company shed its
quasi-nonprofit status after Sam Altman was fired in November 2023.
The company has been trying to balance the desire to raise capital and
build the tech and stay true to its mission since its beginning, but
the latest move is an attempt to separate these things. This article
discusses the hurdles that OpenAI has had to overcome to make the
transition a reality. OpenAI's board will decide on the company's
future and evolve the OpenAI nonprofit well before the end of 2025. 

 UNCOVERED EMAILS SHOWED HOW META STRUGGLED TO KEEP FACEBOOK
CULTURALLY RELEVANT (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Meta was aware that its cultural relevance was decreasing back in
2022. A series of messages from April 2022 showed how Mark Zuckerberg
had concerns about Facebook's 'Friends' structure and format being
outdated as every other major platform focused on 'Following'. He had
considered ditching the Friends format and even suggested deleting
everyone's Facebook friends and having them start again. This article
contains some of the highlights from Zuckerberg's emails.

 CHINA FIRES UP WORLD'S FIRST THORIUM-POWERED NUCLEAR REACTOR (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 China's Gobi Desert reactor, a two-megawatt research unit engineered
to use molten salt as a fuel carrier and coolant, achieved 'full-power
operation' last June and its team recently succeeded in reloading the
reactor while it was powered up. The Thorium-powered reactor design
offers a more accessible but less weaponizable alternative to uranium.
Using molten salt carries far less risk in the event of a meltdown
compared to water-based systems as salts can carry greater loads of
thermal energy at much lower pressure. The fuel is already molten - in
the event of a breach of a vessel or pipe, it will just leak out and
freeze rather than explode. 

 MAN VERSUS MACHINE AS CHINA SHOWS OFF HUMANOID ROBOTS IN
HALF-MARATHON (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A half-marathon featuring 21 Chinese humanoid robot models was held
in Beijing on Saturday. The 13-mile race was a chance for the country
to show off the latest state of its humanoids. China wants to be a
world leader in humanoid robots by 2027 - its authorities have
lavished support such as subsidies, talent bonuses, and tax breaks on
robotics companies. The first robot finished the race after two hours,
40 minutes, and 42 seconds - the human champion completed the race in
one hour, two minutes, and 36 seconds.

 CLAUDE CODE: BEST PRACTICES FOR AGENTIC CODING (30 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Claude Code is a command-line tool for agentic coding that gives
engineers and researchers a more native way to integrate Claude into
their coding workflows. It is intentionally low-level and
unopinionated to provide close to raw model access without forcing
specific workflows. Claude Code is a flexible, customizable,
scriptable, and safe power tool. This post outlines general patterns
for engineers using Claude Code across various code bases, languages,
and environments. 

 VIBE CODING IS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR LOW-QUALITY WORK (21 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 While AI-assisted coding can be a game-changer, speed means nothing
if developers end up building unmaintainable software. It can be
downright dangerous to accept AI-generated output at face value -
unchecked AI-generated code can massively amplify technical debt. Many
early vibe-coded projects look good on the surface but hide a
minefield of issues. Context, scrutiny, and expertise are required to
discern the good from the bad - the hype of 'AI magic' needs to meet
the reality of software engineering principles.

 OPENAI, WINDSURF, AND THE FUTURE OF WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Cursor and Windsurf aren't just good developer tools, they could
potentially become the AI-powered workspaces of the future. OpenAI
might want Windsurf because of the usage data from users interacting
with models, which could help the company's models catch up to
Anthropic's on coding benchmarks. The competitive landscape is now
getting messy - Microsoft (which makes VS Code) is now directly
competing with Cursor and Windsurf (based on VS Code) through GitHub
Copilot's new agent mode, but it is heavily invested in OpenAI, which
is invested in Cursor and is now buying its biggest competitor. 

 A NEW FRONTIER IN HEART DISEASE: COULD WE ERADICATE CORONARY ARTERY
DISEASE? (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, genetic
profiling, and personalized therapies offer a pathway to rethinking
how coronary artery disease (CAD) is addressed. Efforts over the past
few decades have focused on risk factors like high LDL, smoking, or
diabetes as proxies for CAD, but these often sidestep the core issue
of atherosclerotic plaque buildup in the arteries. Plaque type,
volume, and progress are details that predict heart attack risk more
precisely than cholesterol levels alone. New approaches are using
imaging enhanced by AI to detect plaque and then implementing
gene-slicing techniques to neutralize genetic risks while lifestyle
and medications tackle environmental factors. While cost and
accessibility pose real questions to scaling these therapies, there is
evidence that suggests feasibility.

 WHY CRYPTO DEVELOPER ACTIVITY IS DECLINING (10 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 While developer activity has been ticking down, it has stayed
relatively strong - the same thing can't be said for VC funding, which
has plummeted. 

 OPENAI'S NEW REASONING AI MODELS HALLUCINATE MORE (3 MINUTE READ)

 OpenAI's internal tests show that o3 and o4-mini hallucinate more
often than the company's previous reasoning models, as well as its
traditional non-reasoning models.
