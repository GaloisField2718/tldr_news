 APPLE'S 'FERRET' IS A NEW OPEN-SOURCE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers from Apple and Cornell University quietly released an
open-source multimodal LLM in October. Ferret is a system that can
refer and ground anything anywhere at any granularity in an image. The
model can examine a region drawn on an image, determine the elements
within it that are of use to a user in a query, identify the elements,
draw a bounding box around the detected elements, and answer questions
about the elements. Ferret's release shows that Apple is starting to
be more open with its AI work.

users to interact with on their hands. Prices for the AI Pin start at
$699 and it requires a $24 per month subscription for a phone number
and cellular data.

 QUANTUM COMPUTING‚ÄôS HARD, COLD REALITY CHECK (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A small but vocal set of prominent skeptics in and around the
emerging quantum computing industry say that the quantum computer
revolution is still further off and more limited than many have been
led to believe. Quantum computers have been touted as a solution to a
wide range of problems and some of the more ambitious timelines have
suggested that these machines could be impacting real-world problems
in just a handful of years. However, there's growing pushback against
these expectations as more is discovered about quantum computing. 

 SELF-CHECKOUT HATERS -- AND RETAILERS -- CAN REJOICE: A NEW MACHINE
RINGS CUSTOMERS UP AUTOMATICALLY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Uniqlo has developed a new self-checkout technology that uses RFID
chips to transmit product details and prices when shoppers are in
scanning range. Customers just have to drop off their goods into a
basket and the checkout machine will list the goods prices on a screen
that tells them what to pay. The process takes around 30 seconds and
has been highly popular with customers. The technology has been
deployed at several locations, including the chain's New York shop on
Fifth Avenue.

 NEW DRAFT RULES TARGETING IN-GAME SPENDING WIPE BILLIONS FROM
CHINA‚ÄôS TECH GIANTS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 China has revealed new regulations to restrict online spending in the
gaming industry. The news sent shares of several Chinese tech giants
falling, wiping billions off their collective value. Online games will
be required to set spending limits and in-game measures that could
induce high spending will be banned. In-game measures that could lead
to trading of virtual goods at high prices and large tips to
livestreamers will also be banned. China is currently cracking down on
the online gaming industry to reverse what it sees as a growing trend
of gaming addiction among young people. 

 THE ROADMAP TO PRODUCT/MARKET FIT‚Ä¶ MAYBE (35 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article presents the eight-step process that brought WP Engine
from an idea to a Unicorn. It describes a formula for going from
initial product to Product/Market Fit. The progression goes from
personal fit to market fit, customer fit, building and shipping the
SLC quickly, marketing and sales, retention-driven product
development, prioritizing systematically, ruthlessly, and
strategically, and managing your psychology. The roadmap isn't
failsafe, but it is supported by many years of experience.
