 MEASURING THE IMPACT OF GENAI CODE (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Generative AI is being leveraged everywhere in software development,
with Copilot alone already used by 126,000 companies.

But how does AI-written code actually impact code quality and release
cycles?
This free workshop by LinearB [5] has the data behind GenAI's impact:

	* NEW RESEARCH INSIGHTS from LinearB's GenAI Impact Report [5]
	* CASE STUDIES into how other R&D organizations are measuring GenAI
impact
	* KEY IMPACT MEASURES: [5] adoption, benefits, and risk metrics
	* HANDS-ON DEMO: How you can measure the impact of your GenAI
initiative today

 GOOGLE WORKING ON ‚ÄòPIXIE‚Äô AI ASSISTANT FOR PIXEL 9, DISCUSSED
GLASSES WITH OBJECT RECOGNITION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Pixie is an AI assistant from Google that could launch with the Pixel
9. Powered by Gemini, it will use data from Google products on devices
to perform complex and multimodal tasks. Google has discussed creating
glasses with the ability to recognize objects and advise wearers on
how to use tools. The last bit of news on Google AR was how the
hardware offer effort was being sidelined for a Samsung partnership. 

 AMAZON‚ÄôS PROJECT KUIPER CONFIRMS ITS SUPER-FAST SATELLITE
COMMUNICATION TECH WORKS IN SPACE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amazon's Project Kuiper has successfully validated key technology
that will increase throughput and reduce latency for its satellite
internet service customers. Optical Inter-Satellite Links use infrared
lasers to send data between spacecraft in orbit. The technology allows
Kuiper's satellites to connect with many other spacecraft
simultaneously to form a mesh network in space capable of moving data
30% faster than terrestrial fiber-optic cables running along an
equivalent distance.

 DEEPMIND AI OUTDOES HUMAN MATHEMATICIANS ON UNSOLVED PROBLEM (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 FunSearch is an AI system that can interact with a specially trained
large language model to create short computer programs that generate
solutions to math problems. The system checks to see whether these
solutions are better than known ones, and if not, it provides feedback
to the LLM so that it can improve in the next round. It was able to
discover new solutions to an old problem. One important feature of
FunSearch is that people can see the code created by the model and
learn from it. 

 MODERNA-MERCK VACCINE CUTS ODDS OF SKIN CANCER RECURRENCE IN HALF,
STUDY FINDS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An ongoing randomized vaccine trial involving 157 patients with
high-risk stage III/IV melanoma is showing promising results. Those
who received the vaccine were 49% less likely to die or have their
cancer come back after three years than those who only received
treatment with a cancer drug. Phase 3 trials of the vaccine have
begun.

 CRACKING THE CODE TO VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Vulnerability management in the cloud is no longer just about patches
and fixes. In this latest report, the Wiz Security Research team put
vulnerability management theory into practice using recently
identified vulnerabilities as examples.
You‚Äôll learn:¬†

	* Which technology & vulnerability types to prioritize¬†
	* How to leverage CVSS metrics¬†¬†
	* The essential questions to ask when triaging¬†¬†

 PYAPP (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 PyApp is a wrapper for Python applications that bootstrap themselves
at runtime. It can easily build standalone binaries for every platform
with extremely configurable runtime behavior allowing for the
targeting of different end users. PyApp provides optional management
commands that allow for functionalities like self-updates. 

 ANNOUNCING SVELTEKIT 2 (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 SvelteKit is the official framework for building apps with Svelte.
Version 2.0 adds support for Vite 5 and other small improvements. It
also adds shallow routing, which allows developers to associate state
with a history entry without causing navigation. Shallow routing is
useful for creating modals that can be dismissed by swiping back or
pop-up views of routes that don't require full navigation.

 SHOULD YOU ADD SCREENSHOTS TO DOCUMENTATION? (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article looks at the advantages and disadvantages to adding
screenshots to documentation and provides guidelines for using
screenshots in documentation. Screenshots in documentation can be bad
as outdated screenshots can cause customers to lose trust in the
documentation accuracy, they make pages load more slowly, they make
the documentation less accessible, and using them can cause writers to
produce lower-quality instructions. However, they can be useful as
they make it easier to find relevant parts of the content, provide a
visual frame of reference for readers, and can supplement confusing
task steps. 

 OPENAI DEMOS A CONTROL METHOD FOR SUPERINTELLIGENT AI (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 OpenAI launched a superalignment program earlier this year to find a
technical means to control a superintelligent AI system. It has
devoted 20% of its compute to the effort and hopes to have solutions
by 2027. The first preprint paper from the superalignment team tests
whether a weaker AI (GPT-2) can supervise a stronger one (GPT-4).
OpenAI is offering US $10 million in grants for work on a variety of
alignment approaches.
