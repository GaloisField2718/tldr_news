 DEMAND FOR LITHIUM IS FAR OUTSTRIPPING SUPPLY. INVESTORS ARE PAYING
ATTENTION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Surging demand for AI chips has made NVIDIA investors rich. Lithium
might be next in line: demand is expected to grow¬†20x by 2040 [4] as
automakers go fully electric, far outstripping supply.

Looking for a way to invest in this trend?

EnergyX [4]¬†has developed¬†patented tech [4]¬†that can extract 300%
more lithium than current methods. The company has¬†opened its
investment round to the public [5]¬†for a limited time ‚Äî here's what
you need to know:

‚úÖ $104M+ invested to date, including¬†a $50M round led by General
Motors [5] and a $5M grant from the U.S. Department of Energy

‚úÖ 6 strategic agreements with top lithium producers

‚úÖ 120+ patents across 19 patent families

 TESLA IS HIRING PEOPLE TO DO THE ROBOT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla is employing people to wear motion capture suits to help train
its humanoid Optimus robot. The position pays up to $48 per hour and
requires walking for up to over seven hours a day while carrying up to
30 pounds and wearing a VR headset for extended periods. Employees
must also be between 5'7" and 5'11" tall. Optimus may require millions
of hours of data before it's fully ready to work in Tesla's factories.


 WAYMO IS DEVELOPING A ROOMIER ROBOTAXI WITH LESS-EXPENSIVE TECH (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Waymo's new driverless technology should be able to handle a wider
array of weather conditions without requiring as many cameras and
sensors. The upcoming Waymo-Zeekr has an accessible interior with a
low step, a high ceiling, more leg room, and other features. The car
system has a 360 view of obstacles and its sensors have wipers to
clear them of most dirt and precipitation. Pictures of the
sixth-generation self-driving car are available in the article.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 A PERSONALIZED BRAIN PACEMAKER FOR PARKINSON'S (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A recent study exploring an innovative approach to deep brain
stimulation found that it cut in half the time patients experienced
their most bothersome symptoms. The personalized therapy, called
adaptive deep brain stimulation, tailors the amount of electrical
stimulation to each patient's individual symptoms. Patients note
feeling the difference instantly and most say it helped improve their
perceived quality of life. The study was small, but it represents a
significant step in creating personalized treatments for neurological
and psychiatric disorders. 

 ROCKET LAB ENTERED ‚ÄúHERO MODE‚Äù TO FINISH MARS PROBES‚ÄîNOW IT'S
UP TO BLUE ORIGIN (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Two NASA spacecraft built by Rocket Lab are beginning preparations
for launch on Blue Origin's first New Glenn rocket. The two science
probes will launch between late September and mid-October. They will
take advantage of a planetary alignment between Earth and Mars that
only happens once every 26 months to travel to Mars to help scientists
learn more about the processes that drive Martian climate change.
Assuming the launch is successful, the twin spacecraft will be
expected to arrive in orbit around Mars in early September 2025. The
next launch window is in late 2026.

 SRCBOOK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Srcbook is a tool for creating TypeScript and JavaScript notebooks
(similar to Python's Jupyter notebooks) that enable developers to
create, run, and share reproducible programs and ideas. It has AI
features for exploring and iterating on ideas. Users can export
notebooks to valid markdown. 

 ALGORITHMS WE DEVELOP SOFTWARE BY (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Becoming a better engineer is about becoming a better pathfinder in
problem space. Engineers get better at solving problems by writing
more code. One way to do this is by rewriting code - rewriting code
takes significantly less time than the initial implementation and the
results are usually much better. Breaking assumptions can help
engineers approach problems differently and result in more efficient
solutions.

 AMD SIGNS $4.9 BILLION DEAL TO CHALLENGE NVIDIA'S AI INFRASTRUCTURE
LEAD (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AMD has agreed to buy ZT Systems, an artificial intelligence
infrastructure group, for $4.9 billion in cash and stocks. The
acquisition will help AMD accelerate the adoption of its AI data
center chips, which compete with Nvidia's popular GPUs. The
transaction is subject to regulatory approval. It is expected to close
in the first half of 2025. 

 COMPETING IN SEARCH (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google has the best results because everyone uses it. Being the
default search brings in more data, making the search engine even
better. It is unclear what companies will do if Google was ordered to
stop paying to be the default. Companies like Apple may reinvest the
money they were paying Google previously to develop their own search
engines. This article takes a look at the many possible impacts the
recent antitrust case against Google may have.

 SOFTWARE ESTIMATES HAVE NEVER WORKED AND NEVER WILL (3 MINUTE READ)

 LLM APPLICATIONS I WANT TO SEE (14 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Large language models bring a diverse range of possibilities - some
of these actually rely on new AI capabilities and others will be
things that could have been done before LLMs, but it didn't occur to
anyone to try.
