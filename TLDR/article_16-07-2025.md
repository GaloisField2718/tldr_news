 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 OUR AI AGENT BIG SLEEP HELPED US DETECT AND FOIL AN IMMINENT EXPLOIT
(1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Big Sleep is an AI agent developed by Google DeepMind and Google
Project Zero that actively searches and finds unknown security
vulnerabilities in software. It recently helped Google detect and foil
an imminent exploit - possibly a first for an AI agent. Big Sleep is
being deployed to help improve the security of widely used open-source
projects. AI cybersecurity agents will help free up security teams so
they can focus on high-complexity threats, dramatically scaling their
impact and reach. 

 REFLECTIONS ON OPENAI (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Calvin French-Owen joined OpenAI in May 2024 and left the company
three weeks ago. This post shares a first-hand account of what the
culture of working at the company actually feels like. It covers how
the company operates without giving away any trade secrets. OpenAI
grew quickly from a group of scientists and tinkerers investigating
the cutting edge of science into an organization with the most viral
consumer app in history and ambitions to sell to governments and
enterprises, making it one of the most fascinating organizations in
history at an extremely interesting time.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE SECRET TO BETTER AIRPLANE NAVIGATION COULD BE INSIDE THE EARTH'S
CRUST (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Airbus' Acubed and Google spinout SandboxAQ are developing an
alternative to GPS. Its quantum sensing technology is now inching
closer to commercialization. The MagNav quantum-sensing device uses
quantum physics to measure the unique magnetic signatures at various
points in the Earth's crust. An AI algorithm is then used to match
those signatures to an exact location. The technology could be a
promising alternative to GPS in a time when GPS jamming and spoofing
are on the rise. 

 NIST ION CLOCK SETS NEW RECORD FOR MOST ACCURATE CLOCK IN THE WORLD
(7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) have improved their atomic clock so it can perform timekeeping
with 19 decimal places of accuracy. The aluminum ion clock is 2.6
times more stable than any other ion clock. Its accuracy will help
facilitate new scientific and technological advances, allowing
scientists to explore new concepts in quantum physics and build the
tools needed for quantum technology. It could help physicists explore
physics beyond the Standard Model, such as the possibility that the
fundamental constants of nature are not fixed values but actually
changing.

 MOST AI TEAMS STRUGGLE TO GO FROM PROTOTYPE TO PRODUCTION. GOOGLE +
DATADOG LEADERS SHARE 7 WAYS TO FIX IT (SPONSOR) [13] 

 When AI experiments work great in dev but fail in production, it's
often an observability problem. In a recent fireside chat, Google's
Director of AI and Datadog's VP of Engineering shared 7 key insights
[13] for building production LLMs on Google Cloud. Get the ebook now

 WE'RE RELEASING THE ARTIFICIAL ANALYSIS AI ADOPTION SURVEY REPORT FOR
H1 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Artificial Analysis Adoption Survey Report examines trends in AI
usage and analyzes adoption rates, primary use cases, and demand
across chatbots, coding agents, LLM model families, providers, and
chip companies. The report found companies are starting to use AI in
production, with engineering and R&D being the clear frontrunner use
cases. Google, xAI, and DeepSeek have gained share in the first half
of 2025 while Meta and Mistral have lost share. Organizations are open
to Chinese models if hosted outside of China. 

 TO BE A BETTER PROGRAMMER, WRITE LITTLE PROOFS IN YOUR HEAD (14
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 One trick that helps developers write code faster and more accurately
is to sketch proofs in your head when you're working on something
difficult. Doing this without interrupting flow takes a lot of
practice, but once you get good at it, you'll find a surprising amount
of code will work on the first or second try. This article
demonstrates a few examples of how this technique can be applied.

 THE HALO EFFECT (19 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A new type of deal structure has emerged in AI as an alternative to
acquisitions and hiring. It involves hiring the core team from a
startup and gaining a non-exclusive license to the startup's
intellectual property in exchange for substantial licensing fees,
which are distributed as dividends out to investors and employees.
These startups then continue to operate under new leadership. These
'Hire And License Out' (HALO) deals are still new and remain poorly
understood. 

 THE TESLA DINER IS BASICALLY FINISHED—HERE'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Tesla's Diner, Drive-in, and Supercharger in Los Angeles is getting
close to opening. The site is pretty much done - Elon Musk ate a meal
at the site, and vehicles have been spotted charging at the charging
stalls. The site will be open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when it
finally opens. Photos of the Diner are available in the article.
