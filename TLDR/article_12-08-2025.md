 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 APPLE'S UPCOMING AI VOICE CONTROL WILL CHANGE HOW PEOPLE USE IPHONES
(13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple's new App Intents allows users to tell Siri to complete tasks
with only their voice. Siri will essentially be able to operate apps
with precision within their own interfaces. Testing and perfecting
this feature has become a top priority for Apple's global data
operations team. Apple plans to ship the feature alongside a broader
Siri infrastructure overhaul in the Spring. 

 GITHUB WILL BE FOLDED INTO MICROSOFT PROPER AS CEO STEPS DOWN (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GitHub's CEO, Thomas Dohmke, is leaving GitHub and Microsoft to
become a founder. GitHub and its leadership team will now become part
of Microsoft's CoreAI organization. Dohmke will be staying through
until the end of the year to help guide the transition. It is unclear
whether the departure and the elimination of the CEO position will
change how GitHub operates or the products it creates and maintains.

 SCIENTISTS ARE FINALLY MAKING PROGRESS AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S (5 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 New Alzheimer's research suggests that medicines and lifestyle
changes can slow, prevent, and even reverse the debilitating disease.
This article discusses several of the most cutting-edge and promising
treatments for Alzheimer's. The Health and Human Services Department
recently announced that Dr. Vinay Prasad was returning to the FDA as
head of biologics and gene therapies. Dr. Prasad has shown hostility
towards Alzheimer's treatments and has said before that paying people
to help patients with chores would do more good than funding these
treatments. 

 MOVE FAST AND DON'T BREAK (SAFETY CRITICAL) THINGS (7 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Boom Supersonic's XB-1, the world's first independently developed
supersonic jet, was created with about a tenth of the capital of any
other supersonic program. It was designed, built, and flown
successfully by a team of just 50 people. Foundational elements like
assembling a small, exceptional team were key to the startup's
success, but there were also some non-obvious lessons learned. This
article is the first in a series on lessons learned at Boom on how to
develop hardware quickly and efficiently. It focuses on how Boom uses
software to accelerate hardware development.

 HOW I USE CLAUDE CODE FOR WORK, FUN, AND AS A TEXT EDITOR (32 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 This article looks at several use cases for Claude Code. These
include vibe coding CRUD, using agents to control a VPS, migrating
real production projects, and other projects. Claude Code can even be
used as a text editor - this opens up a lot of new design
possibilities. 

 REFLECTIONS ON THE REACT COMMUNITY (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 React is boring tech at this point. It has one of the largest
ecosystems of developers, packages, and educational content for
building on the web. The composition model of React was the right
architecture choice, and it continues to have benefits. However, the
React of today doesn't feel like the React of 2015-2020. This article
looks at what has changed and makes suggestions on how to grow the
community today.

 THE ENGINEERING MARVEL THAT CHINA HOPES WILL HELP WEAN IT OFF FOREIGN
ENERGY (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 China has started building a giant hydropower project at the edge of
the Tibetan plateau. The $167 billion facility could generate triple
the output of the world's largest hydroelectric facility, China's
Three Gorges Dam, which can power 40 million Chinese homes. China is
determined to become self-reliant in areas of national importance. It
imported nearly a quarter of its energy supply in 2023, a level of
dependency that it is working hard to undo. The project has stirred
accusations that it will give China power to strangle resources beyond
its borders and raised fears of environmental damage. 

 IT'S NOT 10X. IT'S 36X - THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO KILL A $30K
MEETING WITH AI (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Improvements in AI come from embracing constraints. Context
engineering is about understanding the shape of a problem and working
with constraints rather than against them. The constraint is the
feature, not the enemy. You can become significantly more efficient
not by making AI smarter, but by understanding why your current
approach fights human nature, and stopping that fight.

 Creating a consumer-friendly, fully working OS from scratch also
involves getting the OS adopted, which means convincing both users and
developers of its unique features.
