 NETFLIX GETS THE NFL: THREE-YEAR DEAL STARTS THIS SEASON ON CHRISTMAS
(1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Amazon and Netflix have signed a three-year deal that will put
exclusive Christmas games on the streaming service. The first two
games will be aired on Christmas Day. 2025 and 2026 will see at least
one game on the service each Christmas. The NFL is able to cancel all
of its TV deals at the same time in 2029 - this could lead to an
unprecedented bidding war that could upend the entire NFL content
world. 

 HERE'S THE INSIDE STORY OF WHY ELON MUSK FIRED THE ENTIRE TESLA
SUPERCHARGER STAFF (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article presents the story of Tesla's Supercharger firings based
on interviews with eight former charging-division employees, one
contractor, and an email that Tesla sent to outside vendors. Charging
chief Rebecca Tinucci went to meet with Elon Musk about the network's
future the day before the firings. Tinucci had recently cut between
15% to 20% of staff, but Musk wanted more layoffs. She balked at the
request, saying that deeper cuts would undermine the charging
businesses' fundamentals. Musk responded by firing Tinucci and her
entire 500-member team.

 HOW TO PUT A DATA CENTER IN A SHOEBOX (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The world's need for computing requires colossal amounts of power
that will soon exceed what the planet can provide. Superconductors
offer the possibility of drastically lower energy consumption as they
do not dissipate energy when passing a current. While they require
cryogenic temperatures to work, they offer many benefits like
zero-resistance interconnects, digital logic built on ultrashort
pulses that require minimal energy, and the capacity for incredible
computing density due to easy 3D chip stacking. Superconducting
computers can be more power efficient than their classical cousins at
large scales. 

 INTRODUCTION TO CANCER VACCINES (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post presents notes on various topics related to cancer
vaccines. It covers cancer neoantigens, protein characterization,
AlphaFold, different cancer treatments, vaccine production, and more.
Cancer vaccines that target neoantigens are expensive as they have to
be personalized. While individualized cancer vaccines are not yet
practical, they present a promising possibility for significantly
better cancer treatments.

 GOOGLE LETS THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS INTO HOME THROUGH NEW APIS (1
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google is opening up its Home platform to third-party developers
through new APIs that build on the foundation of Matter. Developers
looking to tap into the APIs will need to pass certification before
rolling out their apps. Apps won't be able to access users' smart home
devices without their explicit consent. Google plans to open up access
to the APIs on a rolling basis. The first apps using them will hit the
Play Store this fall.
