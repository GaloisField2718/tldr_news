 Google has unveiled the latest version of its Tensor Processing Unit
(TPU), a custom chip built to run artificial intelligence. The
Ironwood TPU is positioned for inference rather than training.
Inference is considered a high-volume market in the chip world. While
Google pays Broadcom for each TPU in commercial production, it still
saves more money using TPUs when compared to paying Intel, AMD, and
Nvidia to use their chips for inference.
