 WHY GOOGLE THINKS ITS PIXEL PHONES ARE MUCH BIGGER THAN THEIR SALES
NUMBERS (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 While Google's new Pixel lineup doesn't look too different from the
previous generation, a lot has changed under the hood. The company now
believes that real evolution will come from software and connected
devices rather than hardware. It is already finalizing its 2026 phones
and has begun work on its 2027 lineup. The Pixel's share remains
small, accounting for roughly 3% of the market. 

 ORACLE RIDES MAJOR DEALS WITH OPENAI, NVIDIA TO TURN AROUND CLOUD
BUSINESS (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is slated to become Oracle's largest customer, with the
companies having struck deals for more than 5 gigawatts of computing
power, an unprecedented sum. Another of Oracle's largest customers is
Nvidia, which rents capacity from an Oracle cluster of H100 chips in
Japan and from a data center being built in Indonesia. While Oracle's
cloud business is still orders of magnitude smaller than Amazon's,
there's plenty of room for growth. With all of its recent spending,
Oracle recorded a negative annual cash flow for the first time since
1990. Questions about the longevity and margins of offering
infrastructure to train AI models remain.

 CHAN ZUCKERBERG INITIATIVE'S RBIO USES VIRTUAL CELLS TO TRAIN AI,
BYPASSING LAB WORK (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, an organization established and owned
by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, has
launched rBio, an artificial intelligence model trained to reason
about cellular biology using virtual simulations. The breakthrough has
the potential to dramatically accelerate biomedical research and drug
discovery. The model uses a novel approach called 'soft verification',
which uses predictions from virtual cell models as training signals
instead of relying solely on experimental data. The paradigm shift
means researchers can test biological hypotheses computationally
before committing time and resources to costly laboratory work. 

 SPACEX HAS BUILT THE MACHINE TO BUILD THE MACHINE. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE
MACHINE? (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SpaceX opened its massive Starfactory facility earlier this year.
Measuring at about a million square feet, Starfactory is two times as
large as SpaceX's main Falcon 9 factory in Hawthorne, California.
SpaceX has now built the machine to build the machine, but its
Starship rocket is still not yet ready for prime time. Starship's
consecutive failures this year were a major setback for the program.
The vehicle's tenth test flight is scheduled to take place no earlier
than August 24.

 WHAT MAKES CLAUDE CODE SO DAMN GOOD (AND HOW TO RECREATE THAT MAGIC
IN YOUR AGENT)!? (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Claude Code seems less annoying to use compared to Cursor or GitHub
Copilot agents, even with the same underlying models. This article
looks at what makes it autonomous enough to do interesting things
without inducing a jarring loss of control like some other tools, and
walks through how to build delightful AI agents. It's important to
keep things simple, as any complexity you introduce only makes
debugging harder. 

 DYNAMIC CHROME THEMES: BUILDING DHH'S VISION FOR OMARCHY (7 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 A change that adds the ability to change Chrome's theme colors
dynamically from the command line is currently under review. If
approved, it would give power users complete control over their
environment through simple, scriptable interfaces and make the Classic
theme as flexible as GTK/Qt integration. This post explains how the
change was implemented and how it can be used to modify themes from
the command line.

 ELON MUSK ASKED META CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG TO JOIN XAI BID TO BUY
OPENAI, FILING SHOWS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Elon Musk asked Mark Zuckerberg to help him finance a $97.4 billion
takeover of OpenAI earlier this year. Musk was incensed that the
company was pushing to transform into a for-profit entity when he
floated the proposal. Musk and xAI had approached Zuckerberg with a
letter of intent, but neither Zuckerberg nor Meta signed it. The story
was revealed in court filings in a legal case between Musk and OpenAI
initiated last year to stop the startup from converting to a
for-profit entity. 

 CLASS DISMISSED (95 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Alpha School is a teacherless, homeworkless, K-12 private school in
Austin, Texas. Its students have been testing in the top 0.1%
nationally. They learn through self-directed coursework with AI
tutoring apps for two hours a day, spending the other four hours of
the school day in 'workshops' where they learn things like how to run
an Airbnb or food truck, manage a brokerage account or Broadway
production, or build a business or drone. Alpha School's new product,
Timeback, is aimed at scaling Alpha School's concepts and results and
giving students their childhoods back. Timeback will be free to
everyone once it's released.
