 APPLE TO ‚ÄòPAY' OPENAI FOR CHATGPT THROUGH DISTRIBUTION, NOT CASH (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple and OpenAI's partnership isn't expected to generate meaningful
revenue for either party, at least at the beginning. Apple believes
that pushing OpenAI's brand and technology to its devices is of equal
or greater value than monetary payments so it isn't paying OpenAI as
part of the deal. The deal isn't exclusive - Apple is already
discussing offering other chatbots as additional options. Apple
eventually plans to make money from AI by striking revenue-sharing
agreements with AI partners. 

 META TO REDUCE VP POSITIONS FROM 300 TO 250 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta is reportedly looking to cut down on its number of
vice-president positions from 300 to about 250. The company's job cuts
were guided by principles focused on making Meta an even stronger
technology company. These principles included removing multiple layers
of management, canceling projects, making every organization leaner,
building an optimal ratio of engineers to other roles, and investing
in AI and other tools. Meta's capital expenditures on AI and Reality
Labs will range between $35 billion and $40 billion by the end of
2024.

 TESLA CLAIMS IT HAS 2 OPTIMUS HUMANOID ROBOTS WORKING AUTONOMOUSLY IN
FACTORY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A recent tweet from Tesla's official account listed a rundown of the
company's accomplishments under Elon Musk's leadership since 2018,
when the $55 billion pay package was approved by shareholders. The
last item on the list claims that the company has two Optimus robots
performing tasks in a factory autonomously. Musk recently said that
the Optimus robot might go on sale as soon as next year. It is
expected to cost 'less than half of a car'. 

 GIANT CHIPS GIVE SUPERCOMPUTERS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Cerebras, a California-based company, has demonstrated that its
second-generation wafer-scale engine is significantly faster than the
world's faster supercomputer in molecular dynamics calculations. It
can also perform sparse large language model inference at one-third of
the energy cost of a full model without losing any accuracy. Both
achievements are possible due to the interconnects and fast memory
access enabled by Cerebras' hardware. Cerebras is looking to extend
the applications of its wafer-scale engine to a larger class of
problems, including molecular dynamics simulations of biological
processes and simulations of airflow around vehicles.

 SILICON VALLEY'S BEST KEPT SECRET: FOUNDER LIQUIDITY (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Founder liquidity is the practice where founders sell a portion of
their shares during a funding round. It allows founders to reduce risk
and secure personal financial stability while continuing to build the
company with a fresh influx of venture capital. The practice is often
kept secret because it undermines the narrative of the founder who is
'all-in'. It might change how startups are perceived and valued if it
were widely known that founders could de-risk their financial position
while their employees remained all-in.
