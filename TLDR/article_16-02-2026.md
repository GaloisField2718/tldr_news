 OPENCLAW, OPENAI, AND THE FUTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger is joining OpenAI to work on
bringing agents to everyone. OpenClaw will move to a foundation and
stay open and independent. While Steinberger sees the potential in
OpenClaw becoming a huge company, he doesn't find the prospect
appealing and would rather change the world with OpenAI. 

 TIKTOK'S CHINESE PARENT HAS AN APP TO REPLACE HOLLYWOOD (7 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 CapCut users will soon have access to Seedance 2.0, ByteDance's
latest AI video generation model. The model is already available to
users on the Chinese version of CapCut, Jianying. It can generate
coherent story lines, create realistic voice-overs and background
sounds, and generate complex character actions. Seedance 2.0 can
currently only generate videos of up to 15 seconds. It generated some
controversy on launch, with critics raising privacy and copyright
concerns.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 TINY, 45 BASE LONG RNA CAN MAKE COPIES OF ITSELF (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 One of the key steps in the origin of life is the emergence of an RNA
molecule that could replicate itself. RNA can carry genetic
information and also fold into three-dimensional structures that act
as catalysts. This suggests that early life was protein-free, with RNA
handling heredity and catalyzing a simple metabolism. A team of
scientists has discovered a 45-base-long piece of RNA that can make
copies of itself, adding to our knowledge of the conditions in which
life emerged. 

 FUSION STARTUP HELION HITS BLISTERING TEMPS AS IT RACES TOWARD 2028
DEADLINE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Fusion energy startup Helion has hit a key milestone: plasma inside
its Polaris prototype reactor has reached 150 million degrees Celsius.
The company's ultimate goal is to produce plasmas that hit 200 degrees
Celsius. Its reactor design is different from its competitors,
requiring plasmas about twice as hot to function as intended. Helion
plans to extract energy using the fusion reaction's magnetic field
rather than from heat. The company is contracted to sell electricity
to Microsoft starting in 2028, but this will be through a larger
commercial reactor called Orion, which is currently being built.

 ON COGNITIVE DEBT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cognitive debt is the idea that AI-generated codebases are at risk of
falling into a state where nobody knows how they work, leaving them
inextensible, unobservable, and hard to debug. This is already
happening in AI-driven codebases. However, when controlling for the
size and scope of a project, cognitive debt tends to be at least as
bad, if not worse, in pre-AI code bases than in AI code bases. This
fact is obscured because a lot of traditional engineering work is
either managing crippling cognitive debt or avoiding it at enormous
cost. The best AI users are already pretty good at avoiding cognitive
debt, and they're only going to get better at it. 

 BIAS TOWARD ACTION (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Bias toward action is defaulting to the smallest responsible step
that produces real feedback while pre-committing to guardrails. It
helps companies learn faster while making sure that being wrong
doesn't kill them. It's about optimizing for learning speed while
investing in foundations that make you faster. Fast teams use a lot of
information, but they don't wait for perfect information. Their tight
feedback loops allow them to learn quickly.

 META PLANS TO ADD FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO ITS SMART GLASSES
(9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Meta plans to add facial recognition to its Ray-Ban smart glasses
later this year. Its 'Name Tag' feature will let wearers identify
people and get information about them via the company's AI assistant.
The company considered adding facial recognition to the first version
of the glasses in 2021, but pulled back over technical challenges and
ethical concerns. Meta plans to first release Name Tag to attendees at
a conference for the blind before making it available to the general
public. 

 NO CODING BEFORE 10AM (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Companies that don't rebuild how they work from first principles will
get outshipped by teams half their size six months from now.
Engineering teams need to throw out the playbook and write a new one
for the age of AI. This post discusses one startup's new playbook,
which puts agents first as the primary users who do the work. The
engineer's role in the framework is to make sure the agents can do the
work well.
