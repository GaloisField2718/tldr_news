 CRUISE EMPLOYEES ‘BLINDSIDED' BY GM'S PLAN TO END ROBOTAXI PROGRAM
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cruise CEO Marc Whitten announced that GM would no longer fund the
company in a Slack message on Tuesday afternoon. Cruise will be
absorbed into GM and combined with the automaker's own efforts to
develop driver assistance features and eventually fully autonomous
personal vehicles. It is unclear whether employees' jobs are safe.
Several employees reported feeling blindsided by the decision - they
had been following a roadmap to launch a driverless service in Houston
in 2025.

 NASA'S JAMES WEBB TELESCOPE REVEALS UNIVERSE EXPANDING FASTER THAN
THOUGHT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The universe is expanding about 8% faster than initially assumed
possible. New measurements from the James Webb Space Telescope suggest
that the long-established discrepancy between the observed expansion
rate of the universe and the rate we thought possible based on our
knowledge of the cosmos is potentially due to the influence of dark
matter and dark energy. The discrepancy suggests that something is
missing in our understanding of the early universe. The new data
confirms that the universe is expanding faster today than it did
during its first few billion years.

 NOBODY GETS FIRED FOR PICKING JSON, BUT MAYBE THEY SHOULD? (14 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 JSON is famously simple, but its formal definition is quite
complicated. The biggest problem with JSON is the incredible diversity
of parser behavior and non-conformity across and within language
ecosystems. Everything is implementation-defined, which can result in
data loss and other issues. This article looks at how JSON is
designed, how it is used and misused, and how its 'human readability'
features can cause headaches for users.
