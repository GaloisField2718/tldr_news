 XAI SUES FORMER ENGINEER, ALLEGING HE STOLE TRADE SECRETS AFTER BEING
PAID $7M (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 xAI has accused a former employee, Xuechen Li, of taking confidential
information and trade secrets before resigning and joining rival
OpenAI. It has filed a lawsuit alleging that Li willfully and
maliciously copied documents from his work-issued laptop onto at least
one personal system the day after being paid a large sum in cash for
his xAI shares. Li allegedly took extensive measures to conceal his
misconduct, including deleting his browser history and system logs and
renaming and compressing files before uploading them to his personal
system. Li resigned from xAI on July 28 and was scheduled to start at
OpenAI on August 19. 

 CRACKS ARE FORMING IN META'S PARTNERSHIP WITH SCALE AI (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 At least one of the executives Alexandr Wang brought to Meta to help
run Meta Superintelligence Labs has already departed the company.
Ruben Mayer, Scale AI's former Senior Vice President of GenAI Product
and Operations, says he was very happy with his Meta experience and
that he left for a personal matter. Meta's relationship with Scale AI
appears to be shifting as it is working with third-party data labeling
vendors other than Scale AI to train its upcoming AI models. Meta's
researchers reportedly see Scale AI's data as low quality and have
expressed a preference to work with Surge and Mercor, two of Scale
AI's largest competitors.

 ASTRA PILL CUTS HARD-TO-TREAT BLOOD PRESSURE IN LATE-STAGE TRIAL (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AstraZeneca's experimental hypertension pill reduced blood pressure
by more than twice as much as standard treatment during a large
late-stage study. The drugmaker aims to file for regulatory approval
by the end of the year. More studies are still required to confirm
safety and assess outcomes over a long period of time before use of
the pill can be approved. The drug works by reducing the production of
aldosterone, a hormone made in the adrenal gland that helps the body
regulate levels of salt and water. 

 BREAKTHROUGH BREAST CANCER PILL EXTENDS SURVIVAL IN 7-YEAR TRIAL (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Lilly Oncology's Abemaciclib pill, sold under the brand name
Verzenio, can significantly reduce the risk of relapse in some types
of early breast cancer that have spread to the lymph node, according
to the results of a phase 3 clinical trial that has yet to be peer
reviewed. Verzenio is already approved for advanced or metastatic
breast cancer cases that are hormone receptor-positive and for
early-stage breast cancers at high risk of recurrence. It works in
conjunction with hormone therapy to prevent breast cancer cells from
proliferating.

 AI-ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT: A THREE-ACT PLAY (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 There are three fundamentally different approaches emerging in
AI-assisted development. The first is Vibe Coding, which can be
described as asking large language models to build applications and
iterating on the code via chat until it is ready for production. The
second approach is using AI as a Copilot, where the developer asks
models to build parts of applications, and then they review changes,
fix whatever they need manually, and approve or deny the changes. The
third approach is using AI tools as a HUD, only using them to write
code. Each approach has its pros and cons and is suited for different
tasks and skillsets. 

 WHY DO BROWSERS THROTTLE JAVASCRIPT TIMERS? (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 JavaScript's setTimeout(0) can actually run 4 milliseconds later. A
lot of websites spam setTimeout, so browsers set the delay to avoid
draining users' batteries or other issues. Developers could just use
other alternatives. While these options can still be abused, they are
permitted for now.

 CUTTING-EDGE AI WAS SUPPOSED TO GET CHEAPER. IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN
EVER (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The latest AI models are doing more 'thinking', driving up the costs
to complete tasks despite the cost of tokens dropping. This is the
opposite of what many analysts and experts predicted even just a few
months ago. Reasoning can deliver meaningfully better responses, but
it spends significantly more tokens in the process. One way to lower
costs is to use 'dumber' AIs - many use-cases don't require
cutting-edge AI. 

 THE AMUSEMENT PARK FOR ENGINEERS (44 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Anduril started with lofty ambitions of reinventing the defense
ecosystem. The company has now deployed more than 30 products with
thousands of field-tested systems and changed the arc of American
defense technology. This article looks back at the years of explosive
growth to give other founders, engineers, investors, operators, and
everyone else a glimpse of what growth at Anduril was actually like.
