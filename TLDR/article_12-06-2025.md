 HP REVEALS FIRST GOOGLE BEAM 3D VIDEO CONFERENCING SETUP, PRICED AT
$25,000 (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's Project Starline was reborn as Google Beam at Google I/O
last month. The 3D conferencing system, which uses a lot of advanced
hardware, makes users look like they're in the same room as each
other. HP has revealed the first Beam setup - the HP Dimension will be
available later this year for $24,999. It will come with a 65-inch
display (Beam systems will have displays of various sizes) and also
support regular 2D chats using Zoom and Google Meet. Google Beam's
video model requires a lot of intense cloud processing, so customers
will also have to pay for a Google Beam license on top of the hardware
- prices for the licenses have not yet been released. 

 NINTENDO'S SWITCH 2 IS THE FASTEST-SELLING GAME CONSOLE OF ALL TIME
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nintendo sold more than 3.5 million Switch 2 units in the console's
first four days, making it the fastest-selling home video game console
yet. The company was able to meet the demand by having ample inventory
on hand in key markets. Preorders sold out across major retailers in
the US ahead of the launch. The threat of price increases from tariffs
likely boosted demand. Nintendo aims to sell 15 million Switch 2
consoles by the end of March 2026.
