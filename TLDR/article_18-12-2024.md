(SPONSOR) [4] 

 In an era where AI is reshaping how businesses operate, the journey
of building an early-stage startup [4] has never been more
dynamic—or complex. How do founders navigate finding product-market
fit, delegation, and scaling, all while adapting to technological
innovations?

Join on January 14 at 3pm PT [4] for a fireside chat with Christina
Cacioppo, CEO and Co-founder of Vanta, and Eric Ries, author of The
Lean Startup and Founder of LTSE, as they explore the journey of the
modern startup founder.

Eric and Christina will discuss:

 	* Learnings from their own experiences
 	* How the principles of “founder mode” and lean methodology
intersect
 	* The ways that today's AI-driven landscape shapes early-stage
growth and startup success

 NVIDIA INTRODUCES DEVICE AIMED AT SMALL COMPANIES, HOBBYISTS FOR AI
USE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nvidia is introducing a $249 version of its Jetson computer, which is
essentially a portable brain mostly designed to allow developers of
robots, industrial automation, and other hardware to run sophisticated
AI computations without connecting to a remote data center. The Jetson
lineup makes it easier for small companies, hobbyists, and students to
try creating new products that integrate AI functions. The $249 Orin
Nano Super nearly doubles the speed and efficiency of the previous
device and can process about 70% more computational tasks. Despite
trade restrictions, it will be available in China through local
distributors.

FREE (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Databricks has quietly become one of the fastest-growing startups in
Silicon Valley. It is now valued at $62 billion after securing $10
billion from investors. Databricks' software is used by data
scientists at some of the US' largest companies to analyze the large
volumes of information they collect. CEO Ali Ghodsi says the company's
success is thanks to the 'strategic surgeries' he performed to keep
the company healthy. This article looks at how Ghodsi turned the
company around and made it what it is today.

 CHINA ORBITS FIRST GUOWANG INTERNET SATELLITES, WITH THOUSANDS MORE
TO COME (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The first batch of 10 Internet satellites for China's Guowang
megaconstellation launched Monday on the country's heavy-lift Long
March 5B rocket. The fleet of up to 13,000 spacecraft will beam
low-latency high-speed Internet signals using an architecture similar
to SpaceX's Starlink network. China hasn't published many details
about the satellites other than their intended use as broadband
Internet relay stations. Guowang is managed by a secretive company
called China SatNet, which was established by the Chinese government
in 2021. 

 A TRANSPLANTED PIG KIDNEY OFFERS A GRANDMOTHER HOPE FOR LIFE WITHOUT
DIALYSIS (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Towana Looney, a 53-year-old grandmother from Gadsden, Ala,
volunteered to become the first living person in the world to get a
kidney from a new kind of genetically modified pig. Looney's operation
took place on November 25 and she seems to be in good condition. While
there are some risks to the procedure, such as the organs spreading
pig viruses to people, as well as other ethical concerns, the
technology may one day provide an unlimited supply of organs for
transplantation and save thousands of patients every year.

 “FOUNDER MODE” AND THE ART OF MYTHMAKING (47 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article presents a deep analysis of 'Founder Mode' from the lens
of another CEO. Brian Chesky could have reached a wider audience if he
had told his story in a different way. The way he told the story, the
problem was always everyone else, and the solution was always more
Brian Chesky, while ignoring the fact that Chesky created the problems
by being bad at running the business. Being a CEO is hard and making
mistakes is expected, but it's important to be able to hold yourself
accountable.

MANY OPEN POSITIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [12]

actively recruiting to expand but only backfilling some essential
roles.
