 IMMERSED IS BUILDING THE POST-SMARTPHONE DEVICE FOR THE FUTURE OF
WORK. IT'S JUST OPENED INVESTMENT TO PUBLIC (SPONSOR) [4] 

 While Big Tech struggles with VR adoption, Immersed has cracked the
code: 1.4M users spend up to 40-60 hours per week in their
productivity software - more engagement than any AR/VR app globally.

They've built the complete stack: the #1 productivity app on Meta's
Quest Store [4], plus upcoming Visor hardware that's 70% lighter and
70% less expensive than Apple Vision Pro. Backed by Google, Qualcomm,
and Intel [4], they've generated $7M revenue with $71M projected.

THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY: 8-16% discount with valuation caps of
$250M-$275M. Mass production starts this winter.

 META MIGHT BE MAKING ANOTHER SMARTWATCH, AND IT STILL HAS A CAMERA (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta is reportedly working on a smart watch designed to complement
both the company's smart glasses and Quest headsets. The device will
be able to see the world around the user through built-in cameras.
Meta planned to launch a similar pair of smartwatches in 2022. More
information about the project is likely to be revealed during the
company's annual developer conference, Meta Connect, set to kick off
on September 17. 

 MICROSOFT EDGE IS NOW AN AI BROWSER WITH LAUNCH OF ‘COPILOT MODE'
(5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft Edge's new Copilot Mode allows users to browse the web
while being assisted by AI. The AI can understand what the user is
researching, predict what they want to do, and then take action on
their behalf. It is still considered an experimental feature and is
opt-in by default. The feature is currently free for any Mac or PC
user with access to Copilot.

 ELECTRIC AIR TAXI FLIES FROM ONE AIRPORT TO ANOTHER AIRPORT (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A full-scale, piloted winged tilt-rotor eVTOL designed for commercial
service flew from one airport to another for the first time ever
earlier this month. Vertical Aerospace's vehicle flew 17 miles, during
which it reached speeds of 115 miles per hour and an altitude of 1,800
feet. The prototype has a fixed-wing configuration with eight
propellers. It was designed to accommodate one pilot and four
passengers or cargo and travel a maximum range of 100 miles. Video of
the flight is available in the article. 

 THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE YEAR CHINA STARTED CATCHING UP WITH
SPACEX (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 China's two biggest satellite internet networks have deployed less
than 1% of their planned satellites. One of the reasons for this slow
pace is China's lack of a reliable, reusable launcher. SpaceX's partly
reusable Falcon 9 rocket has propelled the company far ahead of its
competitors. While Starlink is intended for civilian use, it has
become essential for communications in war zones.

 SMALLER, SMARTER MODELS: MEET MELLUM FROM JETBRAINS & HUGGING FACE
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 In this livestream, you'll learn why small, task-specific LLMs might
outperform giant general-purpose models. JetBrains and Hugging Face
introduce Mellum, an open-source model for code completion [9], and
make the case for focal models that prioritize performance,
sustainability, and accessibility.

 GOOGLE'S LINUX TERMINAL PLAYS A BIG PART IN TURNING ANDROID INTO A
TRUE DESKTOP OS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google released a Linux Terminal app earlier this year, but only
recently published documentation for it. The app is aimed at letting
developers build Android apps directly on Android devices and will
eventually allow users to run full-fledged graphical Linux apps and
games. This could eventually transform Android into a first-class
desktop platform that rivals macOS and Windows. The app currently
doesn't support ARM-based CPUs. 

 SIX PRINCIPLES FOR PRODUCTION AI AGENTS (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Building effective AI agents is about system design and proper
software engineering. Focus on clear instructions, lean context
management, robust tool interfaces, and automated validation loops.
Look for missing tools, unclear prompts, or insufficient context when
debugging agents. Put error analysis first in the development process
- let models help understand where the agent failed, then
systematically address those failure modes. The goal isn't to create
perfect agents but to make reliable and recoverable ones that fail
gracefully and can be improved iteratively.

 AI IS EATING THE INTERNET (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Internet advertising gave us free content and services, and a mostly
open Internet. That is now collapsing with the advent of AI. Content
has now become training data for AI, unleashing a whole new wave of
crawlers on the web that often offer nothing in return. AI companies
repurpose the content they ingest and serve it directly to users
without sending them to the original source, breaking the ad-based
structure of the Internet. Content creators are rapidly fencing off
their gardens, putting up paywalls and anti-bot measures so aggressive
that users are having trouble accessing sites. Humans are retreating
to more intimate corners of the web, naturally gravitating to spaces
where real identity and authenticity are ensured. 

 WHY I'M GIVING UP MY DESIGN TITLE—AND WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT THE
FUTURE OF DESIGN (20 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The future will be increasingly augmented by AI. Designers need to be
closer to the development of the technology to help shape the systems
that will define how tomorrow's software is built. The industry needs
builders who understand agentic flows, designers who can reason about
trust boundaries and token windows, and researchers who can make
complex systems usable without dumbing them down to a chat interface.
Designers today have the tools to change the world with their ideas.
