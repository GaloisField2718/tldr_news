 SPACEX SCALES UP STARFACTORY, AIMING TO BUILD A STARSHIP A DAY (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX's Starfactory started construction back in February. The
upgrade gives Starbase an extra 100,000 square feet of factory floor
to help SpaceX reach its ambitious goal of producing one Starship a
day. SpaceX intends to start building Starship Version 2 at the new
Starfactory. Starship Version 2 is said to hold more propellant, have
improved reliability and a lower dry weight, and feature aerodynamic
changes. There are currently over 1,800 full-time employees at
Starbase. 

 SIRI IS REBORN IN IOS 18 ‚Äî EVERYTHING APPLE'S VOICE ASSISTANT WILL
BE ABLE TO DO (19 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Details about Siri's new functionalities as well as prompts that
Apple used to test the software have been leaked. Many of the prompts
used contain natural language, often detailing descriptions of what
the user is trying to do along with arguably superfluous details.
Several core apps, including Notes, Photos, Safari, and Mail, will be
getting enhanced Siri features in iOS 18. This article looks at all of
the enhanced Siri features coming in iOS 18 and other updates that can
be expected in iOS 18 and macOS 15.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 A REVOLUTION IN BIOLOGY (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article discusses different ways in which biology can be hacked
without gene editing. For example, scientists have used drug
combinations to create planarians with two heads or two tails. The
two-headed worms produce two-headed offspring indefinitely, meaning
that the scientists achieved a permanent change in the structure of
the worm - without changing its genes. Studies like this open up the
possibility of a perspective shift in how the body works. 

 ARS CHATS WITH PRECISION, THE BRAIN-CHIP MAKER TAKING THE ROAD LESS
INVASIVE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Competition is amping up in the brain-computer interface (BCI) space
as recent advances have the field buzzing with anticipation. Precision
Neuroscience is one of the startups at the forefront of the field. It
has placed its device on the brains of 14 human patients so far and is
hoping to at least double that number by the end of this year. The
company expected to have its first BCI on the market next year. This
article takes a look at the BCI space, Precision's device, how it
works, future designs, and more.

 SO YOU WANT TO BUILD A BROWSER ENGINE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This blog post contains advice on building a browser engine that's
competitive with Chromium. Focusing on the right set of imparted and
hard use cases will help a lot in the beginning. Some of these
constraining use causes include site isolation, content main thread
sanctity, fast JS-DOM calls, page load performance, and typing
latency. The post also contains ideas on how browsers can be improved
in general. For example, they could restore state after a browser
reset.

 BUILDING AI PRODUCTS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Just because AI gets things wrong sometimes doesn't mean it's
useless. AI models are extremely good at telling you what a good
answer to a question would probably look like. Generative AI is a
general-purpose technology, but developers are boxing it into
single-purpose tools and experiences. One of the reasons people are so
excited about large language models is that they could move through
all of the levels of software and hardware abstraction to the top. 

 NVIDIA'S NEW SALES BOOSTER: THE GLOBAL PUSH FOR NATIONAL AI CHAMPIONS
(6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Governments around the world are boosting their budgets to encourage
companies and multinationals to build new data centers and refit old
ones to develop AI locally and train large language models in their
native languages based on their own citizens' data. Nvidia says that
these sovereign AI efforts are expected to bring in almost $10 billion
this year. Many governments are concerned about how generative AI will
impact their economies. They want sovereign clouds for their AI
infrastructure and sensitive data, and US tech companies are eager to
build those for them.
