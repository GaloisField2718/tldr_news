 AI AGENTS IN CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE: HOW BILT ACHIEVED 70% TICKET
RESOLUTION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The agentic AI space still feels chaotic, overhyped, and hard to
navigate. But for businesses that get it right, AI agents are
reshaping customer experience.

Join Thatcher Foster, VP of Client Solutions at Bilt Rewards, and Max
Lowenthal, Agent Product Manager at Decagon, for a candid conversation
on Bilt's experience evaluating AI agents for customer support [4].

They'll look at what separates best-in-class agentic AI solutions from
legacy chatbot software, a five step checklist for evaluating AI
agents [4], deploying AI in a way that fits your workflows, and how to
measure ROI.

 GOOGLE IS FINALLY BUILDING ITS OWN DEX: FIRST LOOK AT ANDROID'S
DESKTOP MODE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google is developing its own Samsung DeX-like desktop mode for
Android. Samsung DeX is a software feature that emulates a desktop UI
that presents a desktop-like interface, allowing users to launch
multiple apps in floating windows and control everything with a
keyboard and mouse. The feature is still unfinished and almost
certainly won't launch by the release of Android 16. This article
presents a preview of the new desktop mode. 

 APPS LIKE KINDLE ARE ALREADY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF COURT-MANDATED IOS
APP STORE CHANGES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Amazon's Kindle app for iPhones and iPads wouldn't actually let
anyone buy books in the app, until yesterday. The iOS app still
doesn't allow books to be purchased directly in the app, but users can
search Amazon's virtual bookstore inside the app and tap a new button
that automatically pops them over to Amazon's website. Apple plans to
appeal the ruling to allow third-party developers to use alternate
payment processors in their apps - if successful, it could create new
potential PR headaches for Apple as the company would then be taking
away something from developers and users rather than preserving the
status quo.

 FAA GREEN-LIGHTS STARSHIP LAUNCHES EVERY OTHER WEEK FROM STARBASE (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Federal Aviation Administration has agreed to allow SpaceX to
substantially increase the number of annual launches from its Starbase
launch site in South Texas. SpaceX will now be able to conduct up to
25 Starship launches and landings during a calendar year. It will be
required to undertake dozens of actions to mitigate environmental
impacts. The company has yet to announce a firm date for its ninth
Starship flight test. 

 THE COMPANY WITH THE WORLD'S LARGEST AIRCRAFT NOW HAS A HYPERSONIC
ROCKET PLANE (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stratolaunch's Talon-A2 reusable hypersonic rocket plane has already
carried multiple experiments and delivered payloads. The company is
aiming for monthly flights by the end of the year and eventually wants
to ramp up to weekly flights. The Pentagon has spent about $12 billion
on hypersonic weapons development and testing since 2018 - none of the
weapons are operational yet. China's first hypersonic weapon became
operational in 2019, and Russia's government claimed it deployed a
hypersonic weapon in the same year. The Pentagon's hunger for
hypersonic weapons will likely fund Stratolaunch for some time to
come.

 GOOGLE'S GEMINI 2.5 PRO UPDATE MAKES THE AI MODEL EVEN BETTER AT
CODING (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google has released early access to a version of Gemini 2.5 Pro with
significantly improved coding capabilities. The model is reportedly
better at coding tasks such as building interactive web apps, code
transformation, code editing, and creating agentic workflows. It was
scheduled to debut at Google I/O, but Google released it early in
response to positive feedback. The updated Gemini 2.5 Pro is placed at
the top of the WebDev Arena Leaderboard and scored 84.8% on the
VideoMME benchmark. 

 INTRODUCING HYPER — A SIMPLE REACT ALTERNATIVE (DEVELOPER PREVIEW)
(10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Hyper is a simple markup language for building user interfaces that
enables developers to generate complex UIs with clean syntax. It is a
headless view layer focused on rendering. Hyper allows developers to
ditch the hundreds of frameworks, tools, languages, idioms, libraries,
and practices that attempt to solve problems within the idiomatic
React stack. This post compares React to Hyper.

Fraud (but more widely known as Scattered Spider) is suspected to be
