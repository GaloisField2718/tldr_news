 GOOGLE SAYS IT IS ‘GRADUALLY ROLLING OUT' OPTION TO CHANGE YOUR
@GMAIL.COM ADDRESS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google is gradually rolling out the option to change a Gmail address
to a new one (up to three times) with an altered username. Users'
original email address will still receive emails and work for sign-in.
Users will be unable to change or delete their email within 12 months
of each change. The support page detailing the update is currently
only in Hindi. 

 CHATGPT'S NEW FORMATTING BLOCKS MAKE ITS UI LOOK MORE LIKE A TASK
TOOL (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has quietly rolled out a new feature that tweaks ChatGPT's
layout to match the UI of the task it is supposed to execute. The new
'formatting box' mini editor toolbar pops up when users highlight text
inside ChatGPT's newer rich-text areas. It shows drafts as formatted
documents so users can edit them as they would in any document editor.
A screenshot of the feature is available in the article.

 US REGULATORS APPROVE WEGOVY PILL FOR WEIGHT LOSS (5 MINUTE READ) [7]


 A pill version of Wegovy has been approved in the US to treat
obesity. The ability of oral pills could expand the market by
broadening access and reducing costs. The pills are expected to be
available within weeks. The starting dose will be available for $149
per month from some providers. Additional information on cost will be
released in January. 

 NASA WILL SOON FIND OUT IF THE PERSEVERANCE ROVER CAN REALLY
PERSEVERE ON MARS (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Perseverance arrived on Mars nearly five years ago. At the time, NASA
had planned a mission to retrieve samples collected by the rover as
soon as 2026, but now, no such mission is set to launch until the
2030s. Perseverance appears to be in good condition and should be able
to operate for many years to come. The rover will continue filling
sample tubes in the expectation that they will eventually come back to
Earth.

 URL PATTERN API (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The URL Pattern API defines a syntax that is used to create URL
pattern matchers. Patterns are specified using the URLPattern
interface with a pattern syntax based on the syntax from the
path-to-regexp library. They can contain capturing groups that extract
parts of the matched URL. The API works across all of the latest
devices and browser versions. 

 RUBY 4.0.0 RELEASED (23 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ruby 4.0 introduces Ruby Box and ZJIT and adds many improvements.
Ruby Box is a feature that provides separations about definitions.
Definitions loaded in a box are isolated in the box. ZJIT is a new
just-in-time compiler developed to raise the performance ceiling and
encourage more outside contributions. It is faster than the
interpreter, but not yet as fast as YJIT.

 AMAZON FACES ‘LEADER'S DILEMMA' — FIGHT AI SHOPPING BOTS OR JOIN
THEM (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Amazon is using its subsidiaries to experiment with shopping agents
as it continues to contemplate how to deal with them. While the
company may be willing to let agents access its catalog, it likely
wants to protect more valuable data, such as reviews, from its
competitors. Its homegrown AI tools have improved since they first
launched. Amazon is now testing an agent that can purchase products
from other sites directly in its e-commerce app. 

 WHEN ROBOT TAXIS GET STUCK, A SECRET ARMY OF HUMANS COMES TO THE
RESCUE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Waymo vehicles become stranded if a human doesn't close the door
behind them at the end of a ride. Riders and passerbys are unreliable,
so Waymo summons help through an app called Honk, paying workers $20
or more for rescuing a robotaxi by closing a door. Last weekend's
power outage in San Francisco resulted in a severe gridlock throughout
the city, causing a flurry of requests for tow-truck companies to
retrieve Waymo vehicles. These are examples of how, as automation
advances, it can create new work for humans to fix errors.
