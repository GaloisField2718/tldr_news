 THE WINDOW TO INVEST IN THIS EMERGING TECH STARTUP IS CLOSING
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Where were you when Amazon acquired Ring for $1B? Or when Google
bought Nest for a cool $3.2B?

Hopefully, you were invested in those promising startups. But for
those that missed out, there's still a chance to get in on the action
with RYSE.

Their automated window shade tech just launched in +100 Best Buy
stores with a deal similar to the ones that led Ring and Nest to their
billion-dollar buyouts. But hurry, THEIR SHARE PRICE HAS ALREADY GROWN
20% from their last round and the current offering ends in 2 weeks
[4].

Missed out on Ring and Nest? This is your chance to secure your stake
in the smart home market.

2 weeks left to invest - learn more here. [4]

 TIKTOK PREPARING A US COPY OF THE APP'S CORE ALGORITHM (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 TikTok is working on a clone of its recommendation algorithm for US
users. This may result in a version that operates independently of its
Chinese parent, which may make it more palatable to lawmakers who want
to ban it. Work on the project started before the bill to force a sale
of TikTok's US operations began gaining steam in Congress this year.
While the project could lay the groundwork for a divestiture of
TikTok's US assets, the company has no plans to sell its US assets. 

 SPACEX SENT STARSHIP TO ORBIT ‚Äî THE NEXT LAUNCH WILL TRY TO BRING
IT BACK (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX's Starship's next test flight could be on June 5. The main
objective of the test will be to evaluate the second stage's reusable
heat shield as the vehicle tries to safely reenter the atmosphere for
the first time. Composed of around 18,000 ceramic hexagonal tiles, the
heat shield is vulnerable to even the loss of a single tile in most
places. SpaceX still needs to receive a commercial launch license from
the US FAA before the launch can move ahead.

 ‚ÄòSMART' ANTIBIOTIC CAN KILL DEADLY BACTERIA WHILE SPARING THE
MICROBIOME (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Gram-negative bacteria are often hardy, virulent, and quick to evolve
resistance to antibiotics. Scientists have developed an antibiotic
that kills pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria without impairing the gut
microbiome. Still untested in humans, the compound's usefulness will
depend on whether the bacteria will develop resistance to it in the
long run. The time from an antibiotic's discovery to its approval for
clinical use can be more than two decades, and there is not much money
to be made with a novel antibiotic - around ten to twenty new
Gram-negative antibiotics have been discovered in the past decade but
none have gained approval from the US FDA. 

 1-BIT LLMS COULD SOLVE AI'S ENERGY DEMANDS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Large language models are demanding more and more energy and
computational power as they get better. These models need to shrink to
become cheap, fast, and environmentally friendly. Researchers use a
process called quantization to compress networks by reducing the
precision of their parameters. They are now pushing the envelope to
single bit, producing models that are faster and more energy efficient
than their full-precision counterparts. The quantized versions of the
models perform almost as well as their original versions.

 UNEXPECTED ANTI-PATTERNS FOR ENGINEERING LEADERS (32 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Engineering teams consisting of a couple hundred people might cost
$50 to $100 million a year in salary, so it is frustrating for
executives when they hear that engineering is an art and that outcomes
are unpredictable. The misalignment between engineering leaders and
other executives often stems from a lack of flexibility - too many
well-meaning engineering leaders go by the book of conventional
leadership advice. Applying rules too universally turns them into
anti-patterns. The key to effective leadership lies in figuring out
which scenarios are worth deliberately defying conventional logic and
when to simply follow the rules. 

 DON'T DRY YOUR CODE PREMATURELY (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Before applying DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), consider whether the
deduplication is truly redundant or if the functionality will need to
evolve independently over time. Applying DRY principles too rigidly
leads to premature abstractions that make future changes more complex
than necessary. While two sections of code may look the same, they
could serve different contexts and business requirements that evolve
separately over time. Keep code separate until enough common patterns
emerge over time to justify coupling the code together. Tolerate a
little duplication in the early stages of development and wait to
abstract.

 CHASING UTOPIA, STARTUP STYLE (32 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Silicon Valley's tech barons have several projects to develop new
frontiers for human life. The projects are based on the desire to
withdraw from existing societies and their high taxes and regulations.
Stemming from a yearning for new forms of self-governance and
citizenship, these political exit projects illuminate the real
problems of society, like the failure of nation-states to respond
adequately to modern crises, disintegrating social cohesion, and the
epidemic of loneliness. While the idea of being a sovereign individual
may sound appealing to Silicon Valley billionaires, the world's most
poor and desperate often experience such lawless locales as
antithetical to freedom as some of the worst abuses flourish in the
absence of the state. 

 GOOGLE WILL ROLL OUT CHROME'S NEW EXTENSION SPEC NEXT WEEK (1 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Google will begin phasing out Manifest V2 on the Chrome Beta, Dev,
and Canary channels starting on June 3. Extensions will still work,
but Google says it will disable them in browsers in the coming months
before removing the ability to use them completely. A full rollout is
scheduled for the beginning of 2025. Manifest V3 has faced pushback
over concerns it could limit the effectiveness of ad blockers. Google
has attempted to address developers' main concerns by adding support
for user scripts and increasing the number of rule sets for an API
used by ad blocking extensions.
