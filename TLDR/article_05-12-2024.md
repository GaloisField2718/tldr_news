 COMPLIANCE FOR STARTUPS: DOWNLOAD THE CHECKLIST (SPONSOR) [4] 

 As a startup founder, finding product-market fit is your top
priority. But landing bigger customers requires SOC 2 or ISO 27001
compliance [4]—a time-consuming process that pulls you away from
building and shipping.

That's where Vanta comes in. Join over 9,000 companies, including
hundreds of Y Combinator-backed startups like Supabase, Newfront, and
Fern who streamline compliance with Vanta's automation and trusted
network of security experts.

Vanta's SOC 2 compliance checklist [4] breaks down the process into
clear steps—so you can spend less time on compliance and more time
growing your business.

 AMAZON ROLLS OUT BUY WITH AWS BUTTON TO LET SOFTWARE VENDORS MORE
EASILY SELL TO ITS CLOUD CUSTOMERS (4 MINUTE READ) [6]

make it easier for buyers to make purchases of third-party cloud
software using their AWS credentials. The button was created to
increase customer and partner loyalty and win rates. Software

 GOOGLE'S DEEPMIND TACKLES WEATHER FORECASTING, WITH GREAT PERFORMANCE
(5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google DeepMind claims that its GenCast system outperforms
traditional computing methods of weather forecasting out to at least a
week and often beyond. GenCast merges some computational approaches
used by atmospheric scientists with a diffusion model, resulting in a
system that maintains high resolution while cutting the computational
costs significantly. It has relatively low computational requirements,
so individual academic research teams will likely be able to
experiment with it. 

 GPS-ALTERNATIVE TECH SWAPS SATELLITES FOR EARTH FINGERPRINTS (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Australian firm Advanced Navigation and European missile manufacturer
MBDA are developing a new navigation system for planes to replace GPS
in situations where the system fails, such as when signals are
intentionally jammed by enemy forces. Their system uses a
downward-facing neuromorphic camera to read the terrain's
'fingerprint'. This data is cross-referenced against an existing
database of fingerprints, allowing the aircraft to ascertain its exact
geographical location. The system is reportedly simple enough that it
doesn't use any AI. The companies have planned a real-world
demonstration of its system later this year in Australia followed by a
commercial rollout of the technology.

 A FIRST LOOK AT S3 (ICEBERG) TABLES (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AWS' S3 Tables brings native support for Apache Iceberg to S3. This
post takes a look at the new offering, which is an exciting
development for the data analytics ecosystem. S3 has now launched
three major features in 12 months, suggesting that something material
has shifted in S3's development culture. The fact that AWS chose to
call the new feature 'S3 Tables' and not 'S3 Iceberg' could mean that
the company is open to supporting other table formats in the future. 

 FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE NEW AMAZON NOVA LLMS (VIA A NEW LLM-BEDROCK
PLUGIN) (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Amazon's new large language models are mainly competitive with the
Google Gemini family. They are extremely inexpensive and can handle
quite large contexts. The two larger models can handle images, video,
and PDFs. This article takes a look at the Amazon Nova family of
models, specifically its pricing and capabilities, how to access the
models from the terminal, and how to use multi-modal prompting with
images and documents.

 HOW TO GROW PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS (20 MINUTE READ) [12]

framework for measuring professional relationships and where one
stands in those relationships. The framework outlines seven states,
moving from a competitive, zero-sum mindset to one of shared identity.

best when we are collaborating well with others. 

 SAM ALTMAN DOWNPLAYS THE DANGERS OF A.I. AND MUSK (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Sam Altman says that AI technology will be able to mirror human
capability sooner than most people realize, but that this would matter
much less than many have predicted. He recently claimed that the
company would be able to achieve artificial general intelligence in
the next few years at a conference in New York City. He has downplayed
the rising tensions between him and Elon Musk, especially concerning
due to Musk's increasingly close relationship with President-elect
Trump, saying that it would be profoundly un-American to use political
power to hurt competitors and advantage Musk's own businesses.
