 HUMANOID ROBOTS ARE LOUSY CO-WORKERS. CHINA WANTS TO BE FIRST TO
CHANGE THAT (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Chinese startup UBTech is training human-like robots to sort auto
parts and move containers. The AI-powered robots can work with other
robots and figure out on their own how to get the job done - and also
learn how to do it better. It currently takes two of UBTech's robots
around 12 seconds to load a container onto a truck together, compared
to three seconds for human workers, but the robots are expected to get
faster and they can work around the clock. The startup plans to
deliver 500 to 1,000 of its robots to clients this year.

 GEMINI 2.5 PRO VS. CLAUDE 3.7 SONNET: CODING COMPARISON (11 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Gemini 2.5 Pro, an experimental thinking model from Google, has
become the talk of the town since its release. It is better at coding,
has a one million token context window, and it's free. While Claude's
3.7 Sonnet is not that far behind, at this point, there's no point in
using it over Gemini 2.5 Pro. Gemini 2.5 Pro has now taken the lead as
the default answer to every model comparison.

Airflow pipelines using decorator-based tasks. It can be used to
define tasks that call language models to process text, organize
straight multi-step AI reasoning, automatically parse and validate
outputs, and change the control flow of a DAG based on output. The SDK
supports all models in the Pydantic AI library.
