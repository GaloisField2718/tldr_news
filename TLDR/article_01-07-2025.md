 Meta Superintelligence Labs will house Meta's various teams working
on foundation models. It will be led by some of the company's most
recent hires, including Scale AI ex-CEO Alexandr Wang and former
GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. Meta plans to start research on its next
generation of models to get to the frontier in the next year or so.
This article has the full internal memo that Mark Zuckerberg released
yesterday - it contains a list of the company's recent hires. 

 APPLE HAS AN INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS ROADMAP FOR SMART GLASSES AND
HEADSETS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is currently working on three Vision series products and four
smart glasses variants. The company reportedly views head-mounted
devices as the next major trend in consumer electronics. An upgraded
version of the Vision Pro headset with an M5 chip is scheduled to
enter mass production in the third quarter of 2025. Apple plans to
launch a substantially lighter headset in the third quarter of 2027.
An upgraded Vision Pro with a new design, lighter body, and lower
price point will not be released until after the second half of 2028.

 AMAZON IS ON THE CUSP OF USING MORE ROBOTS THAN HUMANS IN ITS
WAREHOUSES (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amazon will soon have as many robots as humans working at its
facilities. The company has deployed more than one million robots in
its workplaces. 75% of Amazon's global deliveries are assisted in some
way by robotics. The growing automation has helped Amazon improve
productivity and deal with heavy staff turnover at its fulfillment
centers. 

 THE SECOND LAUNCH OF NEW GLENN WILL AIM FOR MARS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Blue Origin's second launch of New Glenn may carry NASA's ESCAPADE
mission, which includes a pair of small spacecraft that will be sent
to Mars to study its magnetosphere. The mission will launch no earlier
than August 15, but some say that a launch in late October or November
is more likely. The Mars mission was originally supposed to be on New
Glenn's first flight in October 2024, but it was taken off the flight
due to uncertainty about the launch date - the two spacecraft needed
to be launched within a certain time period. With a launch this fall,
the spacecraft should reach Mars in 2027.

 THE NEW SKILL IN AI IS NOT PROMPTING, IT'S CONTEXT ENGINEERING (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Context engineering is the art of providing all the context needed
for a task to be plausibly solved by a large language model. Context
is everything a model sees before it generates a response - this can
include prompts, data in memory, retrieved information, available
tools, and definitions for structured output. The secret to building
truly effective AI agents is to provide quality context. 

 TAIL LATENCY MIGHT MATTER MORE THAN YOU THINK (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Tail latency, or high-percentile latency, refers to high latencies
that clients see fairly infrequently. Modern architectures tend to
have a lot of components, so these rare instances of latency can still
have a large impact. This article looks at the different ways tail
latency can affect projects. Developers should be aware of service
latency and consider monitoring common customer or client use cases
for their end-to-end latency experience.

 OPENAI REPORTEDLY SHUTS DOWN FOR A WEEK AS ZUCK POACHES ITS TOP
TALENT (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI is shutting down for an entire week to force its staff to rest
and recharge. The shutdown is being framed internally as a much-needed
break. The company appears to be in 'panic mode' as Meta recently
poached several high-value employees. Its decision to pause for a
wellness week feels less like a perk and more like damage control. 

 APPLE WEIGHS USING ANTHROPIC OR OPENAI TO POWER SIRI IN MAJOR
REVERSAL (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple is considering sidelining its own in-house models and using AI
technology from Anthropic or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri. It
has asked both companies to train versions of their models that could
run on Apple's cloud infrastructure for testing. Switching to a
third-party provider for Siri would be an acknowledgment that Apple is
struggling to compete in generative AI. Apple's investigation into
third-party models is at an early stage and the company hasn't made a
final decision on using them.
