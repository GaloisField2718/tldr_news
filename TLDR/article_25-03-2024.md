 ELON MUSK CLAIMS NEURALINK ALREADY ALLOWING BLIND MONKEYS TO SEE
AGAIN (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 According to Elon Musk, Neuralink's 'Blindsight' product is already
working on monkeys to restore vision. The resolution is pretty low,
but researchers are looking for ways to increase the clarity of
images. It is unclear whether the monkeys were born blind and how much
of their optic nerves were still intact. The device could be made
available to far more people if Neuralink was able to bypass both the
eye and the optic nerve.

 216. UNITED STATES V. APPLE (54 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The US Department of Justice, 16 states, and the District of Columbia
are suing Apple for abusing its market position illegally under the
Sherman Antitrust Act. The process will likely take up to a decade or
more to complete, even though a settlement or withdrawal is possible
at any time. This article takes an in-depth look at the case and makes
predictions on its outcomes. A link to the filing is available in the
article. 

 CUDA IS STILL A GIANT MOAT FOR NVIDIA (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Nvidia controls both its GPUs and CUDA, giving it a killer advantage.
CUDA makes it easy to reap the benefits of the hardware that Nvidia
makes. One of the reasons for Nvidia's dominance is its years and
billions of dollars in investment into the CUDA ecosystem. It may be
possible in the future for competing projects to take over, but it
will take quite a while for the impacts of Nvidia's heavy long-term
strategy to go away.
