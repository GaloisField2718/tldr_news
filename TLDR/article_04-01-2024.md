 LEAKED VIDEO SHOWS BROWSING SAFARI IN APPLE VISION PRO IS SUPER
SMOOTH (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The latest rumors suggest that the Apple Vision Pro is launching by
the end of February. Recently leaked videos show how much multitasking
users can expect to accomplish with Apple's Safari web browser inside
of visionOS. Safari on the Apple Vision Pro lets users place multiple
windows and tabs in 3D space inside of the headset, creating a fully
customizable work experience. The leaked videos are available in the
article. 

 META'S CTO CALLS ITS AR GLASSES PROTOTYPE "THE MOST ADVANCED THING
WE'VE EVER PRODUCED AS A SPECIES" (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta plans to possibly unveil an AR glasses prototype in 2024 that it
claims is the most advanced piece of technology on the planet in its
domain. The device is still prohibitively expensive to manufacture and
there is still a lot of work to be done to reduce the price and form
factor. Meta may be working on a version of the Ray-Ban Meta
smartglasses with a small viewfinder display. AI breakthroughs and the
integration of AI into the current Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses have
significantly affected Meta's product roadmap.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE TWO CHINESE LABS WORKING ON REPLICATING LK-99 APPEAR TO HAVE
FOUND A ROOM-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTOR (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Chinese labs working on replicating LK-99 findings have discovered a
superconductor that works at -23 C. While it is not exactly a
room-temperature conductor, it is still a significant discovery.
Similar materials have been discovered previously, but they require
high pressure to exhibit their superconducting properties. The labs'
results have already been replicated. 

 MOBILE ALOHA (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Mobile ALOHA is a system for imitating mobile manipulation tasks that
are bimanual and require whole-body control. It is able to
autonomously complete complex mobile manipulation tasks such as
cooking, opening doors, and much more. This thread contains a video
showing a robot with Mobile ALOHA cooking a Cantonese recipe. Mobile
ALOHA is low-cost and open-source.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 THE AHA STACK (WEBSITE) [11] 

 The AHA stack combines Astro, htmx, and Alpine.js to create modern
web applications with a simple set of mental models and workflows. It
features a thin client, a simple yet awesome backend, a lightweight
frontend, and a declarative approach. The AHA stack is minimalist and
uses as few dependencies as possible. 

 SIEVE IS SIMPLER THAN LRU (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Caching involves storing temporary data for quick access. Eviction
algorithms determine what data to keep and what to discard. SIEVE is a
simple and effective cache eviction algorithm with just one queue. It
can also serve as a cache primitive for designing more advanced
eviction policies. SIEVE is not scan-resistant, so it can sometimes
show a higher miss ratio than other tools.

 THE PROTOCOL FORCE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The protocol force encourages the layer between consumers of value
and producers of value to be as thin as possible. IP, HTTP, and HTML
are great examples of this effect. The protocol force minimizes the
cost of reaching as many consumers or producers as possible. This
force is present in any layered stack that has producers and consumers
as outer layers. One of the key challenges of designing versatile
tools is that this middle layer is constantly tested and often broken.


 WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN 2024 (6 MINUTE READ) [14]
