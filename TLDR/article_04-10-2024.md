 INSIDE ELON MUSK'S AI PARTY AT OPENAI'S OLD HEADQUARTERS (8 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk laid out his vision to beat closed, for-profit AI during a
recruitment party for xAI held the same day OpenAI was hosting its
annual Dev Day across town. Musk had co-founded OpenAI with Sam Altman
and a group of partners in 2015, but he quit the board three years
later due to a potential future conflict with Tesla's focus on AI and
disagreements with the OpenAI team. He founded xAI to create a digital
superintelligence, assembling a team drawn from his other companies.
This article takes a look at what happened at the recruitment party,
where Musk called on developers to join the company to help build the
intelligence and applications derived from that intelligence. 

 OPENAI LAUNCHES NEW ‚ÄòCANVAS' CHATGPT INTERFACE TAILORED TO WRITING
AND CODING PROJECTS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has introduced an interface for interacting with ChatGPT
called 'canvas'. The feature allows users to generate text and then
highlight sections of the text to have the model edit. It is now
available in beta to ChatGPT Plus users - Enterprise and Edu users
will receive it next week. OpenAI plans to offer the feature to free
users once it is out of beta.

 CERN CONFIRMS ULTRA-RARE PARTICLE TRANSFORMATION, HINTS AT NEW
PHYSICS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers at CERN have established, experimentally observed, and
measured the decay of a charged kaon particle into a charged pion and
a neutrino-antineutrino pair. This specific kind of decay is
incredibly rare but well predicted by the complex mathematics making
up the Standard Model of physics. Its rarity and precision makes it a
highly sensitive gauge for detecting new physics. 

 NASA IS WORKING ON A PLAN TO REPLACE ITS SPACE STATION, BUT TIME IS
RUNNING OUT (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 NASA will finalize a strategy for its operations in low-Earth orbit
after 2030 over the next several months. It will award contracts to
one or more private companies to develop small space stations towards
the end of next year. These space stations will make NASA and other
space agencies customers rather than operators. The plans are still
developing and there are still many questions left unanswered, such as
whether NASA really needs to continue having a presence in low-Earth
orbit at all.

train large-scale models. It covers parallelizing and memory-saving
tricks, how to communicate state between these GPUs as quickly as

 SOLVING THE MAKER-TAKER PROBLEM (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The imbalance between major contributors and those who contribute
minimally harms open source communities. This, along with a lack of an
environment that supports the fair coexistence of open source
businesses, could discourage entrepreneurs from starting open source
businesses, which could harm the future of open source. Solving these
challenges by creating a more equitable and sustainable open source
ecosystem would help strengthen the future of open source. 

 PAY FOR JOB CHANGERS ROSE AT THE SLOWEST PACE IN MORE THAN 3 YEARS (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The median year-over-year pay increase for job switchers has fallen
and is now at its lowest growth rate since April 2021. The gap between
pay gains for job changers and job stayers is at its narrowest since
January and a far cry from the levels seen during the 2022-2023 'Great
Resignation'. This indicates that the labor market is currently less
dynamic. The slowdown could characterize the labor market data for the
rest of 2024 as quits and layoffs remain low.
