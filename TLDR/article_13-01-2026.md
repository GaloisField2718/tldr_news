MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Nvidia plans to invest $1 billion over five years in a new laboratory
with Eli Lilly. The facility, to be built in Silicon Valley, will
bring Lilly's lab expertise close to the center of AI innovation. It
will help AI engineers learn what it takes to run lab equipment and
research tasks. Nvidia plans to make its suite of AI models and agents
tailored for the healthcare industry open source, so anyone will be
able to tinker with the technology and adapt it to their needs. 

 1X UNVEILS 1XWM WORLD MODEL FOR NEO ROBOT PLATFORM (1 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 1X has integrated its new video-pretrained world model, 1XWM, into
its NEO robot platform. The 1XWM model predicts robot actions by
generating text-conditioned video rollouts and then translating them
into motion commands through an Inverse Dynamics Model. It uses a 14B
parameter generative video model as a backbone, with inference
currently taking about 11 seconds per rollout. The method enables
faster adaptation to new tasks as it doesn't require tens of thousands
of robot demonstration hours.

 WHY WE BUILT OUR OWN BACKGROUND AGENT (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Inspect is a coding agent that closes the loop on verifying its work
by having all of the context and tools needed to prove it. It can run
tests, review telemetry, and query feature flags, and it visually
verifies its work and gives users screenshots and live previews. Each
session runs in a sandboxed VM with everything an engineer would have
locally. This post contains the spec for Inspect so anyone can
replicate the tool.

 THE AI-POWERED VEBLEN ECONOMY (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 We will still want human-sourced goods and services in the future.
Humans have been shown to be incredibly creative when manufacturing
scarcity for the purpose of playing status games. This ability is
increasing, and the trend is accelerating. Humans will be able to
create enough scarcity to employ people to produce artisan goods.

powering into AI infrastructure. Clark is one of Anthropic's
co-founders, and McKenzie and Patel have interviewed many people
across the industry.
