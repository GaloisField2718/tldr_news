READ) [16]

they want to continue scraping the site's data. The site is now
blocking companies that haven't signed agreements about how its data
will be used or not used. Companies like Microsoft, Anthropic, and

 80% OF DEVELOPERS ARE UNHAPPY. THE PROBLEM IS NOT AI, NOR IS CODING
(5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Stack Overflow's most recent annual Developer Survey showed that a
majority of developers hate their jobs. Reasons for the
dissatisfaction include failed expectations, technical debt, hustle
culture, bureaucracy, and uncertainty and fear when it comes to career
prospects. While most developers are in favor of using AI tools, many
don't consider the tools reliable. 70% of professional programmers
don't see AI as a threat to their work - many are instead worried
about the spread of misinformation and misguided tasks.
