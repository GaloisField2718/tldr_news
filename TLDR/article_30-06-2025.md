TLDR 2025-06-30

 AFTER 21 YEARS, BASECAMP REMAINS THE MOST REFRESHINGLY
STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY TO MANAGE PROJECTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 There's big investor money in project management. That's a big
incentive to make bloated, barely-useable products — designed to
tick boxes in a procurement manager's checklist.

Basecamp [4] has been bucking this trend for more than two decades.
It's famously no-nonsense, effective, and reliable [4]. It's designed
for smaller, hungrier businesses who just need to get things done.

And it's still going strong — without spending hundreds of millions
of VC dollars on marketing.

No superbowl ads. No tacked-on AI.

Just the features you need to manage projects — from chat (bye bye
Slack) to Kanban to docs.

 IT'S KNOWN AS ‘THE LIST'—AND IT'S A SECRET FILE OF AI GENIUSES
(15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mark Zuckerberg has spent months putting together a list of the most
talented engineers and researchers in artificial intelligence.
Recruits on the list typically have PhDs from elite schools and work
experience at places like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. Their
specialized knowledge is the key to cashing in on the artificial
intelligence revolution. Many of the candidates have taken meetings at
Zuckerberg's homes in Palo Alto and Lake Tahoe. This article looks at
some of the people on the list. 

 TESLA SAYS IT MADE ITS FIRST DRIVERLESS DELIVERY OF A NEW CAR TO A
CUSTOMER (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla routed a Model Y SUV from its Austin, Texas, Gigafactory to an
apartment building in the area on June 27 - its first driverless
delivery of a new car to a customer. The vehicle transversed public
roads, including highways, without a human in the driver's seat or
front passenger seat. Tesla did not say which version of its software
and hardware the vehicle had, but the company's Head of AI said that
the vehicle was exactly the same as every Model Y produced in the
Tesla factory. A video of the Model Y completing the delivery is
available in the article.

 SCIENTISTS LAUNCH WILD NEW PROJECT TO BUILD A HUMAN GENOME FROM
SCRATCH (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Synthetic Human Genome Project aims to write artificial human DNA
from scratch - the scientists behind the project are hoping that it
will answer fundamental questions about the human genome and transform
our understanding of health and disease. The technology could be used
to create new medical treatments like designer cell-based therapies
and virus-resistant tissue transplantation. The research team hopes to
be able to create the foundational tools, technologies, and methods to
allow researchers to create genomes from scratch over the next
half-decade. The project runs along a parallel research effort into
the social and ethical issues of creating human genomes in a lab. 

 7 PEOPLE NOW HAVE ELON MUSK'S NEURALINK BRAIN IMPLANT (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Neuralink has increased the number of patients with its N1 brain
implant to seven. The implant allows those with cervical spinal cord
injuries or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to control a computer
with their thoughts. Six of the seven are participating in a study
aimed at proving that the N1 implant, R1 surgical robot, and N1 User
App are safe and effective. The implant has enabled some of the
patients to work to help provide for themselves and their families
financially.

 VET (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 vet is a command-line tool that acts as a safety net for the risky
curl | bash pattern. It lets users inspect, diff against previous
versions, and lint remote scripts before asking for explicit approval
to execute. vet is a safer, more transparent way to handle remote code
execution. 

 SIRIUS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Sirius is a GPU-native SQL engine that plugs into existing databases
such as DuckDB via the standard Substrait query format without
requiring any query rewrites or major system changes. It currently
supports DuckDB and Doris, with support for other systems coming soon.
Sirius is under active development and several features are still in
progress. Its current limitations include data size limitations, row
count limitations, data type coverage, operator coverage, and a lack
of support for partially NULL columns.

 OPENAI REPORTEDLY ‘RECALIBRATING' COMPENSATION IN RESPONSE TO META
HIRES (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI's leaders have been working around the clock to talk to
employees who have received offers from Meta. Meta has successfully
poached a number of OpenAI's senior researchers. Eight researchers
have departed OpenAI for Meta over the past week. OpenAI has
recalibrated its compensation and is looking for creative ways to

 TRUMP SAYS HE HAS 'A GROUP OF VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE' TO BUY TIKTOK (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 President Donald Trump says he has a group of buyers willing to
acquire TikTok. A sale would need approval from the Chinese
government, but Trump has told the media that President Xi Jinping
'will probably do it'. It is unclear whether the current buyer is the
same as the one from three months ago - the deal fell apart in April
due to a disagreement on tariffs. The US Congress passed a law forcing
TikTok's sale in April last year, but the deadline for the sale has
been repeatedly delayed.
