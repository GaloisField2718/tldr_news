 APPLE READIES PAIR OF HEADSETS WHILE STILL LOOKING AHEAD TO GLASSES
(13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is developing two new Vision Pro headsets despite glasses being
a bigger goal in the long run. The company is also preparing to
overhaul iPadOS to make its tablets more like Macs. iPhones made in
China have been exempted from tariffs. Apple will not move production
back to the US - instead, it is going all-out on India as its US
production source. It would be impossible to move iPhone manufacturing
back to the US. 

 OPENAI IS REPORTEDLY PREPARING TO LAUNCH GPT-4.1 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is readying GPT-4.1 and a full version of its o3 reasoning
model for release soon. GPT-4.1, a revamped version of GPT-4o, will
launch along with smaller mini and nano versions. While OpenAI is
still not yet profitable, it is currently valued at $300 billion.
ChatGPT was the most downloaded app on app stores last month.

 WORLD'S FIRST INTERACTIVE 3D HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A team of Spanish engineers has created a 3D hologram that can be
physically interacted with. The technology allows users to control
holographic objects using common phone gestures. Users testing the
system were faster and more confident when manipulating objects
compared to existing methods. A video showcasing the technology is
available in the article. 

 EXPERIMENTAL DRUG LOOKS TO BE GASTRIC BYPASS SURGERY IN PILL FORM (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The popularity of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss has led to companies
competing to make new and improved anti-obesity medications.
Boston-based Syntis Bio has created a daily pill that mimics the
effects of gastric bypass without actual surgery. The drug is designed
to redirect the absorption of nutrients from the beginning of the
small intestine to its end, changing how the body absorbs food and
leaving people feeling fuller from eating less. Early data from
animals and a small group of humans shows that the pill is safe and
may be able to suppress hunger.

of a full-stack SPA framework to build reactive web applications. It

 NO CODE IS DEAD. LONG LIVE VIBE CODING (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 No- and low-code abstractions promised to democratize software
creation, but the technology didn't even come close to replacing code
or traditional programming. A decade later, vibe coding is showing
that prompt-to-code workflows are possible. Large language models
allow people to create actual code not locked into proprietary
runtimes. They can generate code written to open standards, leverage
industry best practices, and deploy to open infrastructure.

 WHAT'S WRONG WITH APPLE? (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 It's been a decade since the release of Apple's most recent
commercial successes - the Apple Watch and AirPods. The company's
services lag behind rivals in subscriptions and half of its sales
still come from the iPhone. Vision Pro sales were disappointing, but
it was the company's issues with Apple Intelligence that exposed the
dysfunction within the organization. There seems to be a breakdown of
leadership, communication, and internal processes at Apple. 

 SAM ALTMAN AT TED TODAY (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI's user base has doubled in just the past few weeks. The
company plans to release a powerful open-source model near the
frontier in response to DeepSeek. It is becoming much less restrictive
on speech harms and taking a more permissive stance due to feedback
that people don't want censorship. Sam Altman says that having a child
changed a lot in him - but he doesn't think his kids will ever be
smarter than AI.
