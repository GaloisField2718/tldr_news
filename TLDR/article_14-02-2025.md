 TIKTOK IS BACK ON THE APP STORE AND THE PLAY STORE IN THE U.S. (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Both Apple and Google restored TikTok to their app stores in the US
on Thursday. Other ByteDance apps were also restored. President Trump
has said that he would like the US to own a 50% share in TikTok
through a joint venture with other tech companies. Competing social
networks have been trying to bank on TikTok's uncertain future by
releasing rival features and apps. 

 ELON MUSK'S FULL OFFER LETTER TO BUY OPENAI REVEALS FIVE KEY DETAILS
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk's offer to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion has a clear
deadline: May 10. There is a stipulation that the buyers are able to
examine OpenAI's financial and business records and interview OpenAI
staff before the all-cash transaction is finalized. The offer
undermines Musk's legal claims that OpenAI's startup's assets can't be
transferred away for private gain. Musk will drop the bid to acquire
OpenAI if the board commits to keeping it as a nonprofit.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 BRAIN IMPLANT THAT COULD BOOST MOOD BY USING ULTRASOUND TO GO UNDER
NHS TRIAL (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The UK's Advanced Research and Intervention Agency (Aria) is funding
a trial to test a brain-computer interface that directly alters brain
activity using ultrasound to boost mood. The technology could
revolutionize the treatment of conditions such as depression,
addiction, OCD, and epilepsy by rebalancing disrupted patterns of
brain activity. The device was developed by a US-based non-profit
called Forest Neurotech. The trial will recruit patients who have had
a part of their skull temporarily removed so that the device can be
tested without having to perform surgery. It will run for three and a
half years starting in March, and if successful, the device will move
into full clinical trials. 

 AVRIDE LAUNCHES SIDEWALK DELIVERY BOTS ON UBER EATS IN JERSEY CITY (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Uber is expanding its partnership with Avride to include autonomous
deliveries in Jersey City. Customers in the city can now have their
orders delivered by one of Avride's autonomous sidewalk delivery
robots. Avride's first robotaxi deployment in the US will be in Dallas
this year. The startup has also partnered with Grubhub to bring
delivery bots to university campuses across the US.

 AI-DESIGNED ENZYMES (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 One of the ultimate aims of protein design is to build entirely new
enzymes from scratch. Scientists have traditionally discovered enzymes
in nature and then adapted them through trial and error. New advances
in AI may eventually lead to ways to create bespoke enzymes from the
ground up, but doing so remains a formidable challenge. Many of the
protein structural databases used to train models consist
overwhelmingly of structures gleaned from 'frozen' images, preventing
them from making accurate recreations of dynamic structures. 

 HOW I AUTOMATED MY COMPUTER ROUTINE WITH MACOS FOLDER ACTIONS (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It's possible to use macOS folder actions to automate various tasks,
including converting MOV to MP4 and images to WEBP, downloading videos
from YouTube, and more. This article explains how to set these
automations up. macOS folder actions turn folders into an interface
for any CLI app, making the desktop even more useful than ever.

 ARM IS LAUNCHING ITS OWN CHIP THIS YEAR WITH META AS A CUSTOMER (1
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Arm has signed Meta as a customer and will start making chips this
year. The first in-house Arm chip will be unveiled as early as this
summer. The semiconductor company usually licenses its chip
blueprints, so making its own chips is a notable change in strategy.
This will turn some of Arm's existing customers into competitors. 

 MY MODEL OF WHAT IS GOING ON WITH LLMS (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 People seem to be confused about what can be concluded about scaling
large language models. At this point, it is not plausible to precisely
predict how far we are from unlocking all of the remaining functions
that large language models are capable of. We don't even know all of
the component functions of human intelligence - every time we solve
something previously out of reach, it turns out that human-level
generality is even further out of reach. The invention of human-level
artificial general intelligence will disrupt history, but that point
is still pretty far off.
