 GPT-5′S ROLLOUT FELL FLAT FOR CONSUMERS, BUT THE AI MODEL IS
GAINING WHERE IT MATTERS MOST (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 GPT-5's rollout wasn't about the consumer - it was OpenAI's effort to
crack the enterprise market. Startups like Cursor, Vercel, and Factory
have already made GPT-5 the default model in certain key products and
tools due to its faster setup, better results on complex tasks, and
lower price. OpenAI has built out an enterprise sales team with more
than 500 people. Enterprise demand is rising sharply, especially for
planning and multi-step reasoning tasks. 

 EVERY APPLE SECRET THAT LEAKED YESTERDAY (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple accidentally included hardware identifiers in software code
linking to numerous unannounced products in a major slip on Wednesday.
The information provided concrete evidence that Apple is currently
developing a new HomePod mini with an S-series processor, a new Apple
TV with an A17 chip, the Apple Studio Display 2, a new iPad mini with
an A19 Pro chip, a new low-cost iPad with an A18 chip, an Apple Vision
Pro with an M5 chip, and a new Apple Watch chip. Apple is also
currently developing a Ring-like security camera, an iPad-style smart
home hub, and a tabletop robot companion with a movable display.

 NASA HAS SPARKED A RACE TO DEVELOP THE DATA PIPELINE TO MARS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NASA's relay spacecraft are still healthy, but they were never meant
to be permanent. The agency's Space Communications and Navigation
program is looking for solutions to augment these aging assets. It
aims to create an interoperable marketplace where NASA can be one of
many customers instead of the owner-operator. The program has
requested capability studies for a 'lunar trunkline' between the Moon
and Earth and end-to-end Mars communications that move data from
assets on the surface, through Mars orbit, and to operations centers
on Earth. 

 AI DESIGNS ANTIBIOTICS FOR GONORRHOEA AND MRSA SUPERBUGS (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A team at MIT has used generative AI to design antibiotics that could
kill drug-resistant gonorrhea and MRSA. The leading designs were
tested on bacteria in the lab and on infected mice. They still need to
go through a process of refinement before human studies can begin. The
work demonstrates a novel approach with enormous potential for
identifying new antibiotics. While AI promises to dramatically improve
drug discovery and development, safety and efficacy testing processes
are still required.

 BACK TO BEING FOSS, REDIS DELIVERS A NEW, FASTER VERSION (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Redis 8.2 is now generally available - the previous FOSS release,
version 7.2, will reach its scheduled end-of-life date at the end of
February. It introduces over 14 new performance and efficiency
improvements. Organizations still using Redis 7.2 will need to either
move to Valkey or upgrade to a new major version of Redis. Redis 7.8
will endure until May 2027, but it isn't strictly FOSS. 

 5 USEFUL CSS FUNCTIONS USING THE NEW @FUNCTION RULE (10 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 CSS functions just landed in Chrome 139. The capability helps
developers write more organized and dynamic CSS. CSS functions can run
logic - they accept arguments and return new values. Using custom
functions makes code much neater. This article looks at some
real-world examples of where CSS functions can come in handy. While
Chrome is currently the only browser to have shipped the feature, CSS
functions has gone through the CSSWG draft process, so other browsers
should be implementing it soon.

 NEW TREND: EXTREME HOURS AT AI STARTUPS (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Extreme working hours have long been rejected in the US because
excessive hours tend to lead to burnout and other health issues in the
long term. Despite that, more AI startups are increasing their hours,
with some firms expecting staff to work more than 80 hours per week.
These extreme hours are justified by a sprint to achieve Artificial
General Intelligence in just a matter of months. These working hours
will likely stay - the fear of missing out is very strong across the
industry. 

 FACEBOOK IS DEAD; LONG LIVE META (21 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The days when Meta's self-identification as a social network caused
them to miss fundamental shifts in the Internet are over. Meta used to
talk about connection, but it has now switched to talking about
empowering the individual. Facebook has transformed from a platform
that connects people into a diverse global provider of entertaining
and informative content. Being a social network was ultimately
unsustainable, and Meta is now stronger than ever.
