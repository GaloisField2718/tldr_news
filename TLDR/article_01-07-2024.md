MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple is reportedly planning to begin mass production of new AirPods
with camera modules by 2026. The new AirPods will feature an infrared
camera that will integrate with Vision Pro and future Apple Vision
headsets to enhance the user experience of spatial audio and
strengthen the spatial computing ecosystem. The system may detect
environmental image changes to enable in-air gesture control. Apple is
also exploring other wearable form factors such as smart glasses and a
smart ring.

integration this fall. Possible candidates include Google's Gemini and

 MONSTER 310-MILE AUTOMATED CARGO CONVEYOR WILL REPLACE 25,000 TRUCKS
(3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Japanese government plans to connect major cities with automated
zero-emissions logistics links. There are plans to complete an initial
link between Tokyo and Osaka by 2034. The system will be designed to
quietly and efficiently shift millions of tons of cargo while getting
tens of thousands of trucks off the road. Japan's population collapse
may mean it will have logistics issues by 2030 due to a lack of
workers.

 ASK HN: WHAT IS THE BEST CODE BASE YOU EVER WORKED ON? (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [12] 

 A discussion about the best code bases developers have worked on and
what made them so good. Good code bases are well organized and easy to
navigate and understand. The process behind developing the code base
is important too - a good team and well-thought-out planning process
helps a lot in creating good code.

 THE BEST SOCIAL MEDIA SITE STILL LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE IN THE 1990S
(12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Craigslist has remained largely the same over the years. The site has
been extremely profitable throughout its existence - even without
implementing sophisticated recommendation algorithms or flooding its
pages with third-party advertisements. It remains a household name
despite the many newcomers entering the market. This article looks at
the site and its unique take on social media. 

 WHAT SCOTUS JUST DID TO BROADBAND, THE RIGHT TO REPAIR, THE
ENVIRONMENT, AND MORE (25 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The administrative state touches everything in the US like net
neutrality, climate change, clean air and water, and consumer
protections. Since 1984, the administrative state has largely run on
one Supreme Court precedent: Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council. This law enabled federal agencies to deal with issues
that legislators have yet to cover. The decision has now been
overturned. It is still unclear what the repercussions of this change
may result in - it could completely change the ways courts review
agency rulemaking.
