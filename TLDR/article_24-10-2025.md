TLDR 2025-10-24

 PLAID RESEARCH SHOWS CONSUMERS TRUST THEIR FINTECH APPS - AND EXPECT
MORE OF THEM (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Plaid and The Harris Poll surveyed 2,000+ consumers [4] to find out
what they actually expect from fintech in 2025. Users trust digital
tools to help them navigate murky economic waters - but expectations
are rising as well:

→ 77% say their bank must connect to their apps.

→ 57% expect AI features in fintech apps.

→ 80% see the benefits of paying by bank over cards.

The Fintech Effect 2025 [4] breaks down eight major trends, from open
banking expectations to AI adoption to alternative payments. Find out
what you should build next, and where AI fits (also: where it
doesn't).

 GOOGLE AND ANTHROPIC ANNOUNCE CLOUD DEAL WORTH TENS OF BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic now has access to up to a million of Google's
custom-designed Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) thanks to a new deal
worth tens of billions of dollars. The deal is expected to bring well
over a gigawatt of AI compute capacity online in 2026. Anthropic
spreads its workloads across vendors, letting it fine-tune for price,
performance, and power constraints. Google's TPUs offer Anthropic
strong price-performance and efficiency. 

 NETFLIX, AMAZON, AND APPLE ARE REPORTEDLY INTERESTED IN BUYING WARNER
BROS. (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is launching a 'review of strategic
alternatives to maximize shareholder value' due to multiple offers for
both the entire company and Warner Bros. Netflix, Amazon, Apple,
Paramount, and Comcast are reportedly interested in buying WBD as a
whole or acquiring pieces of the company. WBD already announced plans
to split its cable TV and streaming businesses next year.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE GAME THEORY OF HOW ALGORITHMS CAN DRIVE UP PRICES (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Intentional price-fixing through collusion has long been illegal.
Sellers are increasingly relying on algorithms that repeatedly adjust
prices in response to new data about the state of the market. It is
much harder to ensure these algorithms set fair prices as there is no
explicit collusion. Algorithms can collude tacitly even when not
programmed to do so. One way to fix this problem is to ban all pricing
algorithms except the no-swap-regret algorithms that game theorists
favor. There are methods for checking if an algorithm has a
no-swap-regret property without looking at its code, so there are
practical ways of enforcing this idea. 

 OPENAI-LINKED CREATIVE STUDIO RAISES $12 MILLION AS IT EYES AI
CONTENT DRIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Wonder Studios, an AI creative studio backed by OpenAI and DeepMind
executives, has raised $12 million in seed funding to expand its
production. The funding will be used to double the company's
engineering team and accelerate a push into intellectual-property
ownership and original content production. The round was led by
European venture capital firm Atomico. Wonder Studios plans to release
a number of commercial and original productions next year.

 LOVART LAUNCHES FAST MODE FOR 80% QUICKER DESIGN GENERATION (SPONSOR)
[9] 

 Lovart, the world's first design agent [10], is taking off with
millions of users and 8-figure ARR. Its new Fast Mode speeds up output
by 80%, orchestrating models such as Sora 2, nano Banana, and Veo 3.1
to turn prompts into brand-ready visuals in minutes. See how it works
⚡️ [10]. 

 WORKFLOW DEVKIT (WEBSITE) [11] 

 The Workflow DevKit makes any TypeScript function durable. It allows
developers to build apps and AI agents that can suspend, resume, and
maintain state with ease. The dev kit is easy to set up as it works
with already existing frameworks. It is open source and portable by
design. 

 A SINGLE DNS RACE CONDITION BROUGHT AMAZON'S CLOUD EMPIRE TO ITS
KNEES (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Amazon has published a detailed postmortem that explains the recent
day-long outage that disrupted major websites and services. The root
cause was a race condition in DynamoDB's automated DNS management
system that left an empty DNS record for the service's regional
endpoint. The race condition occurred when one DNS Enactor experienced
'unusually high delays' while the DNS Planner continued generating new
plans. AWS has disabled the DynamoDB DNS Planner and DNS Enactor
automation worldwide until safeguards are put in place.

 I AM OUT OF DATA HELL (26 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 If you're competent and you put some amount of effort into
demonstrating that competence, you can free yourself from the world of
recruiters. If you can generate even half of what you need to live by
yourself, you've doubled the amount of time you'll survive without
conventional employment. Sales is just looking at someone's problem
and giving them a quote for fixing it. Being in control of your work
means being able to tell customers they aren't a good fit. 

 REASONING IS NOT MODEL IMPROVEMENT (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The AI coding tool market is scaling explosively, with all the
companies betting on the assumption that models will keep getting
better at generating code. The entire market becomes a house of cards
if that assumption is wrong. However, whoever solves the architecture
problem wins everything. Even modest fundamental improvements would
cascade through the entire ecosystem. The question is whether any lab
will prioritize the hard path of fixing the foundation over the easy
path of building apps.
