 OPENAI STARTS ROLLING OUT ITS HER-LIKE VOICE MODE FOR CHATGPT (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has started to roll out its advanced voice mode to a small
number of ChatGPT Plus subscribers. The feature was previously
criticized for sounding similar to Scarlett Johansson and was delayed
for safety reasons. OpenAI has implemented four preset voices trained
with voice actors. The new mode will likely be available to all
ChatGPT Plus users in the fall.

 NEURALINK RIVAL SYNCHRON'S BRAIN IMPLANT NOW LETS PEOPLE CONTROL
APPLE'S VISION PRO WITH THEIR MINDS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Neurotech startup Synchron has connected its brain implant to Apple's
Vision Pro headset, allowing patients with limited physical mobility
to control the device using only their thoughts. The company is
building a brain-computer interface to help patients with paralysis to
operate technology with their minds. It has implanted its device in
six patients in the US and four in Australia. The device still needs
approval from the US Food and Drug Administration before it can be
commercialized more broadly.

 MAKE SOFTWARE SIMPLE AGAIN (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The software industry is more driven by profit and unnecessary
complexity than by the ability to build and launch innovative
products. Companies can save a lot of money by leaving the cloud. The
old pricing model where users pay once for software rather than
through monthly subscriptions can be very appealing to customers, but
it makes it more difficult to scale a company if customers only pay
once. A lower bar to entry for solo developers and small teams will
allow more ideas to get the opportunity to prosper.

 CROWDSTRIKE'S IMPACT ON AVIATION (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 An update to a sensor configuration by CrowdStrike on July 19 caused
the largest IT outage in history. The outage affected many industries
- this article looks at its impact on the US aviation industry. Delta
was hit the hardest, followed by United, and to a significantly
smaller degree, American. Southwest didn't appear to be affected by
the outage at all. Delta took an extended time to recover and had to
cancel thousands of flights in the days following the CrowdStrike
update. 

 AMAZON MUST RECALL DANGEROUS PRODUCTS PROPERLY ‚Äî EVEN ONES SOLD BY
THIRD-PARTIES (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has ruled that Amazon, not
third-party sellers, is responsible for properly recalling hazardous
items sold on its marketplace. Amazon failed to adequately notify the
public about more than 400,000 recalled products sold between 2018 and
2021. The company downplayed the severity of hazards, telling
customers about 'potential safety issues' rather than explicitly
labeling recalls. Amazon now has a page dedicated to recalls that
allows users to view product recalls and safety information for items
they bought on Amazon.
