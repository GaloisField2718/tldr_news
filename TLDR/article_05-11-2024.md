 APPLE LAUNCHES NEW INTERNAL STUDY FOCUSED ON BUILDING SMART GLASSES
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple has been conducting internal studies on building smart glasses.
Apple often gathers secret groups when it has plans to launch a new
category of product to collect feedback from. The company prefers to
use employees for these studies in order to keep its plans secret. It
will be years before Apple will have its smart glasses ready for
consumers - until then, the company will be working on a cheaper
version of the Apple Vision Pro and a second-generation device with a
faster chip. 

 OPENAI'S O1 MODEL LEAKED ON FRIDAY AND IT IS WILD — HERE'S WHAT
HAPPENED (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is set to unveil the full version of its o1 model sometime in
the next few weeks. The model was briefly accessible by changing a
parameter in the URL, but this has since been fixed. An OpenAI
spokesperson said that OpenAI experienced some issues while it was
preparing for limited external access to the o1 model. Examples of
outputs from the model made while it was accessible are available in
the article.

 PLANT-ANIMAL HYBRID CELLS MAKE SOLAR-POWERED TISSUES, ORGANS, OR MEAT
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists in Japan have created hybrid plant-animal cells - animal
cells that can gain energy from sunlight like plants. The team
inserted chloroplasts sourced from red algae into animal cells
cultured from hamsters and found that the cells continued to perform
photosynthetic functions for at least two days. The cells grew faster
than usual when cultured alongside chloroplasts, suggesting that the
chloroplasts were providing a new carbon source. The study's findings
could have major benefits for lab-grown tissues, such as artificial
organs, artificial meat, and skin sheets. 

 CHINA REVEALS A NEW HEAVY LIFT ROCKET THAT IS A CLONE OF SPACEX'S
STARSHIP (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 China has been revising its Long March 9 rocket over the last decade
in response to the development of reusable rockets by SpaceX. The
design now looks almost exactly like SpaceX's Starship rocket. China
intends to fly the vehicle for the first time in 2033. The Chinese
space industry recognizes that the future of space flight is fully
reusable, so it is re-calibrating its projects to align more with
SpaceX's designs.

includes a preview of a new Grok model that is in the final stages of
development. It has a context length of 128,000 tokens and supports
function calling and system prompts. A new vision model will be
available next week. Users signing up to the public beta program will
receive $25 of free API credits per month.

 I'VE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART REGARDING EMPLOYEE METRICS (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The job of a manager is to know what their reports are up to and
whether they're doing a good job or are generally effective. A manager
that can't do that is themselves ineffective - which is the
responsibility of their manager and so on up the line. Improving
employee metrics tooling won't help managers do their jobs better if
they aren't able to notice what is going on. Managers can end up
relying on these tools too much instead of doing their jobs properly. 

 REGULATORS DELIVER SUCCESSIVE BLOWS TO AMAZON AND META'S NUCLEAR
POWER AMBITIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Amazon and Meta's plans for building data centers near nuclear power
plants to fuel its electricity needs have run into regulatory
roadblocks that have nothing to do with nuclear power itself. Meta's
data center faces issues due to the sighting of a rare bee species on
the land. Amazon's plans were blocked as it could cause other
customers of the nearby nuclear power plant to suffer lower
reliability and higher costs. Microsoft's plans to revive a reactor at
Three Mile Island are still moving ahead.
