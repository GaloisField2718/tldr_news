 ANDROID 16 COULD GIVE GEMINI THE POWER OVER APPS ASSISTANT NEVER GOT
(4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google is working on an API for Android 16 that will let system apps
perform actions on behalf of users inside applications. The API will
be guarded by a permission granted to the default assistant app. Apps
will be able to create functions by defining a service that can only
be bound by a system process. Details on the new API are scarce, but
it appears it will allow Gemini to control apps in a way that Google
Assistant never managed to do. 

 AMAZON'S MOONSHOT PLAN TO RIVAL NVIDIA IN AI CHIPS (20 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Nvidia has transformed from a niche chipmaker to the main supplier of
the hardware that enables generative AI over the past two years. The
demand for the chipmaker's latest hardware will outstrip supply for
several quarters. Nvidia's biggest customers, which include cloud
providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, are eager to
reduce their reliance on - or replace - Nvidia's chips. This article
looks at Amazon's chip development journey and how it plans to compete
with Nvidia.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 TWEAKING NON-NEURAL BRAIN CELLS CAN CAUSE MEMORIES TO FADE (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Astrocytes, non-neuron brain cells, can be artificially manipulated
to suppress or enhance specific memories while leaving all other
memories intact. These cells play various roles in the brain, many
focused on the health and activity of their neighboring neurons.
Scientists hope to be able to develop an astrocyte-targeted treatment
for disorders such as PTSD. 

 A STUDY SAYS GRAY HAIR MAY BE REVERSIBLE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have discovered one of the causes of gray hair: stuck
stem melanocyte stem cells. The cells usually travel between
compartments of developing hair follicles. They can't make the protein
needed to pigment hair when they get stuck, unable to move back to the
germ compartment. Making them move again could result in the
production of pigment and the return of colored hair.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 ZERO DISK ARCHITECTURE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The idea of Zero Disk Architecture is simple: instead of writing to a
storage server, write instead to S3. This means you won't have to
manage any storage server - this is all offloaded to AWS. The cost and
latency of S3 are both going down as the technology improves. While
there are still some tradeoffs to consider, Zero Disk Architecture can
be very attractive for systems that don't care about latency. 

 FOURSQUARE'S 104M POINTS OF INTEREST (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Foursquare recently made its Points of Interest dataset freely
available. This post looks into the dataset. Foursquare was likely
earning a good amount of revenue from the dataset as there isn't a lot
of competition from the freely available data sets. Companies that
produce these datasets can charge yearly rental fees that run into the
six-figure territory.

 BLUESKY IS ON THE VERGE OF OVERTAKING THREADS IN ALL THE WAYS THAT
MATTER (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Bluesky app has exploded to 3.5 million daily active users. Its
user base has increased by 300% since Election Day. Journalists,
academics, and companies are fleeing X and going to Bluesky instead of
Threads possibly due to Threads' decision to downplay political
content on the platform. Bluesky is quickly becoming the platform for
political and cultural debate. 

 AMAZON TO INVEST ANOTHER $4 BILLION IN ANTHROPIC, OPENAI'S BIGGEST
RIVAL (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Amazon is investing an additional $4 billion into Anthropic. Its
total investment into the artificial intelligence startup is now $8
billion. Amazon will retain its position as a minority investor.
Anthropic will use Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud and
training partner.
