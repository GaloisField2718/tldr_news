(SPONSOR) [4] 

 When the former Zillow exec who sold his first company for $120m
starts a new venture, people notice. _Thousands_ of people.

In fact, 12,000+ regular investors have already joined the early
investors behind Uber, eBay, and Venmo as early-stage Pacaso
investors. [4]

Disrupting the real estate industry once again, Pacaso's streamlined
platform offers co-ownership of premier properties, revamping a $1.3T
market.

And it works. Pacaso has already made $110M+ in gross profits [4] in
less than 5 years. They even recently reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO.

And you can become a Pacaso shareholder right now. Just hurry. Invest
before this opportunity ends on Thursday night. [4]

 TIKTOK BUYERS TO INCLUDE ORACLE, SILVER LAKE, AND ANDREESSEN (7
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to
discuss a deal where TikTok's US operations would be acquired by a
consortium that includes Oracle, Andreessen Horowitz, and Silver Lake.
The framework would create a US-based version of the app. ByteDance
will license the technology behind its recommendation algorithms.
Trump has postponed the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's US
operations until December 16 to buy time for the transaction to be
completed.

 DAILY WEIGHT LOSS PILL CAN HELP CUT BODY WEIGHT BY A FIFTH, TRIAL
SHOWS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Eli Lilly's weight loss pill, orforglipron, can help people reduce
their body weight by as much as a fifth. The drug targets the same
GLP-1 receptors as weight loss injections such as Mounjaro and Wegovy.
While the weight loss seen in people taking the tablet is not as stark
as that seen in those taking injectable forms of the drug, the tablet
is significantly more accessible and convenient. Eli Lilly expects
substantial demand when the new pill is launched. 

 HOW SPACEX TURNED A TEXAS MARSH INTO THE WORLD'S MOST WATCHED
SPACEPORT (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SpaceX's Starbase, a massive rocket development site and the home of
Starship, started as little more than an impossible stretch of empty
land along the South Texas coast. The degree of difficulty of
transforming the site did not deter Elon Musk, so the company tackled
its issues one by one. This article looks at how the company
transformed the land into Starbase and the challenges that it overcame
along the way.

 HOW TECH COMPANIES MEASURE THE IMPACT OF AI ON SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
(48 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 85% of software engineers are using AI coding tools at work, but
things like tokens aren't exactly cheap, so companies need to know how
to measure whether or not they are worth the money. This article looks
at how some tech companies measure AI impact to uncover insights on
how to get started in this tricky field. Solid foundations matter.
Have an experimental mindset when measuring AI impact. 

 IF ALL THE WORLD WERE A MONOREPO (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 R's central package manager, CRAN, builds each package before
publication, testing against a variety of R versions and operating
systems. Even if a package passes tests against the full matrix of R
versions and platforms, CRAN still reruns the tests for all of the
packages that depend on that package. This means some packages can be
blocked until dependent packages are upgraded. This approach, which
clearly puts a burden on package developers, results in an excellent
workflow for R's central user base, who want to spend as much time as
possible on the details of data analysis, not stuck in transitive
dependency hell.

 JACK MA RETURNS WITH A VENGEANCE TO ‘MAKE ALIBABA GREAT AGAIN' (11
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Jack Ma is now back on Alibaba's campuses and is more directly
involved than he's been in half a decade. He had resigned as chairman
in 2019 and retreated from the public eye after a speech he made in
2020. The company has been run by two of Ma's longest-serving
lieutenants, Joe Tsai and Eddie Wu, since 2023. Signs of Ma's
influence can be seen in the company's pivot to artificial
intelligence and its declaration of war on e-commerce foes JD and
Meituan. 

 MODS REACT AS REDDIT KICKS SOME OF THEM OUT AGAIN: “THIS WILL BREAK
THE SITE” (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Reddit is rolling out new rules that mean that users will not be able
to moderate more than five subreddits with 100,000 monthly visitors. A
small number of moderators will be required to leave their posts due
to the new rules. Reddit says the change will help enable diverse
perspectives and experiences. Moderators will be able to seek
exemptions.
