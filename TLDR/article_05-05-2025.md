 WELCOME TO STARBASE: TEXAS HAS A NEW CITY HOME TO ELON MUSK'S SPACEX
(4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A vote to decide whether to turn part of south Texas into a new city
centered around Elon Musk's SpaceX passed with broad support, paving
the way for a newly incorporated city made up almost exclusively of
SpaceX employees and people connected to the company. The brand-new
city, Starbase, covers about one and a half square miles at the
southern tip of Texas in a coastal spot nestled against the Mexico
border. It is home to SpaceX headquarters and where the company builds
its boosters and engines and launches its Starship rocket on test
flights. Having greater municipal control of the area could ease some
of the bureaucracy and restrictions around SpaceX's tests and rocket
launches. 

 ERIC SCHMIDT APPARENTLY BOUGHT RELATIVITY SPACE TO PUT DATA CENTERS
IN ORBIT (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Eric Schmidt acquired Relativity Space to have the capability to
launch a significant amount of computing infrastructure into space.
Schmidt appeared before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce
during a hearing in April and spoke about the need for more
electricity to power data centers to facilitate the computing needs
for AI development and applications. Space-based data centers would be
powered by solar panels and be able to radiate heat into the vacuum of
space. Relativity's Terran R will be capable of launching 33.5 metric
tons to low-Earth orbit in expendable mode and 23.5 tons with a
reusable first stage.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 WORLD FIRST: JAPAN CLAIMS NEW DRONE CAN INDUCE LIGHTNING STRIKES (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone group claims to have created a
drone that can induce and guide lightning strikes. The technology
could theoretically be used to protect cities and infrastructure from
lightning damage. A wire is attached to the drone - when a switch is
flicked, a surge of electrical energy runs through the wire, grounding
the drone electrically. This allegedly increases the strength of the
drone's surrounding electric field, triggering and attracting a
lightning strike. A video that explains how the technology works is
available in the article. 

 AFTER 856 'SNAKE BITES', MAN'S BLOOD COULD UNLOCK UNIVERSAL ANTIVENOM
(4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Venom expert Tim Friede has voluntarily injected himself with snake
venom 856 times across 18 years. This has led to the creation of the
most widely effective snake antivenom on record. The antivenom
protected mice from the venom of 19 different snake species in lab
experiments. Rigorous clinical testing is required before the
antivenom will be made available to humans. The researchers plan to
conduct field trials of the antivenom to treat snake-bitten dogs in
Australia.

 APPLE AND ANTHROPIC REPORTEDLY PARTNER TO BUILD AN AI CODING PLATFORM
(1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apple and Anthropic have partnered to build a new version of Xcode
that will use Anthropic's Claude Sonnet model to write, edit, and test
code. Apple plans to roll out the software internally and hasn't
decided if it will launch it publicly. The latest Claude models have
been particularly popular for coding tasks. 

 PIPASK (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 pipask is a drop-in replacement for pip that performs security checks
before installing a package. It relies on metadata from PyPI whenever
possible. pipask asks for consent first if third-party code execution
is necessary. It uses pip to handle the actual installation if the
installation is approved.

 WE FINALLY KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT AMAZON'S SUPER-SECRET SATELLITES
(4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Amazon finally launched the first production satellites for its
Kuiper broadband network last week. The company has been secretive
about the project since it was unveiled in 2019. The designs of the
satellites remain unknown, but a fuzzy video released by Amazon on
Friday revealed enough to make out their trapezoidal shape. The mass
of each Kuiper satellite is estimated to be somewhere between 1,185
and 1,259 pounds. 

 FUTUREHOUSE RELEASES AI TOOLS IT CLAIMS CAN ACCELERATE SCIENCE (2
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 FutureHouse has launched four AI tools (Crow, Falcon, Owl, and
Phoenix) designed to support scientific work. Crow can search
scientific literature and answer questions about it, Falcon can
conduct deeper literature searches, Owl looks for previous work in a
given subject area, and Phoenix uses tools to help plan chemistry
experiments. The Eric Schmidt-backed nonprofit aims to build an 'AI
scientist' within the next decade. Its tools still make mistakes,
which may make scientists wary of endorsing them for serious work.
