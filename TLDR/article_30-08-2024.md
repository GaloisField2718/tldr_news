 APPLE, NVIDIA ARE IN TALKS TO INVEST IN OPENAI (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple and Nvidia are in talks to invest in OpenAI as part of a
fundraising round that would value OpenAI at above $100 billion. It is
an unusual move for Apple, as the company doesn't usually invest in
startups. Nvidia has stepped up its investment activity in the past
two years, putting its money into AI-related companies. OpenAI is one
of the largest users of Nvidia's AI chips. 

 TESLA MODEL Y REFRESH PLANNED FOR Q1 2025, SUPPLY CHAIN REPORT CLAIMS
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A report from China claiming to use information from Tesla's supply
chain states that Tesla is planning a Model Y refresh in the first
quarter of 2025. Tesla is also reportedly planning to start production
of a 7-seat Model Y at Gigafactory Shanghai soon. It is expected to be
an upgraded version of the US seven-seater configuration for the Asian
and European markets. Most of the changes made to the Model 3 in last
year's refresh will make it to the new Model Y.

 INSIDE CHINA'S RACE TO LEAD THE WORLD IN NUCLEAR FUSION (17 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The Chinese government's current five-year plan makes comprehensive
research facilities for crucial fusion projects a major priority for
the country's national science and technology infrastructure. It is
estimated to be spending around $1.5 billion each year on fusion,
almost double what the US government allocated this year for this
research. The country has built itself from being a non-player 25
years ago to having world-class capabilities. Chinese scientists are
aiming to build a test reactor with the goal of producing up to 1
gigawatt of fusion power in the 2030s. 

 THE IMPACT OF AI/ML IN DRUG DISCOVERY ISN'T WHERE YOU THINK IT IS (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Decision making in biotech is ridiculously difficult. ML systems can
automate low- and medium-level decision making. These systems can
generate more data and better synthesize that data into decisions.
They are able to systematize human rational frameworks into
quantitative, interpretable, and scalable analytic engines. Enabling
model-driven decision making would require building an organization in
a data centric way with an engineering culture.

 ELASTICSEARCH IS OPEN SOURCE, AGAIN (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Elasticsearch and Kibana are now open source again. AGPL will be
added as another license option next to Elv2 and SSPL in the coming
weeks. Elastic changed its license 3 years ago to remove a lot of
market confusion, but the landscape has changed so it is able to
become open source again.

 CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSES CONTROVERSIAL ‚ÄúKILL SWITCH‚Äù AI
SAFETY BILL (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 SB-1047 passed the California State Assembly by a 45-11 vote. It now
faces just one more procedural state Senate vote before heading to the
governor's desk. The bill asks AI model creators to implement a 'kill
switch' that can be activated if a model starts introducing novel
threats to public safety and security. It has been criticized for
focusing on risks from an imagined future AI rather than real
present-day harms like deepfakes or misinformation. 

 SCALING LAWS, ECONOMICS, AND THE AI "GAME OF EMPERORS" (8 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The ROI on AI has been positive so far. Scaling laws may eventually
collide with economics - if they hold. If scaling laws hold and there
are no fundamental technology breakthroughs, then the models trained
in 2026/2027 are likely to require clusters that cost well over $100
billion. At that point, the ROI on AI may begin declining.
