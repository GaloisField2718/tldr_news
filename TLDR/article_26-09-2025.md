 TRUMP APPROVES TIKTOK DEAL THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER, VANCE SAYS
BUSINESS VALUED AT $14 BILLION (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday approving
a proposal that could keep TikTok alive in the US. The deal would
involve creating a new joint-venture company that will oversee
TikTok's US business. China has yet to approve the terms. No
representatives from ByteDance were present at the signing, and the
company has not acknowledged that a transaction is taking place. There
is no indication that the Chinese government has made changes to laws
that would be necessary for a deal to take place. 

 SPACEX WANTS TO FLY ITS GIGANTIC STARSHIP DIRECTLY OVER FLORIDA (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX has proposed a flight path for its Starship rocket that would
see it fly across Florida skies. The route would seriously disrupt air
traffic and raise the risk of debris falling onto populated areas.
Starship's test flights have so far only taken the megarocket on
suborbital trajectories. SpaceX is preparing the rocket to reach low
Earth orbit and complete a full trip around the planet before
returning for a landing attempt.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 WORLD'S FIRST ‘BEHAVIOR TRANSPLANT' BETWEEN SPECIES ACHIEVED (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers from Nagoya University transferred the courtship behavior
from one species of fruit fly to another by manipulating a single gene
to create new neural connections. While both species of fly belong to
the same family, they have distinct neural circuits that drive very
different mating behaviors. The achievement was the culmination of
nearly a decade's work by several members of the Japanese team. It is
the first-ever example of humans manipulating a single gene to
transfer foreign behavior to another species. 

 THE REASON GENE EDITING HASN'T TRANSFORMED HUMAN HEALTH IS THAT
CURRENT GENE EDITING TECHNOLOGIES LIKE CRISPR ARE VERY LIMITED (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists at the Arc Institute have developed a new DNA editing
technology that can seamlessly write massive changes into the right
place in the human genome. Bridge RNAs in bacterial 'jumping genes'
allowed the scientists to make safe and arbitrary changes to every
nucleotide within (up to) a 1 million base pair sequence in human DNA.
They can be used to correct disease-causing DNA repeats in
Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's, and other repeat expansion
disorders.

 PostgreSQL has a new I/O subsystem that improves performance for
workloads of all sizes. Other features include virtual generated
columns, a database-friendly uuidv7() function, and easier integration

article. 

 INTRODUCING PERPLEXITY SEARCH API (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Perplexity Search API provides access to the same global-scale
infrastructure that powers Perplexity's public answer engine. It
allows developers to tap into information across the internet with one
simple yet powerful interface. Unlike other API offers, it provides
rich structured responses that are ready for use in AI and traditional
applications alike. Perplexity has released an SDK, an open-source
evaluation framework, and a deep dive into how its research team
designed, optimized, and evaluated the API.

 BECOMING A RESEARCH ENGINEER AT A BIG LLM LAB - 18 MONTHS OF
STRATEGIC JOB HUNTING (41 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Max Mynter signed as a research engineer with Mistral earlier this
week. The road to getting there was not an accident - Mynter had
strategically worked towards this outcome for an extended period. This
account of his personal experiences shares a few things that worked
out for him. Mynter's main tactic was to try to get an information
advantage and then act on this information to be prepared when it
matters. The preparation can involve strategic high-effort projects or
tactical quick-win initiatives. 

 THERE ARE MORE ROBOTS WORKING IN CHINA THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD
COMBINED (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 China has five times as many robots working in its factories as the
US. Until last year, China installed more imported robots in its
factories than domestically made ones - last year, nearly three-fifths
of the robots installed in the country were made locally. While
Chinese companies still lag behind foreign competitors in their
ability to manufacture some key components, China has a large number
of skilled electricians and specialized computer programmers who can
install robots, as well as an artificial intelligence industry that is
strongly focused on tracking and improving every aspect of factory
equipment performance.
