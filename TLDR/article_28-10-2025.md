 CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED TESTING
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 AMAZON TO ANNOUNCE LARGEST LAYOFFS IN COMPANY HISTORY, SOURCE SAYS (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Amazon is expected to start informing employees about sweeping job
cuts starting today. It plans to lay off as many as 30,000 staff
across its corporate workforce. The layoffs are part of a broader
cost-cutting campaign that started during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said earlier this year that the company's
workforce could shrink further as a result of generative AI. 

 OPENAI'S LESS-FLASHY RIVAL MIGHT HAVE A BETTER BUSINESS MODEL (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Anthropic gets about 80% of its revenue from corporate customers, of
which it has around 300,000. Its Claude language models have been
praised for their aptitude in coding. Anthropic is surprisingly close
to OpenAI in revenue. It expects to get to a $9 billion annual run
rate by the end of the year, a big lead in revenue per user over
OpenAI.

 SAM ALTMAN REPORTEDLY DEVELOPING NONINVASIVE BRAIN INTERFACE TO RIVAL
ELON MUSK'S NEURALINK (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Sam Altman's Merge Labs is a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup.
It recently hired an award-winning biomolecular engineer, Mikhail
Shapiro. Shapiro's past work suggests that the startup could be aiming
to create a device that could link to the brain using sound waves. If
Merge Labs is successful, its device may be preferable to Neuralink's
BCI as it wouldn't require surgery.

 EASY RISC-V (71 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This is an introductory tutorial to RISC-V assembly programming
intended for those with a basic familiarity with low-level computer
science concepts. RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture
started its life at UC Berkeley. It is an open standard with a clean
design that is quickly gaining steam and has found great success in
many areas of application. The tutorial covers the 32-bit bare bones
RV32I_Zicsr instruction set with a tiny subset of the privileged
architecture. 

 WHY IP ADDRESS TRUNCATION FAILS AT ANONYMIZATION (18 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Truncated IP addresses are still personal data under GDPR, especially
when combined with other information that most systems routinely
collect. Subnet size doesn't correlate with user anonymity. The
network prefix itself contains enough information for trivial
identification. Many organizations are creating compliance risks by
thinking IP truncation is GDPR-compliant anonymization. What is
actually needed is encryption specifically designed for IP addresses.

 MORE BIG COMPANIES BET THEY CAN STILL GROW WITHOUT HIRING (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Companies in the US are increasingly making the calculation that they
can keep the size of their teams flat, or even shrink them, without
harming their businesses. Part of this is the belief that artificial
intelligence will be used to automate more processes, but companies
are also hesitant to make moves in an uncertain economy. The
widespread caution in hiring is frustrating job seekers and leading
many employees within organizations to feel stuck in place. Operating
with fewer people can pose risks for companies by straining existing
staff or hurting efforts to develop future leaders. 

 MUSK'S WIKIPEDIA RIVAL SITE LIVE AFTER CRASHING ON LAUNCH DAY (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Grokipedia crashed shortly after it launched yesterday. It was live
late evening with nearly 900,000 articles. Many entries closely
resemble their Wikipedia counterparts, but Elon Musk's views shape how
some topics are framed. For example, his own Grokipedia page features
a 'Recognition and Long-Term Vision' section instead of Wikipedia's
'Accolades'.
