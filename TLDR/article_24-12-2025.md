Many of the things we struggle to program into computers can be
learned from data, but only when that data is
available. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌

 DELVE SHIPMAS DAY 3: AN AI BROWSER EXTENSION FOR ALL YOUR SECURITY
QUESTIONNAIRES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Welcome to Delve Shipmas. Every day this week, Delve is launching a
new AI feature to make compliance more modern than ever. Yesterday, we
launched the first-ever AI-native VRM platform. Today, we're
launching... AI SECURITY QUESTIONNAIRE CHROME EXTENSION.

You thought CSV's were bad. Then you opened your first platform
questionnaire and saw a 200-question surprise waiting for you. Today,
Delve is making that go away once and for all with our AI browser
extensions for security questionnaires! Delve's agent auto-extracts
all the questions, answers them based on your reports, policies, and
tech stack - direclty in your Chrome tab.

See why Bland, Wisprflow, Greptile, and over 1000 more trust Delve to
get and stay compliant with SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR and more.

Book a demo here [5] to see the AI extension in action and get $1,500
off compliance.

 MORAVEC'S PARADOX AND THE ROBOT OLYMPICS (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Many of the things we struggle to program into computers can be
learned from data, but only when that data is available. If we can't
learn from data, we are forced to program it in at lower performance.
Computers can learn any skill, but only with enough data, and we don't
want to have to need huge amounts of data for every single task. As
models get better, they will need less data to learn new tasks, and
when this happens, we'll finally be able to build truly general
methods that combine physical understanding and cognition. 

 MICROSOFT WANTS TO REPLACE ITS ENTIRE C AND C++ CODEBASE, PERHAPS BY
2030 (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Microsoft is hiring staff to translate its codebase from C and C++ to
Rust. It plans to combine AI and algorithms to rewrite its biggest
code bases. The engineer will be expected to work on the tools
Microsoft is building to complete the project. The candidate will have
to work three days a week in Microsoft's Redmond office. The role pays
between $139,900 and $274,700 a year.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SINGLE INJECTION TRANSFORMS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM INTO A CANCER-KILLING
MACHINE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An Australian team has discovered a way to transform normal T cells
into supersoldiers in the body. The treatment helped four people with
stubborn blood cancer go into remission for up to five months. The
trial marks a step towards the next revolution in CAR T therapy. CAR T
cells are usually made outside the body, and making them is costly for
both the body and wallet. The durability of the new therapy, its
longevity, and immune side effects still need to be studied, but the
trials highlight the promise of a one-and-done therapy for deadly
blood cancers. 

 THE ML DRUG DISCOVERY STARTUP TRYING REALLY, REALLY HARD TO NOT CHEAT
(LEASH BIO) (33 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Leash Bio is a Utah-based startup that aims to build big datasets of
small-molecules x protein interactions and train a model on it, then
use the trained model to design a drug. The startup has a nearly
pathological design to make sure its models are learning the correct
thing. The startup has produced a lot of interesting artifacts from
its line of research. This post looks at a few of the discoveries the
startup has made.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 INTERVIEWING FOR ML/AI ENGINEERS (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The ML Systems Design interview, as an interview type, is very easy
to do badly. Some companies run a parody of the Big Tech interview
process, while others clearly have thought deeply about what they
want, but they still don't conduct effective interviews. The interview
process should be robust enough to avoid being fooled by people who
are good at talking, but still accurate enough to calibrate the
candidate's level as well as willingness to push out-of-band offers.
The best pitch for a candidate is to present to them a slate of
talented and thoughtful interviewers who could be their future
co-workers, and an interview process rigorous enough to assure them
that their co-workers have been thoroughly examined. 

 ON FRIDAY DEPLOYS: SOMETIMES THAT PUPPY NEEDS MURDERING (6 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Deploy freezes are a workaround, not a virtue. It's possible to evade
the high-stakes peril of locks and freezes and terrifying recoveries
by freezing merges and letting people work on other things, and also
not freezing deploys unless your goal is to test deploy freezes. We
often forget about the outages and instability we trigger with our
inaction. Just run the deploy process as usual, but don't ship new
code out.

 STEAM, STEEL, AND INFINITE MINDS (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Every technological shift requires people to stop seeing the world
through the past and start imagining a new one. We are still trying to
build chatbots onto workflows designed for humans. What we should do
instead is to imagine what knowledge work could look like when the
busywork is delegated to minds that never sleep. The knowledge economy
is about to undergo a significant transformation. 

 WHAT JOBS ARE MADE OF (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Early-career roles are traditionally more execution-heavy. Over time,
contribution tends to shift toward judgment and agency. AI systems are
making faster progress on execution than on defining problems,
choosing what to work on, and navigating ambiguity. This
disproportionately affects entry-level hiring as the execution layer
becomes cheaper and thinner.
