 YOUR DATA MADE THEM BILLIONS—NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO PROFIT (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 🚨Open AI reached a valuation of $340 billion this year, all on the
back of your data.

The big data gold rush is here, but profits have been hoarded by AI
and tech giants… Until now.

Instead of hoarding data, Mode Mobile is sharing the profits from it,
all by TURNING YOUR SMARTPHONE INTO AN INCOME-GENERATING ASSET.
[4]Here's what that looks like:

 	* Paid over $325M to over $45M users.
 	* Generated 32,481% revenue growth.
 	* Previously ranked #1 FASTEST-GROWING SOFTWARE COMPANY [4] by
Deloitte.

📲Their _EarnPhone_ could be the biggest disruption to smartphones
since the iPhone, and they're gearing up for a potential IPO on the
Nasdaq (ticker: $MODE).

But the real opportunity is now, and you can still invest in Mode's
pre-IPO offering at just $0.26/share.

 INSIDE GOOGLE'S INVESTMENT IN THE A.I. START-UP ANTHROPIC (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google owns 14% of Anthropic. Its investment gives it little control
over the AI startup - Google holds no voting rights, no board seats,
and no board observer rights at Anthropic. Google is set to invest an
additional $750 million in Anthropic in September through a
convertible debt - it has invested more than $3 billion into the AI
company in total so far. It is only allowed to own up to 15% of
Anthropic. 

 OPENAI SAYS IT HAS TRAINED AN AI THAT'S ‘REALLY GOOD' AT CREATIVE
WRITING (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman claims that his company has trained a new
model that is 'really good' at creative writing. It is unknown how and
when the model will be released. OpenAI has previously focused on
challenges in the fields of math and programming rather than creative
writing. The company experimenting with writing suggests that the
latest generation of models has vastly improved on the wordsmithing
front.

 NASA LAUNCHES NEW SPACE TELESCOPE AND SUITE OF SOLAR SATELLITES (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SPHEREx and PUNCH lifted off from the Vandenburg Space Force Base at
11:11 PM ET on Tuesday. SPHEREx is a space telescope that will take
images of the entire sky in more than a hundred colors that are
invisible to the human eye. PUNCH is a suite of satellites that will
study the Sun's outer atmosphere and solar wind. This article gets
into the specifics of what the missions aim to do. 

 AUSTRALIAN MAN SURVIVES 100 DAYS WITH ARTIFICIAL HEART IN WORLD-FIRST
SUCCESS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An Australian man lived with a totally artificial heart for 100 days
before receiving a donor heart transplant in early March. The BiVACOR
total artificial heart uses magnetic levitation technology to
replicate the natural blood flow of a healthy heart. The implant is
still in the early stages of clinical study, but it looks to be a
promising alternative for patients who are unable to wait for a donor
heart or when a donor heart is simply not available. There is still a
long way to go before the artificial heart could be considered a
replacement for a heart transplant - the functioning time span of the
device is still significantly less than that of a donor heart.

 HERE'S HOW I USE LLMS TO HELP ME WRITE CODE (30 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Using large language models (LLMs) to write code is difficult and
unintuitive and there's little guidance to help people figure out how
best to apply them. The patterns that work well do not come naturally
to everyone. This post guides readers on how to achieve great results
when programming with LLMs. One of the biggest advantages of LLMs is
speed of development - LLMs enable developers to ship projects that
they previously wouldn't have been able to justify spending any time
on. 

 OPENAI PUSHES AI AGENT CAPABILITIES WITH NEW DEVELOPER API (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 OpenAI's new Responses API is designed to help software developers
create AI agents that perform tasks independently using the company's
AI models. It will eventually replace the Assistants API, which OpenAI
plans to retire in the first half of 2026. The Responses API can
access the same models that power ChatGPT Search. The technology still
has significant limitations, such as issues navigating websites and
models making factual mistakes. OpenAI has also released the Agents
SDK to provide developers tools to integrate models with internal
systems, implement safeguards, and monitor agent activities.

 Y COMBINATOR FOUNDERS RAISING LESS MONEY SIGNALS A ‘VIBE SHIFT,' VC
SAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There has been a 'vibe shift' from and of the founders in Y
Combinator's current batch - people want to achieve their dreams with
as little VC as possible. This wasn't due to a lack of interest by VCs
- the round was oversubscribed. It's becoming more common for YC
startups to raise less capital than was offered to them by investors.
Raising less means founders maintain a larger ownership stake in their
companies, giving themselves more ongoing business and exit options. 

 THE CREATORS OF THE LAS VEGAS SPHERE WANT TO OPEN SMALLER
MINI-SPHERES (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Sphere Entertainment is working on a design for mini-Spheres with a
capacity for about 5,000 people. Smaller investigations of the Sphere
could potentially attract a wider range of artists. Designing and
producing the custom video content required for the venue requires a
hefty investment from performers. There are no details on where or
when the mini-Spheres would be built. The company plans to build a
second full-sized Sphere in Abu Dhabi.
