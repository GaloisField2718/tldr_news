 YAHOO IS ADDING GENERATIVE AI TO ITS SEARCH ENGINE (1 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Yahoo Scout is a new AI-powered 'answer engine' powered by
Anthropic's Claude. It synthesizes information from the web and
Yahoo's own data when constructing responses to natural language
queries. The interface includes visible source links aimed at making
answers easier to verify. The engine behind Scout will become more
personalized as time goes on. 

 AMAZON TO SHUT DOWN ALL AMAZON GO AND AMAZON FRESH STORES (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Amazon is closing all Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh physical stores and
will shift its focus to online same-day delivery and expand its Whole
Foods market business. The Go and Fresh stores failed to deliver a
distinctive customer experience and couldn't be scaled up. Some of the
shuttered stores will be converted into Whole Foods stores. Amazon
plans to open 100 new Whole Foods stores in the coming years.

 AUTOMATING BIOLOGY (22 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Biology is wildly complex, and our understanding of biological
systems is just scratching the surface. Automating biology will
require significant investment to achieve exit velocity. However, once
we achieve it, we'll be able to explore the galaxies of genes,
proteins, and microbes living all around us. These developments will
pave the way for novel therapeutics that will improve health and
longevity, boost biomanufacturing, and more. 

 INTRODUCING HELIX 02: FULL-BODY AUTONOMY (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Helix 2 is a single neural system that can control a full humanoid
robot body directly from pixels. It enables continuous, room-scale
autonomy that seamlessly blends walking and manipulation. This article
details what Helix 2 is capable of. It contains several clips of the
Figure 03 robot performing tasks while running on the new system.

 STOP VIBE MESSING AND START VIBE SHIPPING WITH V0 BY VERCEL (SPONSOR)
[8] 

 Let's face it: vibe coding has resulted in a lot of demos, but not a
lot of software. With v0 by Vercel [8], that's no longer the case. v0
is built for production apps and agents, including enterprise-grade
security and integrations that enable teams to reliably ship real
software, not just spin up demos. Start shipping with v0. [8] 

 TRY TEXT SCALING SUPPORT IN CHROME CANARY (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The new 'meta name=text-scale' HTML tag informs browsers that
websites are designed to still work if users increase their OS text
size. To support text scaling, developers should avoid overriding the
initial font size, only use font-relative units for content, and test
on devices to quickly figure out problem areas and think about how to
adapt their layouts. The tag is currently supported in Chrome Canary
with the 'Experimental Web Platform features' flag enabled. Support in
other browsers will hopefully come later this year. 

 ONE HUMAN + ONE AGENT = ONE BROWSER FROM SCRATCH (2 MINUTE READ) [10]


 one-agent-one-browser is a web browser built in three days with a
single Codex CLI agent. It contains 20,000 lines of Rust with no Rust
crate dependencies at all, with only OS system frameworks for image
and text rendering. The browser successfully renders HTML and CSS and
can even display SVGs and PNGs. The project proves that an agent
driven by a talented engineer is enough to get a very solid basic
renderer working.

 AMAZON INADVERTENTLY ANNOUNCES CLOUD UNIT LAYOFFS IN EMAIL TO
EMPLOYEES (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Amazon erroneously sent out a notice to cloud staffers on Tuesday
acknowledging organizational changes at the company. The company is
expected to announce widespread layoffs across its corporate workforce
as soon as this week. The layoffs are meant to reduce management
layers and bureaucracy inside the company. The efficiency gains from
AI will likely further shrink Amazon's corporate staff count in the
coming years. 

 “IG IS A DRUG”: INTERNAL MESSAGES MAY DOOM META AT SOCIAL MEDIA
ADDICTION TRIAL (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A high-profile lawsuit against Meta and YouTube that alleges the
companies caused psychological harm by designing features like
infinite scroll and autoplay is set to begin this week. The case could
set a meaningful precedent for hundreds of other complaints. TikTok
and Snapchat were also targeted by the lawsuit, but both have settled.
The lawsuit seeks untold damages, including potentially punitive
damages, to help the plaintiff's family recoup losses and to punish
social media companies and deter them from promoting harmful features
to kids.
