 THE AI VOICE TOOL THAT HELPS YOU MOVE FASTER EVERYWHERE (SPONSOR) [4]


 For 150 years, we've been stuck typing. Wispr Flow [4] ends that era.

It turns your voice into clean, perfectly formatted writing the moment
you stop speaking — in Slack, Notion, Gmail, ChatGPT, or anywhere
you already work.

Flow learns your phrasing [4], edits as you speak, and helps you move
4× faster across every app — from enhancing GPT prompts to
capturing ideas or writing docs in seconds.

It's how builders, founders, and vibe coders stay in flow all day.

Less typing. More creating.

 GOOGLE ANNOUNCES EXPERIMENTAL ‘DISCO' BROWSER WITH ‘GENTABS'
POWERED BY GEMINI 3 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google Labs' Disco browser features a Gemini 3-powered 'GenTab' that

It can look at open tabs and chat history to determine what tool best
serves a prompt. Every generative element ties back to the web and
will link to the original sources. The most compelling ideas from
Disco may one day make their way into Chrome. A link to the waitlist
to try Disco is available in the article.

 AI HACKERS ARE COMING DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO BEATING HUMANS (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 AI hacking tools are now surpassing some human hackers. Stanford's
Artemis AI bot beat all except one of the 10 professional penetration
testers in a test of its abilities. It found bugs at lightning speed
while running at under $60 an hour. However, about 18% of the bugs it
found were false positives. It also missed an obvious bug that most of
the human testers spotted.

 COMPOUND ENGINEERING: HOW EVERY CODES WITH AGENTS (13 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 In traditional engineering, each feature makes the next feature
harder to build because of new edge cases, interdependencies, and
issues. In compound engineering, each feature makes the next feature
easier to build because compound engineering creates a learning loop
for agents and team members so that each bug, failed test, or insight
gets documented and used by future agents. AI's knowledge of the
codebase grows along with it, making future development work faster.
This post provides a high-level sense of how to start compound
engineering with AI. 

 AN SVG IS ALL YOU NEED (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 SVGs are vector graphics in a simple XML format. They are supported
on almost every device and platform. With embeddable scripts to make
them interactive, SVGs are way more capable than many people realize.
It is entirely feasible to implement an entire data analysis pipeline
in an SVG. A completely self-contained SVG file can fetch data from a
versioned repository, process that data, and generate visualizations
without any server-side magic required.

MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Several social media platforms are now required to shut down the
accounts of teens under 16 in Australia under a new law intended to
shelter children from the mental-health risks of life online. These
companies are now required to take reasonable steps to enforce the new
rules under threat of penalty. Parents and children won't be fined.
Australia isn't alone in its effort - Malaysia, the EU, New Zealand,
Florida, and other regions are also discussing similar restrictions. 

 DISNEY TO INVEST $1 BILLION IN OPENAI AND LICENSE CHARACTERS FOR USE

companies.
