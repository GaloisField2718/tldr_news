 THE CLOCK'S TICKING TO INVEST IN ‚ÄúTHE TESLA OF MICRO-EVS‚Äù...
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you missed out on Tesla gains, here's your chance to invest in
‚Äúthe Next Big Thing‚Äù, micro-EVs, a whopping $470B market. That's
just one of many reasons why 3700+ investors have invested in Eli
Electric Vehicles. [4]

Eli is rethinking urban transportation with their compact and
affordable EVs. Their flagship vehicle, Eli ZERO, is ‚Äúthe Tesla of
micro-EVs [4]‚Äù: 70% smaller than sedans, 2x as energy efficient as
regular EVs, and a third of the cost of a car, with advanced
automotive technology.

This seed-stage startup has already sold hundreds in Europe and is
gearing up to launch in the US this year. You can now join their
private raise and become an Eli shareholder [4].

Don't miss out‚ÄîThis investment opportunity ENDS TOMORROW, ON JUNE 27
[4].

 GOOGLE IS KILLING INFINITE SCROLL ON SEARCH RESULTS (1 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Continuous scrolling on Google search results, which was originally
introduced in October 2021, has been removed from desktop search
results and will be removed from mobile results in the coming months.
It has been replaced with Google's classic pagination bar, which
allows users to jump to a specific page of search results or simply
click 'Next' to see the next page. A 'More results' button will be
shown at the bottom of searches on mobile. The change will allow
Google to serve search results faster. 

 E.U. CHARGES MICROSOFT WITH ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS OVER TEAMS BUNDLING
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 EU regulators have charged Microsoft with breaking antitrust rules by
bundling its Teams video conferencing software with a suite of other
productivity tools, giving it an unfair advantage over rivals.
Businesses essentially had little choice but to use Teams if they
wanted other software made by Microsoft. Competitors also faced
challenges in making their services work with other Microsoft
software. Microsoft says it has already taken steps to resolve the
dispute, having unbundled Teams from other Office products last year.

 RESEARCHERS UPEND AI STATUS QUO BY ELIMINATING MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
IN LLMS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers claim to have developed a method of running AI models
more efficiently that involves eliminating matrix multiplication from
the process. A fundamental redesign of the neural network operations
that are currently accelerated by GPU chips, the method could have
deep implications for the environmental impact and operational costs
of AI systems. It challenges the prevailing paradigm that matrix
multiplication operations are indispensable for building
high-performing language models. The approach may outperform
traditional large language models at very large scales, but this has
not been tested due to computational constraints. 

 RESEARCHERS INVENT 100% BIODEGRADABLE 'BARLEY PLASTIC' (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Researchers from the University of Copenhagen have created a
biofriendly material made from barley starch blended with fiber from
sugarbeet waste. The material is strong and can completely decompose
within only two months if left in nature. It can be used for food
packaging, among many other things. The material can be easily made in
many places in the world. The researchers are now processing a patent
application for the biocomposite material.

 LITHIUM IS THE ‚ÄòNEW OIL'. INVEST IN THE PATENTED TECHNOLOGY THAT
JUST MADE ITS EXTRACTION 300% MORE EFFICIENT (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Electric cars are the future - and they run on lithium batteries.
With global demand about to far outstrip supply [10], analysts predict
this mineral will soar in value. GM-backed EnergyX has patented
technology [10] that extracts lithium 300% more efficiently. Their
eagerly-awaited open-to-the-public investment round [10] is now live
for a limited time. 

 DOTENVX (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 dotenvx is a better dotenv, a zero-dependency module that loads
environment variables from a .env file into process.env. It works the
same across every language, framework, and platform. dotenvx features
encrypted envs, variable expansion, multi-line values, contextual
help, command substitution, and more. 

 NOTION SITES TAKES NOTION SITES UP A LEVEL (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Notion has launched Notion Sites, a tool that turns Notion pages into
publicly-facing websites. It has features like custom favicons, the
ability to build navigation bars with links, and breadcrumb
navigation. Notion Sites can be easily published under custom domains.
It has basic SEO features and a Google Analytics integration. More
details about Notion Sites are available in the article.

 NEW GOOGLE AI EXPERIMENT COULD LET YOU CHAT WITH CELEBRITIES, YOUTUBE
INFLUENCERS (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google is reportedly working on an AI project that lets users talk to
chatbots modeled after celebrities, YouTube influencers, and other
personalities. The feature will allow anyone to create chatbots by
describing their personality and appearance and then converse with
them. It involves fine-tuning the Gemini family of language models to
mimic the response style of the described character. The project may
eventually be integrated into YouTube rather than launched as a
standalone product. 

 MY SPICIEST TAKE ON TECH HIRING (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 You only need to administer one technical interview and one
non-technical interview, each no more than an hour long, for each
candidate. Any interview process longer than that is unnecessary and
counterproductive. Adding more interviews makes you less likely to
gather the information you need because nobody bears the ultimate
responsibility for gathering decisive information. Dragging out the
process inadvertently selects for more desperate candidates. People
tend to make up their minds on candidates fairly early on in the
interview process - drawing out the process doesn't correct for this
bias.
