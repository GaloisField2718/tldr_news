 AIR-DEFLECTING SHIELD ALLOWS ATHLETES TO RUN LIKE THE UNIMPEDED WIND
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Airshield is a device that allows runners to train without
experiencing any air resistance. Currently a prototype, the Airshield
allows athletes to run faster than they are able to unaided, allowing
their bodies to learn the neuromuscular sequences required to run at
that speed. The wedge-shaped open-backed cart is towed behind an
electric go-kart, which is steered along a running track by a human
driver. Pictures and a video of the Airshield being used are available
in the article.

Arizona-based World View are just three of the startups currently
building balloons to hoist tourists to the stratosphere. Most of these

surface. At that height, the outside of the capsules will be
essentially a vacuum and the sky will be a deep black. Passengers will
not experience weightlessness. There will be no physical requirements
for passengers to board the balloons. Seats on the balloons range from
$50,000 to around $184,000.

 WHY FTC NEEDS TO RETHINK TECH REGULATION (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The current regulatory system isn't set up to consider regulations in
a long-term fashion in our technology-driven world. The FTC wants to
create opportunities for non-Big Tech companies, but the reality of
the technology ecosystem is very different. Many companies with the
potential to grow bigger are staying private to avoid public market
scrutiny. Regulators need to rethink what constitutes a monopoly in
the digital age.
