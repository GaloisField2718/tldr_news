 TESLA SHARES SLIDE AFTER IT REPORTS FIRST DROP IN ANNUAL DELIVERIES
(6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Tesla shares fell by around 7% in trading on Thursday after Tesla
released its fourth-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report.
The company's shares finished up 63% for the year. They reached an
all-time high in mid-December. Tesla aims to offer lower-cost and
autonomous vehicles in 2025. This is predicted to lead to 20% to 30%
growth over 2024. 

 STARLINK USERS CROSS 4.6 MILLION GLOBALLY IN 7 MONTHS (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 SpaceX's Starlink now serves over 4.6 million users across 118
countries and territories. The company reported 3 million users back
in May. It has since expanded its services to 27 new markets. SpaceX
completed 89 launches dedicated to building and enhancing the Starlink
satellite constellation throughout last year. The Starlink network
currently has over 7,000 active satellites in low Earth orbit, with
nearly 350 designed to connect directly to LTE phones.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 MEET THE ANTHROBOTS: A NEW LIVING ENTITY WITH MUCH TO TEACH US (17
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthrobots are synthetic biological proto-organisms made of living
cells with un-edited genomes. They could have many future uses in the
human body, including laying down pro-regenerative molecules, clearing
plaque from arteries, healing spinal cord or retinal damage, dealing
with cancer cells or bacteria in the gut, or informing doctors of the
status of the surrounding tissues. Anthrobots do not exponentially
reproduce and just biodegrade at the end of their lifespan. Scientists
are still experimenting with these lifeforms to get a true idea of
their capabilities in various problem spaces. 

 NEXT-GEN WI-FI TO TRADE LUDICROUS SPEED FOR THE BORING ART OF
ACTUALLY WORKING (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Wi-Fi 8 looks to be focused on greater reliability rather than on
pushing bandwidth even higher. It will make the speed gains promised
by Wi-Fi 7 more of a reality. End users will not see the full benefits
until they have upgraded both their access points and endpoint devices
to the new standard. The first devices with Wi-Fi 8 are not expected
to roll out until the second half of 2028.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 ZASPER (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 Zasper is an IDE designed to support massive concurrency. It has a
minimal memory footprint and provides exceptional speed. Zasper can be
used to run REPL-style data applications like Jupyter notebooks. It is
currently fully supported on Mac, with limited support on Linux. 

 NOTES ON THE NEW DEEPSEEK V3 (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Deepseek's flagship model, v3, is a 607B Mixture-of-Experts model
with 37B active parameters. The company achieved remarkable
performance while keeping training costs surprisingly low. The model
outperforms other alternatives at its price point. It excels at
reasoning and math, surpassing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

 ASK HN: WHERE TO WORK AFTER 40? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [10] 

 Heaps of companies want employees with long-term experience. Many of
these companies aren't attractive to younger workers and would be glad
to hire someone with experience. Experienced workers can also enter
into consulting/professional services, which provides a varied and
interesting work environment. The expiry date for a software engineer
is definitely much later than 40 - many are still working late into
their 50s and 60s. 

 I STILL DON'T THINK COMPANIES SERVE YOU ADS BASED ON SPYING THROUGH
YOUR MICROPHONE (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Many people are convinced that companies are targeting ads to them by
listening through their phone's microphones. For this to be true,
companies would have to record audio snippets, transmit them back to
their servers for additional processing, and then feed that data into
a system that forwards it to advertising partners. This is
far-fetched, especially for companies like Apple, which has a brand
and reputation as a privacy-first company and spends large amounts on
product design and engineering to prevent apps from doing exactly this
kind of thing. The more likely scenario is that the quality of
targeting is high and that people just aren't that different from each
other.
