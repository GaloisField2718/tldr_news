 CHROME‚ÄôS NEXT WEAPON IN THE WAR ON AD BLOCKERS: SLOWER EXTENSION
UPDATES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Manifest V3 will delay extension developers' abilities to react
quickly to changes by putting up roadblocks before extension updates
on Chrome's extension platform. Ad blocking is a cat-and-mouse game of
updates and counter-updates, and Google is forcing one side to slow
down. With Manifest V3, all updates to extensions, including filtering
lists, will need to happen through a full extension update on the
Chrome Web Store, which means they will be subject to the Chrome Web
Store reviews process. Once it becomes mandatory in June 2024, daily
updates will no longer be an option. 

 SAMSUNG GALAXY S24 LEAKS SUGGEST A TITANIUM BUILD, FLATTENED SCREEN,
AND MORE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Samsung's S24 devices will use AI to translate messaging apps in
real-time in over a dozen languages. They may also use Samsung's
AI-powered Zoom Anyplace camera framing feature. The devices will use
Qualcomm modems with Smart Transit functionality. The Samsung Galaxy
S24 Ultra will have a new flattened screen design, a titanium frame,
an upgraded 50 MP 5x telephoto camera, better vapor chamber cooling,
and Wi-Fi 7. More details about the devices and official images from
Samsung are available in the article.

 WORLD‚ÄôS BIGGEST EXPERIMENTAL NUCLEAR FUSION REACTOR LAUNCHED IN
JAPAN (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The world's biggest operational experimental nuclear fusion reactor
has been inaugurated in Japan. The JT-60SA reactor aims to investigate
the feasibility of fusion as a safe, large-scale, and carbon-free
source of net energy. The six-story-high machine is a joint project
between the European Union and Japan. It is the result of a
collaboration between more than 500 scientists and engineers and more
than 70 companies throughout Europe and Japan. 

 TINY ROBOTS MADE FROM HUMAN CELLS HEAL DAMAGED TISSUE (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Scientists from Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, have
developed tiny robots called anthrobots made of human cells capable of
repairing damaged neural tissue. The technique involves synthetically
controlling a range of developmental processes and could be used in
the future for personalized medicine. The scientists think that
anthrobots made from a person's own tissue could be used to clear
arteries, break up mucus, or deliver drugs with or without genetic
engineering. Anthrobots could have applications in sustainable
construction and outer-space exploration.

 ‚ù§Ô∏è FINALLY, A COST-EFFECTIVE AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
SOLUTION (SPONSOR) [9] 

 If you've tried to manage automated test coverage in-house, you know
it takes years to scale and is a pain in the a** to maintain. Try QA
Wolf [9] instead - they get web apps to 80% test coverage in just 4
months. They create and maintain your test suite in Playwright, plus
provide unlimited parallel test runs on their infrastructure. QA Wolf
has tons of customer case studies reporting $200,000+ per year in
savings. Schedule a demo to learn more. [9]

 GQL - GIT QUERY LANGUAGE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 GQL is a query language with a syntax similar to SQL. It executes
queries on .git files without the need to create database files or
convert the files into any other format. Keywords in GQL are
case-insensitive, similar to SQL. 

 SQLSYNC (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 SQLSync is a collaborative offline-first wrapper around SQLite
designed to synchronize web application state between users, devices,
and the edge. It features eventually consistent SQLite, optimistic
reads and writes, reactive query subscriptions, real-time
collaboration, and more. A live demo is available.

 INSIDE APPLE‚ÄôS CHIP LAB, HOME TO THE MOST ‚ÄòPROFOUND CHANGE‚Äô AT
THE COMPANY IN DECADES (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple's soaring stock price over the last two decades was driven by
its consumer devices powered by custom chips. The company debuted its
first homegrown semiconductors in 2010. As of this year, all new Mac
computers are powered by Apple's own silicon. This article takes a
look at the development of Apple's custom hardware over the years and
what will come next for the biggest US company by market cap. 

 THE 500 HIGHEST PAYING COMPANIES FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS (GITHUB REPO)
[13] 

 This repository contains a very rough list of 500 companies that tend
to pay a relatively high amount for software engineering-related
roles. The data is based on median software engineering total
compensation as it appears on levels.fyi. The analysis is not meant to
be serious and it skips over many important steps.
