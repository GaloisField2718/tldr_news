 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native solution provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA
cycle to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks [6]—not years
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs [7]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of engineers [8] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

 EYE PROSTHESIS IS THE FIRST TO RESTORE SIGHT LOST TO MACULAR
DEGENERATION (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 PRIMA is an eye prosthesis that can restore functional sight to
patients with advanced macular degeneration. It gives wearers the
ability to perceive shapes and patterns, with most wearers regaining
the ability to read a year after receiving the device. Wearers can
adjust contrast and brightness and magnify their vision up to 12
times. The device currently only provides black-and-white vision, but
researchers are working to produce a full range of grayscale. 

 AN ALZHEIMER'S PILL APPEARS TO PROTECT SOME IN A HIGH-RISK POPULATION
(4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 An experimental drug called valiltramiprosate (ALZ-801) slowed
cognitive decline by 52% in people with mild cognitive impairment in a
study of more than 300 people aged 50 or older who were genetically
predisposed to Alzheimer's disease. Participants who received the drug
experienced about 18% less atrophy in the hippocampus compared to
those who received a placebo. ALZ-801 is a twice-daily pill that can
be taken at home. It works by preventing amyloid proteins from
clumping and forming plaques.
