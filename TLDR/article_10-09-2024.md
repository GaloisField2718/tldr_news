 ANTHROPIC'S MIKE KRIEGER WANTS TO BUILD AI PRODUCTS THAT ARE WORTH
THE HYPE (82 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article contains an interview with Mike Krieger, the new chief
product officer at Anthropic, where he discusses why he decided to
work in AI, what products he sees AI will bring in the future, and how
he is thinking about building them. Krieger co-founded Instagram. He
left Meta in 2018 and launched an AI-powered news reader, which was
shut down earlier this year. Anthropic was started in 2021 by former
OpenAI executives and researchers. Its main product is Claude, an
industry-leading AI model and chatbot that competes with ChatGPT.

 THE NEW ERA OF TREATING SCHIZOPHRENIA (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Schizophrenia is one of the costliest mental health illnesses - it
costs nearly $300 billion dollars in healthcare spending annually
despite affecting less than 1% of the population. It is currently
treated with antipsychotics, a treatment discovered through pure
chance. Regulators are currently deciding whether to approve a drug
with a novel mechanism for treating schizophrenia. The new drug has
opened up a new hypothesis for schizophrenia, which multiple biotech
companies are pursuing. 

 FIRST STEP FOR EUROPE'S HYPERLOOP VEHICLES WITH TEST LAUNCH (3 MINUTE
READ) [8]

hour, but operators hope to reach 100 kph by the end of the year. It
will be ready to transport passengers by 2030. The technology has the
potential to revolutionize travel in Europe, enabling passengers to
reach from Amsterdam to Berlin in 90 minutes or Milan in two hours.

 DESIGN PATTERNS ARE TEMPORARY, LANGUAGE FEATURES ARE FOREVER (7
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Design patterns make certain problems easier to deal with. Some
patterns are easier to write in some languages than others. A language
update to implement these patterns can make things easier for
developers and produce cleaner code. This article presents an example
of this where a new feature in Java made a particular design pattern a
thing of the past. 

 WHY GITHUB ACTUALLY WON (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article, written by one of GitHub's cofounders, discusses the
reasoning behind the rise and dominance of the platform. GitHub
started at the right time and it had good taste. It started when
distributed open source version control tools were starting to get
useful, solid, and adopted and there was nobody around to host them.
Its competitors couldn't compete with a developer tools company whose
cofounders were all product-focused open source software developers
that cared about the developer experience. Everyone else was trying to
build what they thought they could sell to advertisers or CTOs.

 THE COLLEGE DROPOUT WHO INVESTED BILLIONS TO COZY UP WITH ELON MUSK
(12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 John Hering and Alexander Tamas' venture firm, Vy Capital, has
invested more than half of its $8 billion in reported assets into Elon
Musk's startups. The investors frequently make trips to directly help
solve problems in Musk's companies. Despite their efforts, neither
Hering nor Tamas holds a board seat at any of Musk's companies. The
results of their investments have not been promising, but they have
brought the investors closer to Musk. 

 DOJ CLAIMS GOOGLE HAS ‚ÄúTRIFECTA OF MONOPOLIES‚Äù ON DAY 1 OF AD
TECH TRIAL (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The US Department of Justice's next monopoly trial against Google
started on Monday. The trial challenges the tech giant's ad tech
dominance. The DOJ is arguing that Google broke competition in the ad
tech space by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of
the tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers to facilitate
digital advertising. Google profits from both advertisers and
publishers, pocketing at least 30 cents of each advertising dollar
flowing from advertisers to website publishers through its ad tech
tools. The trial is expected to last four to six weeks and may be the
most consequential of the monopoly trials Google has recently faced.
