 ALL THE RUMORS ABOUT THE IPHONE AIR (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The iPhone Air may mark the biggest design shift for the line in many
years. Rumors suggest that the super-thin iPhone will debut as part of
the iPhone 17 lineup this fall. There are enough rumors to infer that
something real is in the works. This article rounds up all of the
current rumors about the upcoming device, which will sacrifice some
function for a sleeker, slimmer design. Apple is likely using the
device as a testing ground for new technologies, including its
in-house wireless and cell modem chips and the smaller tech needed to
eventually build a folding iPhone. 

 THE 850 BILLION REASONS APPLE AND OTHERS AREN'T TAKING A CHANCE ON
TIKTOK (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 TikTok has been removed from app stores in the US despite the Biden
administration issuing a statement that it didn't intend to try to
enforce the law and Trump saying there would be no liability for
ignoring the law while he tries to suspend the ban. The law allows for
app stores to be fined $5,000 per user, which would be a massive blow
even for a company of Apple's size. It is not clear whether Trump has
the power to shield companies from this liability. The providers that
have resumed service for TikTok are rapidly accruing tens, if not
hundreds of billions of dollars of liability.

 OPENAI'S AGENT TOOL MAY BE NEARING RELEASE (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A software engineer claims to have uncovered evidence of OpenAI's
long-rumored Operator, an AI tool that can take control of users' PCs
and perform actions on their behalf. OpenAI may be releasing the tool
this month. The company's site and apps now contain hidden references
to Operator. While AI agents are risky and speculative, tech giants
are already touting them as the next big thing in AI. Analysts say the
market for AI agents could be worth $47.1 billion by 2030.

 THE MAKING OF COMMUNITY NOTES (40 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article contains an interview with the team that built X's
Community Notes feature where they discuss the design process and the
philosophy behind their approach to combating false information on the
platform. The idea for Community Notes started around the end of 2019
with the observation that people wanted to get accurate information on
social media while there was obvious misinformation going around. The
main approaches that were used by other companies at the time were
slow, didn't scale well, and suffered from a fundamental trust problem
- people don't want a tech company deciding what is true. Wikipedia
showed that crowdsourcing was a potential solution space, and
follow-up studies by the team confirmed the idea was worth
implementing. 

 TWELVE DUDES AND A HYPE TUNNEL: SCENES FROM THE ‘SUPER BOWL FOR

was a $5,000 prize. The organizer, Andrew Grigolyunovich, hopes to
turn competitive Excel into a popular e-sport where pros compete for
million-dollar prizes.
