 CHATGPT'S AI ‚ÄòMEMORY' CAN REMEMBER THE PREFERENCES OF PAYING
CUSTOMERS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's Memory feature, which allows ChatGPT to store queries,
prompts, and other customizations, is now available to ChatGPT Plus
paying subscribers outside of Europe and Korea. Memory lets users tell
ChatGPT to remember certain details and allows the chatbot to learn
from conversations. Users have control over what ChatGPT retains and
what is used for additional training. ChatGPT will tell users when
memories are updated. The feature will eventually roll out ChatGPT
Enterprise and Teams, but OpenAI has not specified when. 

 MUSK WINS CHINA'S BACKING FOR TESLA'S DRIVER-ASSISTANCE SERVICE (6
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 China's government has signaled its blessing for Tesla to roll out
its advanced driver-assistance service in the country. Tesla will
deploy its Full Self-Driving service based on mapping and navigation
functions provided by Baidu. Being able to roll out FSD in China will
help Tesla compete with major Chinese carmakers, some of which already
provide higher-level driver-assistance features. Chinese officials
have yet to respond to Elon Musk's request to transfer the data that
Tesla cars collect in China to the US to further train the system.

 CHINA READY TO LAUNCH LUNAR FAR SIDE SAMPLE RETURN MISSION (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 China's Chang'e-6 mission aims to land on the far side of the moon
and collect up to 2,000 grams of lunar material to return to Earth.
The mission will also include international scientific payloads from
France, Sweden, Italy, and Pakistan. The launch time has yet to be
disclosed, but navigation warnings indicate that the launch is
expected early Friday. China plans to send a crewed mission to the
Moon by 2030 and establish a permanent lunar base through the
International Lunar Research Station program in the 2030s. 

 ATOMIC NUCLEUS EXCITED WITH LASER: A BREAKTHROUGH AFTER DECADES (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The long-sought thorium transition has been found. This discovery
promises revolutionary technological applications and could answer the
question of whether the constants of nature are actually constant or
whether they change in space and time. It makes it possible to combine
classical quantum physics and nuclear physics. The technology can be
used for precision measurements. It could create new types of clocks
that would be significantly more accurate than the best atomic clocks
available today and devices that analyze the gravitational field
around Earth to provide indications of mineral resources or
earthquakes.

 GPT2-CHATBOT (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 gpt2-chatbot recently appeared in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena,
demonstrating greater compatibility than any previously known GPT-2
model. There is little information about the model listed on the site
or elsewhere. This article explores the model and its capabilities.
The model appears to be based on the GPT-4 architecture and
consistently provides different outputs than models from other
companies. It can be more performant than certain other models in
specific domains. It is possible that this mystery model is in fact
GPT-4.5.
