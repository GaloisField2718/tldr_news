 üëã GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage ‚Äî and staying there
‚Äî is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [4] AI-native approach gets engineering teams to 80%
automated end-to-end test coverage [4] and helps them SHIP 5X FASTER
by reducing QA cycles from hours to minutes.

QA Wolf [4] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [5] achieved
4x more test cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

 FIRST LOOK AT GOOGLE PIXEL 9A WITH STUNNING 5K RENDERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The new design of the Pixel 9a has been leaked ahead of its expected
launch in the Spring. The biggest change appears to be the camera bar,
which is now nearly flush with the back of the device. The Pixel 9a
will launch with Android 15 and seven years of updates. The specs will
likely be very similar to the Pixel 8a. 

 THE ART OF THE OPENAI DEAL (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's upcoming investment round includes a term where the company
has two years to convert to a for-profit business or the funding will
convert into debt. While convertible notes are common, this is
essentially the opposite. This could be a very real problem for the
company in a couple of years if it is neither a for-profit nor
insanely profitable.

 AI BOTS NOW BEAT 100% OF THOSE TRAFFIC-IMAGE CAPTCHAS (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Locally run bots using specially trained image-recognition models can
achieve a 100% success rate when challenged with Google's ReCAPTCHA
v2. Google has been phasing out the system in favor of a new
'invisible' system that analyzes user interactions. However, it is
still used by millions of websites. Details about how the system works
are available in the article. 

 AI'S THIRST FOR ENERGY HAS ANOTHER NUCLEAR PLANT COMING ONLINE (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Holtec Palisades has received a $1.52 billion loan from the
Department of Energy to restore a nuclear power plant in Michigan. The
plant ceased operations in 2022, but will be brought back online as
early as 2025. It will add about 600 jobs to the area. Holtec had
originally bought the plant to dismantle it, but changed course due to
renewed interest in nuclear power from data center providers.

 TIPS FOR BUILDING AND DEPLOYING ROBOTS (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Use other people's supply chain scale wherever possible. Using
existing infrastructure makes deploying robots easier. New
infrastructure made for humans tends to also be useful for robots.
Deployed robots live in a sea of real-world data - this can be used
for various things, for example, training learning algorithms or to
create synchronized networks so robots know what is happening in the
world. 

 QRFRAME (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 qrframe is a code-based QR code generator. It can create QR codes
with customized data in many different styles. Many examples of
generated codes are available.

 Y COMBINATOR TRADED PRESTIGE FOR GROWTH (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Reputation and prestige are everything. The reason Harvard doesn't
accept a higher percentage of applicants isn't because it can't scale,
but because it chooses not to. Its success lies in exclusivity. Y
Combinator is trading its reputation capital for money - it now looks
like it is willing to fund just about anything, which means that the
accelerator isn't doing any real due diligence and doesn't care about
its existing portfolio companies. It is no longer an exclusive club
that signals legitimacy. 

 EPIC GAMES SUES GOOGLE, SAMSUNG OVER ALLEGED APP-STORE SCHEME (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Epic is suing Google and Samsung, claiming that the tech giants
colluded to place onerous restrictions on app stores. The lawsuit
alleges that Google and Samsung made it too difficult for consumers to
download app stores from outside software developers by making a
feature called Auto Blocker active by default on Samsung's newest
smartphones. The feature prevents users from downloading alternative
app stores. Turning off the feature and installing a third-party app
store requires 21 steps. The friction has caused 50% of users trying
to install the Epic Games Store on Android to give up before they've
gotten it installed.
