 TESLA AWARDS MUSK $29 BILLION IN SHARES WITH PRIOR PAY PACKAGE IN
LIMBO (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla's board has awarded Elon Musk an interim pay package of 96
million shares worth about $29 billion. The package includes shares
that vest in two years as long as Musk continues as CEO or in another
key executive position. It will be forfeited if the legal battle over
Musk's 2017 compensation ends with him being able to exercise shares
from that package. The pay plan was approved by a 'special committee'
of the Tesla board that included board chair Robyn Denholm and
director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. It doesn't limit Musk's ability to
start new businesses or continue with his political work. 

 SPACEX TIPS 'STARLINK COMMUNITY' FOR CHEAPER, SHARED SATELLITE
INTERNET ACCESS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Starlink Community is a new option that makes Starlink more
accessible. It allows multiple subscribers to share access to a single
satellite dish for a lower fee of $60 per month. Each subscriber will
need their own Wi-Fi router. The service may be targeting apartment
complexes without access to stable high-speed broadband. It is unclear
when the service will launch.

 APPLE'S NEW BRAIN-CONTROLLED IPHONE, IPAD TECH REVEALED IN VIDEO (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Synchron recently published a video of a patient controlling their
iPad entirely with their thoughts. Apple is developing ways for Brain
Computer Interfaces (BCIs) to translate brain signals into controls
for its devices. The Synchron BCI is implanted in the brain's motor
cortex using a minimally invasive endovascular procedure that involves
inserting a catheter through the jugular vein. Synchron's device has
been implanted in 10 people so far. The video of the patient
controlling an iPad with their mind is available in the article. 

 CHINESE AI RESEARCHERS JUST PUT A MONKEY'S BRAIN ON A COMPUTER (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Chinese researchers claim to have created an AI version of a monkey's
brain. Project Darwin Monkey is the largest brain-like computer in the
world, with 960 chips, each supporting over 2 billion spiking neurons
and over 100 billion synapses, approaching the number of neurons in a
macaque brain. Darwin Monkey uses DeepSeek's AI model for intelligent
tasks such as logical reasoning, content generation, and mathematical
problem solving. It has a custom operating system that uses concurrent
scheduling of neuromorphic tasks and dynamic optimization of system
resources for more efficiency.

 THE NEW DEVEX DILEMMA: TIME SAVED, COMPLEXITY GAINED (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Atlassian's new State of DevEx report [9]shows that while developers
are saving time with AI, they're also facing more organizational
complexity than ever. We surveyed developers and managers to uncover
what's really happening behind the hype. Get the full breakdown [9]
and learn how to improve DevEx in an AI-powered world. 

 ESTIMATES ARE MORE VALUABLE THAN YOU THINK (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Good estimation is about creating trust and transparency. An estimate
is the beginning of a conversation that surfaces hidden complexity
before it becomes a problem. Estimates are valuable when they become a
shared language between developers and stakeholders, as they become
reference points for meaningful discussions about progress and
priorities. Estimates create visibility into the work to be done,
allowing managers to check in without being intrusive and creating
realistic expectations. Teams that consistently deliver treat
estimates as tools for collaboration rather than a source of stress.
Adjusting an estimate based on new information isn't admitting defeat:
it's being professional. 

 THE PRODUCT DESIGN TALENT CRISIS (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The demand for senior product designers has skyrocketed in the past
five years. This has left a troubling gap as there are fewer
opportunities for designers to gain critical experience and mentorship
to develop into the next generation of leaders. If the trend
continues, the field of design risks becoming stagnant, overqualified,
and obsolete. Other industries have proven that sustainable talent
development is possible, but it requires deliberate structure and
aligned incentives.

 THE RISE OF SILICON VALLEY'S TECHNO-RELIGION (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Lighthaven hotel has become a temple to the pursuit of artificial
intelligence and the future of humanity. The gated complex includes
five buildings and a small park. It is the de facto headquarters of
the Rationalists, a group with many interests involving mathematics,
genetics, and philosophy. One of the Rationalists' overriding beliefs
is that artificial intelligence can deliver a better life if it
doesn't destroy humanity first. The group believes it is up to the
people building AI to ensure that it is a force for the greater good. 

 LONGEVITY FIRMS PUSH MONTANA TO BECOME HUB FOR BIOHACKING,
EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Montana passed a law in 2023 that allows any patient to access
experimental treatments, not just those with terminal illnesses. In
May, the state's governor signed a bill to create a framework for
licensed treatment centers to offer access to therapies that have
passed a Phase 1 safety trial. Patients are unlikely to receive their
first therapies under the law before 2026, but roughly 20 businesses,
ranging from small biotech companies to medical clinic operators, have
already reached out to express interest in operating in Montana under
the new law. Healthcare providers and drug makers will be largely
protected from legal liability if patients are harmed unless they are
negligent or fail to get proper consent from patients.
