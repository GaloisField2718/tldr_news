 META EXEC DENIES THE COMPANY ARTIFICIALLY BOOSTED LLAMA 4'S BENCHMARK
SCORES (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An unsubstantiated rumor that Meta artificially boosted its Llama 4
benchmark results began circulating on X and Reddit over the weekend.
Meta's VP of generative AI Ahman Al-Dahle has denied the rumors,
saying that Meta did not train its models on test sets. The rumor
appears to have originated from a post on Chinese social media from a
user claiming to have resigned from Meta in protest over the company's
benchmarking practices. Researchers have observed stark differences in
the behavior of the publicly downloadable models compared with the
models hosted on LM Arena. 

 OPENAI REPORTEDLY MULLS BUYING JONY IVE AND SAM ALTMAN'S AI HARDWARE
STARTUP (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI is reportedly in discussions to buy the company former Apple
design lead Jony Ive is building with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Ive is
working with Altman on io Products, a startup that aims to build
products 'less socially disruptive than the iPhone'. OpenAI may end up
partnering with io Products instead of acquiring the startup. io
Products currently has a small team that includes former Apple
designers. It has reportedly been working on different concepts of
AI-enabled devices.

 SCIENTISTS REVIVE THE DIRE WOLF, OR SOMETHING CLOSE (13 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Dire wolves went extinct around 13,000 years ago. Scientists at
Colossal Biosciences have bred gray-wolf pups that carry dire wolf
genes. The three animals are currently living in captivity in the
northern United States. The technology used to create them could
potentially help revive other species and conserve species that have
not yet gone extinct. Pictures of the dire wolf pups are available in
the article. 

 THE 'WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED MICROCHIP' HAS BEEN UNVEILED (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 TSMC introduced a 2-nanometer chip on April 1, with mass production
expected for the second half of the year. The chips represent a major
step forward in performance and efficiency and could potentially
reshape the technological landscape. They provide a 10% to 15% boost
in computing speed at the same power level or a 20% to 30% reduction
in power usage at the same speed as 3nm chips and increase transistor
density by about 15%. The new chips enable devices to operate faster,
consume electricity, and manage more complex tasks efficiently.

 THE DAY I TAUGHT AI TO THINK LIKE A SENIOR DEVELOPER (5 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 AI IDEs don't actually understand codebases, they're just
sophisticated autocomplete tools with good marketing. The difference
becomes painfully obvious on any moderately complex project. The next
generation of tools will build rich mental models from multiple
perspectives, just like experienced developers do. This article
discusses an approach to building an AI that understands where files
should be logically placed, which patterns to follow, how to extend
existing abstractions instead of creating new ones, and when to reuse
code vs create new implementations. 

 BROWSER MCP (WEBSITE) [14] 

 Browser MCP allows users to connect AI apps to their browsers to
automate tasks. Automation happens locally on users' machines,
resulting in better performance without network latency. Browser
activity stays on-device and isn't sent to remote servers. Browser MCP
uses existing browser profiles, keeping users logged into all of their
services. It avoids CAPTCHAs by using real browser fingerprints.

 POWER TO THE PEOPLE: HOW LLMS FLIP THE SCRIPT ON TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION
(4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Large language models generate disproportionate benefit for regular
people while their impact is more muted and lagging in corporations
and governments. It is a major multiplier to individuals' power levels
across a broad range of capabilities. Frontier-grade performance is
very accessible and cheap - money can't buy a better ChatGPT. This is
a unique situation in the history of technology - the future is
already here, and it's shockingly distributed. 

 REFLEXIVE AI USAGE IS NOW A BASELINE EXPECTATION AT SHOPIFY (4 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Shopify now expects its staff to use AI. The prototype phase of any
GSD project should now be dominated by AI exploration. Shopify is
adding AI usage questions to its performance and peer review
questionnaire to encourage staff to learn to prompt and load context.
Teams must now demonstrate why they can't achieve their goals using AI
before asking for more headcount and resources.
