 SOFTBANK SELLS ITS NVIDIA STAKE FOR $5.8 BILLION TO FUND OPENAI BET
(6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Softbank has sold its $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia to invest more
into OpenAI. The investment group's commitments to OpenAI have been
profitable - Softbank reported on Tuesday that its quarterly profit
had more than doubled compared to a year earlier. Softbank recently
sold part of its stake in T-Mobile's US arm and Deutsche Telekom. It
has also loaded up on debt. 

 GOOGLE SAYS NEW CLOUD-BASED “PRIVATE AI COMPUTE” IS JUST AS
SECURE AS LOCAL PROCESSING (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's Private AI Compute runs on a stack powered by the company's
custom Tensor Processing Units, which have integrated secure elements.
The new system will allow devices to connect directly to the protected
space via an encrypted link. This will mean that not even Google will
be able to access the data. The service will be as secure as using
local processing while providing enough processing power to use
Google's largest and most capable models on any device.

 SPACEX'S NEXT PROJECT WILL PRODUCE STARSHIPS AT A LEVEL THAT SOUNDS
IMPOSSIBLE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX's newest Starbase facility in Texas, the Gigabay, is designed
to manufacture up to a thousand Starship rockets a year. It will be
one of the largest industrial structures to date. Construction of the
facility is expected to be completed in December 2026. 

 MIT PHYSICISTS OBSERVE KEY EVIDENCE OF UNCONVENTIONAL
SUPERCONDUCTIVITY IN MAGIC-ANGLE GRAPHENE (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 'Unconventional' superconductors are materials that exhibit
superconductivity in ways that are different from today's
superconductors, which require ultra-low temperatures to operate. MIT
physicists have created a material that shows a superconducting gap
very different from that of the typical superconductor, meaning that
the mechanism by which the material becomes superconductive must also
be different. Understanding how unconventional superconductors work
could unlock the design of superconductors that work at room
temperature, the Holy Grail of the entire field.

 CUT QA CYCLES FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED TESTING (SPONSOR)
[9] 

 If slow QA cycles are holding your team back from releasing faster,
try QA Wolf [10]. Their fully managed, AI-native service delivers 80%
AUTOMATED E2E TEST COVERAGE in weeks and helps teams SHIP 5× FASTER
by cutting QA cycles from hours to minutes. With unlimited parallel
runs, 24-hour test maintenance, and zero flakes, teams like Drata [11]
have achieved 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

 VERTICAL INTEGRATION IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS (13 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 The inability of developer productivity startups to vertically
integrate their offerings has hindered their adoption and utility.
Vertical integration refers to a tight integration between different
tools in a stack. Being unable to ship the whole stack means limiting
the features you can provide. 'Glue code' is what makes this all work.


 SCALING HNSWS (25 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm is a
graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search technique used in many
vector databases. This post shares advanced findings on HNSWs. HNSWs
are resistant to low latency and high performance, so the post is
focused on making them fast enough to allow for a 'Redis' experience.
It covers the challenges involved in exposing HNSWs as abstract data
structures.

 META AI PIONEER HAS DISCUSSED LEAVING TO LAUNCH A STARTUP (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Yann LeCun, the AI pioneer who has led Meta's AI efforts for more
than a decade, has reportedly recruited colleagues and spoken to
investors about possibly creating a startup focused on developing
world models. LeCun has become one of the biggest skeptics that large
language models could lead to superintelligence. He has advocated for
a new type of training for AI models based on real-world data. LeCun
believes that within three to five years, world models will be the
dominant model for AI architectures and that nobody will use the kind
of models we have today. 

 GALAXY BRAIN RESISTANCE (25 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 If your arguments can justify anything, then they imply nothing.
Arguments like these are almost always rationalizations. Galaxy brain
resistance refers to how difficult it is to abuse an argument.
Patterns of reasoning that are very low in galaxy brain resistance are
common - this can have some extreme consequences. You can avoid galaxy
braining yourself by having principles with a very high bar for
considering any exceptions, and setting the right incentives - the
easiest way to do this is to not give yourself bad incentives.
