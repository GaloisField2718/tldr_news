 THE RABBIT R1 IS AN AI-POWERED GADGET THAT CAN USE YOUR APPS FOR YOU
(4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Rabbit R1 is a $199 standalone device about half the size of an
iPhone powered by a 'Large Action Model'. It has a 2.88-inch
touchscreen, a rotating camera for taking photos and videos, a scroll
wheel/button for navigation, 128GB of storage, and a battery that
lasts all day. The device runs on Rabbit OS, which features a
universal controller for apps that can control music, order items from
the internet, send messages, and more. It is trained on how to use
existing apps for itself and has a dedicated training mode for users
to teach it tasks, so developers don't have to do anything to support
the device. A 26-minute-long introduction video from Rabbit about the
device is available in the article. 

 CES 2024: AMAZON UNVEILS MATTER CASTING STANDARD AS INTEROPERABLE
ALTERNATIVE TO AIRPLAY (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Matter Casting is a casting feature that will initially only support
streaming content from Amazon's Prime Video app to Echo Show devices.
The feature will support Fire TV in the coming months and a range of
video services later in the year. Matter Casting is designed to be
interoperable across platforms. While both Apple and Google worked
with Amazon on the Matter Home standard, neither company has announced
any plans to support Matter Casting.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 POTENT PSYCHEDELIC DRUG BANISHES PTSD, SMALL STUDY FINDS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A small trial on military veterans suggests that ibogaine, a potent
psychedelic drug, could be used to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI).
The study found that veterans with TBI symptoms such as post-traumatic
stress disorder and depression had the symptoms decrease by more than
80% on average after treatment. Ibogaine seems to have a broad,
dramatic, and consistent effect. The data supports launching rigorous
trials to test the drug. 

 HOW MICROSOFT FOUND A POTENTIAL NEW BATTERY MATERIAL USING AI (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have found a
new battery material using AI and large-scale cloud computing. The
material is a new kind of solid-state electrolyte. It could lead to
batteries that are less likely to burst into flames compared to
lithium-ion batteries. While the material still needs to be tested to
see whether it is a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries, the
finding demonstrates AI's potential for speeding up material
discovery.

 SPIN (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Spin is a bash utility that improves the Docker experience. It can
replicate any environment on any machine and centralize infrastructure
from a single configuration file. Spin dramatically improves the
developer experience when working with Docker using officially
supported features and best practices. 

 AI GATEWAY (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 AI Gateway is an interface between apps and hosted large language
models. It streamlines API requests to LLM providers using a unified
API. AI Gateway is fast, with a tiny footprint, and it can load
balance across multiple models, providers, and keys. It has fallbacks
to ensure app resiliency and plug-in middleware as needed.

 IT‚ÄôS HUMANS ALL THE WAY DOWN (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 People think that AI is going to replace a lot of jobs because
everyone thinks that everyone else's job is easy. The desire to remove
humans from the equation is based on ignorance. Even with the wildest
of innovations, people still matter, and this can't be avoided. People
want to appeal to other humans and be seen and understood. 

 NVIDIA‚ÄôS G-SYNC PULSAR IS ANTI-BLUR MONITOR TECH AIMED SQUARELY AT
YOUR EYEBALL (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Nvidia‚Äôs G-Sync Pulsar uses a novel algorithm to reduce motion blur
and pixel ghosting. The technology can help with the visual discomfort
caused by some strobing effects. It will require monitors to have
Nvidia's chips built into them. The first monitor with the feature is
the Asus ROG Swift PG27 Series G-Sync, which will be available later
this year.
