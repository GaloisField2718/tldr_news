 HOW TO FIX THE #1 PROBLEM WITH VIBE CODING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Vibe coding makes building fast—but hides what's really happening.
All of the logic, architecture, and security live in hundreds of lines
of code. Even to a trained engineer, the sheer volume can make it
impractical to parse.

VIBE CODE WITHOUT THE BLACK BOX.

Xano lets you build with AI _and_ see your entire backend logic
visually, so you can ship faster and stay in control.

No black boxes. Just visibility, flexibility, and a production-ready
backend that powers any app.

Xano gives you everything you need—logic, data, server, and
auth—and works with any frontend, including projects built with
Lovable, WeWeb, and more.

 ANDROID 17 WILL PUT FULL-SCREEN APPS ON YOUR ALWAYS-ON DISPLAY (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google plans to add a new capability called Min Mode to Android's
Always-On Display (AOD) in Android 17. Min Mode will use the same
low-power technology as AOD to display full-screen interfaces from
apps. Developers must register a 'MinModeActivity' component in their
apps for them to work with the feature. Min Mode has the potential to
reshape the definition of an 'idle' phone. 

 TIM COOK SAYS MORE AIS ARE COMING TO APPLE INTELLIGENCE (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Apple plans to embed more third-party AI tools into its operating
systems. The company is on track to release an AI-upgraded Siri next
year. It is open to pursuing mergers and acquisitions if it thinks it
will advance its roadmap. The company recently released fourth quarter
earnings results that showed it raked in a record $102.5 billion over
the past few months, an 8% increase compared to the same period last
year.

 SPACEX AND BLUE ORIGIN BOTH SUBMITTED PLANS TO GET ASTRONAUTS BACK TO
THE MOON FASTER, NASA SAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX has pitched NASA a 'simplified mission' to put astronauts back
on the moon following criticisms over delays. The company is behind
schedule on building its lunar landing system for NASA's Artemis III
mission, which caused NASA to reopen the landing contract for the
mission. Blue Origin also submitted a plan. It has been developing a
lunar lander for NASA and plans to launch a smaller-scale version of
it, known as the Blue Moon Mark 1. 

 WORLD'S FIRST UNDERWATER HABITAT IN DECADES TO UNLOCK SECRETS OF 95%
OF OCEANS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 DEEP, a UK-based subsea engineering firm, has unveiled a prototype of
an underwater habitat designed to allow scientists to live and carry
out research beneath the sea's surface for days at a time. The
Vanguard pilot human habitat is part of an ambitious effort to make
long-term underwater living possible. The prototype can support up to
four crew members for up to a week. Currently, most expeditions can
only allow scientists to stay submerged for a few hours at a time.

 ML KIT'S PROMPT API: UNLOCK CUSTOM ON-DEVICE GEMINI NANO EXPERIENCES
(3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI is making it easier to create personalized app experiences. The ML
Kit GenAI Prompt API for Android enables developers to send natural
language and multimodal requests to Gemini Nano to support custom,
app-specific GenAI use cases. It allows developers to create unique
features with complex data transformation. The API uses Gemini Nano
on-device to process data locally, enabling offline capability and
improved user privacy. 

 SCALE DESIGN DECISIONS ACROSS TEAMS AND PRODUCTS (WEBSITE) [11] 

 The Design Tokens W3C Community Group (DTCG) is a community of
designers, developers, and tooling vendors that aims to standardize
how design tokens are defined and exchanged. It stewards the Design
Tokens specification so that teams can share visual language
reliability across design tools, code bases, and platforms. The first
stable version of the DTCG JSON format is now available. The format
unlocks interoperability and theming between tools.

 HUMANS NEED ENTROPY (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 As people get older, they tend to repeat the same patterns. The
solution to preventing this is to find sources of entropy. When we
were kids, everything was entropy because everything was new. As
adults, we need to constantly seek out the new to maximize the entropy
in our lives. 

 TAKING MONEY OFF THE TABLE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Employees who get compensated with shares sometimes have the
opportunity to sell a portion of them, but it can be difficult to
choose whether to sell or to roll the dice and risk it longer. They
should take the money while it's available. The amount will likely be
a life-changing amount of money, and there's never a guarantee that
their startup will succeed, even if it is looking good right now. The
money you take today can be invested in more steady growth.
