 APPLE TAKES CONTROL OF ALL CORE CHIPS IN IPHONE AIR WITH NEW
ARCHITECTURE TO PRIORITIZE AI (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The iPhone Air contains Apple's A19 Pro, N1, and C1X chips, making it
the most power-efficient iPhone ever made. The A19 Pro chip introduces
neural accelerators to each GPU core to increase compute power. The
N1, Apple's first wireless chip for the iPhone, has improved Wi-Fi
functionality that enables more power-efficient location tracking. The
C1X modem is up to twice as fast as the C1 and uses 30% less energy
than the Qualcomm modem in the iPhone 16 Pro. Using its own silicon
gives Apple more control, allowing it to do things beyond what it
could do by buying merchant silicon parts. 

 TESLA GIVES BIG HINT THAT IT WILL BUILD CYBER SUV, SMALLER CYBERTRUCK
(4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Cyber SUV and a smaller Cybertruck could potentially be added to
Tesla's lineup soon. While the company has not confirmed its plans for
the vehicles, a recent promotional video Tesla released seemed to show
a mock-up design of the Cyber SUV in plain sight. A smaller Cybertruck
design would allow fans in Europe and Asia to purchase the
all-electric pickup. There have been regulatory concerns in some
countries about the size and sharp edges of the Cybertruck, increasing
the need for an 'international' version.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 BUILDING NUCLEAR POWER IN THE US IS TOUGH. NASA WANTS TO DO IT ON THE
MOON (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The US, China, and Russia are racing to build a nuclear reactor on
the Moon. The countries have been exploring the idea of jointly
deploying nuclear energy on the Moon by the mid-2030s, but NASA
leaders are worried that a rival could potentially use its own station
to establish a keep-out zone on the lunar surface, limiting US efforts
to build up its own presence. NASA now aims to land a reactor on the
Moon by late 2029. The agency expects to lean on US industry to design
a reactor, get it to the Moon, and operate it. 

 MAKING REAL GAINS IN WAR ON ALZHEIMER'S (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 New technologies like AI are helping scientists find new ways to
understand and possibly help treat Alzheimer's disease. Scientists are
now looking at the possible role of lithium deficiency as a cause in
the onset and progression of the disease. The cost for care of
patients with the disease is estimated to increase to $1.5 trillion
per year by 2050. If scientists are unable to change the course of the
disease, then the only real treatment will be physical and palliative
care.

 AI, LLMS, AND OBSERVABILITY: 7 KEY INSIGHTS FROM GOOGLE'S DIRECTOR OF
AI AND DATADOG'S VP OF ENGINEERING (SPONSOR) [13] 

 Google's Director of AI Dr. Ali Arsanjani, and Datadog's VP of
Engineering Sajid Mehmood, sat down to discuss the current and future
states of AI, ML, and LLMs on Google Cloud. This guide distills the
top 7 insights and actions for technical leaders [13], covering
everything from upskilling teams to observability best practices. Read

 WHAT'S THE LIMIT OF WHAT CAN BE IN A TXT RECORD? (3 MINUTE READ) [14]


 TXT records contain multiple character-strings that are limited in
length. The size of a TXT record is limited by the size of the DNS
payload, which for TCP is up to 64KB. This could have security
implications as it allows attackers to tunnel large payloads to
browsers. 

 INTERCEPTION (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Interceptium is a proof of concept that routes web requests through a
large language model to generate custom outputs. It passes request
data to models that generate HTML that is returned to the browser.
These 'interceptors' can craft pages to users' needs and preferences
without any input. There are a lot of risks and challenges with this
approach, but the goal of the project was only to consider future
browser functionalities, as AI's ability to customize and adapt the
web is incredibly powerful.

 LOW-RISK DEFI CAN BE FOR ETHEREUM WHAT SEARCH WAS FOR GOOGLE (8
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 For a long time, there has been tension in the Ethereum community
between applications that bring in enough revenue to sustain the
ecosystem and applications that satisfy the underlying goals that
brought people to the ecosystem in the first place. Low-risk DeFi
fills both of these boxes at the same time. It could help Ethereum
achieve global democratized access to payments and savings in valuable
asset categories. Low-risk DeFi is already positively changing the
world in many underprivileged regions. 

 WHITE HOUSE OUTLINES A TIKTOK DEAL WITH A U.S. BOARD (5 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 The new TikTok deal will involve Oracle handling data and privacy,
and a new board for the company with a majority of American directors.
TikTok's recommendation algorithm will be 'controlled by America' but
it is unclear whether it will be licensed or altered. While the deal
hasn't been signed, it appears that China will support the framework.
