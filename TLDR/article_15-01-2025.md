 TIKTOK PREPARING FOR U.S. SHUT-OFF ON SUNDAY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 TikTok is planning to shut off its app for US users on Sunday. The
federal law banning the app only mandates a ban on new downloads -
existing users will still be able to use the app for some time. Users
will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information
about the ban. TikTok plans to give users the option to download all
of their data so they can take a record of their personal information
with them. 

 CHATGPT BECOMES MORE SIRI-LIKE WITH NEW SCHEDULED TASKS FEATURE (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI's new Tasks feature for ChatGPT allows users to direct the
chatbot to send reminders or to generate responses to specific prompts
at certain times. It is now available to Plus, Team, and Pro
subscribers. ChatGPT will sometimes suggest tasks, but they won't go
into effect unless the user approves them. Users can make changes to
assigned tasks through the chat conversation or through a new Tasks
section of the app. There is currently a 10-task limit.

 BOOM XB-1 PUSHES THE SOUND BARRIER BEFORE SUPERSONIC FLIGHT (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The Boom Supersonic XB-1 prototype reached a transonic speed of Mach
0.95 during Test Flight 11 on January 10. Transonic speed is when some
areas of the airflow over the airframe exceed the speed of sound.
During the flight, the XB-1 was subjected to dynamic pressures of up
to 383 Knots Equivalent Air Speed, which is a pressure greater than
what it would experience when flying supersonic at Mach 1.1. The
company has now completed 11 test flights, each incrementing to reach
supersonic speed. 

 2025 WILL SEE US CLOSER TO A WOOLLY MAMMOTH COMEBACK (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Colossal Biosciences, a company that aims to bring back extinct
species, says that it expects the first woolly mammoth calves to be
born within the next three years. The company plans to start with the
birthing of small mammals outside of the womb and then work up to the
birthing of elephants, which will pave the way for mammoth births.
While Colossal doesn't work on human applications for its technology,
it has acknowledged the potential of its technology for use in IVF
clinics. Colossal also plans to bring back the Tasmanian tiger and the
dodo - its long-term goal is to work with countries all over the world
to bring back extinct species and protect endangered animals.

that they want to better understand. 

 WHAT'S INVOLVED IN GETTING A "MODERN" TERMINAL SETUP? (11 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 A modern terminal needs to have multiline support for copy and paste,
infinite shell history, a useful prompt, 24-bit color, clipboard
integration, good autocomplete, colors in ls, themes, automatic
terminal fixing, key bindings, and the ability to use the scroll
wheel. This article discusses how to implement all these features into
a terminal. It explains why it makes certain recommendations and how
the setup benefits developers. There is no perfect way to configure
things in the terminal to make it compatible with every single other
thing, so developers need to try things out, figure out a locally
stable state that works for them, and accept that new tools might
disrupt their workflow.

 INSIDE META'S RACE TO BEAT OPENAI: “WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD
FRONTIER AND WIN THIS RACE (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Data scarcity has led AI developers to look for new ways to get
unique data. Documents from a major copyright lawsuit against Meta
show internal discussions about avoiding media coverage suggesting
that the company used a dataset it knew to be pirated. It reportedly
used the book piracy site LibGen to train its AI systems. The
documents hint that OpenAI and Mistral may also be using the library
for their models. Meta and other AI companies have previously argued
that using copyrighted material in training data should constitute
legal fair use.
