 APPLE RELEASES IOS 18.1 DEVELOPER BETA WITH THE FIRST ‚ÄòAPPLE
INTELLIGENCE' IPHONE FEATURES (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple's newly released developer betas for iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and
macOS Sequoia 15.1 contain the company's first set of AI features,
including a Siri with an updated design and ability to maintain
context across multiple requests, new Mail features like smart replay
and email summaries, and natural language search in Photos. The
features will likely not be rolled out to general users until well
into 2025. They will only work on the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max or on
iPads and Macs with Apple Silicon chips. Beta testers will need to
join a waitlist for access to the features. 

 YOUTUBE'S WAR ON AD BLOCKERS CONTINUES, NOW MAKING ADS TRULY
UNSKIPPABLE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Multiple YouTube users are reporting that the site is serving them
with blank ads or black screens before a video when they are using an
ad-blocker extension. The change makes users wait for their content,
partially defeating the purpose of using an ad blocker. YouTube began
testing server-side ad injection last month to further render ad
blockers obsolete. The solution inserts ads directly into the main
YouTube video feed so that ad blockers can no longer distinguish the
two pieces of media.

 SPACEX MOVING DRAGON SPLASHDOWNS TO PACIFIC TO SOLVE FALLING DEBRIS
PROBLEM (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SpaceX will begin returning its Dragon crew and cargo capsules to
splashdowns in the Pacific Ocean sometime next year and end recoveries
of the spacecraft off the coast of Florida. This will eliminate the
tiny risk that a piece of debris from the ship's trunk section might
fall on someone and cause damage, injury, or death. Debris from
several Dragon missions have been discovered on properties over the
past couple of years. SpaceX is unaware of any structure damage or
injuries caused by this debris.
