 FASTER RELEASES WITH AI-DRIVEN, HUMAN-VERIFIED AUTOMATED TESTING
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Low test coverage leaves critical flows untested and slows your
release velocity. Even with AI-assisted tools, teams can still
struggle to reach high coverage and maintain tests as products evolve.

QA WOLF [5]solves this with a hybrid model that blends AI TEST
GENERATION [6] with human expertise. Their multi-agent system uses
video, transcripts, DOM snapshots, browser logs, and 700+ evaluation
criteria built from 50,000,000 test runs.

With expert QA engineers reviewing every test, you get end-to-end
coverage that's accurate, stable, and always maintained.

Companies like Cohere, Drata, and AutoTrader rely on QA Wolf to keep
their releases on track.

 TIM COOK COULD STEP DOWN AS APPLE CEO ‘AS SOON AS NEXT YEAR' (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple's board and senior executives have recently intensified the
company's succession planning for its CEO role. John Ternus is the
most likely to take the position, but no final decisions have been
made. Apple is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings
report in late January. The transition to a new CEO is reportedly not
related to the company's current performance. 

 GROUP CHATGPT (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI has launched a limited test of its chat app in Japan, New
Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan. It will allow people to chat with AI
and other people within the same environment. Group chats are separate
from private conversations - personal ChatGPT memory will not be used
in group chats, and ChatGPT will not create memories from group chat
conversations. ChatGPT will automatically reduce exposure to sensitive
content for everyone in the chat if any of the members is under 18.

 WORLD'S OLDEST RNA EXTRACTED FROM ICE AGE WOOLLY MAMMOTH (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Researchers at Stockholm University have successfully sequenced the
RNA of a young woolly mammoth discovered in 2010. This allowed them to
explore new information, such as which genes were active, or whether
it was infected with RNA-based viruses, when it died. The ability to
recover RNA gives scientists another tool to reconstruct and validate
ancient genomes. It could be used to explore how gene expression
differs between extinct and living species or even between individuals
of the same species. 

 ALMOST EVERYTHING ABOUT NASA'S LATEST MISSION TO MARS IS UNUSUAL (12
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 NASA's ESCAPADE mission, which launched on Thursday towards Mars,
will collect data to provide clues about why the planet became cold,
dry, and almost airless. The mission was initially rejected when it
was proposed, and then it was only approved because of a federal
government shutdown in 2018. The mission was delayed several times,
but the lessons learned along the way could help NASA get more bang
for its buck for future missions. The trajectory the mission is
pioneering allows launches to be made outside of tight launch windows.

 THIS THANKSGIVING, BE GRATEFUL FOR NEVER HAVING TO WRITE TESTS AGAIN

Meticulous. [12] It observes your app and automatically build a

happen. 

 BUILDING A UI FRAMEWORK (BOOK) [13] 

 This document looks at how to create a graphical UI framework that
considers developer adoption, performance, display effects, and power
consumption. The most popular frameworks solve real problems. It is
important to ground design in real projects with real customers, be
open to new ideas, and be ready to discard inventions to go where the
data leads. The most difficult part of designing a product is
balancing a coherent vision with flexibility in the face of new
information. 

 THE FATE OF “SMALL” OPEN SOURCE (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The era of small, low-value libraries is over. AI can output
functions from these libraries, so developers no longer have to take
on extra dependencies with unknown performance, maintenance, and
supply-chain risks just for basic functionalities. There is still
plenty of open source to write. The most value can be found in big
projects, more inventive projects, or niche areas not covered in large
language model training data.

 GROK 5 WILL BE RELEASED IN Q1 NEXT YEAR (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Elon Musk recently attended an interview where he discussed his
vision for artificial intelligence, robotics, sustainable development,
and the future of humanity. He revealed details about Grok 5, a
6-trillion parameter model which will be released in the first quarter
of next year. Musk also talked about building a giant wafer factory
within the next couple of years to create tens of billions of AI
chips. This article contains excerpts from the interview. 

 META IS ABOUT TO START GRADING WORKERS ON THEIR AI SKILLS (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Meta plans to tie employee performance to their 'AI-driven impact'
starting next year. The company will assess employees on how they use
AI to deliver results and build tools that can move the needle in a
major way in regards to productivity. Meta is rolling out an 'AI
Performance Assistant' to help with performance reviews and feedback
to use in this year's performance review cycle. Employees can also use
Meta's internal assistant, Metamate, as well as Google Gemini, for
their performance content.
