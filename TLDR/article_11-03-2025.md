 ERIC SCHMIDT JOINS RELATIVITY SPACE AS CEO (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google's former CEO Eric Schmidt is now CEO of Relativity Space, a
9-year-old rocket startup - this is Schmidt's first CEO job since he
left Google nearly 15 years ago. Schmidt has made a significant
investment in Relativity Space and has a controlling stake in the
company. Tim Ellis, co-founder and former CEO of Relativity Space,
will continue to support the company as a director on the company's
board. Relativity Space is gearing up for the launch of its Terran R
rocket, scheduled for 2026. The company has so far struck nearly $3
billion in launch contracts with customers. 

 APPLE READIES DRAMATIC SOFTWARE OVERHAUL FOR IPHONE, IPAD, AND MAC (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Apple is planning to transform the interface for the iPhone, iPad,
and Mac for a new generation of users later this year. The revamp will
fundamentally change the look of Apple's operating systems and make
the company's software platforms more consistent. The company is
working to simplify the way users navigate and control their devices.
The new design is loosely based on the Vision Pro's software. Apple is
betting that a breakthrough new interface will help spur demand after
a dip in sales.

 OZEMPIC'S NEW FRONTIER: THE WAR ON AGING (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A growing body of research indicates that GLP-1 drugs, like Ozempic,
show promise in preventing age-related conditions like Alzheimer's,
osteoarthritis, and certain cancers. The class of drugs works by
suppressing appetite and reducing inflammation, which may potentially
contribute to their preventive health benefits. More robust studies
are still needed to confirm the causal effects of GLP-1s on longevity
and healthspan. 

 MICROPLASTICS HINDER PLANT PHOTOSYNTHESIS, STUDY FINDS, THREATENING
MILLIONS WITH STARVATION (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Microplastic pollution is significantly cutting food supplies by
damaging plants' ability to photosynthesize. Between 4% to 14% of the
world's staple crops are currently estimated to be lost due to the
pervasive particles. The effect could get worse as more microplastics
enter the environment. The world is already facing a challenge to
produce sufficient food sustainably, and it is also facing crop losses
due to climate change. These adverse effects are highly likely to
extend from food security to planetary health - reduced photosynthesis
may also cut the amount of carbon dioxide taken from the atmosphere.

 CLAUDE CODE IS EXPENSIVE, RECKLESS, AND WEIRDLY FUN (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Cursor is the clear winner when precise context is crucial, but
Claude Code excels in vibe coding. Vibe coding is when you interact
more than you read or write code - it is a development mode that is
somewhat reckless, but fun. This approach gets expensive, but it is
far less cognitively intense. Claude Code excels at boring tasks and
at extending features, but due to lower supervision by design, it
suits smaller or less critical projects at best. It is relatively
expensive compared to more comprehensive tools. 

 I QUIT MY FAANG JOB BECAUSE IT'LL BE AUTOMATED BY THE END OF 2025 (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The evidence points to a scenario where engineering and other pure
knowledge works will soon be mostly done by AI agents. Those who
formerly held jobs that AI took over will act as AI agent wranglers.
There are still factors of production other than intelligence, many
that are intrinsically tied to being a human, that should retain
economic value. There are many jobs that, even if they could be done
very well by AI systems, people wouldn't want to use AI systems to do
them, for example, sales.

 THE MODEL IS THE PRODUCT (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Generalist scaling is stalling, opinionated training is working much
better than expected, and inference costs are in free fall. Investors
have been betting on the application layer, which is likely to be the
first to be automated in disrupted in the next stage of AI evolution.
AI companies that form a complete upstream and downstream industrial
ecosystem will not need to make their own applications. Big labs will
likely shift partnerships from API customers to contractors involved
in the earlier training stage. 

 HOW THE AI TALENT RACE IS RESHAPING THE TECH JOB MARKET (3 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 The debut of ChatGPT was a turning point for the AI job market. Many
more companies became aware of the power of integrating AI into
products and workflows. New AI-related postings rose 68% between the
time ChatGPT was released through to the end of last year while tech
postings were down 27% over the same period. Engineers without AI
skills can still fare well in the job market, but AI skills tend to
fetch premium pay and job security.
