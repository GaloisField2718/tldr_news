 WAYMO MIGHT BE WILLING TO SELL YOU A SELF-DRIVING CAR, SAYS SUNDAR
PICHAI (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Waymo's long-term business plans include the possibility of personal
ownership. The company recently expanded testing to Japan and plans to
introduce robotaxis in Austin this summer. Waymo previously floated
the idea of selling self-driving cars when it made a deal with
Chrysler in 2018 to build self-driving Pacifica minivans. Tesla also
aims to release a personal self-driving car - it announced at an event
last year that the Cybercab will be available by 2026 for $30,000. 

 AS COMPANIES BEGIN CIRCLING CHROME, GOOGLE CLAIMS NONE OF THEM CAN
HANDLE ITS BROWSER LIKE IT DOES (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google claims that it is the only company capable of running Chrome
effectively due to complex service integrations. Separating the
browser from the company's servers could make some features unusable.
Despite Google's claims, experts believe that a Chrome divestiture is
technically feasible. There are many parties interested in buying
Chrome, including OpenAI and Yahoo.

 ROBOT DEXTERITY STILL SEEMS HARD (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Humanoid robots are becoming increasingly capable as more and more
companies invest hundreds of millions of dollars into the technology.
Some are now being tested in the field to see if they can do useful
work. Humanoid robots can now dance, run, and do flips, but while
manipulation capabilities are improving, they still have a long way to
go. While it's possible to automate any specific task, building a
robot that can flexibly perform a variety of actions in a novel or
highly variable environment is much harder.

 CHINA'S HUAWEI DEVELOPS NEW AI CHIP, SEEKING TO MATCH NVIDIA (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Huawei's new Ascend 910D AI chip could be more powerful than Nvidia's
H100, a popular chip used for AI training. It is still in early
development and still needs to be tested to assess performance. The
company will receive its first batch of samples of the processor as
soon as late May. Huawei faces challenges in producing its chips - it
has been cut off from TSMC and China's closest alternative is blocked
from purchasing the most advanced chip-making equipment. 

 TECH WORKERS ARE JUST LIKE THE REST OF US: MISERABLE AT WORK (12
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Tech positions nowadays are starting to look like regular jobs.
Workers are contending with the constant fear of layoffs, longer
hours, and increasing responsibilities for the same pay. A few years
ago, tech talent was so in demand that some people were being hired to
do virtually nothing. Employees are now doing the work of multiple
laid-off colleagues. Changing jobs used to be a surefire way to secure
a raise, but now, asking for more money can lead to a job offer being
withdrawn.
