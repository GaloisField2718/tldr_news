 OPENAI STAFFERS TO SELL $6 BILLION IN STOCK TO SOFTBANK, OTHER
INVESTORS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Current and former OpenAI employees who spent at least two years in
the company may have the opportunity to sell approximately $6 billion
worth of shares to an investor group that includes Thrive Capital,
SoftBank Group Corp., and Dragoneer Investment Group. The deal would
value OpenAI at $500 billion. Talks for the deal are still in an early
stage, and the size of the sale could still change. The sale will
allow OpenAI employees a chance to get cash-rich amid a high-stakes
talent war in the artificial intelligence industry. 

 THE PALANTIR MAFIA BEHIND SILICON VALLEY'S HOTTEST STARTUPS (9 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Several ex-Palantir employees are now founders at some of the
buzziest startups in Silicon Valley. These founders lean on other
ex-Palantir executives and engineers for support and financing.
Palantir is a data analysis firm that works with the US military and
intelligence agencies. Some venture capital funds' only mission is to
invest in companies founded by people with Palantir experience. This
article looks at the so-called Palantir mafia and the companies they
have started.

 SPACEX REVEALS WHY THE LAST TWO STARSHIPS FAILED AS ANOTHER LAUNCH
DRAWS NEAR (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX has received launch approval for the 10th full-scale test
flight of its Starship rocket. The launch is scheduled for no earlier
than August 24 at 6:30 pm local time in Texas. Starship's record in
2025 so far has not been great, with four failed test flights and the
explosion and destruction of another Starship vehicle during a ground
test in June. A good outcome on the text Starship test flight will
give SpaceX footing to continue to step forward on its roadmap. 

 BIOTECH'S LOST ARCHIVE (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 FDA submissions contain unparalleled details about the design of
clinical trials, manufacturing processes, safety assessments, and
reviewer correspondences, but this information is not publicly
available. This article details a proposal for a legally grounded
mechanism for democratizing FDA filings. Freeing FDA submissions from
obscurity would level the playing field for small biotech firms,
academic teams, and nonprofits and enable AI-driven regulatory
intelligence tools that dramatically lower compliance costs and
accelerate approval timelines. AI stands to revolutionize drug
development, but only if it can be trained on high-quality unredacted
datasets.

 EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT GOOD SYSTEM DESIGN (22 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Good system design is about knowing how to use boring, well-tested
components in the right place. Using exciting tools will usually end
up in a mess. There are very few instances where you want to do the
kind of system design that you could talk about at a conference.
Boring system design is much more common. 

 BUILDING A WEB SEARCH ENGINE FROM SCRATCH IN TWO MONTHS WITH 3
BILLION NEURAL EMBEDDINGS (34 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Search engines seem to be getting worse. Better quality results
should rank higher than the prolific inorganic content and engagement
bait everywhere today. Transformer-based text embedding models show
amazing natural comprehension of language - this technology can be
used to find great content, insights, and references. This article
details a project where a developer tries to build a web search engine
from scratch using neural embeddings. Embeddings appear far more
powerful than traditional search.

 35 THOUGHTS ABOUT AGI AND 1 ABOUT GPT-5 (27 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 GPT-5's release felt uneventful. It is still not Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), and it still gets things wrong - the model is
supposed to be able to decide for itself whether it needs to use its
thinking mode for harder problems, but many reports show that it often
gets this wrong. Large language models perform well with crystallized
knowledge, which masks their shortcomings with fluid intelligence. AGI
has the potential to change how we do everything very soon after it is
achieved, but we still have to figure out how to get there. 

 CHINA'S VISION FOR A DRIVERLESS FUTURE IS MILES AHEAD OF EVERYONE
ELSE'S (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 China's autonomous vehicle industry is nearing a tipping point. The
country is already the world's largest auto market and a global leader
in electric and autonomous vehicles. By 2030, a fifth of new cars sold
in China will be fully driverless, and 70% will feature advanced
assisted-driving technology. The country's push to build
infrastructure gives it a significant advantage in deploying
autonomous vehicles. Its AV market shows no sign of slowing - many
regions will want to partner with China to upgrade their
infrastructure.
