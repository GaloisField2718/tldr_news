 STRIPE ACQUIRES STABLECOIN PLATFORM BRIDGE FOR $1.1 BILLION IN
CRYPTO'S LARGEST ACQUISITION (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Payments company Stripe has acquired stablecoin platform Bridge for
$1.1 billion in the largest acquisition in the crypto industry to
date. Bridge was previously valued at $200 million. Stripe recently
reinstated crypto payments for US businesses via USDC on Ethereum,
Solana, and Polygon. It also inked a partnership with Coinbase that
required Stripe to incorporate Coinbase's Base Layer 2 network into
its crypto payment products and Coinbase to add Stripe as a way for
its customers to buy crypto within its Coinbase Wallet. 

 OPENAI, MICROSOFT REPORTEDLY HIRE BANKS TO RENEGOTIATE PARTNERSHIP
TERMS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI and Microsoft have both hired investment banks to help revise
the terms of their partnership as OpenAI plans to restructure to
reincorporate its for-profit arm as a benefit corporation and remove
caps that previously limited investors' returns. The negotiations are
said to focus on how big of a stake Microsoft will receive in OpenAI
following the restructuring. Microsoft has invested over $13 billion
into OpenAI since 2019. The current terms of the partnership say that
Microsoft will receive most of OpenAI's initial profits until it
recoups its investment. OpenAI doesn't expect to become profitable
until 2029.

 IT'S TIME TO BUILD THE EXOPLANET TELESCOPE (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Starship is designed to launch at least 150 metric tons to low Earth
orbit at an exceptionally low cost with a launch cadence high enough
to ultimately deliver over one million metric tons per year. This will
transform human logistical capacity in space and allow for greatly
reduced space development costs. It would enable humanity to develop a
self-assembling and ever-growing telescope in space. This telescope
would be able to resolve features on the surface of exoplanets and
reveal continents, mountain ranges, river systems, seasonal variations
in plants and animals, and more. 

 US STARTUP CHARGING COUPLES TO ‘SCREEN EMBRYOS FOR IQ' (7 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Heliospect Genomics is a US startup that offers embryo screening
services. The company allows couples to rank up to 100 embryos based
on IQ, section, height, risk of obesity, risk of mental illness, and
other traits. Its services cost up to $50,000. The company's offers
represent an ethical minefield. Selecting embryos based on predicted
IQ is legal in the US, but not in some other countries like the UK.

 HOW SAN FRANCISCO LEARNED TO LOVE SELF-DRIVING CARS (10 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Self-driving cars have won over San Francisco after a rocky start a
year and a half ago. The company is currently serving over 100,000
paid rides a week across Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco. It
opened its service to everyone in San Francisco this past summer.
Waymo rides generally cost slightly more than Uber or Lyft, but users
don't have to tip drivers, making the three apps' prices competitive.
The company is already retaining riders at a higher rate than
competitors while operating on a much smaller scale. 

 DID AUTOMATTIC COMMIT OPEN SOURCE THEFT? (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Automattic, the VC-funded company behind WordPress, is in a
full-blown corporate conflict with WP Engine, a popular managed
WordPress hosting service. As part of the conflict, Automattic forked
a popular plugin made by WP Engine, replaced the plugin in the plugin
directory, and is migrating over 2 million of the plugin's customers
silently onto the fork. The reviews for the plugin have remained as if
nothing has changed and any reviews pointing out the heist are being
actively removed. The silent change, aimed at reducing WP Engine's
revenue, broke some production sites. The incident is a nightmare
scenario for companies serious about supply chain security - the
WordPress.org plugin directory is no longer reliable.
