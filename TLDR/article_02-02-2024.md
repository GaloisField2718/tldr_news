 ELON MUSK SAYS TESLA WILL HOLD A SHAREHOLDER VOTE TO INCORPORATE IN
TEXAS AFTER DELAWARE PAY SNUB (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla is holding a shareholder vote on whether the company should
transfer its state of incorporation to Texas. The company is currently
incorporated in Delaware. The vote comes after a Delaware judge voided
Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package granted in 2018. A decision to
reincorporate could be challenged by shareholders as a breach of
fiduciary duty according to Delaware law as it could be seen as a
choice made for selfish reasons. 

 THE ARC BROWSER IS GETTING BETTER BOOKMARKS AND SEARCH RESULTS, ALL
THANKS TO AI (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Browser Company has made some big AI-powered changes to its Arc
desktop browser. The new features turn search queries into bookmarks
and keep users up to date on things they care about. The Browser
Company aims to make some of the many-step processes of using the
internet simpler, faster, more intuitive, and more useful. A video
explaining Arc's new features is available in the article.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 FOR THE FIRST TIME NASA HAS ASKED INDUSTRY ABOUT PRIVATE MISSIONS TO
MARS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NASA is taking its first steps towards opening a commercial pathway
to Mars. Jet Propulsion Laboratory has issued a new solicitation
titled 'Exploring Mars Together: Commercial Services Studies'. The
request asks for proposals from the US space industry on how they
would complete one of four private missions to Mars. The missions
include delivering small satellites to orbit and providing imaging
services around the red planet. NASA plans to award multiple contracts
of $200,000 for one study or up to $300,000 for a maximum of two
studies. Details about the studies are available in the article. 

 NEW TYPE OF CHERRY TOMATO SELF-DRIES WHILE STILL ON THE VINE (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Supree, a food tech company, has created tomatoes with microscopic
cracks in their skin that allow moisture to naturally evaporate from
within them, resulting in tomatoes that have lost 80% of their
original weight by the time they're packed. The tomatoes can be dried
further after harvest to tweak their content, but that process doesn't
involve the use of any additives. The dried tomatoes can be reportedly
kept for a year after being frozen for shipping and storage without
any negative effect on their taste, texture, or nutritional value.
Supree will sell its product directly to corporate clients for now.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 ACCESSKIT (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 AccessKit provides UI accessibility infrastructure across platforms
and programming languages. It features a data schema that defines all
of the data required to make a UI accessible to screen readers and
other assistive technologies. The schema, largely based on Chromium's
cross-platform accessibility abstraction, also defines actions that
can be requested by assistive technologies. 

 STANCHION (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Stanchion is an SQLite 3 extension that enables column-oriented
storage in SQLite. It brings all of the benefits of column-oriented
storage and data warehousing to anywhere SQLite is already deployed.
Column-oriented storage outperforms row-oriented storage for storing
and processing metric, log, and event data, time series data storage
and analysis, change tracking, and anchor modeling. Stanchion uses
compression techniques that significantly reduce the size of stored
data, greatly reducing the cost of large data sets.

 WHY TIM COOK IS GOING ALL IN ON THE APPLE VISION PRO (22 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 When Tim Cook first experienced the Apple Vision Pro maybe eight
years ago, it needed a supercomputer in the other room to run. Over
the years, Apple engineers shrunk the device to a pair of goggles that
weigh a little more than a box of spaghetti. This article talks about
what using the Vision Pro is like. The device's high-resolution
displays can overlay digital objects that look real. 

 GOOGLE IS PREPARING TO FULLY RENAME BARD TO GEMINI (2 MINUTE READ)
[12]

switching entirely to 'Gemini'. All of Bard's phone experience was
renamed 'Gemini' earlier this week. The app now says 'Bard is now
Gemini' across mobile devices and the web. Bard is powered by Gemini
Pro, the middle option in Google's newest family of AI models.
