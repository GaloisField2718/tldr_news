 ELON MUSK'S XAI ACTIVATES ‚ÄúMOST POWERFUL AI TRAINING CLUSTER IN THE
WORLD‚Äù WITH 100K NVIDIA H100 GPUS (2 MINUTE READ) [8]

H100 GPUs in Memphis, Tennessee. It is effectively the most powerful
AI training cluster in the market today. The supercomputer is expected
to be used to train Grok, the company's large language model. xAI is

xAI also recently announced that it is hiring to increase its human
talent advantage. 

 ALEXA IS IN MILLIONS OF HOUSEHOLDS‚ÄîAND AMAZON IS LOSING BILLIONS
(13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While hundreds of millions of customers own Alexa-enabled devices,
Amazon's bet that people would spend meaningful amounts of money to
buy goods on its platform by talking to the voice assistant hasn't
paid off. Customers mostly use Alexa to set alarms and check the
weather. Amazon has lost tens of billions of dollars on its devices
business. The company will launch a paid tier for Alexa as soon as
this month as part of the plan to reverse these losses.

 CHINA UNVEILS WORLD'S 1ST MELTDOWN-PROOF NUCLEAR REACTOR WITH 105 MW
CAPACITY (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers at Tsinghua University in China have successfully
demonstrated a meltdown-proof nuclear fission reactor. The twin
reactor design can generate 105 MW of power each. It can cool itself
down without an external power source, reaching stable temperatures
around 35 hours after shutdown. Construction of the facility started
in 2016, with commercial operations beginning only in December last
year. One drawback of the technology is that it can't be retrofitted
onto existing nuclear reactors. 

 WE'RE BUILDING NUCLEAR SPACESHIPS AGAIN‚ÄîTHIS TIME FOR REAL (23
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Powering spaceships using compact reactors could cut down Mars
transit times by more than half. The technology also has military
applications, with DARPA requesting a nuclear rocket demonstrator in
June 2020. The Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations
(DRACO) project aims to create space-based assets that can move
quickly within space to deter strategic attacks by adversaries. This
article discusses the DRACO project and the technologies that make it
possible.

 ETHEREUM ETFS APPROVED BY SEC, BRINGING POPULAR FUNDS TO
SECOND-LARGEST CRYPTOCURRENCY (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 US regulators have approved spot exchange-traded funds that hold
Ethereum. Bitcoin ETFs, which were approved in January, have attracted
tens of billions of dollars of investment. Some analysts predict that
inflows into ETH ETFs won't be nearly as high as for BTC ETFs.
Ethereum doesn't have the first-mover advantage that Bitcoin had and
it lacks a strong narrative. 

 WHY TECHNICAL COFOUNDERS REJECT YOU (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 There are many reasons technical cofounders will reject a startup.
This article discusses some of these factors, such as unrealistic
expectations from founders, putting too much value on an idea, or a
lack of understanding of the market. Building a compelling case for a
technical cofounder to want to join a founder involves providing proof
that the idea or product will work and that the founder is able to
bring the idea to life. Founders need to prove that they will be
successful and that the train is departing.
