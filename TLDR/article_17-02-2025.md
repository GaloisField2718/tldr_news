 ⏳ SLOW QA CYCLES ARE KILLING YOUR RELEASE SPEED (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Mobile QA cycles are painfully slow when testing is manual. Teams are
stuck testing on personal devices, struggling to cover real-world
scenarios, and losing entire weeks just to prep a release.

Worse, thorough testing often means CUTTING RELEASES A WEEK IN ADVANCE
just to catch bugs before submitting to the app stores.

QA Wolf [5]eliminates these bottlenecks. With FULLY MANAGED AUTOMATED
TESTING ON REAL IOS DEVICES AND ANDROID SIMULATORS [6], we cut QA
cycles from days to 15 MINUTES OR LESS—guaranteed flake-free [7].

Reclaim your release speed. Stop wasting weeks on testing.

 META IS REPORTEDLY WORKING ON HUMANOID ROBOTS THAT HELP WITH CHORES
(3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meta is reportedly creating a new team within its Reality Labs
hardware division that will build robot hardware. The company's
long-term goal is to create the platform that the industry uses. It
will make the underlying sensors, AI, and software for other companies
to put inside their hardware. The core technologies that Meta has
invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to
the development of the advancements needed for robotics. 

 REDDIT CEO SAYS PAYWALLS ARE COMING SOON (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Reddit's CEO Steve Huffman said during a video Ask Me Anything
Session recently that the platform is actively testing ways to make
some content paid. Reddit is planning to roll out a 'paid subreddit'
feature later this year. The paid content model is still a work in
progress - there are many issues to work out, such as how paid
subreddits will be moderated, as volunteer moderators likely won't
want to watch over paid content if they aren't getting paid
themselves. It may be possible for Reddit to allow creators to put
certain content behind paywalls - lots of creators have their own
subreddits, which allow community conversation in a way that comments
on Patreon posts don't totally allow for.

 MINIATURIZED CRISPR PACKS A MIGHTY GENE EDITING PUNCH (5 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 One of the biggest issues with CRISPR-Cas9 is that the system is too
large, making it difficult to deliver the gene editor. Mammoth
Biosciences' NanoCas is a version of the CRISPR-Cas9 system that is
roughly one-third the size of the original, allowing the tool to be
used for gene therapy inside muscles, the brain, the heart, and other
tissues. The team is already exploring the system's potential for
targeting brain diseases. The technology could be modified for use in
epigenetic or base editing. 

 THE BLUE GHOST LUNAR LANDER IS NOW ORBITING THE MOON, TAKING DAZZLING
PHOTOGRAPHS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 NASA's Blue Ghost lander is now orbiting the Moon as it prepares to
make a landing on March 2. The lander holds 10 payloads - a list is
available in the article. NASA also launched a rover from a Japanese
company along with Blue Ghost that will carry five payloads. The rover
will land at the Atlas crater in Mare Frigoris and use its equipment
to conduct food production experiments, detect radiation, conduct
water electrolysis, and collect regolith.

 SUNSETTING CREATE REACT APP (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Create React App currently has no active maintainers and there are
many existing programs that solve the same problems, so it is being
deprecated. It will continue working in maintenance mode. Frameworks
like Next.js, React Router, and Expo are recommended for new projects.
Links to adoption guides for migrating apps from Create React App to
Next.js, React Router, and Expo are available in the article. 

 FROM WEB DEVELOPER TO DATABASE DEVELOPER IN 10 YEARS (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 This article details Phil Eaton's journey from a web developer to a
database developer and the decisions made along the way. Eaton was a
web developer from 2014 to 2012 and a hands-on engineering manager
from 2017 to 2021. He tried to start a company in 2021 but left in
2023 to be a co-founder at TigerBeetle. This experience eventually led
to him becoming a database developer.

 THE INSIDE STORY OF HOW ALTMAN AND MUSK WENT FROM FRIENDS TO BITTER
ENEMIES (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sam Altman and Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015. Their
relationship soured in 2018, and Musk left after a power struggle. The
rivalry intensified when Musk launched his own AI startup, xAI,
following the release of ChatGPT. Musk recently followed the Stargate
unveiling by making a hostile $97.4 billion bid for the assets of the
nonprofit that controls OpenAI. This article looks at Altman and
Musk's rivalry through conversations with more than a dozen people
familiar with their relationship over the years. 

 INSIDE AMAZON'S MESSY PUSH TO BRING EVERYONE BACK TO THE OFFICE (8
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Amazon told hundreds of thousands of workers to come back to the
office full-time, but it didn't have enough desks to go around. Some
employees don't have any teammates in the same location, so they are
fighting other employees for private rooms to make video calls. This
article looks at how Amazon's policy for employees to return to the
office or find somewhere else to work has turned out. The company is
short on desks and parking and employees report that the initiative
hasn't helped them become more collaborative.
