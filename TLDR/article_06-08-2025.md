  🚀 FASTER MOBILE RELEASES WITH AUTOMATED QA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on mobile devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-NATIVE SERVICE delivers 80% automated test coverage
in weeks [6], with tests running on REAL IOS DEVICES and ANDROID
EMULATORS—all in 100% parallel with zero flakes. [7]

 	* QA cycles reduced to just 15 minutes
 	* Multi-device + gesture interactions fully supported
 	* Reliable test execution with zero flakes
 	* Human-verified bug reports

No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No more bugs
reaching production.

 ANTHROPIC UNVEILS MORE POWERFUL AI MODEL AHEAD OF RIVAL GPT-5 RELEASE
(2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anthropic's new model, Opus 4.1, is more capable at coding, research,
and data analysis and better at fielding complex multistep problems
than previous versions. It can better navigate large codebases and
make more precise modifications to code. Opus 4.1 scores two
percentage points higher than its predecessor on SWE-Bench Verified, a
popular coding evaluation benchmark. Anthropic is currently finalizing
a deal to raise as much as $5 billion in a new funding round at a
valuation of $170 billion. 

 OPENAI'S NEW OPEN WEIGHT (APACHE 2) MODELS ARE REALLY GOOD (15 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's long-awaited open weight models have been released. The 120B
model achieves near-party with OpenAI o4-mini on core reasoning
benchmarks while running efficiently on a single 80 GB GPU. The 20B
model delivers similar results to OpenAI o3-mini on common benchmarks
and can run on edge devices with just 16 GB of memory. Both models are
mixture-of-experts. It is likely that OpenAI now offers the best
available open weights models.

 OZEMPIC SHOWS ANTI-AGING EFFECTS IN FIRST CLINICAL TRIAL, REVERSING
BIOLOGICAL AGE BY 3.1 YEARS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ozempic demonstrated remarkable anti-agent effects in a randomized
controlled trial involving 108 people with HIV-associated
lipohypertrophy, a condition characterized by excess fat accumulation
and accelerated cellular aging. The researchers used epigenetic clocks
to assess biological aging and found that those on semaglutide became
3.1 years biologically younger on average by the end of the study. The
anti-aging effects weren't uniform across all body systems - the most
dramatic improvements occurred in the inflammatory system and brain.
The researchers believe that the anti-aging properties of semaglutide
stem from its effects on fat distribution and metabolic health. 

 FIRST EVIDENCE OF MICROPLASTIC MOBILIZATION IN A HUMAN SUBJECT – A
SELF-EXPERIMENT (17 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Microplastics are everywhere. Studies show that microplastic burden
strongly correlates with negative health outcomes. This post presents
an experimental protocol that tricks cells into releasing
microplastics back into the blood, where they can be transported to
the liver for biliary excretion or actively removed with plasma
exchange. It involves using a compound derived from broccoli as a
microplastics mobilizer.

 STAGEWISE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 stagewise is a frontend coding agent for production codebases.
Developers just have to tell the agent what they want to change, click
on elements to let the agent know where a change should happen, and
then stagewise does the rest. stagewise can be customized with
plugins, and it is compatible with all kinds of frameworks. It
features a dedicated frontend agent, but developers can use any other
compatible agent through stagewise's open agent interface. 

 ADOPTING CLAUDE CODE: RIDING THE SOFTWARE ECONOMICS SINGULARITY (12
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Programming is quickly changing. Claude Code fundamentally changed
what is possible when working at scale. AI has removed a lot of
friction in the development process, allowing tasks that weren't worth
tackling before to be completed. However, when coding speed stops
being the limiting factor, new bottlenecks emerge. The constraint now
isn't how fast features can be implemented, it's how quickly decisions
can be made about what to build.

 DEEPMIND REVEALS GENIE 3 “WORLD MODEL” THAT CREATES REAL-TIME
INTERACTIVE SIMULATIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google DeepMind's Genie 3 model can create interactive worlds from
prompts or images. It can create continuously generated environments
that can be changed on the fly. The ability to create alterable 3D
environments could make games more dynamic for players and offer
developers new ways to prove out concepts and level designs. Examples
of environments generated by the model are available in the article. 

 IGNORE PREVIOUS DIRECTIONS 5: HARDWARE HAS CHANGED (6 MINUTE READ)

 Writing code that runs efficiently is hard. Hardware has improved
significantly in the past few years. GenAI has accelerated this
hardware transformation. The software side has a lot of work to do to
catch up with the reality of the hardware.
