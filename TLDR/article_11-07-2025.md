 ROBOT SURGERY ON HUMANS COULD BE TRIALLED WITHIN DECADE AFTER SUCCESS
ON PIG ORGANS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An AI-trained robot recently completed eight operations on pig organs
with a 100% success rate. The robot, armed with tools to cut, clip,
and grab soft tissue, successfully removed pig gall bladders without
human help. They were trained on video footage of human medics
conducting operations using organs taken from dead pigs. The success
opens up the possibility of replicating, en masse, the skills of the
best surgeons in the world.

 HOW MUCH AI CODING TOOLS SPEED UP EXPERIENCED OPEN-SOURCE DEVELOPERS
(1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A randomized controlled trial found that developers were actually 19%
slower when they had access to AI than when they didn't. The results
were surprising, as developers thought they were 20% faster with AU
tools. The study asked 16 developers with moderate AI experience to
complete 246 tasks in large and complex projects on which they had an
average of five years of prior experience. A chart showing the results
of the study is available.
