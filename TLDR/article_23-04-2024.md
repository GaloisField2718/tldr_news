 APPLE WORKING TO SECURE STREAMING RIGHTS TO FIFA CLUB WORLD CUP (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is working to secure an exclusive TV deal with FIFA, who plans
to launch a revamped version of Club World Cup in 2025. Apple wants
the TV rights to the event, which will feature 32 teams from each of
the six confederations. The first tournament will take place in the US
next summer. The deal could be worth around $1 billion. Apple has
already paid $2.5 billion to secure global broadcasting rights to
Major League Soccer and it has also secured a deal with Major League
Baseball. The company sees live sports as a way to lure new customers
to the Apple TV+ streaming service.

 GENERATIVE A.I. ARRIVES IN THE GENE EDITING WORLD OF CRISPR (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Profluent, a Berkeley startup, has used generative AI technology to
create new gene editors based on CRISPR. The company has used one of
the AI-generated gene editors to edit human DNA, but it has yet to put
any of them through clinical trials. While Profluent plans to open
source the gene editors generated by its AI technology, it will not be
open sourcing the AI technology itself. The project is part of a wider
effort to build AI technologies that improve medical care. 

 MEET QDEL, THE BACKLIGHT-LESS DISPLAY TECH THAT COULD REPLACE OLED IN
PREMIUM TVS (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Quantum dot electroluminescent (QDEL) screens produce wide color
spaces and are bright, affordable, and resistant to burn-in. Also
known as NanoLED, the technology is being eyed as one of the most
potentially influential developments for consumer displays over the
next two years. There aren't any QDEL products yet and they may not be
released for a while yet. This article explains how the technology
works, looks at its advantages, and explores competing technologies.

 GOOD IDEAS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Programmers love to argue for their favorite technologies, but there
are some ideas that are universally agreed on. This article provides a
list of ideas within computer science that are universally considered
good and the year each idea appeared. These ideas are so widespread
and effective that many may not even think of them as being invented.
The list focuses on ideas, not implementations, so some things like
Unix aren't on the list. Some example items from the list include
binary numbers, boolean algebra, arrays, and version control.

READ) [14] 

 Meta plans to partner with external hardware companies to build
virtual reality headsets using its Meta Horizon operating system. The
move will result in new hardware devices that run on the same
operating system and software as Meta's current first-party virtual
reality hardware. It will recreate the Android versus iOS dynamic in
smartphones with virtual reality headsets. Apple will soon have to
compete against a range of different hardware devices at various
prices, all running on Meta's operating system. 

 SAM ALTMAN INVESTS IN ENERGY STARTUP FOCUSED ON AI DATA CENTERS (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sam Altman and other investors, including venture capital firm
Andreessen Horowitz, have put $20 million into Exowatt, a company that
aims to provide big data centers with clean energy. The AI industry
uses a lot of energy - a single new data center can use as much
electricity as hundreds and thousands of homes. Exowatt has developed
modules roughly the size of shipping containers that hold solar lenses
that convert energy from the sun into heat. The company hopes to
eventually offer electricity as cheap as 1 cent per kilowatt-hour
without subsidies.
