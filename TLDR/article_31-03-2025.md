 ELON MUSK SAYS XAI HAS ACQUIRED X IN DEAL THAT VALUES SOCIAL MEDIA
SITE AT $33 BILLION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 xAI has merged with X in an all-stock transaction that valued the
artificial intelligence company at $80 billion and the social media
company at $33 billion. As both companies are privately held and
controlled by Elon Musk, the transaction was likely a stock swap, with
X investors getting paid out in xAI shares. The companies have several
mutual investors. X and xAI were already intertwined, with xAI's Grok
chatbot available to X users. 

 THE SECRETS AND MISDIRECTION BEHIND SAM ALTMAN'S FIRING FROM OPENAI
(15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI was set up to be a different kind of tech company from the
start - one governed by a nonprofit board with a duty not to the
shareholders, but to humanity. While Sam Altman's surprise firing was
an explosive headline around the world, OpenAI's board had no answers
for why he was fired beyond that he had not been consistently candid
with the board. Altman was quickly reinstated after it was clear that
the only way to keep the company from imploding was to bring him back.
This article tells the inside story in detail.

 FIRST THERAPY CHATBOT TRIAL YIELDS MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Dartmouth researchers have published the results of the first-ever
clinical trial of a generative AI-powered therapy chatbot. The
software resulted in significant improvement in participants' symptoms
- people in the study reported they could trust and communicate with
the system to a degree that is comparable to working with a mental
health professional. The study showed that AI has the potential to
provide real-time support for the many people who lack regular or
immediate access to a mental health professional. While there is no
replacement for in-person care, there are nowhere near enough
providers available - generative AI could help the huge number of
people outside of the in-person care system. 

 FIRST HORMONE-FREE MALE BIRTH CONTROL PILL CLEARS ANOTHER MILESTONE
(3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Researchers from the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy have
laid the groundwork for the first hormone-free male birth control pill
to enter clinical trials. YCT-529 is a hormone-free and orally
administered male contraceptive that works by stopping the production
of sperm. It appears to have no side effects (apart from infertility)
in mice and non-human primates - both groups regained fertility after
stopping the drug. The drug is currently undergoing safety and
efficacy testing.

 🚀 FROM MANUAL MOBILE REGRESSIONS TO 5X FASTER RELEASES (SPONSOR)
[12] 

 Manual regression testing shouldn't take a full week — but for most
mobile teams, it does.

QA cycles drag on for days. Triage and rework add even more delay,
resulting in slow, inconsistent mobile releases.

QA Wolf's [13] AI-native service delivers 80% automated test coverage
in weeks [14], with tests running on REAL IOS DEVICES AND ANDROID
SIMULATORS—all in 100% PARALLEL with zero flakes.

No more bottlenecks—just fast, reliable mobile app releases.

 GEMINI 2.5 IS THE NEW SOTA (20 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 While Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is not the best model for
everything, it is the model you want for reasoning and raw
intelligence. It can solve practical problems, it's fast, and it's not
$200 a month. The model's release shows that Google can offer high-end
large models, as well as the small models with large context windows
that it has so far been releasing. 

 MCP - IT'S HOT, BUT WILL IT WIN? (18 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new open source software layer that
can connect large language models to domain specific software. A broad
set of companies have announced support for MCP. Middleware never
quite lives up to its promises in practice. Over time, the negatives
of either being easily replaced or having user experience and feature
innovations ignored end up making the commitment to middleware look
like a poor investment.

 THE GEN X CAREER MELTDOWN (18 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Those who entered media or image-making in the 90s are probably now
doing something else for work because those industries have shrunk or
transformed radically, shutting out those whose skills were once in
high demand. People who once imagined they would be able to have a
solid career while flexing their creative muscles have seen their work
dry up over the past few decades as digital technology began seeping
into their lives. Many in Generation X now find themselves shut out
economically and culturally from their chosen fields. The shedding of
jobs and upending of longstanding business models has come at a bad
time, with the cost of living skyrocketing. 

 EMMETT SHEAR IS BACK WITH A NEW COMPANY AND A LOT OF ALIGNMENT (11
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Emmett Shear, Adam Goldstein, and David Bloomin have a new 10-person
start-up called Softmax. Softmax is part research lab and part
aspiring money maker. It aims to figure out how to fuse the goals of
humans and AI in a novel way. It is unknown yet what form the
technology Softmax hopes to develop will take in terms of an actual
product. The startup has raised an undisclosed amount from Andreessen
Horowitz, Lionheart Ventures, and Plural.
