 WITH VIDS, GOOGLE THINKS IT HAS THE NEXT BIG PRODUCTIVITY TOOL FOR
WORK (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google's new Vids app can create collaborative shareable videos for
things people do at work. The app makes making videos as easy as
making slides - no video production is required. Users line up assets
inside the app and edit it all into a finished video. They can choose
to do all of this themselves or ask Google's Gemini AI to build
storyboards, write scripts, read the scripts aloud using
text-to-speech, and create images to use in the video. People with
access to the video can add comments, leave notes, and make edits.
Vids will launch in public beta this summer. 

 INTEL‚ÄôS GAUDI 3 GOES AFTER NVIDIA (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Intel gave the first architectural details of its Gaudi 3
third-generation AI processor at Vision 2024 this week in Phoenix,
Arizona. Gaudi 3 is made up of two identical silicon dies, each with a
central region of 48 megabytes of cache memory, joined by a
high-bandwidth connection, surrounded by four engines for matrix
multiplication and 32 programmable units called tensor processor
cores. It produces double the AI compute of Gaudi 2 using 8-bit
floating-point infrastructure. It also provides a fourfold boost for
computations using the BFloat 16 number format.

answer a wider range of questions compared to its predecessor,

READ) [7] 

 Starfish, a neural interface company co-founded by Gabe Newell,
recently updated its website, indicating that its team is working hard
on its brain-computer solutions. The company is developing minimally
invasive one-dimensional implants for neuromodulation and neural
recording. Newell's interest in the field goes back to at least 2021,
when he brought up the idea of using brain-computer interfaces for
gaming. Valve has previously worked to create open source software to
allow developers to understand signals coming from people's brains.

applications. It can perform batch and streaming computation, scalable
backfills, low-latency serving, and more. Chronon can utilize all of
the data within an organization.
