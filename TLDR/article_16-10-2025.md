 ❌ 💾 CUT KAFKA COSTS BY UP TO 80% (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your Kafka cluster is costing you - and often more than you think.
Teams pay big-data prices for small-data streams, and burn engineering
hours managing stateful brokers.

Aiven Inkless (KIP-1150) [4] redefines Kafka with a diskless
architecture. Data is written directly to object storage (S3), and any
broker can handle any partition.

No local disks, no replication tax - and it all runs directly in your
VPC.

>> Slash your total cost of ownership by up to 80%

>> Keep running open-source Kafka

>> Reduce on-call toil

 NEW APPLE M5 IS THE CENTERPIECE OF AN UPDATED 14-INCH MACBOOK PRO (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's new 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro are
the first devices to get the new M5 processor. The M5 features four
high-performance CPU cores, six high-efficiency CPU cores, 10 GPU
cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine. Its biggest upgrade is a leap in
memory bandwidth that helps contribute to a 30% increase in GPU
performance and a 45% increase in ray-traced GPU performance relative
to the M4. The GPU includes a Neural Accelerator in each core that
improves the performance of GPU-based AI workloads by up to 400%. 

 GOOGLE'S AI CRACKS A NEW CANCER CODE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's latest biological AI system has generated and experimentally
confirmed a new hypothesis for cancer treatment. It could lead to a
promising new pathway for developing therapies to fight cancer.
Cell2Sentence-Scale 27B (C2S-Scale) is a 27-billion-parameter
foundation model for single-cell analysis built on Google's Gemma
family of models. The discovery shows that scaling up biological AI
models can result in them producing entirely new hypotheses.

 INSIDE THE COLORADO FACTORY WHERE ATMOSZERO IS ELECTRIFYING STEAM (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AtmosZero is building novel steam-producing heat pumps to replace the
gas-burning boilers that factories rely on. Its Boiler 2.0 machine can
be installed in a day in a process that is as simple as replacing an
old gas boiler. While it isn't as efficient as other heat pumps, it is
easier and cheaper to install, making it an attractive choice for
factories that don't want to disrupt operations. AtmosZero aims to
crank out 120 to 240 heat pumps per year by 2030. 

 SPACEX OFFERS NEW LOOK AT V3 STARLINK SATELLITE FOR GIGABIT SPEEDS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Starlink V3 is significantly longer and larger than its predecessors.
It uses a pair of longer solar arrays, and the central satellite bus
is also bigger. The improvements will enable the satellites to deliver
gigabit internet speeds. The larger size explains why SpaceX needs to
use Starship to deploy V3 satellites rather than on a Falcon 9. Each
V3 could weigh up to 2,000 kilograms.

 ONE MAJOR REASON AI ADOPTION STALLS? TRAINING. (SPONSOR) [9]

skills. This AI Training Checklist [9] from You.com [9] pinpoints
common pitfalls and guides you to build a capable, confident team that
can make the most out of your AI investment. Set your AI initiatives
on the right track: get the checklist. [9] 

 ANNOUNCING VITE+ (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vite+ is a unified toolchain for JavaScript. It works as a drop-in
upgrade to Vite with additional features. Tooling complexity and
performance have become real bottlenecks. Vite+ enables teams to focus
on shipping products instead of wasting time evaluating, configuring,
and debugging their tool stacks. 

 DESIGNING APIS FOR VIBE CODING (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vibe coders discover APIs by asking their LLMs to solve a problem.
This means apps looking to increase their vibe-ability will need to
make it easier for LLMs to discover and correctly use their APIs. Flat
and verbose beats concise, and conformity beats originality. This
could mean there will be fewer innovative API designs in the future
and that adoption might become tougher for newer programming
languages.

 TITLE ARBITRAGE AS STATUS ENGINEERING (16 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Titles are an imperfect signal of how one contributes to an
organization. Title arbitrage shifts the relative status of certain
positions and changes what people want to work on. Title deflation
abandons leveling schemes in favor of flatter hierarchies. Some title
refactors are simple name changes, while others are signals that a
company is taking an opinionated view of the world. Title arbitrage
and deflation are attempts to rewrite the status hierarchy and reshape
culture from the top down. 

 SPOTIFY & NETFLIX GUN FOR YOUTUBE'S EYEBALLS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Spotify has partnered with Netflix on video podcasts to compete with
YouTube. Netflix will require videos not to be posted to YouTube in
full as part of the deal, so only clips for promotional purposes will
be allowed. Netflix can't hope to scale in the way YouTube has without
user-generated content. This Spotify deal gives Netflix more content.
