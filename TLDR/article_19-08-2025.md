 HUMANS + AGENTIC AI. AGENTIC TRANSFORMATION YOU CAN TRUST. (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Agentic transformation is redefining work with autonomous AI agents
[4] that act with memory, context, and adaptability. But without
trust, orchestration, and human oversight, these systems risk
compliance gaps, runaway costs, and decisions you can't explain.

Join our upcoming webinar this Thursday, August 21st [4], to see how
Orkes Conductor embeds humans-in-the-loop for contract reviews,
compliance checkpoints, and high-stakes approvals. Discover Slack and
dashboard integrations for control and visibility, plus guardrails
like token limits, fallback orchestration, and budget tracking.
Includes a live demo. Times: 11 am CT & 6 pm CT. [4]

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE ATHLETES AT CHINA'S ROBOT GAMES FELL DOWN A LOT (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The Humanoid Robot Games was a three-day event held in Beijing that
featured more than 280 teams from universities and private companies
in 16 countries. The games included soccer matches, sprints,
kickboxing matches, and many other sports. China is trying to make
rapid advancements in robotics, and the games were a test of
cutting-edge advancements in robotics technology. They revealed
limitations, but also possibilities - despite some falls, significant
progress is being made in robot locomotion and balance. 

 THE WEIGHT OF A CELL (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 We know that a single yeast cell weighs about 100 picograms and a
single E. coli bacterium weighs about one picogram. While we now have
devices that can measure individual cells with femtogram precision,
scientists decades ago had to make do with whatever was already in the
lab. The weight of an individual yeast cell was first measured with
little more than a microscope, sugar water, and a camera. Measuring E.
coli required a completely different strategy. This post looks at
these early experiments to show how phenomena that seem difficult to
measure can be overcome through mathematics and first principles
thinking.

 THE BILLION-DOLLAR GAME BUILT IN A DORM ROOM (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Minh Le created Counter-Strike from his dorm room at Simon Fraser
University, a public research school just outside Vancouver, British
Columbia. The game, officially released in the fall of 2000 by Valve
Corporation, spawned half a dozen sequels and an esports vertical that
continues to generate billions from the sales of cosmetic weapon
skins. It has influenced decades of shooters and is arguably one of
the most important video games ever made. Counter-Strike's influence
is vast nearly 25 years later - even Call of Duty has offered a bomb
defusal mode lifted straight out of Counter-Strike. 

 JUST PEOPLE IN A ROOM (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Group projects suck, but they give students opportunities to run into
human problems in a safer environment. We are all just people with our
own biases, blinded to our own faults. Growing up means learning to
question ourselves while still trusting ourselves. By reflecting on
ourselves, little by little, we become better people.
