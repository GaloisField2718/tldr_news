 A LITHIUM BOOM IS COMING. GM-BACKED ENERGYX STANDS TO GAIN ‚Äî AND
YOU CAN BECOME A SHAREHOLDER TODAY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Lithium is essential for the batteries used in EVs. With every
automaker transitioning their fleet to fully electric, demand is
expected to increase 20x by 2040 [4], far outstripping current supply.

‚ö° EnergyX [4] has developed patented tech [4] that can extract 300%
more lithium than current methods. The company has opened its
investment round to the public [4] but only for a limited time ‚Äî
here's what you need to know:

 	* $89M+ invested to date, including General Motors leading a $50
million round [4]
 	* $5M grant from the U.S. Department of Energy
 	* Strategic agreements in place with top lithium producers
 	* Nearly 100 patents across 19 patent families

Don't miss your chance to invest in the lithium gold rush [4] before
the boom.

 OPENAI TRAINING ITS NEXT MAJOR AI MODEL, FORMS NEW SAFETY COMMITTEE
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has announced the formation of a new Safety and Security
Committee to oversee risk management for its projects and operations.
The company recently began training its next frontier model. The new
Safety and Security Committee will be responsible for making
recommendations about AI safety to the full company board of
directors. It will be responsible for processes and safeguards related
to alignment research, protecting children, upholding election
integrity, assessing societal impacts, and implementing security
measures. 

 AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE SHARED THOUSANDS OF LEAKED GOOGLE SEARCH API
DOCUMENTS WITH ME; EVERYONE IN SEO SHOULD SEE THEM (32 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 API documentation from Google Search was recently leaked. The
2,500-page document contained 14,014 attributes that appear to come
from Google's internal Content API Warehouse. While it doesn't show
things like the weight of particular elements in the search ranking
algorithm or prove which elements are used in the ranking systems, it
shows incredible details about the data Google collects. This article
looks at the leak and extracts some of the most interesting details,
for example, how Google utilized cookie history, logged-in Chrome
data, and pattern detection to fight manual and automated click spam.

 NEURALINK RIVAL SETS BRAIN-CHIP RECORD WITH 4,096 ELECTRODES ON HUMAN
BRAIN (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Precision Neuroscience claims to have set a new record for the number
of neuron-tapping electrodes placed on a living human's brain at
4,096. The high density of electrodes allowed neuroscientists to map
the activity of neurons at an unprecedented resolution during a
surgery to remove a benign brain tumor. Precision's device sits on top
of the brain and does not penetrate the brain at all. It consists of a
film that contains 1,024 electrodes embedded in a lattice pattern. The
device is modular, allowing for multiple films to be used at once -
four devices were used during the surgery. 

 WILL SCALING SOLVE ROBOTICS? (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Over 900 people attended last year's Conference on Robot Learning,
which featured 11 workshops and almost 200 accepted papers. One of the
largest debates at the event was whether training a large neural
network on a very large data set was a feasible way to solve robotics.
This post presents the different sides of the argument to deepen
people's understanding of the debate. Scaling has worked for other
similar fields. However, it is impractical as there isn't much
robotics data available and there's no clear way to get it. Even if
scaling works as well as in other fields, it likely still won't solve
robotics.

 DOING IS NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED, LEARNING IS LOG-NORMAL (3 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 A process taking two, three, or five times as long as estimated is
much more common when learning is involved. It is almost never the
case in software development that you know all or even most of the
technical hurdles that you will face in the process of development.
This throws everything we know about traditional project management
into disarray. Knowing your tooling and having enough experience can
help you provide better estimates. 

 YOUR API SHOULDN'T REDIRECT HTTP TO HTTPS (19 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The common practice of redirecting API calls from HTTP to HTTPS
should be reconsidered. Many programmatic API clients don't keep
browser-like state of things like HSTS headers they have seen. The
usability-security tradeoff argument doesn't apply as APIs are mostly
consumed by other software. HTTP interfaces should be disabled
entirely or return clear error responses for unencrypted requests. API
credentials sent over unencrypted connections should be considered
compromised and revoked.

 EX-OPENAI BOARD MEMBER REVEALS WHAT LED TO SAM ALTMAN'S BRIEF OUSTING
(3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Former OpenAI board member Helen Toner revealed new details about
what led to CEO Sam Altman's ousting in November in a recent
interview. The board had apparently learned about ChatGPT's release on
Twitter. Toner says that Altman had lied to the board multiple times.
Altman was reportedly withholding information and misrepresenting
things that were happening in the company for years. His lies made it
difficult for the board to make decisions, leading them to think that
he wasn't the right person to lead the company to AGI. 

 ASK HN: WHAT WOULD YOU SPEND YOUR TIME WORKING ON IF YOU DIDN'T NEED
MONEY? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [13] 

 This Hacker News thread discusses what developers would choose to do
for their ideal job. The answers range from large, world-benefiting
schemes to personal projects and just doing nothing. Some of the
answers are from people who have retired or are about to retire.
