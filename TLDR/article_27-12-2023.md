 NO LAST-MINUTE REPRIEVE, US BAN ON SOME APPLE WATCH SALES NOW IN
EFFECT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is banned from selling the Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 in
the US. The Biden administration had 60 days to grant a reprieve from
the ban, but it refused to do so. Apple strongly disagrees with the
decision and it is taking all measures to return the devices to
customers as soon as possible, including filing an appeal against the
ruling from the US International Trade Commission. The company had
preemptively halted sales of the devices from its website on December
21 and in physical stores from December 24. 

 MICROSOFT COPILOT IS NOW AVAILABLE AS A CHATGPT-LIKE APP ON ANDROID
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft has launched a dedicated Copilot app for Android. It offers
access to Copilot without the need for the Bing mobile app. Copilot
has access to OpenAI's latest GPT-4 model and image generation through
DALL-E 3. There's no indication yet of an iOS version, but it is
likely to be right around the corner.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 CAN FLOW BATTERIES FINALLY BEAT LITHIUM? (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Flow batteries use two chemical solutions containing ions that react
to push electrons through a circuit. They beat lithium batteries in
performance and safety and they scale up more easily. Conventional
flow battery packs have very low energy density and are bulky, making
them impractical. A new type of energy-dense fluid has been created
that has enabled new types of flow batteries that appear to beat
lithium-ion batteries for use in EVs and larger systems.
Nanoelectrofuel is reusable, fireproof, and easy to clean in case of a
spill, making it an attractive alternative to lithium or petrol. 

 MODERNA‚ÄôS MRNA CANCER VACCINE WORKS EVEN BETTER THAN THOUGHT (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Moderna and Merck are developing an mRNA-based cancer vaccine for
people who have had high-risk melanomas removed. It works by
instructing the body to make proteins found only on cancer cells to
prepare the immune system to quickly identify and attack any new
cancer cells bearing them, preventing recurrence. An ongoing phase 2b
study found that people who received treatment with the therapy along
with an FDA-approved cancer treatment were 49% less likely to
experience recurrence or death a median of three years after treatment
compared to people who only received the FDA-approved cancer
treatment. The vaccine could be launched under accelerated approval in
some countries by 2025.

 WEDGES (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Wedges is a React UI library built with the Wedges Design System,
Radix primitives, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a range of pre-built,
customizable components that are easy to use and integrate into React
projects. Wedges has full TypeScript support. 

 REFORMING UNIX (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Core abstractions can last a long time. Reforming is better than
replacing as changing things is risky and there is a lot of code that
can't be replaced all at once. This article presents concrete new
interfaces that could be part of a Unix reform project. It covers null
namespaces, spawning processes, file systems, networking, and more.

 TECH JOB IS A POWER LAW JOB (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 There was never any job security in startups - the last few years
were a mirage. No one should expect to make these kinds of salaries
without any risk or sacrifice. Changes in supply and demand in the job
market don't reflect changes in an individual's value or skill.
There's always the choice to take a safer and easier route. 

 U.S. AND CHINA RACE TO SHIELD SECRETS FROM QUANTUM COMPUTERS (20
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Everyone's secrets are at risk of exposure - quantum computers may
make current encryption methods useless as soon as 2025. A global
effort is currently underway to gather data to decrypt with quantum
machines when it becomes possible. There is also a scramble to protect
critical data with post-quantum cryptography. Besides cracking codes,
quantum computing also promises to deliver breakthroughs in science,
armaments, and industry.

 THE 3 BUDGETS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Software engineering salaries come from one of 3 budgets:
sales/marketing, research and development, and maintenance. 

 JAPAN TO CRACK DOWN ON APPLE AND GOOGLE APP STORE MONOPOLIES (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Japan is preparing regulations that would require tech giants to
allow outside app stores and payments on their mobile operating
systems. 

 HOW THERMAL MANAGEMENT IS CHANGING IN THE AGE OF THE KILOWATT CHIP (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Systems builders are responding to more power-dense parts by using
more liquid cooling. 

 JEFF BEZOS ON GENERATIVE AI: ‚ÄúTHEY‚ÄôRE NOT INVENTIONS. THEY‚ÄôRE
DISCOVERIES.‚Äù (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Generative AI models aren't engineered objects - we're constantly
finding out new things about them. 

 RESEARCH: THE GROWING INEQUALITY OF WHO GETS TO WORK FROM HOME (5
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Remote work is more common for higher-paid roles, roles that require
more experience, full-time work, and roles that require more
education. 

 WILL SCALING WORK? (23 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 If scaling is successful in getting better and more general
performance from large language models, then we should expect powerful
AIs before 2040, but if it doesn't, then the path to artificial
general intelligence seems much longer and more intractable.
