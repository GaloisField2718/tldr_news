 MARK ZUCKERBERG‚ÄôS NEW GOAL IS CREATING ARTIFICIAL GENERAL
INTELLIGENCE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mark Zuckerberg has announced plans to achieve artificial general
intelligence (AGI). While he doesn't have a timeline for when AGI will
be reached or an exact definition for it, he has moved Meta's AI
research group FAIR to the same part of the company building
generative AI products across its apps. The move aims to allow Meta's
AI breakthroughs to more directly reach its users. Meta plans to own
more than 340,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by the end of the year. 

 THE NEXT IOS UPDATE WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO BREAK INTO YOUR IPHONE (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple's newest security feature, Stolen Device Protection, makes it
far harder for thieves to hijack Apple IDs and any financial
information stored on the device. It will require users to use Face ID
or Touch ID and certain changes may take up to an hour to take effect.
The feature addresses a key vulnerability where thieves can lock
victims out of their Apple IDs by resetting the password using their
passcodes. Stolen Device Protection will be included in the iOS 17.3
release expected next week.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 FIGURE'S HUMANOID ROBOTS ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE WORKFORCE AT BMW (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Figure is sending its general-purpose humanoid robots to start
real-world work at BMW's manufacturing plant in South Carolina. The
deal may be one of the first-ever commercial deals involving humanoid
robots. While the two companies have yet to announce exactly what
Figure's robots will be doing on the factory floor, training has
already begun in the company's labs for the first tasks. The
partnership is milestone-based, so Figure will have to prove its
robots can do useful work before it scales its operations. 

 FLYING KITES DELIVER CONTAINER-SIZE POWER GENERATION (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Airborne wind energy is a new field that uses kites instead of
turbines to generate energy from wind. Kites are nimbler than turbines
and can deliver a more constant energy supply. Netherlands-based
company Kitepower has developed a system called Hawk that flies out in
'pumping' cycles - it flies out while pulling at a tether, generating
electricity on the ground, and when the tether reaches its maximum
length, the ground station winches the kite back in, using only a
fraction of the energy it produced. The system fits into a standard
shipping container and assembly at a new site takes less than 24
hours.

 WHISPERSPEECH (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 WhisperSpeech is a text-to-speech system built by inverting Whisper.
The models are currently only trained on the English LibreLight
dataset, but future releases will target multiple languages. Samples
of synthesized voices are available in the repository. 

 WHAT'S NEW WITH ML IN PRODUCTION (27 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Most machine learning in production is still not related to large
language models or generative AI, which make up less than 10% of the
market at most. At their core, machine learning models are algorithms
that perform compression on a corpus of data. A lot has changed in
leading-edge machine learning applications over the past year as the
industry has moved from smaller, business-specific models that perform
specific tasks to very large generalist models that complete text. The
pendulum is again shifting to smaller models that people are starting
to fine-tune and run on their own. The industry still focuses on
compression, but it is changing where and how much it is controlled.

 COMING TO GRIPS WITH APPLE‚ÄôS SEEMINGLY UNSHAKABLE SENSE OF
ENTITLEMENT TO ITS COMMISSIONS FROM THIRD-PARTY IOS APPS (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Apple has introduced a new tax on web purchases that prevents
developers from offering digital items more cheaply on the web. Epic
will contest this plan in District Court. Apple is demanding
commission from web sales that occur within 7 days of a user tapping
through to the web from its new External Purchase Links entitlement in
an app - services that already sell over the web can continue to do so
in exactly the same way. Some critics say Apple shouldn't and legally
can't comply with its anti-steering injunction this way, but it looks
like the company isn't doing anything contrary to the law. 

 SAM ALTMAN SAYS AI USING TOO MUCH ENERGY, WILL REQUIRE BREAKTHROUGH
ENERGY SOURCE (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 It's no secret that AI models require astronomical amounts of
electricity to run. Experts estimate that the industry could soon use
as much electricity as an entire country. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is
looking for cheaper energy alternatives. Future models will require
even more power to the degree that they'll need a whole new power
source. Altman has already invested around $375 million in a nuclear
fusion company.

 HOW TO DESIGN AN ISA (32 MINUTE READ) [21]

microarchitecture - the rise of RISC-V as an open base for custom
