 PERPLEXITY MAKES LONGSHOT $34.5 BILLION OFFER FOR CHROME (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 AI startup Perplexity has made an offer to purchase Google's Chrome
browser for $34.5 billion. The offer is significantly more than
Perplexity's own valuation at $18 billion and far below some estimates
of Chrome's enterprise value. A US District Judge is currently
weighing whether to force Google to sell the browser. Perplexity's
offer could be an attempt to signal to the judge that there is an
interested buyer should he force a sale. 

 SAM ALTMAN, OPENAI WILL REPORTEDLY BACK A STARTUP THAT TAKES ON
MUSK'S NEURALINK (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sam Altman is in the process of co-funding a new brain-computer
interface startup called Merge Labs. He is raising funds for it using
capital possibly coming largely from OpenAI's ventures team. Merge
Labs is expected to be valued at $850 million - OpenAI has not yet
committed to the deal, so terms could change. The startup will compete
with Elon Musk's Neuralink, which currently has a device in trials for
people who suffer from severe paralysis.

 THE EXPANDING WORLD OF GENETIC TESTING FOR YOUR EMBRYOS (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is testing performed on embryos
before implantation for the purposes of gathering genetic information
to guide embryo selection during IVF. It is considered a low-risk
procedure when performed by experienced professionals. This article
looks at what can and can't be learned from the genetic testing of
embryos and the different types of testing available today. PGT
results should only be seen as screening and not a perfect diagnosis.
While it is powerful, it is only useful if it is understood and
applied properly.

 TECH DEBT? I DON'T BELIEVE IT EXISTS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 One way to approach tech debt is to treat it like it doesn't exist
and instead focus on things that are causing problems now, things that
will be causing problems soon, and things that are not causing
problems. Sometimes people want to schedule tech debt in - this is an
anti-pattern that indicates you don't actually know what your problems
are, where you want to go, and why you want to go there. Getting a
handle on tech debt is about working on the right problems, at the
right time, for the right reasons. 

 NO AGI IN SIGHT: WHAT THIS MEANS FOR LLMS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 There's a widening gap between AI hype and reality. Large language
models have hit a plateau despite industry claims of imminent
superintelligence. Releases have been underwhelming despite bold
predictions and massive investments. The industry needs to make
systems actually useful for the industry to have a future.

 OPENAI BURNS THE BOATS (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic was dominating the AI coding space and had a consistently
better model than OpenAI for almost two years. OpenAI's response was
to set the entire business model on fire and move to a different
arena. By releasing GPT-5, a model with the same performance
benchmarks as Claude on coding, at a cost of $10 per million tokens,
every application layer company that was previously dependent on
Anthropic's price point switched overnight. The move signals OpenAI's
willingness to prevent the AI coding market from existing.
