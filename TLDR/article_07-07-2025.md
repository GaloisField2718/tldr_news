 TIKTOK'S ‚ÄòBAN' PROBLEM COULD END SOON WITH A NEW APP AND A SALE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Trump administration says it's close to an agreement for a TikTok
sale that satisfies the law's requirements, but it involves a new,
separate version of the app. The deal still needs approval from the
Chinese government. TikTok staff are reportedly working on a new
version of the app for release in app stores on September 5. Under the
current timeline, the original TikTok app will leave app stores as the
new one launches, and the old one will stop working entirely in March
2026. 

 OPENAI EXPERIMENTS WITH NEW "STUDY TOGETHER" TOOL ON CHATGPT (1
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 'Study together' is a new tool in ChatGPT that guides users through
the study process step-by-step. It creates a more interactive, guided
study environment by posing more questions and breaking down topics,
helping users actively learn rather than just receive explanations. It
checks answers and adapts by offering follow-ups or clarifying
explanations as needed. There is currently no official timeline for
the rollout of the feature - a growing number of users are reporting
access, indicating a limited A/B test or pre-release trial.

 TESLA LAUNCHES OASIS SUPERCHARGER WITH SOLAR FARM AND OFF-GRID
BATTERIES (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Tesla's Oasis Supercharger, an EV charging station with a solar farm
and off-grid batteries, is now open in Lost Hills, California. The
project consists of 168 chargers, half of which are currently
operational. It is equipped with 11 MW of ground-mounted solar panels
and canopies. Spanning 30 acres of land, it has 10 Tesla Megapacks
with a total energy storage capacity of 39 MWh. The charging station
can be operated off-grid. The rest of the stalls and a lounge will be
open later this year. 

 UK FIRM ACHIEVES TRITIUM BREAKTHROUGH, COULD BOOST NUCLEAR FUSION
FUEL SUPPLY (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 UK-based private commercial fusion company Astral Systems claims to
be the first firm to successfully breed tritium, a vital fusion fuel,
using a fusion reactor. The achievement addresses a significant hurdle
in the development of fusion energy. It clearly demonstrates a
potential path to scalable tritium production, which could unlock a
wide range of applications and capabilities. The ability to generate
tritium within the reactor is crucial - a sustainable fusion energy
system needs to produce more fuel than it consumes.

 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING WITH LLMS IN 2025: REALITY CHECK (31 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Executives at AI infrastructure companies have made bold claims about
the technology, but developers often find these claims to fall
spectacularly flat. This article looks at how AI is used within the
tech industry to see why founders/CEOs are more bullish than devs
about AI tools, how widespread usage is among developers, how much
time AI tools really save, and more. Many seasoned software engineers
were skeptical about AI tools until very recently - now, most are
surprisingly enthusiastic and see these tools as a change that will
reshape software development. 

 HOW TO BECOME PASSIONATE ABOUT DELIVERING SHAREHOLDER VALUE (8 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Many engineers believe their jobs are to write good code, thinking
that delivering shareholder value is the company's business, not
theirs. Delivering shareholder value means making the company stock
price go up and stay up. Shareholder value is part of the software
design process - engineers should be connected to the financial goals
of the company. Not all engineers are working in situations that can
affect shareholder value, but those who work in more functional
environments have a real opportunity to shape the financial situation
of their companies, for good or ill.

 THE CODER ‚ÄòVILLAGE' AT THE HEART OF CHINA'S A.I. FRENZY (9 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Liangzhu, a suburb in the southern Chinese city of Hangzhou, is a hot
spot for entrepreneurs and tech talent. Lured by the low rents and
proximity to tech companies like Alibaba and DeepSeek, people flock to
the city to explore their own possibilities. The provincial and local
governments started offering subsidies and tax breaks to new companies
in the region a decade ago, which helped to incubate hundreds of
startups. The region has already birthed tech powerhouses like
Alibaba, DeepSeek, NetEase, and Hikvision. 

 THE COMPANIES BETTING THEY CAN PROFIT FROM GOOGLE SEARCH'S DEMISE (6
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 At least a dozen new startups are betting on the rapid demise of
Google search and pouring millions of dollars into AI tools. These
companies are helping businesses understand how AI chatbots gather
information and how to steer them towards brands so that they appear
in AI searches. The customer interest is a sign of how AI is
transforming search and how companies are trying to get ahead of the
changes.
