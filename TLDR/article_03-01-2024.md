 SPACEX STARLINK TO LAUNCH FIRST DIRECT-TO-CELL INTERNET SATELLITES (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SpaceX has launched its first batch of six Starlink satellites
designed to enable direct-to-cell internet service from space. The
satellites will provide global access to texting, calling, and
browsing anywhere in the world without special hardware or firmware.
They have a modem that acts as a cellphone tower in space, eliminating
dead zones with network integration. Partner providers will include
T-Mobile in the US, Rogers in Canada, and Optus in Australia. 

 FOLDABLES HELP CHIP AWAY AT APPLE'S PREMIUM SMARTPHONE LEAD IN 2023
(1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Foldables emerged as a differentiator in the premium smartphone
market in 2023. Apple ended the year with a 71% share of the premium
smartphone market due to competition from Huawei and Samsung. While
global smartphone sales have been down, the premium segment is set to
grow 6% year-on-year. Consumers are willing to spend more to get a
higher quality device that will last longer and promotions, sales, and
financing options make the devices accessible to a larger market.

 JUNO MAKES ITS FIRST ULTRA-CLOSE FLYBY OF THE VOLCANO-COVERED MOON IO
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NASA's Juno spacecraft flew within 930 miles of the surface of Io,
the fourth largest moon in the Solar System, on Saturday. Io is a
dense and dry moon that is extremely geologically active, making it an
object of great interest to astronomers and planetary scientists. The
data collected from the flyby will help scientists determine how Io's
volcanoes erupt and how its activity is connected to Jupiter's
magnetosphere. A link to a gallery of images from the flyby is
available in the article. 

 HUMANOID ROBOTS ARE GETTING TO WORK (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A handful of companies will be deploying their humanoid robots in
commercial pilot projects this year. This article looks at the current
state of humanoid robots and whether they're ready for work. Humanoid
robots are able to replace human workers doing robotic jobs, freeing
them to be able to work in other more valuable positions. The pilot
tests this year will determine whether their potential will translate
into a fundamental shift in how repetitive labor is done.

 LLMS AND PROGRAMMING IN THE FIRST DAYS OF 2024 (26 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Large language models (LLMs) are great for programming work, but
using them requires practice. Communicating poorly is a great
limitation. Many programmers communicate poorly despite being very
capable in their field. Asking LLMs the right questions is a
fundamental skill that can be improved with practice. 

 THE NIX THESIS (35 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This blog post extracts some of the insights from 'The Purely
Functional Software Deployment Model' by Eelco Dolstra into short-form
content to inspire others to read the full text. The book is an often
recommended resource for learning about Nix, a powerful and flexible
package manager for Linux and other Unix-like systems. It is still
remarkably relevant given its age. A significant portion of the book
is philosophical rather than technical.

 WHY WALL STREET MIGHT BE FALLING IN LOVE WITH BITCOIN (8 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Fees, delays, and existential risks of crypto exchanges have led most
of the investing public to remain on the sidelines with Bitcoin.
However, the widely expected approval of numerous bitcoin Exchange
Traded Funds (ETFs) in the coming days could change all that. ETFs are
one of the world's most popular ways to invest. An ETF would make
investing in bitcoin easy and relatively more safe. A bitcoin ETF
could, in theory, push the price of bitcoin even higher over the
coming weeks, months, and years. 

 2024 MAY BE A YEAR OF RECKONING FOR APPLE‚ÄôS $85 BILLION SERVICES
BUSINESS (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple is facing a series of regulatory decisions by US and EU
authorities that will determine its future. If Google loses its
antitrust trial, it could be forced to stop making regular payments to
Apple worth an estimated quarter of the annual revenues earned by
Apple's services arm. Apple and other tech giants are being forced to
change their app store policies to allow sideloading of apps. Both of
these changes will have large impacts on Apple's revenue.
