 6 FINTECH PREDICTIONS: WHY FRAUDSTERS ARE EXCITED ABOUT AI (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 The heaviest users of AI in fintech aren't fintechs. Bad actors are
the real early adopters - mass-generating fake IDs, deepfakes, and
large-scale social engineering.

According to Plaid's 2026 Fintech Predictions [4], this imbalance will
persist in the short term. What else is coming? Read the whitepaper
[4] where Plaid CEO Zach Perret, joined by Credit Product Lead
Michelle Young and CTO Will Robinson, share their takes on where
fintech is headed next. 

You'll discover why:

 	* Neobanks will launch via stablecoins instead of traditional banks
 	* Lenders will focus more on fraud than delinquency
 	* Conversational AI will become the default fintech UI
 	* And more

 ELON MUSK WANTS TO BUILD AN AI SATELLITE FACTORY ON THE MOON (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk has told employees at xAI that the company needs a factory
on the moon to build AI satellites. These satellites will be launched
into space using a massive catapult called a 'mass driver'. Musk plans
to build a self-sustaining city on the moon as a steppingstone to Mars
and beyond. SpaceX is preparing for an initial public offering that
could come as early as June. 

 MUSK'S XAI LOSES SECOND CO-FOUNDER IN TWO DAYS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Jimmy Ba and Tony Wu, two of xAI's co-founders, have left the
company. The departure comes as xAI faces regulatory probes in
multiple jurisdictions across Europe, Asia, and the US regarding the
company's Grok AI chatbot allowing the mass-creation and syndication
of non-consensual, explicit images. These images were based on photos
of real people, including children. xAI merged with SpaceX earlier
this month.

 THE ISOMORPHIC LABS DRUG DESIGN ENGINE UNLOCKS A NEW FRONTIER BEYOND
ALPHAFOLD (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Isomorphic Labs Drug Design Engine (IsoDDE) is a unified
computational drug-design system that progresses beyond AlphaFold 3 in
its predictive accuracy. It introduces new capabilities that bridge
the gap between structure prediction and real-world drug discovery.
IsoDDe can predict small molecule binding affinities with accuracies
that exceed gold-standard physics-based methods at a fraction of the
time and cost. It offers a scalable foundation for AI drug design and
represents a leap forward in accuracy and capability. 

 SPACEX'S NEXT-GEN SUPER HEAVY BOOSTER ACES FOUR DAYS OF
“CRYOPROOF” TESTING (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SpaceX's upgraded Super Heavy booster has completed cryogenic proof
testing for the first time. The successful test moves engineers closer
to launching the first test flight of an upgraded version of SpaceX's
mega-rocket, Starship V3. SpaceX launched Starship V2 five times last
year, but the first three test flights failed. SpaceX could be in
position to launch the first Starship V3 test flight before the end of
March.

 MINIONS: STRIPE'S ONE-SHOT, END-TO-END CODING AGENTS (9 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Minions are coding agents that are built to one-shot tasks. Stripe
merges over a thousand completely minion-generated pull requests each
week. A typical minion run starts in a Slack message and ends in a
pull request that passes CI and is ready for human review, with no
interaction in between. This post shows how Stripe's engineers use
minions and what they can do. 

 CHROME 146 INCLUDES AN EARLY PREVIEW OF WEBMCP (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 WebMCP lets agents query and execute services without browsing the
web like a user. The web standard exposes structured tools for AI
agents on existing websites to replace screen-scraping with robust,
high-performance page interaction and knowledge retrieval. WebMCP lets
agentic browsers know exactly how to interact with page features to
support a user's experience.

 HEURISTICS FOR LAB ROBOTICS, AND WHERE ITS FUTURE MAY GO (38 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 It's very possible that lab robotics, cloud labs, and the like will
not actually fundamentally alter the broader problems that drug
discovery faces. Automation is meant to be a throughput multiplier.
The technology will enable different experiments at a scale that would
be impossible without automation. It will become rational to start
doing the things that everyone already knows they should be doing but
can't currently justify. 

 AI IS GIVING YOU A PERSONALIZED INTERNET, BUT YOU HAVE NO SAY IN IT
(10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI is personalizing the internet for everyone with tailored ads,
bespoke advice, and unique product prices. There's typically no 'off'
switch for these tools, giving users less say in things. Opting out is
often complicated. The tech industry's strategy of forcing AI on users
is at odds with feedback from many users.
