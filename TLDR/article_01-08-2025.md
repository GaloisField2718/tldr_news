 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 COINBASE SAYS IT'S LAUNCHING TOKENIZED STOCKS, PREDICTIONS MARKETS
FOR U.S. USERS IN COMING MONTHS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Coinbase plans to expand its core trading app to include tokenized
real-world assets, stocks, derivatives, prediction markets, and
early-stage token sales. These new offers will roll out first to US
users in the next few months, followed by a gradual international
rollout based on jurisdictional approvals. The expansion puts the
exchange in even closer competition with Robinhood, Gemini, and
Kraken. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently introduced an
initiative to modernize securities rules and regulations to allow for
crypto-based trading activity. 

 FIGMA MORE THAN TRIPLES IN NYSE DEBUT AFTER SELLING SHARES AT $33 (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Figma's shares more than tripled in its New York Stock Exchange debut
yesterday. The company sold shares at $33 in its initial public
offering - FIG closed at $115.50. Figma ended the day with a market
cap of almost $68 billion. Adobe had agreed to acquire Figma for $20
billion in 2022, but the deal fell apart after UK regulators said it
would likely harm competition.

 MOON'S FIRST-EVER RADIO TELESCOPE READY FOR THE DARK SIDE (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment (LuSEE-Night) is a
radio telescope that will be deployed on the far side of the Moon. The
moon will act as a shield against the radio interference coming from
Earth. LuSEE-Night is scheduled to launch as part of Firefly
Aerospace's Blue Ghost 2 lunar lander mission late this year or early
next. It is designed to detect the signals that are key to unlocking
the secrets of the Cosmic Dark Ages, the period after the cosmic
microwave background formed 380,000 years after the Big Bang and
before the formation of the first stars and galaxies. 

 GOOGLE'S GEOTHERMAL EXPERIMENTS ARE ENGINEERING TEMPLATES FOR THE
ENERGY TRANSITION (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Data centers are under pressure to run denser, hotter, and longer,
and traditional air cooling is approaching its limit. Meeting demand
now requires rethinking the entire power-thermal integration stack.
Google is integrating geothermal systems directly into its
next-generation data centers. If successful, the systems could help
Google meet its power needs with near-constant carbon-free energy.

 ENGINEERING BUY-IN (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The best way to convince those around you to take on a project idea
is to individually talk about it with many relevant people before
finally pitching it to a decision-making group. Your odds of success
dramatically increase if you've talked to the decision-makers in
advance and have addressed their issues or incorporated their
additions. Leaders need to create buy-in from their teams to maintain
team morale. Getting everyone to buy in encourages autonomous
collaboration and helps iteration happen quickly, but it could also
lead to groupthink, exclude oppositional peers, and cause teams to
misrepresent reality. 

 OUR FIRST OUTAGE FROM LLM-WRITTEN CODE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sketch experienced a series of mini-outages on July 15. An LLM had
made a small but critical change during a refactor that was missed by
a human reviewer. When humans refactor code, they select the original
text, cut it, move it to the new file, paste it, and then make
intentional changes. LLMs write two patches, a deletion and an
insertion, leaving room for transcription errors. Sketch added
clipboard support to its agent environment to try to prevent further
issues in transcription.

 FIGMA: A RANDOM WALK IN PALO ALTO (2025) (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Figma just went public in one of the largest IPOs in Silicon Valley
history. This article tells the story of Figma and its founder, Dylan
Field. Field's journey was a true Silicon Valley story. It seems
likely that in the near future, more and more applications will be
built by designers using Figma. 

 RAMBLINGS (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Remote teams of two to 10 people could benefit from adding a personal
'ramblings' channel for each teammate. These channels let everyone
share what's on their mind without cluttering group channels. They can
be a great source for ideas, prototypes, or creative solutions to
long-standing problems. They're also a great way to keep the human
connection going within the company.
