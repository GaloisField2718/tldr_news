 APPLE'S NEW SHAKE-UP PROVES SIRI'S NOW BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY, HERE'S
WHY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Former Apple Vision Pro head Mike Rockwell is now in charge of Siri.
While Rockwell's experience doesn't make him a natural choice, it
shows that Apple has decided that Siri deserves attention from a
top-tier Apple leader. Rockwell has developed and launched major
hardware and software platforms for Apple. The new leadership
represents a big shift in how much the company is valuing and
prioritizing Siri.

 BOSTON DYNAMICS SHOWS OFF ANOTHER MAJOR LEAP IN HUMANOID MOBILITY (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Boston Dynamics has released a new video (available in the article)
that shows its Atlas robot running, cartwheeling, and breakdancing.
Atlas' walking now resembles walking rather than taking a bunch of
steps - its other movements are starting to look less forced too. The
current explosion in humanoid robotics is still at a very early stage,
but it is looking clearer than ever that humans and androids will soon
be interacting regularly in daily life. Chinese company Unitree has
also been doing incredible work with its lightweight G1 humanoid,
which has a starting price tag of $16,000. 

 INSIDE ‘ECCENTRIC' RIPPLE FOUNDER'S MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR SPACE
STATION PLAN (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Jed McCaleb, the serial entrepreneur who founded Mt. Gox and Ripple,
has a new company, Vast, that is on track to launch a commercial space
station into orbit by May 2026. Vast is building its spacecraft with
components developed by SpaceX. If it succeeds, it will be better
positioned to win a lucrative contract from NASA to replace the
International Space Station - if it fails, McCaleb could see $1
billion wiped from his net worth. Vast is competing with Axiom Space,
Voyager Space Holdings, Lockheed Martin, and Blue Origin to win the
NASA contract.

 ACCELERATING LARGE-SCALE TEST MIGRATION WITH LLMS (7 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Airbnb recently completed its first large-scale large language
model-driven code migration. It updated nearly 3,500 React component
test files from Enzyme to use React Testing Library instead. This was
estimated to take 1.5 years of engineering to do by hand, but Airbnb
managed to finish the entire migration in just six weeks using a
combination of frontier models and robust automation. This blog post
looks at the challenges the Airbnb team faced during the migration,
how large language models helped solve this particular type of
challenge, and how the team structured its tooling to run an AI-driven
migration at scale.

 PERPLEXITY'S CEO HAS AN AMBITIOUS PLAN TO TAKE ON GOOGLE (15 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Perplexity AI is ramping up its rivalry with Google on multiple
fronts. It has expanded its research options for businesses, created
tools to look up financial data, expanded a partnership with SoftBank
for its sales team to resell Perplexity's premium products, and made a
long-shot bid to merge with TikTok. Perplexity's CEO, Aravind
Srinivas, envisions a world where Perplexity serves as a central hub
for more sophisticated and affordable AI tools that can generally act
as a personal assistant for users. This article contains an interview
with Srinivas where he discusses how he's growing Perplexity's
enterprise business, why he's bullish on DeepSeek, and the thinking
behind his TikTok bid. 

 APPLE LOSES $1B A YEAR ON PRESTIGIOUS, MINIMALLY VIEWED APPLE TV+ (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Apple TV+ streaming service is losing more than $1 billion
annually. The service's subscriber count reached around 45 million in
2024. Apple TV+ typically spends over $5 billion annually on content,
but it cut its budget by about $500 million last year. It is
reportedly the only part of Apple's services business that is not
turning a profit. While its library boasts prestige, its viewership is
scant, hindering its ability to make money.
