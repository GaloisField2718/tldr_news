 BYTEDANCE INTERN FIRED FOR PLANTING MALICIOUS CODE IN AI MODELS (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 An intern at ByteDance maliciously interfered with the company's
model training tasks, sabotaging its AI models. They were fired for
committing serious disciplinary violations. None of the intern's
sabotage impacted ByteDance's commercial projects or online business
and none of the company's large models were affected. Rumors suggest
the intern's actions cost the company tens of millions of dollars in
losses, but ByteDance says those claims are exaggerated.

EssilorLuxottica have extended their partnership into the 2030s. The
companies plan to continue developing multi-generational smart eyewear
products.

 SOLAR POWER FROM SPACE? ACTUALLY, IT MIGHT HAPPEN IN A COUPLE OF
YEARS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The idea of harvesting solar power continuously from space, where
there are no nights, clouds, or atmosphere to interfere with the
collection of photons, and beaming it back down to Earth via
microwaves sounds simple, but implementing the technology is
difficult. Aetherflux, a small company with only about 10 employees,
plans to launch a satellite to test the idea and determine both the
safety and efficiency of collecting solar energy in space. If the demo
mission works, Aetherflux plans to develop a constellation of
satellites to deliver power to remote locations. 

 MATH IS STILL CATCHING UP TO THE MYSTERIOUS GENIUS OF SRINIVASA
RAMANUJAN (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Srinivasa Ramanujan, who died at the age of 32 in 1920, had a
mathematical gift that others did not. He came up with thousands of
elegant and surprising results, often without proof, saying that his
equations had been bestowed on him by gods. Mathematicians are still
trying to catch up to his work more than 100 years later. This article
takes a look at Ramanujan's life and work and how his insights
continue to appear again and again in the world of mathematics.

 HERE'S WHAT TURBOTAX'S BOSS DOESN'T WANT YOU TO HEAR (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 TurboTax's CEO Sasan Saeedi recently got into a somewhat
confrontational exchange during an interview where he was pressed
about parent company Intuit's efforts to prevent a simplification of
tax filing in the US. Intuit's Head of Communications requested the
segment be cut from the interview or otherwise heavily edited to make
it seem less confrontational. The company has been strongly opposed to
the IRS making its own software for free tax filing. It offers free
tax filing to some US citizens as a cover to continue a regime of
charging others for tax preparation.
