 SAM ALTMAN ON OPENAI'S PLAN TO WIN, AI PERSONALIZATION,
INFRASTRUCTURE MATH, AND THE INEVITABLE IPO (50 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sam Altman recently appeared on Big Technology Podcast to discuss
OpenAI's strategy to win, where the product lineup is going in the
coming year, how OpenAI's over $1 trillion in AI infrastructure
commitments make sense, and the company's future plans for AI devices
and AI cloud. The strategy to keep OpenAI ahead involves getting
people to use its products, keeping them there with the best models,
serving the use cases they want with reliable compute, then expanding
into areas like enterprise and hardware. The full conversation, along
with links to the audio, is available in the article. 

 TESLA WINS FINAL COURT FIGHT OVER ELON MUSK'S PAY PACKAGE (7 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Tesla won its fight over Elon Musk's record-breaking pay package
approved by shareholders in 2018. The Delaware Supreme Court said the
lower court's ruling would have deprived Musk of compensation for
several years of work, so he should get the full pay package. Musk's
2018 stock options have grown in value to $139 billion. It was
initially valued at more than $2.3 billion, already shattering
previous compensation records.

 US PLANS LARGEST NUCLEAR POWER PROGRAM SINCE THE 1970S (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The Trump administration launched a partnership in October to build
at least $80 billion worth of new, large-scale nuclear reactors. The
money will support the construction of a type of pressurized water
reactor developed by Westinghouse that can generate about 1,110
megawatts of electric power. The partnership includes profit-sharing
mechanisms that will give the US government some of the upside if the
initiative succeeds. 

 EX-ASML WORKERS REVERSE-ENGINEERED STATE OF THE ART CHIPMAKING

 China reportedly has a prototype EUV chipmaking machine. While it has
not yet produced a working chip, it is apparently creating EUV light.
The machine is expected to produce its first chip in 2028. The Dutch
company ASML had previously been the sole producer of EUV machines.

 THE BIG-O COMPLEXITY OF VIBE CODERS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Efficiency becoming a metric will create pressure and cause
exploration to look wasteful. High-token sessions will start to look
sloppy. Over time, AI will turn into another optimization target, and
eventually into something that people virtue signal about rather than
something that reflects real impact. Some of the most valuable work
exists in the messy, high-token exploratory phase that resists easy
measurement. 

 DESIGN IS MORE THAN CODE (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Design is about finding the right problem, the right intent, and the
right vision. The features you design and build today should be
considered a step toward that vision. Without the right context and
goal, you could be iterating toward a direction that wasn't chosen
intentionally. The industry is not very patient, but that doesn't mean
you should devalue the why behind your designs in favor of output.

 ELLISON'S HARDBALL WARNER BROS. TACTICS GAVE NETFLIX AN OPENING (14
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Lawyers for David Ellison sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery on
the night of December 3 expressing serious concerns about the fairness
and adequacy of the company's sale process. This surprised Warner
Bros., as the company believed it had run a fair process. Ellison's
inner circle tried to retract the statement, claiming some partners
didn't even know the letter was going out, but it was too late. In
response, Warner Bros. decided to sell to Netflix. 

 GRAPHITE GETS BOUGHT BY CURSOR: THREE REFLECTIONS FROM SIX YEARS OF
WORK (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Software quality startup Graphite has been acquired by code
generation startup Cursor. Graphite started out as Screenplay, which
couldn't find product-market fit right away. The conversations around
Graphite started right before the pandemic lockdowns. The team started
working in person together as soon as it was advisable, allowing them
to knit a culture early and build trust. The three founders took three
distinct roles, and they all remain vital to the company.
