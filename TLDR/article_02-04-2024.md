 THE DEVELOPER'S GUIDE TO USER MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Today, even smaller startups are demanding auth features like SSO
that used to be the purview of the Fortune 500.
This developer resource by WorkOS [4] covers the essentials of modern
day user management ‚Äî from 101 topics to more advanced concepts:

	* SSO, MFA, and sessions
	* Bot policies, org auth policies, and UI considerations
	* Identity linking, email verification, and just-in-time provisioning

 ‚ÄòAIRPODS LITE‚Äô TO DEBUT LATER THIS YEAR, NEW REPORT SAYS (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is expected to release multiple new models of its AirPods this
year. A report says that a new lower-cost AirPods Lite, priced at $99,
will be released sometime during the second half of 2024. There is
little information about what to expect from the lower-cost earbuds.
New AirPods Max are also coming later this year. The AirPods 4 will
feature a new design and a USB-C charging case. The higher-end variant
will feature noise cancellation. 

 GOOGLE AGREES TO DESTROY BROWSING DATA COLLECTED IN INCOGNITO MODE (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has agreed to destroy or de-identify billions of web browsing
data records collected from Incognito mode users as part of a proposed
class action settlement. The settlement also mandates greater
disclosure from the company about how it collects information in
Incognito mode and puts limits on future data collection. The proposed
settlement has been valued at around $5 billion, with plaintiffs
receiving zero in damages unless they individually file claims.

 TERRAFORM INDUSTRIES CONVERTS ELECTRICITY AND AIR INTO SYNTHETIC
NATURAL GAS FOR THE FIRST TIME (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Terraform Industries' Terraformer is a machine that uses electricity
and air to create hydrocarbons. It consists of an electrolyzer, a
direct air capture system, and a chemical reactor. Roughly the size of
two shipping containers, the machine produces pipeline-grade synthetic
natural gas using energy from a one-megawatt solar array. The system
converts clean energy into hydrogen at less than $2.50 a kilogram of
H2 and the direct air capture system filters CO2 for less than $250
per ton, a world record. 

 ROLLABLE OLED‚ÄôS MOMENT IS NEAR (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Flexible OLED technology isn't new: the first foldable OLED display
was released in 2018. Rollable displays are similar to foldable
displays, but they have proven difficult to produce. Tecno Mobile and
Motorola both recently presented rollable OLED concepts at the Mobile
World Congress technology convention in Barcelona. Samsung also
recently filed a patent for a future smartphone or tablet that rolls
up like a newspaper.

 Engineering teams want higher user flow coverage, but most struggle
to achieve it. That‚Äôs where QA Wolf (4.8 on G2) [9] comes in.

	* Take end-to-end testing completely off your plate.
	* Get 80% automated coverage in just 4 months [9].
	* Stay there with 24-hour maintenance, on-demand test creation,
unlimited parallel runs (their infra), and zero flakes guaranteed.

 SMALL DATA, BIG COMPUTE (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The typical business analyst query significantly underutilizes
compute. Large language models use a lot more compute and may bring on
another expansionary era of bloat. Most companies will not have the
budget to operate large language models on big data - most business
use cases will inevitably operate on less than a million rows of data.
The shift to small data will mean that data egress will no longer be a
moat and open up an opportunity for new GPU cloud competitors to
emerge. 

 XZBOT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 xzbot is a toolkit for exploring the xz backdoor. It includes a fake
vulnerable server to detect exploit attempts, a patch, a format of the
backdoor payload, and a tool to trigger the exploit. A list of
references for more information on the exploit is available.

 THE REMOTENESS OF REMOTE WORK (21 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Effective long-term remote work requires specific skill sets and DNA
to pull off. Many organizations suddenly transitioned to remote work
during the pandemic. While it worked out great in the first year, it
eventually became detrimental to creativity and collaboration, so some
companies switched back to hybrid in-office work where employees come
into the office several days a week. This article discusses how one
company handled the transition to remote work and then to hybrid work
and explains the lessons it learned from the experience. 

 THE INTERNET IS TOO SMALL FOR DATA-GUZZLING AI COMPANIES (9 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 AI systems are requiring larger and larger pools of data to learn
from. The available pool of data is now getting too small, and at the
same time, some data owners are blocking access to their information.
The industry's need for high-quality text data could outstrip supply
within two years. The data shortage is a frontier research problem, so
many efforts to solve it are currently being done in secret as the
solution could be a competitive advantage.

 10 > 64, IN QR CODES (17 MINUTE READ) [15]

of QR codes containing URLs, why it works, and how the technique
allows shoveling maximum data into a URL in a QR code.

 A tree that was barely tall enough to interfere with a Wi-Fi bridge
signal was weighed down just enough when it rained that the
interference stopped.
