 THE MEMORY WARS: WHY THE FUTURE KARPATHY, MUSK, AND JIM FAN SEE
REQUIRES 16-HI HBM (15 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The infrastructure buildout happening right now may be a sign that
the AI chip competition may already be over. Nvidia recently requested
16-Hi HBM deliveries from Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron by Q4 2026.
This infrastructure layer could make AI inference effectively infinite
and nearly free at the margin. The rollout of capability is arriving
faster than our ability to conceptualize what to do with it. 

 NVIDIA GROQ UPDATE: EVERYONE GETS RICH, PATENT WARFARE BEGINS (7
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 All of Groq's VCs, employees, founders, and the whole cap table will
get paid from the recent acquisition by Nvidia. 85% of the payment
will be up front, with the rest coming by the end of 2026. Nvidia will
likely weaponize the patents it gained from the acquisition to create
a 'scorched-earth zone' around SRAM-based inference. GroqCloud has
become a shell of its former self with no IP and no technical
leadership.

 ALZHEIMER'S: FROM CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS TO MODELS AND INTERVENTIONS
(14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is caused by multiple factors. Each
individual factor doesn't necessarily guarantee an AD diagnosis in
every situation, but it increases the odds of it all else being equal.
Preventing AD and reversing or stopping the disease are two separate
areas of research. Attempting to modify risk factors of the disease
once it has already started is unlikely to lead to a cure. Targeting
the underlying dynamics of the disease is a more likely pathway to a
treatment. 

 PROPOSED SPACE STATION COULD BE DEPLOYED IN A SINGLE LAUNCH (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Max Space's Thunderbird is designed to host four astronauts in an
expandable interior structure that can be reconfigured by the crew to
support different activities. It can be used for research as well as
orbital manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and other materials. The
space station can be launched on a medium-lift vehicle such as the
Falcon 9 rocket. The Thunderbird space station is set to launch as
early as 2029.

 A GUIDE TO CLAUDE CODE 2.0 AND GETTING BETTER AT USING CODING AGENTS
(55 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Claude Code dominated the CLI coding product experience this year.
This guide shows readers the thought processes and simple things to
keep in mind to get the most out of Claude Code. Learning how things
work in Claude Code directly transfers to other tools, both in terms
of personal usage and production-grade engineering. The post will help
users keep up with coding agents in general. 

 HOW I THINK ABOUT KUBERNETES (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Kubernetes is often described as a container orchestration tool, but
that mental model isn't always the most useful way to think about
what's happening. It is more like a platform where developers declare
the desired state of their infrastructure and let the system
continuously work to match that intent. In that way, Kubernetes is
more like a runtime for declarative infrastructure with a type system.
Thinking this way results in very practical approaches to operating
clusters.

 12 OUTLOOKS FOR THE FUTURE: 2026+ (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 2026 will hopefully be full of surprises and developments that give
us hope for healthier and more fulfilling work and lives. The AI hype
cycle will die down, allowing the most meaningful innovations to
become clear. This post takes a look at what we should expect in the
coming year and beyond, and what the implications of that will be. 

 JEVONS PARADOX FOR KNOWLEDGE WORK (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Tech-driven efficiency improvements tend to lead to massive growth
because there are more use cases for the resources than previously
contemplated. AI is going to lead to a lot more knowledge work by
making it cheaper, as that allows people to take on tasks previously
unimaginable. The vast majority of AI tokens in the future will be
used on things that we don't even do today. AI will enable work that
previously wouldn't have been considered, as it would have been too
expensive or impractical.
