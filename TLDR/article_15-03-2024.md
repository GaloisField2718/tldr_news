 SPACEX CELEBRATES MAJOR PROGRESS ON THE THIRD FLIGHT OF STARSHIP (7
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX's Starship rocket flew halfway around the world yesterday,
accomplishing a key demonstration of its ability to carry heavy
payloads into low-Earth orbit. The successful launch builds on two
previous flights last year. Thursday's flight tested Starship's
payload bay door and performed a precursor test of an in-orbit
refueling system. Photos from the launch are available in the article.


 WHO COULD BUY TIKTOK? THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO COULD ACQUIRE THE APP
(7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ByteDance may have to sell TikTok in the US if a proposed bill passes
the Senate. Some high-profile investors, including former Treasury
Secretary Steven Mnuchin, online video platform Rumble, and former
Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, have expressed interest in
acquiring the app. This article presents a list of known potential
buyers along with a primer on companies that have previously tried to
purchase TikTok.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 EVO: DNA FOUNDATION MODELING FROM MOLECULAR TO GENOME SCALE (9 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Evo is a long-context biological foundation model capable of both
prediction tasks and generative design, from molecular to whole genome
scale. The model generalizes across the fundamental languages of
biology, DNA, RNA, and proteins to generate DNA sequences using a
context length of 131k tokens. It is based on StripedHyena, a deep
signal processing architecture designed to improve efficiency and
quality over prevailing Transformer architecture. A playground is
available where users can generate DNA in their browsers using Evo. 

 GENETICALLY MODIFIED COW MAKES MILK WITH HUMAN INSULIN (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Researchers have engineered a cow capable of producing milk that
contains human insulin. This could result in an alternative for
insulin production. The process involves inserting human DNA coding
for insulin into cow embryos. It could dramatically simplify the
process and cost of producing the drug. A single cow can produce
enough milk every day to supply thousands of type 1 diabetes patients
with their daily insulin for an entire month. Scaling up production,
ensuring the health and welfare of the transgenic cows, and navigating
regulatory approvals are still huge challenges that lie ahead before
the process can replace conventional methods of insulin production.

 FALSEHOODS PROGRAMMERS BELIEVE ABOUT TIME ZONES (10 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Building a time zone conversion layer on top of a datetime library
sounds like an easy task, but it isn't. This article lists 21
misconceptions about time zones the author had before attempting to
write a time zone conversion app as well as extra misconceptions from
readers. These misconceptions include thinking that there are more
countries in the world than time zones, that every time zone has
exactly one agreed-upon name, or that time zones are always offset
from UTC by an integer number of hours. 

 HTTP/2 AND HTTP/3 EXPLAINED (25 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The first HTTP draft had only one method, GET - there were no headers
or status codes, and the only data format available was HTML. The
protocol has evolved significantly since then. HTTP/3 is designed for
unstable connections, resulting in performance tradeoffs. HTTP/2
offers better performance on reliable and stable connections than
HTTP/3. Servers can accept both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections so
clients can make the decision of which version to use.

 THE TOP 100 GEN AI CONSUMER APPS (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI-native products and companies are growing faster and engaging
users more deeply than ever before. Over the coming decade, AI will
likely underpin category-defining companies. This article examines
data on the most popular generative AI products to uncover patterns on
how consumers are using the technology. It looks at the rate of
progress in the industry, emerging categories, hot niches, the mobile
vs web split, and AI as a global pursuit. 

 THE CURSE OF THE SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Titles help normalize pay ranges and allow for progression and
evaluation. People who are not job hoppers or get stuck in the same
company and title due to laziness, comfort, or other reasons are
unfortunately prone to 'The Curse of the Senior Software Engineer'.
This is when an engineer who has been senior for too long finds
themselves between two worlds upon their next job search: they are too
senior to be hired as a senior or they have too little leadership
experience to be hired in a leadership position. Avoiding the curse
involves either playing by corporate rules or exiting the game by
switching to self-employment.
