MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has added a new feature to its Claude AI chatbot that lets
users build AI-powered apps right inside the app. It builds on
Anthropic's Artifacts feature, which lets users see and interact with
what they ask Claude to make. The feature has been used to build
things like AI-powered games, learning tools, data analysis apps,
writing assistants, and agent workflows. A video demo showing how the
feature works is available in the article. 

 SPANISH MATHEMATICIAN JAVIER GÓMEZ SERRANO AND GOOGLE DEEPMIND TEAM
UP TO SOLVE THE NAVIER-STOKES MILLION-DOLLAR PROBLEM (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The Navier-Stokes equations are one of the seven Millennium Prize
Problems - the US-based Clay Mathematics Institute has offered $1
million for the solution. Google DeepMind and mathematician Javier
Gómez Serrano claim the problem will be solved soon with the help of
AI. The challenge dates back to the 19th century. Several great
mathematical minds have devoted the best years of their academic lives
to solving the problem only to find themselves stuck in a dead end.

 SPACEX LAUNCHES 4 PEOPLE INTO ORBIT ON AXIOM SPACE AX-4 MISSION (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SpaceX launched a private space crew of four people on a SpaceX
Falcon 9 rocket on Wednesday. The mission was brokered by commercial
space company Axiom Space. The Ax-4 mission will catch up with and
dock to the International Space Station in a SpaceX Dragon capsule on
Thursday morning. The crew will be conducting research that spans
biology, material, and physical sciences, as well as technology
demonstrations during their 14-day stay. They will engage with
students around the world to share their experiences. The Dragon
capsule will remain docked at the station during the mission. 

 ALPHAGENOME: AI FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE GENOME (15 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 AlphaGenome is a new unifying DNA sequence model that advances
regulatory variant-effect prediction and promises to shed new light on
genome function. It is now available via API for non-commercial
research. The tool can predict how single variants or mutations in
human DNA sequences impact a wide range of biological processes
regulating genes. It can help scientists better understand genome
function and disease biology and drive new biological discoveries and
the development of new treatments.

 A BETTER SOLUTION TO JIRA BULK EDITING (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Jira's native bulk editing is… not great. It doesn't take long to
run into unavailable operations, inconsistent system fields, and
complex field configurations. Appfire's JXL for Jira [10] is a
powerful, spreadsheet-like solution easy to update selected issues,
bulk transition issues, and stop watching multiple issues. Read the
blog [10] 

 CONTAINERS ARE AVAILABLE IN PUBLIC BETA FOR SIMPLE, GLOBAL, AND
PROGRAMMABLE COMPUTE (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Cloudflare Containers are now available in beta for all users on paid
plans. The feature enables developers to run new kinds of applications
alongside Workers, opening up a world of possibilities. Containers are
tightly integrated with Workers and the rest of the developer
platform. This article provides a tour of Containers for developers to

 BEGUN, THE AI BROWSER WARS HAVE (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Browser Company's new Dia browser shows an obvious glimpse of
what's to come in the world of web browsers. It is a lot simpler than
Arc, but the AI trade-offs make it worth the switch. Established
players like Chrome have billions of users, making it difficult for
them to fundamentally change their browsers overnight. With Dia, The
Browser Company has a clean slate to do as it wishes - and it appears
to be a good product right now. 

 RACK-SCALE NETWORKS ARE THE NEW HOTNESS FOR MASSIVE AI TRAINING AND
INFERENCE WORKLOADS (13 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Rack-scale architectures use interconnect technologies to offer
several orders of magnitude higher bandwidth per accelerator. The
bandwidth means that GPU compute and memory can be pooled, even when
physically distributed across multiple distinct servers. The
transition to rack-scale architectures is being driven by the demands
of model builders. They are primarily aimed at hyperscale cloud
providers, neo-cloud operators, and large enterprises that need to
keep their AI workloads on-prem.
