 LEAKED DECK REVEALS HOW OPENAI IS PITCHING PUBLISHER PARTNERSHIPS (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has been pitching partnership opportunities to news publishers
through its Preferred Publishers Program. The company has been
courting premium publishers since July last year when it struck a deal
with the Associated Press. It has since inked deals with Axel
Springer, The Financial Times, Le Monde, Prisa, and Dotdash Meredith.
OpenAI negotiates deals on a per-publisher basis rather than
structuring all of its deals uniformly. While some publishers have
opted to partner with OpenAI, others have sued the tech firm for using
copyrighted articles without permission.

MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Microsoft is aiming to launch its Xbox mobile gaming store in July.
The company plans to bring its own first-party portfolio to the store.
The store will also provide key parts of the Xbox experience, allowing
players' identities, libraries, and rewards to travel across
ecosystems. It is unclear how Microsoft will position the store as an
alternative for games already existing on rival app stores. The store
will initially be web-only.

 INTUITIVE MACHINES ON TRACK FOR SECOND MOON TRIP, FOUNDER SAYS (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Intuitive Machines Inc. is planning for another trip to the Moon
during the last three months of 2024. The mission will aim to install
a 4G network on the surface of the Moon. Intuitive Machines made
history less than a year ago by setting down the first privately built
lander intact on the Moon's surface. The company went public last year
via a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company,
making its founder a billionaire several times over. 

 A SKEPTIC'S TAKE ON BEAMING POWER TO EARTH FROM SPACE (13 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 While the idea of space-based solar power sounds good, there are many
potential problems that could doom such a project. Such a misadventure
would undermine the credibility of the responsible space agency and
waste capital that could be spent improving less risky methods of
renewable energy. This article presents a roadmap of the potential
challenges that must be overcome before orbital solar power can become
truly appealing to electrical utilities.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

mathematical patterns and work with huge expressions. Symbolica

 THE SEARCH FOR EASIER SAFE SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Getting to a level where you're comfortable using Rust can be
difficult. June is a safe systems language that can be learned as
quickly as one can learn Go. It features grouped allocations,
arbitrary data structures, full encapsulation, and safe memory
recycling. This article introduces June and discusses its features and
development. June could become a good complement to Rust once Rust has
a stable ABI.

 DANGEROUS PROTOCOLS (32 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Protocols are a potential alternative to walled technology gardens.
They offer a level of interoperability and customization that
platforms don't. A historical look at protocols suggests that their
purpose has always been to simplify coordination and communication,
leading to conformity over time. Protocols are not owned or mediated
by any central authority, so switching protocols isn't as easy as
switching platforms. While protocols are not necessarily bad, it is
important to acknowledge the dangerous implications of increasingly
outsourcing more decisions to them. 

 LOG SCALES (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article contains a lesson on log scales. It covers the basics,
like linear scales, before moving on to more advanced topics such as
exponentials, symmetry, homoscedasticity, and more. The article uses
many charts and graphs to help visualize the concepts it discusses. It
focuses on log10, where segments represent a tenfold increase compared
to the last, but there are many other types of log bases to also be
aware of that offer different perspectives and may be better suited
for specific situations or data types.
