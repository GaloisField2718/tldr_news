 OPENAI UNVEILS GPT-4.5 ‘ORION,' ITS LARGEST AI MODEL YET (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is now rolling out GPT-4.5 to ChatGPT Pro subscribers and
developers on paid tiers of the company's API. Other users should get
the model sometime next week. GPT-4.5 is so expensive to run that
OpenAI is evaluating whether to continue serving the model on its API
in the long term. It currently costs $75 for every million input
tokens and $150 for every million output tokens. This article looks at
how the new model compares to OpenAI's other offerings. 

 META PLANS TO RELEASE STANDALONE META AI APP IN EFFORT TO COMPETE
WITH OPENAI'S CHATGPT (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta intends to debut a standalone Meta AI app during the second
quarter. The service is currently only available to users via a
website and the company's other apps. Users could potentially interact
more deeply with the digital assistant if it were available as a
standalone app. Meta also plans to test a paid subscription for Meta
AI.

 FIGURE WILL START ‘ALPHA TESTING' ITS HUMANOID ROBOT IN THE HOME IN
2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figure plans to begin alpha testing its Figure 02 robot in the home
later this year. The project's timeline was accelerated thanks to the
company's 'generalist' Vision-Language-Action model, Helix. Helix is
designed to process both visual data and natural language input to
accelerate learning. It can orchestrate two robots working on a single
task in tandem. 

 ANTI-AGING PILL FOR DOGS CERTIFIED AS 'EFFECTIVE' BY FDA. BUT COULD
IT WORK FOR HUMANS, TOO? (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Biotech startup Loyal has received a certification from the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) saying its anti-aging pill for dogs has
a reasonable expectation of efficacy. The pill still needs to be
certified by the FDA that it is safe for use and can be manufactured
at a greater scale before it can be prescribed by veterinarians. Loyal
plans to earn conditional approval from the FDA by the end of the
year.

 DEAR STUDENT: YES, AI IS HERE, YOU'RE SCREWED UNLESS YOU TAKE
ACTION... (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI will soon start having a large impact on software engineering.
Students should start learning fundamentals that universities
typically don't teach and obtain skills that are going to be highly
desirable to every employer. Developers need to learn how their work
directly translates to business value and build a public profile.
Software engineers will be fine, as long as they take action now. 

 SUPERGLUE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 superglue is a self-healing open source data connector that can be
deployed as a proxy so developers always get the data they want in the
format they expect. Developers just define their desired data schemas
and provide basic instructions about an API endpoint - superglue
automatically generates the API configuration, handles pagination,
authentication, and error retries, transforms response data into the
exact schema developers want using JSONata expressions, and validates
that data, fixing transformations when they break.

 GOOGLE'S SERGEY BRIN URGES WORKERS TO THE OFFICE ‘AT LEAST' EVERY
WEEKDAY (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Sergey Brin, one of Google's co-founders, says that Google could be
the leader in artificial general intelligence if employees worked
harder. He recommends that employees attend the office at least every
weekday, saying that 60 hours a week is the sweet spot for
productivity. Brin returned to Google after ChatGPT's launch to help
the company navigate the difficult moment when it lost its advantage
in AI. Since his return, Google has reorganized its business,
rebranded its AI, and rolled out the technology across its popular
apps.
