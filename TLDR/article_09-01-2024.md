READ) [8] 

 Waymo's fully driverless vehicles will soon start carrying passengers
to and from their destinations on Phoenix's freeways. The company will
start by offering driverless rides to just employees and their friends
before opening up the service to other paying passengers. Waymo will
use the data and feedback collected from these passengers to improve
the service as it increases the number of miles it drives on highways.
Using highways will allow Waymo to provide faster routes, especially
for customers traveling to Phoenix's airports.

 FROM LG TO SAMSUNG, TRANSPARENT LED DISPLAYS THAT PROJECT FILMS ON
GLASS SHAKE UP CES 2024 (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LG and Samsung have unveiled transparent LED displays that project
movies and images on glass-like holograms. LG's Signature OLED TV has
a single see-through glass display that uses wireless AV transmission
and reception technology to eliminate all kinds of wires other than
the power source around the transparent screen. Samsung's transparent
MICRO LED display can animate motionless surroundings and objects.
Pictures and videos of both displays are available in the article. 

 SCIENTISTS RESTORE VISION IN MICE, ACHIEVE 170-FOLD GENE EDITING
BOOST (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Scientists at MIT and Harvard have designed tiny virus-like particles
that can carry prime editors into mouse cells with a high success rate
to correct a genetic disorder. The technique improves the editing
process by 170 times in human cells. It was able to correct genetic
mistakes and restore vision when tested on mice with genetic eye
problems without creating any unintended changes.

 ATTACKS ON MACHINE LEARNING MODELS (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This blog attempts to shine a light on the topic of attacks on
machine learning models. It aims to inform readers about neural
network attacks, a topic worthy of attention for those deploying
machine learning models in production. Machine learning models are
just as susceptible to attacks as other systems, but they are extra
hard to protect as they have both code and data vulnerabilities.
Current defenses are not enough, and real fixes may require massive
changes to model development. As long as model development involves
pattern matching, attacks can never be truly prevented. 

 WHAT PWA CAN DO TODAY (WEBSITE) [12]

 CUTTING-EDGE TECH IS AT CES 2024. THESE ARE OUR FAVES TODAY (7 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 This year's CES underscores how people are increasingly craving more
niche devices and longing for the past. It also highlights the ways
that AI is becoming more integrated into people's lives. This page
presents the best tech highlights as they are announced this week in
Las Vegas. The devices so far include a phone that folds backwards, a
gaming laptop that weighs only 3.6 pounds, a thermometer that checks
blood oxygen and heart rate readings, and a 115-inch 4K LCD TV that's
up to five times brighter than most TVs. 

 STATE OF AI & PREDICTIONS FOR 2024 (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article shares thoughts on the state of AI along with some
predictions on where the technology is going. It looks at where
products built with AI models are today, focusing on products,
markets, and people. The article doesn't cover the technical details
of architectures and the infrastructure of AI. This year, open source
models will catch up with proprietary models and help push inference
to edge devices everywhere.
