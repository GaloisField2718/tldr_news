 ELON MUSK'S XAI RAISES $10 BILLION IN DEBT AND EQUITY AS IT STEPS UP
CHALLENGE TO OPENAI (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 xAI has raised a combined $10 billion in debt and equity through
secured notes, term loans, and a strategic equity investment. The
funding will give the startup more firepower to build out
infrastructure and develop its Grok AI chatbot. xAI has already

 SAM ALTMAN SLAMS META'S AI TALENT-POACHING SPREE: ‘MISSIONARIES
WILL BEAT MERCENARIES' (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has hinted that the company is evaluating
compensation for the entire research organization in response to Meta
CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent AI talent-poaching spree. He has
dismissed the recruiting efforts, saying that Meta's actions will lead
to deep cultural problems down the road. Altman says that Meta failed
to get OpenAI's top people and that Meta had to go quite far down the
list.

 MODERNA SAYS MRNA FLU VACCINE SAILED THROUGH TRIAL, BEATING STANDARD
SHOT (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Moderna's mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccine was 27% more effective at
preventing influenza infections than a standard flu shot in a study
that included nearly 41,000 people aged 50 and above. The new shot,
dubbed mRNA-1010, hit the highest efficacy target set for the trial.
The positive results come in the wake of one of the worst flu seasons
in years. An estimated 770,000 people in the US were hospitalized for
the flu during the 2024-2025 flu season. 

 TESLA UNVEILS ITS LFP BATTERY FACTORY, CLAIMS IT'S ALMOST READY (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tesla claims that its lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery cell
factory in Nevada is nearly ready to start production. The company's
cheapest electric vehicles all utilize LFP cells, as does its entire
range of energy storage products - it currently heavily relies on
Chinese manufacturers. Tesla aims to produce about 10 GWh of LFP
battery cells per year at the new factory. The cells are expected to
be used in the Tesla Megapack, which is produced in the US.

 CONTEXT ENGINEERING REALIZED: CONTEXT WINDOW ARCHITECTURE (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The Context Window Architecture (CWA) is a conceptual reference
architecture aimed at bringing engineering discipline to every large
language model (LLM) prompt construction. It directly addresses
fundamental limitations with LLMs, including statelessness, cognitive
fallibility, and ad-hoc prompting. The real value of an AI application
isn't just the LLM, but the system intelligently managing its context.
Adopting CWA increases reliability, predictability, debuggability, and
security; lowers maintenance requirements; creates clear control
points for sensitive data, ethical guidelines, and compliance; and
provides a shared vocabulary and mental model for collaborative
development. 

 I SHIPPED A MACOS APP BUILT ENTIRELY BY CLAUDE CODE (19 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Context is a native app for debugging MCP servers powered by Apple's
SwiftUI framework. It was built almost completely by Claude Code. Of
the 20,000 lines in the project, less than 1,000 lines were written by
hand. This post explains how Context's developer chose their tools,
what those tools are good at and bad at, and how other developers can
leverage them to maximize the quality of their generated code output.
IDEs of the future will focus on enabling developers to prime context
for agents and set up the feedback loops that are essential to helping
agents succeed with tasks.

 PAY UP OR STOP SCRAPING: CLOUDFLARE PROGRAM CHARGES BOTS FOR EACH
CRAWL (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Cloudflare is experimenting with a new feature that allows content
creators to charge a fee to stop AI crawlers from scraping their
websites. The 'pay-per-crawl' feature is currently in a private beta -
any content creator interested in joining can sign up. It allows
publishers to set a price for bots to pay before scraping content.
Publishers have the option to charge some bots while letting other
bots scrape for free. 

 CHINA IS QUICKLY ERODING AMERICA'S LEAD IN THE GLOBAL AI RACE (11
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Companies and organizations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and
Asia are turning to large language models from Chinese companies as
alternatives to offerings from the US. While US AI technology is
widely seen as the industry's gold standard, Chinese companies offer
performance that is nearly as good at vastly lower prices. Leading
Chinese AI companies have open-sourced their models, which could
pressure rivals in the US to justify keeping their models private and
the premiums they charge for their services.
