 üÜï DRATA AND LEADING AUDITORS ANNOUNCE NEW CODE OF ETHICS FOR FAIR,
TRANSPARENT, AND QUALITY-DRIVEN AUDITS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 For an audit to be trustworthy, customers need to be assured of the
integrity, objectivity, professionalism, transparency, and high
quality of the firm performing the audit. However, standards in this
area have traditionally been lax.

The newly-announced Code of Ethics [4] outlines principles and
guidelines that member firms of the Auditor Alliance are expected to
follow. It ensures a fair, transparent, and quality-driven audit
process [4] for customers seeking compliance with standards,
regulations, and frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR,
PCI, and others.

 TESLA LAUNCHES WORLD'S FIRST ALL-ELECTRIC 'GIGA TRAIN' WITH
MIND-BLOWING PASSENGER CAPACITY ‚Äî AND IT'S FREE TO RIDE (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Tesla's Giga Train has debuted in Germany. The all-electric
battery-powered train can currently transport 500 people, with 120
seats and space for bicycles. It takes passengers to a station located
near Tesla's manufacturing facility about 20 miles southeast of
Berlin. It's free to ride for regular passengers, not just Tesla
employees. The train is expected to eventually transport 4,500
employees to and from the factory. An additional stop will be added
once construction in the area is completed. 

 APPLE IS THINKING ABOUT A RIVAL TO META RAY-BAN GLASSES (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Apple is reportedly considering developing non-AR smart glasses to
rival the Meta Ray-Ban glasses. It was previously renewing its efforts
to build augmented reality smart glasses but is now considering less
ambitious options. Removing AR features should result in a cheaper
bill of materials and less complex development, allowing Apple to
bring them to market much faster than AR-equipped specs. Samsung is
also working on a pair of smart glasses, expected to be powered by
Google software.

 SPACEX WILL START LAUNCHING STARSHIPS TO MARS IN 2026, ELON MUSK SAYS
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX aims to send its Starship megarocket on Mars missions two
years from now. The company will start with uncrewed tests, with the
first crewed flights starting in four years. It aims to build a
self-sustaining city in about 20 years. Starship's fifth test flight
could take place soon - the company has already performed test-fires
with the Super Heavy and the Starship that will fly the mission. The
next test will involve the first attempt to land Super Heavy back on
the launch mount. 

 COMMON FOOD DYE LETS SCIENTISTS SEE THROUGH SKIN (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stanford University researchers have discovered a yellow dye that
transforms opaque tissue into a transparent window, allowing them to
see the inner workings of living animals. Applied to the abdomen of a
mouse, the dye allowed scientists to see its liver, small intestine,
bladder, and other organs down to the resolution of microns. Rinsing
off the dye with water reverses the process. The technology could have
many applications, including assisting in the early detection and
treatment of cancers. A picture of the transparent mouse abdomen is
available in the article.

 THE END OF THE 1 BILLION ACTIVE USER AD-SUPPORTED CONSUMER STARTUP -
AND WHY HIGHLY-MONETIZING, USEFUL, VERTICAL APPS ARE THE NEXT THING (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 It might not be possible anymore to create a broadly horizontal
consumer app. Easy growth is mostly over and building an ad-supported
business is harder than ever. The next generation of apps may be
'vertical apps' that appeal to a vertical market segment with smaller
audiences but higher 'whale' monetization. These apps will be focused
on solo, useful interactions and may target productivity/utility use
cases.

judge on the case will take into account the swiftly changing
technological landscape, including potential new competition from
companies like OpenAI and Microsoft.
