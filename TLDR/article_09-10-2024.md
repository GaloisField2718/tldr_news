 SPACEX'S NEXT STARSHIP LAUNCH—AND FIRST CATCH—COULD HAPPEN THIS
WEEKEND (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SpaceX's Starship rocket could fly again as soon as Sunday. The test
is still pending FAA approval. The last public statement released by
the FAA suggested the agency didn't expect to determine whether to
approve the license before late November, but there is some optimism
at SpaceX that it will issue a launch license much sooner. The fifth
Starship test flight will attempt the first-ever return to the launch
site and catch of the Super Heavy booster. SpaceX won't attempt to
reignite Starship's Raptor engines in space on the upcoming flight -
the spacecraft will come to a soft splashdown in a target area in the
Indian Ocean. 

 SAMSUNG SAYS IT'S IN “CRISIS,” APOLOGIZES FOR MISSING PROFIT
TARGET (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Samsung issued a public apology and acknowledged it is in a 'crisis'
following the release of its profit guidance on Tuesday. It reported a
preliminary profit that undershot market expectations, and its share
price has fallen almost 30% over the past six months. The
worse-than-expected guidance underlines investor concerns about
deteriorating memory market conditions and the possibility of slowing
AI investment by big tech groups. Samsung is cutting some of its
overseas staff and wrestling with growing worker discontent at home.

 GROUNDBREAKING OVARIAN CANCER VACCINE AT AN "EXCITING" MOMENT, LEAD
SCIENTIST SAYS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scientists at Oxford have started developing an ovarian cancer
vaccine that imbues the immune system with the ability to recognize
and attack early-stage ovarian cancer cells. The research is currently
focusing on women with one or two specific mutations known to be
linked to a higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The vaccine
still needs to go through several rounds of trials, a process that
could take years, before human clinical trials can begin. 

 HOW LONG TIL WE'RE ALL ON OZEMPIC? (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The supply of GLP-1 medications like Ozempic has been plagued with
shortages. While companies are doing what they can to increase supply,
it is extremely unlikely that demand will be met in the near term.
This article looks at growth for GLP-1 drugs over the next six years
and how many people will stand to benefit from them over this time.
More than two in five people in the US are overweight, so increasing
access to the drug will have a large benefit on the population.

 COGNITIVE LOAD IS WHAT MATTERS (28 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Cognitive load is how much a developer needs to think in order to
complete a task. Confusion, which is caused by high cognitive load,
costs time and money. Developers spend far more time reading and
understanding code than writing it, so they should constantly ask
themselves whether they are embedding excessive cognitive load into
their code and reduce that load.

 AUTOMATTIC IS DOING OPEN SOURCE DIRTY (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Automattic demanding 8% of WP Engine's revenues for not 'giving back
enough' to WordPress is a violation of general open source ideals and
the specifics of the GPL license. The potential damage to the open
source world extends far beyond WordPress. Open source has been
successful over the last several decades because of the clarity and
certainty of its licensing regime, which allows people to build a
business on open source without fear of frivolous claims or surprise
shakedowns. The integrity of these licenses is under direct assault by
Automattic's claim for WP Engine's revenues. Automattic is able to
change its license away from the GPL if it wishes. 

 THE DISAPPEARANCE OF AN INTERNET DOMAIN (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The British Government announced last week that it was transferring
the sovereignty of an island in the Indian Ocean to the country of
Mauritius, spelling the end of the .io domain suffix. This article
looks at how geopolitical changes can unexpectedly disrupt the digital
world. It explores historical precedents and office valuable context
for tech founders, users, and observers. It also provides a look at
the unexpected intersection of international relations and internet
infrastructure.
