 FIGURE AI'S NEW HUMANOID ROBOT CAN FOLD YOUR CLOTHES, DO THE DISHES
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figure 03 is a general-purpose humanoid robot that can perform a wide
range of chores at home. It uses an AI-powered system called Helix to
see and execute complex actions without a predetermined script. At 5
feet and 6 inches tall, the 132-pound robot can run for five hours on
a single charge. The company aims to release the robot in 2026, but
acknowledges that the goal is a big push. A video from Figure AI
introducing the robot is available in the article. 

 INTEL DEBUTS NEW TECHNOLOGY IN MAKE-OR-BREAK MOMENT FOR CEO'S
TURNAROUND BID (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Intel's Panther Lake processor designs are in full production and
will go on sale in laptops early next year. The chips are made with
18A technology, the most advanced chip production technology developed
and employed in the US. Intel needs to show that new products will win
back lost market share and attract customers to its foundry position.
The Panther Lake processor will more readily balance a PC's need to
run demanding software without rapidly draining batteries.

 CHINA LAUNCHES WORLD'S FIRST DUAL-TOWER SOLAR-THERMAL POWER PLANT IN
THE GOBI DESERT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 China just launched a solar-thermal power plant that utilizes a
dual-tower system to generate electricity in the Gobi Desert. The
station features two 656-feet-high towers, each surrounded by a vast
field of 27,000 mirrors. Known as heliostats, the mirrors concentrate
sunlight onto the towers. The stored heat is used to generate steam,
allowing the production of electricity well after sunset or during
cloudy weather. The technology harnesses heat instead of sunlight,
making it one of the few renewable technologies capable of providing
stable, dispatchable energy on demand. 

 A BUILT-IN ‘OFF SWITCH' TO STOP PERSISTENT PAIN (4 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Researchers have identified a key group of cells involved in
regulating long-term pain states in the brainstem. These neurons are
activated during enduring pain states and also integrate information
about hunger, fear, and thirst, allowing for pain signals to be
modulated by other brain circuits signaling more urgent needs. These
circuits can reduce the activity of neurons that transmit the signal
of pain. The research opens up a new path for the treatment of chronic
pain.

 EMBRACING THE PARALLEL CODING AGENT LIFESTYLE (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coding agent software is still really new. Models have only really
become good enough to drive them in the past few months. One of the
ways to use this software is to run multiple coding agents at once,
sometimes in the same repo and against multiple checkouts or git work
trees. This approach increases the number of tasks that can be fired
off in parallel without adding too much cognitive overhead. This post
discusses patterns for applying parallel agents effectively. 

 BITTER LESSONS BUILDING AI PRODUCTS (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 You shouldn't try to make AI work for your existing roadmap with
fancy, clever engineering because much of it will be obsolete with the
next major model upgrade. Instead, aim to understand model
capabilities and how you can best pivot your roadmap accordingly.
Companies need to learn to kill projects quicker if they need to hack
together a solution to make up for intelligence. Just wait a few
months and retry the idea when a new model drops.

 A MYSTERY CEO AND BILLIONS IN SALES: IS CHINA BUYING BANNED NVIDIA
CHIPS? (20 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Singaporean firm Megaspeed is being scrutinized by US officials for
its ties to China. US officials are investigating whether Megaspeed is
helping China sidestep US export restrictions by diverting some of its
Nvidia chips to China. Megaspeed has funneled most of its Nvidia chips
to data centers in Malaysia and Indonesia to remotely serve customers
in China, which is not illegal, but could be found unlawful if it is
done on behalf of a Chinese company. Nvidia says there is no evidence
that its chips have been smuggled into China and that Megaspeed is a
company wholly owned and operated outside of China with no Chinese
shareholders. 

 GOOGLE STRUGGLES WITH REMOTE WORK, DRASTICALLY CUTTING ‘WORK FROM
ANYWHERE' POLICY (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A single Work from Anywhere (WFA) day logged by Google employees in a
standard workweek will now count as a full WFA week, deducted from the
yearly balance. Employees are allowed to work from a non-main office
location for up to four weeks per calendar year. It is now best for
employees to spend the whole week working remotely to make the most
out of their WFA allowance. The WFA policy is designed for people
taking trips - Google maintains a separate work-from-home policy that
allows employees to work from home two days per week.
