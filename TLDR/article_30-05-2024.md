focuses on gaming and safety. At $229, the smartwatch can track a
child's activity as they play throughout the day. With 16 hours of
battery life, the Ace LTE is resistant to drops and can be submerged
in up to 164 feet of water. It is available now for preorder and will

 APPLE'S AI PLANS INVOLVES 'BLACK BOX' FOR CLOUD DATA (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Apple is expected to announce AI implementations into iOS 18 and its
other operating systems at WWDC. The company intends to process data
from AI applications inside a virtual black box that will use only
Apple's hardware to perform AI processing in the cloud. The approach
will prevent both Apple and potential hackers from being able to see
app data. Using a cloud approach allows Apple to reduce the hardware
requirements of its products.

 NEURALINK WANTS 3 MORE QUADRIPLEGIC PATIENTS FOR ITS BRAIN CONTROL
INTERFACE TRIAL (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Neuralink is recruiting another three subjects for its brain implant
study. It is seeking subjects aged 22 to 75 with severe quadriplegia
due to spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for at
least one year without improvement. Healthy people, people with morbid
obesity, or people with an active device already implanted are
disqualified from the study. Participants will be monitored for
adverse events for 72 months following the implantation procedure. 

 NEW BYD HYBRID CAN DRIVE NON-STOP FOR MORE THAN 2,000 KILOMETERS (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 BYD has unveiled a new hybrid powertrain that can travel for more
than 2,000 kilometers without recharging or refueling. Vehicles with
the technology can travel from New York to Miami on a single charge
and a full tank of gas. The upgraded tech will be launched in the Qin
L and the Seal 06. Both mid-sized sedans, which were unveiled at the
Beijing Auto Show in April, cost under $13,800.

 THREE LAWS OF SOFTWARE COMPLEXITY (OR: WHY SOFTWARE ENGINEERS ARE
ALWAYS GRUMPY) (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Software engineers are destined to wallow in unnecessary complexity
due to three fundamental laws: a well-designed system will degrade
into a badly designed system over time, complexity is a moat filled by
leaky abstractions, and there is no fundamental upper limit on
software complexity. Building a new system from scratch without
succumbing to these laws is a lot harder than it sounds. Engineers who
work on badly designed systems suffer more as badly designed systems
have unbound complexity. 

 WHAT WE LEARNED FROM A YEAR OF BUILDING WITH LLMS (PART I) (45 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 While the barrier to entry for building AI products has lowered,
creating something effective beyond a demo remains a deceptively
difficult endeavor. This series of articles identifies crucial lessons
and methodologies for developing products based on large language
models gathered by people who have been building real-world
applications on top of ML systems over the past year. It is organized
into three sections: tactical, operational, and strategic. This first
part dives into the tactical nuts and bolts of working with large
language models and shares best practices and common pitfalls around
prompting, setting up retrieval-augmented generation, applying flow
engineering, and evaluation and monitoring.

 HOW A.I. MADE MARK ZUCKERBERG POPULAR AGAIN IN SILICON VALLEY (10
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 When Meta released its AI, it made the technology freely available,
largely the opposite of what Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft have done.
Mark Zuckerberg has become the highest-profile technology executive to
support and promote the open-source model for AI. While other
companies are using a closed strategy to guard their technology,
Zuckerberg believes that the technology is so important and the
opportunities are so great that it should be made widely available so
that everyone can benefit. The decision to open source Meta's AI tech
was well-received and made Zuckerberg a lot more popular in tech
circles. 

 A MYOPIA EPIDEMIC IS SWEEPING THE GLOBE. HERE'S HOW TO STOP IT (17
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Studies from around the world are finding an increased rate of
incidences of pathologically stretched eyeballs among children
compared with pre-pandemic levels. The pandemic saw real-life
classrooms and playgrounds give way to virtual meetings and digital
devices, increasing the time that children spend focusing on screens
and other nearby objects significantly. This shift has caused their
eyeballs to lengthen to accommodate short-vision tasks. An hour of
extra outdoor break time every day can markedly reduce the incidence
of short-sightedness.

 THE FUTURE OF FOUNDATION MODELS IS CLOSED-SOURCE (14 MINUTE READ)

security - closed-source models will create far more economic and
consumer value over the next decade.
