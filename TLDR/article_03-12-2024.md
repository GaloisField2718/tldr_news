 12-POUND US ROBOT BALLOONS CAPTURE NYC-SIZED AREAS IN JAW-DROPPING
DETAILS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Near Space Labs has launched a fleet of balloon robots to monitor and
assess disaster-prone areas in the US. The balloons carry AI-powered
robots called Swifts. These robots form a network to capture detailed
aerial images. The image resolution is expected to rival or exceed
traditional aerial surveys conducted by planes or helicopters at lower
altitudes. They will be able to map large disaster zones in detail
within hours rather than weeks and help insurance companies, urban
planners, and government agencies assess properties and perform risk
evaluations.

 TESLA CEO ELON MUSK LOSES BID TO GET $56 BILLION PAY PACKAGE
REINSTATED (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A Delaware judge has upheld the ruling that Elon Musk's 2018 CEO pay
package of $56 billion was improperly granted. The ruling said that
Musk had individually controlled Tesla and dictated the terms of his
compensation to a board that didn't fairly negotiate. A $345 million
attorney fee award was approved for the lawyers who successfully sued
on behalf of Tesla shareholders. Despite the legal setback, Musk has
seen his net worth jump considerably in recent weeks - he is more than
$43 billion richer since the election.
