 THE MCP AUTHORIZATION PROBLEM, SOLVED WITH OAUTH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Model Context Protocol (MCP) [5] is becoming a standard for
connecting tools to LLMs. But how do you securely authorize MCP
servers?

OAuth now provides the answer, with five complementary specs for
delegation, token exchange, and scoped access.

The WorkOS advantage:

 	* Packages all 5 OAuth specs into one simple API. [6]
 	* Pre-built infrastructure that saves engineering time.
 	* Enterprise ready security out of the box.

Implement MCP Auth with WorkOS → [4]

 MICROSOFT NEARS OPENAI AGREEMENT FOR ONGOING TECH ACCESS (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Microsoft and OpenAI are in advanced talks over an agreement that
would remove a major obstacle to OpenAI's efforts to become a
for-profit enterprise. The new terms would let Microsoft use OpenAI's
latest technology even if the startup decides it has reached its goal
of building artificial general intelligence. The deal has still not
been finalized and could change. 

 SPACEX UNVEILS NEW VERSION OF MARS-BOUND STARSHIP (2 MINUTE READ) [8]


 A new iteration of SpaceX's Starship, V2, has been moved to Starbase
in Texas for preflight testing. V3 is expected to launch by the end of
this year. The Starship project is the only privately owned, fully
reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle under active development. If
successful, the spacecraft could drastically reduce the cost of
launching payloads to orbit and enable ambitious missions such as
NASA's Artemis lunar program and the eventual establishment of a human
colony on Mars.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 OVER-THE-AIR LASERS AIM TO SOLVE THE INTERNET'S “MIDDLE MILE” (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Startup Taara has a simple alternative to fiber-optic cables for
crossing cities and tough terrain: free-space optical lasers. Its
technology can reliably deliver 20-gigabit-per-second bandwidth across
distances up to 20 kilometers. The company is planning to create a
smaller version that can point, track, send, and receive signals at
tens of gigabits per second indoors at 60 meters, as well as outdoors
at 1 kilometer. Its biggest challenge is weather, but the technology
will usually work as long as the other side is visible. 

 A PILL FOR SLEEP APNEA COULD BE ON THE HORIZON (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Apnimed achieved positive results for its first oral pill for
treating sleep apnea in a Phase 3 clinical trial. The pill is taken
just before bedtime to help keep a person's airway open. It could be a
game-changer for those with sleep apnea - the current treatment
involves putting on a face mask connected to a Continuous Positive
Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine, which keeps airways open by forcing
air into them. The machines are effective, but they are noisy and can
be uncomfortable, so many end up abandoning them, leaving them feeling
exhausted, irritable, and unfocused during the day.

 THE 2025 DEVELOPER SURVEY (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Stack Overflow's 2025 Developer Survey received over 49,000 responses
from 177 countries across 62 questions focused on 314 different
technologies. The survey provides a snapshot into the needs of the
global developer community with a focus on the tools and technologies
they use or want to learn more about. Topics covered include cloud
platforms, AI agents, large language models, AI tools, and job
satisfaction. 

 CONTEXT ENGINEERING FOR AGENTS (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Context engineering is the art and science of providing agents with
just the right amount of information at each step of a task. It
involves providing the right instructions, knowledge, and tools to
optimize output while reducing token use. There are four common
approaches to context engineering: writing context (saving it outside
the context window to help an agent perform a task), selecting context
(pulling it into the context window to help an agent perform a task),
compressing context (retaining only the tokens required to perform a
task), and isolating context (splitting it up to help an agent perform
a task). Understanding and using these patterns is a central part of
building effective agents.

 AI IS WRECKING AN ALREADY FRAGILE JOB MARKET FOR COLLEGE GRADUATES
(15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A growing number of employers think that AI can do the work of a
22-year-old college graduate - some companies have stopped requesting
entry-level staff. As companies hire and train fewer young people,
they may also be shrinking the pool of workers that will be ready to
take on more responsibility in five to 10 years. Companies will have
to rethink how to develop the next generation of talent.
