 ZUCKERBERG LEADS AI RECRUITMENT BLITZ ARMED WITH $100 MILLION PAY
PACKAGES (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Mark Zuckerberg has personally reached out to hundreds of
researchers, scientists, infrastructure engineers, product stars, and
entrepreneurs to try to get them to join a new Superintelligence lab.
He is offering them hundreds of millions of dollars and in at least
one case discussed buying a startup outright. Despite the financial
incentives, some potential candidates have been hesitant to join Meta.
It is unclear how successful Zuckerberg's efforts will ultimately be -
OpenAI has given counteroffers to people Meta has tried to poach. 

 COURT FILINGS REVEAL OPENAI AND IO'S EARLY WORK ON AN AI DEVICE (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Legal filings submitted as part of a trademark dispute reveal details
about OpenAI and io's efforts to build a mass-market AI hardware
device. The companies have been vigorously researching in-ear hardware
devices. However, io's chief hardware officer said in court that the
prototype OpenAI CEO Sam Altman missioned in io's launch video was not
an in-ear device nor a wearable device. The design of the prototype
has not yet been finalized and the product is at least a year away
from being advertised or offered for sale.

 NEW YORK TO BUILD ONE OF FIRST U.S. NUCLEAR-POWER PLANTS IN
GENERATION (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 New York plans to build a large nuclear power facility to add at
least 1 gigawatt of energy, enough to power about a million homes. The
New York Power Authority will find a site in upstate New York and
determine the reactor's design. It may pursue the project alone or in
partnership with private entities. The US nuclear industry has
struggled for more than three decades to do much more than manage
existing plants because of safety concerns, huge cost overruns, and a
permitting process that moves at a glacial pace. This project could
help jump-start a new era of US nuclear reactor construction. 

 A PRIMER ON THE CURRENT STATE OF LONGEVITY RESEARCH (24 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 This post looks at the state of affairs in aging research. It offers
some basic background knowledge for each topic covered.
Longevity-focused research hasn't led to anything significant yet, but
the field is still very young. Scientific discovery works in strange
ways - research from longevity could end up impacting other fields,
leading to unexpected returns.

 PYTHON CAN RUN MOJO NOW (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Python can call Mojo code now. The setup is pretty simple - this post
walks through how to set it up and provides some examples of how to
use it. Development on the stack is still early, so it's not yet
production-ready. Mojo is a lot easier to learn than Rust while still
providing a meaningful function speedup.

room: China. 

 THE AI LIFESTYLE SUBSIDY IS GOING TO END (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Venture capital and zero-interest-rate policy supplied a ton of money
to startups, allowing them to grow even if they were selling customers
services at a loss. Today, investor money is going straight into
subsidizing the costs of AI products. AI products will likely soon
start showing ads to monetize. AI serves its users for now, but in the
near future, AI will serve ads.
