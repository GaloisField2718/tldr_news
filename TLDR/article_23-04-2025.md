 APPLE'S STARLINK UPDATE SPARKS HUGE EARNING OPPORTUNITY (SPONSOR) [4]


 Apple just added Starlink satellite support to iPhones through iOS
18.3.

One of the biggest potential winners? MODE MOBILE.

Mode's _EarnPhone_ already reaches +45M users that have earned over
$325M, and that's before global satellite coverage. With SpaceX
eliminating "dead zones" worldwide, Mode's earning technology can now
reach billions more in unbanked and rural populations worldwide.

Their global expansion is perfectly timed, and you still have a chance
to INVEST IN THEIR PRE-IPO OFFERING BEFORE THEIR SHARE PRICE CHANGES
NEXT WEEK [4].

Mode's recent 32,481% REVENUE GROWTH and their newly reserved Nasdaq
ticker $MODE puts them one step closer to a potential IPO.

INVEST AT $0.26/SHARE BEFORE THEIR SHARE PRICE CHANGES ON 5/1 [4].

 OPENAI WANTS TO BUY CHROME AND MAKE IT AN “AI-FIRST” EXPERIENCE
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 When asked if OpenAI would join in the bidding if Google had to sell
Chrome, OpenAI's head of product for ChatGPT Nick Turley said
unequivocally that the company would. OpenAI has reportedly been
considering building its own Chromium-based browser to compete with
Chrome. Having a browser would give OpenAI a massive install base of
users and the user data flowing through the browser would be
invaluable in training agentic AI models that can operate browsers on
users' behalf. There's a lot of discussion about who should buy
Chrome, but relatively little about spinning it off into an
independent company - despite Google's claims, the existence of its
multibillion-dollar search placement deals indicates the browser can
survive on its own. 

 MICROSOFT CRACKS DOWN ON LOW PERFORMERS WITH NEW EXIT STRATEGY: CHECK
DETAILS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft has rolled out stricter internal policies to reinforce its
performance management system. The new guidelines help managers
address underperformance more decisively while rewarding high
achievers more clearly. Changes include a tougher exit policy for
employees consistently rated in the lowest performance bracket and the
introduction of performance-related tools aimed at increasing
transparency and consistency in evaluations and rewards. Microsoft is
developing AI-powered training tools that simulate real-life feedback
scenarios to help improve confidence and communication during
performance discussions.

 A CHINESE-BORN CRYPTO TYCOON—OF ALL PEOPLE—CHANGED THE WAY I
THINK OF SPACE (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Earlier this month, an international crew of four private astronauts
took a journey into space aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. Chun
Wang, a Chinese-born cryptocurrency billionaire, paid SpaceX an
undisclosed sum for the mission to fly into orbit with three of his
friends. The mission was named Fram2 after the Norwegian exploration
ship Fram used for polar expeditions at the turn of the 20th century.
It orbited over Earth's pole for a perspective on the planet that no
human eyes had seen before. This article details what happened on the
mission - footage from the mission is available. 

 THE SECRETS OF LAB-GROWN CHOCOLATE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lab-grown chocolate could rival traditional chocolate in several
ways. The process can grow cells that multiply swiftly and mature
within a week, as opposed to the six to eight months usually required
for a conventional cocoa crop. The resulting product can also contain
higher levels of health-promoting chemicals and fewer contaminants
such as heavy metals or pesticides. The price of cocoa is skyrocketing
as the industry deals with drought and other problems.

 SIRI'S NEW BOSS IS ALREADY MAKING BIG INTERNAL CHANGES, PER REPORT (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Mike Rockwell recently took leadership over Siri at Apple, and it
seems like he isn't wasting any time in implementing major changes
internally within the Siri teams. The management team leading Siri's
development has been overhauled, with much of the leadership replaced
with lieutenants from the Vision Pro software group. Teams related to
speech, understanding, performance, and user experience have also been
restructured. It is clear that Siri's new boss is taking decisive
action to right Siri's years of stagnation. 

 THE FUTURE OF COMPUTE: NVIDIA'S CROWN IS SLIPPING (30 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Nvidia has become the fastest-scaling hardware company in history,
and with an immediate lack of alternatives, it will continue to print
cash. However, the company's long-term durability may be affected by
hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta developing
competitive, highly-credible chip efforts. The sheer scale of compute
needs is driving an enormous shift towards distributed,
vertically-integrated, and co-optimized systems. This means that even
though Nvidia has the highest-performing GPUs, it can still lose.
