 APPLE INTELLIGENCE IS NOW AVAILABLE IN PUBLIC BETAS (1 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The recently released public betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and
macOS Sequoia 15.1 include Apple Intelligence features. Users looking
to access the betas will need to register on Apple's beta software
program site. Only iPhone 15 Pro phones and iPads and Macs with M1
chips or newer will be able to use Apple Intelligence. Apple plans to
release final versions of the operating systems in October. 

 OPENAI TO DECIDE WHICH BACKERS TO LET INTO $6.5 BILLION FUNDING (1
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI's latest fundraising round is nearing completion. Prospective
investors will find out on Friday whether they'll be part of the deal.
The $6.5 billion funding round is oversubscribed, with an excess of
demand in the billions of dollars. It is set to value OpenAI at $150
billion. Thrive Capital is rumored to be leading the round with a
check for $1.25 billion.

 PATENTS FOR SOFTWARE AND GENETIC CODE COULD BE REVIVED BY TWO BILLS
IN CONGRESS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider a pair of
bills that would effectively nullify the Supreme Court's rulings
against patents on broad software processes and human genes. Software
and Internet advocates have taken notice and are taking steps to
defend open source software against patent trolls. Regulators say the
bills are necessary for a number of emerging sectors to prevent the
stifling of innovation. Detractors say that the bills will be a huge
gift to patent trolls, tech firms that aggressively license patents,
and patent lawyers, but will be a loss for everyone else. 

 REAL-TIME LINUX IS OFFICIALLY PART OF THE KERNEL AFTER DECADES OF
DEBATE (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Real-time Linux, which enables high-end audio production and many
other applications, has been available via out-of-tree patches since
2005. It has now been merged into the official Linux kernel, making it
easier for developers to maintain real-time systems. Developers will
no longer have to tend to out-of-tree patches when developing
mission-critical systems. The update will likely have no impact on
most desktop Linux users.

 THE EMPIRE OF C++ STRIKES BACK WITH SAFE C++ BLUEPRINT (5 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The Safe C++ Extensions proposal, recently published by the C++
community, aims to address the challenge of ensuring that C++ code is
free of memory safety bugs. Private and public sector organizations
have been pushing programmers to write new applications and rewrite
old ones in memory safe languages over the past two years. The
majority of serious vulnerabilities in large codebases come from
memory safety flaws. The Safe C++ project adds new technology for
ensuring memory safety, preventing users from writing unsafe code. It
allows existing code to work as always and ensures stakeholders have
control for incrementally opting into safety. 

 PAYING DOWN TECH DEBT: FURTHER LEARNINGS (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Reducing tech debt can help developers get into 'the flow' - making
small changes can lead to making more substantial changes. It is also
a great way to learn a new codebase. Large-scale rewrites need
heavyweight support, and a lot of commitment is required. They require
everyone in the company to understand what needs to be done.

 TECH JOBS HAVE DRIED UP ‚Äî AND AREN'T COMING BACK SOON (11 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Once fought over by companies, tech talent is now competing for
scarce positions. The reversal of fortunes signals a reset in an
industry adjusting its labor needs. Job postings are down and industry
layoffs have continued this year. Companies are shifting their
strategies to focus on revenue-generating products and services,
pulling back on entry-level hires, cutting recruiting teams, and
shutting down projects and jobs that aren't huge moneymakers. 

 FORBES MARKETPLACE: THE PARASITE SEO COMPANY TRYING TO DEVOUR ITS
HOST (25 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Forbes ranks highly for many topics it has no authority on. Its
dominance on Google is due to a completely separate company called
Forbes Marketplace, which runs several sections of the Forbes website.
Forbes Marketplace is the single largest and most successful parasite
SEO program of all time, and it's just getting started. It likely has
plans to go after every affiliate category unless Google stops it.
