 WHAT IS THE TRUE COST OF ONE LINE OF CODE? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Technical debt can bankrupt software teams — of time, energy, and
ability to innovate.

What are the true causes of technical debt?

How much is it costing you?

Can it be overcome?

In this video [4], Prof. Rainer Koschke from the University of Bremen
and Paul Lambert from the Qt Group look at the causes of software
erosion [4] (AKA tech debt) - and what you can do about it.

Learn how to identify technical debt, understand its impact, and keep
your codebase sustainable.

 GEMINI 2.5 IS HERE, AND IT IS AN ABSOLUTE BEAST (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google has introduced an experimental version of Gemini 2.5 Pro,
which marks a sizable advancement in AI capabilities. The Gemini 2.5
models are designed to 'think' through problems, an approach that
improves accuracy and performance. Google aims to embed these
reasoning capabilities across all Gemini models to enable them to
tackle complex challenges and support sophisticated context-aware
agents. Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrates strong reasoning and coding
proficiencies, with leading scores on common coding, math, and science
benchmarks. 

 OPENAI CLAIMS BREAKTHROUGH IN IMAGE CREATION FOR CHATGPT (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has updated GPT-4o to generate more realistic images. GPT-4o
has now replaced DALL-E 3 as the default image generation model in
ChatGPT. The updated image generation abilities are now available to
ChatGPT Free, Plus, Team, and Pro users. OpenAI used a group of human
trainers, who labeled training data for the model, to improve the
model's abilities, enabling it to generate more accurately rendered
and useful images and follow human directions more closely. An example
image generated by the updated model is available in the article.

 BILL GATES-BACKED COMMONWEALTH FUSION SYSTEMS HITS KEY REACTOR
CONSTRUCTION MILESTONE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Commonwealth Fusion Systems has installed a key component of its
SPARC demonstration reactor called the cryostat base. The milestone
signifies a transition into a new stage of the project that involves
building the actual tokamak itself. SPARC is expected to come online
in 2027 - if it works as anticipated, it could be the first tokamak to
produce more power than it takes to run. Three other major pieces of
the tokamak will be installed simultaneously later this year or early
next year - it will take several months after that to ensure all of
the pieces work together as planned. 

 GOOGLE QUANTUM EXEC SAYS TECH IS ‘5 YEARS OUT FROM A REAL BREAKOUT'
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Julian Kelly, Google Quantum AI's director of hardware, says that the
technology is only five years away from running practical applications
that can't be calculated on modern computers. The technology will be
able to do cutting-edge physics and potentially generate new kinds of
data. Google's most advanced quantum computer has 105 qubits - experts
say 1 million or more qubits will be needed for useful applications.
Quantum technology has been in the spotlight recently as Google
announced a breakthrough in error correction and Microsoft revealed a
new quantum computing chip.

 OPEN SOURCE DEVS SAY AI CRAWLERS DOMINATE TRAFFIC, FORCING BLOCKS ON
ENTIRE COUNTRIES (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Aggressive AI web crawlers are increasingly overloading
community-maintained infrastructure, essentially causing persistent
distributed denial-of-service attacks on vital public resources. Some
open source projects now see as much as 97% of their traffic coming
from AI companies' bots. This is dramatically increasing bandwidth
costs and service instability and burdening maintainers. New defensive
tools have emerged to protect websites from unwanted AI crawlers as
prominent industry players have shown little incentive to adopt more
cooperative practices. 

 WHOSE CODE AM I RUNNING IN GITHUB ACTIONS? (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Somebody added malicious code to the tj-actions/changed-files GitHub
Action a week ago, making the compromised action leak secrets to build
logs. The attack was possible because it's common practice to refer to
tags in a GitHub Actions workflow - changing a tag can make an action
run different code the next time it runs. Specifying a git commit ID
instead creates a reference that will run the same code every time.
This post presents a script that enables you to check whether there
are any mutable references within your GitHub Actions workflows.

 4-DAY WORK-WEEK PILOT DUE IN TECH LAND BY EARLY SUMMER (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The 4 Day Week Foundation is urging tech businesses to sign up for a
six-month trial from June 30 in the UK. There will be a six-week
workshop and training that starts on May 22. Hundreds of British
companies have already shown that a four-day, 32-hour working week
with no loss of pay can be a win-win for workers and employers. The
results of the upcoming pilot will be reviewed by researchers at the
University of Sussex and Newcastle University. 

 REFLECTING ON WIKITOK (16 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 WikiTok is an infinite controlling Wikipedia built on Bun, React, and
TypeScript. The app was created using Claude through Cursor, which did
a vast majority of the work. The developer gave it the specs they
wanted and prompted away. This post details the lessons that the
developer learned while building the app and after it went viral.
