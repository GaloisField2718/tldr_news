 META IS ENDING ITS FACT-CHECKING PROGRAM IN FAVOR OF A 'COMMUNITY
NOTES' SYSTEM SIMILAR TO X'S (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced a series of major changes to
the company's moderation practices due to a shifting political and
social landscape and a desire to embrace free speech. The fact
checking program will be replaced with a community-driven system.
Content moderation policies that reduced the amount of political
content in user feeds will be undone. The election was a major
influence on Meta's decision - Zuckerberg has criticized governments
and legacy media for pushing more and more censorship.

 NUCLEAR STARTUP DEEP FISSION PLANS TO BURY MICRO-REACTORS TO POWER
DATA CENTERS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Deep Fission is a nuclear startup that wants to bury small nuclear
reactors underground. The depth will act as a substitute for the tons
of concrete required to safeguard aboveground reactors. The startup
plans to lower its reactors on cables down a 30-inch, one-mile-deep
borehole. Any maintenance will require hauling the reactor to the
surface, which would take about an hour or two. Deep Fission is
targeting between five to seven cents per kilowatt-hour, half of what
new nuclear power costs today in the US. It has yet to receive a
license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 

 BLUE GHOST LUNAR LANDER SCHEDULED TO LAUNCH ON JANUARY 15TH (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The last lander to successfully reach the surface of the Moon's
cratered Mare Crisium region was the Soviet Luna 24 probe in August
1976. SpaceX is preparing to launch two landers there on January 15.
Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost 1 lander will carry 10 NASA payloads to
the surface. It will collect data using tools designed to measure
various particulate compositions, thermal properties, and the
electromagnetic activity of both the Moon and the Earth. The other
lander, Resilience, is from Japanese spacecraft firm iSpace.

 GOOGLE HOME APIS ENTER PUBLIC DEVELOPER BETA ON ANDROID (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 There are three parts to Google's new Home APIs on Android: the
Device and Structure APIs provide a single unified interface to manage
and control both cloud-connected and Matter devices across Google Home
connected devices, the Commissioning API simplifies device setup, and
the Automation API empowers users with tools needed to create and
manage home automations directly in apps. All developers can now
access the Android version of the Home APIs and test their apps with
up to 100 users. iOS will get a public developer beta in the coming
months. 

 AGENTS (59 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Intelligent agents are considered by many to be the ultimate goal of
AI. AI has made it possible to develop intelligent autonomous agents
to act as assistants, co-workers, and coaches. The potential economic
value of these agents is enormous. This article provides an overview
of agents and the aspects that determine the capabilities of an agent
and discusses how to evaluate agents to catch failures. AI-powered
agents are still an emerging field with no established theoretical
frameworks for defining, developing, and evaluating them.

 0X01F - AI AND STARTUP MOATS (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A key requirement for building a business, securing a key role, or
investing in companies is to focus on things that stand the test of
time and hopefully improve at doing them at a rate faster than the
market. A good way to do this is to find a moat. This article attempts
to enumerate all of the possible moats that will still be relevant in
the age of AI. It splits them into dead moats, short-term moats,
strong moats, and uncertain moats. Businesses should evaluate their
moats, use and learn about AI, systematize, move quickly, make strong
decisions, and work on their ability to predict the future. 

 SILICON VALLEY IS SO DOMINANT AGAIN, ITS STARTUPS DEVOURED OVER HALF
OF ALL GLOBAL VC FUNDING IN 2024 (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Data repeatedly shows that the San Francisco Bay Area is still the
best place for venture-backed startups. Startups in the area received
$90 billion of VC investment in 2024, 57% of the global venture
funding spent last year. The area has a high density of everything,
from financiers to engineers, making it easier to build a startup
there. It is the home of Big Tech and offers the largest concentration
of skilled tech employees.
