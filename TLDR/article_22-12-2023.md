 APPLE DEVELOPS BREAKTHROUGH METHOD FOR RUNNING LLMS ON IPHONES (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple researchers have made a key breakthrough in deploying large
language models on Apple devices with limited memory by using an
innovative flash memory utilization technique. The method uses
windowing and row-column bundling to minimize data transfer and
maximize flash memory throughput. It allows AI models to run up to
five times faster on standard processors and up to 25 times faster on
graphics processors. The technology sets the stage for iPhones to run
complex AI assistants on-device. 

 GOOGLE MIGHT ALREADY BE REPLACING SOME AD SALES JOBS WITH AI (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google is restructuring its Ads business because of its new AI tools.
The tools remove the need for a lot of work, increasing ad revenue
profit margins. A growing number of advertisers are adopting Google's
AI tools, eliminating the need for employees who specialize in selling
ads for particular Google services. Details about the reorganization
are expected to be announced next month.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 MEET THE PHOLED THAT IS TRANSFORMING DISPLAYS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blue phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED) materials will soon become
commercially available. PHOLEDs are potentially 100% efficient and
don't generate heat. Red and green PHOLEDs have been around for a
while, but creating blue PHOLEDs has been a challenge. Blue PHOLEDs
will mean a more balanced pixel structure for displays, which could
result in higher-resolution displays in the future. A switch to blue
PHOLEDs will lead to an approximate 25% gain in efficiency and the
reduced heat generation should increase the lifetime of all
surrounding electronics. Samsung will most likely be the first company
to deploy PHOLEDs. 

 CANCER-FIGHTING CAR-T CELLS COULD BE MADE INSIDE BODY WITH VIRAL
INJECTION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CAR-T treatment involves removing T cells from a patient, engineering
them to target cancer cells, and reintroducing them to the patient's
body. It has yielded dramatic recoveries from advanced forms of some
blood cancers, but the technology is out of reach for many people due
to its cost and difficulty. A new study suggests that the treatment
can be administered through an injection of a virus that infects T
cells. There are plans to request authorization from the US FDA next
year to begin human trials of the technology.

 TINYZERO (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 tinyzero allows anyone to easily train AlphaZero-like agents in any
environment. AlphaZero is a program developed by DeepMind for
mastering games like chess, shogi, and go. 

 WAKU (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Waku is a minimal React framework that supports React Server
Components (RSCs). RSCs allow developers to render UI components on
the server, improving performance and enabling server-side features.
Waku provides a minimal API that allows for multiple feature
implementations to make it easier to build new features. While using
RSCs is optional, it is highly recommended for improved user and
developer experiences.

 MIDJOURNEY V6 IS HERE WITH IN-IMAGE TEXT AND COMPLETELY OVERHAULED
PROMPTING (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Midjourney V6 has been released in alpha. The update drastically
improves image quality and gives the model the ability to generate
legible text within images. It also comes with an entirely new
prompting method that is much more sensitive and much better at
understanding users. Users will likely have to relearn how to prompt
if they are accustomed to Midjourney V5 prompting. Examples of images
generated with the new model are available in the article.
