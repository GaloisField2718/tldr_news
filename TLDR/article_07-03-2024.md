 APPLE TERMINATES EPIC GAMES DEVELOPER ACCOUNT CALLING IT A
‚ÄòTHREAT‚Äô TO THE IOS ECOSYSTEM (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple has terminated Epic Games' developer account, a move Epic is
calling a serious violation of the EU's Digital Markets Act. Epic
claims that Apple is retaliating against it for speaking out. Apple
says that Epic's past actions suggest that it doesn't intend to follow
the rules, threatening the integrity of the iOS platform and the
security and privacy of its users. It has the contractual right to
terminate its agreement with Epic at any time. 

 BILL THAT COULD BAN TIKTOK IN THE U.S. GAINS MOMENTUM IN CONGRESS (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A new bi-partisan legislation may force ByteDance to divest TikTok or
risk having it banned in US app stores. The bill, dubbed the
Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications
Act, creates a process for identifying certain social media
applications under the control of foreign adversaries as national
security threats. Apps deemed a risk would be banned from online app
stores and web hosting services unless they sever ties with entities
under the control of foreign adversaries within 180 days of the
designation. There are concerns that TikTok could be used by the
Chinese government to access personal data from its users and show
them videos that could influence their views on particular issues.

 THE NEXT STARSHIP MISSION HAS A TENTATIVE LAUNCH DATE: MARCH 14 (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX has posted a link to watch Starship's third flight test on X.
The flight is scheduled for 7:30 am ET on March 14. SpaceX has yet to
receive its launch license from the FAA. The next test aims to achieve
nominal first-stage performance, Starship separation from the first
stage using 'hot staging', Starship reaching an orbital velocity and
engine shutdown, early-stage testing on in-space refueling technology,
and a controlled splashdown of Starship in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX
intends to launch Starship at least nine times this year. 

 COMPANY THAT PLANS TO BRING BACK THE MAMMOTH TAKES A KEY STEP (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Colossal, a company that plans to take extinct species and restore
them through the use of DNA editing and stem cells, has announced the
production of the first elephant stem cells. The process, which is a
part of the company's plan to revive the mammoth, turned out to be
extremely difficult. Colossal has released a draft manuscript
describing the process on a public repository. Besides being part of
the process to revive the mammoth, the techniques used to produce
these stem cells could also be used to conserve existing species.

 META IS BUILDING A GIANT AI MODEL TO POWER ITS ‚ÄòENTIRE VIDEO
ECOSYSTEM,‚Äô EXEC SAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Part of Meta's technology roadmap, which goes on to 2026, involves
developing an AI recommendation model to power both the company's
Reels short video service and more traditional, longer videos. The
company currently uses separate models for each of its products. The
new recommendation system will provide more engaging and relevant
content to users. Meta's massive stockpile of GPUs will be used to
help its broader generative AI efforts, including the development of
digital assistants and more sophisticated chat tools. 

 TO COMPLY WITH DMA, WHATSAPP AND MESSENGER WILL BECOME INTEROPERABLE
VIA SIGNAL PROTOCOL (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Meta plans to make WhatsApp and Messenger interoperable with
third-party messaging services as required by the Digital Markets Act.
Engaging with third-party chats will be an opt-in experience for
users. Third parties have been asked to use the Signal protocol, but
they will be allowed to use other protocols as long as they are able
to demonstrate that the protocol offers the same security guarantees
as Signal. Third parties that connect to Meta will be responsible for
hosting any files their client apps send to Meta's users. They will
need to sign an agreement with Meta before the company will enable
interoperability.
