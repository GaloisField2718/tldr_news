 APPLE TARGETING MARCH RELEASE FOR NEW WALL-MOUNTED SMART DISPLAY
PRODUCT (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple could be releasing its first Apple Intelligence-powered smart
home device as early as March. It is rumored to be developing a
wall-mounted display that resembles a traditional home security panel.
The display will serve as a command center for the home. It will be a
standalone device, but an iPhone will be required for some tasks,
including parts of the initial setup. Apple is also working on a
higher-end smart home product that features a robotic arm. 

 AMAZON READY TO USE ITS OWN AI CHIPS, REDUCE ITS DEPENDENCE ON NVIDIA
(5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Amazon is already testing its Trainium 2 chips with Anthropic,
Databricks, Deutsche Telekom, and Japan's Ricoh and Stockmark.
Developed by Annapurna Labs, an Austin-based chip startup that Amazon
acquired in early 2015, Trainum 2 is aimed at reducing Amazon's
reliance on market leader Nvidia. The biggest advantage of Amazon's
chips is that they use less power, which helps drive down costs.
Amazon avoids making direct comparisons of its chips and doesn't
submit its chips for independent performance benchmarks, but experts
are confident the company's claims of a 4x performance increase
between Trainum 1 and Trainium 2 are accurate.

 GROUNDBREAKING: 'SLEEPY WEED' SHOWN TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE SLEEP (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cannabinol, a lesser-known component of the cannabis plant, delivers
better quality and longer sleep. Cannabis folklore has suggested for
decades that aged cannabis makes consumers sleepy due to the build-up
of cannabinol, but this was only recently supported by scientific
evidence. Cannabinol increases total sleep time with a comparable
effect to zolpidem, or Ambien. It may be best suited for patients who
have trouble staying asleep or experience early morning awakening
insomnia because it has a delayed onset but enduring effects. 

 WHEN MUSCLES WORK OUT, THEY HELP NEURONS TO GROW, A NEW STUDY SHOWS
(7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 During exercise, muscles release a soup of biochemical signals called
myokines that helps neurons grow. A recent study found that the
repeated pulling on neurons during exercise helps them grow as much as
when they are exposed to myokines. This suggests that exercise could
be effective for treating nerve injuries.
