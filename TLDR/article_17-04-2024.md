 ALOHA UNLEASHED üåã (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ALOHA Unleashed by Google DeepMind is a new generation of AI-powered
robots with impressive dexterity. DeepMind recently released a series

objects. The videos are available in the link. 

 NEW CHARGING ALGORITHM COULD DOUBLE LIFE OF LI-ION BATTERIES (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A team of researchers from Berlin has developed a charging solution
that makes lithium-ion batteries last much longer than they do now. It
uses a pulsed current (PC) protocol that results in reduced mechanical
stress and cracking in graphite particles within batteries and
suppressed structural degradation in cathodes. Using PC charging can
double the service life of commercial lithium-ion batteries with an
80% capacity retention. High-frequency pulsing with square-wave
current produced the best results.

 A QUICK POST ON CHEN'S ALGORITHM (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A recent paper authored by Yilei Chen called 'Quantum Algorithms for
Lattice Problems' has roiled the cryptography research community. The
preprint, whose results are still being evaluated, claims a new
quantum algorithm that efficiently solves the 'shortest independent
vector problem' in lattices with specific parameters. If true, the
result could allow future quantum computers to break schemes that
depend on the hardness of specific instances of these problems. If the
result can be improved upon, it could render an entire generation of
'post-quantum' lattice-based schemes obsolete, forcing cryptographers
and the industry back to the drawing board.

 THE INVISIBLE SEAFARING INDUSTRY THAT KEEPS THE INTERNET AFLOAT (58
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A small number of ships maintain the subsea cables that carry 99% of
the world's data. Positioned in strategic locations around the planet,
these ships stand ready to sail out and fix faults as soon as they are
detected. This article tells the story of how these ships operate and
the problems they face. Cable industry professionals perform a
function vital to the world, which if done right, will continue to be
unaware of their service.
