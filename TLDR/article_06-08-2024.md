 GOOGLE LOSES ANTITRUST CASE OVER SEARCH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A federal judge has ruled that Google illegally held a monopoly in
search and text advertising. Google was found to have violated Section
2 of the Sherman Act, which outlaws monopolies. The ruling is the
first anti-monopoly decision against a tech company in decades. Google
plans to appeal the ruling. 

 CHROME'S MANIFEST V3, AND ITS CHANGES FOR AD BLOCKING, ARE COMING
REAL SOON (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Chrome is preparing to make Manifest V3 compulsory for extensions
that want to run on its platform. Some users recently reported seeing
warnings telling them that certain extensions may no longer be
supported. V2 extensions started being disabled in early June on the
Beta, Dev, and Canary update channels. Users will still be able to
manually re-enable V2 extensions for a short time.

 A PRIMER ON THE CURRENT STATE OF LONGEVITY RESEARCH (19 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 This article takes a look at how far the field of aging research has
progressed since 2021. Nothing particularly useful has come from
sirtuin-focused therapies and this is unlikely to change. The increase
in longevity-focused research institutions/grant programs/startups
hasn't led to much progress, but it's still very early. Cellar
reprogramming has shown promise in animal studies, but no therapies
have reached clinical trials yet. There's still a lot we don't know
about biological clocks - everyday consumers should probably avoid
getting their biological age tested. While epigenetic clocks seem to
be useful, their interpretation is a bit complicated. 

 PATH TO PRECISION: TARGETED CANCER DRUGS GO FROM TABLE TO TRIALS TO
BEDSIDE (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are now many targeted therapies and new techniques in the
pipeline for treating various types of cancer. This article looks at
the history of targeted cancer treatments to see how far the science
has come. It took many preclinical studies, genetic sequencing
advances, and other breakthroughs to get where we are now. The success
of current treatments would not have been possible without all of the
research legwork and basic science over the past few decades.

 HOW POSTGRES STORES DATA ON DISK (35 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Databases contain some immensely powerful and clever abstractions.
They aren't that complicated - most of the complexity in them comes
from edge cases, often around concurrency. This article looks at how
databases store data on disk, with a focus on PostgreSQL. It also
provides resources for further research. Understanding how databases
work is useful for fine-tuning performance and data recovery. 

 HOW I PROGRAM IN 2024 (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article shares a developer's perspective on how to program
durable things. The developer found that he ended up with much better
programs by giving up tests and versions. Building durably for lots of
people is hard - it's much better to focus on a core set of people and
features. Overuse of the same tools creates technical debt, making
programs unnecessarily complex, less durable, and harder to change
when the context shifts.

 COOKIE BANNERS SHOW EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG WITH THE EU (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Billions of dollars have been spent on cookie banner compliance just
to annoy users with no material improvement to their privacy. The EU
has no mechanism for self-correcting legislative failures. Europe
needs to rethink how it legislates tech as the amount of squandered
potential is tragic. Very little innovation is happening in Europe and
when it does, it's usually shipped to the US or elsewhere as soon as
it's ready to make a real impact on the world. 

 OPENAI TEMPERS EXPECTATIONS WITH LESS BOMBASTIC, GPT-5-LESS DEVDAY
THIS FALL (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI is changing the format of its DevDay conference to a series of
on-the-road developer engagement sessions. It won't be releasing its
next major flagship model during the event. The conference will focus
on educating developers about what's available in showcasing dev
community stories. The DevDay events will take place in San Francisco
on October 1, London on October 30, and Singapore on November 21.
Registration costs $450 - applications close on August 15.
