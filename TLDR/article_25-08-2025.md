 APPLE TO KICK OFF THREE-YEAR PLAN TO REINVENT ITS ICONIC IPHONE (14
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple will lay the foundation for a once-in-a-generation iPhone
overhaul at its next product launch event. The company has planned
three straight years of major iPhone redesigns. The plan starts with
the iPhone Air, a skinny new model that follows the MacBook Air laptop
strategy. Apple's first foldable iPhone will arrive in 2026. 2027 will
see the iPhone's 20th birthday and the introduction of a curved-glass
'iPhone 20'. 

 ELON MUSK TAKES AIM AT BILL GATES' MICROSOFT WITH NEW AI VENTURE
“MACROHARD” (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk's new software venture, Macrohard, is a purely AI software
company designed to generate hundreds of specialized coding and
generative AI agents that could one day simulate products from
companies like Microsoft entirely through artificial intelligence. The
company appears to be closely linked to xAI's Colossus 2 supercomputer
project in Memphis. Musk has confirmed plans to acquire millions of
Nvidia GPUs. Colossus is already one of the most powerful
supercomputer clusters in the world, and it is still being expanded.

 THE NEXT STARSHIP FLIGHT WILL TEST MUCH MORE THAN HARDWARE (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 SpaceX has planned for a controlled splashdown for Super Heavy in the
Gulf of Mexico and an Indian Ocean splashdown for Ship for the next
Starship test flight. The launch window for the flight opened on
August 24 at 7:30 PM, but the launch was scrubbed 30 minutes from the
planned liftoff to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground
systems. SpaceX has beach and road closures scheduled for Monday and
Tuesday all day, so it is highly likely it will reattempt a launch
very soon. 

 META'S NEW 2MM LASER DISPLAY COULD ENABLE TRUE AR GLASSES (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Meta researchers have found a new use for photonic integrated
circuits (PICs), chips that can receive, modulate, and direct light.
Their PICs can receive RGB light from laser light sources integrated
into a panel, process it, then shine light onto a liquid crystal on a
silicon panel for final display. The overall complex is just two
millimeters thick and has a dramatically better color gamut over
similar displays. These PICs are manufactured using a CMOS-compatible
process, which means they should be affordable to create at scale.

 HOW WE VIBE CODE AT A FAANG (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Always start with a technical design document, as this is where the
bulk of the work happens. Design review before launching into the
development effort, and backlog development and sprint planning. Use
Test Driven Development, and have a dev approval process before code
can get merged into main. Test in staging before pushing to
production. 

 EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT GOOD API DESIGN (23 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 APIs are public interfaces for communicating with a program. Most of
what modern software engineers do involves APIs. APIs are hard to
build because they're inflexible, but must be easy to adopt. This is a
guide on good API design that covers how to change APIs without
breaking userspace, how APIs are affected by products, authentication,
retries, safety, rate limiting, and much more.

 META TO UNVEIL HYPERNOVA SMART GLASSES WITH A DISPLAY, WRISTBAND AT
CONNECT NEXT MONTH (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Meta plans to launch its first consumer-ready glasses with a display
at its annual Connect conference next month. The company will also
launch a wristband that will allow users to control the glasses with
hand gestures. The glasses, which will feature a small digital display
in the right lens, are expected to cost about $800. They will be solid
in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, with which Meta has been in
partnership since 2021, when the two companies released the
first-generation Ray-Ban Stories. 

 COINBASE CEO EXPLAINS WHY HE FIRED ENGINEERS WHO DIDN'T TRY AI
IMMEDIATELY (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently fired engineers for not signing
up for and testing the AI assistants the company purchased licenses
for. The firings sent a clear message that AI isn't optional at the
company. Armstrong has since leaned even further into AI training. The
company hosts monthly meetings where teams that have mastered creative
ways to use AI share what they have learned.
