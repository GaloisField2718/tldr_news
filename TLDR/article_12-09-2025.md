 MICROSOFT, OPENAI TRUCE CLEARS HURDLE IN PATH TO FOR-PROFIT
CONVERSION (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Microsoft and OpenAI have reached a deal to extend their partnership.
The agreement could ease OpenAI's path toward changes into a
for-profit corporation. The companies have not disclosed the terms of
the new contract but said that the current agreement was nonbinding.
The agreement is a tentative win for OpenAI, which needed Microsoft's
approval for its non-profit plan before it could be formally shared
with state regulators. OpenAI told its venture-capital investors it
would complete the restructure by the end of the year or risk losing
out on $19 billion in funding. 

 SAMSUNG TAKING MARKET SHARE FROM APPLE IN U.S. AS FOLDABLE PHONES
GAIN MOMENTUM (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Shipments from Samsung surged in the US in the second quarter while
Apple's market share declined. Apple remains on top of the US
smartphone market, but it is experiencing turbulence for the first
time in well over a decade. Samsung's Galaxy and Z phone lineup has a
massive span of devices that stretches from $650 up to $2,400,
targeting customers at every single price point. Apple may release a
folding phone next year - trying out new form factors offers Apple the
opportunity to sell devices at higher prices.

 EARLY EXPERIMENTS SHOW FAST-ACTING ANTIDOTE TARGETS CARBON MONOXIDE
POISONING (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A newly engineered protein therapy called RcoM-HBD-CCC has been shown
to cling to carbon monoxide and expel the poison via the kidneys
within minutes when given intravenously to mice. The protein quickly
sponges up the toxin without binding to nitric oxide, a gas molecule
that plays a key role in relaxing blood vessels. The protein was shown
to cling to carbon monoxide in human blood in test tubes. It is
unknown how the treatment will work in human bodies until it is
tested, but human trials are still likely to be a few years away. 

 REALITY IS RUINING THE HUMANOID ROBOT HYPE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are still many issues, such as battery life, reliability, and
safety, that need to be solved before humanoid robots can scale.
However, before that, it is important to consider whether it is worth
the trouble to make a bipedal robot. We already have reliable,
efficient, and cost-effective robots, just without legs. Safe and
reliable humanoid robots have the potential to revolutionize the
market at some point in the future, but it might not be worth the
effort.

 A/B TESTING CAN'T KEEP UP WITH AI (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Evals are still a new practice for many product teams. A/B testing is
no longer sufficient for AI product optimization because it's
expensive to create variants. AI eliminates this constraint - it is
now possible to have unlimited variants that automatically update
periodically based on real-user feedback. The companies that evolve to
think in evals will build products that improve faster than their
competitors can run in a single A/B test. 

 HASHED SORTING IS TYPICALLY FASTER THAN HASH TABLES (18 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 The two standard approaches for counting the unique values in a large
array of mostly-unique uint64s are to insert into a hash table and
return the number of entries, or to sort the array, then count
positions that differ from their predecessor. Sorting is typically
faster than hash tables in a well-tuned implementation. This problem
and its variants are the inner loop of some of the world's biggest CPU
workloads. This article takes a look at why sorting wins, when one
should choose hash tables versus a sort, and why it matters.

 GOOGLE CHROME AT 17 - A HISTORY OF OUR BROWSER (72 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google launched Chrome in the fall of 2008. The project has grown
from a secret skunkworks into a browser used by billions. Chrome turns
17 this week. This post walks through Chrome's origins and evolution
across speed, security, stability, and simplicity, and highlights key
milestones. The journey has been one driven by relentless performance
improvements, cutting-edge security efforts, and an uncompromising
focus on user experience. 

 FRONT-LOADED VESTING: WHY YOUR TECH OFFER LOOKS DIFFERENT NOW (10
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The even equity vesting schedule is quickly becoming a thing of the
past. Many companies are now shifting to front-loaded vesting. This
shift is a philosophical pivot toward a more dynamic,
performance-driven compensation strategy. Top performing employees
stand to benefit, while others will have more uncertainty of
compensation in subsequent years.
