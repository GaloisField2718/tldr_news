Reddit, and OpenAI also offer conversational AI search capabilities.

NEW ZEALAND (2 MINUTE READ) [5]

THE US (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Virginia may become the site of the world's first grid-scale nuclear

is a startup that plans to make a multibillion-dollar investment into
building the facility near Richmond. The plant will be able to produce
enough energy to power 150,000 homes. The path forward for the project

 I'M LOVIN' IT: EXPLOITING MCDONALD'S APIS TO HIJACK DELIVERIES AND
ORDER FOOD FOR A PENNY (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Flaws in the API for the McDonald's McDelivery system in India
enabled several exploits such as the ability to order any number of
menu items for ₹1, the ability to retrieve the details of any order,
the ability to view admin KPI reports, and more. This article covers
how these flaws were discovered and how they could be exploited. It
looks at the technologies that the fast food company uses and explains
how to secure them against attacks. McDonald's India has a bug bounty
(McDonald's USA doesn't) - the researcher was rewarded a $240 Amazon
gift card.

 THE GHOSTS IN THE MACHINE (40 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Spotify is rumored to be filling its most popular playlists with
stock music attributed to pseudonymous musicians, or 'ghost' or 'fake'
artists, presumably to reduce royalty payouts. The company might be
making the tracks itself. Playlists created by the company are
becoming crucial sources of revenue for independent artists and
labels. Spotify denies claims that it is creating its own fake-artist
tracks. This article looks at these ghost artists and the evidence
pointing to Spotify's role in them.

attached JoyCons rather than the slide-on controls in the original
Switch. They say they will release pictures of their console on
Christmas Day. Nintendo may be revealing the device as early as
January.
