 ADOBE GIVES UP ON $20 BILLION ACQUISITION OF FIGMA (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Adobe has abandoned its acquisition of product design software
company Figma as there was no clear path for regulatory approval for
the deal. Both UK and EU competition regulators have probed the deal
due to the impact it would have on the product design, image editing,
and illustration markets. Adobe will pay Figma $1 billion as a
termination fee as per the terms of the merger agreement. 

 APPLE WATCHES BEING PULLED FROM STORES THIS WEEK DUE TO POTENTIAL
IMPORT BAN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is pausing sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch
Ultra 2 starting on December 21. The products are facing a potential
import ban until August 2028 as a ruling found that they infringe on
patents from Masimo. The case is now under a Presidential Review
Period after which the devices will be subject to an import ban if the
ruling isn't vetoed. Apple is pursuing a range of legal and technical
options to ensure that the Apple Watch remains available.

 HOW CRISPR GENE EDITING COULD HELP TREAT ALZHEIMER‚ÄôS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 CRISPR therapies could potentially provide a one-and-done solution
for forms of Alzheimer's disease caused by genetic mutations. There
are several proposed strategies for using the technology to fight
Alzheimer's, but CRISPR-based gene therapies still have a long way to
go. Scientists are now laying the groundwork to start bringing CRISPR
technologies to clinical trials. Transformative treatments are likely
only a few years away, although they will be expensive. 

 SCIENTISTS CONTACT WHALES IN WORLD-FIRST COMMUNICATION EXPERIMENT (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists from UC Davis, the Alaska Whale Foundation, and SETI
teamed up to have a 20-minute conversation with a humpback whale in
her own language. The scientists played a contact call to the whale,
who responded each time closely matching the intervals, indicating
that the whale was engaged in an intentional exchange. The interaction
had elements analogous to how we may one day be contacted by
extraterrestrial beings. The scientists hope to replicate the work
with other intelligent animals.

 ZILLA (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Zilla is a multi-protocol, event-native proxy. It securely interfaces
web apps, IoT clients, and microservices to Apache Kafka via
declaratively defined, stateless APIs. Zilla has no external
dependencies and does not rely on the Kafka Consumer/Producer API or
Kafka Connect. It natively supports the Kafka wire protocol and uses
advanced protocol mediation to establish stateless API entry points
into Kafka. 

 CODAPI-JS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 codapi-js produces interactive code examples that can be embedded
directly into product documentation, an online course, or a blog post.
It automatically converts static code examples into mini-playgrounds
that are lightweight and easy to integrate. codapi-js can create
sandboxes for any programming language, database, or software. Most
playgrounds require a Codapi server, but the JavaScript and Fetch
playgrounds are able to work completely in the browser.

 OPENAI BUFFS SAFETY TEAM AND GIVES BOARD VETO POWER ON RISKY AI (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI has announced a new safety advisory group that will sit above
the technical teams and make recommendations to leadership as part of
an expansion of its internal safety processes to fend off the threat
of harmful AI. The company has updated its Preparedness Framework to
show a clear path for identifying, analyzing, and deciding what to do
about catastrophic risks inherent to models they are developing.
Leadership will be able to make decisions on whether to ship products,
but the board has the power to reverse those decisions. 

 JEFF BEZOS WANTS ELON MUSK TO KNOW BLUE ORIGIN IS SERIOUS NOW (5
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article discusses a recent podcast that Jeff Bezos appeared in
that focused on his leadership style and space company, Blue Origin.
Bezos has made it clear that Blue Origin needs to speed things up. He
has reconfigured leadership at the company and New Shepard is
scheduled for its next launch as soon as December 18. Blue Origin
predicts that its New Glenn rocket will launch next year with a NASA
smallsat mission. New Glenn will pose a challenge to SpaceX as it will
be used for cargo rather than for space tourism like New Shepard.
