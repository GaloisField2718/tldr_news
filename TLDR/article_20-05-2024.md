 BEST BUY IS THE UNLIKELY PLACE TO LOOK FOR HOME RUN INVESTMENTS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 The big-box retailer has a proven record of placing early bets on
home-tech products that go on to dominate the market.

	* Ring - acquired by Amazon for $1.2B
	* Nest - acquired by Google for $3.2B

Early investors in these companies are sitting on some serious returns
- but for the rest of us, there's still a chance to get in on the
action with RYSE [4].

History tends to repeat itself, and RYSE's launch +100 Best Buys
points towards their company being the next home run [4].

Their Smart Shade tech is poised to dominate an industry growing at
50% annually, and there's still time to invest in their $1.50/share
public offering.

 APPLE NEEDS TO EVOLVE TO COMPETE IN THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ERA
(12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is unveiling new generative AI features at its Worldwide
Developers Conference on June 10. While the company will still rely on
the on-device approach, it's also planning to deliver services via the
cloud. Apple will improve Siri's voice capabilities and add features
like auto-summarizing notifications to help users with their
day-to-day lives. Apple's generative AI technology isn't advanced
enough for it to release its own chatbot, so it's teaming up with
OpenAI to add the functionality to iOS 18. 

 BLUE ORIGIN SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHES ITS FIRST CREWED MISSION SINCE 2022
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Blue Origin has resumed crewed flights for the first time in two
years. The company recently successfully brought six tourist crew
members to the edge of space and back on its New Shepard rocket and
crew capsule. Blue Origin had paused launches after a mission
experienced an anomaly that caused it to abort after liftoff in August
2022. The company has flown a total number of 37 human passengers to
space so far.

 TRIAL HIV VACCINE TRIGGERS ELUSIVE AND ESSENTIAL ANTIBODIES, POINTING
THE WAY TOWARD A SUCCESSFUL VACCINE (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Duke Human Vaccine Institute has developed an HIV vaccine
candidate that triggers low levels of a type of broadly neutralizing
HIV antibodies within weeks. It targets an area of the HIV-1 outer
envelope that remains stable even as the virus mutates. Antibodies
against this region can block infection by many different circulating
strains of HIV. More work still needs to be done to create a more
robust response - a successful HIV vaccine will likely have at least
three components all aimed at distinct regions of the virus. 

 FROZEN HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE WAS SUCCESSFULLY REVIVED FOR THE FIRST TIME
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists from China have found a way to thaw human brain tissue
without damaging it. The scientists grew brain organoids from human
embryonic stem cells and then tested various chemical compounds to
determine which combinations could help keep frozen human brain tissue
alive and enable growth after thawing. The most successful combination
consisted of methylcellulose, ethylene glycol, DMSO, and Y27632. The
researchers suspect it somehow interferes with a pathway that would
otherwise initiate cell death, allowing for the issue to freeze and be
thawed without incident.

 üëã GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. But getting that kind of coverage ‚Äî and staying there ‚Äî
is hard and pricey for any sized team.

QA Wolf [9]takes testing off your plate:

‚úÖ Get to 80% test coverage in just 4 months.

‚úÖ Stay bug-free with 24-hour maintenance [9] and on-demand test
creation.

‚úÖ Get unlimited parallel test runs [9]

 SYSTEM TESTS HAVE FAILED (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 System tests are supposed to offer greater confidence that a machine
is working as it ought to. Developers automate testing to get quick
feedback on changes, to catch regressions, and to become confident
that a system works. System testing isn't the best way to fulfill all
of these goals - sometimes it's better to embrace the human element
and drop the automation. Not only will this allow you to know that the
system works, it also lets you know whether the user interface 'feels
right'. 

 HOW GOOGLE DOES CODE REVIEW (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article walks readers through Google's code review process. It
covers Google's internal code review tools, the different levels of
mandatory approvals, Google's culture around code review, and more.
Google's code reviews are more thorough and thoughtful than industry
standard. Changes take multiple days and countless rounds of feedback
before they can be merged.

 GROUP CHATS RULE THE WORLD (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Most of the interesting conversations in tech now happen in private
group chats. This thread looks at what makes a group chat good. The
best groups are small, have good moderators, and share rituals, jokes,
and routines. New ideas, combined with a sense of humor, is what makes
great group chats work - boredom breaks them. 

 MICROSOFT PLANS BOLDEST GAMES BET SINCE ACTIVISION DEAL, CHANGING HOW
‚ÄòCALL OF DUTY' IS SOLD (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Microsoft is releasing the next Call of Duty to its Game Pass
subscription service. Players will still have the option to purchase
the game outright. While this plan may mean people could end up paying
Microsoft less to play the new game, the company hopes that it will
draw new users to Game Pass who will end up paying more over the long
term. Starfield, which was released on Game Pass at launch last year,
drove a record number of new subscriptions in a single day.
