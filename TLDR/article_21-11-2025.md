 ANDROID QUICK SHARE NOW WORKS WITH AIRDROP ON IPHONE, STARTING ON
PIXEL 10 (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Android's Quick Share now works with Apple's AirDrop system. Apple
devices will now appear in the Quick Share interface on Android, and
Android devices will appear on macOS devices. The two-way sharing
works for photos, videos, and other files. The connection is direct
and peer-to-peer - data is never routed through a server, and shared
content is never logged.

 BLUE ORIGIN REVEALED SOME MASSIVELY COOL PLANS FOR ITS NEW GLENN
ROCKET (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blue Origin has revealed a roadmap for upgrades to its New Glenn
booster that includes more main engines and a super-heavy lift
capability. The upgrades are designed to increase payload performance
and launch cadence while enhancing reliability. They will be phased in
over time, starting with the third launch of New Glenn, which will
likely be in the first half of 2026. A list of the planned
modifications is available in the article. 

 GLASS, NOT ICE (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cryopreservation is a technology that brings tissue into a temporary
glassy state to pause biological time so that patients can have more
time. It is used in IVF and to help people recover from chemotherapy
through hematopoietic stem cell transplants. The technology uses
controlled-rate freezers, perfusion systems, novel cryoprotectants,
and rewarming devices to preserve complex biological systems. The
field is aiming for whole-body medical hibernation, but there are many
fundamental questions that must be answered before we can start
heading toward that goal.

 TINKERING WITH PROMPTS CAN ONLY GET YOU SO FAR. (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Most companies get stuck tinkering with prompts and wonder why their
agents fail to deliver dependable results. This guide from You.com [9]
breaks down the evolution of agent management, revealing the five
stages for building a successful AI agent and why most organizations
haven't gotten there yet. 

If you're ready to go beyond the prompt, this is the playbook for
you.  [9]

 HL (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 hl is a high-performance log viewer and processor that transforms
logs in JSON and logfmt formats into a human-readable output. It
enables quick parsing and analysis of large log files with minimal
overhead. hl features automatic pager integration, field-based
filtering, level filtering, time-stamp range filtering, field
visibility control, and more. It currently doesn't provide a built-in
pager - users are recommended to install 'less'. 

 HOW TO WRITE A GREAT AGENTS.MD: LESSONS FROM OVER 2,500 REPOSITORIES
(12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 GitHub's agents.md feature allows developers to create agents with
custom instructions. agents.md is where developers define all of the
specifics, provide code style examples, and set clear boundaries of
what not to do. Most agent files fail because they're too vague. The
best files provide agents with a clear job or persona, exact commands
to run, well-defined boundaries to follow, and clear examples of good
output for the agent to follow.

 FROM NETWORK EFFECTS TO COGNITIVE EFFECTS: THE NEW RULES FOR PLATFORM
DOMINANCE (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Cognitive design stitches memory, intuition, and prediction into
something that feels like a partnership. The best companies design for
anticipation. Mastering this balance results in products that feel
simultaneously reliable and almost alive. The future belongs to
companies that understand their users deeply and produce products that
already know what customers need.
