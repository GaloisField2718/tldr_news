 APPLE'S SIRI CHIEF CALLS AI DELAYS UGLY AND EMBARRASSING, PROMISES
FIXES (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Robby Walker, the executive overseeing Apple's Siri revamp, said that
the delays to key features have been ugly and embarrassing and that
the decision to publicly promote the technology before it was ready
made matters worse. It is unknown when the enhancements will actually
launch, but they aren't expected until next year at the earliest.
These features were a key selling point of the iPhone 16 line, which
otherwise lacked major changes. Apple reportedly doesn't plan to
immediately fire any top executives over the AI crisis, but the
company is poised to make management adjustments. 

 SPACEX CAPSULE DOCKS AS ASTRONAUTS PREPARE RETURN AFTER NINE MONTHS
(5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were only supposed to
be on the International Space Station for eight days, will begin their
journey back to Earth later this week. A SpaceX capsule carrying a new
crew has docked at the ISS. There will be a two-day handover period
after which the old crew will begin their journey - there could be a
small further delay due to weather conditions. The astronauts have
consistently said that they have been happy to be on board the space
station.

 ATHENA LANDED IN A DARK CRATER WHERE THE TEMPERATURE WAS MINUS 280°
F (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Intuitive Machines' Athena spacecraft's altimeter failed during
landing last week, causing it to misjudge its altitude and land in a
small shadowed crater after toppling over and rotating once or twice.
This caused regolith to be blown up into the solar panels, which meant
the panels weren't able to provide the lander sufficient power to
survive. The lander was able to accomplish some of its objectives as
mission operators decided to operate as robustly as possible for 13
hours to get as much data as they could. Despite the bad landing, the
mission was largely a success - Athena flew smoothly, the company
validated the spacecraft's methane-based propulsion system, and it
also proved that its communications technology can be used as part of
the lunar data relay network that NASA has contracted with Intuitive
Machines to develop. 

 TERN AI'S LOW-COST GPS ALTERNATIVE ACTUALLY WORKS (5 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Tern AI is building a low cost GPS alternative that can locate the
position of a vehicle using only map information and the vehicle's
existing sensor data. The system can localize vehicles in parking
garages, tunnels, and on mountains, something GPS struggles to do. It
is safer from a privacy perspective - with GPS, anyone can find you at
any time if they know your ID. Tern has not publicized how its
technology works.

 IN S3 SIMPLICITY IS TABLE STAKES (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The past year has seen some really interesting feature launches for
S3 that remove limits and make S3 simpler. A lot of work has gone into
the properties that make S3 simple - the S3 team considers themselves
successful only when these things can be taken for granted as that
means they aren't distractions. All of the most popular features on S3
have been in direct response to requests from S3 customers - this
article looks at how the S3 team has evolved its product in response
to the huge range of things that builders do today while keeping it
simple so that developers can work with data and not have to think
about anything else. 

 HOW I'VE RUN MAJOR PROJECTS (24 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Excellent project management is an extremely high-leverage skill -
organizing a ton of moving parts with complex, non-obvious
interdependencies and hard schedule constraints is a huge job and can
save weeks of delays if done right. Project management requires
focused time for organization. A detailed plan for victory is
important because whether or not the plan is being achieved is the
best way to figure out how well or badly things are going. Getting
complete information can often be the hardest part of the project.
It's important to overcommunicate so everyone knows what else is going
on to make correct decisions. Delegate when the project gets too big -
sometimes it's impossible to track every detail by yourself.

 Y COMBINATOR STARTUPS ARE FASTEST GROWING, MOST PROFITABLE IN FUND
HISTORY BECAUSE OF AI (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The latest cohort of Y Combinator startups is growing significantly
faster than past cohorts - and with actual revenue. The entire batch
in aggregate grew 10% per week over the last nine months. Y Combinator
CEO Garry Tan attributes the growth spurt to leaps in artificial
intelligence. AI's ability to subsidize an otherwise heavy workload
has allowed these companies to build with fewer people. 95% of the
code was written by AI for about a quarter of the current Y Combinator
startups. While there's a ton of hype, the startups are actually
getting commercial validation. 

 THE GOOD TIMES IN TECH ARE OVER (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Being a software engineer has been a lot of fun for most of the last
decade, with good job opportunities and plenty of perks for working in
tech. That has changed in the last two years. A lot of software
engineers are refusing to change - there is going to be a personal
cost to anyone not going along with the vibe shift, particularly for
more junior or more vulnerable engineers. Companies are now trying to
focus, so funding and resources are more focused on a handful of bets
that company executives actually care about. The silver lining is that
the industry is now more realistic and value is easier to understand.
