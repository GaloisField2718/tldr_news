 APPLE'S SPATIAL PERSONAS FOR THE VISION PRO BRING YOUR FACETIME
CALLERS INTO THE ROOM (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Apple Vision Pro's new Spatial Personas feature creates floating
animated portraits in users' session spaces, using AI to sync the
avatar to match users' head, mouth, and hand movements. It uses
real-time movement tracking to create a more personal sensation of the
other user being in the room. 2D tiles are still the default. The
feature works with up to five users on a FaceTime call. Spatial
Personas is still in beta. 

 TESLA SHARES FALL AFTER DELIVERIES DROP 8.5% FROM A YEAR AGO (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla reported a drop in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter.
Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla.
The numbers for the quarter fell far below even the most bearish of
analysts' expectations. Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first
quarter. The company has scheduled an earnings call on April 23 to
discuss quarterly results.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 BLINK TO GENERATE POWER FOR SMART CONTACT LENSES (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A team from the University of Utah has developed an all-in-one hybrid
energy-generation unit designed specifically for eye-based tech. The
device combines a flexible silicon solar cell with a device that
converts electrolytes within tears into energy. It can reliably supply
enough electricity to operate smart contacts and other ocular devices.
The system is an exciting development in the realm of smart contact
lenses as the field has been held back by a lack of a sustainable
power source. 

 NEW BRAIN CAP LETS PEOPLE PLAY VIDEO GAMES WITH THEIR MINDS (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Researchers have created a wearable brain-computer interface (BCI)
that allows wearers to play games using their minds. The cap can be
used without extensive calibration or the invasive surgical procedures
required by other BCIs. It has been tested on healthy people with no
motor impairments who were able to use it to control robots within
minutes. The technology has yet to be proven on people with
disabilities.

optimized for Apple Silicon. It features batched decoding for higher
throughput, distilled models for faster decoding, and quantized models
for faster memory movement. Lightning Whisper MLX is 10 times faster
than Whisper CPP and four times faster than the current MLX Whisper
implementation.

 GOOGLE TO FIGHT COOKIE HIJACKING WITH ENCRYPTION KEYS FOR CHROME
BROWSER (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Malware can hijack login sessions by accessing browser cookies.
Google is trying to mitigate this threat with a new system called
Device Bound Session Credentials, which uses encryption to prevent
hijacking attempts. It will develop the system openly on GitHub as a
public coding project. There is already a prototype of the system
running as an experiment for some users on Chrome Beta. Google plans
to kick off more trials of the system with website developers and
users by the end of the year. 

 CALIFORNIA INTRODUCES 'RIGHT TO DISCONNECT' BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW
EMPLOYEES TO POSSIBLY RELAX (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A new 'right to disconnect' proposition introduced in California, if
passed, would make employers in California lay out exactly what a
person's hours are and ensure that they aren't required to respond to
work-related communications while off the clock. There are exceptions
for emergencies and salaried employees may have periods in which they
may have to work longer hours. Companies would be fined a minimum of
$100 for wrongdoing. It is unclear how much support exists for the
bill, which follows similar legislation in other countries.
