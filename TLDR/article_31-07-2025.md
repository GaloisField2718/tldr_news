 TIKTOK INTRODUCES COMMUNITY NOTES IN THE FORM OF FOOTNOTES, A NEW
FACT-CHECKING TOOL (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TikTok's Footnotes is officially rolling out in the US for users in
the pilot program. There are around 80,000 users contributing to
TikTok's version of Community Notes - all of them have had active
TikTok accounts for at least six months, live in the US, haven't had
community guidelines violations in the past six months, and are at
least 18 years old. Footnotes will be moderated with a combination of
automated moderation and human moderation. Users can report footnotes
they think are untrue or break TikTok's rules. 

 TESLA TAKES FIRST STEP IN SUNSETTING MODEL S AND X WITH DRASTIC MOVE
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla could be sunsetting the Model S and Model X as it has ended
international orders. The two oldest cars in the company's lineup, the
vehicles account for a very small portion of overall sales. Tesla
doesn't make enough of the Model S or Model X units to justify the
expensive logistics process of shipping custom orders overseas. It is
possible the company may build a bunch of random configurations, send
them overseas every few months, and let them sell before replenishing
inventory.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE SCIENCE BEHIND REGROWING MISSING TEETH (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Clinical trials for a drug that could eventually help people regrow
missing or damaged teeth have begun in Japan. While humans typically
grow two sets of teeth in their lifetime, the buds necessary to grow a
third set still exist. The drug blocks a protein that limits tooth
growth. The researchers hope to roll the drug out to the wider public
by 2030. 

 HELION BREAKS GROUND ON WHAT COULD BE THE WORLD'S FIRST FUSION PLANT
DESPITE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Helion Energy has started site work on its commercial fusion power
plant. The company's first facility is scheduled to start operating in
2028. It is building a 50 megawatt reactor to power Microsoft's data
centers in the region. The entire tech sector is scrambling for new
clean energy sources to power the servers that support artificial
intelligence. Helion has spent 12 years on research and development
and building prototypes in preparation for this deployment.

 FAST (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Fast software changes behavior. Fast eliminates cognitive friction
and signals simplicity, which is rare in the world where code and
content are commodities. Making software fast often requires stripping
away non-essential features - the ultimate expression of respect in a
world obsessed with adding rather than refining. It means the
developer has thought deeply about what matters and eliminated
everything else. 

 CHOOSE BORING TECHNOLOGY, REVISITED (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Choose novel technology when trying to learn something new and use
boring technology when trying to solve a problem. Boring technologies
have known failure modes, well-understood capabilities, and proven
operational reliability. The advent of large language models and agent
AI coding tools has made this principle even more critical. Developers
who use technologies unknown to them have no way of verifying whether
AI is leading them down the wrong path.

 PERSONAL SUPERINTELLIGENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Mark Zuckerberg says that the development of superintelligence is now
in sight. He is extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help
humans accelerate their pace of progress and begin a new era of
personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve
the world in the directions they choose. Meta's vision is to bring
personal superintelligence to everyone to help them achieve goals,
create what they want to see in the world, experience any adventure,
and grow to become the person they aspire to be. It believes that the
benefits of superintelligence should be shared with the world as
broadly as possible. 

 WHY I BELIEVE IN AGI (AGAIN) (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 ChatGPT now seems to understand what it reads. The use of reasoning
models shows that ChatGPT can be creative. It can summarize texts
extremely well, a robust measure of intelligence. AI products now pay
for AGI research, which means that AI has reached early stages of the
long-awaited self-improvement loop.
