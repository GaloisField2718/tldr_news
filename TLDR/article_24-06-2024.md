 OPENAI'S GPT-5 PUSHED BACK TO LATE 2025, BUT PROMISES PH.D.-LEVEL
ABILITIES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 GPT-5 will be significantly more intelligent than GPT-4. It is still
at least a year and a half from release. The model will have advanced
memory and reasoning capabilities and Ph.D.-level intelligence in
specific tasks. A short video of OpenAI's Chief Technology Officer
Mira Murati comparing the different GPTs is available in the article. 

 TIKTOK CONFIRMS IT OFFERED US GOVERNMENT A 'KILL SWITCH' (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 TikTok offered the US government the power to shut the platform down
in 2022 in an attempt to address lawmakers' data protection and
national security concerns. It suggested a mechanism that would have
allowed the government to suspend the platform in the US if it did not
follow certain rules such as properly funding its data protection
units and making sure that ByteDance did not have access to US users'
data. The US government refused to engage in serious settlement talks
after 2022. It ignored requests to meet for further negotiations and
did not respond to TikTok's invitation for it to visit and inspect its
Dedicated Transparency Center in Maryland.

 RADIOACTIVE DRUGS STRIKE CANCER WITH PRECISION (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Radiation therapy has come a long way since X-ray therapy was born in
1896. Targeted radiopharmaceuticals helped the field achieve a new
level of molecular precision. These agents deliver their radioactive
payloads directly at tumor sites. While there are only a handful of
these therapies commercially available for patients, the number is
poised to grow as major players in the biopharmaceutical industry
start to invest heavily in the technology. 

 NASA INDEFINITELY DELAYS RETURN OF STARLINER TO REVIEW PROPULSION
DATA (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 NASA has adjusted the date of the Starliner spacecraft's return to
Earth to an unspecified time in July. The spacecraft was originally
due to undock and return to Earth on June 14, but return opportunities
have been waved off as more time is needed to review the data from the
vehicle's problematic flight to the International Space Station. There
were five separate leaks in the helium system that pressurizes
Starliner's propulsion system and five of the vehicle's 28
reaction-control system thrusters failed as Starliner approached the
station. NASA has not specified why it is not yet comfortable with
releasing Starliner to fly back to Earth.

 INSIDE NETFLIX'S BET ON ADVANCED VIDEO ENCODING (16 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Netflix's encoding team has enabled the company to deliver
better-looking streams over slower connections and has resulted in 50
percent bandwidth savings for 4K streams. It has contributed to
industry-wide efforts, including developing the AV1 video codec and
its eventual successor. The company is starting to move into more live
streaming, which will necessitate a completely different encoding
pipeline than what it uses for VOD. Its encoding team will have to
basically start all over to develop encoding that achieves the same
bandwidth requirements as VOD but in a faster, real-time way. 

 LLAMA.TTF (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 llama.ttf is a font file, large language model, and inference engine
for that model. Harfbuzz, a font shaping engine, has a Wasm shaper
that allows arbitrary code to be used to shape text. This code can be
anything - so llama.ttf uses an entire LLM inference engine with
trained parameters bundled inside. The result is a font that can
generate text locally in any Wasm-enabled Harfbuzz-based application.
A video demonstration is available.

 AI DOESN'T KILL JOBS? TELL THAT TO FREELANCERS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Freelance jobs that require basic writing, coding, or translation are
disappearing across job boards. The number of freelance jobs posted on
online platforms in the areas in which generative AI excels has
dropped by as much as 21% since the debut of ChatGPT and other
generative AI models. Some companies are returning to freelancers as
they are finding that AI-generated content isn't up to par - while
AI-generated material may look good to those in marketing, it often
reads as word salad to more knowledgeable people, especially on niche
topics. 

 THE MANAGER'S UNBEARABLE LACK OF ENDORPHINS (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Completing tasks and reaching goals feels good and makes you feel
competent. Most people don't get this feeling from managing people.
Management can be demoralizing due to the lack of measurable progress.
Contributions are often several levels, and often weeks/months,
removed from success events. This is the nature of management work.
