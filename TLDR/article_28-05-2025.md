MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is exploring ways for users to sign into third-party apps
using their ChatGPT accounts. ChatGPT currently has roughly 600
million monthly active users. Adding a 'Sign in with ChatGPT' feature
could help OpenAI compete with other massive technology companies that
help people with a range of online services. OpenAI appears to be
interested in integrating the sign-in service with a broad array of
companies. 

 APPLE IS READY TO REPLACE GAME CENTER WITH A MORE XBOX-LIKE GAMING
APP (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is expected to launch a gaming app alongside the next version
of iOS this September. The app will apparently replace Apple's Game
Center. It will feature editorial content and let users access games
available on the App Store. The app will work similarly to the Xbox
app for iPhone. The macOS version of the app will let users access
games from outside the App Store.

 SPACEX'S NINTH TEST FLIGHT OF STARSHIP LAUNCHES INTO SPACE, ENDS IN A
SPIN (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX's Starship successfully reached orbit last night, but it later
began spinning and made an uncontrolled re-entry into the Indian
Ocean. It was the smoothest Starship test of the year - the previous
two tests ended in explosions. Last night's launch was the first to
use a flight-proven Super Heavy booster. The booster had launched and
returned during Starship's seventh test flight. 

 WORLD'S FIRST THERAPY TO REVERSE SPINAL CORD INJURY ENTERS HUMAN
TRIAL (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The world's first regenerative cell therapy for treating spinal
injuries has been granted approval for a registrational Phase I
clinical trial. Chinese biotechnology company XellSmart's allogeneic
induced pluripotent stem cells regenerative therapy aims to repair
injuries and provide the foundation to regrow all the cells needed to
return function to the damaged region. It doesn't require harvesting
cells from a patient and is a 'one size fits all' treatment that will
work with anyone who has a spinal cord injury. If it passes through
the trial phases, the treatment will be easy to manufacture and scale
for broad access.

 JUST MAKE IT SCALE: AN AURORA DSQL STORY (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Amazon Aurora DSQL is a serverless, distributed relational database
service optimized for transactional workloads. The goal of its design
was to break up the database into bite-sized chunks with clear
interfaces and explicit contracts. Each component would do one thing
and do it well but work together to offer all of the features users
expect from a database. DSQL was written in Rust, which gave the team
the control they needed to avoid tail latency in the core parts of the
system, the flexibility to integrate with a C code base like Postgres,
and the high-level productivity the team needed to stand up its
control plane. 

 THE INGREDIENTS OF A PRODUCTIVE MONOREPO (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A monorepo is a powerful tool for institutional consistency. They are
used to enforce engineering culture and organization standards and
build a culture of code sharing. Achieving a productive monorepo is a
continuous process as organizations continue to scale and tools begin
to break, but it can be worth it if organizations are willing to
commit to it. This post looks at some of the tools needed to set up a
monorepo and discusses implementation strategies for them to paint a
clear picture of what it is like to walk the monorepo path.

 APPLE REJECTED ELON MUSK'S SATELLITE OFFER, NOW ITS PLANS ARE IN
JEOPARDY (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Elon Musk had approached Apple with an offer in 2022 after hearing
the company was planning to announce a satellite feature with the
iPhone 14. His offer was for SpaceX to provide exclusive satellite
connectivity to iPhones for 18 months if Apple would pay $5 billion
upfront. Musk had also threatened to announce his own satellite
feature that would work on iPhones if Apple couldn't come to terms
with SpaceX. Apple rejected the offer and Musk made good on his threat
- SpaceX announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite
services for users in areas with no reception. The company's satellite
efforts will likely remain very limited moving forward as it could
trigger the US government to regulate it as a telecommunications
carrier. 

 THE RECURRING CYCLE OF 'DEVELOPER REPLACEMENT' HYPE (6 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Shiny new technologies emerge every few years promising to make
software developers obsolete. However, what actually happens isn't
replacement, it's transformation. These technologies that promised to
eliminate the need for technical expertise ended up creating entirely
new specializations, often at higher salary points than before. The
same pattern is playing out in AI-assisted development. The most
valuable skill in software isn't writing code, it's architecting
systems, and that's one skill AI isn't close to replacing.
