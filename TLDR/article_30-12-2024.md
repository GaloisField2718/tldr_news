 GOOGLE CEO PICHAI TELLS EMPLOYEES TO GEAR UP FOR BIG 2025: ‘THE
STAKES ARE HIGH' (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google plans to introduce a number of AI features in the first half
of next year. The company recently held a strategy meeting for next
year where executives set the stage for a year of increased
competition, regulatory hurdles, and advancements in AI. CEO Sundar
Pichai has warned employees that 2025 will be a challenging year as
the company is facing scrutiny across the world. While Google's search
business still has dominant market share, generative AI has brought
with it a host of new competitors. 

 OPENAI SAYS IT NEEDS ‘MORE CAPITAL THAN WE'D IMAGINED' AS IT LAYS
OUT FOR-PROFIT PLAN (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI will create a public benefit corporation to oversee commercial
operations when it moves towards a for-profit structure in 2025. The
public benefit corporation will remove some of OpenAI's nonprofit
restrictions and allow it to function more like a high-growth startup.
The scale of capital that the company needs requires conventional
equity and a less complicated structure. OpenAI's effort to
restructure faces major hurdles, including a lawsuit from Elon Musk
and an outflow of high-level talent.

 THINKING SLOWLY: THE PARADOXICAL SLOWNESS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Humans think at a rate of 10 bits per second. Our bodies' sensory
systems gather environmental data at a rate of a billion bits per
second, 100 million times faster than our thought processes. It is
unknown why humans are only able to think a single thought at a time
rather than many at a time in parallel the way our sensory systems
work. One theory is that the brain was first evolved for navigation -
it would make sense that we can only follow one 'path' of thought at a
time if our brain evolved from a simple system to follow paths. 

 FROM NEW COMMERCIAL MOON LANDERS TO ASTEROID INVESTIGATIONS, EXPECT A
SLATE OF EXCITING SPACE MISSIONS IN 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Space exploration dazzled the world in 2024 - NASA's Europa Clipper
began its journey to study Jupiter's moon Europa, SpaceX's Starship
achieved its first successful landing, China's Chang'e 6 mission
successfully returned samples from the far side of the Moon, and the
International Space Station continued to host international crews and
private missions. Space agencies are gearing up for even more
ambitious goals in 2025. This article looks at the most exciting
missions planned for the coming year. These include CLPS, an
initiative from NASA to deliver science and technology payloads to the
Moon using commercial landers; SPHEREx, a mission that will survey the
sky in near-infrared light to create a comprehensive map of the
universe; Space Rider, and uncrewed spaceplane from the European Space
Agency; and Japan's M2/Resilience mission, which will launch a lander
and micro-rover to the lunar surface.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 SOFTWARE DESIGN IS KNOWLEDGE BUILDING (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Software designers usually have a simple concept in mind when writing
programs - understanding this concept allows them to find sections of
programs that must be altered when an update or correction is needed.
Changes made by people who don't understand the original design
concept almost always cause the structure of the program to degrade.
The changes will be inconsistent or invalidate the original concept.
After many such changes, nobody will understand the modified product.
Software that has been repeatedly modified in this way becomes very
expensive to update. 

 HOW I GOT PROMOTED TO STAFF ENGINEER TWICE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It's probably easier to get to staff engineer by getting hired as
doing so via promotions requires you to be known and valued by your
organization. Companies value engineers who ship, so ship projects
that the company cares about and don't spend time on pet projects.
Don't worry too much about mentoring and leading, as long as you're
leading projects successfully, or if doing so delivers value for the
company. Getting to staff manager requires a lot of work from your
manager - don't invest time in the promo packet until they're fully on
board.

 ALL DEVICES SOLD IN THE EU WILL NOW BE USB-C COMPATIBLE (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 All small and medium-sized portable electronic devices (under 100
watts) sold in the EU must now be compatible with USB-C ports. The
rule will also apply to laptops starting April 28, 2026. Apple removed
the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, and third-generation iPhone SE from its
EU online stores to comply with the regulation earlier this month.
Other major markets, such as California and India, are following the
EU's lead and will implement similar rules in the coming years. 

 BY DEFAULT, CAPITAL WILL MATTER MORE THAN EVER AFTER AGI (27 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 This article talks about the implications of labor-replacing AI and
the possible future that we might be facing. Labor is the human mental
and physical effort that produces something of value. Capital goods
are things that are used in the production of goods and services.
Capital can refer to both the stock of capital goods and the money
that can pay for them. AI will make capital a more general substitute
for labor. There will be less need to pay humans for work as you can
replace that with capital - data centers running software.
