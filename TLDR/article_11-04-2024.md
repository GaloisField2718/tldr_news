 ASTRANIS UNVEILS OMEGA ‚ÄòMICROGEO‚Äô SATELLITES FOR BEAMING
DEDICATED BROADBAND DOWN FROM HIGH ORBIT (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Astranis, a company that builds and operates relatively small
broadband satellites in high orbits, has unveiled a new generation of
communications satellites that will serve broadband to Earth from
geostationary orbit faster than any existing comsat. The new class of
satellites, called Omega, can provide 50 gigabits per second of
bandwidth each in both civilian and military bands. Astranis'
relatively smaller satellites make them harder to target, making the
infrastructure more resilient to attacks. The company plans to
complete its first Omega satellite in 2025 and launch as many as 24
per year to orbit starting in 2026.

using any dataframe library that uses the fsspec standard file system
interface library. fsspec, which is well used but not well known,

 GEMINI 1.5 AND GOOGLE‚ÄôS NATURE (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google claims to have the best infrastructure for AI. Its deep
investments into AI have helped customers train and serve cutting-edge
language models and put the company at the forefront of the AI
platform shift. This article looks at how Google's infrastructure
helps companies transform their operations and what that says about
Google's ability to compete. Google may have to shift to a different
business model, but its reliance on scale and overwhelming
infrastructure advantage won't change - because it's the company's
nature. 

 ALTERNATIVE BROWSERS REPORT UPLIFT AFTER EU‚ÄôS DMA CHOICE SCREEN
MANDATE (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A month since the Digital Markets Act came into application, there
are early signs that it is having an impact in stirring the
competitive pot and helping smaller browser makers gain share. The new
rules require internet gatekeepers to display browser choice screens
that point users to alternatives. It is still early days, but several
browser companies have shared positive stories of increased interest.
Many regional mobile users have yet to see a choice screen appear on
their devices as changes are still rolling out.
