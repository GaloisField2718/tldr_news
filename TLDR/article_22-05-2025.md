 JONY IVE TO LEAD OPENAI'S DESIGN WORK FOLLOWING $6.5B ACQUISITION OF
HIS COMPANY (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is acquiring Jony Ive's startup, io, in an all-equity deal
that values the startup at $6.5 billion. Ive and his design firm,
LoveFrom, which will continue to operate independently, will now lead
creative and design work at OpenAI. He could help OpenAI directly
compete with Apple in the consumer hardware space - Apple has
struggled to develop AI features that keep up with the latest
technology. io's staff of around 55 engineers, scientists,
researchers, physicists, and product development specialists will join
OpenAI. They will be tasked with developing AI-powered consumer
devices and other projects. 

 TESLA POSTS OPTIMUS' MOST IMPRESSIVE VIDEO DEMONSTRATION YET (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Tesla Optimus team's latest video demonstration shows the
humanoid robot performing a variety of tasks, including household
using a broom and vacuum cleaner, tearing a paper towel, stirring a
pot of food, opening a cabinet, closing a curtain, and picking up a
Model X fore link and placing it on a dolly. The robot completed all
these tasks through a single neural network. It learned its actions
using data from first-person videos of humans performing similar
tasks. The system could pave the way for Optimus to learn and refine
new skills quickly and reliably. The video is available in the
article.

 FOR ALGORITHMS, A LITTLE MEMORY OUTWEIGHS A LOT OF TIME (27 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Ryan Williams, a theoretical computer scientist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, recently posted a proof online on the
relationship between time and memory in computing. The proof, which
showed that memory was more powerful than computer scientists had
previously believed, established a mathematical procedure for
transforming any algorithm, no matter what it does, into a form that
uses much less space. It also implies there are calculations that
can't be computed in certain amounts of time, offering a new way to
attack one of the oldest open problems in computer science. 

 THE SMALL ROBOT COMPANY WITH BIG GLOBAL AMBITIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Robot.com is a Colombian robotic company with a fleet of over 500
robots working in warehouse logistics, advertising displays, security,
inspection, and deliveries. The company signed a multi-year
partnership with Amazon Web Services last year, catapulting it into
the big league of the global service robots market. The steady growth
of the company underscores the potential of the robotics industry in
Latin America, but it also highlights the challenges of regions with
high production costs, limited investor confidence, and minimal public
investment.

 PYTHON TOOLING AT SCALE: LLAMAINDEX'S MONOREPO OVERHAUL (8 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 LlamaIndex is an ecosystem consisting of more than 650 Python
packages, mostly Integrations and Packs. All of these packages share a
single GitHub repository, or monorepo. This article discusses
LlamaDev, a tool for managing monorepos at scale, and explains the
challenges with existing tooling. LlamaDev makes running tests faster
and easier, creates clearer logs so contributors know exactly what
happened if a check failed, and can be run locally for debugging.

 TESLA'S HEAD OF SELF-DRIVING ADMITS ‘LAGGING A COUPLE YEARS' BEHIND
WAYMO (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Tesla's head of AI and self-driving, Ashok Elluswamy, recently
admitted in an interview that the automaker's autonomous program is
lagging a couple of years behind Waymo's. However, Tesla's approach is
much cheaper, and its cost advantage will allow the company to scale
faster. Tesla produces over a million cars a year, versus Waymo's few
hundred units, and it plans to use the same vehicles for its
autonomous riding service. The company is still limited to a level 2
advanced driver system, which requires constant supervision from the
driver, while Waymo has been providing customers with level 4
autonomous driving rides for years. It plans to start offering level 4
autonomous rides to customers in Austin next month. 

 SERGEY BRIN POINTS TO WHERE GOOGLE GLASS FAILED — AND WHAT ANDROID
XR GETS RIGHT (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google is getting back into the smart glasses game. The company has
announced a partnership with Warby Parker - they plan to launch a
series of smart glasses built on top of Google's Android XR as soon as
next year. The rise of generative AI has allowed Google to revisit the
idea of Google Glass, a wearable it launched in 2013 that failed
partly due to a technology gap. The company has learned many lessons
since the failed launch. Other companies, like Meta and Apple, are
also reportedly working on smart glasses.
