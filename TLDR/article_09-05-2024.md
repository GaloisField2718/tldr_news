 JOHN TERNUS EMERGING AS THE MOST LIKELY SUCCESSOR TO TIM COOK AS
APPLE CEO (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has held the title since 2011, turns 64 this
year. While there is no reason to assume that a change at the helm is
imminent, there are multiple possibilities for who may eventually take
over. Apple's board will likely want someone who will stick around for
at least a decade. This makes 49-year-old John Ternus, Apple's Senior
Vice President of Hardware Engineering, the most likely successor. 

 TESLA QUIETLY TOOK DOWN ALL U.S. JOB POSTINGS AFTER WEEKS OF ELON
MUSK'S 'HARDCORE' LAYOFFS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tesla had 3,400 job postings across the US, Mexico, Canada, and
Puerto Rico on May 1, but it has since removed almost all of them. The
bulk of the positions were in California, Texas, and Nevada, where the
company has its gigafactories. This is the second time that Tesla has
almost entirely wiped out its job postings since it began laying off
workers on April 16. The company entered its fourth consecutive week
of layoffs this week. At least six high-profile executives have either
already resigned or plan to later this year.

 GOOGLE DEEPMIND'S NEW AI CAN MODEL DNA, RNA, AND ‚ÄòALL LIFE'S
MOLECULES' (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google DeepMind's AlphaFold 3 can predict the structure of all of
life's molecules. Previous versions of the model could only predict
the structures of proteins. AlphaFold 3 can model DNA, RNA, and
ligands. It shows a 50% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to
its previous models. DeepMind is making the AlphaFold Server research
platform, powered by AlphaFold 3, to some researchers for free for
academic and noncommercial use. 

 NEURALINK'S FIRST BRAIN-CHIP IMPLANT IN A HUMAN APPEARED FLAWLESS.
THERE WAS A PROBLEM (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Neuralink encountered a problem with the implant in its first human
patient that reduced the amount of data the device could capture from
his brain. Some of the implant's threads have come out. Neuralink has
not disclosed the reasons why the threads retracted unexpectedly.
Despite the implant's degraded capabilities, the patient is still able
to navigate around his computer screen and play games. Challenges with
the first test in a human patient were expected and the Neuralink team
remains optimistic that this problem can be solved.

 HOW CONTRIBUTING TO OPEN SOURCE HELPED YOU BECOME A BETTER DEVELOPER
OR LANDED YOU A JOB (LOBSTERS THREAD) [11] 

 This thread discusses the different ways open source work can help in
one's career. For those without certificates from higher education,
open source can work as a CV, demonstrating work to potential
employers. Contributing to open source can also widen your network and
help you find employment. Working with open source can help develop
the ability to jump into other people's codebases very quickly,
allowing you to become more efficient quickly. It also shows that you
can complete tasks/projects without anyone telling you exactly what to
do. 

 STACK OVERFLOW SUSPENDS USER FOR EDITING POSTS IN OPENAI PROTEST (5
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI and Stack Overflow's recent partnership announcement has
raised concerns for some users that their data is being used without
permission. Some users who wanted to delete their answers have had
their accounts suspended. The site does not generally allow the
deletion of posts if the questions have any answers. Stack Overflow
moderators say that it doesn't allow users to remove posts as they
hurt the company as a whole. While the GDPR gives users in the EU the
right to be forgotten, websites have a right not to delete data if it
doesn't contain identifiable information to prevent the flow of a
topic or question from being disrupted.

 GOOGLE EMPLOYEES QUESTION EXECS OVER ‚ÄòDECLINE IN MORALE' AFTER
BLOWOUT EARNINGS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google's business is growing at its fastest rate in two years, but
the performance isn't translating to higher pay for employees.
Employees questioned the company's plans to address a significant
decline in morale, increased distrust, and a disconnect between
leadership and the workforce during an all-hands meeting last week. At
the meeting, Sundar Pichai said that the company plans to continue
cutting expenses and driving efficiencies. While Google is growing its
expenses this year, it is moderating its pace of growth. Most
employees will receive a pay raise this year. 

 WHY IS EVERYONE SUDDENLY FURIOUS ABOUT AI REGULATION? (18 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 If California's Senate Bill 1047 passes, it will require the
companies behind the world's largest, most advanced AI models to take
steps to guarantee their safety before releasing the models to the
public. Despite being a piece of state legislation, the bill has
unusual international importance, as most of the companies making such
models are headquartered in the state. This article looks over the
bill and responds to some of the most serious misconceptions. It also
suggests concrete changes that address some of the real concerns.
