 NVIDIA LICENSES GROQ'S AI TECHNOLOGY AS DEMAND FOR CUTTING-EDGE CHIPS
GROWS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nvidia has signed a licensing deal with Groq for its AI-inferencing
technology. Groq, founded in 2016, makes chips and software to run AI
models. Its language processing unit chips are built for inference,
the process that AI models use to generate content. The company's
chips can be produced and deployed faster and use less power than
GPUs. 

 A FATHER, A SON, AND THEIR $108 BILLION PUSH FOR MEDIA MOGULDOM (11
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Larry and David Ellison bought Paramount this summer, and now they
are targeting Warner Bros. Discovery with a $108 billion hostile bid.
Larry Ellison personally guaranteed $40.4 billion for the offer. If
the deal works out, it could have enormous consequences for the news
and entertainment industries. This article takes a look at the Ellison
family, their past business dealings, and their relationship with each
other throughout the years.

 STARLINK PASSES 9 MILLION ACTIVE CUSTOMERS JUST WEEKS AFTER HITTING 8
MILLION (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX's Starlink satellite service has surpassed 9 million active
customers and is adding over 20,000 new users per day. Serving in over
155 countries, territories, and markets, the Starlink satellite
constellation now has more than 9,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites. The
growth rate reflects the rising demand for broadband in underserved
regions. SpaceX may be positioning itself for an initial public
offering as soon as next year, and Elon Musk has suggested in the past
that Starlink could have its own IPO in the future. 

 THE VIRTUAL CELL WILL BE MORE LIKE GWAS THAN ALPHAFOLD (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A virtual cell is a model that lets researchers model diseases and
treatments. Tied with the push for virtual cells are efforts to build
a foundational model, similar to AlphaFold. Researchers will need to
create their own datasets to answer specific questions to be
successful in the field. This will require models that have the
ability to explicitly identify, isolate, and subtract confounding
noise.

uses a single binary to drive a browser using AI, with zero setup. The

required. 

 PACKAGE MANAGERS KEEP USING GIT AS A DATABASE, IT NEVER WORKS OUT (9
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Git was designed to be a distributed collaboration tool for source
code. It wasn't designed to be used as a database for package
registries. Package managers who use git as an index all had to build
workarounds as they grew, causing pain for users and maintainers.
Package registries need fast point queries for metadata.

 RANDOM END OF YEAR SHOWER MUSINGS ON THE STATE OF THE STABLECOIN
ECONOMY AND ITS PARTICIPANTS (19 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Most new financial services companies will be built on stablecoin
rails in the next decade. Stablecoin rails unlock programmable money,
access to internet capital markets where genuinely new financial
primitives are being built every day, and the ability to let agents
manage funds with real guarantees. This is an opportunity to rethink
what financial services should actually look like. Most of the
industry is still running on the 2015 fintech playbook on new rails. 

 OPENAI HAS STARTED MOCKING UP WHAT ADS IN CHATGPT COULD LOOK LIKE (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI employees have reportedly started discussions on different
ways to prioritize sponsored information in ChatGPT. The company is
considering giving priority placement to sponsored results when users
are clearly talking about buying a product, showing ads based on user
information, or a sponsored sidebar that shows ads relevant to the
conversation. OpenAI is wary about turning off users, as they might
not trust a chatbot that injects ads into sensitive conversations. The
pressure to increase revenue is building on OpenAI, which signed a
flurry of massive deals this year that it will have to pay for.
