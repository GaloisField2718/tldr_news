 GOOGLE WILL NO LONGER BACK UP THE INTERNET: CACHED WEBPAGES ARE DEAD
(1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google is killing off its cached links feature. The company says that
the feature was designed as an alternative way to load websites when
people couldn't depend on a page loading, but technology has improved
to the point Google feels it can retire it. While users can currently
still create cache links manually, all of Google's support pages about
cached sites have been taken down. Deleting cache data will free up an
uncountable number of petabytes of data for Google, which is currently
in an era of cost savings. 

 THE FIRST REDDIT REVIEWS OF THE VISION PRO ARE IN (4 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Reddit's Vision Pro subreddit is filling up with experiences from
people who decided to take the plunge and spend $3,500 on a new
platform. The reviews are mixed, with some saying it's the best piece
of technology they've ever experienced while others express
disappointment over the device's limitations. The device is apparently
unable to play certain types of 3D movies. This thread contains some
of the reviews from the subreddits, with photos, videos, and
criticisms included.

 OBESITY DRUGS HAVE ANOTHER SUPERPOWER: TAMING INFLAMMATION (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The drugs classified as GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to
reduce inflammation in the liver, kidneys, heart, and brain. These
drugs include semaglutide and tirzepatide, which are marketed as
treatments for diabetes and obesity. This effect is leading scientists
to hope that they could be used to treat Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
diseases, which both involve brain inflammation. More than 20 clinical
trials are now exploring the drugs as therapies for the two
conditions. 

 ANTI-AGING PILL FOR SENIOR DOGS IS NOW IN CLINICAL TRIALS (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Biotech company Loyal has launched a study that will test a daily
anti-aging pill in senior dogs. The pill is designed to help dogs live
and stay healthy longer. Dogs must weigh at least 14 pounds, be at
least 10 years old, and live near one of 55 participating vet clinics
to enroll in the study. Loyal plans to enroll 1,000 senior dogs in the
study, which has already begun. A link for dog owners to sign their
pets up for the study is available in the article.

 INTRODUCING PKL, A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR CONFIGURATION (11 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Pkl is a programming language for producing configurations that are
declarative and simple to read and write. It features capabilities
borrowed from general-purpose languages like classes, functions,
conditionals, and loops. Pkl can build abstraction layers to meet many
different types of configuration needs. It can produce static
configuration files in any format or be embedded as a library into
another application runtime. Pkl code can be shared by creating
packages and publishing them. 

 THE PAIN POINTS OF BUILDING A COPILOT (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Companies everywhere are launching copilots, AI assistants that
leverage large language models to assist with tasks. This article
looks at the process of building these products, the pain points, and
the opportunities for AI tools. The information was gathered from
semi-structured interviews with developers from a variety of companies
that are working on copilots. It is still very early in the field of
product copilots and it will be interesting to see how software
engineering will evolve over the next several years.

 REMAKING THE APP STORE (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The iPhone proposed a new kind of tradeoff for the software industry
- it put security, privacy, and reliability over the freedom to change
anything and do anything. While this tradeoff is right for almost
everyone, Apple uses its control for selfish reasons that are not
about security, privacy, or reliability at all. The DMA appears to be
trying to stop gatekeepers from abusing their control over competitors
while also requiring them to control all sorts of other policy
objectives. Apple's response to the DMA suggests that nothing much
will change. 

 WHEN SHOULD YOU GIVE UP ON A PROJECT THAT DOESN'T WORK? (5 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 If you have an idea, you should test your hypothesis as soon as
possible. Being afraid that your hypothesis may be wrong can lead you
to spend time working on something that won't pay off. Early testing
can validate an idea - you will know straight away if something is
worth building. Procrastination can sometimes be a sign that you
subconsciously know a project isn't going to work out the way you
thought it would.
