 SPACEX COMPLETES SIXTH STARSHIP FLIGHT, SPLASHES DOWN BOTH BOOSTER
AND SPACECRAFT (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX launched the sixth Starship test flight yesterday near
Brownsville, Texas, before intentionally splashing down in the Indian
Ocean an hour later. The company had originally aimed to catch the
rocket's Super Heavy booster with its launch tower but decided to
splash down the booster in the Gulf of Mexico instead as it did not
clear the 'commit criteria' needed for the catch attempt. This was the
first time Starship made a daylight splashdown in the Indian Ocean.
Video of the flight test is available in the article.

 I'M A NEUROSCIENTIST WHO TAUGHT RATS TO DRIVE (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A study in which rats were taught how to drive found that rats housed
in enriched environments learned to drive faster than those in
standard cages. The finding supports the idea that complex
environments enhance neuroplasticity. The study found that the rats
had an intense motivation for their driving training. Its results
suggest that anticipating positive experiences may help drive
persistence to keep searching for life's rewards. Pictures and videos
of the rats and their automobiles are available in the article. 

 NEW FASTEST SUPERCOMPUTER WILL SIMULATE NUKE TESTING (2 MINUTE READ)

safety. It will also aid in fusion and AI projects. Planning for the
system began in 2018, with construction starting four years ago. El
Capitan was built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which has built all
of the current top 3 supercomputers.

 US GOVERNMENT COMMISSION PUSHES MANHATTAN PROJECT-STYLE AI INITIATIVE
(4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A US congressional commission has proposed a Manhattan Project-style
initiative to fund the development of AI systems that will be as smart
or smarter than humans. The Manhattan Project was a large-scale
collaboration between the US government and the private sector that
produced the first atomic bombs. The commission says that
public-private partnerships will be key in advancing artificial
general intelligence, but did not give any specific investment
strategies in its report. The commission also recommends repealing the
de minimis trade exemption that allows Chinese goods under $800 to
bypass tariffs with minimal paperwork and inspection.
