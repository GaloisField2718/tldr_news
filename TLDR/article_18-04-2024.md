a fraction of the size and weight that also looks like a product. It
has some impressive capabilities, like being able to stand up from a
lying face-down position. A short video of Atlas demonstrating the new

 TESLA ASKS SHAREHOLDERS TO APPROVE TEXAS MOVE AND RESTORE ELON MUSK'S
$56B PAY (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Tesla is asking shareholders to approve a move to Texas and to
re-approve a $55.8 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk that was
recently voided by a Delaware judge. The vote will be held at Tesla's
2024 annual meeting on June 13. Renegotiating a replacement
compensation plan that Musk would agree to would likely take
substantial time and incur new accounting charges of billions of
dollars. Musk has not been paid for any of his work over the last six
years at Tesla, where he helped generate significant growth and
stockholder value, with the company's stock up more than 630% since
March 2018.
