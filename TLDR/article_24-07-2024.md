 META RELEASES THE BIGGEST AND BEST OPEN-SOURCE AI MODEL YET (7 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Meta has released Llama 3.1, its biggest open-source AI model yet.
The company claims it outperforms GPT-4o and Anthropic's Claude 3.5
Sonnet on several benchmarks. The largest version has 405 billion
parameters and was trained with over 16,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. Meta is
making its AI assistant available in more countries and languages and
adding a feature that can generate images based on someone's likeness.


 APPLE'S FIRST FOLDABLE IPHONE COULD ARRIVE IN 2026 (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Apple's first foldable iPhone could arrive in 2026. It is rumored to
fold horizontally, similarly to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. The phone
is now in development with suppliers. Apple is still reportedly
working to flatten the crease that appears when the phone is unfolded.
Next year's iPhone is rumored to have a mechanical aperture that will
let users achieve a depth-of-field effect.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 IS CULTIVATED MEAT FOR REAL? (27 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While the cultivated meat industry is releasing increasingly
optimistic projections, well-informed commentators remain skeptical.
It is difficult to make cultivated meat at affordable prices and at a
large enough scale to compete with conventional animal products.
Cultivated meat is possible, but it will take decades and hundreds of
billions of dollars in investment. In the meantime, companies could
pursue cheaper products that combine cultivated meat and plant-based
components. 

 CHINESE RESEARCHERS CREATE FOUR-GRAM DRONE THAT MIGHT FLY FOREVER (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Chinese researchers have created a solar powered drone that weighs
just over four grams. It uses an electrostatic motor that weighs just
1.52 grams and is powered by solar cells that produce 4.5V. Its design
has a lift-to-power efficiency two to three times better than that
found in traditional drones. Adding batteries to the drone would make
it capable of 24-hour flying operations.

 SOFTWARE ENGINEERS ARE NOT (AND SHOULD NOT BE) TECHNICIANS (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Great software engineers automate repetitive/manual labor. Most large
software engineering organizations incentivize anti-automation due to
their desire for predictability. Predictable work is work that could
have been automated but was not automated. The more predictable and
routine a developer's job is, the more they tend to slide into
becoming a technician. Teams that get into predictable flows are
likely ignoring a promising opportunity for automation. 

 WHERE SHOULD VISUAL PROGRAMMING GO? (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 We shouldn't try to replace all code with visual programming but
instead only add graphics where it makes sense. Most visual
programming environments fail to get any usage because they try to
replace code syntax and business logic, which developers never try to
visualize. Developers visualize things like state transitions, memory
layouts, and network requests. Those working on visual programming
would be more likely to succeed if it started with aspects of software
that developers already visualize.

 INSIDE THE 78 MINUTES THAT TOOK DOWN MILLIONS OF WINDOWS MACHINES (5
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Businesses around the world experienced outages starting shortly
after midnight on Friday. This was caused by a faulty update to
CrowdStrike's Falcon security software, which is used widely in
Windows machines to prevent cyber threats. The update exposed a
massive flaw in the company's product that could have been easily
avoided. The issue could have been prevented if CrowdStrike had
properly tested its updates with a small group of users and rolled out
the update gradually, a fairly standard practice in the industry. 

 ASK HN: IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE FAANG SALARIES WITHOUT WORKING THERE?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [13] 

 The gap between FAANG and non-FAANG salaries can be quite
substantial. While it is possible to make FAANG-level salaries
elsewhere, these opportunities are usually in less well-known
companies that rarely hire. Most of these jobs also require some kind
of specialty. The finance industry pays well, but the job will likely
be more stressful. One other option is to learn how to build a
business rather than optimizing to being a well-paid employee.
