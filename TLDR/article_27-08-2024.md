 APPLE WORKING ON NEXT-GEN HUMANLIKE AI ‚ÄòPERSONALITY' THAT'S NOT
SIRI (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is reportedly developing an AI personality entirely separate
from Siri for future Apple robotics devices. The company's first
robotics projects are not expected to debut until 2026 or 2027. Apple
will ship a brand new Apple Intelligence-fused Siri in iOS 18.1 later
this fall. However, many of Siri's most powerful new capabilities
aren't scheduled to arrive until sometime in 2025.

 FOR HIS SECOND TRIP TO SPACE, BILLIONAIRE HAS GRANDER, RISKIER
ASPIRATIONS (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman is scheduled to head into
space for the second time later this week. The itinerary for the trip
includes the first ever spacewalk by private astronauts. The mission
will travel farther than anyone has traveled since the Apollo 17
mission went to the Moon in 1972. It will pass through regions of
intense radiation while testing new technologies and gathering data on
the effects space has on the human body. 

 HOW DO YOU 3D PRINT GLASS? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana are working to
adapt artisan glass-blowing techniques to a robotic platform. They
have developed a technique that uses a laser to heat the surface of a
glass rod so it can be deformed to create 3D shapes. It is able to
create the transparent solid structures needed in optical,
microfluidic, and photonic devices. The method can deposit glass at 15
cubic millimeters per second. A picture of the glass 3D printer is
available.

 FIXING A BUG IN GOOGLE CHROME AS A FIRST-TIME CONTRIBUTOR (19 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 This post presents an overview of the process of submitting a bug fix
to Chromium/Google Chrome from beginning to end. It aims to give some
perspective for developers looking to try it. The post covers how the
bug was discovered and fixed, testing and code review, and more. The
process can take a while and a good bit of effort, but it is a
valuable experience in seeing how software gets built at Chromium's
scale.

 'PRESSURE COOKER': WHY MILLIONAIRE NVIDIA EMPLOYEES ARE STILL WORKING
UNTIL 2 A.M. (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Many of Nvidia's employees are millionaires because of the company's
growth. Despite this, the company still has a 'pressure cooker'
culture with long working hours, yelling and fighting at meetings, and
company politics. Some employees work every day, including weekends,
late into the night. Employees who work less than the norm are called
out at company-wide meetings. The company maintains a low turnover
rate, likely due to the way it gives its employees access to stock
grants and its 'flat' hierarchy, which could make the company an
appealing choice. 

 WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOOT *YOU* UP? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google researchers recently published a paper detailing a scanning
process that can yield a geometric model of the brain's wiring at
nanometer resolution. Further development of the method could result
in technology that can scan a person's brain and recreate them far
into the future. However, the amount of data needed to store all of
the information from just one human brain is infeasible with current
technology. The biggest problem in digital immortality might not be
technical, but economical.
