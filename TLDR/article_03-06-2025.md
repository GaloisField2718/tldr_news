 🚀 FASTER MOBILE APP RELEASES WITH 100% PARALLEL AUTOMATED QA
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf [5] gets mobile apps to 80% automated test coverage in weeks
[6]. They create and maintain your test suite in Appium (no vendor
lock-in) — and provide unlimited, 100% parallel test runs [7] with
zero flakes.

✅ QA cycles reduced from hours to less than 15 minutes

✅ Tests run on real iOS devices and Android emulators

✅ Flake-free runs, no false positives

✅ Human-verified bug reports

No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No more bugs
reaching production.

 HOW MUCH SHOULD THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN GET PAID? (7 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Elon Musk was paid $0 last year for his role as Tesla's chief

package despite two votes of support from shareholders. The company is
now exploring a new compensation package for Musk. This article looks
at three possible approaches to paying Musk.

worldwide. The scientists are seeking clinical approval and practical
rollout of the universal artificial blood by 2030.

It breaks down the system prompt, the two user prompts, and the tool
calling prompts. The prompts from the post were obtained by setting a

 MY AI SKEPTIC FRIENDS ARE ALL NUTS (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Large language models can write a lot of the tedious code you'll ever
need to write and reduce the number of things you need to Google.
While there are many objections to using the technology, it is
undeniable that AI can speed up many workflows, even if it makes
mistakes sometimes. Developers have always been responsible for what's
in their code - AI doesn't change that. They still have to check code
for mistakes and to understand how it all works.

 OF COURSE WORKERS WANT A FOUR-DAY WEEK. COMPANIES SHOULD TOO (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Studies across hundreds of businesses and nonprofits switching to
four-day-week pilot programs show that working one day less every week
with no reduction in pay results in reduced burnout, better mental
health, and improvements in physical health. Organizations saw
excellent results in performance metrics such as revenue, absenteeism,
and resignations - less than 10% decided to discontinue the four-day
week. Companies appear to be able to maintain 100% of their
performance despite 20% less time at the workplace. The most common
productivity hack used by companies was to cut down on meetings.
