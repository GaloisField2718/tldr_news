 BUILD SECURE AI AGENTS WITHOUT COMPROMISING INNOVATION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI agents are reshaping digital experiences, but securing them
requires rethinking identity and access controls built for a
human-first world. That's why we built Auth0 for AI Agents [4], now
GA. 

Connect your AI agents to apps and data more securely, give users
control over the AI agents' actions and data access, and enable human
confirmation for critical agent actions. Auth0 for AI Agents is the
complete auth solution for building AI agents more securely.

 2026 MAY BE THE YEAR OF THE MEGA IPO (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 At least three of the most valuable and highest-profile tech
companies are currently preparing to list their shares on the public
market. Anthropic, OpenAI, and SpaceX have all taken early steps to go
public. Any of these companies would be among the most valuable ever
to go public. The listings could create an enormous bonanza for Wall
Street, which has seen a slump in IPOs since 2021. 

 MUSK SAYS TESLA IS MOVING FULL SELF-DRIVING TO A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla will stop selling its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software
for a flat rate and instead only offer it as a monthly subscription
after February 14. The feature will start at $99 per month. It was
previously priced at a one-time payment of $8,000. The technology
still requires a human driver at the wheel ready to steer or brake at
any time.

 ELON MUSK SURPRISES EVERYONE: SPACEX WILL ATTEMPT TO REACH MARS BY
THE END OF 2026 (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX has announced plans for a potential uncrewed mission to Mars
as early as late 2026. The proposed schedule coincides with a rare
planetary alignment between Earth and Mars that offers a narrow but
valuable launch opportunity. Several core technologies essential to
deep space travel remain in development. Starship Version 3 is
expected to debut this year. It will feature upgrades that may prove
pivotal to long-duration missions beyond Earth orbit. 

 GENETIC THERAPY AIMS TO BRING HEARING TO THOSE BORN DEAF (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 OTOF-related hearing loss results from a genetic change in a single
critical protein. The auditory nerve fails to receive the proper
signals from the hair cells in the ear due to the lack of the proper
protein, resulting in profound deafness. DB-OTO is a virus-based gene
therapy that can deliver a working version of the OTOF gene. It uses a
non-pathogenic virus to carry the proper genetic code that produces
the protein. In an early trial of the DB-OTO treatment, eleven out of
twelve patients developed improved hearing within weeks, and nine
patients no longer required cochlear implants.

 FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WORKING MORE, BUT GETTING LESS DONE? INSIDE THE
HIDDEN PRODUCTIVITY CRISIS (SPONSOR) [9] 

 55% of knowledge workers are putting in more hours but delivering
less. The culprit? Well over half say that fragmentation is a
productivity killer. Miro's 2025 Momentum at Work Report [9] lays out
the costs of tool sprawl and the solutions that get teams back on
track. Read the report [9] 

 SCALING LONG-RUNNING AUTONOMOUS CODING (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Model choice matters for extremely long-running tasks. GPT-5.2 models
perform better at extended autonomous work compared to Opus 4.5 and
GPT-5.1-codex. Many improvements come from removing complexity rather
than adding it. The best system is often simpler than you'd expect.
The harness and models matter, but the prompts matter more. 

 JUNIOR DEVELOPERS IN THE AGE OF AI (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The most compelling reason to hire juniors is AI itself. The biggest
barrier to AI transformation has been workforce buy-in. Gen Z leads in
AI adoption, and they act as an accelerant, helping colleagues learn
AI tools and workflows. AI has lowered the cost of onboarding. If the
infrastructure already exists, hiring juniors may be one of the
highest-leverage AI bets available today.

 2026: THIS IS AGI (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Long-horizon agents allow models to take actions and iterate over
time. The rate of progress in this area of research is exponential. It
is estimated that agents will be able to work reliably to complete
tasks comparably to human experts by 2028. People will soon be able to
hire agents - one of the litmus tests for AGI. 

 WHEN WILL THEY TAKE OUR JOBS? (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Humans will lose control over the future if AI capabilities continue
to advance. However, if we manage to avoid that, there's a good chance
humans will retain a lot of employment during the Cyborg Era, which
might last around 10 to 20 years. It is implausible that AI
capabilities and available compute continue to increase indefinitely.
This is a transitional state.
