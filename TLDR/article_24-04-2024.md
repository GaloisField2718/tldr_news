 TESLA TEASES ITS UPCOMING UBER-LIKE SELF-DRIVING RIDE-HAILING APP (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla teased screenshots of its ride-hailing feature along with the
release of its Q1 2024 financial results. The feature allows people to
summon self-driving Teslas for rides. Riders can adjust the
temperature and music inside the vehicle from their phones. The
feature will be integrated into the existing Tesla app. Tesla has yet
to achieve unsupervised self-driving, so it is unknown when the
ride-hailing feature will be available. The screenshots are available
in the article. 

 APPLE REPORTEDLY DEVELOPING ITS OWN CUSTOM SILICON FOR AI SERVERS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple reportedly has ambitious plans to design its own artificial
intelligence server processor using TSMC's 3nm node. TSMC's 3nm
technology is one of the most advanced semiconductor processes
available. A specialist AI server processor would allow Apple to
tailor hardware specifically to its software needs, potentially
leading to more powerful and efficient technologies. While Apple is
rumored to be prioritizing on-device processing for many of its
upcoming AI tools, some operations will inevitably have to occur in
the cloud.

 HERE'S WHY RISC-V IS SO IMPORTANT (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 RISC-V is an instruction set architecture freely available for
commercial purposes. The open source chip design is helping to drive
innovation in custom hardware. RISC-V competitors may eventually
emerge to challenge AMD and Intel. The combined resources working to
develop faster and more efficient RISC-V chips may one day outpace
that of major players in the CPU space. 

 IS UMAINE'S EXPERIMENTAL 3D-PRINTED DWELLING THE FUTURE OF AFFORDABLE
HOUSING? (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UMaine's experimental 3D-printed dwelling, BioHome3D, is the result
of a two-and-a-half-year effort to create a technology for building
homes faster, more efficiently, and less expensively than conventional
construction. BioHome3D is made from logging and sawmill wood waste.
It has an open-concept living/kitchen/dining room, one bedroom, and
one bath. The dwelling has two mini-split heat pumps and roughly 30
sensors that measure temperature, humidity, wind, and other weather
factors. Pictures of the dwelling are available in the article.

 LINUX CAN FINALLY RUN YOUR CAR'S SAFETY SYSTEMS AND DRIVER-ASSISTANCE
FEATURES (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Elektrobit's EB corbos Linux for Safety Applications is a new Linux
distro designed to comply with the automotive industry's functional
safety requirements. It was developed with Canonical, who will help
with keeping the system compliant with safety requirements over time.
The operating system uses an external safety monitor to intercept and
validate kernel actions. This allows its developers to keep up to
speed with the developer community. 

 HASHQUERY (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Hashquery is a framework for defining and querying BI models in data
warehouses. Its expressions are defined in Python, compiled into SQL,
and run directly against a data warehouse. It is capable of expressing
complex, multi-layered data queries. Hashquery natively integrates
with upstream semantic layers and can be used together with Hashboard
as a headless BI interface.

 WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE BUILT A NEW CITY? (32 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 California Forever announced plans in August 2023 to build a new city
of up to 400,000 people in Solano County, forty miles northeast of San
Francisco. The company purchased 50,000 acres of land for an estimated
$900 million in 2017. Most of the land is zoned for agricultural use
and is subject to slow-growth laws. This may change after a vote in
November. The project may be the most ambitious new development built
in California in over 50 years. This article features an interview
with Jan Sramek, the founder and CEO of California Forever, where he
discusses the project. 

 SENATE PASSES TIKTOK BAN BILL, SENDING IT TO PRESIDENT BIDEN'S DESK
(6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Senate has passed a bill for a foreign aid package that includes
a measure that will force China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok or have
it banned from the US. The bill will now head to President Joe Biden,
who has already committed to signing the legislation. Once signed into
law, ByteDance will have up to a year to complete a sale of TikTok.
Enforcement of the law may be delayed by legal challenges. The bill is
aimed at preventing foreign adversaries from conducting espionage,
surveillance, maligned operations, and otherwise harming vulnerable
Americans, rather than a punishment against ByteDance or any other
individual company.
