 STATE OF CODE SECURITY IN 2025 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your code might be more vulnerable than you think.

🔓 35% of GitHub repositories are public, exposing code to potential
attackers.
🔑 61% of organizations have leaked cloud secrets, like API keys and
access tokens.

In the new State of Code Security Report (2025) [4], the Wiz Threat
Research team analyzed hundreds of thousands of repositories to
uncover how attackers are exploiting modern development
practices—and how you can stop them.

Download the report [4] to discover the biggest security pitfalls and
get actionable steps to protect your organization.

 DEEPSEEK IS RUSHING TO GET ITS NEXT-GEN R2 MODEL OUT SOONER THAN
EXPECTED (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DeepSeek is looking to maintain the momentum gained by the debut of
its R1 reasoning model by rushing its new R2 model to market as
quickly as possible. It first planned to launch R2 in early May, but
it now wants to move the release date forward. The model will likely
have improved coding skills and be able to reason in languages other
than English. DeepSeek has a chance to shake up the market once again,
especially with GPT-4.5's arrival in a few weeks. 

 ANTHROPIC'S CLAUDE AI IS PLAYING POKÉMON ON TWITCH — SLOWLY (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Claude Plays Pokémon is a livestream on Twitch where Anthropic's
newest AI model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, plays a game of Pokémon Red.
Anthropic says Pokémon is a good benchmark for its model as it can
effectively 'think' through the sorts of puzzles the game contains.
The model has managed to win three gym leader badges. However, it has
run into several issues, such as being unable to navigate around a
wall and confusing other NPCs for Professor Oak inside his laboratory.

 WEDNESDAY'S STACKED SPACEX LAUNCH IS SENDING GROUNDBREAKING SCIENCE
TO THE MOON AND BEYOND (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket containing a lunar robot, lander, and
satellite, as well as a mission to an asteroid, is scheduled to blast
off today. The blastoff will ideally occur at 7:17 PM ET. NASA will be
livestreaming the launch on its website. This article contains links
to the livestream and details about each of the payloads. 

 IS IT LUNACY TO PUT A DATA CENTER ON THE MOON? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 One of the payloads on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launch today is an
Intuitive Machines mission that will stay on the surface of the moon
for approximately three weeks before returning to Earth. The lander
contains a mini data center belonging to Lonestar Data Holdings that
weighs just 1 kilogram and contains 8 terabytes of SSD storage.
Moon-based data centers would be protected from Earthly hazards such
as natural disasters, war, and other disruptions. They would also not
be subject to the laws of any nation, allowing them to accommodate a
diverse customer base. These data centers could be powered entirely
through solar and naturally cooled through the environment.

 GET CODING HELP FROM GEMINI CODE ASSIST — NOW FOR FREE (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Gemini Code Assist for individuals is a free version of Gemini Code
Assist that is now globally available in Visual Studio Code, GitHub,
and JetBrains' IDEs. Powered by Gemini 2.0, it supports all
programming languages in the public domain. Google is offering up to
180,000 free code completions per month on Gemini Code Assist. The
tool supports up to 128,000 input tokens in chat, allowing developers
to use large files and ground Gemini Code Assist with a broader
understanding of their codebases. 

 FAST COLUMNAR JSON DECODING WITH ARROW-RS (25 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A lot of data pipelines spend the bulk of their CPU time
deserializing JSON. If you want to build a fast stream processing
engine, you need to start with a fast JSON deserialization strategy.
This post is aimed at helping developers gain some intuition for how
to work with columnar data, something many engineers find challenging
and unfamiliar with in our typically row-oriented world. It covers
batched decoding, column building, streaming extensions, and more.

 AI PROMISE AND CHIP PRECARIOUSNESS (32 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 There is currently sufficient incentive for the leading research labs
to raise money and continue investing in new foundation models, even
as competition drives API prices down relentlessly. Getting to a
future where the US has a strong AI industry running on US-made chips
will take significant interventions in the market to undo the
overwhelming incentives for US companies to simply rely on TSMC. Such
a shift will take time, which is why making Taiwan indispensable to
China's technology industry is the price that needs to be paid in the
meantime. 

 THE DEEP RESEARCH PROBLEM (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While the examples of the work Deep Research can do OpenAI has
provided look great, there are several issues with the tool. It
appears the tool made intern-level mistakes when sourcing its data for
one of the examples. While these models are definitely getting better,
any model that generates mistakes can't be trusted. The best use cases
for tools like this so far are for tasks where the error rate doesn't
matter.

 ANTHROPIC'S LATEST FLAGSHIP AI MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY COSTLY
TO TRAIN (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Claude 3.7 Sonnet apparently cost just a few tens of millions of
dollars to train, not factoring in related expenses - a sign of how
relatively cheap it is becoming to release state-of-the-art models. 

 HOW CORE GIT DEVELOPERS CONFIGURE GIT (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This post looks at the settings in git defaults that even the core
developers change. 

 THERE ISN'T MUCH POINT TO HTTP/2 PAST THE LOAD BALANCER (5 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Handling HTTP/2 is better left to the infrastructure entry point,
typically the load balancer or reverse proxy, as they have to decrypt
and decompress the request to know what to do with it, so there is no
need to re-encrypt and re-compress it to forward to the app server. 

 HARD PROBLEMS THAT REDUCE TO DOCUMENT RANKING (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Some complex problems can be solved by transforming them into
document ranking problems, which large language models can be used
effectively for.
