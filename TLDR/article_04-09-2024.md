 NVIDIA GETS DOJ SUBPOENA IN ESCALATING ANTITRUST PROBE (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The US Department of Justice has sent subpoenas to Nvidia and other
companies seeking evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws.
Antitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to
switch to other suppliers and penalizing buyers that don't exclusively
use its artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia claims that its market
dominance stems from the quality of its products. The company
prioritizes customers who can make use of its products in ready-to-go
data centers as soon as they're provided to prevent stockpiling and to
speed up the broader adoption of AI. 

 RIP LCD: APPLE REPORTEDLY GOES ALL-OLED FOR NEW IPHONES (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Apple is reportedly putting OLED-based screens into all of its
iPhones in the iPhone 16 lineup. The company is no longer using
displays from Japanese suppliers and ramping up the use of OLEDs from
China and South Korea. OLED displays were previously only available in
the premium Pro and Pro Max models. The new phones, expected to be
announced on September 9, will also feature the introduction of new
Apple Intelligence AI features.

 SPACEX POLARIS DAWN MISSION SET TO LAUNCH EARLY FRIDAY (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 The SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission, set to feature the first-ever
spacewalk by private citizens, is now scheduled to launch on Friday
from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, with backup opportunities on
Saturday and Sunday. The mission aims to reach a peak altitude of 870
miles, the highest for any crewed mission in over half a century. The
crew will be wearing newly developed SpaceX extravehicular activity
suits on their spacewalk. The launch was delayed twice last week due
to technical issues and weather constraints. 

 NEW FORMS OF STEEL FOR STRONGER, LIGHTER CARS (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Automakers tweak production processes to create new steels that allow
them to build cars that are both safer and more fuel-efficient. Most
steel is more than 98 percent iron - it's the remaining amounts that
make the difference. Modifying treatment methods can also change the
metal's structure to yield different properties. This article looks at
some of these techniques and the materials that comprise modern
vehicles.

 ‚úÇÔ∏è CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES (SPONSOR) [14] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it ‚Äî you need to check out QA
Wolf.

QA Wolf's [14] AI-native approach gets engineering teams to 80%
automated end-to-end test coverage [14] and helps them ship 2x faster
by reducing QA cycles from hours to minutes.

The result? With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [15] achieved
4x more test cases and 86% faster QA cycles.

 QUICK GUIDE TO WEB TYPOGRAPHY FOR DEVELOPERS (18 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This guide covers key typography settings and teaches how to
manipulate them with CSS to make texts on apps and websites look good
by default. It is designed to help developers get good results without
diving headfirst into typography. The guide focuses on general
adjustments that make text good-looking and easy to read and the CSS
rules needed to achieve that. Experienced designers shouldn't be
afraid to break the rules, but developers should probably stick to
sensible defaults if they're not sure. 

 GREPPABILITY IS AN UNDERRATED CODE METRIC (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Making a codebase searchable can make functions, error messages,
class names, and other components easier to find. Splitting up
identifiers is a bad idea because while it looks nice, it makes it
easier to miss specific occurrences. Use the same names for things
across the stack, otherwise, you'll have to make multiple queries to
find all occurrences. Flat-named structures are mostly better than
nested ones.

 TESLA WILL NEED SOME HOLLYWOOD MAGIC FOR ITS ROBOTAXI REVEAL (7
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Tesla will likely reveal its long-awaited autonomous robotaxi at the
Warner Bros. movie studio in Los Angeles at an event on October 10.
The 110-acre lot contains fake suburban towns, which could be an ideal
location to test the technology. The company has been collecting data
in the area to help its demonstration perform flawlessly. This
approach suggests that the technology is still far away from true
Level 5 autonomy and restrained by geographic limitations. 

 INTEL REVEALS FIRST LUNAR LAKE LAPTOP CPUS: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO
KNOW (9 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Intel's new Core Ultra 200V lineup, formerly known as Lunar Lake,
claims to beat Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and AMD Strix Point
laptop chips in almost every way. The first wave of laptops is set to
ship on September 24. They will feature a significantly increased
battery life and increased performance. Despite improvements, the
laptops in the new lineup will be limited to 32GB of RAM - users who
want more cores, threads, and RAM will have to wait for Intel's Arrow
Lake, which may be coming as soon as October 10.

many leading video games. 

 WHY YOU SHOULDN'T STORE LARGE FILES IN GIT (6 MINUTE READ) [24] 

 When you add a large file to git, it creates a new entry in the
object database, and since there's no real way to isolate the change,
everyone who ever uses the repository will need to download the file
change.

 YUBIKEYS ARE VULNERABLE TO CLONING ATTACKS THANKS TO NEWLY DISCOVERED
SIDE CHANNEL (9 MINUTE READ) [26] 

 The YubiKey 5 contains an unpatchable cryptographic flaw that makes
it vulnerable to cloning if an attacker gains temporary physical
access to it - all YubiKeys running firmware prior to version 5.7 are
permanently vulnerable.
