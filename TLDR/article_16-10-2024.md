 APPLE A17 PRO CHIP IS THE STAR OF THE FIRST IPAD MINI UPDATE IN THREE
YEARS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple quietly announced a new version of the iPad mini via a press
release yesterday. The seventh-generation device looks mostly
identical to its predecessor, but it features an Apple A17 Pro chip,
the same processor used in the iPhone 15 Pro. The new iPad mini is
available for preorder now starting at $499 for the base 128GB model.
It will be the only iPad mini capable of supporting Apple
Intelligence, which will be rolling out within the next few weeks. The
device will only work with either the Apple Pencil Pro or the cheaper
USB-C Apple Pencil and not the first- or second-generation Apple
Pencils. 

 SPACEX TELLS FCC IT HAS A PLAN TO MAKE STARLINK ABOUT 10 TIMES FASTER
(4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX has submitted an application to the US Federal Communications
Commission seeking approval for changes to Starlink that will enable
gigabit-per-second broadband service. The changes include lowering the
altitude of satellites to increase the potential maximum number of
orbital planes and satellites per plane. SpaceX plans to send 29,988
or less second-generation satellites into orbit - the FCC has so far
approved 7,500 Gen2 satellites. To obtain approval for the changes,
SpaceX will have to demonstrate that the changes won't negatively
affect other spectrum users and satellite operators.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SUSTAINABLE BUILDING EFFORT REACHES NEW HEIGHTS WITH WOODEN
SKYSCRAPERS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mass timber replaces steel beams and concrete with manufactured wood
elements that can extend more than half the length of a football
field. The process of creating the elements involves gluing smaller
pieces of wood together in layers under pressure in large specialized
presses. Beams created with this process can be stronger than steel by
weight. Mass timber buildings tend to be manufactured like
automobiles, with all the separate pieces shipped to a final location
for assembly, making the building process more simple. 

 THE EXCITING RESEARCH THAT MAY CURE PARKINSON'S (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 GeneCode, a pharmaceutical company, received a €16 million funding
option from the European Innovation Council Accelerator last year to
support the development of a novel drug designed to combat
neurodegeneration in Parkinson's patients. Preliminary evidence
suggests that the drug may alleviate symptoms, protect neurons from
further damage, and help restore neurons for a healthier, longer life.
The drug binds to receptors in the brain and sends chemical signals
that stimulate dopamine production, which helps neurons with axons
stay active and maintain synaptic connections with other neurons.
GeneCode has almost completed animal experiments, but it still needs
to certify that the drug can be consistently and safely produced to
ensure future quality assurance and perform toxicology studies before
the drug can begin clinical trials in humans.

 TECH ALLIANCE WANTS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO EXPORT, IMPORT PASSKEYS (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Passkeys are currently confined to companies' software ecosystems,
forcing users to create duplicate keys. The FIDO Alliance, an
association made up of the top tech companies, has announced an
industry effort for a new protocol and format for exchanging passkey
data. This would allow users to share and sync the same collection of
keys across platforms. The draft specifications for the protocol focus
on ways to prevent hackers from abusing the interoperability to steal
passkeys.

 REFLECTIONS ON PALANTIR (35 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Palantir's stock is currently on a tear, with the company nearing a
$100 billion market cap. The company was unpopular in the past as it
was seen as developing spy tech, NSA surveillance, or worse. There's a
lot about the company that people don't understand - this article,
written by someone who has worked at the company for eight years,
attempts to explain some of this. It discusses what working at the
company is like, the company culture, the type of people who work in
the field, the morality of working at companies like Palantir, the
opportunities AI brings, and more. 

 THE INTERNET'S HOMEPAGE (24 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Digg was something like the homepage of the internet in its early
days. The best and most popular stuff made it to the homepage, which
was seen by tens of millions of people every month. The site featured
voting mechanisms and a commenting system, which were brand-new
concepts when it launched. This article contains an interview with
Digg's creator, Kevin Rose, where he talks about why he built the site
the way he did, the legacy of some of the tools he helped create, the
death of the homepage and the rise of the news feed, and what happens
when a company goes from a fun idea to a potential cash cow. Rose
believes that there's a case for Digg to make a comeback, but only in
a very different corporate form.
