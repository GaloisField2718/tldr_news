 AIRPODS PRO TO GAIN 'HEARING AID MODE' IN IOS 18 (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's AirPods Pro will reportedly gain a new 'hearing aid mode'
with iOS 18. The device already offers a Conversation Boost feature,
but Apple has not advertised it as a hearing aid device as that
requires FDA regulatory approval. It is unclear whether Apple will
need FDA clearance to make explicit or implicit claims about the
'hearing aid mode' or whether it will adopt that exact name. The FDA
approved a new category of over-the-counter hearing aids called
Personal sound amplification products in August 2022 that doesn't
require legal registration by manufacturers or listing with the FDA.
iOS 18 is set to be previewed in June and released sometime in
September. 

 ELON MUSK SAYS XAI WILL OPEN SOURCE GROK THIS WEEK (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 xAI will open source Grok this week. The move follows Elon Musk's
complaint that OpenAI has deviated from its open source roots. Musk
has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI claiming that OpenAI, which was
supposed to make its technology freely available to the public, has
become closed-source and has shifted its focus to maximizing profits
for Microsoft. Musk has long been a proponent of open source - Tesla
has open sourced many of its patents. It is unclear what aspects of
Grok will be open sourced.

 COVARIANT ANNOUNCES A UNIVERSAL AI PLATFORM FOR ROBOTS (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Covariant has announced a robotics foundation model that gives robots
a human-like ability to reason. The 8 billion parameter RFM-1 can
expand its abilities through more data consumption. It incorporates
images, video, joint angles, force reading, suction cup strength, and
more into its prediction engine to produce images, videos, or a series
of commands for a robot. It can be used as a simulation tool,
generating action sequences that are both realistic and accurate. With
enough data, it could be a useful world simulation tool more capable
than one built from the ground up. Covariant aims to make the model be
able to do any task in any body. 

 PARKINSON'S DRUG REDUCES DISEASE MARKERS IN BREAKTHROUGH TRIAL (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A novel therapy for Parkinson's disease has shown promise in early
clinical trials. UB-312 is designed to clear toxic clumps of a protein
thought to be responsible for the disease. It has been shown to be
generally safe with relatively mild side effects. There are currently
no treatments that address the underlying condition of Parkinson's.
The therapy's initial success is exciting as it suggests that
scientists are on the right path to finding a safe and effective means
of improving quality of life for Parkinson's patients.

 HOW WE ENGINEER FEEDBACK AT FIGMA WITH ENG CRITS (13 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Figma employees are encouraged to get early feedback on their
in-progress work. Sharing early work can be daunting - it requires an
environment and culture in which individual contributors feel
comfortable bringing up unpolished ideas. Leaving technical reviews
too late can lead to a lot of wasted time. Figma uses engineering
crits to brainstorm novel approaches to technical problems, get
feedback on the existing work, and unblock team members. This article
talks about how Figma implemented its style of engineering crits and
presents a template for other organizations to follow. 

 TYPE UNIONS DON'T ALWAYS COMPOSE WELL (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 TypeScript lets developers write type unions that often feel more
ergonomic compared to other languages, which may force them to tag the
union. These untagged unions often lead to cleaner user-side APIs that
don't require boilerplate boxing up of values. However, if you have
overlaps when using them, the result type might hold less information
than you think. To get the composition to actually represent something
like what you get with data types in other languages, make sure there
is no overlap between the types.

 WHY SIGNAL ‚ÄòTURNED OUR ARCHITECTURE INSIDE OUT‚Äô FOR ITS LATEST
PRIVACY FEATURE (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The decision to add usernames to the upcoming version of Signal was
nowhere near as simple as it sounds. Many countries around the world
are making it increasingly difficult to obtain phone numbers. Using
phone numbers as an identifier is also a security risk for some users.
Signal had to implement usernames without having to deal with
large-scale moderation obligations. Its system is far more limited
than on other platforms that have usernames as canonical identifiers
for users. Beta users can claim their usernames now. 

 TIKTOK SHAREHOLDERS WHO MAKE ANY ‚ÄòDISPARAGING STATEMENT‚Äô ABOUT
THE COMPANY RISK HAVING THEIR ENTIRE HOLDINGS SEIZED (8 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 TikTok's shareholder agreement bans current and former employees from
criticizing the company or risk losing any stock they own. While the
non-disparagement provision is unusual, it isn't illegal as long as it
doesn't prevent, intimidate, or punish employees for filing complaints
with government agencies. The terms in the agreement defining
disparagement are vague. It is unknown whether TikTok has ever seized
stock from any shareholders.
