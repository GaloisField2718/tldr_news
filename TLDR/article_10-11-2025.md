 APPLE PLANS MAJOR NEW SATELLITE-POWERED FEATURES FOR IPHONES (17
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is working on new satellite features, including a satellite
framework for third-party apps, satellite-powered maps, richer
messaging capabilities, 'natural usage' improvements, and satellite
over 5G. Bringing most of these new features to market will require
major upgrades to Globalstar's satellite infrastructure. SpaceX
acquiring Globalstar would force Apple to rethink its business model
and long-term strategy for satellite services. However, it could also
bring opportunities - Apple could collaborate with SpaceX on premium
satellite features. 

 TESLA IS LAUNCHING A CRAZY NEW RENTAL PROGRAM WITH CHEAP DAILY RATES
(4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla's in-house Rental program lets people rent vehicles for between
three to seven days, starting at $60 per day. It includes free
Supercharging and free Full Self-Driving for the duration of the
rental. There are no limits on mileage or charging, but renters are
not allowed to leave the state from which they rented the vehicle.
Customers who purchase their own Tesla within seven days of using the
Rental service will receive up to a $250 credit towards their
purchase.

 RIDING IN A CHINESE ROBOTAXI IS PRETTY SMOOTH—THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR
WAYMO (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Baidu, Pony AI, and WeRide each have hundreds of robotaxis on the
road in China operating commercial paid services without a human
safety driver. Their technology and rider experience are generally
similar to the driverless taxis operated by Waymo in the US. China's
robotaxi fleet is projected to grow to tens of thousands of vehicles
by the end of next year. The Chinese companies are testing autonomous
vehicles in around half a dozen countries - Waymo is only testing its
vehicles in one country outside of the US. 

 GENETICALLY ENGINEERED BABIES ARE BANNED. TECH TITANS ARE TRYING TO
MAKE ONE ANYWAY (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Preventive, a startup backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and his
husband, as well as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, is working toward
creating genetically engineered human children. Editing gene embryos
with the intention of creating babies is banned in the US and many
countries, so the company has been searching for places to experiment
where the practice is allowed. Preventive is part of a growing number
of startups funded by powerful people in Silicon Valley that are
pushing the boundaries of fertility and working to commercialize
reproductive genetic technologies.

 STOP GUESSING. PROVE AI ROI. (SPONSOR) [9] 

 AI spend is rising, but how are you measuring return on investment?
We love this guide from You.com [9], which gives leaders a
step-by-step framework to measure, model, and maximize AI impact. Get
clear KPIs, four ROI formulas (and when to use each), and a
battle-tested LLM prompt [9] for quickly creating your own interactive
ROI calculator. Turn “we think” into “we know.”

 VALDI (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework that compiles TypeScript
directly to native views on iOS, Android, and macOS. It delivers
native performance without sacrificing developer velocity with
automatic view recycling, optimized component rendering, an optimized
layout engine, and viewport-aware rendering. Valdi eliminates the
traditional compile-test-debug cycle that slows native development
with instant hot reload, full VSCode debugging, and a familiar syntax.
It integrates easily into existing apps and can be scaled as needed. 

 YOU NEED TO BECOME A FULL STACK PERSON (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Work is much messier today than when roles were somewhat rigid and
handoffs were clean. Loops are now tighter, and the fast path from
idea to impact crosses multiple disciplines. It is now better to have
cross-domain fluency along with product sense and engineering craft.
AI doesn't lower the cost of choosing the right thing, shaping it
well, and operating it in the wild. Models can accelerate execution,
but developers still own intent, architecture, and accountability.

 INSIDE CURSOR (38 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There's a lot of mystique about Cursor. This article takes a look
inside the company from the perspective of a team member who has been
there for two months. The company's leaders are enthusiastic about
establishing a new playbook for company building. The employees are
focused on the mission - the company has made them wealthy, but there
is zero chatter from employees about getting rich. 

 JENSEN HUANG'S STARK WARNING: CHINA'S 1 MILLION AI WORKERS VS
AMERICA'S 20,000 (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 China has a million people working on AI 24/7, while the US has maybe
20,000 in Silicon Valley. US export controls are producing precisely
the opposite of their intended effects and accelerating China's
development. They have triggered a national mobilization. China is
predicted to have more AI compute than the rest of the world combined
by 2027.
