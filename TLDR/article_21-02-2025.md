 WILL PACASO BE THE UBER OF REAL ESTATE? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Forget DIY renovations. Co-ownership is all anyone in real estate is
talking about. It's simple: buyers share ownership of a high-value
asset, splitting costs while enjoying all the benefits – letting
people utilize premium vacation properties at a fraction of the cost.

And for just $2.70 a share [4], you can invest in the market leader.
Through Pacaso [4]'s digital platform, users buy, sell, and finance
vacation home shares in mere clicks. They've already handed keys to
1,500+ happy homeowners, earning $100M in gross profits, and
attracting investors like Softbank and Maveron. Now, for the first
time, everyday investors can own Pacaso stock.

 OPENAI'S GPT-4.5 MAY ARRIVE NEXT WEEK, BUT GPT-5 IS JUST AROUND THE
CORNER (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI may be preparing to release GPT-4.5 as early as next week -
anonymous sources say that the next model could hit the scene sometime
this month. GPT-5 may be released as early as May. Microsoft has a
good reason to want GPT-5 in May - its annual developer conference is
on May 22. While GPT-5 may be more capable and efficient, it doesn't
necessarily mean there will be any new use cases for AI. 

 AMAZON MGM STUDIOS GAINS CREATIVE CONTROL OF JAMES BOND FRANCHISE
FROM BROCCOLI FAMILY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Broccoli family, which has long controlled the 007 franchise,
will hand over creative control of the series to Amazon MGM Studios in
a new joint venture with the studio. Amazon will now control who will
play Bond, who will write the next script, and when the film goes into
production. The financial terms of the joint venture have not been
disclosed. Amazon and the Broccoli family have been at odds since the
tech company acquired the rights to release Bond movies about three
years ago.

 BIGGEST-EVER AI BIOLOGY MODEL WRITES DNA ON DEMAND (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Scientists have released an artificial intelligence model for biology
trained on 128,000 genomes spanning the tree of life. It can make
sense of existing DNA and also write whole chromosomes and small
genomes from scratch. The model is available to scientists through a
web interface - it can also be downloaded freely. The model could be
used to help identify hard-to-interpret changes in people's genomes,
decipher complex genomes, predict the effects of mutations, and more. 

 FIGURE'S HUMANOID ROBOT TAKES VOICE ORDERS TO HELP AROUND THE HOUSE
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Figure has revealed a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for humanoid
robots. VLAs leverage vision and language commands to process
information, enabling robots to be trained through a combination of
video and large language models. Figure's Helix model enables robots
to follow natural language commands and pick up novel items with
varying shapes, sizes, colors, and material properties never
encountered before in training. Work on Helix is still at a very early
stage, so demonstrations should be taken with a grain of salt.

 DEEPEVAL (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 DeepEval is an open source framework for evaluating and testing large
language model systems. It incorporates the latest research to
evaluate model outputs using locally run models. DeepEval supports
applications implemented via RAG, fine-tuning, LangChain, LlamaIndex,
and more. It helps developers easily determine the optimal
hyperparameters to improve their RAG pipeline, improve prompt
drifting, or transition from OpenAI to hosting their own Llama 3. 

 KUBEVPN (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 KubeVPN provides a Cloud-Native Dev Environment that seamlessly
connects to Kubernetes cluster networks using service names or Pod
IP/Service IP. It enables developers to run Kubernetes pods within
local Docker containers, ensuring an identical environment, volume,
and network setup. KubeVPN empowers developers to create applications
entirely on their local PCs.

 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING JOB OPENINGS HIT FIVE-YEAR LOW? (15 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 There has been a 35% decrease in the number of software engineering
job vacancies in the US since January 2020. While the story is similar
in Canada, things are different in the UK, France, Germany, and
Australia. Australia is the only country where the number of jobs
listed is not lower than in 2020. Software development jobs have been
the biggest boom and bust in vacancies compared to all industries.
This post discusses the reasons for the decrease and predictions for
what growth in the tech industry is likely to be like this year. 

 A.I. IS CHANGING HOW SILICON VALLEY BUILDS START-UPS (6 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Tech startups used to raise huge sums to hire armies of workers and
grow fast, but AI tools are enabling workers to be more efficient,
making tiny teams more successful. Startups are using AI tools to
increase employees' productivity in everything from customer service
and marketing to coding and customer research. They are able to gain
more revenue with fewer employees and less cash, something that
wouldn't have been possible without the technology. The potential for
AI to let startups do more with less has led to wild speculation about
the future.
