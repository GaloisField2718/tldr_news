 OPENAI‚ÄôS CUSTOM GPT STORE IS NOW OPEN FOR BUSINESS (1 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 OpenAI's GPT store has finally launched after a months-long delay.
The store allows users to share custom chatbots, bringing more
potential use cases to ChatGPT and expanding OpenAI's ecosystem.
OpenAI says that more than 3 million bots have been created by users
since the announcement of the GPT Builder program in November. Only
people who subscribe to OpenAI's paid tiers will be able to make and
use custom GPTs. 

 TESLA‚ÄôS REVAMPED MODEL 3 SEDAN HAS NOW GONE ON SALE IN THE US (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla has started selling a restyled version of its Model 3 in North
America. Codenamed Highland, the restyled Model 3 went on sale in

introduction of the vehicle in the US. The Model 3 is no longer
eligible for the credit. A gallery of images showing what's changed is

 THOUSANDS OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERS SAY THE JOB MARKET IS GETTING MUCH
WORSE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Software engineering has been seen as one of the safest havens in the
American job market for much of the 21st century. There are a growing
number of signs that the field is starting to become less secure and
comfortable. An industry-wide downturn and the looming threat of AI is
spurring growing competition for software jobs. Many people believe
that their companies will hire fewer people because of AI moving
forward. 

 DOES DNA HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF IF-STATEMENTS, WHILE LOOPS, OR
FUNCTION CALLS? HOW ABOUT GOTO? (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 While DNA is not analogous to computer code, biological systems have
some pathways that operate in similar ways to computers. 'If'
statements are similar to transcriptional activators, transcriptional
repressors can act as 'while' statements, and there are codes that
make other sections dispensable, kind of like a GOTO statement. There
are no equivalents of function calls as all events happen in the same
space and there is always a likelihood of interference.
