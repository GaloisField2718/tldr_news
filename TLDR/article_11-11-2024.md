OpenAI's new model's performance exceeds its existing models, but the
improvement is less than the jump from GPT-3 to

 INVEST IN THE COMPANY THAT WON OVER THE DRAGONS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Smart-doorbell pioneer, RING, pitched on the hit show SHARK TANK at a
valuation of just $7 MILLION — the sharks shut them down.

5 YEARS LATER, the company sold to Amazon for more than $1 BILLION.
Turning the 10% stake initially offered to the sharks from $700K into
$100M!

A similar story is brewing [4] in the Smart Shades segment of the
industry, with a company called RYSE [4] pitching on the Canadian
version of Shark Tank called DRAGON'S DEN.

THE DIFFERENCE? They received two offers [4] and have an addressable
market that could be significantly larger than that of RING's!

Invest in RYSE alongside the Dragons. [4]

 OPENAI REPORTEDLY DEVELOPING NEW STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH AI
IMPROVEMENT SLOWDOWN (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's new model's performance exceeds its existing models, but the
improvement is less than the jump from GPT-3 to GPT-4. The rate of
improvement seems to be slowing down. OpenAI created a foundations
team to figure out how the company can continue to improve its models.
One of the proposed strategies is to train models on synthetic data
produced by AI models. 

 CHATGPT MONTHLY USAGE MAY NOW RIVAL GOOGLE CHROME (3 MINUTE READ) [6]


 ChatGPT has the most visits out of all generative AI platforms at 3.7
billion worldwide. Google Chrome's monthly users is estimated to be
around 3.45 billion. ChatGPT saw a 17.2% month-over-month growth and a
115.9% year-over-year traffic growth. The Perplexity chatbot saw 90.8
million visits in October, Google's Gemini chatbot saw 295.8 million
visits, Anthropic's Claude saw 84.1 million visits, Microsoft's
Copilot saw 69.4 million visits, and NotebookLM saw 31.5 million
visits.

 SPACEX PITCHES NASA ON 'MARSLINK,' A VERSION OF STARLINK FOR THE RED
PLANET (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX is working on a concept version of Starlink for Mars. It has
ideas about developing next-generation relay services capable of
beaming 4 Mbps or more in data across 1.5 astronomical units. The
Marslink concept involves placing multiple space satellites in Mars
orbit to provide full visibility and interoperability for ground and
orbital assets. Other companies have also submitted proposals - slides
from the recent meeting of the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group
showing each company's proposal are available in the article. 

 HPV VACCINATION: HOW THE WORLD CAN ELIMINATE CERVICAL CANCER (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cervical cancer is caused by a virus (HPV), making it preventable.
The virus is also responsible for a large share of other cancers. HPV
integrates itself into cells' DNA and damages key proteins that
protect the cell from uncontrolled growth, eventually leading to
cancer. HPV vaccines are highly effective in preventing infections -
and cervical cancer. Countries like the UK and Australia are showing
that the elimination of cervical cancer is possible, but much of the
world is missing out.

 IS MANUAL TESTING THE ROOT CAUSE OF YOUR SLOW RELEASES? (SPONSOR) [9]


 Every dev team wants to ship faster. But when E2E testing takes hours
to run, everything slows down. The alternative? Ditch manual testing
and try QA Wolf [9]. Run 100% of your test suite in parallel with
pass/fail results within 3 minutes, and no cap on test runs. Test
constantly. Deploy continuously. Start here [9] 

 EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED SO FAR ABOUT RUNNING LOCAL LLMS (26 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 It is now possible to run a large language model (LLM) smarter than
the original ChatGPT on a Raspberry PI. Running models locally allows
for private, unlimited, and registration-free access. This article
talks about how to run local text-based LLMs on your own hardware. It
covers the software needed, the different models available, user
interfaces, and more. While LLMs are fun, there are still many tasks
they can't reliably do. 

 IRONCALC (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 IronCalc is a modern spreadsheet engine and set of tools for working
with spreadsheets in diverse settings. It can be used with a variety
of programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Node.js, and
possibly R, Julia, and Go. IronCalc is still a work in progress but an
early browser preview is available.

 MOVING PAST SKEUOMORPHIC AI (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI is being limited by our mental models for what to use the
technology for. The current available technology can already be
transformative given the right application mindset. Moving to the next
level will require giving models more autonomy and self-learning
capabilities. We should be building applications around things that AI
is uniquely suited to do. Thinking this way will result in the
creation of new services and products. 

 TOUCH SCREENS ARE OVER. EVEN APPLE IS BRINGING BACK BUTTONS (9 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Screen interfaces require people to look at them, making the 'touch
screen' a misnomer. Buttons, knobs, sliders, and other physical
controls are making a comeback in vehicles, appliances, and personal
electronics. Engineers and designers are tapping into people's sense
of touch and spatial awareness to make using gadgets easier, more fun,
and in some cases, safer. Physical interfaces allow people to use
devices without looking and makes interactions with machines more
intuitive.
