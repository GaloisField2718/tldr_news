 TIKTOK OWNER BYTEDANCE EYES VALUATION OF OVER $330 BILLION AS REVENUE
SURPASSES META (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ByteDance is set to launch a new employee share buyback that will
value it at more than $330 billion. It plans to offer current
employees $200.41 per share in the repurchase program. The buyback is
expected to be launched in the autumn. It's becoming increasingly
common for late-stage private companies to conduct regular buybacks to
retain and provide liquidity to employees without an exit, such as an
initial public offering. 

 GOOGLE HAS ELIMINATED 35% OF MANAGERS OVERSEEING SMALL TEAMS IN PAST
YEAR, EXEC SAYS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has eliminated more than a third of its managers overseeing
small teams in the last year. Many of those managers have stayed with
Google as individual contributors. Google eliminated about 6% of its
workforce in 2023 and has implemented cuts in various divisions since
then. The company has offered buyouts to employees since January and
has slowed hiring.

 BLUESKY NOW PLATFORM OF CHOICE FOR SCIENCE COMMUNITY (14 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Many science communicators moved to Bluesky after Elon Musk bought
Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X. The online scientific community on
Bluesky has now hit a critical mass. Many are finding it to be a
better environment for discussing their interests. Bluesky is
user-friendly with no algorithm. It provides helpful tools for
beginners, and users have the ability to block or mute people. 

 FULLY FUNCTIONING HUMAN SKIN GROWN IN LAB, COMPLETE WITH VESSELS AND
PIGMENTATION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers from the University of Queensland have successfully grown
fully functional human skin in a laboratory. They used stem cells to
create a replica of human skin with blood vessels, capillaries, hair
follicles, multiple layers of tissue, and immune cells. The skin model
took six years to develop. It will be transformative for skin graft
transplants, wound healing, and the study of skin disorders.

 I MANAGED A SWARM OF 20 AI AGENTS FOR A WEEK AND BUILT A PRODUCT.
HERE ARE THE 8 RULES I LEARNED (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI isn't just about writing code faster, it's about changing the
nature of work. Engineers' value is shifting from the act of
implementation to the art of direction. Their worth will be measured
by how many agents they can effectively manage and how well they can
architect an intelligent, self-improving system. Senior engineers and
systems thinkers are about to become even more valuable because they
have the architectural vision to direct these agentic systems. 

 THE UNEXPECTED PRODUCTIVITY BOOST OF RUST (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 At some point, codebases get too big for developers to keep all of
the parts in their heads at the same time. Projects typically hit a
significant slowdown at this stage. However, Rust's strong safety
guarantees make it easier for developers to refactor even critical
parts of apps, giving them more confidence and increasing their
productivity. This allows developers to worry less and try out more
things without worrying about breaking the existing stuff.

 THE RISE OF FRONT-LOADED VESTING (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Front‑loaded vesting - higher Year‑1 value, a smaller initial
grant, and refreshers as the engine of long‑term pay - is becoming
the default. It tightens the link to performance, shifting rewards
from tenure to contribution. Employees should evaluate offers on the
first two years and steady‑state and insist on transparent refresher
rules before signing. With this model, value arrives earlier, so
document impact, broaden cross-functional reach, and align to
promotion rubrics, as mobility and visibility matter. 

 GOOGLE COULD GET BROKEN UP THIS WEEK. HERE'S WHAT IT WOULD MEAN (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A court is widely expected to decide on Google's fate this week after
a decision last year that held that the company broke antitrust laws
by using illegal means to maintain a monopoly over online search. The
court has several options, including breaking up Google by ordering it
to sell Chrome or Android, or making it share valuable data with its
rivals. Whatever it decides, the measure of success is whether people
who work at big companies start quitting their jobs to start new
companies. Previous antitrust cases against large tech companies have
helped spawn industries.
