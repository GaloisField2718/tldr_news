 MUSK'S $97.4 BILLION OPENAI BID PILES PRESSURE ON SAM ALTMAN (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk's offer to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion, backed by a
consortium of investors, could force OpenAI's board of directors to
reassess how it is valuing the nonprofit. OpenAI is currently
negotiating how much equity Microsoft should get in its for-profit
company - satisfying all those parties was already complicated. The
company must get approval for its conversion from attorneys general in
California and Delaware - these officials will oversee the valuation
of the nonprofit's assets during a sale to ensure it is properly
compensated. Sam Altman has stated that he thinks Musk's offer is just
a tactic to slow OpenAI down. 

 LEAKED PIXEL 9A RENDERS SHOW ALMOST NO CAMERA BUMP (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Google appears to be ditching the camera bump this year for the Pixel
9A - it's still there, but just barely. A new set of renders has
leaked showing the phone in black, white, pink, and purple. The back
cameras will include a 48-megapixel main shooter and a 13-megapixel
ultrawide. The phone will have a 13-megapixel selfie camera in the
front and a 5,100mAh battery. The base model of the phone, which will
have 128GB storage, will cost $499. The Pixel 9A will be released on
March 26.

 A YEAR OF TELEPATHY (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There are now three people with Neuralink implants. Combined, these
patients have had their Links implanted for over 670 days and used
Telepathy for over 4,900 hours. All three individuals are unable to

 ARGENTINA'S GENE-EDITED HORSES (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists in Argentina have created genetically edited horses with
increased explosive speed. The five foals have been tweaked to one day
be able to outrun the champion mare they received genes from. Gene
editing is banned by the International Federation for Equestrian
Sports and the British Horseracing Authority, but the biotech firm
that created the foals argues that the new horses' genes could have
theoretically occurred naturally through selective breeding or genetic
mutations.

 META'S HYPERSCALE INFRASTRUCTURE: OVERVIEW AND INSIGHTS (45 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 This article provides a high-level overview of Meta's hyperscale
infrastructure. Meta's engineering culture values moving fast,
technology openness, research in production, and shared
infrastructure. It has adopted continuous deployment universally and
enabled developers to write serverless functions rather than
traditional service code. Meta uses hardware-software co-design at the
data center scale and autonomously optimizes resource allocations to
reduce hardware costs. Its strategy involves co-designing the entire
stack.
