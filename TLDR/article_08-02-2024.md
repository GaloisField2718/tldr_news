 EUROPE‚ÄôS DEEPEST MINE TO BECOME GIANT GRAVITY BATTERY (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The Pyh√§salmi Mine, an abandoned mine in Finland, is set to be
transformed into a giant gravity battery to store renewable energy.
The 1,400-meter-deep mine holds the potential to store up to 2 MW of
energy. Gravity batteries are charged by lifting heavy weights - these
weights are then released, and energy from the drop is used to power a
turbine. The technology offers a potential future for mines
approaching the end of their original service lives. Studies suggest
that gravity batteries in abandoned mines could store enough energy to
meet global electricity demands. 

 MOMENTARY FUSION BREAKTHROUGHS FACE HARD REALITY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new paper has confirmed the National Ignition Facility's claim that
they finally achieved a breakeven fusion reaction. While there is
still considerable work to be done, the achievement signals a major
milestone in fusion science. It demonstrated that there is nothing
fundamentally limiting scientists from being able to harness fusion in
the laboratory. The team has since carried out six more experiments,
four of which generated significantly more energy than in the
breakthrough experiment.

 JQUERY 4.0.0 BETA! (24 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The jQuery 4.0.0 beta features bug fixes, performance improvements,
and some breaking changes, like the removal of support for IE<11.
Other breaking changes include the removal of previously deprecated
APIs, internal-only parameters to public functions, and support for
some magic behaviors that were overly complicated. A comprehensive
upgrade guide will be published before the final release. This article
covers some of the highlights of the jQuery 4.0.0 beta. 

 SCRIPTISTO (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Scriptisto is a language-agnostic shebang interpreter that enables
developers to write scripts in compiled languages. It combines a
scripting development experience with the performance of strongly
typed native languages such as C, C++, and Rust. Scriptisto can build
in Docker, so there is no need to have a compiler on users' machines -
static binaries can be linked in the container that has all the tools.

 MORALE PLUMMETS AT GOOGLE AS WORKERS COMPLAIN BOSSES ARE 'INEPT' AND
'BORING' (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google staff morale is suffering badly and workers are increasingly
vocal about the slump. The company and its work culture are being
described as overly corporate and generally aimless. There is a
growing rift between leadership and employees. While executives seem
excited about the company's future, employees are much less
enthusiastic as they feel they might get laid off at any time. 

 MEET ME IN THE ETERNAL CITY (28 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A network state is the idea that an online community could eventually
move offline into the real world, with the purchase of land and a
community of inhabitants, and become large enough that at least one
pre-existing government is moved to offer diplomatic recognition.
There are many possible ways the idea can play out, but states must be
based on something like a moral innovation or a 'one commandment'.
There are several network-state-inspired projects underway. This
article looks at the concept of the network state and the projects
that are building towards it.
