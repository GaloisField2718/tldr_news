 APPLE CALENDAR'S ‘CONFETTI' COULD OFFER THREE ADVANTAGES OVER
COMPETITORS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple plans to launch a new iCloud-based service called Confetti that
will be tied to the iOS 18.3 Calendar app. Confetti offers a new way
to invite people to parties, functions, and meetings. It will be free

be Photos integration so that attendees can seamlessly share their
photos right from the Calendar event. 

 META'S CTO SAID THE METAVERSE COULD BE A 'LEGENDARY MISADVENTURE' IF
THE COMPANY DOESN'T BOOST SALES, LEAKED MEMO SHOWS (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, told staff that this year was the most
critical for proving whether the metaverse was a visionary feat or a
legendary misadventure. The company recently announced a series of
changes in its Reality Labs division, which plans to launch half a
dozen AI-powered wearable devices this year. Meta's trajectory this
year will give it a good indication of whether smart glasses will be a
really prominent computing platform. A full copy of the memo Bosworth
sent to employees is available in the article.

 ASTROFORGE SELECTS TARGET FOR “HIGH RISK, SEAT OF THE PANTS”
ASTEROID MISSION (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Asteroid mining company AstroForge has plans to intercept a small
M-type asteroid named 2022 OB5 on a mission launching no earlier than
February 26. The asteroid is likely richer in metals than most
asteroids. It will come within 404,000 miles of Earth in January 2026.
AstroForge built its spacecraft in 10 months. The mission's primary
goal is to make sure the spacecraft communicates back to Earth - the
company expects that failure is more likely than success. 

 THE DEVASTATING LEGACY OF LIES IN ALZHEIMER'S SCIENCE (12 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Alzheimer's disease is one of the leading causes of death among older
adults in the US. No treatment has been created despite decades of
research. Fraud and misconduct by scientists have played a huge role
in the lack of progress over the last 25 years. This article looks at
several examples of the deceptive practices employed over the years by
scientists trying to ascend in a brutally competitive field. The
hubris and lassitude around misconduct needs to change, otherwise
skeptics of science will almost certainly act.

 ASK HN: WHAT IS INTERVIEWING LIKE NOW WITH EVERYONE USING AI? (HACKER
NEWS THREAD) [13] 

 Some companies have had to change their interviewing methods due to
candidates using AI to answer questions. However, many have found that
candidates who use AI are less knowledgeable or competent. Most
candidates aren't able to demonstrate critical thought when using AI,
preferring instead to read back answers verbatim. One way for
recruiters to test candidates is by asking them about past and current
challenges, as this helps recruiters understand who the candidate is
and how they would fit into the team. 

 DEVELOPER PHILOSOPHY (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Developers should avoid scenarios where a ground-up rewrite starts to
look attractive. They should aim to have 90% of the work done in 50%
of the available time to leave time for process improvements.
Developers should automate good practices and think about edge cases
where things can fail. There's usually a way to write code more
simply. Code should be written to be testable.

 WE TRIED OPENAI'S NEW DEEP RESEARCH—HERE'S WHAT WE FOUND (13 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 OpenAI's 'deep research' is a new agentic research assistant that can
compile full-blown research reports. Unlike previous versions of
ChatGPT, it runs fully autonomously and works through many steps
before returning an answer. The assistant can take anywhere from one
to 30 minutes to research an answer depending on the complexity of the
question - users can follow its work in real time. This article looks
at how 'deep research' works, how well it works, and the impact the
technology will have on research. 

 THE REALITY OF DATING APPS (55 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article presents a deep dive into the world of dating apps for
those who think that they can be 'fixed'. It looks at some of the
stats in the industry and the complaints that users have about the
apps they use. People don't present themselves well on digital
platforms, which results in either over-hyper-optimization before
meeting or disappointment when meeting. The core problem is that users
don't want to go on dates to find out more about potential partners
and would rather try to find a partner from their bed using
unrealistic criteria.
