 ‚ÄúTHE KING IS DEAD‚Äù ‚Äî CLAUDE 3 SURPASSES GPT-4 ON CHATBOT ARENA
FOR THE FIRST TIME (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus has surpassed OpenAI's GPT-4 for the first
time on Chatbot Arena. Chatbot Arena is a leaderboard run by the Large
Model Systems Organization, a research organization dedicated to open
models. Its site allows visitors to rate outputs from various models,
enabling it to calculate the best models in aggregate. While Claude's
rise is notable, GPT-4 is now over a year old.

Pixel 9 Pro will have a 6.2-inch display, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL will

 ELON MUSK SAYS TESLA OPTIMUS ROBOT SHOULD COST ‚ÄòLESS THAN HALF OF A
CAR‚Äô (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Elon Musk says that Tesla's general-purpose humanoid robot Optimus,
designed to take over repetitive tasks from humans, should cost less
than half the price of a car. He has previously claimed that the
demand for the robot could be as high as 10 to 20 billion units and
that it would account for a majority of Tesla's long-term value. There
is no clear timeline for when the robot will begin production, but
Tesla has been listing more jobs for its robot program lately,
including positions related to supply chains and manufacturing. 

 SCIENTISTS FIND HUMAN BRAINS ARE GETTING LARGER AND LARGER (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A study on MRIs of people born in the 1930s through to the 1970s
found that babies in the 1970s had nearly 15% more brain surface area
and 6.6% more brain volume than in the 1930s. Parts of the brain
associated with memory and learning have also increased in size. It is
unclear if larger brains make people more intelligent, but it could
still be a plus as there are links to better brain health. Larger
brain structures may reflect improved brain development and health.
The percentage of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease has
decreased every decade.

 THE ONE ABOUT THE WEB DEVELOPER JOB MARKET (35 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The developer job market is the worst it has been in over two
decades, even with the AI bubble in full force. It is unlikely to ever
fully bounce back. Finding a good job is only going to get harder -
the overall market might fluctuate, but there isn't much on the
horizon that seems likely to turn the decline around. Effective
documentation, information, and training will likely start getting
harder to find, especially in areas where AI is even less effective
than normal. 

 42.PARQUET ‚Äì A ZIP BOMB FOR THE BIG DATA AGE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apache Parquet, the de facto standard for tabular data exchange, uses
a binary, columnar, and compressed data representation and comes with
enough metadata so that files can be correctly interpreted without
additional information. The format is supported by most modern data
tools and services. Parquet files come with some risks - even
perfectly valid files can be problematic. This article discusses how
to exploit one of the vulnerabilities in the Parquet file format to
create a 'zip bomb' that is only 42 kilobytes large but contains 622
trillion values, requiring over 4 petabytes of memory to decompress.

 THE FIGHT FOR AI TALENT: PAY MILLION-DOLLAR PACKAGES AND BUY WHOLE
TEAMS (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The AI boom is pushing the industry's talent wars to new extremes,
with companies offering million-dollar annual compensation packages
and accelerating stock-vesting schedules to draw people with expertise
and experience to develop generative AI technologies. This is
happening as layoffs continue in other areas of tech. While there is a
surplus of software engineers, the number of candidates who have
trained large language models from scratch or can help solve vexing
problems in AI is scarce. Salespeople in AI are also in demand. 

 HOW AI COULD EXPLODE THE ECONOMY (21 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Artificial intelligence is already making people rich, but some
researchers think this is only the beginning. AI may be set to make
society much richer by causing economic growth at a scale it has never
experienced before. This article looks at arguments for why such a
dramatic explosion in economic growth might be possible. Explosive
growth without causing a loss in jobs may be possible, but even a
small boost can wind up changing all of our lives.
