 😘 KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native service provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for WEB AND MOBILE APPS, reducing your organization's QA
cycle from days to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

Engineering teams MOVE FASTER, releases stay on track, and testing
happens automatically—so developers can focus on building, not
debugging.

The result? Drata [6] achieved 4X MORE TEST CASES and 86% FASTER QA
CYCLES.

⭐ Rated 4.8/5 on G2.

 SPACEX FINALLY GOT EXACTLY WHAT IT NEEDED FROM STARSHIP V2 (12 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Starship performed a near-perfect flight test on Monday. The fifth
and final flight of Starship's second-generation configuration, the
test reached every objective and provided valuable data for the next
generation of Starship and Super Heavy. It will likely be at least a
few months before SpaceX is ready to launch the next Starship flight.
Starship V3 will have larger propellant tanks, upgraded Raptor 3
engines, and an improved payload compartment to support launches of
real Starlink satellites. 

 WALMART TEAMS UP WITH OPENAI TO ALLOW PURCHASES DIRECTLY IN CHATGPT
(2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Shoppers are increasingly going to ChatGPT for gift ideas or help
finding the best deals. ChatGPT users will soon be able to purchase
items from Walmart directly in chat. Walmart has not disclosed the
financial terms of the deal, nor has it set a release date. OpenAI has
previously said it will charge companies a fee for transactions
completed through ChatGPT.

 WHY AI COMPANIES ARE RACING TO BUILD A VIRTUAL HUMAN CELL (7 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Biologists have been building mathematical models of cellular
processes for decades. There is now more data about the human cell
than ever before, but figuring out equations for every process and
putting them all together is a monumental task. Researchers are now
exploring ways to use AI to create virtual cells. Virtual cells could
make it faster and easier to discover new drugs and also give insight
into how to treat diseases. 

 BORING COMPANY TO OPEN FIRST INTERNATIONAL TUNNEL IN DUBAI BY 2026 (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The first phase of the 'Dubai Loop' is expected to begin operations
by the second quarter of 2026. A 17-kilometer underground transport
system, the Dubai Loop is designed to move up to 20,000 passengers per
hour. The project could turn The Boring Company from an experimental
Las Vegas curiosity to a global player in next-generation urban
transport. It is unclear whether the Dubai Loop will rely on Tesla
vehicles like the Vegas Loop.

 WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH GITHUB SPEC KIT (24 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The GitHub Spec Kit was born out of research on how to help steer the
software development process with large language models more
deterministically. It implements the concept of Spec-Driven
Development to help developers produce deterministically good
software. Spec-Driven Development makes specifications executable,
directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding
them. This post provides a walkthrough on how to get started with the
GitHub Spec Kit. 

 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ARE A LEGACY MESS: LET'S DIVE DEEP INTO THEM
(11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Programming languages have evolved rapidly in recent years, making
environment variables obsolete. While environment variables allow
users to pass ad-hoc variables at runtime, they are awkward to use,
and the interface is outdated. They have no namespaces or types, just
a flat global dictionary of strings. This post looks at how
environment variables work.

 THE NEW WORLD (80 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Thrive Capital's first fund was $5 million in 2010. Its eighth fund
in 2023 was $3.3 billion. Thrive's bets on Instagram, Spotify, GitHub,
Slack, Robinhood, and other companies have become conspicuous for
being prescient, aesthetic, and exquisitely timed. This article takes
a look at Thrive's founder, Joshua Kushner, his family, and how he
built Thrive into the firm it is today. 

 HOW US PRESSURED NETHERLANDS TO OUST CEO OF CHINESE-OWNED CHIP MAKER
(6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Late last month, the Dutch economy ministry seized control of
Nexperia from China's Wingtech Technology and suspended Wintech
founder Zhang Xuezheng from his position as CEO. The seizure and
ouster underscore US-China tensions across the tech sector. US
officials had warned their Dutch counterparts earlier that if they
wanted to avoid Nexperia from being put on a trade blacklist, they
would almost certainly have to remove its Chinese owner as CEO. The
Dutch economy minister claims that the move was based on evidence that
the CEO was moving quickly to shift production capacity, financial
resources, and intellectual property to China, not because of pressure
from any other country.
