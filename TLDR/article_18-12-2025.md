 THE AI VOICE TOOL THAT HELPS YOU MOVE FASTER EVERYWHERE (SPONSOR) [4]


 For 150 years, we've been stuck typing. Wispr Flow [4] ends that era.

you stop speaking — in Slack, Notion, Gmail, ChatGPT, or anywhere
you already work.

Flow learns your phrasing [4], edits as you speak, and helps you move
4× faster across every app — from enhancing GPT prompts to
capturing ideas or writing docs in seconds.

It's how builders, founders, and vibe coders stay in flow all day.

Less typing. More creating.

 CONNECTOME PIONEER SEBASTIAN SEUNG IS BUILDING A DIGITAL BRAIN (9
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sebastian Seung, a neuroscience and computer science professor at
Princeton University, was one of the researchers who helped create the
first complete wiring diagram of a fly's brain. He has created a
startup called Memazing to create the technology needed to reverse
engineer the fly brain (and eventually more complex organisms) and
create full recreations of the brain in software. The company's goal
is to use an existing map of how nature has produced intelligence to
create a new form of artificial intelligence. The startup is still in
a very early stage and is in the process of raising funds, but the
team has already begun work on the fly brain emulation and has started
connecting a model to a simple robotics system. 

 NASA FINALLY—AND WE REALLY DO MEAN IT THIS TIME—HAS A FULL-TIME
LEADER (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Jared Isaacman, at 42 years old, is the youngest person to lead NASA.

the agency employees took buyouts or early retirements thanks to the
Department of Government Efficiency. NASA is locked into a high-stakes
race with China to return humans to the Moon, but the agency has to
deal with an administration that sought to cut its budget by 24%.

 2025 STACK OVERFLOW DEVELOPER SURVEY (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Stack Overflow Developer Survey looks at the tools and technologies
developers are currently using and the ones they want to use. This
year's survey included questions about embedded technology tools and
industry-sourced, community-vetted technology options. Python's
adoption has accelerated significantly due to its ability to be the
go-to language for AI, data science, and back-end development. Redis
saw significant growth in usage, demonstrating the need for
high-speed, in-memory caching and data structures. Docker is now a
near-universal tool for cloud development. AI-enabled IDEs weren't
able to topple the dominance of Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code -
both have maintained the top spots for four years. 

 THE STATE OF AI CODING 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [11]

recent trends in AI software development. It covers productivity gain
across development workflows, AI tool adoption, model growth trends,
performance across latency, cost, and tokenization, and recent papers
on foundational models and applications. Code output has increased
