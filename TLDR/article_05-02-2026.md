 ALPHABET PLANS RECORD SPENDING IN RACE TO WIN AI CUSTOMERS (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Alphabet has announced an ambitious capital spending plan that far
surpasses predictions. The company will spend as much as $185 billion
this year on capital expenditures. CEO Sundar Pichai has reassured
investors that the costs are necessary. Alphabet claims its massive
investments are essential for competing against rivals. 

 ALEXA+ PLUS CHATGPT? (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Amazon may put upwards of $50 billion into OpenAI's next fundraise.
The companies are discussing a commercial agreement that could require
OpenAI to dedicate researchers and engineers to develop customized
models for Amazon. Amazon recently opened up Alexa+ to the US market.
Adding OpenAI's technology could help Amazon combat Apple's upcoming
rollout of Siri powered by Gemini.

 NASA FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WITH THE SLS
ROCKET (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Space Launch System rocket program is now a decade and a half
old. It has so far cost US taxpayers more than $30 billion. The
program continues to be plagued with issues. NASA's new administrator
has acknowledged the low flight rate issue, saying that it should be a
topic of discussion. 

 FIRST-EVER EXPERIMENTAL GENE THERAPY SEEKS TO RESTORE VISION BY
REJUVENATING EYE NEURONS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ER-100 is an experimental gene therapy designed to restore vision by
reviving damaged neurons in the eye. The approach resets aged retinal
cells to a healthier state using epigenetic reprogramming. It received
FDA approval for human trials last week. If successful, ER-100 could
signal a broader shift in how age-related diseases are treated.

 TLDR IS HIRING A SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER, APPLIED AI ($200K-$300K,
FULLY REMOTE) [9] 

 As the first engineer on TLDR's new Applied AI team, you'll build AI
agents and composable Claude Skills to let non-technical teammates
create their own AI workflows. Learn more [10]. 

 AGENTIC ENGINEERING (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Agentic engineering is a professional term that describes what is
actually happening: the engineer orchestrates AI agents as they act as
an architect, reviewer, and decision maker. It is a serious
engineering discipline that involves autonomous agents. The term
definitely sounds better than 'vibe coding' in professional settings.
Agentic engineering disproportionately benefits senior engineers who
understand system design, security patterns, and performance
tradeoffs. They know what good code looks like, so they can
efficiently review and correct AI output. 

 CLAUDE AND CODEX ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN PUBLIC PREVIEW ON GITHUB (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Claude by Anthropic and OpenAI Codex are now available as coding
agents for Copilot Pro+ and Copilot Enterprise customers. Users can
assign work to these agents directly from issues, pull requests, the
Agents tab in enabled repositories, and the agent sessions view in VS
Code. Access to Claude and Codex is included with existing Copilot
subscriptions. Each coding agent session consumes one premium request
during public preview.

 AS ROCKS MAY THINK (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 LLM-based reasoning is both powerful and flexible. However, there is
likely still room to make the recipe even simpler. There are also
still more gains to be had by understanding all the plays in which
thinking behavior can be found. The extra reasoning data generated
over recent years may help further train models to reason better
through previously unviable methods. 

 OPENCLAW IS WHAT APPLE INTELLIGENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Mac Minis are selling out everywhere because people are using them to
run OpenClaw, an open source framework for local AI agents that has
become a killer app for Mac hardware. The rush shows that there is a
clear demand for agents and automation, and Apple is getting the
hardware revenue from it. However, it's missing out on the platform
revenue - Apple could have created its own native agent, but this
would likely have caused significant legal issues.
