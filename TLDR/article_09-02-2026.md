 SPACEX IS EXPLORING A “STARLINK PHONE” FOR DIRECT-TO-DEVICE
INTERNET SERVICES (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SpaceX may be considering building a mobile device designed to
connect directly to the Starlink satellite constellation. Elon Musk
has acknowledged the idea of a potential mobile device, saying that a
Starlink phone isn't out of the question. Starlink has become SpaceX's
dominant commercial business, generating about $8 billion in profit
last year. The company currently serves over 9 million users worldwide
with more than 9,500 Starlink satellites. 

 APPLE PREPARES TO KICK OFF 2026 WITH THE IPHONE 17E, NEW IPADS, AND
MACS (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Apple plans to release a slew of products over the next several
weeks. The iPhone 17e is set to launch imminently at $599, and updated
iPads with Apple Intelligence will be coming soon. There are also
several Macs coming shortly, including new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook
Pros, a new MacBook Air with an M5 processor, and upgraded Mac Studio
desktops. Apple is launching a new low-cost MacBook in the first half
of the year designed to compete with less expensive Windows laptops
and Chromebooks. Other releases later in the year include iOS 26.4,
Apple's first foldable iPhone, a MacBook Pro with an OLED screen and
touch support, and the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SPACEX DELAYS MARS PLANS TO FOCUS ON MOON (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 SpaceX will delay a mission to Mars planned for this year to instead
focus on a long-promised lunar voyage for NASA. The company is
targeting March 2027 for a lunar landing without humans on board.
Before heading to the Moon, SpaceX will need to demonstrate that
Starship can be frequently launched and refuel while in orbit. Blue
Origin is pushing to beat SpaceX to the moon with its own moon-landing
system. It has paused its suborbital tourism business to also focus on
lunar efforts. 

 TO REUSE OR NOT REUSE—THE ETERNAL DEBATE OF NEW GLENN'S SECOND
STAGE REIGNITES (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Blue Origin engineers have been debating for over 15 years whether
the upper stage of New Glenn should be fully reusable or to ruthlessly
cut its manufacturing costs. A new job posting for a director of upper
stage development suggests that the debate may be swinging back toward
reusing the upper stage. With the planned upgrade to New Glenn, an
upper stage may cost around $100 million to manufacture, putting
pressure on the company to find a pathway to reuse. Upper stage reuse
is still a new field, so the new director has their work cut out for
them.

 Clerk's new Client Trust feature detects and blocks automated login
attempts out of the box. No config, no extra cost. 

 SOFTWARE FACTORIES AND THE AGENTIC MOMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Agentic Moment has profoundly changed the economics of software.
Creating high-fidelity clones of SaaS applications was always
possible, but not economically feasible. These clones can be used to
validate at volumes and rates that far exceed production limits and
allow for the testing of failure modes that would be dangerous or
impossible against live services. This is handy when developing tests
for software factories, non-interactive development environments where
specs and scenarios drive agents that write code, run harnesses, and
converge without human review. 

 VOUCH (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Vouch is a community trust management system. It requires people to
be vouched for before they can interact with certain parts of a
project. People can be explicitly denounced to block them from
interacting with a project. The implementation can be used for any
project on any code forge. Vouch lists can be configured to read other
projects' lists of vouched or denounced users, so projects with shared
values can share their trust decisions with each other.

 END GAME PLAY (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The opening has been engineered out. However, the endgame is still an
unknown playing field. Elon Musk skips the middlegame, and it works -
SpaceX and Tesla are examples of terminal endgame reasoning. Endgame
play is a symptom of simulation: Musk simulates forward and treats
everything between here and the terminal state as bottleneck. However,
it's important not to confuse simulating an endgame with arriving at
one. The ability to model the terminal state doesn't mean that the
terminal state is close. 

 THE ANTHROPIC HIVE MIND (16 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Anthropic's employees often describe it as a hive mind entirely run
on vibes. There is a lot of chaos, and it is not run like any other
company of its size. Anthropic has yet to bother with becoming
'professional', yet it is clearly in the middle of a Golden Age.
Organizations reflect their leaders, so this chaos is likely
intentional.

 WHY TOKENS CAN'T COMPOUND (13 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Today's crypto networks pass value through instead of compounding it,
but once someone figures out how to retain and reinvest value the way
a great business does, tokens will become equity in all but name.
