 META'S BATTLE WITH CHATGPT BEGINS NOW (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Meta's AI assistant is being integrated into search boxes within its
apps. It will start appearing directly in the main Facebook feed and
users can chat with it using Meta's messaging apps. The assistant is
also accessible via a standalone website. It runs on Meta's new Llama
3 model, which outperforms competing models of its class on key
benchmarks. The assistant integrates real-time search results from
both Bing and Google and can generate images. 

 GOOGLE MERGES THE ANDROID, CHROME, AND HARDWARE DIVISIONS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google has reorganized its Android, Chrome, and Google hardware
divisions, merging them under a new 'Platforms and Devices' division.
The new division will be led by Google Hardware SVP Rick Osterloh. It
will include a group from Google Research that has been working on
computational photography. The unified team will help Google deliver
higher-quality products and experiences for its users and partners.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 TWO LIFEFORMS MERGE IN ONCE-IN-A-BILLION-YEARS EVOLUTIONARY EVENT (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Scientists have witnessed a rare phenomenon called primary
endosymbiosis, where one microbial organism engulfs another and starts
using it like an internal organ. The process results in the host cell
providing nutrients, energy, protection, and other benefits to the
symbiote, which eventually becomes an organelle. It is being observed
in a species of algae which have engulfed a cyanobacterium, allowing
the algae to obtain nitrogen straight from the air. The relationship
between the two organisms started to evolve around 100 million years
ago. Studying the process may provide a new path to incorporate
nitrogen-fixing into plants to grow better crops. 

 VIDEO: BOOM'S XB-1 CLEARED FOR SUPERSONIC TEST FLIGHTS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The US FAA has given Boom the first-ever Special Flight Authorization
to Exceed Mach. The authorization will allow the company's XB-1
prototype to break the sound barrier during its test flights. The
permission designated the Black Mountain Supersonic Corridor at
Edwards Air Force Base in California and part of the High Altitude
Supersonic Corridor within the R-2515 airspace as a permissible area
for Boom to conduct supersonic test flights. Boom still has to
complete up to 20 subsonic tests before starting supersonic tests.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 HATCHET (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 Hatchet is a distributed fault-tolerant task queue. It replaces
difficult-to-manage legacy queues and pub/sub systems so that
developers can design durable workloads that recover from failure and
solve for problems like concurrency, fairness, and rate limiting.
Hatchet can be used to distribute functions between sets of workers
with minimal configuration or infrastructure. Example use cases for
Hatchet include fairness for generative AI, batch processing for
document indexing, workflow orchestration for multi-modal systems, and
correctness for event-based processing. 

 OTEL-PROFILING-AGENT (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 otel-profiling-agent is a whole-system cross-language profiler for
Linux via eBPF. It implements the experiential OTel profiling signal
with very low CPU and memory overhead. otel-profiling-agent features
support for C/C++ executables, profiling of system libraries, mixed
stack traces between runtimes, and more.

 CHINA ORDERS APPLE TO REMOVE POPULAR MESSAGING APPS (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 China has ordered Apple to remove some of the world's most popular
messaging apps from the App Store in the country. WhatsApp, Threads,
Signal, Telegram, and Line have now been removed from the store. Apple
said it was told to remove the apps due to national security concerns.
The messaging apps were only accessible in China through virtual
private networks, but they were still commonly used. China's
increasing censorship will likely result in more apps being removed
from app stores over the coming months. 

 CHEMISTS INVENT DRUGS AND DRUGS SAVE LIVES (23 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Drug development is an integrated team effort with crucial players
from both the biology and chemistry disciplines. However, the design,
synthesis, purification, and characterization of new drugs lies
squarely within the domain of chemistry. Physicians administer drugs,
but they don't usually invent them. The public needs to be more aware
of chemists' involvement with the drug development process so that
they can better help resolve the myriad of problems confronting
humankind.
