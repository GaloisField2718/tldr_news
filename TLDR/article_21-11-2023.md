 MICROSOFT HIRES FORMER OPENAI CEO SAM ALTMAN (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Microsoft has hired Sam Altman and Greg Brockman to lead its new
advanced AI research team. Altman will be the CEO of this new group.
The new team will include some key OpenAI talent. Former Twitch CEO
and co-founder Emmett Shear has been named as interim CEO at OpenAI.
Altman had been negotiating a return to OpenAI, but the company's
board refused to step down and let him return. Microsoft still has a
multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI and will remain committed to
its partnership with the company. 

 HUNDREDS OF OPENAI EMPLOYEES THREATEN TO RESIGN AND JOIN MICROSOFT (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Most of the staff at OpenAI have threatened to resign from the
company and join Microsoft. Microsoft has assured OpenAI staff that
there are positions for all OpenAI employees in its new advanced AI
research team should they choose to join. Over 650 out of a total of
770 OpenAI staff have signed a letter saying they will leave if the
board doesn't reinstate Sam Altman and Greg Brockman and then resign.
The board seems to have decided to remain in place - they have named a
new CEO, Emmett Shear.

 NYC WILL SOON BE HOME TO 15 ROBOT-RUN VEGETARIAN RESTAURANTS FROM
CHIPOTLE‚ÄôS FOUNDER (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Kernel, a new endeavor from the founder of Chipotle, is a vegetarian
fast-casual restaurant that will be operated mostly by robots. There
are plans to open at least 15 locations with the first opening by
early 2024. The remainder will be on track for New York City in the
next two years. Each location will employ three workers who will
receive more pay and better benefits than people working at other
chains. 

 ‚ÄòELECTROCALORIC‚Äô HEAT PUMP COULD TRANSFORM AIR CONDITIONING (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new type of heat pump developed by materials scientists at the
Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology in Belvaux uses
electric fields and a special ceramic to warm or cool air. The
technology combines a number of existing techniques and could be
potentially competitive with heat pumps without the need for
refrigerants in a smaller space. It still needs to be refined further
before it is ready for commercialization.

 THOSE WHO HAVE MAINTAINED FORKS OF OSS AT WORK, WHAT WAS YOUR
EXPERIENCE LIKE? (LOBSTERS THREAD) [9]

 A GUIDE TO LLM INFERENCE AND PERFORMANCE (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Using the full power of the GPU during LLM inference requires knowing
if the inference is compute-bound or memory-bound. Calculating the
operations per byte possible on a given GPU and comparing it to the
arithmetic of a model's attention layers reveals where the bottleneck
is. This information can be used to pick an appropriate GPU for model
inference and use techniques like batching to better utilize GPU
resources.

 OPENAI‚ÄôS MISALIGNMENT AND MICROSOFT‚ÄôS GAIN (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI fired Sam Altman on Friday. Altman was quickly hired by
Microsoft. This has caused a talent drain within OpenAI, with a good
portion of it going to Microsoft. The situation highlights the
problems of running a non-profit organization. This article looks at
OpenAI's non-profit model, the issues within OpenAI, Microsoft's
involvement, and how these recent events will change the AI landscape.


 A SECRET GOOGLE DEAL LET SPOTIFY COMPLETELY BYPASS ANDROID‚ÄôS APP
STORE FEES (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Spotify doesn't pay any commission fees when it uses its own payment
processor on Android. It only pays a 4% fee when users choose to use
Google as their payment processor. Google fought to keep the terms of
its deal with Spotify secret during its antitrust trial as it could
damage negotiations with other app developers who might want more
generous fees. Spotify's unprecedented popularity was enough to
justify a bespoke deal.
