 SNAP'S NEW SPECTACLES INCH CLOSER TO COMPELLING AR (8 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Snap's fifth-generation Spectacles have a richer, more immersive
display. They feel faster and last longer on a charge. The new
Spectacles will not be sold but will be instead distributed to
developers making AR lenses for Snapchat. Developers will have to
apply for access through Lens Studio, Snap's desktop tool for creating
AR software, and pay $99 per month to rent a pair of Spectacles for at
least one year. This article takes a look at what it's like to wear
the new Spectacles. 

 SALESFORCE'S NEW AI STRATEGY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT AI WILL TAKE JOBS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Salesforce says that its AI tools can handle tasks without human
supervision. The company plans to charge $2 per conversion held by its
new generative AI agents. Salesforce is insulating itself from
customer job cuts by pricing its new AI features based on outcomes
rather than the number of employees using it. Its new AI agents will
allow companies to increase their workforce capacity during busy
periods without having to hire additional full-time employees or gig
workers.

 MUSK'S NEURALINK GETS FDA'S BREAKTHROUGH DEVICE TAG FOR 'BLINDSIGHT'
IMPLANT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Neuralink's experimental 'Blindsight' device, which is designed to
enable even those who have lost both eyes and their optic nerve to
see, has received the US FDA's breakthrough device designation. The
'breakthrough' tag is given to certain medical devices that provide
treatment for or diagnosis of life-threatening conditions. It is aimed
at speeding up the development and review of devices. Neuralink is
currently testing an implant designed to give paralyzed patients the
ability to use digital devices by thinking - it is unknown when it
expects Blindsight devices to move into human trials. 

 WHY UNITED CHOSE SPACEX'S STARLINK TO POWER ITS FREE WI-FI (7 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 United Airlines has signed an agreement with SpaceX to bring Starlink
internet services to its entire fleet and offer free Wi-Fi to all
passengers. United is currently using a mix of four different
providers, all with different capabilities and limitations. Starlink
is the only service that provides global coverage with enough
bandwidth. Its hardware is also easy to install, with the satellite
terminals being much smaller than the ones United currently uses. The
first passenger flight with Starlink Wi-Fi will take off sometime in
2025.

 UNFORTUNATE STARTUP PIVOTS. A SHORT LIST (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Going from B2B to consumer doesn't work as the founding team's
strengths usually lie in selling to enterprise customers and having a
deep network in a specific vertical. Adding more social features
rarely helps. Neither does chasing trendy tech like AI or web3. Other
common mistakes include building platforms prematurely and going from
paid to free. 

 WHAT ARE THE BEST OPTIONS FOR AMAZON SDES THINKING ABOUT LEAVING OVER
RTO POLICY (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [14] 

 This thread is for SDEs thinking of leaving Amazon over the 5-day
return-to-office announcement. It discusses the best options for
work-from-home, flexibility, interesting projects, and salaries. There
are a lot of good options out there, but workers may have to accept
lower pay. Talented Amazon engineers should basically have the 'pick
of the litter' and companies will likely be fawning over them. Amazon
recruiters periodically ping previous employees to see if they're
interested in returning, so it's worth leaving the company on good
terms.
