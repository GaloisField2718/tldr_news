SUPPORT FOR TWO EXTERNAL DISPLAYS, FASTER WI-FI (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple has announced next-generation M3 MacBook Airs in 13-inch and

upgraded Neural Engine, up to 2x faster Wi-Fi, and the ability to
connect to two displays at once - when the laptop lid is closed. The
overall design of the M3 MacBook Air is the same as the M2 model. The
new MacBook Airs can be ordered from the Apple online store starting
at $1099 for the 13-inch and $1299 for the 15-inch model. Shipping
will start on March 8. 

 THE AI WARS HEAT UP WITH CLAUDE 3, CLAIMED TO HAVE ‚ÄúNEAR-HUMAN‚Äù
ABILITIES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic's Claude 3 apparently sets new industry benchmarks across a
range of cognitive tasks. The company claims that it approaches
'near-human' capability in some cases. Claude 3 has three models:
Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Sonnet (which powers the Claude.ai chatbot),
and Claude 3 Opus (available through a subscription service). All
three models feature a 200,000-token context window and are available
through an API. Claude 3 beats GPT-4 on a range of widely used
benchmarks.

 AWS ACQUIRING DATA CENTER CAMPUS POWERED BY NUCLEAR ENERGY (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Amazon Web Services purchased a data center campus powered by a
nearby nuclear power station in Pennsylvania for $650 million. The
nuclear power plant has been in operation since 1983. It will supply
AWS with electricity for 10 years as part of the purchase agreement.
The data center campus comprises 1,200 acres. AWS also plans to invest
$5.3 billion in Saudi Arabia over the next few years to create an AWS
Infrastructure Region.

 THE HUNT FOR THE MISSING DATA TYPE (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While developers see graphs everywhere and use them to analyze all
sorts of systems, there is almost no graph support in any mainstream
language. This is because there are too many different kinds of
graphs, representations of each kind of graph, and graph algorithms.
Also, graph algorithm performance is very sensitive to graph
representation and implementation details. Languages don't support
graphs in their standard libraries because there are too many design
decisions and tradeoffs and too much maintenance burden. This also
explains why programmers avoid third-party graph libraries - they're
either too limited to too slow.

 GOOGLE CO-FOUNDER SERGEY BRIN SAYS IN RARE PUBLIC APPEARANCE THAT
COMPANY ‚ÄòDEFINITELY MESSED UP‚Äô GEMINI IMAGE LAUNCH (7 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Alphabet co-founder Sergey Brin, who came out of retirement to work
on AI, spoke to a group of artificial intelligence enthusiasts over
the weekend at the 'AGI House' in Hillsborough, California, about AI's
impact on search and how Google might maintain its leadership position
as AI continues to grow. Brin commented on the launch of Google's
image generator, saying that the company messed up due to a lack of
thorough testing. He also spoke about other topics such as virtual and
augmented reality hardware and Gemini's potential impact on products
like Google Maps and Street View. 

 AGGREGATOR‚ÄôS AI RISK (27 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Internet made publishing and distribution zero marginal cost
activities. It created a new world of abundance, but it also created a
new type of power given to those who had the ability to make sense of
that abundance. Allowing anyone to publish didn't further decentralize
power - new powers emerged to control discovery. Generative AI flips
that paradigm around, collapsing all published knowledge into a single
answer. This answer is unlikely to make everyone happy. A potential
solution to this problem is to personalize AIs so they do a better job
of giving people what they want to see.
