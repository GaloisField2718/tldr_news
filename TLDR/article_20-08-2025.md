 Google and Kairos Power plan to deploy an advanced nuclear power

 GENAI FOMO HAS SPURRED BUSINESSES TO LIGHT NEARLY $40 BILLION ON FIRE
(5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 US companies have invested between $35 to $40 billion in generative
AI initiatives, and so far have almost nothing to show for it. Only 5%
of organizations have successfully integrated AI tools into production
at scale. Confidence in AI initiatives is declining among corporate
leaders. The divide is due to the inability of AI systems to retain
data, adapt, and learn over time, rather than insufficient
infrastructure, learning, or talent.

ChatGPT truly personal. OpenAI has been working closely with
psychologists to help shape the product.
