TLDR 2025-08-07

 AFTER 21 YEARS, BASECAMP REMAINS THE MOST REFRESHINGLY
STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY TO MANAGE PROJECTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 There's big investor money in project management. That's a big
incentive to make bloated, barely-useable products — designed to
tick boxes in a procurement manager's checklist.

Basecamp [4] has been bucking this trend for more than two decades.
It's famously no-nonsense, effective, and reliable [4]. It's designed
for smaller, hungrier businesses who just need to get things done.

And it's still going strong — without spending hundreds of millions
of VC dollars on marketing.

No superbowl ads. No tacked-on AI.

Just the features you need to manage projects — from chat (bye bye
Slack) to Kanban to docs.

 OPENAI IN TALKS FOR SHARE SALE AT $500 BILLION VALUATION (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is in early talks about a potential sale of stock for current
and former employees at a value of about $500 billion. Investors have
approached OpenAI about buying some of the employee shares. If the
deal goes ahead, OpenAI's on-paper price would rise by roughly
two-thirds. The company expects to reach 700 million active weekly
users this week, up from 500 million at the end of March. 

 INSTAGRAM TAKES ON SNAPCHAT WITH NEW ‘INSTAGRAM MAP' (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Instagram's new map feature lets users share their most recent active
location with others and discover location-based content. The feature
also allows users to leave short messages on the map for others to
see. Location sharing is off by default in Instagram Map, and users'
locations only show up when they open the app, so it doesn't provide
real-time location updates. The new feature has launched in the US and
will be available globally soon.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 NEW METHOD IS THE FASTEST WAY TO FIND THE BEST ROUTES (10 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 One of the most iconic problems in computer science is finding the
shortest path from a specific starting point in a network to every
other point. A team of researchers has devised a new algorithm that
solves the problem without sorting, and it runs faster than any
algorithm that does, including Dijkstra's algorithm. The new
algorithm's runtime breaks the previous sorting barrier, and it can
likely be streamlined to run even faster. This article tells the story
of how the algorithm was developed. 

 INSIDE CHSN01: CHINA'S HIGH-STRENGTH STEEL POWERING NEXT-GEN FUSION
REACTORS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Fusion projects such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor (ITER) rely on 316LN or JK2LB cryogenic stainless steels,
which hold up well at liquid-helium temperatures, but their yield
strength limits the magnetic field of ITER at 11.8 tesla and forces a
large, expensive machine design. Chinese developers created CHSN01
(China High-Strength, Low-Temperature Steel No. 1) to withstand 20
Tesla fields and 1.3 GPa combined electromagnetic stress while still
stretching about 30% before breaking. It keeps those properties after
60,000 on/off cycles, the lifetime workload of China's Burning-Plasma
Experimental Superconducting Tokamak (BEST). CHSN01 can be used in MRI
scanners, particle accelerators, maglev trains, and even
quantum-computing dilution refrigerators - swapping in a stronger and
tougher steel could shrink magnet footprints and extend service
intervals across the board.

 WE SHOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED LOCKFILES (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The concept of lockfiles is unnecessary, and it complicates things
for no reason. Maven, a 20-year-old Java library ecosystem, has never
once needed a lock file. Dependency managers can and are working
without lockfiles just the same. 

 COMPTIME.TS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 comptime.ts is a simple TypeScript compiler that enables compile-time
evaluation of expressions marked with 'comptime'. It can help optimize
code by moving computations from run time to compile time. comptime
should not be used for complex runtime logic, side effects, or
non-deterministic operations. It is useful for computing constant
values, generating static content, and optimizing performance-critical
code.

 SO LONG TO TECH'S DREAM JOB (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The world of tech is changing: long-term employees are reporting a
completely different work environment from what they experienced years
ago. Pay and bonuses are declining, as well as other perks, like a
relaxed atmosphere and occasional fun office activities like Nerf gun
fights. Tech behemoths have aged into large bureaucracies. While many
of them still provide free food and pay well, they have little
compunction about cutting jobs, ordering mandatory office attendance,
or clamping down on employee debate. 

 PARADIGM SHIFTS AND THE WINNER'S CURSE (28 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The two most important companies of the last two decades of tech were
Apple and Amazon, specifically AWS. Apple created the smartphone
paradigm with the iPhone, and AWS' cloud platform enabled a universe
of applications that ran everywhere. Microsoft and Nokia failed in the
smartphone era because they both deluded themselves into thinking that
their previous domination was an advantage. AI is a paradigm shift,
just like mobile was. While the winners of the previous paradigm are
not automatically fundamentally handicapped because of their previous
successes, they need to be careful about making the wrong choices for
years before it's too late.
