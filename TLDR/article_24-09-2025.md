 BUILDING A TINY, USEFUL AI AGENT: A HELLO WORLD TUTORIAL USING ORKES
CONDUCTOR (SPONSOR) [4] 

 With all the noise about agents, it's easy to forget that an agent is
just a looping LLM call + Memory + Tool usage. Use step-by-step
tutorial [4] to build an agent that "thinks" with an LLM, calls
external tools, remembers context, and keeps looping until it gets the
job done.

Follow along, get the satisfaction of seeing your first agent in
action [4], and iterate from there to build more complex,
enterprise-ready AI agents with Orkes.

 LARRY ELLISON, A MEDIA MOGUL LIKE NO OTHER (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Larry Ellison has become a media mogul whose portfolio and power
could exceed that of predecessors like Hearst and Pulitzer. Oracle is
among the investors in the new American version of TikTok, and Ellison
owns more than 40% of Oracle's stock and is its chief technology
officer. It is still unclear what the exact share of ownership will be
and who will run the new TikTok. The Ellison family recently secured
an $8 billion deal for Paramount and CBS, and it is reportedly
preparing a bid for Warner, which includes CNN. 

 ALTMAN, HUANG, AND THE LAST-MINUTE NEGOTIATIONS THAT SEALED THE $100
BILLION OPENAI-NVIDIA DEAL (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI and Nvidia are now more intimately linked than ever with a
monumental deal that will see Nvidia investing $100 billion into
OpenAI and providing cutting-edge processors to power a host of new
datacenters. The deal was negotiated largely through a mix of virtual
discussions and one-on-one meetings between Sam Altman and Jensen
Huang - no bankers were involved. Microsoft, OpenAI's principal
shareholder and primary cloud provider, was only notified about the
deal a day before it was signed. Nvidia and OpenAI's first gigawatt
site will go online in the back half of next year.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 HOW DO YOU USE A VIRTUAL CELL TO DO SOMETHING ACTUALLY USEFUL? (25
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Virtual cells are learned simulations of cells and cellular systems
that can be observed in varying conditions and changing contexts.
Computational simulations of cells can be useful for all sorts of
clinical and preclinical research. The field is still in its early
days, but in time, these models will become routine parts of
treatments. They will help patients avoid wasting precious time on
ineffective treatments and enable entirely new targets. 

 AI CHIPS ARE GETTING HOTTER. A MICROFLUIDICS BREAKTHROUGH GOES
STRAIGHT TO THE SILICON TO COOL UP TO THREE TIMES BETTER (13 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The chips used to run AI datacenters generate much more heat than
previous generations of silicon. Current cooling technology will
become a bottleneck to progress in just a few years. Microfluidics
could boost efficiency and improve sustainability for next-generation
AI chips. Microsoft has successfully developed an in-chip microfluidic
cooling system that can effectively cool a server running core
services for a simulated Teams meeting. The company's tests showed
that microfluidics performed up to three times better than cold plates
at removing heat. Advanced cooling technology would improve power
usage effectiveness and reduce operational costs.

 HOW GOOGLE'S DEV TOOLS MANAGER MAKES AI CODING WORK (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Ryan Salva, Google's project manager for developer tools, is
responsible for tools like Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist. His team
recently released new third-party research that showed how developers
actually use AI tools. This article contains an edited interview with
Salva where he talks about the research, how he uses AI tools, and the
future of IDEs. Salva believes that over time, the time spent in the
IDE will gradually shrink, and the job of the developer will start
looking more like an architect. 

 COMPILING PYTHON TO RUN ANYWHERE (23 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post looks at how Python can be pushed beyond its limits of
speed and portability to create a compiler that turns ordinary code
into fast, portable executables. The approach generates optimized
kernels while keeping the Python source unchanged. It demonstrates why
understanding systems at the lowest level matters.

 VCS TO AI STARTUPS: PLEASE TAKE OUR MONEY (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The fundraising script has flipped for a few dozen of the top AI
startups: VCs are pitching to them and presenting them with gifts and
favors in hopes of leading their next round. The best companies are
getting preempted every round, and the time between rounds is
shrinking. The surge in preemptive deals and soaring valuations has
kindled fears of an AI bubble. Some founders have been wary of
accepting offers as they risk pricing themselves out of future M&A
opportunities or locking themselves into aggressive growth
expectations if they raise cash at unsustainable levels. 

 TETHER CEO CONFIRMS MAJOR CAPITAL RAISE AT A REPORTED $500 BILLION
VALUATION (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Tether is looking to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion for a
roughly 3% stake through a select group of high-profile key investors.
The deal could put the company's value on par with OpenAI. It will
involve new equity rather than existing investors selling their
stakes. The talks are still in an early stage, so the details could
change.

sounds a lot like Buddhism or Eastern mysticism.
