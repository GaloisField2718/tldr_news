VACUUMS (15 MINUTE READ) [7]

without getting stuck on cables or toys. It processes things visually
instead of spatially, making it less prone to common robot vacuum
pitfalls. Mapping is all done on-device, so it doesn't require an
internet connection to run. The Matic is now available for preorder
with delivery planned for March next year. 

 IN A SURPRISING FINDING, LIGHT CAN MAKE WATER EVAPORATE WITHOUT HEAT
(7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have been puzzled for years over the fact that water held
in hydrogels evaporates at a significantly higher rate than could be
explained by the amount of heat that the water was receiving. New
research has concluded that under certain conditions, light can
directly bring about evaporation without heat at an even more
efficient rate than with heat. The phenomenon may play a role in the
formation and evolution of fog and clouds, so climate models will need
to consider the new factor to improve accuracy.
