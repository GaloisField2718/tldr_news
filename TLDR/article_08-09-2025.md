 TESLA PROPOSES MUSK PAY PACKAGE WORTH AS MUCH AS $1 TRILLION OVER
DECADE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla's board is asking investors to approve a pay package that could
deliver Elon Musk as much as $1 trillion in stock over the next
decade. The deal would allow Musk to receive installments of shares if
Tesla hits a series of market capitalization and business milestones.
The maximum payout would give him an additional 12% stake in Tesla,
but the company would have to reach a market value nearly eight times
its current valuation. The unprecedented pay package is aimed at
keeping Musk focused on the company. 

 EVERYTHING APPLE PLANS TO SHOW AT TUESDAY'S ‘AWE DROPPING' IPHONE
17 EVENT (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple plans to announce its next-generation iPhone lineup, new
smartwatches, and other peripherals at a product launch event
tomorrow. There will be four new iPhone models, including what will
likely be called the iPhone 17 Air, a model approximately one-third
thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro. It will have the same A19 processor as
the iPhone 17, but can only support eSIMs due to its thin frame. More
about what to expect from tomorrow's event is available in the
article.

 HOPE FOR DIABETES: CRISPR-EDITED CELLS PUMP OUT INSULIN IN A PERSON
– AND EVADE IMMUNE DETECTION (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sana Biotechnology, a firm in Seattle, Washington, has successfully
implanted CRISPR-edited pancreas cells into a person with type 1
diabetes without the need for immune-dampening drugs. The cells,
collected from a deceased donor, were able to produce insulin for
months. Currently, the only way for someone with type 1 diabetes to
avoid dependence on injected insulin is through the transplantation of
cadaveric islet cells, but this requires lifelong immune-suppressing
drug therapy. Sana's solution bypasses the need for those drugs
entirely. 

 ELON MUSK: NEURALINK COULD RESTORE PARTIAL VISION TO THE BLIND NEXT
YEAR (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Neuralink could attempt to restore limited sight to visually impaired
patients as early as 2026. Blindsight is a brain-computer interface
designed to restore vision. It targets the brain's visual cortex to
generate visual perception, which means that vision could be restored
even for people who were born blind. Blindsight has received a
'breakthrough device' designation from the US FDA.

for creating and manipulating images. This guide provides a
walkthrough on how to integrate the model into applications using the

 ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE STARTS ON EDGE (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The best engineering teams develop their own tools while running
production code on edge, where progress is made. When programmers are
able to directly influence the tools they're working with, they're
likely to do so, which makes them learn more. However, this requires
being able to immediately use the improvements or bug fixes they
helped devise - it doesn't work if they have to sit and wait for the
next release. Bug-free frameworks and libraries take work, but the
reward is increased engineering excellence.

 OPENAI BACKS AI-MADE ANIMATED FEATURE FILM (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Chad Nelson, a creative specialist at OpenAI, is making a
feature-length movie using AI. Expected to be released in theaters
globally next year, Critterz is a story about forest creatures who go
on an adventure after their village is disrupted by a stranger. Nelson
has teamed up with production companies in London and Los Angeles to
debut the film at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The team is
attempting to make the movie in about nine months instead of the three
years it would typically take. It has a budget of less than $30
million, far less than what animated films typically cost. 

 NO, AI IS NOT A BUBBLE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Bubbles are false beliefs about reality that everyone eventually
figures out were false. The dot-com bubble that popped was the idea
that businesses would become instantly rich just by being on the
internet. People no longer believe that just adding AI to products
will make them instant millionaires. The idea that modern AI will
significantly transform business and the global economy, leading to
massive unemployment for knowledge workers, is not a bubble.
