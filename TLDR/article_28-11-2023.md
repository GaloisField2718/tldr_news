 SHEIN FILES FOR U.S. IPO AS FAST-FASHION GIANT LOOKS TO EXPAND ITS
GLOBAL REACH (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Shein has filed to go public in the US. It could start trading on
public markets as soon as 2024. It is unclear how much the company is
currently worth, but it was last valued at $66 billion. Numerous
lawmakers have called on the SEC to ensure that Shein isn't using
forced labor in its supply chain before it's allowed to start trading
in the US.

 MEET STRANGE METALS: WHERE ELECTRICITY MAY FLOW WITHOUT ELECTRONS (9
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Some strange metals carry currents through them without electrons. A
new quantum phenomenon is likely responsible for electricity flow
within metals. Currents move more like liquids than a collective
movement of electrons when moving through these metals. Research is
starting to show that there is a different phase of matter within
these materials. 

 SOME THOUGHTS ON CAUSALITY IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It can be difficult to establish causality in biology. Adding to the
difficulty is the fact that something can be an important factor but
not a cause of a disease. In biology, 'X causes Y' tends to many 'X is
necessary and sufficient for Y'. We have to start thinking of systems
where we can talk about causation in a more realistic way to make
progress in biology.

 MY TODDLER LOVES PLANES, SO I BUILT HER A RADAR (28 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Jacob Bartlett's toddler loves looking at planes. There wasn't
anything out there that would allow them to just find planes in the
sky without having to understand and look at maps, so Bartlett decided
to make an app that could show nearby flights on a radar. This article
goes through the development process. It covers everything including
how they came up with the idea, specifications for the project, the
code, issues during development, and the publishing process.

 VITALIK BUTERIN'S TECHNO-OPTIMISM (72 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Vitalik Buterin believes in a future that is vastly brighter than the
present thanks to radically transformative technology. He rejects the
idea that we should keep the world roughly the same as today but be
less greedy with more public health care. Some technologies will
reliably make the world better than other types of technology - we
need active human intention to choose the directions that we want as
the best outcome will not be achieved automatically. 

 WHY DO COMPANIES HIRE PEOPLE TO BE IDLE A LOT OF THE TIME? (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Big Tech employs a lot of engineers, some of whom do very little.
Some say that companies do this to keep talent off the market, but
that might not be the case. Large projects sometimes require a lot of
people to be idle - even if they don't seem like they're doing
anything at the moment, they might play a critical role in the process
later. Prestige and budgets are also factors that can also lead to
idle engineers.
