TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck your software engineering team and
you're releasing slower because of it — you need QA Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[4] and helps them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [4] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 TESLA FULL SELF-DRIVING (FSD) V13 STARTS INITIAL ROLLOUT (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Tesla has started rolling out Tesla FSD V13 to customers. The latest
version of the advanced driver-assist system was released with
software update version 2024.39.10. The Cybercab units operating at
Tesla's 'We, Robot' event in October were supposed to be running
near-production AI software expected to ship in FSD V13, so the
expectations for the real-word performance of the update are pretty
high. The release notes for the update are available in the article. 

 META PLANS TO BUILD A $10B SUBSEA CABLE SPANNING THE WORLD, SOURCES
SAY (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta is the second-biggest driver of internet usage globally,
accounting for 10% of all fixed and 22% of all mobile traffic. The
company is planning to build a new major fiber-optic subsea cable
extending around the world. The 40,000+ kilometer project could cost
more than $10 billion. The project is still in its early stages -
plans have been laid out, but physical assets have not. Meta is
expected to speak more publicly about the project in early 2025 after
confirming plans for the cable.

 TESLA OPTIMUS SHOWS OFF NEW UPGRADE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tesla's Optimus has received new hands. They could theoretically be
used with Neuralink's N1 implant. The hands were revealed after Tesla
received approval for a new feasibility trial where it will test its
brain-to-computer implant with assistive robotic arms. A video showing
Optimus catching tennis balls with its new hands is available in the
article. 

 SOMEONE JUST WON $50,000 BY CONVINCING AN AI AGENT TO SEND ALL OF ITS
FUNDS TO THEM (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Freysa is an AI agent that was released with the sole objective of
never transferring money. Anyone was allowed to pay a fee to send a
message to the agent to convince it to release all its funds to them.
The cost for a message rose exponentially as the prize pool grew, with
70% of the message fees going into the prize pool and the developer
taking the rest. It took 483 attempts, with the message fee rising to
$450, to finally convince Freysa to release its funds. This post
contains an analysis of the winning prompt.

 THE MOST HATED WAY OF FIRING SOMEONE IS MORE POPULAR THAN EVER. IT'S
THE AGE OF THE PIP (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The use of performance improvement plans (PIPs) is on the rise. PIPs
usually list tough-to-achieve goals to be completed within 30 to 90
days. Failure to complete the tasks results in termination of
employment. They are intended to bring consistency and fairness to the
way employees are judged and managed, but both workers and managers
dread them. This post presents a guide to PIPs and how to navigate
them, as well as alternatives to the practice. One common tactic for
employees placed on PIPs is to file for a leave of absence, which
stops the clock on the PIP, allowing the employee to job hunt without
having to explain a resume gap to prospective new employers. 

 HOW LIBRA WAS KILLED (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Libra was an advanced, high-performance, payments-centric blockchain
paired with a stablecoin developed by Meta. The project was announced
in June 2019 but eventually killed off due to politics. Meta had
addressed every possible regulatory concern across financial crime,
money laundering, consumer protection, reserve management, buffers,
and much more. The project was killed through intimidation of captive
banking institutions.
