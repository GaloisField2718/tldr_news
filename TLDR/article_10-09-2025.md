 KEEP THIS STOCK ON YOUR WATCHLIST (SPONSOR) [4] 

 A young, private company is making waves in a $1.3 trillion real
estate industry. They even reserved the ticker PCSO. No wonder
investors are excited to invest in Pacaso's current growth round. [4]

Created by a former Zillow exec who sold his first venture for $120M
[4], Pacaso has already generated $1B+ worth of transactions and
associated service fees, earning $110M+ in gross profits to date. 

People are noticing, too. The same firms that backed Uber and Venmo
also backed Pacaso. Join them as a Pacaso shareholder before the
opportunity ends 9/18 [4].

 AI IS NOW A TOP-DOWN MANDATE. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE FUTURE OF

productivity.

 I LOVE UUID, I HATE UUID (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 UUIDv4 is simply a random number in a 122bit spectrum. UUIDv7 uses
its first 48 bits for the current time stamp, a few more bits for
version and variant, and 74 bits to store a random number. This means
that consecutive generations of UUIDv7s will sort one after the other.
This solves the index issue and makes it possible to know the insert
time of a row from within the primary key, which helps with debugging.
