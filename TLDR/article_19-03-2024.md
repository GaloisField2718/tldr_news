 APPLE‚ÄôS AI AMBITIONS COULD INCLUDE GOOGLE OR OPENAI (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Apple is reportedly actively negotiating with Google to bring
Gemini's generative AI technology to iOS. The company is aiming to
release AI features to customers later this year. These features will
likely be powered by a mix of first- and third-party AI models. While
Apple has been testing its own in-house models, its AI tech is said to
be less advanced than the competition. 

 NVIDIA CEO JENSEN HUANG ANNOUNCES NEW AI CHIPS: ‚ÄòWE NEED BIGGER
GPUS‚Äô (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nvidia announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips
and software for running AI models during its developer's conference
on Monday. The new Blackwell AI graphics processors are expected to
ship later this year. NIM is a software that makes it easier to deploy
AI. Nvidia aims to make all models runnable with all of its GPUs
through NIM. NIM will make it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for
inference, allowing companies to continue using the GPUs they already
own.

 A CHATGPT FOR MUSIC IS HERE (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Suno's AI model creates music from text prompts. The model creates
all the music itself while using OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate lyrics
and titles. Suno's newest model is still a few weeks from public
release. A link to an example of a track generated by the AI model is
available in the article. 

 A CARGO SHIP‚ÄôS ‚ÄòWINDWING‚Äô SAILS SAVED IT UP TO 12 TONS OF FUEL
PER DAY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Pyxis Ocean MC Shipping Kamsarmax vessel features a pair of
123-feet-tall solid 'wings' on top of its deck to harness wind power
for propulsion assistance. After six months of operation, results from
its journeys show that the technology offers a promising way to reduce
existing vessels' emissions. The ship reportedly saved an average of
3.3 tons of fuel each day - it saved over 12 tons a day during optimal
weather conditions. One potential issue with the adoption of the
technology is the extra 125 feet of height added by the wings as they
could complicate docking in many locations.

 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There will likely still be a market for software developers in the
foreseeable future. However, the nature of work will change and the
tools the industry uses may be very different from what it uses now.
This article presents several frameworks on how to think about the
future of software development in the context of recent AI
developments.

 A MONTH OF THE VISION PRO (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AR/VR/MR technology still hasn't reached the mass market yet - it is
still at the beginning of the S-Curve. The components in the Vision
Pro are still years away from fitting into a Quest 3's size, weight,
and price. The Vision Pro is effectively a very polished prototype or
a developer kit rather than a consumer product. While it is an
impressive piece of technology, there's not much that people can do
with it. The future of computing probably isn't more or bigger
screens. It may take a few years before the technology really takes
off.
