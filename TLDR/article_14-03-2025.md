 APPLE IS REPORTEDLY BRINGING LIVE TRANSLATION TO AIRPODS (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Apple is planning to bring live translation to AirPods in iOS 19. The
feature will allow users to hear a translated version of speech
through their AirPods - their iPhones will play a translation from its
speakers if the user responds. In addition to the feature, Apple plans
to overhaul the design of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS this year. It will
delay the release of its AI-upgraded Siri as it is taking longer than
expected to deliver. 

 NVIDIA'S NEXT CHIPS ARE NAMED AFTER VERA RUBIN, ASTRONOMER WHO
DISCOVERED DARK MATTER (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Most of Nvidia's most recent GPU architectures have been named after
famous women scientists. Its next critical AI chip platform will be
named after Vera Rubin, an American astronomer. Rubin discovered a lot
of what is known about dark matter. Nvidia has been naming its
architectures after scientists since 1998. It has never explained its
naming convention and hasn't emphasized the diversity aspect of its
choices, but its names are one of the most visible efforts in the tech
industry to honor diversity.

 ANTI-AGING ZEALOT BRYAN JOHNSON WANTS TO START ‘FOODOME SEQUENCING'
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bryan Johnson, the investor and founder behind the Don't Die
movement, wants to start testing as much food as possible to hold
brands accountable for unsafe food practices. One of the measures
Johnson takes to extend his life is to eat healthy, but he says that
eating healthy is not as easy as you'd think as it is hard to buy
clean food. Most foods could contain toxins from various processing
methods. Johnson plans to create a public database where people can
donate money to have certain foods and brands tested for toxins. 

 DWARF LEMURS COMBAT AGING DURING HIBERNATION BY REVERSING THEIR
CELLULAR CLOCKS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The fat-tailed dwarf lemur, a hamster-sized primate from Madagascar,
is the closest genetic relative to humans known to hibernate. They
tend to live longer than expected given their size. New research shows
that these small primates can reverse cellular aging. Telomeres in
hibernating lemurs grow longer - the lengthening may serve as a
protective mechanism against cell damage. Other mammals, including
humans, have also exhibited telomere lengthening in response to
extreme metabolic states. Understanding the mechanisms behind this
phenomenon could pave the way for the development of novel treatments
to slow or prevent age-related diseases.

 HTTP/3 IS EVERYWHERE BUT NOWHERE (25 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 HTTP/3 has been in development since at least 2016. While almost a
third of web traffic has been migrated to it already, neither HTTP/3
nor QUIC (the protocol beneath it) are included in the standard
libraries of any major languages. There are a rare few external
libraries for some languages, but all are experimental and/or
independent of other core networking APIs. Rollout of HTTP/3 has
barely started rolling out to any popular open source tools.
Underlying organizational differences are causing a split in
technologies on the Internet. The technology is great, but it's a
challenge if those benefits are not evenly distributed and only
accessible to a small set of organizations and their customers. 

 BEWARE TECH CAREER ADVICE FROM OLD HEADS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 People new to tech should take career advice from people who have
been in the industry for more than a decade with enormous skepticism.
The options available to people with established careers are
dramatically different from what newcomers experience. These
differences are so huge that newcomers and experienced workers might
as well be in totally different industries. The tech industry of 15 or
20 years ago was very different from today.

 META IS LAUNCHING COMMUNITY NOTES IN THE US NEXT WEEK (5 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Meta is releasing its version of Community Notes for its apps for
users in the US on March 18. The program will copy a crowdsourced
fact-checking system Twitter unveiled in 2021. Meta says it will focus
on getting the feature right in the US before it rolls out to other
countries. It may be hesitant to roll out the feature in the EU, where
the European Commission is currently investigating X over the
effectiveness of its version of Community Notes.
