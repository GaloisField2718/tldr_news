 GOOGLE‚ÄôS GEMINI PRO BEATS GPT-4 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's Gemini Pro has claimed the second position in HuggingFace's
Chat Bot Arena Leaderboard. Gemini Pro is Google's second-best model -
Gemini Ultra's capabilities have yet to be revealed. OpenAI risks
losing its lead if it fails to introduce a new model soon. Google is
integrating a 'Help me Write' feature directly into Google Chrome to
reduce the need for users to draft content on other AI platforms. 

 APPLE‚ÄôS PLANS FOR THE DMA IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (26 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Apple has announced a broad, wide-ranging, and complex set of new
policies regarding its intended compliance with the EU's Digital
Markets Act (DMA). This article looks at Apple's proposed changes.
Anti-big-business regulation and pro-consumer results often go
hand-in-hand, but the DMA exposes issues with these types of
regulations. The DMA will likely not change much for the better for
iOS users in the EU. Its practical effects will likely make things
worse for users.

 A NEW AI MODEL CALLED MORPHEUS-1 CLAIMS TO INDUCE LUCID DREAMING (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Prophetic, a neurotechnology startup, has a new AI model called
Morpheus-1 that it claims can help people enter a lucid dream state.
The model takes the current brain state as a prompt and generates
ultrasound holograms that can be sent to the brain to start the lucid
dream state and keep it stable. Lucid dreaming is a type of dream
state where the dreamer is aware they are asleep and can control the
dream. Prophetic plans to release a headband product called The Halo
in beta in the Spring. The device sends sound waves into the brain to
connect with the current brain state and put the mind into a lucid
state. 

 THE ROOFTOP SOLAR INDUSTRY COULD BE ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE (11
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Solar panel salespeople obscuring the specific terms of financial
agreements and clouding the value of their products are causing a
storm in the solar panel industry. Law firms across the US are
claiming to receive multiple calls every week from potential clients
with stories of dodgy salespeople causing them to sign up for deals
that they can't afford. Some of the nation's biggest public solar
companies are struggling to stay afloat as questions arise over the
viability of the financial products they sold to both customers and
investors. These factors could topple the residential solar industry:
more than 100 solar dealers and installers in the US declared
bankruptcy in late 2023 alone.

 SIMON WILLISON INTERVIEW: AI SOFTWARE STILL NEEDS THE HUMAN TOUCH (16
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article features an interview with Simon Willison, one of the
co-creators of the Django framework, where he discusses AI, software
development, intellectual property, and related matters. In the
discussion about intellectual property, Willison acknowledges how some
activities can be legal and still be morally wrong, like how models
can be trained on creators' content and then used to compete against
the original creators. The issues he discusses are complex, but
Willison takes the time to explain them in detail. 

 ASK HN: THOSE WHO'VE JOINED A FRIEND'S STARTUP AS AN EMPLOYEE, HOW
DID THAT GO? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [13] 

 The dynamics of joining a friend's startup as an employee aren't
widely discussed. This Hacker News thread provides many personal
anecdotes of what the experience is like. While some people report
positive experiences, many replies tell the story of how the decision
to work at a friend's startup ultimately cost them the friendship.
Working with friends may be more enjoyable, but the decision to join a
startup should be based on the startup itself rather than the
friendship - is the opportunity good, does it progress your career,
does it pay you well, and is the equity fair?
