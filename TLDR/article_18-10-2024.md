 BEHIND THE SCENES: HOW AI IS RESHAPING GOOGLE (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google has decided to reshuffle some of its departments to further
speed up its AI development. The first part of this change involves
the Gemini app team being absorbed by DeepMind. Another big change
involves the Assistant teams moving to Platforms and Devices.
Prabhakar Raghavan, SVP of search and ads, is changing roles to become
Google's chief technologist. Nick Fox, who was a part of Raghavan's
leadership team, will be taking over Raghavan's old position and be in
charge of Search, Ads, Geo, and Commerce products. 

 MICROSOFT AND OPENAI'S CLOSE PARTNERSHIP SHOWS SIGNS OF FRAYING (7
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ties between Microsoft and OpenAI have started to fray. The
partnership has been strained by financial pressure on OpenAI, concern
about OpenAI's stability, and disagreements between employees of the
two companies. OpenAI has been trying to renegotiate its deal with
Microsoft to help it secure more computing power and reduce expenses,
but Microsoft executives have grown concerned that the company's AI
work is too dependent on OpenAI. Microsoft has started to hedge its
bet on OpenAI by building its own technologies.

 SCIENTISTS CLAIM BREAKTHROUGH TO BRINGING BACK TASMANIAN TIGER FROM
EXTINCTION (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas-based company, claims to have
extracted a thylacine DNA sequence that is 99.9% the same as the
original from a 108-year-old specimen preserved in alcohol at a museum
in Melbourne, Australia. The company aims to eventually bring back the
thylacine, along with other species, back from extinction. While some
argue that it is unethical to return long-extinct animals to habitats
degraded by human activity, the company's research has produced
beneficial advances that can be applied across current living animals.
Its efforts could help protect threatened species. 

 SAM ALTMAN'S WORLDCOIN BECOMES WORLD AND SHOWS NEW IRIS-SCANNING ORB
TO PROVE YOUR HUMANITY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sam Altman's Worldcoin crypto project has changed its name to just
'World', potentially signaling the project's interest in expanding its
identity beyond its original cryptocurrency mission. Tools for
Humanity, the startup behind the project, has unveiled the next
generation of its iris-scanning 'Orb' and other tools. The new Orb is
easier to mass-produce, has fewer parts, and operates three times
faster than the previous version. One of the new tools is called Deep
Face - it is an attempt to combat online deepfakes and impersonation
using Tools for Humanity's human-verification services.

 OUR CLOUD-EXIT SAVINGS WILL NOW TOP TEN MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 37signals brought its cloud bill down from $3.2 million a year to
$1.3 million by pulling seven cloud apps out of AWS and into its own
hardware. Its expenditure on all new hardware has been entirely
recouped. Most of the $1.3 million spend is still on AWS S3 - the
company's cloud storage contract doesn't expire until next summer and
it plans to stop using AWS when the contract expires. Moving
completely away from AWS is expected to save the company another $4
million over five years. 

 VIDEO SCRAPING: EXTRACTING JSON DATA FROM A 35 SECOND SCREEN CAPTURE
FOR LESS THAN 1/10TH OF A CENT (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 It's possible to record a screen capture of a browsing session and
then use Google Gemini to extract numbers from the video. While these
language models shouldn't be trusted not to make mistakes, it appears
that the Gemini 1.5 Flash 002 model is sufficient enough to complete
the task consistently. Extracting data from a 35-second video costs
less than a tenth of a cent. Video scraping allows developers to have
total control over what is exposed to the AI model. This article walks
readers through how to do it.

 AMAZON AWS CEO: QUIT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RETURN TO OFFICE (2 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 AWS CEO Matt Garman suggested during an all-hands meeting for AWS on
Thursday that employees who did not wish to work for Amazon in-office
five days a week should quit. He claimed that nine out of ten workers
he had spoken with supported the new 5-day-per-week in-office policy,
which takes effect in January. Many Amazon employees have said that
the new policy will waste time with additional commuting and that the
benefits of working from the office are not supported by independent
data. Garman says that it's too hard to accomplish company goals with
the current mandatory three days of in-office work. 

 META FIRES STAFF FOR ‘USING FREE MEAL VOUCHERS TO BUY HOUSEHOLD
GOODS' (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Meta has reportedly fired about 24 staff at its Los Angeles offices
for using their meal credits to buy household goods. Meta usually
feeds staff for free from canteens at its larger offices, but those at
smaller sites are given daily credits to order food through delivery
services. Some workers were found to be abusing the system, including
sending food home when they were not in the office. Employees who had
only occasionally broken the rules were reprimanded but were able to
keep their jobs.
