 WAYMO SAYS IT HAS DOUBLED ITS WEEKLY PAID ROBOTAXI TRIPS TO 100,000
SINCE MAY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Waymo is now providing more than 100,000 paid robotaxi rides per week
in the US. It serves the most trips in San Francisco. The company
claims that its driverless vehicles have driven over 14.8 million
rider-only miles. It also claims that the Waymo Driver is 3.5 times
better at avoiding crashes that cause injuries and 3 times better at
avoiding police-reported crashes than human drivers. 

 OPENAI'S MOST ADVANCED MODEL CAN NOW BE CUSTOMIZED. HERE'S HOW (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini can now be fine-tuned and customized
by developers for business use. Developers can now use their own
datasets to enhance the model's knowledge base with proprietary
information and control how the model responds to specific questions.
It costs $25 for every 1 million tokens used to fine-tune GPT-4o - $3
for GPT-4o mini. 1 million tokens is roughly equivalent to 2,500 pages
in a standard-size book.

 WATCH THIS ROBOT QUICKLY INSTALL ROOF SHINGLES (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Renovate Robotics' Rufus V1 rooftop robot can automate one of
construction's most common and dangerous tasks - roofing. The robot
can currently only install shingles, but future versions will be able
to rip them out and perform solar installs. It is designed for large
roofs and works on slopes up to 12:12, helping contractors maximize
their productivity. A video showing the robot in action is available
in the article. 

 AGAINST ALL ODDS, AN ASTEROID MINING COMPANY APPEARS TO BE MAKING
HEADWAY (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AstroForge recently announced that it successfully raised $40 million
in Series A funding. The company aims to mine asteroids for platinum
and other precious metals. It is working to launch a spacecraft in the
fourth quarter of this year that will attempt to fly by a near-Earth,
metallic-rich asteroid while capturing images and taking data. The
company has planned a follow-up mission that involves a larger
spacecraft docking with the targeted metallic asteroid using magnets.

 EFFECTIVE CHANGELOGS (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Changelogs are a vital and often overlooked method of communication.
This post discusses how to write a great changelog. It covers the
basics (you need to at least have a changelog file), formatting,
writing style, and more. A full example is provided at the end of the
post. 

 AN UNDERRATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERVIEW QUESTION (8 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 The bug squash interview involves asking candidates to find a bug and
maybe write code to fix it. It is very effective because it reflects
everyday software development, it's easy for the candidate to
self-assess their own progress, it's difficult to cheat, and
candidates who are good at it are good at it because they have
practiced debugging day in and day out their entire career. The bug
squash interview tests a skill rarely covered by existing interview
loops. It's also fun to do.

 NORTH AMERICA ADDED A WHOLE SILICON VALLEY'S WORTH OF DATA CENTER
INVENTORY THIS YEAR. IT'S NOT ENOUGH (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The eight primary data center markets in North America added 515
megawatts (MW) of new supply in the first half of this year. All of
Silicon Valley has 459 MW of data center supply. Data center space
under construction is currently at a record high. The vast majority is
already leased. The insane amounts of data center capacity being built
are still not enough to meet the growing demands of cloud computing
and artificial intelligence providers. This demand has raised national
rental rates by 6.5% on average. 

 YOUR TV SET HAS BECOME A DIGITAL BILLBOARD. AND IT'S ONLY GETTING
WORSE (21 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Rather than selling as many TVs as possible, TV manufacturers are
increasingly seeking recurring revenue from already-sold TVs via ad
sales and tracking. Some brands already prioritize data collection and
the ability to sell ads and most are trying to boost their appeal to
advertisers. Smart TV OS providers are generating revenue by licensing
their software and through revenue sharing of in-app purchases and
subscriptions. Budget TVs are the leaders in this trend as companies
often offset cheap hardware prices with ads and data collection.

 CODEBASES ARE UNIQUELY HARD TO SEARCH SEMANTICALLY (6 MINUTE READ)
