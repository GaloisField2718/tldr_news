 AMAZON'S SILENT SACKING (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Many teams at Amazon have been in a hiring freeze for over a year and
the employees that were left after the layoffs in 2023 are now
leaving. The changes in the organization will likely result in a major
AWS outage in 2024. There has already been an increase in large-scale
events throughout Amazon. While Amazon is operationally strong, these
operational practices depend on people, and when people are eliminated
to increase stock prices, operational practices suffer. 

 MICROSOFT‚ÄôS COPILOT APP IS NOW AVAILABLE ON IOS (1 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Microsoft has rolled out its Copilot AI chatbot app for iOS and
iPadOS. The app allows users to access GPT-4 without paying for a
subscription and ask questions, draft emails, summarize text, and
create images. Microsoft's rebrand of Bing Chat to Copilot shows that
the company is moving towards offering a standalone experience similar
to ChatGPT. There is also a web experience for Copilot that is
separate from Bing.

 THESE MOLECULAR JACKHAMMERS TAKE ON CANCER CELLS IN THE LAB, KILLS
99% (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scientists have discovered a way to combat cancer cells using
vibrating molecules. The molecules vibrate synchronously to rupture
the membranes of cancer cells. They are activated with near-infrared
light, which allows for deeper penetration into the body than visible
light. The technique demonstrated 99% efficacy in destroying cultured
cancer cells in laboratory tests. When tested on mice models, half of
the animals became cancer-free. 

 WE ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE GOLDEN AGE OF GENE THERAPY (11 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The first CRISPR-based gene therapies were approved in the UK and the
US late last year. While gene therapies promise to tackle both rare
and common diseases, they will come with side effects like exorbitant
prices, barriers to access, and ethical concerns. This article looks
at how the field promises to bring better editing with more targets
and equitable therapies for all in 2024 and beyond.

 STUFF WE FIGURED OUT ABOUT AI IN 2023 (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article attempts to round up the highlights in AI development
over 2023. It covers how to run LLMs on personal devices, fine-tuning
models, the problem of gullibility, LLM applications, and more. LLMs
can provide people who use them effectively with a significant boost
to their quality of life. They're actually quite easy to build, but
there's still a lot unknown about them and they're still unreliable
for many applications. There are still many legal and ethical problems
to overcome in the space.
