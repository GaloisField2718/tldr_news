 😘 KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. But getting that kind of coverage—and staying there—is
hard and pricey for any size team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native service SUPPORTS WEB AND MOBILE APPS,
delivering 80% automated test coverage in weeks [6] and helping teams
SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles to minutes.

With QA Wolf, you get:

✅ Unlimited parallel test runs

✅ 15-min QA cycles

✅ 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation

✅ Zero-flake guarantee

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] saw 4x more test cases
and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 META HAS FINALLY LAUNCHED ITS CHATGPT COMPETITOR (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meta has launched Meta AI, a standalone AI app built on the company's
latest Llama 4 model. Its standout feature is the Discover feed, which
lets users see how their connections use Meta AI. Users have full
control over what gets shared, but opting out of having user data
scraped to train Meta's AI is nearly impossible. The app is designed
to pair with Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses - users can start a
conversation via voice through the glasses and then continue in the
app or web interface later. 

 WAYMO, TOYOTA STRIKE PARTNERSHIP TO BRING SELF-DRIVING TECH TO
PERSONAL VEHICLES (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Waymo and Toyota have announced a preliminary partnership to explore
bringing robotaxi technology to personally-owned vehicles. The
partnership could result in Waymo incorporating Toyota's vehicles into
its ride-hailing fleet. Waymo has previously worked with many other
automakers, but most of these partnerships only resulted in the
companies producing modified vehicles for testing or for Waymo to use
in its fleets. The company now serves 250,000 paid rides per week
through its commercial driverless ride-hailing services in the San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin regions.

 TESLA POWERWALL 3 IS DISRUPTING THE SOLAR INVERTER MARKET (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Tesla was the most quoted battery brand in the second half of last
year. It was also the second-most quoted inverter brand - its
Powerwall 3 includes an integrated inverter that works for both solar
and storage applications. Tesla's growth is lowering storage and solar
prices. It is unclear whether brand backlash or equipment shortages
will affect Tesla's marketplace share this year. 

 INTEL'S NEXT CHIP NODE, 14A, TO BOOST CPU SPEEDS WITH 'TURBO CELLS'
(4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Intel's 14A chip node will feature a mysterious 'turbo cell'
technology designed to boost CPU and GPU speeds. It will offer a 15%
to 20% performance-per-watt increase over the 18A process. The 14A
process will arrive in 2027 alongside a '14-E' node developed to
contain additional feature extensions. The company is also currently
developing another node called 18A-P, scheduled to arrive next year,
designed to deliver enhanced performance to a broader set of foundry
customers.

 META PREVIEWS AN API FOR ITS LLAMA AI MODELS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Meta's Llama API is now available in a limited preview. The API
allows developers to build Llama-driven services, tools, and
applications. It comes with an evaluation suite for testing the
quality of custom models. Meta says it won't use customer data from
the API to train its models. Models built using the Llama API can be
transferred to another host. Access to the API will be expanded in the
coming weeks and months. 

 I USE ZIP BOMBS TO PROTECT MY SERVER (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While most bots are just trying to discover new content, there are
some created to spam, scrape content, or hack - one way to deal with
these bots is by using zip bombs. A zip bomb is a relatively small
compressed file that can expand into a very large file that can
overwhelm a machine. This post walks readers through how to create a
zip bomb to prevent malicious bots from accessing their servers. While
zip bombs can be easily detected and circumvented, they are good
enough for protecting servers from unsophisticated bots.

 ALTMAN AND NADELLA, WHO IGNITED THE MODERN AI BOOM TOGETHER, ARE
DRIFTING APART (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft has become strained.
The companies' chief executive officers are increasingly at odds over
the computing power Microsoft provides to OpenAI, the access OpenAI
gives Microsoft to its models, and whether OpenAI's AI systems will
soon achieve humanlike intelligence. The companies wield tremendous
power over one another: Microsoft can effectively block OpenAI's
effort to restructure into an independent for-profit company, and
OpenAI's board can prevent Microsoft from accessing its most
cutting-edge technology. While they helped each other become power
players in generative AI, they are now preparing for independent
futures. 

 ASK HN: AI REPLACING ENGINEERS – FIRSTHAND STORIES? (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [17] 

 There are many stories about companies replacing human engineers with
AI. This thread contains responses from real engineers that discuss
the current industry landscape. While there is a lot of hype about AI,
much of it is built on a misunderstanding of what real engineering
work is. Most of an engineer's time is spent thinking and talking
about the problem and solutions, not coding. The hard part of software
engineering isn't making new code - a large portion of the work is
dealing with people, understanding what they really want or need, and
helping them understand it.

MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Apple chose not to include rsync 3.x in macOS due to licensing

what rsync does - those who need to have the 3.x version of rsync can
install it via Homebrew.
