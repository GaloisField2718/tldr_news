READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August and it expects
about $3.7 billion in annual sales this year. However, it expects to
lose roughly $5 billion after paying for costs related to running its
services. There will also be other costs such as equity-based
compensation to employees. Its biggest cost is the computing power it
gets through a partnership with Microsoft. OpenAI plans to raise
ChatGPT Plus to $44 over the next five years.

CODE FOR HUMANS (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Writing code that other humans interact with, like frameworks,
libraries, APIs, SDKs, and programming languages, is difficult because
developers need to grapple with other users' mental models of their

 WHEN TO DO WHAT YOU LOVE (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 There's a lot of selection bias in advice about whether to follow
your passion. Most people telling you to follow your passion became
successful by doing what they're most interested in. One of the
requirements for doing great work is that the person is working on
what interests them most. Not everyone can do or wants to do great
work. However, the root of great work is a sort of ambitious curiosity
which can't be manufactured. 

 THE MESSY WORDPRESS DRAMA, EXPLAINED (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg last week came out with a harsh
attack on major WordPress hosting provider WP Engine, calling the
company a 'cancer' to the community. This has escalated into a barrage
of legal threats that has caught many website operators in a conflict
beyond their control. WP Engine customers were off from accessing
WordPress.org's servers, but the company has been granted a temporary
reprieve. WP Engine claims that Automattic demanded a very large sum
of money days before Mullenweg's attack and threatened to carry out a
'scorched earth nuclear approach' toward WP Engine if the amount
wasn't received. Many more details about the situation are available
in the article.
