 OPENAI HITS $10 BILLION IN ANNUAL RECURRING REVENUE FUELED BY CHATGPT
GROWTH (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI has hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The
figure includes sales from the company's consumer products, ChatGPT
business products, and OpenAI's API, but excludes licensing revenue
from Microsoft and large one-time deals. OpenAI had around $5.5
billion in ARR last year - it is targeting $125 billion in revenue by
2029. The company currently supports 500 million weekly active users,
with three million paying business users.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 DOCTORS COULD HACK THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WITH ULTRASOUND (12 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Focused ultrasound stimulation (FUS) is a technique that involves
using sound waves to reduce inflammation in targeted areas of the
body. It could help with many disorders, including diabetes, obesity,
arthritis, heart disease, and certain cancers. The technology offers a
precise and safe way to provide healing treatments for a wide range of
both acute and chronic maladies - without surgery, and potentially at
home with a wearable device. This article discusses in-depth how FUS
works and its potential applications. 

 XROBOTICS' COUNTERTOP ROBOTS ARE COOKING UP 25,000 PIZZAS A MONTH (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 XRobotics' countertop robot, xPizza Cube, can make up to 100 pizzas
an hour. Roughly the size of a stackable washing machine, the xPizza
Cube can be retrofitted to work with pies of different sizes and
styles. A unit can be leased for $1,300 a month for three years.
XRobotics recently raised a $2.5 million seed round - it will use the
capital to produce more units and install more robots for customers.

 MAKING SENSE OF AGENTIC AI ORCHESTRATION — AND WHY GOVERNANCE MIGHT
BE THE MISSING PIECE (SPONSOR) [13] 

 AI agents can be productivity multipliers, but oversight is still
messy. And when multiple agents work together without proper
orchestration, you get autonomous chaos. Camunda's free webinar (June
24) [13] shows how to coordinate AI agents while maintaining control,
including real examples of balancing agent autonomy with compliance
requirements. Sign up to join live [13] 

 APPLE ANNOUNCES FOUNDATION MODELS FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPERS TO
LEVERAGE AI (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Apple's Foundation Models Framework is a new API that allows
third-party developers to build apps that leverage Apple's on-device
large language models. It enables developers to build AI-powered
features that work offline, protect privacy, and incur no inference
costs. The framework is available for testing starting today through
the Apple Developer Program. A public beta will be available through
the Apple Beta Software Program next month. 

 CONTAINER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 container is a tool for creating and running Linux containers as
lightweight virtual machines on macOS. It consumes and produces
OCI-compliant container images, so developers can pull and run images
from any standard container registry. Developers can also push images
to those registries, and run the images in any other OCI-compliant
application. container is optimized for Apple silicon.

 LLMS ARE CHEAP (16 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Generative AI is relatively cheap, especially when compared to search
APIs. While inference was very expensive at the start of the AI boom,
it has since gotten a lot cheaper. The real cost problem will be from
the backend services that AI agents will want to access. 

 ONE MAN ARMIES (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This post contains a list of one-person (or mostly one-person)
projects. The list includes Stardew Valley, Linux, the first
scientific map of the Atlantic Ocean, Rollercoaster Tycoon, and
jQuery. Each entry names the project's creator. The list shows how
incredible things can be made by a single person. If you care enough
about your ideas, they might be worth trying.
