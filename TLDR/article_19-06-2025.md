 😘 KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. But getting that kind of coverage — and staying there —
is hard and pricey for any sized team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native service gets web and mobile apps to 80%
automated test coverage in less than 4 months.

They create and maintain your test suite in open-source Playwright.
Plus, they provide unlimited parallel test runs [6] on their
infrastructure (24-hour maintenance included).

The result? Salesloft saves $750k/year [7] in QA engineering +
executes 300+ tests in parallel on every PR in minutes.

⭐ Rated 4.8/5 on G2. Trusted by Cohere, AutoTrader, Mailchimp, and
many others.

 WAYMO WANTS TO BRING ITS ROBOTAXIS TO NEW YORK CITY (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Waymo plans to return to New York City next month to do more mapping
as well as testing. However, its vehicles will be driven by humans.
New York state law doesn't allow for vehicles to operate without a
person at the wheel, but Waymo is pushing for changes to the law.
Waymo's taxis have surged in popularity in other cities - the company
now provides more than 250,000 autonomous trips each week.

Hayward, California, near the company's Foster City headquarters. The
new factory will be used for engineering, software and hardware
integration, assembly, storage, and testing. Zoox expects to one day

 THE UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVENESS OF FUZZING FOR PORTING PROGRAMS (22
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 One way to port a codebase from C to Rust is to have large language
models write fuzz tests and build the port in topological order. This
blog post discusses how. While the overall system seems to work, there
are some downsides - for example, the resulting Rust code is very
'C-like'. Full automation is difficult, but it may not be completely
necessary as humans can still be used to fix issues as they emerge.

 Microsoft plans to lay off several thousand employees around the
beginning of the company's new fiscal year, which starts in July. The
job cuts will affect sales and other teams. The number of cuts has not

 THE GREAT DECOUPLING (OR WHY YOUR CLICKS ARE DOWN AND IMPRESSIONS UP)
(4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google's AI Overviews creates two opportunities for top-ranking
content to log impressions for a given keyword: once as a blue link
and again as a citation in an AI Overview. Citations seem to be pulled
from content that already ranks highly in traditional search results.
Clicks are decreasing because AI Overviews are increasing zero-click
searches - many searchers are able to resolve their queries now
without leaving the search results page. However, it's not all doom
and gloom: visits from AI search convert 23 times better than visits
from traditional search.
