TLDR 2025-11-24

 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native solution provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA
cycle to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks [6]—not years
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs [7]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of engineers [8] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

 APPLE IOS 27 TO BE NO-FRILLS ‘SNOW LEOPARD' UPDATE, OTHER THAN NEW
AI (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 iOS 27 will be focused on improving software quality and underlying
performance. Many users have reported bugs in iOS 26, including device
overheating, unexplained battery drain, user interface glitches,
keyboard failures, cellular connectivity issues, app crashes, and
sluggishness during system navigation and animations. iOS 27 will also
lay the foundations for foldable iPhones and other new hardware. In
general, Apple's operating systems next year will revolve mostly
around performance and AI. 

 GOOGLE MUST DOUBLE AI SERVING CAPACITY EVERY 6 MONTHS TO MEET DEMAND,
AI INFRASTRUCTURE BOSS TELLS EMPLOYEES (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google aims to be able to deliver over a thousand times more
capability, compute, and storage for essentially the same cost, power,
and energy level in the next five years. This will require it to
double its serving capacity every six months. Google, Microsoft,
Amazon, and Meta are now expected to collectively spend more than $380
billion on infrastructure this year. Besides infrastructure
build-outs, Google plans to bolster its capacity with more efficient
models and custom silicon.

 AI TRAINED ON BACTERIAL GENOMES PRODUCES NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN PROTEINS
(6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Evo is a genomic language model developed using an enormous
collection of bacterial genomes. It can generate novel sequences from
prompts. Evo can produce outputs that include regions that encode
proteins with related functions when prompted with a gene. It appears
to be capable of outputting entirely new yet functional proteins. 

 WE INDUCED SMELLS WITH ULTRASOUND (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Smells are processed in the olfactory bulb, which is tucked behind
the top of the nose. Scientists have managed to use ultrasound
targeted at the olfactory bulb to induce the sensation of fresh air
and ozone and the smell of garbage and burning wood. Smells are strong
and localized to the nose, while sensations are more diffuse, like a
light tingling on the face. The scientists plan to improve their
technique to significantly increase the bit rate of olfactory
stimulation.

 WE STOPPED ROADMAP WORK FOR A WEEK AND FIXED 189 BUGS (12 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Once a quarter, the team at Google working on Perfetto, an open
source suite of tools for performance tracing and analysis, stops all
regular work for a week and fixes the small things that have been
annoying them or their users. The most recent 'fixit', in which 40
people participated, resolved 189 bugs. Fixits are a great chance to
work on the details that separate good products from great ones. They
increase team morale and spirit and create real momentum. This post
contains a guide on how to run a fixit. 

 KIT (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 kit is a toolkit for codebase mapping, symbol extraction, code
search, and building LLM-powered developer tools, agents, and
workflows. It can build things like code reviewers, code generators,
and IDEs. kit can be used directly with Python, MCP with function
calling, REST, or through the command-line. kit ships with CLI-based
pull request review and summarization features. It can generate
intelligent commit messages from staged changes.

 COMPANIES PREDICT 2026 WILL BE THE WORST COLLEGE GRAD JOB MARKET IN
FIVE YEARS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Next Spring's graduate-hiring market is likely going to be even worse
than this year's. This is the most pessimistic outlook since the first
year of the pandemic. Companies say that an uncertain economic outlook
has pushed them to hire more conservatively, and many are giving
priority to prospects with experience rather than fresh graduates.
People with experience are currently willing to take entry-level
positions because they can't find anything else, pushing out those
with less training. 

 WORK, WOODLANDS, AND GEOCACHES (14 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Your job will always want more from you. However, you only have so
much time for everything in life. You don't have to quit your job, but
you should add more to life - like hobbies, small adventures, and acts
of service. Doing this allows work to stop being the whole story. Work
also becomes more relaxing because you know you have other things to
live for.
