 3 THINGS VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS LOOK FOR (SPONSOR) [4] 

 For VCs, the best investments check three boxes: a massive market, a
clear pain point, and founder-market fit. 

No wonder prominent firms like Maveron backed Pacaso.

In the $1.3 trillion vacation home market, second homes were either
too expensive or too much hassle. So after successfully exiting his
previous business, a proven real estate founder applied his proptech
expertise [4], selling fractions of homes and managing everything
through streamlined tech. 

That approach has earned Pacaso $110m+ in gross profits to date,
including 41% YoY growth last year alone, across 2,000+ happy
homeowners.

Join major VCs like Greycroft as a Pacaso investor for just
$2.90/share.

 ALPHABET'S ISOMORPHIC LABS HAS GRAND AMBITIONS TO ‘SOLVE ALL
DISEASES' WITH AI. NOW, IT'S GEARING UP FOR ITS FIRST HUMAN TRIALS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Isomorphic Labs, Alphabet's secretive drug discovery arm, is
preparing to launch human trials of AI-designed drugs. The company was
born from one of DeepMind's most celebrated breakthroughs, AlphaFold,
an AI system capable of predicting protein structures and interactions
with a high level of accuracy. The system has helped researchers
design medicines faster and more precisely. 

 JACK DORSEY LAUNCHES A WHATSAPP MESSAGING RIVAL BUILT ON BLUETOOTH (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bitchat is a decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging app that works
entirely over Bluetooth mesh networks - no internet, central servers,
phone numbers, or emails required. It enables ephemeral, encrypted
communication - nearby devices form clusters and pass messages from
device to device, allowing them to reach peers beyond standard range,
even without Wi-Fi or cell service. Messages are stored only
on-device, disappear by default, and never touch centralized
infrastructure. A beta version of Bitchat is currently live on
TestFlight.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 CREATING THERAPEUTIC ABUNDANCE (22 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The invention of new medicines is limited by our knowledge of cells
and molecules that can be manipulated to treat disease. The cost of
discovering new medicines is increasing. New technologies have the
potential to unlock an era of target abundance and reverse the long
decline in research and development productivity. This could be one of
AI's most important impacts. 

 NUCLEAR REACTORS SMALLER THAN A SEMI TRUCK TO BE TESTED IN IDAHO (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The US Department of Energy (DoE) has conditionally selected
Westinghouse's trailer-sized eVinci test reactor and Radiant's
Kaleidos unit to conduct the first fueled microreactor experiments at
its Demonstration of Microreactor Experiments (DOME) facility at Idaho
National Laboratory. The DOME project considers anything under 50 MW
of power to be a microreactor - the eVinci is designed to produce 5
megawatts, and the Kaleidos can output 1.2 megawatts. The DoE hopes
that microreactors can be used to power small, remote sites. DOME is
designed to be up and running by early 2026. It will operate one
experiment at a time for six months.

 HANDLING UNIQUE INDEXES ON LARGE DATA IN POSTGRESQL (10 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 PostgreSQL has a limitation on unique index entries larger than 1/3
of a buffer page. The 1/3 page size limit exists to ensure efficient
page splitting. To overcome the restriction, introduce a new field
that stores a hash of the large field. This allows you to store really
large data inside databases, even with unique constraints. 

 ADDING A FEATURE BECAUSE CHATGPT INCORRECTLY THINKS IT EXISTS (5
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Soundslice is a service that scans sheet music from photographs so
users can listen, edit, and practice. Over the past few months, the
team at Soundslice started noticing that their error logs were full of
ASCII tablature, a way of notating music for guitar that the service
didn't support. The team discovered that ChatGPT was hallucinating
instructions to users and telling them to go to Soundslice and use a
feature that didn't exist. Instead of posting a notice telling users
that ChatGPT was incorrect, the team decided to build the feature
instead.

 WHY I USED TO PREFER PERMISSIVE LICENSES AND NOW FAVOR COPYLEFT (10
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Free open source software is usually published under one of two major
categories of copyright licenses: permissive licenses, which freely
share with everyone, or copyleft licenses, which freely share only
with those who are also willing to freely share. Copyleft creates a
large pool of code that developers can only legally use if they are
willing to share the source code of anything they build on it, making
it a very broad-based and neutral way of incentivizing more diffusion.
It does not favor specific actors nor create roles for active
parameter setting by central planners. 

 THE BROKEN MICROSOFT PACT: LAYOFFS AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT (9
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 There are stories of people who have been with Microsoft for 20
years, who grew up with the company, and who never had to worry about
sudden changes. While the performance management system had its
quirks, there was an understanding that if you did solid work, you'd
have a place. Workers at Microsoft received below-market-rate pay in
exchange for stability, a reasonable work-life balance, and the
promise of no layoffs - this is no longer the case. This shift was
almost expected: Microsoft's performance management challenges made
layoffs a more attractive option than addressing individual
performance issues systematically.
