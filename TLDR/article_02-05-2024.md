 AIRBNB'S ICONS ALLOW YOU TO DRIFT OFF IN THE ‚ÄòUP' HOUSE OR REST IN
PRINCE'S ‚ÄòPURPLE RAIN' MANSION (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Airbnb's Icons is a new collection of experiences hosted by big names
in music, film, television, arts, sports, and more. Current
entertainment-focused Icons include a floating replica of the house
from 'Up', a night in a VIP lounge with Kevin Hart, and a living room
performance from Doja Cat. The experiences are all priced at under
$100 per guest. Only a limited number of requests will be selected for
each experience via a lottery. Airbnb also rolled out other new
features this week, including the ability for groups of guests to more
easily book trips together. 

 EMAIL MICROSOFT DIDN'T WANT SEEN REVEALS RUSHED DECISION TO INVEST IN
OPENAI (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 An email sent to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and CEO Satya
Nadella by Kevin Scott, Microsoft's chief technology officer with the
subject line 'Thoughts on OpenAI' in mid-June 2019 detailed Scott's
concerns about Google's developments in AI and how it might take
Microsoft multiple years to even attempt to compete with Google.
Microsoft had tried to keep the email hidden, but it was made public
as part of the US Justice Department's antitrust trial over Google's
alleged search monopoly. Mere weeks after the email, Microsoft had
invested $1 billion into OpenAI, and it has increased its investment
significantly further since.

 TWO GIANTS IN THE SATELLITE TELECOM INDUSTRY JOIN FORCES TO COUNTER
STARLINK (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Luxembourg-based SES is buying Intelsat for $3.1 billion. The
acquisition will create a combined fleet of around 100 multi-ton
satellites in geostationary orbit, more than twice the size of the
next-largest commercial geostationary satellite operator. It is
expected to close in the second half of 2025 and is pending regulatory
approvals. Satellite operators are seeing an uptick in demand, and the
US military's appetite for commercial satellite communications is
going up. Both companies maintain hundreds of millions of dollars of
business with the US government each year. 

 VIRTUAL POWER PLANTS AND SOFTWARE (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) reduce the need for gas and oil-based
power plants by aggregating distributed energy resources (DERs) such
as rooftop solar and home/office batteries. These DERs help the grid
by reducing or meeting demand through remote control so power plants
can avoid having to burn dirty fuels during peak periods. They can
also reduce the need for additional electricity grid transmission and
distribution. VPPs provide a more predictable and easily managed way
of helping the grid stay balanced. This article explains how VPPs work
and discusses their future.

 WHAT'S COMING TO POSTGRESQL ? üêò (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 PostgreSQL is undergoing a series of transformations that could
redefine its role in the database landscape. This article explores
some of the developments shaping the future of PostgreSQL. One of the
most significant advancements coming to the PostgreSQL ecosystem is
the separation of compute and storage. This will bring major benefits
such as horizontal scalability, cost-effective scaling, seamless
replication, high availability, and improved development experience. 

 SOFTWARE FRICTION (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Friction is everywhere in software development. Two setbacks are more
than twice as bad as one setback. Addressing friction can also create
other sources of friction. Friction is inevitable and impossible to
fully remove, but there are things that can be done to reduce it, and
plans can be made more resilient to it. Things that can reduce
friction include smaller scopes and shorter iterations, more autonomy,
better planning, automation, and using checklists and runbooks.

 GOOGLE LAYS OFF HUNDREDS OF 'CORE' EMPLOYEES, MOVES SOME POSITIONS TO
INDIA AND MEXICO (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google has laid off at least 200 employees from its Core teams. The
reorganization will involve moving some roles to India and Mexico. The
Core unit is responsible for building the technical foundation behind
Google's flagship products and for protecting users' online safety.
The Core layoffs also include the governance and protected data group,
which will be at the center of regulatory challenges facing the
company. Affected employees have access to outplacement services and
will be able to apply for open roles within Google. 

 MAGIC MACHINES (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Programmers tend to assign more trust to computers run by anyone but
themselves. It's a lack of confidence in their own abilities that
leads programmers to think that the people operating their cloud
computers are smarter or better than they are. There are no magic
machines and no magic operators: all systems have the same kind of
potentially faulty bits and brains. It's all just computers and
people.
