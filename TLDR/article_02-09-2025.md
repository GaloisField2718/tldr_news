 ALIBABA SHARES JUMP 19% ON CLOUD UNIT ACCELERATION, REPORT OF NEW AI
CHIP (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Alibaba's shares are now at their highest level since March. The tech
giant has been investing in AI infrastructure and developing its own
models, as well as selling AI services for its cloud computing unit.
AI-related product revenue maintained triple-digit year-over-year
growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. Alibaba's core e-commerce
business has been showing signs of revival. It recently introduced a
feature on Taobao that provides deliveries of certain products in
China within an hour.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 TEACHING AI HOW SCIENCE ACTUALLY WORKS (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Current AI for science consists of specialized tools built on curated
data sets, but much of science is hands-on experimentation and
unrecorded tacit knowledge. AI scientists will need multimodal
datasets that capture that tacit knowledge for them to become truly
capable. The IFP has proposed an effort to generate and use the
multimodal data necessary to unlock the full potential of AI for
science. The program involves creating a lab that would simultaneously
conduct research while recording everything and then using that data
to make the whole process more productive. 

 THE LARGEST PROJECT IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY IS ABOUT TO ENTER A
KEY PHASE: THE FINAL ASSEMBLY OF THE REACTOR CORE, LED BY AN AMERICAN
GIANT (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Westinghouse Electric Company has secured a €168 million contract
to lead the assembly of the core of ITER's fusion reactor. The
critical operation will involve the precise installation and welding
of nine massive steel sectors to form the tokamak's vacuum vessel, the
heart of the fusion reactor. Each 400-ton sector must be positioned
and welded with millimeter precision to create a perfectly circular,
hermetically sealed chamber. ITER's primary technical goal is to
demonstrate fusion power at a commercial scale. If successful, the
project is expected to spawn multiple approaches to commercial fusion.

 RIPPLE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Ripple is a TypeScript UI framework that combines the best parts of
React, Solid, and Svelte into one package. It was designed to be a
JavaScript/TypeScript-first framework, rather than HTML-first. Ripple
has its own superset language that plays nicely with TypeScript and
JavaScript, but with an interesting touch that leads to a better
developer experience for both humans and large language models. It is
still in an early development stage. 

 LESSONS ON BUILDING AN AI DATA ANALYST (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article looks at what it takes to build an AI data analyst. It
provides tips on how to preserve quality where it matters without
blowing up response times. Text to SQL isn't enough because the task
is hard for current models - systems should instead run a multi-step
workflow. Context and metadata can mean the difference between the
right and wrong answer.

 WHERE ARE ALL THE TRILLION DOLLAR BIOTECHS? (28 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The drug development industry addresses the most tractable diseases
with the biggest outcomes first. However, unlike with other
industries, reinvesting capital from early wins back into the
ecosystem hasn't accelerated the industry's progress - it has been on
a reverse trend for a while now. For the industry to advance,
manufacturing and trials need to get cheaper with each run,
regulations should become more adaptive, approval frameworks should
increase and not decrease in variance, and new therapeutic modalities
should focus on unlocking new biology. Until these new paradigms take
hold, it will be difficult to build a trillion-dollar biotech. 

 THOUGHTS ON (AMAZONIAN) LEADERSHIP (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Amazon's Leadership Principles are famous in the tech world. They're
generally sensible rules by which to run a company. The principles
include Customer Obsession, starting with the customer and working
backwards; Ownership, thinking long term that not sacrificing
long-term value for short-term results and acting on behalf of the
company, not just your own team; and Bias for Action, making fast
decisions and being aware that many decisions and actions are
reversible and do not need extensive study. This article provides some
commentary on these principles.
