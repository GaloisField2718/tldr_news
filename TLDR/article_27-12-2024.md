 LEAKED DOCUMENTS SHOW OPENAI HAS A VERY CLEAR DEFINITION OF ‘AGI'
(3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Microsoft and OpenAI's definition of artificial general intelligence
(AGI) is 'a system that can generate at least $100 billion in
profits'. The companies agreed on the definition in 2023 as part of an
agreement which had a clause that stated that OpenAI would stop
allowing Microsoft to use any new technology it develops after AGI is
achieved. OpenAI and Microsoft have been on diverging paths for some
time now. Microsoft needs its own proprietary tech and OpenAI needs
more money. 

 DEEPSEEK-V3 IS NOW THE BEST OPEN SOURCE AI MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DeepSeek, a Chinese AI research lab, has released DeepSeek-V3, a
Mixture-of-Experts model that features a total of 671B parameters. The
model was trained on 14.8 trillion tokens. It has been released on
GitHub along with a detailed paper outlining its capabilities. The
model outperformed Meta's flagship Llama 3.1 405B parameter model and
many other closed-source models on benchmark scores.

 CHINA LAUNCHES 1ST SET OF SPACECRAFT FOR PLANNED 13,000-SATELLITE
BROADBAND CONSTELLATION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 China launched 10 internet satellites on a Long March 5B rocket
earlier this month. The satellites entered their predetermined orbits
smoothly and the mission was a complete success. They are the first
batch for Guowang, a broadband megaconstellation in low earth orbit
(LEO) that will eventually consist of nearly 13,000 spacecraft.
Guowang will be one of two Chinese versions of SpaceX's Starlink LEO
megaconstellation. 

 STARTUPS BEGIN GEOENGINEERING THE SEA (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Captura is a company that plans to electrochemically strip carbon
dioxide out of the ocean, store or use it, then return the water to
the sea, where it will naturally absorb more carbon dioxide from the
air. It will start pumping as much of the Pacific ocean as it can in a
few months at Hawaii's Keāhole Point. Besides Captura, there are
dozens of similar field trials and pilot projects that will start
scaling up their facilities in 2025.

 GHOSTTY (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 Ghostty is a terminal emulator that doesn't force you to choose
between speed, features, or native UIs. It can be used as a drop-in
replacement for your existing terminal emulator. In addition to being
a standalone terminal emulator, Ghostty is also a C-compatible library
for embedding a fast, feature-rich terminal emulator in any 3rd party
project. 

 ACTUAL WEB RENDERING IN TERMINAL (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 awrit is a full graphical web browser for Kitty terminal with mouse
and keyboard support. It works best with Kitty v0.28 or newer. awrit
can be used to display documentation from DevDocs, watch the changes
from Vite come to life, create a tiled layout without a tiling window
manager, and add fancy UI using web technologies.

 THOUGHTS ON THE EVE OF AGI (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The release of o3 suggests the next few years are going to be insane.
This post details some predictions about how AI will change the world
over the next few years. The predictions cover areas such as AI
agents, the software engineering industry, science and research, war
and societal chaos, what happens if AI goes rogue, and more. 

 WHY GOOGLE BOUGHT CHARACTER AI (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google may have bought Character AI because Character AI had figured
out how to run its models without costing a fortune. Character AI was
able to serve millions of users without bleeding money. Google is now
giving away flash models for free on AI Studio - this wouldn't be
possible without figuring out how to make inference really cheap.
Pre-training has hit diminishing returns, so companies are shifting
toward chain-of-thought prompting and inference-time optimizations.
