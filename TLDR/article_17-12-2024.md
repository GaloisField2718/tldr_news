in early 2025. It will be open to all T-Mobile postpaid customers for
free, but capacity is limited.

 ASK HN: SWES HOW DO YOU FUTURE-PROOF YOUR CAREER IN LIGHT OF LLMS?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [12] 

 Large language models are becoming a part of software engineering.
The technology could replace a lot of engineers, so younger engineers
may feel like they need to find a way to future-proof their careers.
The technology is still very new and can't produce professional code.
There's also a lot more to being an engineer than coding, so many
senior developers feel confident that it will be a while until AI can
replace software engineers, if ever. 

 CYPHERNETES (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Cyphernetes is a Kubernetes query language. It uses a mixture of
ASCII-art, SQL, and JSON to let developers express graph operations in
an efficient way that is also fun and creative. Cyphernetes allows
developers to query and mutate Kubernetes resources in a natural way.
It works out-of-the-box with CRDs and supports multi-cluster queries.

 AMAZON AND THE ENDANGERED FUTURE OF THE MIDDLE MANAGER (7 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Amazon is a leading indicator of a new era of flattening in corporate
structure. Its slashing of manager roles isn't just about cost
cutting, but a glimpse into the future of work. Amazon is targeting an
increase in the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at
least 15% by the end of Q1 2025 across all divisions. It is estimated
that the company could cut as many as 14,000 management positions,
which would result in $2 billion to $4 billion in savings.
