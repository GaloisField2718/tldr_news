 DOES YOUR EMAIL SECURITY PROTECT YOUR FILES AND ACCOUNTS, TOO?
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Today's attacks aren't targeting the inbox alone: sophisticated
attackers bypass perimeter defenses entirely with stolen credentials
or abused OAuth tokens. Your emails [5], files [6], and accounts [7]
can be accessed without triggering email security systems, EDR
systems, or most other security tools.

Material is the only comprehensive detection and response platform for
the cloud workspace, providing robust phishing and inbound threat
protection with unmatched visibility and control over account
behavior, file sharing activity, third party OAuth apps, and more.

 EARLY IOS 26 SOFTWARE LEAK UNCOVERS DOZENS OF UPCOMING APPLE FEATURES
(5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Software from an iPhone prototype running an early build of iOS 26
leaked last week. This article lists the most notable feature flags
found in the software code. The list shows what Apple was working on
around June. Some of the features include Vision Pro stickers, Live
Captions, Tilt to Scroll, and a Dynamic Sports Tier Manager. 

 PAYPAL APPLIES TO ESTABLISH BANK (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 PayPal has filed with the Utah Department of Financial Institutions
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to establish PayPal Bank. As a
Utah-chartered industrial lone company, the bank will be able to lend
money, hold FDIC-insured deposits, and be owned by a non-financial
institution. The proposed bank would help make PayPal's lending to
small businesses more efficient, as it would reduce reliance on third
parties. PayPal also plans to offer interest-bearing savings accounts
to customers through the proposed bank.

 ECONOMICS OF ORBITAL VS TERRESTRIAL DATA CENTERS (35 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 The economics of putting data centers in space are savage. While it
is theoretically possible, it's definitely not a sure thing. Only one
company, SpaceX, is positioned to even try due to its vertical
integration - having to buy launches, buses, hardware, deployment, and
pay margin at every interface will kill any other attempt. While
building this infrastructure may be a mediocre trade on strict
near-term unit economics, the second-order effects could be enormous. 

 TESLA STOCK CLOSES AT 2025 HIGH AFTER MUSK CONFIRMS DRIVERLESS
ROBOTAXI TESTS UNDERWAY IN AUSTIN (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Tesla is now testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas. The
company still hasn't announced when it will be able to operate a
ride-hailing service without human safety supervisors or drivers on
board. Texas will require authorization from the DMV for commercial
use of self-driving vehicles starting in May 2026. California's DMV
and Public Utilities Commissions say that Tesla has yet to apply for
the permits needed to conduct driverless testing in the state without
a human at the wheel, or to operate a commercial robotaxi service.

 PART 2: DESIGN IS A SEARCH FOR THE OPINIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The deeper someone gets into a field, the more specific their tools
get. Experts don't just use generic items. This applies to software as
well. Everything in software is opinionated. The work is in choosing
which opinions to embed and where to design something meaningful
without dissolving into blandness.

people understand what they are signing up for. It covers how startup
equity mechanics get manipulated, so people considering joining
startups know exactly what they're getting into. Time is the only

it for.
