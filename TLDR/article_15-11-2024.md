 HOW TO MODEL YOUR CUSTOMERS' ORGANIZATIONS IN A MULTI-TENANT APP
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you are modeling a multi-tenant SaaS app [4], an organization will
usually represent one of your customers. For authentication and
authorization purposes, you'll want each connection, directory, and
audit log event to belong to an organization.

For your SaaS to be enterprise-ready, you must be able to support
complex models, onboard users and orgs frictionlessly, and respond to
user changes from your customer's identity provider (IdP) in real
time. The way you manage organization modeling [4] affects all of
these.

[5] 

 Google has launched a dedicated Gemini app for iOS. It allows iPhone
users to interact with Google's AI through text or voice. The app

 SPOTIFY TAKES AIM AT YOUTUBE IN BATTLE FOR PODCASTS (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Spotify plans to start paying podcast hosts who make popular videos
and meet a certain viewing threshold. It will offer premium
subscribers in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada a way to watch
podcast shows without ads starting in January. Many people watch or
listen to their favorite shows on YouTube. Spotify is hoping to
differentiate its videos from shows on YouTube, where users have to
pay more for ad-free viewing.

 SPACEX STARSHIP MOVED TO LAUNCHPAD FOR 6TH FLIGHT TEST (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 SpaceX's Starship has been transported to a launchpad in preparation
for a scheduled flight test on November 18. SpaceX has already
performed a static fire, so launch preparations should only involve
checkouts, filling the tanks with fuel, and lighting the engines. The
sixth test flight will be similar to the fifth - there are a few
changes, but not enough to require modifications to the launch
license. Bigger changes are planned for the seventh flight test,
including larger propellant tanks and a new generation of thermal
protection tiles. 

 THE 'MORPHING' WHEEL FROM SOUTH KOREA THAT MAY TRANSFORM LIVES AND
ROBOTS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers from the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials have
developed a morphing wheel that can roll over obstacles up to 1.3
times the height of its radius. The wheel's spokes automatically
adjust their stiffness to the terrain, allowing them to navigate all
manner of obstacles, including curbs and staircases. The technology
could be used for many applications, including unmanned delivery
vehicles, wheelchairs, and movement in industrial settings. The
researchers aim to make the wheels viable for speeds up to 100
kilometers per hour.

 PROMPT INJECTING YOUR WAY TO SHELL: OPENAI'S CONTAINERIZED CHATGPT
ENVIRONMENT (25 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's containerized ChatGPT environment lets users interact with
the model's underlying structure. OpenAI uses a Debian-based sandbox
environment to run ChatGPT code. The environment's internal directory
structures can be exposed and manipulated using simple prompt
injections, but this is intentional rather than a security gap. OpenAI
appears to draw the line at breaking out of the containerized
environment. 

 ADDING PAYMENTS TO YOUR LLM AGENTIC WORKFLOWS (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article explores how to integrate the Stripe agent toolkit to
enhance AI agents' functionality. Stripe can enable agents to access
financial services and tools to help customers earn and spend funds,
facilitate common support operations, and bill for usage with metered
billing. Its agent toolkit gives AI agents access to the Stripe API,
allowing developers to create agentic workflows.

 SOMETHING WEIRD IS HAPPENING WITH LLMS AND CHESS (11 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 This post looks at different AI models' performance at playing chess.
Almost all large language models (LLMs) are terrible at chess except
gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct. It is unknown what is causing this, but it may
be due to different training data, the quality of training data, the
effects of instruction tuning, or there may be something particular
about different transformer structures. This may explain why people
got good results with LLMs and chess two years ago and why the field
has been quiet since. 

 GOOGLE IS FACING THE THREAT OF GOVERNMENT REGULATORS SUPERVISING ITS
FINANCIAL SERVICES (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google may soon be placed under formal federal supervision by the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is tasked with
keeping financial institutions accountable to consumers. Google
handles a lot of funds that it doesn't own and the CFPB has received
hundreds of complaints over the years from consumers experiencing
problems with billing through Google. Google has reportedly been
pushing back as hard as it can against the inquiry as if things move
forward, the bureau could gain unprecedented access to internal
company records.
