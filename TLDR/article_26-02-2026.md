 DATADOG RESEARCH: MOST CLOUD WORKLOADS ARE USING LESS THAN HALF THEIR
ALLOCATED RESOURCES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Datadog's 2025 State of Containers and Serverless report [4] analyzed
real usage data from tens of thousands of customers across AWS, Azure,
and Google Cloud.

The report covers 10 findings [4] on how container and serverless
adoption is shifting — including:

1️⃣ KARPENTER OVERTOOK CLUSTER AUTOSCALER for K8s node
provisioning, jumping from ~11% to 34% share in two years.

2️⃣ GPU INSTANCE HOURS TRIPLED since late 2023 as teams spin up
inference servers like vLLM and Triton for AI workloads.

3️⃣ ARM USAGE DOUBLED across both Lambda functions (9% → 19%)
and cloud instances (9% → 15%).

 THE 10 AM DROP: HOW JANE STREET BROKE BITCOIN'S PRICE (13 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Beginning in late 2024 and accelerating through 2025, Bitcoin's price
experienced sudden and sharp sell-offs every trading day at 10 AM
Eastern, coinciding with the US stock market open. The drops were
precise, algorithmic, and wildly disproportionate to the broader
market conditions. They wiped out leveraged long positions, triggered
cascading liquidations, and then reversed within hours. These dumps
stopped the moment Jane Street had lawyers looking over its shoulder
due to the Terraform Labs lawsuit, and they started again in Q3 2025
when the heat died down. 

 ANTHROPIC'S PENTAGON SHOWDOWN IS ABOUT MORE THAN AI GUARDRAILS (16
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has the most constrained use age policy of all of the AI
companies working on US military applications. It has a host of
limitations on the use of its technology intended to prevent broader
societal harm that includes core tenets such as 'Do Not Develop or
Design Weapons' and 'Do Not Compromise Computer or Network Systems'.
However, there are signs that the company's safety commitments are
slipping. The Pentagon's threat to potentially remove Anthropic from
the supply chain could be almost fatal to the business.

 ALPHABET-OWNED ROBOTICS SOFTWARE COMPANY INTRINSIC JOINS GOOGLE (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Alphabet-owned robotics company, Intrinsic, is joining Google to
unlock the promise of physical AI for a much broader set of
manufacturing businesses and developers. It will remain a distinct
entity within Google but work closely with Google DeepMind and tap
into Google's Gemini AI models and cloud services. Intrinsic announced
a joint venture with Foxconn in October that involves the two
companies working together on general-purpose intelligent robots to
transform how electronics are manufactured, with the goal of full
factory automation. The company is now working towards those goals
with closer collaboration with Google's AI prowess. 

 WAYVE, AN AI DRIVERLESS CAR START-UP IN EUROPE, RAISES $1.2 BILLION
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Wayve has raised $1.2 billion in a deal that values the London-based
autonomous vehicle software startup at $8.6 billion. The funding,
which could grow to $1.5 billion if it hits certain performance
targets, is one of the largest amounts raised by a European startup.
Wayve expects to have its driverless taxis on the road for customers
this year through a commercial trial with Uber. Consumer vehicles
incorporating its technology will be available to buy by 2027.

 TESTS ARE THE NEW MOAT (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Software contracts, tests, and API surface area are becoming more
valuable as AI becomes better at cloning people's work. This clashes
with the incentives of commercialized open source work. Previously,
the overhead of writing, understanding, and maintaining the code
itself was important. However, clearly defining and communicating open
source software's APIs makes it easier for AI to clone work. 

 NPM I CHAT – ONE CODEBASE, EVERY CHAT PLATFORM (1 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Vercel's new Chat SDK lets teams write bot logic once and deploy to
Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Discord, GitHub, and Linear. Its
event-driven architecture includes type-safe handlers for mentions,
messages, reactions, button clicks, and slash commands. The SDF
enables teams to build user interfaces using JSX cards and modals that
render natively on each platform. It handles distributed state
management using pluggable adapters for Redis, ioredis, and in-memory
storage.

 SOFTWARE COMPANIES BUYING SOFTWARE: A STORY OF ECOSYSTEMS AND VENDORS
(12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Several things are happening in software: a lot more startups with
super-fast revenue growth are popping up, margins are thinner,
engineering inequality is growing, and digital natives had a bunch of
layoffs. This is all a direct corollary of the platformization of
software, and it will continue. What's happening is expected - it just
took some time to happen. The software industry is now much bigger
than it was a decade ago, and AI is creating a ton of FOMO. 

 PRODUCTIVITY: THE EVIDENCE IS MIXED, BUT THE PATTERN IS CLEAR (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI increases productivity on well-scoped tasks where errors are
detectable. This breaks down when tasks get harder. When AI agent
output is scored algorithmically, it looks moderately capable, but
when scored holistically, performance drops substantially. Estimates
about AI's effect on productivity drop when task reliability is
factored in.
