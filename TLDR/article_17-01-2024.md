 APPLE HITS ‚ÄúALL-TIME HIGH‚Äù SMARTPHONE MARKET SHARE, TAKES #1 SPOT
FOR 2023 (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple was the number one smartphone OEM in 2023. It had a 20.1%
market share for the year, a 3.7% growth over 2022. Apple's
best-selling phone, and the best-selling model in the world, was the
iPhone 14 Pro Max. The company's cheapest phone, the iPhone SE at
$429, didn't sell well. Apple's market share is fueled by aggressive
trade-in offers and interest-free financing plans. 

 OPENAI CHANGES ITS STANCE, ANNOUNCES THAT IT IS WORKING WITH THE
PENTAGON (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has announced a partnership with the Pentagon. The company's
usage policy previously banned activities like weapons development and
military use and warfare, but it recently updated its policies to
remove the part about military use and warfare. OpenAI and the
Pentagon are working on cybersecurity software and are in discussions
about how OpenAI's technology could assist with preventing veteran
suicide.

 EXPERIMENTAL ULTRASOUND TREATMENT TARGETING BRAINS IN TRIALS TO HELP
THOSE WITH ALZHEIMER'S, DRUG ADDICTION (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new experimental treatment uses ultrasound to open the blood-brain
barrier using a specialized helmet to temporarily allow therapeutic
drugs to quickly get inside the brain. Patients are awake during the
procedure but they say the procedure is painless. In human trials, the
treatment resulted in a clear reduction in the beta-amyloid proteins
targeted. The treatment has also shown efficacy in treating patients
with severe drug addictions. 

 A CLONED RHESUS MONKEY IS STILL ALIVE AFTER 2 YEARS (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 A team of researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences claims one
of its cloned monkeys has lived more than two years, the longest any
cloned rhesus macaque has survived yet. It was developed using a new
method called the trophoblast replacement method. The new technique
could have implications for conventional IVF. There is still a lot of
trial and error involved - the researchers achieved just one live
fetus for every 113 activated embryos, and of all 11 embryos
transferred to a womb, only one produced a live fetus.

 HOW TO USE CHATGPT TO BUILD SOFTWARE PRODUCTS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This X post provides a small guide on how to use ChatGPT to build
software products. The process involves asking the model to go through
planning stages first to lay down a structure before getting it to
write code. It will take a few attempts with different ideas before
users get the hang of how to feed the model information to get good
results. 

 WHY LOWERCASE LETTERS SAVE DATA (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Both lowercase and uppercase letters use 1 byte each, but swapping
uppercase letters for lowercase letters saves data. This is due to how
text compression works. This article explains how text compression
works using interactive examples. It also provides examples where this
knowledge can be used to systematically save data.

 CEOS SAY GENERATIVE AI WILL RESULT IN JOB CUTS IN 2024 (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 A quarter of global CEOs expect that generative AI will lead to a
headcount reduction of at least 5% this year. Media and entertainment,
banking, insurance, and logistics are the industries most likely to be
affected by job losses due to cutting-edge AI tools. Engineering,
construction, and technology firms are least likely to anticipate cuts
because of automation. With AI, executives are most worried about the
cybersecurity risks and the spread of disinformation. 

 U.S. DEVELOPERS CAN NOW OFFER NON-APP STORE PURCHASING OPTION, BUT
APPLE WILL STILL COLLECT COMMISSIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [12]

way. Developers who want to offer alternative payment options need to
apply for a StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement. Details about
the specific rules for Entitlement Links are available in the article.
