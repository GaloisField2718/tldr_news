 APPLE MADE ONCE-UNLIKELY DEAL WITH SAM ALTMAN TO CATCH UP IN AI (8
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple and OpenAI have forged a partnership to integrate OpenAI's
ChatGPT into iOS. The agreement will be a key focus of Apple's
Worldwide Developers Conference next week. The partnership is likely a
short- to medium-term relationship for Apple, which is developing its
own AI features. Apple is still in talks with Google about using
Gemini in its devices. The company is also looking beyond chatbots -
it is currently working on a mobile robot that can follow users around
and handle chores on their behalf and AI features for its AirPods and
cameras.

February this year. The company reported $14 billion in profit in May.
Its AI accelerators make up between 70% and 95% of the market share
for AI chips. Nvidia has plans to launch a new AI chip every year.

 BOEING'S STARLINER MAKES IT INTO ORBIT AT LONG LAST ‚Äì WITH HUMAN
CREW ABOARD (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Boeing's Starliner crew capsule successfully blasted off on June 5
with two humans on board. The NASA-backed spacecraft is expected to
rendezvous with the International Space Station at 16:15 UTC today.
Previous launch attempts fared badly and there were many issues during
Starliner's development. A video of the launch is available in the
article. 

 NIGHT-VISION LENSES SO THIN AND LIGHT THAT WE CAN ALL SEE IN THE DARK
(4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Transformative
Meta-Optical Systems (TMOS) in Australia have developed a night-vision
film that weighs less than a gram and can be placed across existing
lensed frames. The technology captures visible and non-visible light
in one image, unlike traditional night-vision systems which capture
side-by-side views from each spectrum, resulting in a better-quality
view of what's in the dark. It could change the way people work and
play after dark. Details about how the tech works are available in the
article.

 REFLECTING ON ONE YEAR OF BEING AN ENGINEERING MANAGER (9 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Being an engineering manager can be more rewarding than you think.
The output is not as instant as with programming, but it allows you to
focus on creating better outcomes. This article contains lessons
learned from a year of being an engineer manager: everyone requires a
unique approach, business outcome matters, and meetings are not bad if
you get value from them. 

 DON'T FIX IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S TECHNICAL DEBT (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Technical debt is when developers make a decision to borrow against
their future productivity in order to achieve earlier product
delivery, and because of that decision, they must make recurring
interest payments in the form of wasted effort. While engineers hate
waste, management sees the issue in terms of costs. If there are
significant cost savings by spending time reducing wasted effort, then
managers will see it as a good investment, otherwise they may think
developers should just keep on wasting that effort. Companies exist to
make money, not reduce wasted effort.
