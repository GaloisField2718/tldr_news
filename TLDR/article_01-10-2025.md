 SCIENTISTS MAKE EMBRYOS FROM HUMAN SKIN DNA FOR FIRST TIME (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Scientists at the Oregon Health and Science University have created
early-stage human embryos by manipulating DNA taken from people's skin
cells, then fertilizing them with sperm. The technology could overcome
infertility due to old age or disease. It could even allow same-sex
couples to have a genetically related child. The technique still needs
significant refinement before a fertility clinic could even consider
using it, which could take a decade.

 EXAMPLES ARE THE BEST DOCUMENTATION (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Technical documentation is mostly aimed at people deeply immersed in
the ecosystem. However, many developers have to juggle a lot of
'worlds' in their heads daily. It takes a lot of mental energy to
restore context and understand what is going on when jumping between
projects, languages, and frameworks. Examples are great because a lot
of developers look at docs simply because they need to quickly find
out how to do something. Tutorials are often helpful, not because of
the walkthrough, but because they contain examples.

MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Amazon's hardware division has long been seen as a loss leader. The
company makes its profits from subscriptions and purchases made
through the Alexa voice assistant. Some product lines are now
profitable, and others are heading in that direction. The company's
recently revamped devices have higher prices, and they're much better
products. For the company to become a true leader in devices, it will
need breakthroughs that go beyond its current lineup.
