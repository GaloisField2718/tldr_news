 HOW TO STOP BOTS FROM ABUSING FREE TRIALS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Free trials help AI apps grow, but bots and fake accounts exploit
them [5]. They steal tokens, burn compute, and disrupt real users.

Cursor, the fast-growing AI code assistant, uses WorkOS Radar [4] to
detect and stop abuse in real time. With device fingerprinting and
behavioral signals, Radar blocks fraud before it reaches your app.

 INSIDE ELON MUSK'S OPTIMUS ROBOT PROJECT (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk has bet Tesla's future and his personal fortune on Optimus.
The humanoid robots have the potential to generate infinite revenue
for the company and eliminate poverty and the need for work. The
company is currently working on the third generation of its robot.
This article looks at how the robot is being trained and the
challenges that Tesla will need to address before a commercial version
is viable. 

 OPENAI IS TAKING ON APPLE'S APP STORE. IT'S GOT A LONG WAY TO GO (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is aiming to create an app store that rivals Apple's, but
early tests suggest that the company still has a long way to go.
ChatGPT's more than 800 million users can now perform various tasks,
such as order groceries from Instacart or create a playlist with
Spotify, using ChatGPT instead of opening an app. However, the current
system requires too many extra steps, making it more complicated to
use than traditional apps. Also, many ChatGPT apps only have very
basic functionality, steering users back to more capable apps or
sites.

 MEET THE ‘MAD MAX'-LOVING CEO CHALLENGING NVIDIA WITH A RENEGADE
CHIP (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Furiosa is a startup that makes neural processing units (NPUs), chips
designed to handle the type of computing calculations underpinning AI.
The startup's chips can provide similar performance to Nvidia's
advanced GPUs with less electricity usage. Mass production of the
chips is slated to start this month. This article tells the story of
June Pai, Furiosa's founder, and how he founded the company. 

 NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION (27 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The peptide scene exposes regulatory theater, economic desperation,
and a philosophical tension about bodily autonomy. While there is some
evidence that these compounds work, people are taking on a lot of risk
by using untested substances on themselves. The peptide gray market
has matured, making it likely unregulatable. This article looks at
some of the peptides available on the market and the evidence behind
their effectiveness.

 BORIS CHERNY'S CLAUDE CODE SETUP (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Boris Cherny created Claude Code. In this thread, he details his
setup and how he works with Claude Code. Claude Code was created to be
very customizable, but Cherny uses a surprisingly vanilla setup. Each
person on the Claude Code team uses the IDE very differently. 

 THE DISAPPEARING MIDDLE OF SOFTWARE WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The center of software work is moving. Previously, the model of
software work - turning intent into something real - absorbed most of
the time, attention, and craft of software teams. AI agents can now
produce working code from goals, context, and tasks. As systems
improve, the middle will get thinner, and less time will be spent
manually translating intent into implementation. Developers will still
need to understand the problem, gather the right context from
customers and internal teams, and shape the work. Directing and
managing agent work will become the craft in this era.

 NETFLIX REPORTEDLY WANTS TO KEEP MOVIES IN THEATERS FOR JUST 17 DAYS
AFTER IT BUYS WARNER BROS. (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Netflix wants to start streaming Warner Bros.' movies just 17 days
after their release in theaters. The companies may end up negotiating
a larger window of up to 45 days. This highlights the tension between
Hollywood and Netflix's priority of bolstering streaming. Netflix
expects the Warner Bros. transaction to close in the next 12 to 18
months, if it passes regulatory scrutiny. 

 MY THOUGHTS ON WATERLOO'S CO-OP PROGRAM (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The University of Waterloo has a co-op program that is famous for the
opportunities offered and the different countries you could work in.
All of the students in every graduating class always have jobs lined
up due to the over two years of work experience they gained in the
program. This post, written by a student who has been in the co-op for
a bit longer than a year, discusses how the program has changed them
and helped them. While the program gives students a massive head start
on their careers, financial independence, and the chance to live in a
new city every four months, it creates a lot of pressure, and students
are forced to grow up fast.
