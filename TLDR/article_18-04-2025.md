 JUDGE RULES GOOGLE OPERATES ILLEGAL AD MONOPOLY (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A federal judge ruled yesterday that Google created a monopoly that
allowed it to control parts of the online advertising industry. It is
the second time in eight months that Google has been labeled an
illegal monopolist. The company could be forced to sell some of its
advertising products. Google plans to appeal the ruling. 

 MUSK'S SPACEX IS FRONTRUNNER TO BUILD TRUMP'S GOLDEN DOME MISSILE
SHIELD (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX and two partners, Anduril and Palantir, are frontrunners in a
race to win a crucial part of President Trump's Golden Dome missile
defense shield. They have proposed a constellation of 400 to more than
1,000 missile defense satellites and a subscription model for missile
defense. Trump has cited a missile attack as the most catastrophic
threat facing the US. The decision process for the Golden Dome is in
its early stages and its ultimate structure and who is selected to
work on it could change drastically in the coming months.

 DAILY PILL MAY WORK AS WELL AS OZEMPIC FOR WEIGHT LOSS AND BLOOD
SUGAR (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Orforglipron is a daily pill by Eli Lilly that may be as effective in
lowering blood sugar and aiding weight loss in people with Type 2
diabetes as Ozempic. It is part of the GLP-1 class of drugs that have
become famous for their weight-loss effects. While the pill is still
expected to be expensive, it has the potential to become far more
widely used than current GLP-1s, which must be kept refrigerated and
must be injected. Eli Lilly will seek approval from the FDA later this
year to market the drug for obesity and early in 2026 for diabetes. 

 WORLD'S FIRST "NONSTOP BEATING HEART" TRANSPLANT IS A MEDICAL
BREAKTHROUGH (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Surgeons at the National Taiwan University Hospital have performed a
heart transplant during which the donor's heart continued beating
between the organ removal and transplantation stages. Donor hearts are
usually removed and preserved in cold storage, which can damage muscle
tissue, reducing function and health once transplanted. The operation
was possible due to a specially designed organ maintenance system that
kept the donor heart pumping with oxygenated blood throughout the
process. Followup appointments with the patient showed that they
maintain a low level of cardiac enzyme, something that usually spikes
during typical transplant conditions.

 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO BUILDING AGENTS (40 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Agents are AI systems that can perform workflows on users' behalf
with a high degree of independence. This guide, designed for product
and engineering teams, explores how to build agents with frameworks
for identifying promise use cases, clear patterns for designing agent
logic and orchestration, and best practices to ensure agents run
safely, predictably, and effectively. It provides the foundational
knowledge needed to confidently start building agents. Building
reliable agents means starting with strong foundations - start small,
validate with real users, and grow capabilities over time. 

 OPENAI LAUNCHES FLEX PROCESSING FOR CHEAPER, SLOWER AI TASKS (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's Flex processing is a new API option that provides lower AI
model usage prices in exchange for slower response times and
occasional resource unavailability. It is available in beta for the
company's recently released o3 and o4-mini reasoning models. Aimed at
lower-priority and non-production tasks, the feature reduces API costs
by exactly half. In the email announcing the launch of Flex
processing, OpenAI also indicated that developers in tiers 1 to 3 of
its usage tiers hierarchy will have to complete ID verification to
access o3.

 THE SECOND HALF (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The AI industry is now shifting its focus from solving problems to
defining problems. Evaluation is becoming more important than training
- people are now looking at how to measure real progress. A shift in
mindset and skill set is required to thrive in this new era. Players
in the game can now build billion- or trillion-dollar companies by
making useful products out of intelligence. 

 AT META TRIAL, SHERYL SANDBERG DEFENDS TACTICS WITH RIVALS (7 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Lawyers for the FTC pressed Sheryl Sandberg, who was second in
command at Meta from 2008 to 2022, on the witness stand on Wednesday
during the company's landmark antitrust trial. She was asked to
explain an email chain in which executives disallowed Google+ from
advertising with the company. She said that it was a scary time for
the company and that Google's new tool was being promoted on its main
search page. The FTC's volume of internal communication evidence is
compelling as it shows that Mark Zuckerberg had an interest in buying
a competitor.
