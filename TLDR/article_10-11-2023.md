WITHOUT LEAVING THE APPS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta has added a new feature that allows users to link their Facebook

promotions in their feeds. Users will be able to buy from Amazon's
Facebook and Instagram ads without leaving the app. It is unknown how

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 ‚ÄòREVOLUTIONARY‚Äô FIRST BLOOD TESTS TO DIAGNOSE ALZHEIMER‚ÄôS WILL
BE AVAILABLE ON NHS WITHIN YEARS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scientists have developed a test that can spot signs of
dementia-causing diseases in the blood. The process still needs
refinement before it is reliable and easy enough for doctors to use.
Many patients remain undiagnosed as they are fearful of current
testing methods, which include having a lumbar puncture. There are
many new treatments for dementia on the way. Early diagnosis will be
key as treatment can start before the brain is too damaged.

ENERGY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 LONGI has set a new world record for silicon-perovskite tandem solar
cells by reaching 33.9% efficiency. Tandem solar cells are made up of
different materials to improve the overall efficiency of the solar
cell. Perovskites are a naturally occurring mineral that can boost
silicon-based solar cells to a theoretical efficiency of 43%.
Development in the field has been quick - LONGI broke the same record
in November last year by achieving 26.81% efficiency.
