 HOW US CONSUMERS THINK ABOUT FINTECH – AND HOW TO USE IT TO YOUR
ADVANTAGE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 For years, Plaid has collaborated with The Harris Poll to track and
analyze evolving consumer behaviors and expectations [4] around
fintech. Their research has consistently shed light on which targeted
innovations are most likely to lead to fintech ROI.

This year is no exception–_The Fintech Effect 2025_ [4] uncovers
challenges and opportunities that will define the industry in 2026.
For example: 

 	* 56% of consumers expect fintech to use AI
 	* 61% trust apps more when they use AI to prevent fraud
 	* 77% insist their bank be able to connect to their chosen apps

 OPENAI, AMAZON SIGN $38 BILLION CLOUD DEAL (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI will pay Amazon $38 billion for computing power in a multiyear
deal. Amazon expects all of the computing capacity negotiated as part
of the agreement to be available by the end of the year. It wasn't
able to sell its cloud services to OpenAI for years because OpenAI had
an exclusive cloud-computing partnership with Microsoft. OpenAI is set
to generate $13 billion in revenue this year. It will have to continue
expanding sales at an exponential rate to pay for its computing needs.
Sam Altman claims that OpenAI is facing severe computing shortages and
that revenue will grow even faster as more capacity becomes available.

than 21 million daily users, making it one of the most popular online
dating services. Facebook Dating shows how social networking is
evolving into two broad categories: content and services.

 A COMMERCIAL SPACE STATION STARTUP NOW HAS A FOOTHOLD IN SPACE (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Vast's Haven Demo mission launched into orbit on Sunday on a SpaceX
Falcon 9 rocket. After being released from the rocket, the Haven Demo
spacecraft stabilized itself and extended its power-generating solar
array. A link to a 4K video of the solar array deployment is available
in the article. The Haven Demo will be followed by a single-module
human-rated habitat called Haven-1, and then a multi-module space
station complex named Haven-2. 

 ALPHABET IS INCREASINGLY LAUNCHING ‘MOONSHOT' PROJECTS AS
INDEPENDENT COMPANIES — HERE'S WHY (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Alphabet's X Moonshot factory is increasingly spinning out its
ambitious technology projects to market as independent companies
rather than keeping them within the Alphabet corporate structure,
because while some moonshots benefit from Alphabet's resources and
scale, others can go faster and won't really benefit from being part
of the company because they're too different. It uses a dedicated
venture fund called Series X Capital to invest in its spinouts. The
moonshot factory has a culture that celebrates killing off promising
ideas. It actively looks for reasons to shut down its projects,
resulting in a brutal 2% hit rate - this makes it necessary to have a
fund that deeply understands its goals.

 RMLX (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Rmlx is an R interface to Apple's MLX framework, which enables
high-performance GPU computing on Apple Silicon. It enables R on the
Mac to use the GPU, which is great for performing matrix operations
commonly seen in statistics. The package was vibe-coded with
Claude/OpenAI Codex in a week. 

 THE FETCH()ENING (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 htmx 4.0 contains three major simplifying changes: fetch() will
replace XMLHttpRequest as the core ajax infrastructure, attribute
inheritance will be explicit rather than implicit, and history support
will no longer snapshot to the DOM and keep it locally. Most things
will stay the same - except for adding an :inherited modifier on a few
attributes, most htmx projects will be compatible with htmx 4.0. htmx
2.0 will remain supported in perpetuity.

 THE GREAT DECOUPLING OF LABOR AND CAPITAL (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Today's megacap tech companies' growth is pretty much decoupled from
their headcount. This was evident even before Generative AI arrived on
the scene. AI taking over people's jobs might be a gradual thing
rather than a moment in time. Even if we don't reach 'AGI', the actual
difference of reaching it or not may prove to be minimal in a couple
of decades. 

 THE STARTUP WINTER IS ALWAYS COMING (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Market cycles keep repeating. Founders who internalize this pattern
are never surprised and can adapt to changing conditions. A startup is
a long trek through changing climates. Founders who ignore cycles risk
being caught off guard, but those who obsess over cycles risk
paralysis. The balance is to expect the inevitable and prepare for it
without being fearful of it.
