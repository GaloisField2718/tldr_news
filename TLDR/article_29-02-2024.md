 ELON MUSK‚ÄôS BOLD CLAIM: TESLA‚ÄôS ROADSTER TO HIT 0-60 MPH IN LESS
THAN ONE SECOND (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk claims that the Tesla Roadster, which he plans to unveil by
the end of 2024, can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in less than a
second. The current record holder for a production car's fastest 0-60
mph is the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170, which can do it in 1.66
seconds. If Musk's claims are true, the Tesla Roadster will be faster
than the speed of sound. Tesla aims to ship the car in 2025, four
years after its original 2020 target. 

 ADOBE‚ÄôS NEW PROTOTYPE GENERATIVE AI TOOL IS THE ‚ÄòPHOTOSHOP‚Äô OF
MUSIC-MAKING AND EDITING (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adobe's Project Music GenAI Control is a prototype tool that allows
users to generate and edit music using text prompts. It has controls
for customizing results and remixing sections of audio. The tool can
generate audio based on a reference melody and extend the length of
audio clips. It is unclear whether the tool will allow uploads of any
audio as reference material or how long clips can be extended for. The
tool isn't available to the public yet and no release date has been
announced.

 MAN IN REMISSION FROM BLOOD CANCER AND HIV AFTER REMARKABLE TREATMENT

 A Californian man who contracted blood cancer while living with HIV
is in remission from both. The patient's treatment involved receiving
a transplant of stem cells with a rare genetic mutation that provides
resistance to HIV. The treatment targeted the blood cancer - HIV
resistance was an extra benefit. The patient is the fifth person ever
to overcome both illnesses. 

 VARDA CAPSULE REENTRY - FIVE MINUTES FROM LEO TO EARTH (6 MINUTE
VIDEO) [8] 

 Varda Space Industries' W-1 spacecraft successfully landed in Utah on

spacecraft on US soil. The spacecraft reentered the Earth's atmosphere
at speeds over Mach 25 before safely deploying its parachute and
landing. Varda has released a video from a camera onboard the W-1
spacecraft showing it orbiting the Earth in low-Earth orbit, smoothly
separating from Rocket Lab's satellite bus, and then reentering
Earth's atmosphere.

 APPLE SPENT MORE THAN $10 BILLION ON APPLE CAR BEFORE CANCELING
PROJECT (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Apple spent more than $10 billion working on the Apple Car since the
project first launched in 2014. The money was spent on research and
development, with thousands of engineers and car experts working on
the project. Apple was never able to find the right leader for the
project - the project had four different leads over its course of 10
years. Most of the more than 2,000 employees who worked on the car
project will be redistributed, while some will be laid off. Apple will
apply its learnings from the car project to other devices. 

 ASK HN: SLOW THINKERS, HOW DO YOU COMPENSATE FOR YOUR LACK OF
QUICK-WITTEDNESS? (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 This Hacker News thread contains tips for slow thinkers to overcome
and compensate for their lack of quick thinking ability. Many slow
thinkers have potential, but they lose their capacity when forced to
make quick decisions or generate arguments on the spot. Ways to get
around this include taking your time to answer questions and preparing
for situations in advance. Finding and acknowledging weaknesses, and
then finding specific techniques or processes to overcome them, will
significantly improve most outcomes.
