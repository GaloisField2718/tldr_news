 CRUSOE BYOM: 5X HIGHER THROUGHPUT FOR CUSTOM MODELS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You've built the perfect fine-tuned model. Now scale it without
compromise. Generic cloud infrastructure wasn't designed for
proprietary architectures, leading to performance bottlenecks.
Crusoe's Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) changes that. Powered by
MemoryAlloy™ technology, Crusoe optimizes its inference engine
specifically for your unique weights.

The result? 5x higher throughput and breakthrough Time-To-First-Token
speed compared to stock vLLM. Maintain total IP ownership with
dedicated capacity and "glass box" visibility. Stop letting
infrastructure hold back your AI innovation and start scaling with
precision.

 CAN OPENAI BUILD ALEXA BEFORE AMAZON CAN BUILD CHATGPT? (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 OpenAI and Amazon are currently racing to execute an AI device
strategy. Interestingly, Amazon reportedly plans to invest $50 billion
into OpenAI's newest funding round. Amazon is also the largest
shareholder in OpenAI's chief startup rival, Anthropic. New reports
suggest that OpenAI may be building custom models for Amazon's
products, even while it is hard at work on its first devices. 

 APPLE'S NEXT BIG THING IS A PUSH INTO VISUAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
(14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The defining feature of Apple's push into wearable AI devices will be
Visual Intelligence. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been dropping hints about
AI wearables built around AI technology that can see the surrounding
environment and use that context to take action. The company is
working on its own visual models with the intention of making them
central to its upcoming set of AI devices, which include advanced
AirPods, smart glasses, and a pendant. Apple plans to hold its first
product launches of the year in March.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 HAVE WE LEAPT INTO COMMERCIAL GENETIC TESTING WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
IT? (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Polygenic scores tally the contributions of many genes to particular
traits to predict certain outcomes. They are probabilistic, not
deterministic, as many traits are determined by environmental factors
as well as genes. Potential parents using IVF are now able to choose
embryos based on their polygenic scores. While it is understandable
that parents want to give their kids the best chance of success, the
practice may have unintended consequences on the human gene pool, not
to mention the ethical implications. 

 AI DATA CENTERS TURN TO HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Microsoft is exploring the potential use of high-temperature
superconductors (HTS) as a replacement for copper wiring. HTS could
improve energy efficiency by reducing transmission loss. It could also
increase the resiliency of electrical grids and limit the impact of
data centers on communities by reducing the amount of space required
to move power. Microsoft has invested $75 million into Veir, a
superconducting power technology developer, to advance the technology.

 CODE MODE: GIVE AGENTS AN ENTIRE API IN 1,000 TOKENS (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Cloudflare has introduced a new MCP for the entire Cloudflare API
that uses Code Mode. The server can provide access to the entire
Cloudflare API over MCP while consuming only around 1,000 tokens. Code
Mode is a technique for reducing context window usage during agent
tool use. It involves letting the model write code against a typed SDK
and executing the code safely in a Dynamic Worker Loader instead of
describing every operation as a separate tool. The code acts as a
compact plan, and the model can explore tool operations, compose
multiple calls, and return just the data it needs. 

 HOW OPENAI'S CODEX TEAM WORKS AND LEVERAGES AI (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI's Codex team has reimagined how an engineering organization
can function in an AI-native world. The team operates with a high
level of trust, autonomy, and speed. Decision-making is fast,
ownership is clear, and individuals are empowered to build end-to-end.
The team has truly embraced AI as a way to be more productive. AI is
treated as a first-class teammate that shapes planning, execution,
review, onboarding, and iteration. This allows the team to move with
startup-level velocity while working on some of the most complex
systems in the world.

 ENTIRELY FORESEEABLE AWS OUTAGES (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Amazon Web Services experienced at least two minor outages at the end
of last year caused by malfunctions in its internal AI tooling. These
outages were entirely foreseeable, even by employees. Large language
models are extremely complex systems, and this complexity creates real
risk. Amazon never misses a chance to point to 'AI' when it is useful,
but when there's an outage, suddenly it's just a 'coincidence' that AI
tools were involved. 

 ATOMS ARE CHEAP, PROCESS IS PRICEY (42 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Fast feedback loops allow you to get ideas to reality more quickly.
This pattern is seen in every successful frontier tech effort. The
common thread is treating reality as the teacher and getting to class
as often as possible. Iterate fast, and validate using reality instead
of thinking your way to perfect solutions.

 HOW I THINK ABOUT CODEX (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Codex is comprised of a model that provides intelligence, a harness

a real development environment, and runtimes and interfaces where
agents can be put to work. 

 DESIGN DOCS CONSIDERED HARMFUL (7 MINUTE READ) [18]
