 IS OPENAI THE NEXT CHALLENGER TRYING TO TAKE ON GOOGLE SEARCH? (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is working on a web search to compete more directly with
Google. It is unclear if the product will be standalone or part of
ChatGPT. Competition in the search space is filling up quickly with
the addition of Copilot on Bing, newcomers like Perplexity, and
Google's Gemini Copilot. A YouTube Short featuring Microsoft CEO Satya
Nadella talking about competing with Google is available in the
article. 

 WHY WALKING AROUND IN PUBLIC WITH VISION PRO MAKES NO SENSE (7 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The passthrough on Apple's Vision Pro gives users all the fidelity
and depth perception they need to comfortably see what they're doing
and navigate safely on foot. Its limited field of view and poor
low-light visibility could pose issues when driving. While critics of
the device say it takes people's attention away from reality, the
Vision Pro may actually make users more aware of their surroundings as
their eyes are always up and taking in the world (when in passthrough
mode). This article details a first-hand experience of what it feels
like to use the device in public.

 MAGICLAB'S HUMANOID CAN TOAST MARSHMALLOWS, FOLD CLOTHES, AND DANCE
(6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 MagicLab has unveiled MagicBot, a humanoid robot that can roast
marshmallows and dance. The robot has exceptional balance and
dexterity - it has the capability to execute somersaults. MagicBot has
sub-millimeter positioning accuracy and a load capacity reaching
several kilograms. Videos of the robot in action are available in the
article. 

 OPEN-SOURCE SECURITY CHIP RELEASED (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The OpenTitan coalition has announced the first commercial silicon
chip that includes built-in open-source hardware security. The chip,
called Earl Grey, features a number of built-in hardware security and
cryptography modules in a self-contained microprocessor. It uses a
security protocol called Root of Trust, which provides an on-chip
source of cryptographic keys that is inaccessible remotely. As part of
the project, OpenTitan developed a framework for open-source hardware
design that provides rules for documentation, pre-defined interfaces
and quality standards, and a governance structure that lays out how
different partners make decisions as a collective.

 OINK.PHP (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 oink.php is a single-file API wrapper for PHP. It makes it easy to
route endpoints, set parameters, and return responses. oink.php was
designed to be simple and comfortable to use. Examples of using
oink.php to create a blog and gallery are available. 

 OPENLLMETRY-JS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 OpenLLMetry-JS is a set of extensions built on top of OpenTelemetry
that provides developers with complete observability over their LLM
applications. It can be connected to existing observability solutions.
OpenLLMetry-JS can instrument everything that OpenTelemetry already
instruments. It also has custom extensions for instrumenting things
like calls to OpenAI or Vector DBs.

 THE TEXT FILE THAT RUNS THE INTERNET (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 robots.txt has kept the internet from chaos for three decades. The
simple text file represents a deal between some of the earliest
pioneers of the internet to respect each other's wishes and build the
internet in a way that benefits everybody. It allows anyone who runs a
website to tell the web who's allowed on the site and who isn't. The
system used to work, but AI is now threatening to change everything.
This article takes a look at the history behind robots.txt, how it
works, different types of web crawlers, the tradeoff between sites and
the search engineers crawling them, and how AI changes the balance of
the internet. 

 REQUESTS FOR STARTUPS (20 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Requests for Startups is a periodic feature from Y Combinator that
gathers ideas and categories that it wants to see more people working
on. The list is intended to provide founders with ideas on what to
build. Readers should not feel like they need to work on one of these
ideas to apply to Y Combinator - the company expects to fund only a
small fraction of ideas from the list. The list covers areas such as
robotics, machine learning, manufacturing, space, enterprise software,
cryptocurrency, and more.
