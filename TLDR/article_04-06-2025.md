 BEYOND 2NM: APPLE'S A20 CHIP TO INTRODUCE NEW PACKAGING BREAKTHROUGH
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's A20 chip, built on TSMC's second-gen 2nm process, will be
used in the iPhone 18 Pro, 18 Pro Max, and iPhone 18 Fold. The
processors use Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module packaging, which allows
different components to be integrated directly at the wafer level. The
technique, which connects the dies without needing an interposer or
substrate, brings both thermal and signal integrity benefits. This is
a big leap in chip design and shows how technologies once reserved for
data center GPUs and AI accelerators are making their way into
smartphones. 

 MUSK SAYS SPACEX REVENUE WILL NEAR $16 BILLION IN 2025 (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 SpaceX is on track to generate about $15.5 billion in revenue in
2025. The startup is privately owned, so information about its
performance is rare. SpaceX's two main business lines are its launch
operation and Starlink. Elon Musk claims that commercial revenue at
SpaceX will exceed NASA's entire budget next year. A large part of the
startup's cash is flowing toward Starship.

 HUMAN BRAIN CELLS ON A CHIP FOR SALE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Australian startup Cortical Labs' CL1 is a code-deployable biological
computer that fuses human brain cells on a silicon chip to process
information via sub-millisecond electrical feedback loops. A tool for
neuroscience and biotech research, the CL1 offers scientists a new way
to study how brain cells process and react to stimuli. It uses live
human neurons capable of adapting, learning, and responding to
external inputs in real time. The CL1 will begin shipping in the
summer at $35,000 each, or $20,000 when purchased in 30-unit server
racks. 

 NEURALINK COMPETITOR PARADROMICS COMPLETES FIRST HUMAN IMPLANT (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Neurotech startup Paradromics implanted its brain-computer interface
in a human for the first time on May 14. The patient was already
undergoing neurosurgery to treat epilepsy. The brain-computer
interface was implanted and removed from the patient's brain in about
20 minutes during that surgery. The procedure demonstrated that
Paradromics' system can be safely implanted and record neural
activity. The startup plans to kick off a clinical trial later this
year to study the long-term safety and use of its technology in
humans.

 WHY GUIS ARE BUILT AT LEAST 2.5 TIMES (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Your mental model for 'what making software is' is extremely
important when trying to figure out how to 'manage' it. A lot of what
is essential for making great products will look like 'waste' when
viewed through a manufacturing lens. When 'making software' is viewed
as a process of discovery, developers behave completely differently -
they might try to get something into users' hands as fast as possible
or run parallel experiments in production with different versions. The
goal isn't just to produce, but to find out what should be built. 

 QUARKDOWN (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Quarkdown is a modern Markdown-based typesetting system that can
seamlessly compile projects into print-ready books or interactive
presentations. It uses a Turing-complete extension of Markdown to
ensure ideas can flow automatically into paper. Quarkdown brings
functions and other syntax extensions to Markdown, opening up
unlimited possibilities. Developers can define their own functions and
variables within Markdown and create libraries to share with other
users.

 META AND YANDEX ARE DE-ANONYMIZING ANDROID USERS' WEB BROWSING
IDENTIFIERS (21 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Meta and Yandex Are embedding tracking code into millions of websites
to de-anonymize visitors. The code abuses legitimate Internet
protocols, causing browsers to send unique identifiers to native apps
installed on a device. It bypasses core security and privacy
protections provided by the Android operating system and the browsers
that run on it. Currently, the only way to protect against the
tracking is to refrain from installing the Facebook, Instagram, or
Yandex apps on Android devices. 

 DOES AI PROGRESS HAVE A SPEED LIMIT? (34 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The external world puts a speed limit on AI development. Systems need
to be tested in real-world conditions to encounter failures they can
learn from. Edge cases can be learned, but that will often need to
happen while doing real tasks. This creates a speed limit in two ways:
you have to wait to collect that data and some people may be reluctant
to try out the technology while the system works out its bugs.
