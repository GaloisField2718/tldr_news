 META TO CHALLENGE APPLE WITH ITS FIRST SMARTWATCH — AND IT'S
REPORTEDLY LAUNCHING THIS YEAR (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meta plans to release its first smartwatch sometime this year.
Code-named Malibu 2, the smartwatch will offer health-tracking tools
along with a built-in Meta AI assistant. A Meta smartwatch could
theoretically play nicely with both Android and iOS smartphones,
unlike the Apple Watch. A smartwatch has the potential to unlock a lot
more gesture-based functionality for Meta's glasses. 

 MARK ZUCKERBERG SAID HE REACHED OUT TO APPLE CEO TIM COOK TO DISCUSS
‘WELLBEING OF TEENS AND KIDS' (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Mark Zuckerberg reached out to Tim Cook in 2018 to discuss the
wellbeing of teens and kids. He thought there were opportunities that
Meta and Apple could be doing and wanted to talk about them. The email
exchange was revealed as part of a trial related to alleged harms of
certain digital filters promoting cosmetic surgery. It was used to
support the claim that Zuckerberg cares about the wellbeing of teens
and kids using Meta's services.

 MICROSOFT'S NEW 10,000-YEAR DATA STORAGE MEDIUM: GLASS (5 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Microsoft's Project Silica is a working demonstration of a system
that can read and write data into small slabs of glass with a density
of over a Gigabit per cubic millimeter. The system can write up to
4.84TB in a single slab of glass of 12cm x 12cm x 0.2cm in about 150
hours. The main draws of the technology are that it takes no energy to
preserve data and the data can be retrieved rapidly if needed. The
glass also offers extreme stability, with experiments suggesting the
data would be stable for over 10,000 years at room temperature. 

 FDA REVERSES SURPRISE REJECTION OF MODERNA'S MRNA FLU VACCINE (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The FDA has now agreed to review Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine after the
company held a formal meeting with the FDA and proposed a change to
the regulatory pathways used in the application. Moderna hopes to make
its vaccine available this year, pending FDA approval. The reason for
initially refusing to review the application was based on the
established flu vaccine Moderna used for comparison in its Phase 3
trial, which the FDA said did not reflect the best-available standard
of care, but the agency ultimately signed off on the trial design.
Moderna has agreed to add a comparison of high-dose vaccines to some
older participants and provide the FDA with additional analysis.

 AUTOMATE REPOSITORY TASKS WITH GITHUB AGENTIC WORKFLOWS (13 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 GitHub Agentic Workflows is now in technical preview. It allows
developers to build automations using coding agents in GitHub Actions
to handle triage, documentation, code quality, and more. Developers
describe the outcomes they want in plain Markdown, add it as an
automated workflow to their repository, and it executes using a coding
agent in GitHub Actions. This makes entirely new categories of
repository automation and software engineering possible. 

 THE MYTHICAL AGENT-MONTH (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 There is now practically nothing stopping people and their agents
from pursuing all avenues that would have previously been cost- or
time-prohibitive. The temptation to spend your day prompting is
overwhelming. However, building great software was never about how
fast code was generated. We still need good design decisions and
engineers who say no to most product ideas, maintain conceptual
integrity, and know when something is 'done'.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AGAINST TASTE (26 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The taste thesis actually proposes a fundamental demotion of human
agency. For most of human history, the concept of taste as we
understand it didn't exist - there was patronage, an intimate
relationship between capital and artistic labor. The patron
commissioned work rather than selected from finished works on a wall.
The taste thesis reverses this order and places man at the end of the
chain of creation. 

 THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION (17 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Before the Industrial Revolution, the average person only owned a few
pairs of clothes, usually made by hand. Now, there are very few people
who make clothes, but there are thousands of apparel companies for
every type of activity. The Software Industrial Revolution will lead
to an explosion of bespoke software across every industry and niche.
The fact that we'll no longer build software by hand means that we
will build and use much more of it. Everything in the economy that
touches software is about to fundamentally and radically change.
