 APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS U.S. BAN OF TIKTOK (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A federal appeals court has ruled that TikTok can be banned in the US
over national security concerns. The ruling rejected arguments that
the ban was an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. The ban
was intended solely to limit a foreign nation's ability to gather data
on people in the US. TikTok claims US security fears are speculative
and overblown. It is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, but the
justices are not obliged to hear the case. 

 APPLE 'INVESTIGATING' MACS WITH CELLULAR CONNECTIVITY (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Apple is investigating the possibility of adding a modern chip to a
future Mac, but a cellular Mac isn't likely to launch until 2026 or
later. The company plans to introduce its custom-built 5G chip early
in 2025. It will be added to the iPhone SE, low-cost iPad, and iPhone
17 Air. The chip will be expanded to other iPhones and iPads over a
three-year period. The first-generation chip will be limited to
sub-6GHz 5G speeds, but the second-generation version will support
faster mmWave technology.

 LOWER-COST SODIUM-ION BATTERIES ARE FINALLY HAVING THEIR MOMENT (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer, has announced its
second-generation sodium-ion battery, which has an energy density of
200 watt-hours per kilogram. The company plans to start mass
production of the battery in 2027. Sodium-ion batteries perform better
than lithium-ion batteries in extreme cold and they carry a much lower
risk of fire. The process for manufacturing sodium-ion batteries is
similar to that of lithium-ion batteries, so existing assembly lines
can be reused without having to spend heavily on retooling. Their
biggest disadvantage is low energy density, but they have the
potential to be cost-competitive with lithium-ion batteries. 

 INTEL LOOKS BEYOND SILICON, OUTLINES BREAKTHROUGHS IN ATOMICALLY-THIN
2D TRANSISTORS, CHIP PACKAGING, AND INTERCONNECTS AT IEDM 2024 (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Intel's Foundry Technology Research team has announced technology
breakthroughs in 2D transistor technology. It plans to unveil its
research at the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting 2024
conference. The research includes enhancements in gate-all-around
transistor scaling and performance both with silicon and with
atomically-thin 2D transistors that use beyond-silicon materials. It
also outlines Intel's subtractive Ruthenium technology, which improves
interconnect performance and scalability, ultimately enabling smaller
wires between transistors, and a chip packaging breakthrough that
improves chip-to-chip assembly throughput by 100x.

 INTELLIGENCE ARBITRAGE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 We are currently watching the biggest transformation yet in how
businesses scale: the separation of intelligence from service
delivery. This is being driven by investors who understand that AI is
about operating leverage. This article looks at the interesting ways
private equity is separating the 'intelligence layer' from service
delivery. The real opportunity isn't in building AI or buying
companies, it's in creating entirely new financial structures.
