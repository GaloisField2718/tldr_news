 THINKING MACHINES LAB IS EX-OPENAI CTO MIRA MURATI'S NEW STARTUP (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's former CTO Mira Murati's new startup, Thinking Machines Lab,
has come out of stealth. The startup intends to build tooling to make
AI work for peoples' unique needs and goals and to create AI systems
that are more widely understood, customizable, and generality capable
than those currently available. It will focus on building multimodal
systems that can adapt to the full spectrum of human expertise and
enable broader applications. Murati joins a growing list of former
OpenAI execs who have launched startups. 

 OPENAI BOARD CONSIDERS SPECIAL VOTING POWERS TO PREVENT ELON MUSK
TAKEOVER (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is considering granting new voting rights to its nonprofit
board to help it fight the unsolicited takeover bid from Elon Musk.
Giving the nonprofit's board outsized voting power would ensure it
retains control of the restructured company and is able to overrule
other investors, ensuring OpenAI can fight off hostile bids from
outsiders. OpenAI could also consider a plan that would let
shareholders buy up additional shares at a discount to fend off
hostile takeovers.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SCIENTISTS CREATED THE LIGHTEST AND STRONGEST NANOMATERIAL EVER (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers at the University of Toronto have created a new material
with the toughness of steel that weighs about as much as foam. They
used AI to recognize the best configurations of nanostructures to
create the tough and impossibly light material. The new nanomaterial
can be mass-produced, unlike its predecessors. The lightweight nature
of the material could result in more comfortable prosthetics and
implants and more efficient vehicles. 

 AI USED TO DESIGN A MULTI-STEP ENZYME THAT CAN DIGEST SOME PLASTICS
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI-driven protein design has enabled the possibility of creating
things unlike anything found in nature. Scientists have successfully
created an enzyme with the potential to digest plastics. Breaking down
ester bonds in plastics requires four steps - getting AI to design a
protein with the right configuration to do one of these steps is easy,
but having it cycle through all four is much harder. The scientists
overcame challenges by adding more AI models and eventually designed
an esterase capable of digesting the bonds in PET, a common plastic.

 MY LLM CODEGEN WORKFLOW ATM (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article discusses a workflow that uses large language models for
code generation (LLM codegen) that has been effective for building
many small products. The workflow involves brainstorming a spec,
making a plan, and then executing that plan using LLM codegen. The
process is repeated until magic happens. 

 KAFKA AT THE LOW END: HOW BAD CAN IT GET? (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Kafka does poorly as a job queue. It unfairly assigns jobs to
workers, even if other workers have nothing to do. Kafka is not a bad
tool, it is just not designed for low volume - it was designed for
scenarios where a conventional single-node message broker can't keep
up. If that speed isn't required, then it's better to use a
conventional broker with more suitable features (at least until Queues
for Kafka comes along).

 THE ONE AI TO RULE THEM ALL (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The next AI model war may be upon us, but this time it will be a
smaller one as the gains, while real, have been increasingly expensive
and granular. We are seemingly reaching parity among the players.
While they all have more specific areas of focus and subfeatures, they
are all trying to consolidate their products to simplify them for
everyday use. This article ranks current AI offerings from a pure
consumer perspective. 

 THE MARKETING GENIUS OF BRYAN JOHNSON (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Bryan Johnson's Don't Die lifestyle has grabbed the world's
attention. Johnson stands out - no one else is making content about
not dying. His 'Don't Die' slogan is hard to scroll past, short, and
snappy. Johnson doesn't try to appeal to everyone - his extreme
lifestyle polarizes people, but he only needs a small number of
fanatical fans. This article looks at Johnson's marketing tactics,
which have resulted in 1,440,000 YouTube subscribers, 503,000
followers on X, and 1,500,000 Instagram followers.
