 SPACEX'S STARSHIP TOOK A BEATING, BUT HELD ON FOR FIRST RETURN FROM
SPACE (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX's Starship launched successfully and made a controlled
splashdown for the first time on Thursday. The test fell short of
total perfection, but it was still a large success. Two of the 33
Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster failed and there was damage
to the ship's thermal protection tiles and one of its control flaps.
SpaceX has already test-fired the ship for the next test flight, and
the booster could be hot-fired soon. The next test flight, which could
happen within a couple of months, may involve an onshore landing. 

 NETFLIX'S LATEST REDESIGN AIMS TO SIMPLIFY YOUR HOMEPAGE (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Netflix is testing a homepage redesign on its TV app that replaces
the static tiles with boxes that extend when they're selected. It is
also removing the menu that pops out from the left side of its
homepage and replacing it with a more streamlined selection of options
at the top of the screen. The new homepage will be tested among a
small group of users to start and expanded to more members if it goes
well.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 MOST LIFE ON EARTH IS DORMANT, AFTER PULLING AN ‚ÄòEMERGENCY BRAKE'
(11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have discovered a new hibernation factor called Balon.
The protein is very common, being present in 20% of all cataloged
bacterial genomes. Balon inserts itself into every ribosome in a cell,
interrupting even active ribosomes in the middle of their work. Its
mechanism is a reversible process. Unlike other hibernation factors,
Balon can be inserted to stall growth and then quickly ejected. 

 SCIENTISTS DEVELOP ULTRA-THIN BATTERY FOR SMART CONTACT LENSES THAT
COULD BE CHARGED BY TEARS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have created an ultra-thin battery about 0.2 millimeters
thick. Powered by a biocompatible saline solution, the battery is thin
enough to fit inside a 0.5-millimeter contact lens. The battery can
use the glucose in tears to power up. Its capacity and voltage are
currently very low and insufficient for powering data storage or an
internet connection.

 DOWN FOR LESS THAN FOUR MINUTES A MONTH: HOW AWS DEPLOYS CODE (7
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AWS gives customers service credits if it fails to maintain 99.9%
uptime. It uses automation to respond to issues - its Monthly Uptime
Percentage commitment means there's no time for manual action at all.
This article takes a look at how AWS achieves this feat. While some of
its deployment processes can be hard to adopt without AWS' scale and
maturity, most of the core principles can be applied by startups.

a deal that allows them to proceed with antitrust investigations into

artificial intelligence industry. The Justice Department will take the
lead in investigating Nvidia, while the FTC will examine the conduct

anti-monopoly laws. 

 TESLA CEO ELON MUSK COULD LEAVE IF $56 BILLION PAY PACKAGE NOT

 Tesla shareholders will decide whether to approve a $56 billion
compensation package for Elon Musk on June 13. Tesla board chair Robyn
Denholm wrote a letter to shareholders, urging them to approve the
package. Not approving the package may mean Musk may leave the

the pay proposal, early voting suggests that the package will be
approved.
