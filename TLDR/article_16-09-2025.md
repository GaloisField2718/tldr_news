 THE MSP WAY: OVERPROMISE, UNDERDELIVER, AND. CHARGE FOR EVERY TICKET
(SPONSOR) [4]

fixed-price subscription [4] that includes:

 A TERMINAL COMMAND THAT TELLS YOU IF YOUR USB-C CABLE IS BAD (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Android Studio recently added a new feature that warns users when
they connect a slow cable to their phones. This post presents a script
that checks USB connections in macOS. The script was originally
cobbled together with AI, but while it worked, it was a mess to
maintain. The developer used AI to port it to Go so the code could be
structured more legibly and more easily tweaked.

CONTENT (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Apple has a custom CSS property named -apple-visual-effect that
allows the use of Liquid Glass in iOS 26. It only works by toggling a
private setting in WKPreferences, so using it means no App Store

Apple is using it.

 THE LAST DAYS OF SOCIAL MEDIA (32 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Genuine human content is increasingly being sidelined by algorithms.
Engineered content and AI slop optimized solely for clicks are being
prioritized. Early social media was built for connection. The
generative AI-fueled attention economy has broken that illusion. Feeds
are no longer crowded with people, but with content.
