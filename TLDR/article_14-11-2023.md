 GOOGLE WITNESS ACCIDENTALLY BLURTS OUT THAT APPLE GETS 36% CUT OF
SAFARI DEAL (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google pays Apple 36% of its search advertising revenue from Safari
to keep its search engine set as the default. Google and Apple had
objected to making this information public, but a witness from Google
let it slip during their testimony. It is unclear how much money this
amounts to, but it is estimated that Apple likely gets paid tens of
billions of dollars out of the deal. Google pays a total of $26
billion for its default contracts. 

 NVIDIA INTRODUCES THE H200, AN AI-CRUNCHING MONSTER GPU THAT MAY
SPEED UP CHATGPT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nvidia has revealed the HGX H200 Tensor Core GPU, a follow-up of the
H100GPU released last year. The H200 utilizes the Hopper architecture
to accelerate AI applications. It could lead to far more powerful AI
models and faster response times for existing ones. The lack of
computing power has been a major bottleneck for AI progress. Amazon
Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure will be the first cloud service providers to deploy
H200-based instances starting next year. The H200 will be generally
available starting in Q2 2024.

 JOBY, VOLOCOPTER FLY ELECTRIC AIR TAXIS OVER NEW YORK CITY (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Joby Aviation and Volocopter performed brief demonstration flights of
their electric aircraft in New York City over the weekend. New York
City Mayor Eric Adams wants to electrify two of the three heliports
located in Manhattan. The city aims to reduce emissions by 80% from a
2005 baseline by 2025. Joby is aiming to initially roll out a
commercial service in New York and Los Angeles as part of a
city-to-airport service deal with Delta Airlines. 

 DISRUPTING A SINGLE GENE COULD IMPROVE CAR T CELL IMMUNOTHERAPY, NEW
STUDY SHOWS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CAR T cell therapy is a powerful type of immunotherapy that has begun
to revolutionize cancer treatment. It involves engineering a patient's
T cells so they recognize and attack cancer cells. New research has
shown that disrupting a single gene in CAR T cells can make them more
potent and able to fight tumors longer. The approach improved the
therapy's effectiveness against multiple cancers in mice.

 üòò KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 If you've tried to build automated test coverage in-house, you know
it takes years to scale. Try QA Wolf [9] instead - they get web apps
to 80% test coverage in just 4 months. They will create and maintain
your test suite in open-source Playwright (no vendor lock-in, you own
the code), and provide unlimited parallel test runs on their
infrastructure.
The best part: QA Wolf saves you money. QA Wolf has multiple case
studies of customers saving at least $200k/year in QA engineering and
infrastructure costs. Schedule a demo to learn more. [9]

 OPENGPTS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 This repository is an effort to create a similar experience to
OpenAI's GPTs. It allows developers to configure over 60 LLMs,
prompts, over 100 tools, vector databases, retrieval algorithms, and
chat history databases. The project uses LangChain, LangServe, and
LangSmith. 

 MY MENTAL MODEL FOR BUILDING AND USING LLM-BASED APPLICATIONS (7
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article presents a mental model of LLMs and how their
limitations can be overcome. A mental model of LLMs is needed to know
where they work well, where they don't, and how best to use them. Most
people already have a similar model for Google without realizing it -
it's assumed everyone knows how to talk to Google, but that wasn't
always the case. LLMs are basically like booksmart Harvard graduates
who can Google anything to answer any question you ask them.

 BAY AREA TECH COMPANY REPORTEDLY TRYING TO POACH GOOGLE WORKERS WITH
$10M PAY PACKAGES (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI recruiters are trying to poach senior researchers from
Google's AI teams with pay packages ranging from $5 million to $10
million. Workers joining the company will receive stock that could
potentially quickly triple in value. They will also receive large
stock grants later on. The movement of employees is not only one way -
some employees have jumped in the other direction from OpenAI to
Google as well. 

 THE RIGHT-TO-REPAIR MOVEMENT IS JUST GETTING STARTED (20 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Apple came out in support of a right-to-repair bill in California in
August. The Right to Repair Act guarantees everyone access to parts,
tools, and manuals for fixing their electronic devices. Apple had
pledged to honor the new law nationwide, but its newest iPhone release
appears impossible to fully repair without paying Apple money. This
article looks at the right-to-repair movement and how the industry is
responding to it.
