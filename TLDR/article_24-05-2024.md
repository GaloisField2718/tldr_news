 SEC APPROVES RULE CHANGE TO ALLOW CREATION OF ETHER ETFS (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The SEC has approved a rule change that paves the way for ETFs that
buy and hold ether. The commission approved bitcoin ETFs less than six
months ago - those funds have proven a big success for the industry.
Many of the companies that sponsor bitcoin ETFs have already started
the process of launching an ether fund. The approval of ether ETFs is
a sign that the SEC's stance toward crypto may be softening. The
approval for ether ETFs does not extend to other crypto projects on
the Ethereum network.

 A GRAND UNIFIED THEORY OF THE AI HYPE CYCLE (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The AI industry has seen several hype cycles throughout the decades,
each producing genuinely useful technology and lasting longer than the
last. Every cycle follows the process of a sigmoid curve rather than
an exponential one. All strategies for developing the technology
inevitably have a limit that doesn't take too long to find. While the
current AI hype cycle is unlike any that have come before it, it will
likely follow a similar trajectory as previous cycles.
