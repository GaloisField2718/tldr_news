 EVERYTHING ANNOUNCED AT APPLE'S LET LOOSE IPAD EVENT (6 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Apple's Let Loose showcase was all about the iPad. The next iPad Pro
will be powered by an M4 chip. It will use a new display tech called
Tandem OLED, which layers two OLED panels on top of each other to
provide richer colors and deeper blacks. The iPad Air is now available
in 11 inches and 13 inches. The Apple Pencil Pro features a new
squeeze gesture and supports rotation. The new Magic Keyboard, which
is only compatible with the iPad Pro, features a larger trackpad with
haptic feedback as well as a row of function keys. 

 TIKTOK SUES TO BLOCK U.S. BAN (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TikTok has filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality
of the new law requiring the sale or ban of the company. The suit
seeks a court order preventing the US from enforcing the law. It
accuses the US of trampling on TikTok's First Amendment rights under
the banner of national security. Parent company ByteDance says it
can't and won't sell its US operations by the deadline, leaving
litigation as its best hope to remain in the US market. It claims to
have taken measures to safeguard user data and prevent Chinese
influence.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SOME CASES OF ALZHEIMER'S CAUSED BY TWO COPIES OF A SINGLE GENE (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have identified a genetic form of late-in-life
Alzheimer's disease that occurs in people who inherit two copies of
the APOE4 gene. The gene has been associated with the disease as a
risk factor for Alzheimer's for years. A recent study suggests that
having two copies of the gene is an underlying cause of Alzheimer's
rather than just a risk factor. An estimated 15% of Alzheimer's
patients carry two copies of APOE4. The gene can make symptoms begin
seven to 10 years sooner than in other adults, but it also makes
patients more prone to the dangerous side effects of some drug
treatments. The discovery allows researchers to develop gene therapy
or drugs specifically targeting the gene. 

 BASE POWER COMPANY (78 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The power industry is bottlenecked by the grid - adding more
renewables and electrifying more things will only make the grid less
stable. The grid is buckling due to the increasing use of variable
sources of electricity, decreasing grid reliability, increasing delays
in building electrical infrastructure, and increasing demand for
electricity. The Base Power Company is trying to fix this problem by
deploying connected batteries across the grid. These batteries will
store energy for use when needed, reducing strain on the grid.

 DENIABLE ENCRYPTION (27 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Deniable encryption is a concept where messages are encrypted in such
a way that using a different key would reveal a different message.
Theoretically, it allows people to reveal their keys without spilling
their secrets. This blog post proposes a method for building a
deniable encryption scheme that allows multiple passwords and
messages. The full code for the method is provided. 

 HEADLESS UI V2.0 FOR REACT (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Headless UI v2.0 for React features built-in anchor positioning, a
new checkbox component, HTML form components, combobox list
virtualization, a new website, improved docs, and improved hover,
focus, and active state detection. The improvements are aimed at
helping developers write less code and making the developer experience
even better. This article details the most interesting new
improvements. An upgrade guide is available for those transitioning
from v1.x.

 LPCAMM2 IS FINALLY HERE, AND IT'S A BIG DEAL (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 LPCAMM2 is a totally modular, repairable, and upgradeable memory
standard for laptops. It allows consumers to buy laptops and then
install more RAM as needed. LPCAMM2 supports the latest LPDDR chips
for maximum speed and efficiency. This article presents a teardown of
Lenovo's ThinkPad P1 (Gen 7), the first laptop to support LPCAMM2
technology. While the technology is arriving initially in a Lenovo
product, it owes its existence to an alliance of tech companies
working together over the course of several years. 

 WE'VE BEEN PUT IN THE VIBE SPACE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Search and recommendation have traditionally been kept separate,
because while they occupy opposite ends of the same spectrum
conceptually, they have different tooling, architectures, and machine
learning goals. Large language models introduce expectations that need
to be managed carefully because it is hard to guide customer intent in
an open-ended solution space. This may be frustrating for consumers
until specific LLM use cases are sorted out and made less general.
