TLDR 2025-12-02

 GOODBYE, LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native solution provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA
cycle to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks [6]—not years
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs [7]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of engineers [8] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

 APPLE TO REVAMP AI TEAM AFTER ANNOUNCING TOP EXECUTIVE'S DEPARTURE (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Apple's senior vice president in charge of AI strategy has stepped
down. His duties will be split among other senior vice presidents
responsible for software engineering, services, and operations. Amar
Subramanya, who was involved with developing Google's Gemini chatbot,
will join Apple as vice president of AI. The reorganization signals a
new era for Apple's AI work, which has so far failed to keep up with
the industry. 

 DEEPSEEK DEBUTS NEW AI MODELS TO RIVAL GOOGLE AND OPENAI (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 DeepSeek has unveiled two new models. The startup claims
DeepSeek-V3.2 matches the performance of OpenAI's GPT-5 across
multiple reasoning benchmarks. DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale is designed for
mathematical computations and matches the performance of Google's
Gemini-3 Pro. It also performed at gold medal levels on the
International Math Olympiad.

 SAMSUNG REVEALS GALAXY Z TRIFOLD, CONFIRMS US LAUNCH IN EARLY 2026 (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is set to launch in the US early next
year. Its inner display measures 10 inches across. The phone's specs
are overall pretty similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 7, though the battery
is quite a bit bigger at 5,600 mAh. The device will come only in
'Crafted Black'. It only measures 3.9mm at its thinnest unfolded
point. When folded up, the device measures 12.9mm thick, which is
markedly thinner than the Galaxy Z Fold 5, which was only released two
years ago. 

 NEURALINK'S FIRST PATIENT COULD RECEIVE AN UPGRADE (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Neuralink is considering an upgrade for its first human patient.
Since receiving the implant, the patient has been able to play games,
attend classes, and work. He is currently studying neuroscience and
maintaining good grades, something that would be impossible without
Neuralink. An upgrade would allow him to perform even more
sophisticated tasks using only his mind.

 DATADOG RESEARCH: 59% OF IAM USERS HAVE ACCESS KEYS OLDER THAN ONE
YEAR (SPONSOR) [14] 

 Long-lived credentials remain the most common cause of publicly
documented cloud breaches — yet organizations are struggling to
eliminate them. Datadog's State of Cloud Security 2025 [14] report
analyzes security posture data from thousands of organizations using
AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Get the data on credential risks, IMDSv2
adoption, overprivileged workloads, and more. Read the full report

 PUNYCODE: MY NEW FAVORITE ALGORITHM (45 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Punycode is a special encoding used to convert Unicode characters to
ASCII. It's deceptively simple on the surface, but there's real
sophistication in how it manages the problems inherent in encoding
arbitrary Unicode within DNS' ASCII-only infrastructure. The algorithm
uses adaptive bias adjustment, variable-length encoding, and delta
compression to achieve extremely dense results. This article looks at
how to encode arbitrary Unicode within DNS's ASCII-only
infrastructure. It provides a step-through visualizer at the end that
lets readers watch the algorithm encode domains from various scripts. 

 TREAT TEST CODE LIKE PRODUCTION CODE (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The same coding standards applied to production code should also be
applied to test code. Test code needs to be readable, well-factored,
and reviewed, just like production code. Good code makes it easier for
people working on the code to read, understand, and update. Applying
coding standards and design principles to test code makes
maintainability easier.

 COLLEGE STUDENTS FLOCK TO A NEW MAJOR: AI (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Interest in understanding, using, and learning how to build AI
technologies is soaring. Schools are racing to meet rising student and
industry demand. Dozens of universities and colleges in the US have
announced new AI departments, majors, minors, courses,
interdisciplinary concentrations, and other programs. Students hope
that the AI branding will open up more job opportunities. 

 INSTAGRAM MANDATES TOTAL RETURN TO OFFICE FOR EMPLOYEES IN 2026 (2
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Instagram employees will be required to return to the office
beginning February 2. Employees will still be able to work remotely
when needed, but they have been asked to use their best judgment on
when to take advantage of that flexibility. Other planned changes
intended to make Instagram more nimble and creative next year include
the scaling back of recurring meetings and a faster process for
unblocking and decision-making. While executives insist that in-person
work has important benefits, employees often disagree.
