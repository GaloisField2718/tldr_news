 WHEN DID MSP START MEANING MISERABLE SERVICE PROVIDER? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Every day we hear from companies who are disappointed because their
MSPs:

	* Lack proactivity, resulting in little improvement over time
	* Continuously charge more and sometimes for every change
	* Offer no security visibility, keeping C-level executives up at
night

ThreatSpike [4] is disrupting the MSP market with a new model [4] that
offers:

→ A roadmap to GREAT IT with measurable progress every day 
→ Visionary TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS enabling the business and its users

→ FULL SECURITY visibility and proactive protection 
→ 24/7 GLOBAL SUPPORT 
→ FIXED PRICE [4] per user (yes, really)

 ALIBABA'S MAIN AI APP DEBUTS STRONGLY IN EFFORT TO RIVAL CHATGPT (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Alibaba's Qwen app drew more than 10 million downloads in the week
after its relaunch. The company will gradually add agentic AI features
to support online shopping in the coming months. Alibaba has rebranded
itself as an AI-first business. It plans to deeply integrate core
lifestyle and productivity services directly into the Qwen app. 

 ELON MUSK'S BORING COMPANY REVEALS PRUFROCK TBM'S MOST DISRUPTIVE
FEATURE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Boring Company's Prufrock-5 tunnel boring machine (TBM) will
begin tunneling by December 1. One of the key features of the Prufrock
machines is that they can be retrieved, upgraded, and deployed again
with improvements. Standard TBMs are often left underground at the end
of projects because retrieving them is usually too expensive and
impractical. TBMs from the Boring Company could eventually be as
reusable as SpaceX's boosters.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 MAPPING THE SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Interoception is a sense that supplies the brain with a remarkably
rich picture of what is happening throughout the body. It shapes our
emotions, behavior, decisions, and feelings. A growing body of
research suggests that many psychiatric conditions may be caused in
part by errors in our perception of our internal environment.
Scientists still need to develop a firm understanding of how
interoception works, but someday it may be possible to treat some
conditions by returning a person's internal sense. 

 BRAIN HAS FIVE ‘ERAS', SCIENTISTS SAY – WITH ADULT MODE NOT
STARTING UNTIL EARLY 30S (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The brain experiences five major phases, split up by four pivotal
turning points (at around the ages of nine, 32, 66, and 83 years) in
which brain organization moves on to a different trajectory.
Understanding the brain's structural journey helps scientists identify
when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption. It could also
give insights into risk factors for mental health disorders, which
most frequently emerge during the adolescent period. An overview of
the five stages is available in the article.

 NEARLY HALF OF DEVELOPERS THINK THEIR SKILLS WON'T SURVIVE AI. HERE'S
HOW LEADERS CAN HELP (SPONSOR) [9] 

 That anxiety is real. This guide from Appfire [9] draws on data from
3,000+ developers to show how leaders can support teams through AI
adoption without burning them out. The DEVELOPER THRIVING FRAMEWORK
covers the culture patterns that predict burnout, how to build
confidence during transitions, and practical steps to support
learning. Download the guide [9] 

 NEW GEMINI API UPDATES FOR GEMINI 3 (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Gemini 3 is now available for developers to build with via the Gemini
API. Google has rolled out several updates to the API to support
Gemini 3's state-of-the-art reasoning, autonomous coding, multimodal
reasoning, and agentic capabilities. The changes are designed to give
users more control over how the model reasons, how it processes media,
and how it interacts with the outside world. Details are available in
the article. 

 WHAT A CTO SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TECH (27 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Tech leaders should take the time to learn what they need to know
about tech to be effective. Their job as a CTO is to make decisions in
an extremely complicated environment and under conditions of
considerable uncertainty. It's really important to understand clearly
what tools and what teams are working with. A lack of understanding
will eventually cause a messy crash.

 TECH PREDICTIONS FOR 2026 AND BEYOND (24 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Technology has become so intertwined with day-to-day life that it
influences everything, from our relationships to the way we work,
protect ourselves, and even the things we choose to learn and when.

human loop. This cycle will create massive opportunities to solve
problems that truly matter. 

 THE MATH OF WHY YOU CAN'T FOCUS AT WORK (37 MINUTE READ) [13]

unless you deliberately design for it. Just one less interruption per
hour each day can transform your week. Learn how to split up tasks
into smaller chunks. This post presents a model for increasing focus
at work.
