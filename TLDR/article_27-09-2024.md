 APPLE'S LONG-AWAITED ‚ÄòHOMEACCESSORY' COULD HAVE SQUARE DISPLAY, A18
CHIP FOR AI, MORE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Details about Apple's rumored new home accessory have been leaked.
The device, codenamed J490, combines the capabilities of the iPad,
Apple TV, and HomePod. It will be powered by the A18 chip, presumably
to support Apple Intelligence features. The device currently has a
squarish display - it is unclear whether the square aspect ratio will
make it to the final product. It has a built-in camera that works for
FaceTime and other video conferencing apps. The camera can identify
hand gestures from a distance and identify users to enable personal
requests. More details about the device are available in the article.

its product in October 2020, hitting one million subscribers in
December 2022. Its constellation now comprises nearly 6,000
satellites, which service companies and individuals in nearly 100
countries.

 STEM CELLS REVERSE WOMAN'S DIABETES ‚Äî A WORLD FIRST (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A 25-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes has started producing her
own insulin less than three months after receiving a transplant of
reprogrammed stem cells. A year after the transplant, she can now eat
sugar and enjoy eating everything. The surgery has completely reversed
diabetes in the patient, who previously required substantial amounts
of insulin. While the results are positive, they still need to be
replicated in more people, and the researchers want to wait five more
years before considering the patient as 'cured'. 

 RADIAN AEROSPACE COMPLETES GROUND TESTS OF PROTOTYPE SPACE PLANE (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Radian Aerospace has announced the completion of a series of ground
tests for its reusable space plane, which will be able to take off
from airfields and land on runways like conventional airplanes. The
tests were completed with a subscale prototype flight vehicle. They
aimed to generate data on how the vehicle would fly and handle and to
compare the data to simulations. While the vehicle did not fly, it did
perform a series of small hops. The prototype vehicle is much smaller
than the final vehicle, but the data will help inform key pieces of
the final design and flight control systems.

 POSTGRESQL 17 RELEASED! (5 MINUTE READ) [9]

improvements for high concurrency workloads, speedups in bulk loading
and exports, and query execution improvements for indexes. It also has
features that benefit brand-new workloads and critical systems. This
article covers the highlights of the new release.

 WORDPRESS.ORG BANS WP ENGINE, BLOCKS IT FROM ACCESSING ITS RESOURCES
(7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 WordPress.org has banned WP Engine from accessing its resources. The
ban prevents WP Engine customers from accessing security updates,
leaving them vulnerable. WP Engine is now working on fixes. The
company claims that WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg is misusing
his control of WordPress to interfere with WP Engine's customers'
access to WordPress.org. 

 CRITICAL MASS AND TIPPING POINTS: HOW TO IDENTIFY INFLECTION POINTS
BEFORE THEY HAPPEN (26 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The concept of critical mass can be used to understand everything
from viral cat videos to why changing habits is so hard. Sometimes, it
can seem as if drastic changes happen at random, but there is a logic
to these occurrences that can be explained by the concept of critical
mass - the point at which something is prevalent enough to grow or
sustain a process, reaction, or technology. The concept can help us
understand the world around us by letting us spot changes before they
occur. A firm understanding can help give people an edge in launching
products, changing habits, and choosing investments.
