 OCTOVERSE: AI LEADS PYTHON TO TOP LANGUAGE AS THE NUMBER OF GLOBAL
DEVELOPERS SURGES (35 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Developers are building AI models into applications and engaging with
AI projects on GitHub in large numbers. Python overtook JavaScript as
the most popular language on GitHub in 2024 and Jupyter Notebooks use
skyrocketed. Both are technologies heavily used in data science and
machine learning. The number of developers on GitHub has rapidly grown
since tools like GitHub Copilot started going mainstream in early

 CREATING AN LLM-AS-A-JUDGE THAT DRIVES BUSINESS RESULTS (51 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 This article discusses how to avoid creating bad evaluation
processes. It introduces a technique called 'Critique Shadowing' for
streamlining AI evaluation processes. Critique Shadowing involves
finding a principal domain expert, creating datasets, and having the
domain expert review the data and fix errors before building the LLM
judge and performing an error analysis. The process repeats
periodically or when material changes occur. The real value of the
process is that it tricks people into looking at their data and
performing careful analysis.
