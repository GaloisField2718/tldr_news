 EXCESSIVE CAFFEINE MAY BE HOLDING YOU BACK. TRY MUD\WTR (SPONSOR) [5]


 It's not coffee. It‚Äôs not even mushroom coffee.
The original blend is a combination of organic cacao, masala chai and
functional mushrooms that's low on caffeine and big on benefits [5].
You get focus, natural energy, and immune support, without the
jitters, crash or dependency you get from too much coffee.

Plus, it tastes amazing [5]‚Äîlike a chai latte and a hot cocoa had a
baby.

Give it a try. [5] You may just love it, like the more than 40,000
other folks who rated it 5 stars. Get started for less than $1 [5] per

 MICROSOFT‚ÄôS GAMING CHIEF ON XBOX GAMES COMING TO PS5, NEXT-GEN
HARDWARE, AND MORE (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft is bringing four Xbox-exclusive games to PS5 and Nintendo
Switch. The move is part of an 'Xbox Everywhere' effort that will
likely see even more games arriving on rival consoles. While there are
risks to going fully multiplatform, Microsoft sees an opportunity to
make more money on rival consoles to support its game creation. This
article contains an interview with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer
where he talks about the future of Xbox gaming, regulatory efforts
against Apple that could affect the Xbox business, and next-gen Xbox
hardware. 

 GEMINI 1.5 IS GOOGLE‚ÄôS NEXT-GEN AI MODEL ‚Äî AND IT‚ÄôS ALREADY
ALMOST READY (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has launched Gemini 1.5, making it available to developers and
enterprise users ahead of a full consumer rollout. The new Gemini is
apparently on par with the high-end Gemini Ultra that Google recently
launched. It was created using the Mixture of Experts technique,
making the model both faster for users and more efficient for Google
to run. Gemini 1.5 has a context window of 1 million tokens,
equivalent to tens of thousands of lines of code. Google researchers
are currently testing a 10 million context window.

might unveil the laptop at this year's Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona, which starts on February 26. Transparent display technology
is a rising trend, with several companies showing off semi-transparent
TVs at this year's CES. A render of Lenovo's rumored transparent
laptop is available in the article.

spend about eight days traveling before descending to the Moon's
surface on February 22. If all goes well, Intuitive Machines aims to
operate the lander on the surface for up to seven days. This is the
second mission under NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services
initiative.

 ARE THERE ANY GOOD REASONS TO USE C++ OVER RUST FOR NEW PROJECTS
TODAY? (LOBSTERS THREAD) [13] 

 This thread discusses contexts where using C++ makes more sense than
using Rust, things people new to Rust should watch out for when
starting new projects, and things that those considering making Rust
their go-to language should be aware of. It increasingly looks like
Rust can solve all of the problems that C++ can without losing
performance while gaining better memory safety guarantees and better
type invariance guarantees. However, there are still several reasons
to stick with C++, for example, Q2 and Unreal Engine require C++ and
platform support for Rust is still limited.

 BLUESKY AND MASTODON USERS ARE HAVING A FIGHT THAT COULD SHAPE THE
NEXT GENERATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A developer recently released a bridge to connect Bluesky's AT
Protocol with Mastodon's ActivityPub. The networks use two different
protocols, meaning that their users can't natively interact. The
release appeared to be controversial - it triggered an intense debate
on the project's GitHub issue page. Integrating the protocols together
could mean that users' posts show up in places they didn't anticipate.
The way that these protocols interact with one another could set the
stage for the next era of the internet. 

 APPLE CONFIRMS IT‚ÄôS BREAKING IPHONE WEB APPS IN THE EU ON PURPOSE
(5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apple says it broke progressive web apps (PWAs) in the iOS 17.4 beta
due to complexities involved with the Digital Markets Act's
requirement to allow different browser engines. PWAs typically allow
web apps to function and feel like native iOS apps. They now open like
a bookmark saved to the Home Screen. PWAs no longer have dedicated
windowing, notifications, or long-term storage. The changes will apply
to all users in the EU beginning in March.
