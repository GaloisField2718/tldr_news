 SPACEX'S STARSHIP TEST COMPLETES WITH A REMARKABLE ‘CHOPSTICK'
BOOSTER CATCH (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX's Super Heavy booster was caught by a launch tower using arms
that the company has nicknamed the 'chopsticks' at the completion of
Starship's fifth flight test yesterday. The remarkable catch was an
important step towards making the Super Heavy booster a fully reusable
launch system. Starship splashed down in the Indian Ocean a little
over an hour after launch. A short clip of the booster being caught by
the launch tower is available in the article. 

 WORDPRESS.ORG'S LATEST MOVE INVOLVES TAKING CONTROL OF A WP ENGINE
PLUGIN (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 WordPress.org has taken over the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin,
a popular WP Engine plugin. It claims the move was intended to remove
commercial upsells and fix a security problem. WordPress co-founder
Matt Mullenweg claims that the move was related to WP Engine's
recently-filed lawsuit against him and Automattic. Those who aren't WP
Engine, Flywheel, or ACF Pro customers will need to go to the ACF site
and download the genuine 6.3.8 version to keep getting updates.

 TWO PEOPLE COMMUNICATE IN DREAMS: INCEPTION MOVIE-STYLED SCI-FI
TURNED INTO REALITY (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Lucid dreams could unlock new dimensions of communication.
Researchers at REMspace recently demonstrated that people can
communicate in their dreams. Participants in REMspace's study were
able to send and receive messages through a server that recorded their
brain waves and other polysomnographic data during REM sleep. The
company plans to release a device that accurately tracks all sleep
stages for customers to view on a mobile app by 2025. 

 SCIENTISTS FOUND A WAY TO MAKE SOUND TRAVEL IN ONLY ONE DIRECTION (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Waves tend to flow equally in both directions. This can cause
interference, garbling signals or reducing efficiency. Researchers at
ETH Zurich have figured out how to direct sound waves so that they
only travel forward without weakening the sound's strength. This feat
could have vast implications for future technologies, from
communications systems to radar.

 zzz is a framework for writing performant and reliable networked
services in Zig that focuses on modularity and portability. It allows
developers to swap in their own implementations for various things,
allowing for maximum flexibility. zzz can be used in standard servers
as well as embedded/bare metal domains. While it is generally stable,
it is still in alpha and there is still a lot changing.

 MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE (2 HOUR READ) [14] 

 In this post, Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, talks about how AI
could transform the world for the better. He sketches out what the
world might look like with a powerful AI if everything goes right. The
effects of powerful AI are likely to be even more unpredictable than
past technological changes. The list of positive applications of
powerful AI is extremely long - this post focuses on a small number of
areas that have the greatest potential to directly improve the quality
of human life. 

 HAVE WE REACHED PEAK HUMAN LIFE SPAN? (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While life expectancies have generally increased in the last few
decades, the rate at which they are increasing is slowing down. This
suggests that humans could be closing in on the limits of what's
possible for average life span. The only thing that might radically
lengthen life expectancy may be an intervention that slows the aging
process itself, something some scientists are optimistic about.
