 INSTAGRAM CONFIRMS TEST OF ‚ÄòUNSKIPPABLE' ADS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Instagram is testing unskippable ads. The ads display a countdown
timer and stop users from being able to browse through more content on
the app until they view the ad. Instagram has shifted over the years
to become more of a video-sharing network, so it makes sense that it
is considering becoming more like YouTube. The majority of reactions
to the feature have been negative.

MINUTE READ) [7]

individual investors. He manages an investment empire with holdings
worth at least $2.8 billion as of early this year. Much of the

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 MALE BIRTH CONTROL GEL IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE, NEW TRIAL FINDINGS SHOW
(13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A birth control gel for males, which contains testosterone and a
synthetic hormone called Nestorone that reduces sperm production, is
showing promise in clinical trials. Researchers recently presented
encouraging phase 2 trial results on the hormonal gel. The second part
of the two-part trial is still underway, but initial findings have
found that the contraceptive works faster than expected. On average,
the time for effective contraception was eight weeks. This article
also covers some other types of male birth control currently under
development. 

 FUSION TECH FINDS GEOTHERMAL ENERGY APPLICATION (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Quaise Energy plans to deploy gyrotron drills to vaporize rocks using
powerful microwaves to dramatically reduce the costs and timelines of
drilling to fantastic depths. Gyrotrons use high-power linear-beam
vacuum tubes to generate millimeter-length electromagnetic waves. The
technology is used in nuclear fusion research to heat and control
plasma. It could make technologies like geothermal energy viable in
more areas of the planet.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 MESOP (WEBSITE) [10] 

 Mesop is a Python-based UI framework that allows developers to
rapidly build web and internal apps. It allows developers to write UI
in idiomatic Python code without writing JavaScript, CSS, or HTML.
Mesop features ready-to-use components, hot reload, rich IDE support,
and more. A demo gallery built in pure Mesop is available. 

 ANNOUNCING BRIOCHE! (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Brioche is a package manager and build tool designed to be flexible
and easy to use. It leverages TypeScript for fancy type-checking and
autocompletion. Brioche is currently in Technical Preview and limited
to x86-64 Linux. This post includes an example Brioche project file to
help developers get started.

 SEEING LIKE A DATA STRUCTURE (33 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Technology has become entangled with the structure of society and we
can no longer see the world around us without it. Our data-centric way
of seeing the world isn't serving us well. Tools are controlled by
human users, whereas machines only do what their designers want.
Technologists should build tools rather than machines. Seeing like a
data structure is a choice and there are different paths we can take. 

 THE END OF SOFTWARE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Media behaved very differently before the internet. It was expensive
to create and distribute. The internet reduced the cost of creating
content to zero, allowing a lot of user generated content to be
created as creating content didn't cost anything anymore. Content
behaved differently once it no longer had to make money. Software is
expensive because developers are expensive. Large language models
could drive the cost of creating software to zero - this will likely
result in a Cambrian explosion of software, similar to what happened
with content.

 WHY I RETIRED FROM THE TECH CRUSADES (4 MINUTE READ) [16]

it works and allow them to conclude by themselves what the better
choice is.
