 OPENAI RELEASES O1, ITS FIRST MODEL WITH ‚ÄòREASONING' ABILITIES (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has released o1 and o1-mini, the first in a series of
reasoning models that have been trained to answer more complex
questions faster than a human can. The model is better at writing code
and solving multistep problems than previous models, but it is more
expensive for developers and slower to use than GPT-4o. The release is
still in preview to indicate how nascent it is. ChatGPT Plus and Team
users should already have access to the model, while Enterprise and
Edu users will get access early next week. OpenAI plans to bring
o1-mini access to all free users, but it hasn't set a release date
yet. 

 SPACEX ASTRONAUTS CONDUCT SPACEWALK, PUTTING NEW SPACESUITS TO TEST
(5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The private-citizen astronauts traveling with SpaceX have completed
the first-ever commercial spacewalk. The spacewalk kicked off shortly
after 6 am ET on Thursday. The livestream showed tech industry
billionaire Jared Isaacman leaving the SpaceX Crew Dragon and
conducting a series of mobility tests before coming back after around
an hour. The entire spacecraft was exposed to the vacuum of space
during the spacewalk. The crew members were wearing SpaceX-designed
and manufactured suits that were previously untested in orbit. A clip
from the livestream is available in the article.

 FACE TO FACE WITH FIGURE'S NEW HUMANOID ROBOT (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figure's humanoid robots were put to work at BMW's Spartanburg, South
Carolina plant for a couple of weeks earlier this year - they will be
returning for good in January. The automotive industry has been eager
to adopt the humanoid robot form factor, which is in line with its
deployment of robots on factory floors. Figure aims to hit a
sub-$20,000 price point, but it will take some time. In the meanwhile,
the company is testing its robot's efficacy in helping out with tasks
around the home. This article features a video of Figure's
second-generation robot up close. 

 GOOGLE DEEPMIND TEACHES A ROBOT TO AUTONOMOUSLY TIE ITS SHOES AND FIX
FELLOW ROBOTS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google DeepMind researchers recently released a paper showcasing a
method for teaching robots to perform a range of dexterous tasks. It
used a new learning platform called ALOHA Unleashed paired with a
simulation program, DemoStart, to teach robots by watching humans. The
research showcased how systems can learn to perform complex, dexterous
tasks from a visual demonstration. Videos of robots trained with the
method performing tasks are available in the article.

 HOW GITHUB TAUGHT ME TO MICROMANAGE (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Good feedback cultivates quality work and professional growth - bad
feedback degrades quality and erodes relationships. Bad feedback makes
critiques but doesn't offer a better direction. OK feedback provides
direction. Good feedback educates to produce a better result. All of
this depends on context - detailed feedback may be welcomed in circles
where people are trying to improve others around them, but it can be
toxic in environments where few people care about craft.

 THE SUCCESS OF BLACK MYTH: WUKONG AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR MEDIA (8
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Black Myth Wukong is one of the fastest-selling games of all time.
The game cost $70 million to make and has grossed close to $1 billion
so far. The rise of regionally rooted AAA video games has been slower
than in film due to their comparatively high production cost, the rate
of technological, creative, and change, and a smaller market. The
growing capability and ease of use of game engines as well as the
affordability and size of asset store libraries will result in a
growing number of hits that target non-Western regions, countries, and
cultures, some of which will go far beyond those markets. 

 THE BUTTON PROBLEM OF AI (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Productivity software tends to buttonify AI into small, discrete
tasks because most models are currently incapable of building and
following complex plans as independent agents. Project builders are
forced to bind models to tasks that are small and easily definable
because they aren't able to handle knowledge-labor workflows in their
totality. Simply replacing small portions of a workflow with a button
isn't enough to meaningfully change the work itself. The
buttonification of AI is a reminder that we are still in the 'training
wheels' phase of the supposed AI revolution.
