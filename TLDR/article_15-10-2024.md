 🆕 REAL-TIME PAYMENTS ARE PICKING UP PACE. THESE NEW TOOLS FROM
MODERN TREASURY WILL HELP YOU ADAPT TO A SHIFTING LANDSCAPE (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 $37 trillion in payments could transition to real-time by 2028. If
you're moving, tracking, or reconciling payments, you need to start
thinking about what this means for your infrastructure.

Modern Treasury has recently introduced new features to help companies
thrive in a real-time world:

	* Faster payments [4] with FedNow and RTP support at more banks,
recipient readiness checks, and automatic ACH fallback.
 	* Smart workflow tools including payment templates, AI-assisted
reconciliation [4], simplified cross-border payments, and more.
 	* Real-time visibility into balance updates and transaction tracking
across multiple systems.

 GOOGLE BACKS NEW NUCLEAR PLANTS TO POWER AI (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Big Tech companies are increasingly investing into nuclear power.
Google has committed to buying power generated by seven nuclear-power
reactors to be built by Kairos Power. The project aims to add 500
megawatts of nuclear power starting at the end of the decade. The
project site (or sites) have yet to be determined. Google will have
its data centers somewhere near the reactors, but it hasn't been
determined whether they will receive power directly from the plants or
from the grid. 

 OPENAI UNVEILS SECRET META PROMPT — AND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM
ANTHROPIC'S APPROACH (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has revealed the meta-prompt for its new o1 model family to
help developers improve and fine-tune their products. Meta-prompts are
used to instruct models to create good prompts based on user task
descriptions or to improve existing prompts. This article looks at
both OpenAI and Anthropic's approaches and compares them. The
companies are using very different engines and their prompts reveal a
lot about how each company thinks and what they expect from their
products. OpenAI conceptualizes ChatGPT as a powerful computational
tool while Anthropic envisions Claude as a friendly, human-like
assistant.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SCIENTISTS USE HUMAN STEM CELLS TO RESTORE A MONKEY'S VISION (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scientists successfully used human stem cells to patch a hole in a
monkey's retina, restoring the primate's vision. Macular holes, a
condition associated with aging, cause vision to blur and decline over
time. Current fixes for the condition come at the cost of a loss of
peripheral vision as they involve transplanting cells. Using stem
cells to repair the problem would introduce new cells, avoiding this
issue. More research is needed to determine whether the treatment is
suitable for human eyes. 

 SOLAR-POWERED DESALINATION SYSTEM REQUIRES NO EXTRA BATTERIES (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MIT engineers have built a solar-powered desalination system that
removes salt from water at a pace that closely follows changes in
solar energy. It automatically adjusts to any sudden variation in
sunlight, maximizing the utility of solar energy. The system can
produce large quantities of clean water regardless of sunlight
variation throughout the day without any batteries or supplemental
power supply. It is geared towards desalinating brackish groundwater,
a huge untapped source of potential drinking water.

 LODASH REPLACEMENTS (WEBSITE) [9] 

 This page contains a complete catalog of all the functions that
Lodash provides. For each function, it provides a description of how
to implement the same behavior in plain JavaScript. The page is still
a work in progress. 

 VORTEX (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Vortex is a toolkit for working with compressed Apache Arrow arrays
in-memory, on-disk, and over-the-wire. It is a highly extensible and
extremely fast framework for building a modern columnar file format.
Vortex features a state-of-the-art, batteries-included reference
implementation. It has dramatically faster random access reads and
scans than Apache Parquet while preserving approximately the same
compression ratio and write throughput.

 TERENCE TAO, MATHEMATICIAN: ‘IT'S NOT GOOD FOR SOMETHING AS
IMPORTANT AS AI TO BE A MONOPOLY HELD BY ONE OR TWO COMPANIES' (16
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article contains an interview with Terence Tao, indisputably one
of the best mathematicians in history. At 49, Tao, who was born in the
Australian city of Adelaide, received his doctorate from Princeton
University at 21 and was already a professor at the University of
California in Los Angeles at 24. In the interview, Tao discusses the
results from the recent presidential election in Venezuela, whether AI
is a threat that could destroy humanity, AI systems like AlphaProof
and AlphaGeometry, whether water could spontaneously explode and
destroy the world, and more. 

 CAPTURE LESS THAN YOU CREATE (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The success of others shouldn't diminish your satisfaction with your
own efforts. Working on open source means you will capture vanishingly
less than you create as you are offering software with no strings
attached to anyone who might wish to build. Thus, developers shouldn't
feel envious of their users and their success. Having 'enough' is a
special kind of wealth.
