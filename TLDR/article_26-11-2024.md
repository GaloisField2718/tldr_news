 SPACEX: CELLULAR STARLINK SERVICE IS READY TO GO (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SpaceX now has enough satellites in Earth's orbit to offer commercial
services for its cellular Starlink system. The company now has over
320 'direct to cell' Starlink satellites in space. The service will
work with normal mobile phones without any extra equipment or special
apps. SpaceX is partnering with T-Mobile to offer cellular satellite
technology to consumers. The company still needs approval from the FCC
before it can operate a commercial cellular service. 

 'IPHONE 17 AIR' RUMORED TO SURPASS IPHONE 6 AS THINNEST IPHONE EVER
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The iPhone 17 Air will be around 6mm thick, according to rumors. This
will make it the thinnest iPhone ever. Most sources agree that it will
have around a 6.6-inch display. The device is expected to have a
standard A19 chip, a Dynamic Island, a single rear camera, and an
Apple-designed 5G modem. The iPhone 17 Air will likely be unveiled in
September 2025.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 MUSK'S NEURALINK LAUNCHES STUDY OF MIND-CONTROLLED ROBOTIC ARM (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Neuralink is starting to test a technology that could allow paralyzed
people to control a robotic arm. It is conducting an early-stage study
aimed at letting patients with Neuralink devices implanted in their
brains manipulate robotic arms. Neuralink's device allows patients to
control computer cursors, iPads, and similar digital tools. It is
currently implanted in at least two humans. 

 US SUPERSONIC JET SOARS TO RECORD 25,040 FEET, FUELS SPEEDY TRAVEL
DREAMS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Boom Supersonic's XB-1 demonstrator aircraft recently completed its
eighth flight and set a new altitude record. It reached an altitude of
25,040 feet during the 54 minute flight and a top speed of Mach 0.82,
tying its previous speed record. Boom Supersonic has planned a few
more subsonic flights before it will attempt to break the sound
barrier. While the XB-1 will be capable of exceeding Mach 1, the
company plans to fly its aircraft at Mach 0.94 over land to avoid the
disruptive noise caused by sonic booms.

 INTRODUCING THE MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new standard for
connecting AI assistants to data systems. It is aimed at helping
frontier models produce better, more relevant responses. MCP provides
a universal open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources,
resulting in a simpler, more reliable way to give AI systems access to
the data they need. It uses a straightforward architecture that allows
developers to either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI
applications that connect to these servers. 

 AMAZON S3 ADDS NEW FUNCTIONALITY FOR CONDITIONAL WRITES (1 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Amazon S3 can now perform conditional writes that evaluate if an
object is unmodified before updating it. This will help developers
coordinate simultaneous writes to the same object and prevent multiple
concurrent writers from unintentionally overwriting the object without
knowing the state of its content. Conditional writes simplify how
distributed applications with multiple clients concurrently update
data across shared datasets. The new conditional header can help
improve the efficiency of large-scale analytics, distributed machine
learning, and other highly parallelized workloads by offloading
compare and swap operations to S3. The new conditional-write
functionality is available at no additional charge in all AWS regions.

 THE PROBLEM WITH REASONERS (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 o1 reasoners are the most exciting models to come out since the
original GPT-4, but they suck on important problems. o1 uses a
reinforcement learning (RL) environment where reasoning steps are
actions, previous tokens are observations, and reward is the
solution's correctness. RL is great for games, high-frequency trading,
protein folding, and other problems, but not for open-ended thought
without clear feedback. RL-based reasoners struggle to perform in
domains outside of their training, which is most fields.
Transformative AI will likely come from scaling rather than through
reasoning models. 

 VALVE, STEAM, AND THE ENTIRE PC GAMING INDUSTRY WERE SAVED BY A
SINGLE INTERN (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Valve recently released a documentary to celebrate the Half-Life 2's
20th birthday. One of the facts shared in the documentary was that the
entire PC gaming industry as we know it today wouldn't have been
possible if it wasn't for a single Korean-speaking intern named
Andrew. Andrew found a document that proved that a company Valve was
fighting against in a lawsuit was destroying evidence related to the
case. The company had buried Valve in documents to slow down the
process, with many of the documents written in Korean. Andrew's
discovery helped Valve win the lawsuit, securing Valve the rights to
the Half-Life and Counter-Strike franchises, ultimately leading Steam
to evolve from a small software client into the largest digital
distribution platform and storefront.

 THE TWO FACTIONS OF C++ (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There's a growing rift between the two factions in C++ - those with
good tooling that can effortlessly build from source vs those with
poor tooling who can't build from source - that likely won't be
closing anytime soon.
