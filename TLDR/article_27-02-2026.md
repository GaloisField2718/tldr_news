 GOOGLE REVEALS NANO BANANA 2 AI IMAGE MODEL, COMING TO GEMINI TODAY
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nano Banana 2, also known as Gemini 3.1 Flash Image, delivers results
similar to Nano Banana Pro but with the speed of the non-pro Flash
variant. The new image generator has more advanced world knowledge,
which gives it the necessary information to render objects with
greater fidelity and create more accurate infographics. Nano Banana 2
will replace both the standard and Pro variants of Nano Banana across
the Gemini app, Search, AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Flow. Example images
generated with the model are available in the article. 

 NETFLIX DITCHES DEAL FOR WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY AFTER PARAMOUNT'S
OFFER IS DEEMED SUPERIOR (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Netflix is walking away from a deal to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's
(WBD) studio and streaming assets as its board deemed on Thursday that
a revised bid by Paramount is a superior offer. Paramount raised its
bid earlier this week to $31 per share in cash. Netflix had granted
WBD a seven-day waiver to re-engage with Paramount last week.
Paramount's offer is for the entirety of the company.

 OPENAI'S KEVIN WEIL ON THE FUTURE OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY (9 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's VP of Science, Kevin Weil, recently had an interview where
he discussed how AI capabilities are progressing to the future of
robotic labs, how founders should think about building with AI, and
why this might be the best moment in history to start a company. This
post contains highlights of the interview along with a link to a video
of the chat. Weil is now focused on accelerating scientific discovery
with AI. His previous experience includes leading product teams at
Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. 

 TOMORROW'S SMART PILLS WILL DELIVER DRUGS AND TAKE BIOPSIES (11
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Doctors may soon prescribe pills that can travel through the
digestive system and check for tissue health. Diagnosis for
gastrointestinal diseases is often complicated, and treatment can
bring serious side effects. Capsules are able to handle much of that
work and could even release drugs exactly where they're needed or snip
biopsy samples for analysis. The technology could transform care and
make screening for disease less invasive and more accessible.

 WHAT CLAUDE CODE ACTUALLY CHOOSES (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 As more developers let Claude Code handle tool selection, the stacks
that the AI chooses become 'the stack'. The model's training data may
shape market share more than a marketing budget or conference talk.
This study looks at what tools Claude Code actually picks. Claude Code
would rather build from scratch than use existing tools - custom
implementations are its single most common recommendation. 

 OPEN SOURCE IN THE AGE OF AI (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The dynamics of the software industry are rapidly changing. Some of
the foundations that open source was built on are looking increasingly
shaky. Open source maintainers have been fighting companies taking
their work and creating competing products for years by using
increasingly restrictive licenses or keeping certain parts of the
development stack private. However, AI is making it easier to clone
codebases into entirely new products. Software licenses may become
meaningless as AI becomes adept enough to rewrite open source
codebases from scratch without using any of the original code.

 ANTHROPIC CEO AMODEI SAYS PENTAGON'S THREATS ‘DO NOT CHANGE OUR
POSITION' ON AI (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, says that the company cannot, in good
conscience, agree to allow the Department of Defense to use its AI
models in all lawful use cases without limitations. The Department of
Defense wants to be able to use Anthropic's models without
restrictions on fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic
surveillance. Anthropic has refused to change its stance despite
threats by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to label it as a 'supply
chain risk' or invoke the Defense Production Act to force it to comply
with the department's demands. Discussions between the two parties are
still ongoing. 

 JACK DORSEY'S BLOCK TO LAY OFF 40% OF ITS WORKFORCE IN AI REMAKE (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Block plans to lay off 40% of its workforce - more than 4,000
employees. Founder Jack Dorsey alluded that AI tools were the reason
for the cuts in a letter to shareholders. He claims that the decision
to cut jobs wasn't because the company is in trouble. Block has
delivered mixed results in recent years as it faces tough competition.
