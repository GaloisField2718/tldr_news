READ) [5] 

 xAI is currently testing a standalone iOS app for its Grok chatbot in
Australia and a few other countries. The app can access real-time data
from the web and X. xAI is also preparing a dedicated site to make the
chatbot accessible on the web. Grok was previously only available to
X's paying subscribers, but the company rolled it out to all users for
free earlier this month. 

 M5 PRO CHIP COULD SEPARATE CPU AND GPU IN ‘SERVER GRADE' CHIPS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's System-on-a-Chip (SoC) design tightly integrates all
components, including both CPU and GPU, into a single package. TSMC's
latest chip packaging process, known as SoIC-mH
(System-on-Integrated-Chips-Molding-Horizontal), integrates different
chips into a package in a way that improves thermal performance,
allowing chips to run at full power for longer before they need to be
throttled back to reduce heat. This approach may be used for the Pro,
Max, and Ultra variants of the M5 chip. The M5 Pro chips will be used
to power Apple Intelligence servers.

 HOW HALLUCINATORY A.I. HELPS SCIENCE DREAM UP BIG BREAKTHROUGHS (9
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI hallucinations can be remarkably useful. Scientists are using them
to track cancer, design drugs, invent medical devices, uncover weather
phenomena, and even win the Nobel Prize. This article looks at how AI
hallucinations have been used to advance science. AI Hallucinations
are giving scientists the chance to explore ideas they might not have
thought about otherwise. 

 A LOOMING THREAT TO BITCOIN: THE RISK OF A QUANTUM HACK (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Quantum computing could one day enable hackers to break the
encryption that keeps bitcoin secure. A quantum device powerful enough
to do this is still likely a decade or more away. The technology poses
a long-term risk unless bitcoin's community of developers beef up its
technology. A breakthrough that threatens bitcoin's security would
also threaten many other industries, including traditional finance.

 MY COLLEAGUE JULIUS (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article tells the story of Julius, a guy who managed to succeed
through his way with words. Julius would receive praise for his work
despite knowing nothing about many of the things he worked on. People
believed him even when he said things that made no sense. More
knowledgeable people would be responsible for checking his work -
these people knew how poor the work was, but management liked him so
much they couldn't see it. His story is analogous to AI - Julius is
now everywhere.

 VENTURE CAPITAL PARTNERS ARE LEAVING BIG FIRMS IN DROVES (7 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Dozens of investors at some of the biggest venture capital firms quit
or were pushed out in 2024. An unusual number of investors are working
on new firms. This is being caused by a protracted startup downturn
and a broader shift in the role of VC firms. Bleak market conditions
have led to less funding and leaner operations, so it makes sense for
firms to employ fewer investors.
