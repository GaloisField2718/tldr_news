 APPLE PLOTS EXPANSION INTO AI ROBOTS, HOME SECURITY, AND SMART
DISPLAYS (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple is banking on an ambitious product road map to help get its AI
effort on track. It is working on a slate of new devices, including
robots, a lifelike version of Siri, a smart speaker with a display,
and home-security cameras. The centerpiece of the company's AI
strategy is a tabletop robot that serves as a virtual companion. Home
security is also seen as another big opportunity. 

 AMAZON LAUNCHES SAME-DAY DELIVERY OF MEAT, EGGS, PRODUCE IN MORE THAN
1,000 CITIES (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Amazon is rolling out same-day delivery of fresh foods to more than
1,000 cities and towns in the US. There are plans to reach at least
2,300 locations by the end of the year. The service is free for Prime
members for orders over $25 in most cities, or $2.99 for orders under
$25. Shoppers without a Prime membership pay $12.99 regardless of
order size.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THIS GOOGLE SPIN-OFF WANTS TO BEAM 100GBPS INTERNET FROM THE OCEAN,
MOUNTAINTOPS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Aalyria, a startup born from Alphabet's Loon internet balloon
project, successfully beamed a 100Gbps internet connection across 40
miles by harnessing optical lasers. The link has been operational for
several weeks. Aalyria's Tightbeam system can deliver high-speed
internet connections from the air. It is engineered for resilience in
dynamic weather conditions and has adaptive optics and tracking
algorithms to minimize the impact of transient environmental changes
to end users. Aalyria aims to deliver Tightbeam technology for land,
sea, air, and even satellite communications. 

 WHY CHINA IS BECOMING THE WORLD'S FIRST ELECTROSTATE (13 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 China installed more solar power in April than Australia has in all
of its history - and Australia is a global leader in the space. China
is embracing renewable technologies across every aspect of its society
at an astonishing rate. Its aim is to stop relying on imported fossil
fuels and fix the pollution caused by them. By putting its economic
might and willpower behind renewable technologies, China is
accelerating the end of the fossil fuel era and bringing about the age
of the electrostate.

 PYX (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 pyx is an optimized backend for uv that makes uv even faster, more
secure, and hardware-aware. It can be used to host private packages or
as a frontend to public sources like PyPI. pyx solves many of the
problems in uv that can't be solved with a client alone, but could be
solved with a server. It is not yet generally available, but the
development team is currently looking for more early users. 

 SSHRC (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 sshrc works just like ssh, but it also sources the ~/.sshrc on your
local computer after logging in remotely. It can be used to set
environment variables, define functions, and run post-login commands.
sshrc can be very useful for developers who share servers with
multiple users and can't edit the server's ~/.bashrc without affecting
them, or if they have several servers that they don't want to
configure independently.

 I'M WORRIED IT MIGHT GET REALLY BAD (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There are indicators that the US, and perhaps the rest of the world,
may experience a spontaneous recession type of thing in the next few
months or years. Really talented people are losing their jobs,
business leaders are explicitly saying they're looking to replace
human workers with AI, most workers aren't putting much effort in, and
the effects of tariffs haven't even fully hit yet. There are many
things happening right now, or that could happen soon, that could
combine to create a narrative of panic in a population that's just
barely holding on. 

 HUAWEI AI CHIP-POWERED DEEPSEEK R2 TIPPED TO LAUNCH THIS MONTH (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 DeepSeek R2 is expected to go official later this month. It is
expected to be an advanced Mixture-of-Experts model. The model will be
powered by the Huawei Ascend AI chip at launch. Analysts expect the
pricing of DeepSeek R2 to be significantly lower than that of OpenAI's
GPT-5, indicating it may subvert the pricing model of existing AI
services.
