 GOOGLE'S JARVIS AI EXTENSION EXISTENCE LEAKED ON THE CHROME STORE (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's Jarvis AI extension was leaked for a brief time on the
Chrome Web Store. The store page described Jarvis as a helpful
companion that surfs the web. It supposedly works by taking and
analyzing screenshots, similar to Apple's 'onscreen awareness' and
Microsoft Recall. The extension will likely go live after Gemini 2.0's
official release, which should be sometime next month. 

 OPENAI ACQUIRED CHAT.COM (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Chat.com now redirects to OpenAI's ChatGPT. The domain was registered
in September 1996. It was sold to HubSpot co-founder and CTO Dharmesh
Shah last year for $15.5 million. Shah sold the domain to OpenAI in
March. It is unknown how much the deal was worth. Shah implied that he
had been paid in OpenAI shares.

 SPACEX TO LAUNCH STARSHIP FOR THE SIXTH TIME THIS MONTH (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The sixth flight test of SpaceX's Starship may be as soon as November
18. It will have many of the same objectives as the previous test,
which is part of the reason for the fast approval. SpaceX will also
attempt to relight one of the Starship's six Raptor engines in orbit,
test new secondary thermal protection materials, and stress the limits
of flap control to gain data on future landing profiles. Its engineers
have introduced a number of upgrades to the system, including more
redundancy in the booster propulsion system and updated software
controls. 

 A NEW STRONGER OZEMPIC IS COMING. HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Novo Nordisk's CagriSema combines semaglutide, the active ingredient
in Ozempic and Wegovy, with an amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist.
Amylin helps regulate blood sugar levels while calcitonin controls
calcium levels in the blood. An early-stage clinical trial of
CagriSema found it helped patients lose more weight faster compared to
the highest dose of Wegovy. Late-stage trials of the drug are expected
later this year and in the first half of 2025.

 MONITORING DATABASE PERFORMANCE WITH MONGODB, AWS, AND DATADOG
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 With Datadog's MongoDB integrations, AWS customers can integrate
database metrics directly in Datadog dashboards for a more complete
visualization of what's happening across their MongoDB platform. By
correlating MongoDB with full-stack telemetry [9], you'll get better
visibility, stay ahead of issues with automated alerts, and more.

best practices. It provides a high-level view of best practices. Each
guardrail is contained in a YAML file for easy reading and sorting.

their technology/cloud/maturity. 

 HOW WEBSOCKETS COST US $1M ON OUR AWS BILL (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Inter-process communication (IPC) can result in enormous AWS bills if
done inefficiently. Recall.ai discovered that its Python WebSocket
client and Chromium's WebSocket implementations were calling two
functions that were taking up a majority of its CPU time. This article
looks at how the company discovered the issue, why it chose to use
WebSockets in the first place, and how it fixed the issue and reduced
the CPU usage of its bots by up to 50%. This exercise in optimizing
IPC for CPU efficiency reduced Recall.ai's AWS bill by over a million
dollars per year.

 TIKTOK CANADA UNIT ORDERED TO DISSOLVE OPERATIONS ON
NATIONAL-SECURITY CONCERNS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Canada has ordered TikTok Technology Canada to dissolve its business
operations due to national security concerns. TikTok says the order
would eliminate hundreds of jobs and isn't in anyone's best interest.
It will challenge the order in court. The Canadian government will not
be blocking citizens' access to the TikTok app or their ability to
post content on the platform. Banning the company and not the app
could make things worse as the risks associated with the app will
remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be
weakened. 

 ONCE THOUGHT A FANTASY, EFFORT TO SEQUENCE DNA OF MILLIONS OF SPECIES
GAINS MOMENTUM (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Earth BioGenome Project, which started six years ago, aims to
sequence the genomes of essentially all known eukaryotes. While the
project is still short on funds and years behind schedule, it is no
longer pure aspiration. The project has now sequenced 3,000 genomes
and is on track to reach 10,000 species by 2026. Project leaders now
hope to meet the 1.67 million species goal by 2032. Advances in DNA
sequencing technology will help lower the costs of the project.
