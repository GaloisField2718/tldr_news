 EPIC GAMES IS LAUNCHING WEBSHOPS TO ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO CIRCUMVENT
APP STORE FEES AFTER NEW RULING (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Epic Games Store's new webshops feature allows developers to open
webshops to offer players out-of-app purchases to circumvent fees from
Apple and Google. The company will not take a cut from the first $1
million each game earns annually starting in June. Epic is bringing
Fortnite back to the iOS App Store - it will incentivize users to buy
digital goods through Epic directly with cheaper prices.

 AURORA LAUNCHES COMMERCIAL SELF-DRIVING TRUCK SERVICE IN TEXAS (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Aurora Innovation is the first company to deploy driverless,
heavy-duty trucks for commercial use on public roads in the US. The
company began running freight this week between Dallas and Houston and
has completed 1,200 miles in a single self-driving truck without a
driver so far. It plans to build more trucks and expand to El Paso and
Phoenix by the end of the year. The company is working with Volvo
Trucks and Paccar to develop self-driving trucks for high-volume
manufacturing, with plans for a launch in 2027 or earlier. 

 THE BILLIONAIRE BUILDING SPACE LASERS TO POWER EARTH (9 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Aetherflux is a company that aims to harvest solar power in space and
beam it back to Earth via laser. It plans to launch a demonstration of
its technology in 2026. A solar farm in space would receive sunlight
all the time, enabling it to harness more power than on Earth.
Aetherflux plans to use infrared lasers to send solar energy from an
array of small satellites to a series of small ground stations. The US
military might be the first recipient of Aetherflux's space-based
power, but the company wants to be a commercially viable operation
that can provide clean, affordable power to Americans everywhere.

 HYPERPARAM OPEN-SOURCE (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Hyperparam addresses the lack of a user-friendly, scalable UI for
exploring and curating massive datasets in the machine learning
ecosystem through a suite of open-source tools that tackle different
aspects of data curation. It aims to empower ML practitioners to
create the best training datasets for the best models. The tools
include Hyparquet, a lightweight, pure-JS library for reading Apache
Parquet files directly in the browser; Hyparquet-Writer, which
provides a way to write or export data to Parquet format in
JavaScript; HighTable, a React-based virtualized table component for
viewing extremely large tables in the browser; and Icebird, which
extends Hyperparam's reach into data stored in Apache Iceberg format. 

 REDIS IS OPEN SOURCE AGAIN (2 MINUTE READ) [13]

than 30 performance improvements. The release adds eight more data
structures and five probabilistic structures to help developers solve
their current use cases better and build for the next generation of
fast and real-time apps. It comes with a new license (AGPLv3) that
makes Redis open source again.

 APPLE LIED UNDER OATH IN EPIC GAMES TRIAL, MAY FACE CRIMINAL CONTEMPT
CHARGES (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Apple VP of Finance Alex Roman allegedly lied to the court to
maintain the belief that evidence of internal discussions about a 27%
commission fee on some purchases linked to the App Store was real. The
company had presented evidence of internal discussions that were
tailor-made for litigation instead of what actually happened. Apple
has also been accused of other deceptive practices. The accusations
may result in punishment for Apple and Roman - the case has been
referred to US attorneys, who will investigate whether to pursue
criminal contempt proceedings. 

 OXIDE'S COMPENSATION MODEL: HOW IS IT GOING? (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Oxide struggled to hire four years ago, so it published a blog
explaining the company's approach to compensation. The blog got a lot
of attention, both positive and negative, and it resulted in a surge
of new people interested in working at the company. The company now
has over three times the employees it previously had and a shipping
product. This article looks at the lessons the company has learned
over the few years of working with its compensation model, which has
been essential for building a mission-focused team.
