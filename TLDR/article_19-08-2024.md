MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple plans to update its non-Pro AirPods lineup as early as next
month. There will be two versions of the fourth-gen AirPods: a
lower-priced model with basic functionality and a higher-priced
version with active noise cancellation. There will likely be design
changes to further distinguish the two models. The new AirPods will
likely have Spatial Audio features and Apple Watch charging using the
case, which will have USB-C. 

 EPIC GAMES STORE AND FORTNITE ARRIVE ON EU IPHONES (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Fortnite is now back on iOS, but only in the EU. Epic has launched
its games store on iOS (EU only) and Android. It currently only has
three games, but Epic is working on bringing developers into its
store. Fortnite was pulled from the Apple App Store four years ago,
resulting in a legal battle that loosened Apple's grip on its platform
but kept the status quo for the most part.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 DESIGNER BABIES ARE HERE ‚Äî SO WHY AREN'T WE TALKING ABOUT IT? (9
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While human prenatal genome editing, which involves editing the DNA
of a fetus visible inside the womb, has not happened yet as far as we
know, the societal implications of the technology are still vast. The
technology offers a chance to address cellular disease processes early
and prevent symptoms from ever appearing. However, there are many
ethical issues with using the technology. This article presents a
summary of the many issues surrounding human prenatal genome editing
and how it may affect society in the future. 

 THE INVISIBLE PROBLEM WITH SENDING PEOPLE TO MARS (11 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 There are obvious challenges to getting people to Mars, but the
biggest obstacle might be something that's totally invisible and often
overlooked: space radiation. Scientists are just beginning to learn
about the many ways that exposure to space radiation can impact human
health. The effects of space radiation may also combine with other
factors such as sleep deprivation and microgravity - there is not
enough information yet about how these factors interact. Finding ways
to mitigate these effects will determine whether people will ever be
able to visit Mars safely.

 ROBLOX IS ALREADY THE BIGGEST GAME IN THE WORLD. WHY CAN'T IT MAKE A
PROFIT (AND HOW CAN IT)? (29 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 More than 80 million people log into Roblox on average every day.
Despite its linear growth, which is expected to continue, Roblox is
very unprofitable. Its impressive rate of revenue growth has been
outpaced by its costs. The company loses 49% of its revenue to app
stores and content creators before it even gets into infrastructure
and other costs. Roblox is increasingly focused on using generative AI
and other features to attract more players, especially older players
with money to spend and the discretion to spend it. 

 SAM ALTMAN'S WORLDCOIN IS BATTLING WITH GOVERNMENTS OVER YOUR EYES
(13 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sam Altman's Worldcoin project has come under assault by authorities
all over the world. More than a dozen jurisdictions have either
suspended the project's operations or looked into its data processing.
Worldcoin verifies people by using their irises, which it claims are
better at distinguishing humans than fingerprints or faces. While the
company says its technology is completely private, authorities are
concerned that it could be used to build a global biometric database
with little oversight.
