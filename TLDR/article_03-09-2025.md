 WHAT A RULING TO FIX GOOGLE'S SEARCH MONOPOLY MEANS FOR THE COMPANY
(7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google is positioned to keep its Search business running largely
without interruption. The company will have to share more of its data
with competitors and create an oversight committee to monitor its
business practices, but it can continue many of the operations that
the government challenged in the antitrust lawsuit, including its
payments to Apple. Google sharing its data could help its competitors
improve their search products. The company will not be forced to
divest its Chrome browser. 

 ANTHROPIC RAISES $13 BILLION FUNDING ROUND AT $183 BILLION VALUATION
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has closed a $13 billion funding round at a $183 billion
post-money valuation. The round was led by Iconiq, Fidelity Management
& Research Co., and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Anthropic will use
the fresh capital to deepen safety research, meet growing enterprise
demand, and support international expansion. The company's run-rate
revenue recently reached more than $5 billion, up from roughly $1
billion at the beginning of the year.

 FUEL SUPPLY IS A BOTTLENECK FOR STARSHIP—HERE'S HOW SPACEX WILL GET
AROUND IT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Starship's scale dwarfs that of other rockets. It has a capacity for
more than a million gallons of super-cold liquid methane and liquid
oxygen propellants. While SpaceX aims to eventually be able to launch
at least one Starship a day, there are numerous bottlenecks to
achieving such a fast launch cadence. One of these is simple
logistics: it takes more than 200 tanker trucks traveling from distant
refineries to deliver all of the fuel needed for a Starship launch,
which takes time, emits pollution, and clogs roadways. 

 OPENAI FOR SCIENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI for Science is a project within OpenAI aimed at building an
AI-powered platform to accelerate scientific discovery. It aims to
prove that AI models are ready to accelerate fundamental science and
research all over the world. This thread shares several examples of
how GPT-5 has helped and advanced science. More about OpenAI for
Science will be unveiled in the coming months.

 THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN AI CODING DEMOS AND DAILY REALITY (15 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Some people may find it difficult to get the results they see others
getting with AI tools. This article discusses several tools and
specific techniques that have helped developers increase their
productivity. These techniques are scattered across documentation,
blog posts, and threads, so finding them requires knowing what to look
for. The article covers requirements and planning, UI, prototyping,
coding, debugging, testing, QA, and cross-stage techniques. 

 %CPU UTILIZATION IS A LIE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Viewing CPU utilization is easy - just pull up a system monitor tool.
However, trying to project these numbers is a bit more difficult -
whenever people try, they find that CPU utilization doesn't increase
quite linearly. This happens because of hyperthreading (the cores on
the machine are sharing resources with other cores) and Turbo, a
dynamic processor frequency adjustment technology used to increase
performance. Reported utilizations are usually an underestimate,
sometimes significantly so.

 FORCING GOOGLE TO SHARE SECRETS ISN'T COMPETITION (6 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Google has been mandated to share certain search index data and user
interaction information with competitors. While many are celebrating
this as a win, it could be a mistake. The decision means that Google
must now share its hard-earned knowledge with competitors who haven't
made the same investments or taken the same risks. These companies
should succeed by creating superior experiences, not by getting a free
ride on Google's research and development. Sharing this level of
behavioral data also creates new opportunities for misuse. A better
option would address specific anticompetitive behaviors while
preserving incentives for innovation. 

 WE ONLY HIRE THE TRENDIEST (23 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Programmers have their own form of elitism. The industry is not that
different from all the other industries that judge people based on
appearance. Instead of going after 'the best' programmers, hire
undistinguished workers and set them up for success. This is a lot
cheaper and can produce better results.
