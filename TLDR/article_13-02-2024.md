TLDR 2024-02-13

 WORKOS IS A MODERN IDENTITY PLATFORM FOR B2B SAAS (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Auth is crucial for B2B SaaS, but legacy vendors like Auth0 offer
opaque pricing, low usage caps, and insufficient enterprise
capabilities.
WorkOS [5] is changing the auth space. It provides flexible and
easy-to-use APIs for authentication, user identity, and complex
enterprise features like SSO and SCIM provisioning. And more
importantly, it's free up to 1 million monthly active users! [5]

Hundreds of high-growth scale-ups [5] are already powered by WorkOS
‚Äî including Vercel, Webflow, Plaid, and Loom.

If you want to provide a seamless experience from your first user, all
the way through to your largest enterprise customer, you should
definitely check out WorkOS [5].

 MICROSOFT PREPARES TO TAKE XBOX EVERYWHERE (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A number of Xbox exclusives are coming to the PS5 and Nintendo
Switch. The first two games set to appear on rival consoles are Hi-Fi
Rush and Pentiment, with Sea of Thieves set to launch later this year.
The move is a seismic shift in strategy - while it will give Microsoft
more reach, it comes with plenty of risks. Microsoft plans to continue
its Xbox hardware efforts, but its vision for the platform is unclear.


 HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE DOWNLOADING APPLE VISION PRO APPS? (11 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 More than 600 apps made for the Apple Vision Pro were available when
the device launched on February 2. Developers are complaining that
weak discovery and search functionalities in the App Store are
dampening the potential success of their apps. The top paid news app
receives over 300 installs a day, which is great for a headset that
just launched. Promoting apps on social media appears to give
transient success, but this might not be enough for consistent gains
over the long run.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SHINING LASER LIGHT ON GLASS CREATES A SOLAR CELL (3 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Glass made from tellurium behaves like a photovoltaic cell,
generating a current when a femtosecond laser light is fired at it.
This discovery opens up the possibility of windows that may double up
as energy-generating surfaces. The effect may possibly be seen in
other forms of glass - scientists have had no reason to explore how
femtosecond lasers affected different kinds of glass until now.
Tellurite glass has enhanced transparency in the mid-infrared region
and higher solubility for rare-earth ions, making it attractive for
optical fibers and optical amplifiers. 

 THE VR RACE IS BACK ON (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The VR market size is growing fast but still relatively small.
Retention is just OK - the technology is stickiest for use cases that
most people might not understand. There is real money to be made in
the space. One effective strategy seems to be using VR to create an
experience that creates a lot of buzz and then add cross-platform
capabilities, allowing apps to reach a much larger audience. The
competition between the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest platforms will
benefit developers and create more experimentation within the
ecosystem.

 CONDUCTOR (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Conductor is a platform for orchestrating microservices and events.
It supports a wide range of database persistence layers and queuing
services and has been battle-tested in production at Netflix.
Conductor provides powerful flow control constructs, client libraries
in multiple languages, and a distributed scalable architecture. It
features a bundled UI with an integrated interface to create, refine,
and validate workflows. It also has a full-featured API for custom
automations. 

 THE TOP OF THE DNS HIERARCHY (22 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Not all distributed systems are decentralized - many are not. One of
the easiest and most practical ways to organize a distributed system
is according to a hierarchy. The most prominent example of this is one
of the drivetrain mechanics of the internet: DNS. This article looks
at how DNS works. It covers how domains work, root servers, anycast,
attacks, and more. While DNS may seem simple, it relies on a great
deal of complexity within other parts of the system.

 ‚ÄúACCELERATIONISM‚Äù IS AN OVERDUE CORRECTIVE TO YEARS OF DOOM AND
GLOOM IN SILICON VALLEY (30 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 E/acc, or effective accelerationism, is a movement that is growing
within the tech hivemind. Its founders believe that the tech world has
become captive to a monoculture that is preventing it from producing
meaningful benefits. E/acc encourages more ideas, growth, competition,
and action. It is acting like a counterbalancing force to widespread
public concerns about the risks posed by the tech industry at large.
This article looks into the origins of e/acc and its impact on the
tech industry. 

 THE COMPOUNDING SEEDS OF CREATIVITY (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Creativity can't be saved for later - it has to be discharged
regularly or it will spoil. Being fully engaged at work is how you
best plant the seeds for your own adventures. Those who constantly use
up their creativity grow their intellectual granary many times over
than those who keep holding back. People who turn boring problems into
interesting pursuits always end up ahead in creativity and competence.
