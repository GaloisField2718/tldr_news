 WORKOS ACQUIRES WARRANT, THE FINE GRAINED AUTHORIZATION (FGA) SERVICE
FOR DEVELOPERS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 WorkOS is bolstering its vision to become the world's best identity
platform with the acquisition of Warrant - an open source
authorization service.

Fine grained authorization (FGA) [4] determines¬†_who has access to
what_¬†and¬†_what they can do_¬†within an app. At scale this becomes a
significant engineering lift due to the need to implement complicated,
permutation-heavy logic.¬†

Warrant's product is based on Zanzibar, the open source authorization
system originally designed by Google [4] to power Google Docs and
YouTube. This enables FAST AUTHORIZATION CHECKS AT ENORMOUS SCALE
while maintaining a¬†FLEXIBLE MODEL¬†that can be adapted to even the
most complex use cases.

 'IPHONE 17 SLIM' WITH SMALLER DISPLAY RUMORED TO LAUNCH NEXT YEAR (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is reportedly planning an 'iPhone 17 Slim' model to replace the
Plus model in its lineup. The Slim model will have around a 6.6-inch
display, a slimmer design, an A18 or A19 chip, 8GB of RAM, a
24-megapixel front camera, and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera. It is
expected to have an aluminum chassis and some other external design
changes. Apple will likely announce the iPhone 17 lineup in September
2025. 

 APPLE REPORTEDLY BUILDING M2 ULTRA AND M4-POWERED AI SERVERS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Foxconn is reportedly assembling Apple AI servers that contain the M2
Ultra. It is planning to assemble AI servers powered by the M4 chip in
late 2025. While Apple is prioritizing on-device processing for many
of its upcoming AI tools, some operations will inevitably have to
occur in the cloud. The company is expected to announce on-device AI
features at WWDC in June. 2025's iPhone 17 models will apparently be
more focused AI devices.

 HOW BOEING LOST THE SPACE RACE TO ELON MUSK'S SPACEX (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The US provided Boeing and SpaceX with funding to build a crewed
space vehicle in 2014. Boeing received far more funding than SpaceX
and it had far more experience, but the company still allocated fewer
resources to the project than it needed to thrive. The company kept
carrying technical debt forward so that additional work was lumped
onto the final milestones. Other issues, such as the way the company
was structured, cost fixation, siloed development, and a lack of
proper testing, all worked together to kneecap the project. 

 IN A HIGH-STAKES TEST, BOEING WILL LAUNCH NASA ASTRONAUTS TO SPACE
FOR THE FIRST TIME (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Boeing is set to launch two NASA astronauts to the International
Space Station (ISS) on its Starliner spacecraft. The inaugural crewed
flight is a crucial final test before NASA can authorize Boeing to
conduct routine flights to and from the space station for the agency.
This will be Boeing's first launch with humans aboard its spaceship.
The astronauts will spend about a week at the space station before
returning to Earth. While SpaceX has been ferrying astronauts to the
ISS since 2020, NASA does not want to rely on a single company.

 INTRODUCING ARTIFACT ATTESTATIONS ‚Äì NOW IN PUBLIC BETA (12 MINUTE

 GitHub's Artifact Attestations allows project maintainers to create a
tamper-proof, unforgeable paper trail linking their software to the
process that created it. It creates metadata that can be used as a
foundation for new security and validity checks through policy
evaluation. Verification support will be expanded to the Kubernetes
ecosystem later this year. 

 A USEFUL PRODUCTIVITY MEASURE? (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Software productivity is famously unmeasurable. This article suggests
using value-add capacity as a measure for software productivity. In
the absence of measures for return on investment, the percent of
engineering time spent on value-add activities is a pretty good proxy
for productivity. Using this metric can help organizations identify
what to focus on to achieve the goals they want.

 TENSIONS RISE IN SILICON VALLEY OVER SALES OF START-UP STOCKS (11
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Private stock sales have always felt a bit like the Wild West.
Investors continue to find ways around companies' attempts to restrict
stock sales using techniques such as forward contracts, which allow
employees to cash out their future shares through a pledge to sell the
shares to an investor in the future. Some companies forbid these
practices and say such deals are void. Companies creating funds with
these shares say they are making the market more accessible and that
shares obtained through forward contracts are legal. 

 TESLA ANNOUNCES FOURTH ROUND OF LAYOFFS IN FOUR WEEKS (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Multiple recently-former Tesla employees posted on social media on
Sunday to share that they were no longer with the company. The company
started laying off employees last month ahead of the release of its Q1
financial results. While Elon Musk has said that he plans to reduce
headcount by more than 10% globally, the total may be closer to 20% by
the time everything has settled. The latest round of layoffs affected
service advisers, engineers, and HR.
