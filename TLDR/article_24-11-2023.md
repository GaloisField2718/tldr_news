 SPACEX PLANS TO SELL SHARES NEXT MONTH AT $150B VALUATION ‚Äî SAME AS
SUMMER 2023 (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SpaceX is planning to sell shares next month in a deal that prices
them around the same level as summer 2023. The launch appears to
confirm that Elon Musk is not considering a near-term IPO for its
Starlink satellite division. It was reported earlier this month that
Musk was discussing a possible IPO for as early as late 2024, but he
has denied these reports. Starlink reported $1.4 billion in revenue
and a loss for the year in 2022, but it achieved breakeven cash flow
this year. 

 INSTAGRAM NOW ALLOWS ANYONE TO DOWNLOAD PUBLIC REELS (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Instagram now allows all users to download public Reels to their
devices. Users were previously only able to save them to the Instagram
app for later viewing. Downloaded Reels will have an Instagram
watermark with an account name, just like on TikTok. Reels that use
licensed audio clips will not have any audio in the downloaded clip.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE FIRST EMBRYOS FROM A MAMMAL HAVE NOW BEEN GROWN IN SPACE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A study on mouse embryos grown in space suggests that the radiation
and weightlessness of space might not pose immediate obstacles to
mammalian reproduction. While the study only isolates one part of the
complicated process of reproduction and development, it provides a
starting point for biologists. Future alterations to the procedure
could potentially increase the success rate. The absence of perfectly
sterile conditions in space probably affected the experiment results. 

 BACTERIA CAN STORE MEMORIES AND PASS THEM ON FOR GENERATIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists from the University of Texas and the University of
Delaware have discovered a memory system that allows E. coli to
remember past experiences for several hours and generations. The
scientists have yet to identify the molecular mechanism behind the
memory system or its inheritability, but there is strong evidence to
suggest that there is a level of persistent conditioning at play. It
is related to the level of intracellular iron in the bacteria. Iron is
connected to multiple stress responses in bacteria, so a memory system
that uses it makes a lot of evolutionary sense.

 DOES SIZE MATTER IN PULL REQUESTS: ANALYSIS ON 30K DEVELOPERS (10
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A short pull request might not offer a comprehensive view of the
changes, but an excessively large PR can overwhelm viewers and make it
challenging to identify issues or provide meaningful feedback. This
article analyzes the PRs of around 30,000 developers to see how the
size of PRs correlates with lead time, comments received, and change
failure to try to find what statistically is the best size and examine
what affects it. It will look at the stats from various angles to see
how this correlation varies by company, developers, and other factors.


 EVERY SOFTWARE IS MESSY AND HAS SKELETONS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Every software giant has some skeletons in their development closets.
Projects may start with the best intentions, but harsh realities make
it challenging to maintain the original vision of a project. Large
releases are less about achieving perfection and more about managing
controlled chaos. The IT world is messy and every product, no matter
how successful, has its hidden weaknesses. The key to a successful
product is not the absence of problems, but the ability to handle them
efficiently.
