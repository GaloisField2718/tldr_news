 NVIDIA DETAILS NEW AI CHIPS AND AUTONOMOUS CAR PROJECT WITH MERCEDES
(7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nvidia plans to start shipping its Vera Rubin AI chip later this
year. The chip, designed to fulfill AI requests more quickly and
cheaply than its predecessors, has been in development for three
years. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, discussed the company's
surprisingly ambitious work around autonomous vehicles during CES
2026. Mercedes-Benz plans to start shipping cars equipped with Nvidia
self-driving technology this year.

 WHEN AWS GREW WINGS: THE “BORING” GENIUS OF AMAZON LEO (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Amazon Leo, formerly known as Project Kuiper, will launch in the
first quarter of this year with a three-tier hardware strategy that
will first target the US, UK, Germany, France, and Canada. Customers
will be able to choose between three terminals: Leo Nano, which is
capable of delivering 100 Mbps; Leo Pro, a standard unit that can push
400 Mbps; and Leo Ultra, an enterprise terminal capable of 1 Gbps. The
smaller terminals will help the service scale, while the Ultra
terminal signals to traditional broadband providers that Amazon plans
to support them rather than bypass them. 

 FINGER-PRICK BLOOD TEST COULD OFFER EASIER WAY TO DETECT ALZHEIMER'S,
RESEARCHERS SAY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dried blood analysis could be a feasible and scalable way to detect
the brain changes linked to Alzheimer's. Researchers have developed a
dried blood test that, while less accurate than traditional blood
tests, showed good ability to distinguish people with
Alzheimer's-related disease. The method is cheaper than traditional
testing and could potentially be performed outside of clinical
settings. The same technique could potentially be used to detect other
conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis.

 THE NEXT TWO YEARS OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Change is the only constant. Keep a finger on technology trends to
avoid being caught off-guard by hype or doom. Update skills, diversify
abilities, and focus on uniquely human aspects to stay in the loop.
There will always be demand for engineers who think holistically,
learn continuously, and drive technology toward solving real problems.


 THE IMPORTANCE OF AGENT HARNESS IN 2026 (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 An Agent Harness is the infrastructure that wraps around an AI model
to manage long-running tasks. It is the system that governs how the
agent operates. Agent harnesses turn vague, multistep agent workflows
into structured data that can be logged and graded to improve systems.
They can be used to validate real-world progress, empower the user
experience, and improve models via real-world feedback.

 MY 2026 AI BETS (A TIME CAPSULE) (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This year, multi-step, tool-using, self-correcting loops will become
the default way of working. The gap between those who use AI
effectively and those who do not will become more obvious.
Organizations will become more streamlined and deal with different
risk models. Consultancies that help businesses become 'AI-native'
will clean up. 

 AMAZON ALEXA+ RELEASED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC VIA AN EARLY ACCESS
WEBSITE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Alexa+ is now available to everyone through a free early access
program. The AI is now accessible as a chatbot on a website, similar
to other AI products. Alexa+ will be included with Amazon Prime
memberships, which start at $15 per month, or cost $20 per month as a
standalone subscription. While still in early access, reports say that
Alexa+ is slower than expected and struggles with inaccuracies at
times.
