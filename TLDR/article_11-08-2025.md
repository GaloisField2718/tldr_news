 ALEXA GOT AN A.I. BRAIN TRANSPLANT. HOW SMART IS IT NOW? (10 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Alexa+ is a remodel of Alexa that aims to marry the conversational
skills of generative AI chatbots with the daily tasks the old Alexa
did well. It is now being rolled out widely after being in a testing
program for a few months. While the new Alexa is more fun to talk to
and has some new capabilities, it is still too buggy and unreliable.
It lags behind voice models that other companies provide, and it is
noticeably worse than the original Alexa at some basic tasks. 

 TESLA ROBOTAXI SCORES PERMIT TO RUN RIDE-HAILING SERVICE IN TEXAS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla has obtained a permit to run a ride-hailing business in Texas.
Elon Musk said on Tesla's earnings call last month that he believes
Tesla could serve half the US population by the end of the year with
autonomous ride-hailing services. Tesla's autonomous vehicle efforts
have faced a number of challenges across the country, including
federal probes, product liability lawsuits, and recalls following
injurious or damaging collisions. The company currently lags way
behind competitors in the robotaxi market, like Alphabet's Waymo in
the US and Baidu's Apollo Go in China.

 DIABETIC MAN WITH GENE-EDITED CELLS PRODUCES HIS OWN INSULIN—NO
TRANSPLANT DRUGS REQUIRED (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scientists in Sweden and the US have helped a 42-year-old man with
long-standing diabetes make his own insulin using gene-edited
pancreatic cells. The patient was given donated islet cells that were
genetically modified using CRISPR to prevent immune rejection. Donated
islet cell transplants seem to be able to provide a self-sustained
replacement supply of insulin for type 1 diabetics, but these
transplants require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to ensure the
host's body doesn't attack the donated cells. The study, while
preliminary, suggests that it is possible to avoid provoking an immune
response. 

 BUTTER MADE FROM CARBON TASTES LIKE THE REAL THING, GETS BACKING FROM
BILL GATES (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Savor, a company in Batavia, Illinois, makes butter from carbon and
hydrogen with no agriculture whatsoever. The butter looks, smells, and
tastes like real butter but without the farmland, fertilizer, or
emissions tied to the typical process. The company expects its
products to be available on shelves for the average consumer by around
2027. Savor is backed by billionaire Bill Gates, who says lab-made
fats and oils have an immense potential to significantly reduce
humans' carbon footprint.
