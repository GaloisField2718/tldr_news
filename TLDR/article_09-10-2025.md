 HOW ULTRASOUND IS USHERING A NEW ERA OF SURGERY-FREE CANCER TREATMENT
(14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Histotripsy is a cancer treatment in which ultrasound waves are
concentrated onto a small area of a tumor to destroy it. The
ultrasound is delivered in quick bursts, creating tiny microbubbles
that expand and then collapse in milliseconds, breaking apart the
tumor tissue as they do. The patient's immune system then cleans up
the remains. The treatment is fast, non-toxic, and non-invasive.
Patients receiving it can usually go home on the same day, with most
procedures over in one to three hours. Histotripsy has been approved
by the US FDA for the treatment of liver tumors.
