 SPACEX POLARIS DAWN CREW RETURNS HOME AFTER HISTORY-MAKING MISSION (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission has returned to Earth, splashing down
in the Gulf of Mexico early Sunday morning. The four astronauts made
history as the mission reached a higher altitude than any human has
traveled in five decades and also included the first spacewalk
completed by a privately funded and operated mission. This was the
third trip to space for the specific Crew Dragon capsule used in the
mission. Besides the spacewalk, the crew carried out nearly 40 science
experiments and research. 

 TIKTOK IS ABOUT TO GET ITS DAY IN COURT (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 On September 16, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
will hear oral arguments for TikTok's First Amendment challenge to
legislation that it claims amounts to a ban. The US government argues
that TikTok is a clear national security threat but says that
revealing why would be a threat. Its claims rely on dozens of pages of
redacted classified material that likely focus on the potential that
the Chinese government could compel ByteDance to hand over the data of
US users or push specific content onto US users. These risks are
reportedly so significant that they override TikTok's First Amendment
claims.

 AN INJECTABLE HIV-PREVENTION DRUG IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ‚Äî BUT WILDLY
EXPENSIVE (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The results from a landmark pair of major clinical trials of
lenacapavir, an injectable HIV-prevention drug that only requires
dosing every six months, show that it is 89% more effective at
preventing HIV than daily oral preventative medication among gay,
bisexual, and transgender people. It could be a game changer if rolled
out broadly and equitably, but the drug is extraordinarily expensive.
Its current list price for use as an HIV treatment is $3,450 per
month. It is unclear whether it will have a different list price for
use as a preventive. 

 NASA CONFIRMS IT'S DEVELOPING THE MOON'S NEW TIME ZONE (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 NASA is developing a new lunar time system for the Moon. Time changes
relative to speed and gravity - it moves slightly faster on the Moon
because of its weaker gravity. The small difference in time could have
large effects on calculations made in space. The project aims to be
scalable to other celestial bodies in the future. NASA is aiming to
have the standard ready by 2026.

 OPENAI IS REPORTEDLY MOVING AWAY FROM ITS COMPLICATED NON-PROFIT
STRUCTURE NEXT YEAR (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Sam Altman told OpenAI staff members during their weekly staff
meeting that the company will be transitioning to a more traditional
for-profit corporate structure next year. OpenAI will remain focused
on building AI that benefits everyone. Altman did not specify exactly
what the company's corporate structure will look like, but a
spokesperson says that non-profit is core to OpenAI's mission and will
continue to exist. The company started as a non-profit organization
that relied on money from donors, but donations alone were not enough
for the cost of computation power and talent required to push its core
research forward.
