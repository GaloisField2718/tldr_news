 APPLE NEARS $1 BILLION-A-YEAR-DEAL TO USE GOOGLE AI FOR SIRI (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple plans to pay Google $1 billion a year for a 1.2
trillion-parameter AI model to help run its Siri voice assistant. The
model will run on Apple's own Private Cloud Compute servers, ensuring
that user data remains secure. The companies are still finalizing the
agreement, which will be an interim solution until Apple's models are
powerful enough. The new Siri is on track to launch in Spring. 

 BLUE ORIGIN'S BIG BOY IS BACK: 3 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT NEW GLENN'S
SECOND LAUNCH (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Blue Origin is getting ready for the second launch of New Glenn,
which is scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, no
earlier than 2:51 PM ET on Sunday. The heavy-lift launch vehicle is
now in the final stages of preparation for the flight. The mission
will include another boost recovery attempt and the launch of NASA's
ESCAPADE mission. The success of the launch will determine whether New
Glenn could become a viable option for critical NASA science missions
and national security contracts.

 THE NEXT BIG QUANTUM COMPUTER HAS ARRIVED (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Quantinuum's Helios machine contains 98 physical qubits, and from
those, it can deliver 48 logical error-corrected qubits. The 2:1 ratio
is unique - other machines require anything from dozens to hundreds of
physical qubits to create one logical qubit. Quantinuum expects to
create a large-scale fault-tolerant machine by 2029 with its upcoming
Apollo machine, which will have thousands of physical qubits and
hundreds of logical ones. Its customers include JPMorgan Chase, which
has been using Helios in private preview to run complex algorithms. 

 THIS MACHINE COULD KEEP A BABY ALIVE OUTSIDE THE WOMB. HOW WILL THE
WORLD DECIDE TO USE IT? (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 More than 10,000 infants in the US are born prematurely each year.
Premature birth remains the nation's second-leading cause of infant
death, and those who survive it may face crippling lifelong
complications. Artificial wombs promise to save more babies, but the
technology raises ethical questions that need to be answered before
human trials begin. If perfected, the technology could rewrite the
limits of viability.

 A SHORT SURVEY OF COMPILER TARGETS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There are currently many mature options for compiler targets. This
post presents a short survey of some of the popular and interesting
options. Compiler targets can include machine code, other high-level
languages, virtual machines, and more. Some compiler developers pick
unconventional targets for academic curiosity, artistic expression, or
to test the boundaries of viable compilation targets.

 AMAZON UPHEAVAL: WITH MORALE SHAKEN, JASSY LOOKS FOR NEXT BIG PLAY
AFTER MASS LAYOFFS (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Andy Jassy recently laid out a vision for how he wants Amazon to
operate like the world's largest startup. The company has been working
hard to flatten its organization, getting rid of bureaucracy in order
to move faster and stay competitive. Amazon announced last week it
would lay off about 14,000 corporate employees and said more cuts are
expected soon. The next big wave of cuts is expected to start in
January. Jassy has been searching for Amazon's next opportunity - the
company has made big bets on satellite internet, health care, grocery,
entertainment, and self-driving vehicles. 

 GOOGLE SETTLEMENT WITH EPIC CAPS PLAY STORE FEES, BOOSTS OTHER
ANDROID APP STORES (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google and Epic have reached a settlement that will provide a
framework for long-term global changes to Android app distribution. It
still needs to be approved by a judge, but the changes could be put
into practice by late this year. Third-party app stores will get a
boost, developers will enjoy lower fees, and Google won't drag out the
process for years. The agreement isn't intended to undo the jury
verdict or sidestep the court's previous order, but is aimed instead
at reinforcing the court's intent while eliminating potential delays
in realigning the app market.
