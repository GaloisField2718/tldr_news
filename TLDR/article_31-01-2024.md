 CHATGPT USERS CAN NOW INVOKE GPTS DIRECTLY IN CHATS (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Paid ChatGPT users can now bring third-party apps powered by OpenAI's
AI models into a conversation by typing '@' and selecting a GPT from
the list. The selected GPT will have a full understanding of the
conversation. Different GPTs can be tagged for different use cases and
needs. OpenAI plans to eventually introduce monetization for GPTs, but
the company may have to get traffic up first. Moderation of GPTs is
proving to be a challenge to OpenAI. 

 APPLE VISION PRO REVIEW: MAGIC, UNTIL IT‚ÄôS NOT (45 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Apple's Vision Pro marketing shows people using the device all the
time: at work, while doing laundry, and even when playing with the
kids. The device aims to layer apps and information over the real
world, augmenting reality. While the device is amazing at times, it
contains a series of large tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore.
The device can be heavy on users' faces, messes up users' hair, and is
more cumbersome to carry around than a laptop. After several days of
use, this reviewer questions whether these tradeoffs are worth it.

 RESEARCHERS APPROACH NEW SPEED LIMIT FOR SEMINAL PROBLEM (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The traveling salesperson problem asks for the ideal route through a
list of locations, minimizing mileage. It is notoriously difficult,
but a mathematical model called linear programming is able to
approximate the problem as a set of equations and find the best
solution. Integer linear programming (ILP) is a variant of linear
programming that optimizes for problems solving whole-number amounts.
A researcher from the University of Washington has combined geometric
tools to create a new, faster algorithm for solving ILP in almost the
same time as a trivial binary case. It is the first major improvement
to ILP solvers in nearly 40 years. 

 WHY FARCASTER FRAMES ARE IMPORTANT (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Facebook's somewhat-forgotten Open Graph Protocol has been
resurrected to power Frames inside Farcaster. Farcaster is a social
network protocol built on the blockchain. Frames provide an easy way
to run apps while users are still inside other apps. They make it
possible to have a real and universal graph of user actions across
consumer apps.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 FOUNDATIONS (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Foundations is a modular Rust library designed to help scale programs
for distributed production-grade systems. It features logging,
distributed tracing, metrics, memory profiling, service configuration
with documentation, and a CLI helper that takes care of configuration
loading. Foundations enables engineers to concentrate on core business
logic rather than the intricacies of production operation setups. 

 PROTON (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Proton is a streaming SQL engine powered by ClickHouse. It can help
developers solve streaming data processing and routing and analytics
challenges and send aggregated data to downstream systems. Proton is
fast, lightweight, and the best streaming SQL engine for Kafka or
Redpanda. A demo video is available.

 READING THE FINE PRINT OF APPLE‚ÄôS DMA RULES: 25 THINGS APP
DEVELOPERS NEED TO KNOW (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The EU's Digital Markets Act requires Apple to make changes to
increase competition in the app industry. Several large companies have
come out against Apple's changes, which seem to be designed to ensure
Apple's ability to profit from apps continues regardless of how
they're discovered and installed. This article covers details about
Apple's new rules that developers should know. The article will be
updated as more is uncovered from within Apple's documents. 

 SHOULD 4 PEOPLE BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE EQUIVALENT OF A NUKE? (9
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Artificial General Intelligence will be an evolution of AI that can
understand, learn, and apply intelligence to a wide range of problems.
It will enable solutions to complex global issues, but also
potentially lead to consequences as impactful and irreversible as
those of nuclear war. While this is something the OpenAI board takes
very seriously, the events in late November, which resulted in the
previous six-person board of directors dropping down to one holdover
member and two new people, are troubling. It is still unknown why the
board did what they did. This article looks at the impacts of the
November event and AI governance in general.
