 OPENAI IS PAYING EMPLOYEES MORE THAN ANY MAJOR TECH STARTUP IN
HISTORY (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI's average stock-based compensation for its roughly 4,000
employees is about $1.5 million per employee. The company's equity
awards, aimed at helping it keep its lead in the AI race, are
inflating its heavy operating losses and diluting existing
shareholders. OpenAI recently announced the discontinuation of a
policy that required employees to work at the company for at least six
months before their equity vests. This could lead to further
compensation increases.

 MEET A US START-UP TRYING TO BREAK CHINA'S RARE-EARTH MONOPOLY (10
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There is too little money to be made in rare earth to be of much
interest to mining giants, so the challenge of reestablishing a
domestic industry in the US has fallen to small companies. Metal
prices have risen in recent months as China has restricted exports in
response to US tariffs. It will be difficult for local startups to
compete as China's grip on the industry is tight, and it is known to
sell rare-earth metals for less than it costs to produce them. The
biggest question is whether the US government will continue to
subsidize the domestic industry, and at what level.

 THE EFFICIENCY PARADOX: WHY MAKING SOFTWARE EASIER TO WRITE MEANS
WE'LL WRITE EXPONENTIALLY MORE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Efficiency improvements reveal latent demand that was previously
uneconomic to address. The pattern is consistent throughout history.
We are about to see an increase in knowledge work output of several
orders of magnitude. This will likely reveal that humanity has been
massively under-investing in knowledge work because it was too
expensive. 

 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IN 2026 (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The primary impact of AI tooling so far is that the marginal cost of
producing code has gone down significantly. However, producing code is
only part of the job, so the bottlenecks for engineering time will
shift elsewhere. The software engineering field seems poised to be
more mechanized, but more productive as a result. Most of the effects
of the mindset shift that has been accelerating for the last few
months have yet to be fully realized.

 2025 LETTER (72 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Progress is a smooth trend that obscures jagged details. History is a
record of thousands of years of stasis before hundreds of years of
growth. There hasn't been any constant normal trend ever, so no one
should expect AI to be the same. Nothing is truly inevitable, but it
would be strange if progress stopped tomorrow.
