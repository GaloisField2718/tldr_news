liquidate their shares in the company. OpenAI was valued at
approximately $29 billion early last year.

READ) [6] 

 Reddit has signed a deal with an unnamed large AI company for access
to its user-generated content platform. The deal is worth about $60
million annually. It is still subject to change as Reddit's plans to
go public are still in the works. Companies like OpenAI and Apple are
also seeking to make deals with other platforms to use their data to
train AI models.

 NEW FDA-APPROVED DRUG MAKES SEVERE FOOD ALLERGIES LESS
LIFE-THREATENING (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The FDA has approved an antibody drug called omalizumab (brand name
Xolair) as an injection to lessen allergic reactions to foods in
people ages 1 and up. The drug works by binding to a class of
antibodies called immunoglobulin E, preventing them from triggering an
allergic response. It doesn't eliminate food allergies, but it will
help reduce the health impact if accidental exposure occurs. The
drug's effects are not universal - in studies, around 17% of the
people receiving the drug showed no significant improvement in their
sensitivity to allergy-triggering food. 

 SOFTBANK FOUNDER REPORTEDLY AIMS TO RAISE $100 BILLION TO BUILD AI
CHIP COMPANY THAT WOULD RIVAL NVIDIA ‚Äî PROJECT IZANAGI MIGHT
LEVERAGE ARM DESIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Project Izanagi is a new chip venture from Softbank's founder that
aims to compete with Nvidia in the artificial intelligence processor
space. The project seeks to complement Softbank's Arm Holdings, which
designs processor architectures. It is unclear whether the AI
processors designed by Project Izanagi will rely on technologies
developed by Arm. The project may affect Arm's plans to create
reference chip designs for various workloads. It is separate from any
collaboration with OpenAI.

Keras model that only weighs around 1MB to enable precise file
identification within milliseconds when running on a single CPU.

security and content policy scanners. 

 PWAS WON'T REPLACE NATIVE IOS APPS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Supporting progressive web apps (PWAs) on iOS takes a lot of time and
effort. While there is support for push notifications, there are a lot
of missing features and other issues. This article discusses issues
and bugs discovered when developing a PWA for iOS. Companies building
PWAs on iOS should not expect them to come close to a native
experience. Apple's choice to restrict PWA use in Europe is
concerning.

manufacturer when it showed off its first model in 2007. It passed
Tesla in worldwide sales last year and is currently building assembly

at the company, how it started, and its journey to where it is now. 

 INTERVIEW: FIGMA‚ÄôS CEO ON LIFE AFTER THE COMPANY‚ÄôS FAILED SALE TO
ADOBE (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Figma's CEO Dylan Field offered employees severance if they wanted to
leave the company after its blockbuster sale to Adobe was blocked by
regulators. 4% of employees took him up on the offer. While Figma
appears to be in a stronger position than when it first agreed to sell
to Adobe in 2022, Field also lowered the company's internal valuation
to $10 billion - the same number it was in 2021. Field wants to use
Adobe's $1 billion breakup fee to look at new areas for Figma to
expand to.
