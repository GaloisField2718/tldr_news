 WHY ARE WE SURPRISED THAT STARTUPS ARE SO FREAKING HARD? (10 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang recently said that if he could be 30 again,
he wouldn't start a company as the work he put into Nvidia wasn't
worth it. This article explores Huang's statement from a founder's
perspective with a focus on figuring out why it's such a surprise to
people that building a startup would be hard. No matter how successful
a company is, nearly every founder says that the work was much harder
than they thought it would be. This doesn't happen in fields like
sports, where athletes work hard for decades but they are never
surprised about how hard it was.
