 LAST CHANCE TO JOIN BIG INVESTORS ON THIS “UNLISTED” STOCK
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 When the former Zillow exec who sold his first company for $120m
starts a new venture, people notice. _Thousands_ of people. In fact,
12,000+ regular investors have already joined the early investors
behind Uber, eBay, and Venmo as Pacaso shareholders.

Disrupting the real estate industry once again, Pacaso's tech offers
co-ownership of premier properties, revamping a $1.3T market.

And it works. By handing keys to 2,000+ homeowners, Pacaso has already
made $110m+ in gross profits to date. [4] They even reserved the
Nasdaq ticker PCSO.

You can join, too. But only until midnight. Invest before the
opportunity ends. [4]

ticker symbol is not a guarantee that the company will go public.

 CHINESE OFFICIALS URGE FIRMS TO SHUN NVIDIA AI CHIP (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 China's top cybersecurity regulator has urged big tech companies not
to buy Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000 chip, a less-advanced AI chip that the US
has allowed Nvidia to sell to Chinese customers. Domestic firms have
been encouraged to switch to homegrown hardware. Some Chinese
officials view the country's chips as strong alternatives to those
Nvidia is allowed to sell in China. China has had trouble ramping up
production of its best chips in part because its access to
leading-edge components and chip-making equipment has been blocked by
the US.

 AXIOM SPACE AIMS FOR ORBIT WITH ITS ORBITAL DATA CENTER NODE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Axiom Space plans to launch two Axiom Orbital Data Center (AxODC)
Nodes by the end of 2025, with at least three running by the end of
2027. The nodes will increase computing capacity on the International
Space Station. Even if Axiom manages to get the hardware installed in
the ISS in the next few years, the complex is due for deorbit by 2030.
The company last year published optimistic plans to make its own space
station by 2028. 

 AI-DESIGNED PHAGES (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Arc Institute and Stanford University researchers have created the
first viable genomes using generative AI. They created 16
bacteriophages using fine-tuned versions of both Evo 1 and Evo 2,
models freely available on Hugging Face. Their work offers a blueprint
for the design of diverse synthetic bacteriophages and lays a
foundation for the generative design of useful living systems at the
genome scale. The research may present some risks, but at the moment,
using AI to make synthetic genomes costs a great deal at both the
design and construction stages and isn't viable for most companies.

 SMBS DON'T NEED AN IT STACK (SPONSOR) [9] 

 5+ separate tools for IT and security management is way too many.
Electric [9] consolidates everything - device management, security
policies, employee onboarding -into one platform built specifically
for smaller teams. Automated remediation, built-in integrations with
your HR tools, and no technical expertise required. Take a demo and
get a YETI cooler or Apple AirPods Pros [9] 

 UUIDV47 (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 UUIDv47 lets users store sortable UUIDv7 in their databases while
emitting a UUIDv4-looking facade at the API boundary. UUIDv7 is
time-ordered and is better for index locality and pagination. The
facade is indistinguishable from v4, providing security. 

 BORING IS GOOD (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Most companies that have tried to implement AI technology have yet to
see a positive outcome. Large language models are not intelligent, and
they will never be. They aren't good at doing 'intelligent things' and
replacing human tasks is far more complex than originally thought.
There may be other potential uses for this technology, but the current
approach is failing, and something has to change.

 AN INTERVIEW WITH YOUTUBE CEO NEAL MOHAN ABOUT BUILDING A STAGE FOR
CREATORS (57 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 YouTube CEO Neal Mohan joined Google as part of the DoubleClick
acquisition in 2007. He moved to YouTube in 2015 to become Chief
Product Officer and succeeded Susan Woycicki as CEO in 2023. This
interview with Mohan discusses his background, how YouTube wants to
use AI to enhance creators, YouTube monetization, the difference
between a platform and creators, and the company's attempted takeover
of the living room TV. The interview is also available as a podcast. 

 INSIDE THE APPLE AUDIO LAB WHERE AIRPODS ARE TESTED AND TUNED (8
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple uses a collection of audio metric booths to help correct and
calibrate the AirPods' fit for natural variations in ear geometry. Its
engineers use devices seen in audiologists' offices to help validate
the company's claims of a clinical-grade hearing test. This allows
AirPods users to set up their devices as a hearing aid at home and
also creates an accurate hearing profile so users can hear music the
way it was intended. This article takes a look at the labs where Apple
tests and tunes its AirPods, which show how important sound is to
everything Apple builds.
