 TESLA BEGINS ‘FSD SUPERVISED' RIDE-HAIL TESTS WITH EMPLOYEES IN
AUSTIN, BAY AREA (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla is now testing its autonomous ride-hailing service with
employees in the Austin and San Francisco Bay Area. The company has
completed over 1,500 trips and 15,000 miles of driving. The robotaxi
service will launch in Austin in June with 10 to 20 vehicles set to
launch on day one. It will use Tesla's existing portfolio of vehicles
rather than the Cybercab concept the company debuted last year.
Autonomous vehicle companies in California need a range of permits to
operate - Tesla so far only has a permit to test autonomously with a
safe driver. 

 GOOGLE REVEALS SKY-HIGH GEMINI USAGE NUMBERS IN ANTITRUST CASE (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google Gemini reached 350 million monthly active users as of March
2025, with a daily traffic of 35 million users. The number of users
has increased significantly since late last year, when the service had
tens of millions of users and 9 million daily active users. Despite
the uptick in usage, Google is still far from catching up with OpenAI.
The company is likely losing money on each user - OpenAI has
previously noted that it loses money even on its $200 monthly plan.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SCIENTISTS SAY THEY FOUND A NEW COLOR HUMANS HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have figured out a way to artificially expand the natural
human color gamut. Humans usually have three different types of cone
cells that combine their signals to form the normal color spectrum.
The 'green' cones' function overlaps completely with the 'red' and
'blue' cones, meaning there's no wavelength of light that stimulates
only the 'green' cones under natural conditions. Shooting a green
laser at only the 'green' cones creates a color that the brain is
unfamiliar with - the researchers have named the new color 'olo'. 

 AI OUTSMARTS VIRUS EXPERTS IN THE LAB, RAISING BIOHAZARD FEARS (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new study conducted by researchers at the Center for AI Safety,
MIT's Medicine Lab, Brazilian university UFABC, and SecureBio claims
that AI models can now outperform PhD-level virologists in
problem-solving in wet labs, where scientists analyze chemicals and
biological material. In the study, virologists scored an average of
22.1% in their declared area of expertise while OpenAI's o3 reached
43.8% accuracy and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro scored 37.6%. The results
are concerning to some scientists as for the first time in history,
virtually anyone has access to a non-judgmental virology expert that
could walk them through complex lab processes to create bioweapons.

 YAGRI: YOU ARE GONNA READ IT (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 You shouldn't just store the minimum data required to satisfy the
current product spec, you should also store data that you'll highly
likely use, such as timestamps and contextual metadata. For example,
instead of just deleting rows from a database, engineers should
instead store data on who deleted it, how they deleted it, when, and
why. While not every bit of data stored will end up serving a purpose,
the extra data could end up saving you one day, which makes up for the
cost of storing it. While you shouldn't log just everything, people
rarely complain about a table having too many timestamps. 

 OPENAI MAKES ITS UPGRADED IMAGE GENERATOR AVAILABLE TO DEVELOPERS (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's new and improved image generation feature is now available
on its API. Developers are able to generate multiple images at a time,
control generation quality/speed, and adjust moderation sensitivity.
All images will be watermarked with C2PA metadata so they can be
identified as AI-generated by supported platforms and apps. It costs
around 2 cents to generate a low-quality square image and 19 cents for
a high-quality square image.

 10 THINGS I LEARNED FROM 10 YEARS AT FIGMA (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Claire Butler joined Figma in 2015 as the first marketer and business
hire. Since then, the company has grown from nine people coding
quietly in a small office attached to a rental its CEO shared with its
co-founder to 1,400 employees and millions of users. Butler just left
the company - this post contains a succinct list of lessons that
Butler learned over the decade. 

 YOUTUBE TURNS 20 AND IS ON TRACK TO BE THE BIGGEST MEDIA COMPANY BY
REVENUE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Twenty years ago, Jawed Karim uploaded a 19-second clip to his new
platform YouTube, sparking a new era in online video. Founded by
Karim, Steve Chen, and Chad Hurley, the service was sold to Google in
2006 for $1.65 billion. It has since evolved into a global media
juggernaut worth up to $550 billion. YouTube is set to become the
biggest media company by revenue this year. A key challenge for
YouTube will be the possible remedies the Department of Justice will
seek in Google's antitrust case.
