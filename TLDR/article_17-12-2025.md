 OPENAI'S CHATGPT UPDATED TO MAKE IMAGES BETTER AND FASTER (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The new version of ChatGPT Image is designed to make and edit images
more precisely. It can generate pictures up to four times faster than
the previous image-generation model. OpenAI is creating a new section
within ChatGPT specifically for making images. The company is aiming
to cater to a mix of personal and professional uses. 

 WARNER BROS. PLANS TO REJECT PARAMOUNT BID ON FUNDING, TERMS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Warner Bros. plans to reject Paramount's hostile takeover bid due to
concerns about financing and other terms. The board will urge
shareholders to reject the tender offer. It views the company's
existing agreement with Netflix as offering greater value, certainty,
and terms than what Paramount has proposed. While Warner Bros.'
agreement with Netflix bars it from soliciting proposals from other
bidders, it is allowed to entertain incoming proposals.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 IF AI COULD INTERACT AND LEARN FROM THE PHYSICAL WORLD, COULD IT MAKE
MORE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES? (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI partnered with Red Queen Bio to introduce a new evolutionary
framework that uses GPT-5 to optimize cloning protocols. The project
involved the pilot of an autonomous robot to carry out the protocols.
GPT-achieved a 79x cloning efficiency gain and introduced a new
enzyme-based approach. While this is not a bio breakthrough, the novel
optimization shows that GPT-5 is at the level of a competent PhD
student at this task. 

 SAWING A DAM IN HALF (ON PURPOSE) (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Fontana Dam started showing cracks in 1972, caused by concrete
expansion. Engineers decided to give the concrete more room to grow
rather than patching cracks as they appeared. They cut a relief slot
all through the dam without draining the reservoir or causing any
disruptions to the hydropower plant. This post explains how this was
achieved. A video showing footage of the procedure is available.

 ON THE SUCCESS OF ‘NATURAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING' (7 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Machines can now be programmed in our native tongues. This year, the
industry has made significant progress on how to use AI agents and is
seeing significant returns from that effort. There's still more work
to learn how to use them efficiently, but there's no doubt that the
technology is the future of programming. This will bring the power of
computing to more places, more people, and more problems. 

 FACILITATING AI ADOPTION AT IMPRINT (20 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Working on internal AI adoption is a thing every engineering leader
will need to do. This post details how Imprint approached the problem,
detailing the lessons learned during the process. It is still early
for AI adoption, so focusing on the rate of learning is more valuable
than anything else. Engineers leading the internal AI initiative must
also be using the tools they are introducing.

 INSTAGRAM REELS IS COMING TO A TV NEAR YOU (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Meta has unveiled a dedicated Instagram Reels TV app. The app will
debut on Amazon's Fire TV before expanding to other platforms. It will
allow users to watch Instagram Reels' short-form, user-generated
videos on bigger screens. Social video is increasingly capturing
big-screen attention, with platforms like YouTube gaining more watch
time on TV than anything else. 

 MESSAGING IS A MOAT, NOT A BUSINESS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Messaging platforms command astronomical acquisition prices, but they
often flounder when left to stand alone in the public markets.
Messaging is perhaps the most valuable loss leader in digital history.
It creates massive utility, commands unparalleled user attention, and
offers high retention, but captures almost no direct financial value
of its own.
