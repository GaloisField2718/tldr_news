 DEEPSEEK: THE QUIET GIANT LEADING CHINA'S AI RACE (32 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Deepseek's latest R1 model beat OpenAI's o1 on multiple reasoning
benchmarks. The Chinese AI lab is fully funded and has no plans to
fundraise. It is focused on building foundational technology rather
than commercial applications and has committed to open-sourcing all of
its models. This article contains an in-depth interview with
Deepseek's CEO Liang Wenfeng, which covers Deepseek's ambitions for
AGI, why the AI Lab views open source as the dominant strategy, how
Deepseek hires and organizes researchers, why Chinese firms settle for
copying and commercialization instead of 'hardcore innovation', and
how Deepseek plans to ignite more 'hardcore innovation' across the
Chinese economy.

 CHINA TO PLANT 'FLAPPING' FLAG ON MOON: A LUNAR FIRST (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 China plans to place a free-standing flag designed to 'flap' on the
airless surface of the Moon. The flag will have closed-loop wires
embedding into its fabric - it will 'flap' using magnetic currents and
electromagnetic interactions to create a waving motion. The flag will
be installed in late 2026 when Chang'e 7 heads to the Moon. Chang'e 7,
destined to land near the edge of Shackleton Crater in the Moon's
south polar region, is designed to carry out some serious science -
the area it is landing in is suspected to contain water ice.

 LAWYER EXPLAINS WHY APPLE CAN'T BRING TIKTOK BACK TO THE APP STORE
YET (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Apple has removed TikTok from its App Store because of the company's
obligation to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates.
While President Trump has assured that the law banning TikTok would
not be enforced, some experts say the promise offers minimal security.
Trump could change his mind at any time or selectively enforce against
companies that fall from political favor. Future administrations would
almost certainly be free to pursue violations. The financial
consequences of non-enforcement could be severe, even for a company of
Apple's stature.
