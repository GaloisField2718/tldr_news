 THIS AI IS MAKING MARKETING MORE HUMAN. ADOBE AND HASBRO ARE ON BOARD
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 For too long, marketing has been about creating messages that people
don't want to hear, delivered via interruption. RAD Intel [4] is an
AI-driven disrupter putting the human touch back in marketing, and
generating huge amounts of investment [4] in the process.

The company's patented AI persona generator reveals exactly who a
company's customer is – down to the topics, interests, and triggers
that drive action – before pinpointing the perfect (human)
personality to deliver the message.

 HOW ELON MUSK RESCUED X FROM THE BRINK (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Late last month, Elon Musk announced that he was merging X with xAI
in a deal that valued the newly combined company at more than $100
billion. This article reveals the string of events that helped Musk
announce the deal before Trump's tariffs effectively closed the market
for deals. The deal moves Musk closer to his longtime goal of turning
X into an 'everything app'. The combined company will initially focus
on more tightly embedding xAI's Grok chatbot into X, making it more
central to the app experience. 

 HOW TRUMP'S TIKTOK NEGOTIATIONS WERE UPENDED BY CHINA AND TARIFFS (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Trump administration believed it had a plan to save TikTok last
Wednesday, but the Chinese government would not let the deal proceed
due to new tariffs on Chinese imports. President Trump extended the
deadline for a TikTok deal into mid-June in response. ByteDance was
reportedly comfortable with the new suggested plan, but even before
the tariff announcement, there was no guarantee that China would
approve of any deal. The talks about TikTok are likely to become even
more complicated as the trade war between the two countries escalates.

 ASK HN: DO YOU STILL USE SEARCH ENGINES? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [12] 

 More and more people are using large language models instead of
search engines, but many developers are finding that the technology is
not well suited to finding factual information. Search engines are
still better at finding specific links and real information. Large
language models can be helpful for many things, like helping someone
unfamiliar with a topic better refine their searches by getting the
terminology correct and exploring research topics. Search engines are
still required for many things as large language models get lots of
very important things wrong. 

 HOW APPLE STOCKPILED IPHONES TO AVOID TARIFFS AND KEEP PRICES LOW FOR
A WHILE (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple shipped five flights worth of Apple products in three days to
the US in the last week of March to stock its warehouses. This is
usually a time of the year when the company starts winding down its
current-year products and starts manufacturing its September releases.
The reserves that arrived at a lower duty will temporarily insulate
the company from the higher prices it will need to pay under the
revised tax rates. Apple is expected to take a $33 billion hit due to
the Trump Administration's newly instated tariff plan.
