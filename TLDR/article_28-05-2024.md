 APPLE SIGNS DEAL WITH OPENAI FOR IOS, STILL WANTS GOOGLE AS AN
'OPTION' (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple and OpenAI have signed a deal to provide chatbot functionality
in iOS 18. The deal will be a component of Apple's WWDC event in June.
It will allow Apple to continue working on its own chatbot, like how
it previously offered Google Maps before launching Apple Maps. Apple
is still working on a deal with Google to offer Gemini as an option.

 SCIENTISTS FOUND A PARADOX IN EVOLUTION ‚Äî AND IT MAY BECOME THE
NEXT RULE OF BIOLOGY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists from the University of Southern California have proposed a
new rule for biology called Selectively Advantageous Instability
(SAI). SAI explores how instability can actually benefit a cell or
organism. Instability allows for greater genetic diversity, which can
make organisms more adaptable. A shorter cell component lifespan can
actually help promote cell health. Understanding the process could aid
in the exploration of the biological processes behind disease and
aging.

 OLD DOGS, NEW CSS TRICKS (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While a lot of new CSS features have shipped in the last few years,
actual usage is still low. When learning new things, it's important
not to get overwhelmed. Don't try to refactor an entire codebase all
at once - pick achievable goals. While you don't have to use the
latest and greatest new CSS features, it's worth knowing which
specific problems these new techniques can solve so you can decide
whether they're a good fit for your project.

 WHAT ARE YOU GETTING PAID IN? (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 You can't always pay and motivate people with just money. You can pay
people in lots of currencies: quality of life, prestige, status,
impact, influence - just to name a few. People value different things
and want to be paid in different ways. By thinking creatively, you can
pay people in ways other than money. The best way to make sure you get
paid the way you want to is to pick the right industry. It's easier to
accumulate what you want through time and work than to try and convert
between currencies.
