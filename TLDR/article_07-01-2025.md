 IN 2025, PEOPLE WILL TRY LIVING IN THIS UNDERWATER HABITAT (7 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Ocean exploration organization Deep has embarked on a multiyear quest
to enable scientists to live on the sea floor at depths of up to 200
meters. It is currently developing and testing a small modular habitat
called Vanguard that is capable of housing up to three divers for up
to a week or so. Vanguard is a steppingstone to a more permanent
modular habitat system called Sentinel set to launch in 2027. Deep is
aiming for a permanent human presence in the ocean by 2030. Its plans
are possible thanks to an advanced 3D printing-welding approach that
can print these large habitation structures.

 MICROSOFT IS USING BING TO TRICK PEOPLE INTO THINKING THEY'RE ON
GOOGLE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Searching for Google on Bing (without signing in) takes users to a
page that looks a lot like Google. It's a clear attempt from Microsoft
to make Bing look like Google for this specific search query. Other
search results return without the special interface. Bing still
surfaces search results for Google underneath the spoofed Google UI.
Microsoft has used similar tactics over the years to convince people
to switch to its products.
