 PEERING THROUGH LENOVO‚ÄôS TRANSPARENT LAPTOP INTO A SCI-FI FUTURE (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lenovo's ThinkBook Transparent Display Laptop is a 17.3-inch notebook
with a see-through screen. Its bezel-less MicroLED display offers up
to 55% transparency when its pixels are set to black or turned off.
The display becomes less and less see-through as its pixels light up.
Due to technical challenges, the laptop's display resolution is only
720p and it is not currently possible to manually set the whole laptop
screen to be opaque. The laptop has a flat touch keyboard as its base
that is also designed to work as a drawing tablet. Pictures of the
device are available in the article. 

 THE ODYSSEUS LUNAR LANDER IS ON ITS SIDE AND WILL LIKELY RUN OUT OF
ENERGY SOON (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Odysseus lander will likely stop operating today as its panels
and antennas aren't oriented exactly as planned, making it difficult
to generate power and communicate. The lander almost failed its
landing due to issues with its range finder lasers, but a last-minute
software patch allowed engineers to use one of NASA's experimental
LIDAR systems to retrieve the required data to ensure its safe
landing. Despite this, Odysseus landed on its side. The only cargo on
the side facing down is a piece of art sent by a commercial customer.

 JUSTPATH (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 justpath is a utility for exploring the PATH environment variable in
both Windows and Linux. It can only view the PATH variable - neither
justpath nor any of its child processes can modify the shell PATH
directly. justpath provides a modified version of PATH that can later
be used in a shell startup script or with an environment manager. It
can be used to filter directory names, purge incorrect paths, create
new content strings for PATH, dump PATH as JSON, and more. 

 R2R (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 R2R is a semi-opinionated framework for the rapid deployment of
production-ready RAG systems. It aims to bridge the gap between
experimental RAG models and production-ready systems. R2R offers a
straightforward path to deploying, adapting, and maintaining RAG
pipelines in production. A short demo video is available.

 DECODING APPLE'S PLOY TO SCUTTLE PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS (24 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Apple plans to stop supporting Progressive Web Apps on March 6. The
EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) mandates that Apple must allow
competing browsers on its App Store. Apple's response to this is to
geofence browser choice and kneecap web apps. This choice will break
many apps across the EU, affecting schools, governments, startups,
gamers, and more. None of this is required by the DMA, despite Apple
blaming its decision on the law. By doing this, Apple is cementing a
future where the mobile web will never be permitted to grow beyond
marketing pages for native apps. 

 IN DEFENSE OF THIN WRAPPERS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Many apps find that their variable costs start skyrocketing once they
get some form of traction and grow. Having to deal with these issues
when growing is really hard as developers have to effectively rebuild
their engines while it's running. Founders can get in front of this
issue by planning ahead, having multiple choices for infrastructure,
finding good advisors, developing better negotiation skills, and
raising more money than needed as a buffer. This article discusses how
to handle rising costs as a startup, with a particular focus on
AI-based projects.
