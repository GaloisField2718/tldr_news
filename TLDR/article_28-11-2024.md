 INSIDE ELON MUSK'S QUEST TO BEAT OPENAI AT ITS OWN GAME (7 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk started xAI last summer. He poached talent from across the
industry in an effort to play catchup with OpenAI. The startup raised
at least $11 billion at a valuation of $50 billion in a funding round
this month. It is the second most valuable private AI developer behind
OpenAI. xAI plans to launch a stand-alone consumer app like ChatGPT as
soon as next month. 

 F.T.C. LAUNCHES ANTITRUST INVESTIGATION INTO MICROSOFT (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has opened an investigation into
whether Microsoft has violated antitrust law. The agency recently sent
a formal request for information to Microsoft asking about its cloud
computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity products. The
FTC is particularly interested in how the company bundles its cloud
computing offerings with office and security products and the
company's growing power in the artificial intelligence space.
Regulators in the European Union said earlier this year that Microsoft
had violated antitrust rules when it packaged Teams with Office tools
like Excel and Word.

 HUMANOID ROBOT FIGURE 02 IMPRESSES AT BMW PLANT WITH 400% EFFICIENCY
UPGRADE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figure AI has achieved a 400% increase in speed and a sevenfold
improvement in success rate in its Figure 02 robot. The company
recently released a video showing Figure 02 performing up to 1,000
placements per day at BMW's Spartanburg plant. The video is available
in the article. Figure AI plans to deploy more humanoid robots in
real-world environments in 2025. 

 DIAMOND OPTICAL DISCS COULD STORE DATA FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Chinese researchers have achieved a record-breaking diamond storage
density of 1.85 terabytes per cubic centimeter. The diamonds are able
to retain data for millions of years at room temperature without
requiring any maintenance. The system currently requires complex
lasers, imaging cameras, and other equipment, but the researchers
believe they will be able to eventually fit everything inside a
microwave oven-sized device. The technology will be particularly
useful for governments, research facilities, and large libraries.

 COMPARING AWS S3 WITH CLOUDFLARE R2: PRICE, PERFORMANCE AND USER
EXPERIENCE (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 R2 is a storage service by Cloudflare accessible through the S3 API
that doesn't charge any egress fees. Developers only pay for storage
and read/write/delete requests. This article looks at how R2 compares
to AWS' S3 service. S3 is better for latency, but more than 90% of
projects and organizations would be better served with R2.

 HAS AI SCALING HIT A LIMIT? (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The AI community has operated on the principle that intelligence
emerges from scale for the past four years. This has driven billions
in investment and reshaped the field of AI. Signs have emerged in
recent months that brute-force scaling alone might not be enough to
drive continued improvements in AI. The next breakthrough in AI might
not come from making current models bigger, but from making them
fundamentally different. 

 GOOGLE'S PLAN TO KEEP AI OUT OF SEARCH TRIAL REMEDIES ISN'T GOING
VERY WELL (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google's AI products may be restricted as a remedy following the
government's win in the search monopoly trial. The Department of
Justice has asked for a wide range of remedies to stop Google from
potentially using AI to entrench its market dominance in search
advertising. They include a ban on exclusive agreements with
publishers to train on content and restrictions on investments in or
acquisitions of AI products or companies. The DOJ alleges the changes
are necessary to clear the way for a thriving search market as AI
stands to shake up the competitive landscape.
