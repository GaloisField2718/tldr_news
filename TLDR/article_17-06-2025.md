 🚀 FASTER MOBILE APP RELEASES WITH 100% PARALLEL AUTOMATED QA
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf [5] gets mobile apps to 80% automated test coverage in weeks
[6]. They create and maintain your test suite in Appium (no vendor
lock-in) — and provide unlimited, 100% parallel test runs [7] with
zero flakes.

✅ QA cycles reduced from hours to less than 15 minutes

✅ Tests run on real iOS devices and Android emulators

✅ Flake-free runs, no false positives

✅ Human-verified bug reports

No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No more bugs
reaching production.

 OPENAI AND MICROSOFT TENSIONS ARE REACHING A BOILING POINT (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 OpenAI wants to loosen Microsoft's grip on its products and computing
resources and secure approval for its conversion into a for-profit
company, but negotiations have been difficult. The company's
executives have discussed the option of accusing Microsoft of
anticompetitive behavior during their partnership - this could result
in a regulatory review of the terms of the contract for potential
violations of antitrust law. OpenAI must complete its conversion to a
public-benefit corporation by the end of the year or it risks losing
$20 billion in funding. 

 WHATSAPP IS OFFICIALLY GETTING ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 WhatsApp will now show ads from businesses through its Stories-like
status feature. Ads will be tailored to users using limited
information, like location, language, and followed channels. Users can
change their ad preferences from Meta's Accounts Center. WhatsApp will
now also start showing promoted channels when users click on the
Explore button and it is rolling out the ability to subscribe to
channels to receive exclusive updates.

 DANISH MILITARY USING ROBOTIC SAILBOATS FOR SURVEILLANCE IN BALTIC
AND NORTH SEAS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Denmark's armed forces are trialing uncrewed robotic sailboats known
as Voyagers. The 10-meter-long vessels carry no crew and are designed
for surveillance. Powered by wind and solar energy, they can operate
autonomously for months at sea. The vessels carry advanced sensors,
including radar, infrared and optical cameras, and sonar. They are
aimed at identifying maritime threats like damage to undersea cables,
illegal fishing, and smuggling. 

 FINLAND WARMS UP THE WORLD'S LARGEST SAND BATTERY, AND THE ECONOMICS
LOOK APPEALING (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A small town in Finland recently started using the world's largest
sand-based battery. Sand batteries are a type of thermal storage
system that uses sand or crushed rock to store heat, which can be
later used for various things like warming buildings. They are
typically 'charged' by using electricity to heat the sand. The battery
will help slash carbon emissions and help the town eliminate the
costly oil that currently helps power its district heating network.
The cost of the project has not been revealed, but the raw materials
were cheap and the structure itself isn't particularly complex.

 CODING AGENTS HAVE CROSSED A CHASM (13 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Over the past few months, autonomous AI coding agents have gone from
a neat curiosity to something some developers can't imagine working
without. The technology has moved from a 'smarter autocomplete' to
something you can genuinely delegate tasks to. These new tools can be
incredible force multipliers, especially when users have enough
knowledge to be good editors. However, they can be dangerous
accelerants for confusion when users are out of their depth. The pace
of improvement suggests we're still in the early stages of the shift -
every week brings new capabilities. 

 CANINE (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Canine is a deployment platform for Kubernetes clusters. It makes it
easy to deploy and manage applications. A modern alternative to
Heroku, Canine makes cheap hosting providers as easy to use as
expensive ones. Canine has everything needed to deploy an app,
including GitHub integration, one-click deployments and rollbacks, SSL
certificate management, and easy autoscaling.

 SCALE AI'S WANG BRINGS TO META KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS
DOING (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Alexandr Wang co-founded Scale AI, which recently received a $14.3
billion investment from Meta, at 19. Wang is known for his ability to
cultivate influential relationships and to know what's going on in the
AI industry. He has a direct relationship with a dizzying amount of
people, in both junior and senior roles, and knows what they're
working on and what they want to be doing. Meta's recent investment
means that the company now has the one guy who knows what everyone
else in the AI industry doing. 

 META AND OAKLEY TEASE A SMART GLASSES ANNOUNCEMENT FOR JUNE 20 (1
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A new Instagram account called @oakleymeta has teased a video
announcement for this Friday, with Instagram's own official account
and Mark Zuckerberg sharing the post on their stories. Meta's web
store has a banner saying 'The next evolution arrives June 20' and an
option to sign up for updates on products, news, and innovations. This
all indicates that Oakley Meta glasses will likely be announced this
week. The video is available in the article.

 WHY GENERATIVE AI CODING TOOLS AND AGENTS DO NOT WORK FOR ME (5
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 People who claim that AI makes them faster or more productive are
making a conscious decision to relax their quality standards or they
personally benefit from selling AI. 

 THE STATE OF ENGINEERING LEADERSHIP IN 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 60% of engineering leaders believe that AI has not significantly
boosted their team's productivity, 50% worry there are fewer jobs
available, and 40% believe their team is less motivated to come to
work than they were 12 months ago. 

 RESEARCHERS CLAIM SPOOF-PROOF RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR BREAKTHROUGH (2
MINUTE READ) [22] 

 For a bad actor to control the final output of the random-number
generator undetected, the records of the entanglement measurements and

experiment's disparate geographical locations.

end-to-end network stability is out of Sony's control, so there is
still demand for the local execution of games.
