 CHATGPT'S MOBILE APP JUST HAD ITS BIGGEST MONTH YET (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The launch of GPT-4o sent ChatGPT's revenue soaring - it pulled in
$28 million in net revenue from the App Store and Google Play in July.
The app grossed $39.9 million before paying in-app purchase fees.
ChatGPT saw an estimated 2 million new paying customers last month.
Growth is expected to continue in the months to come. 

 REDDIT CONSIDERS SEARCH ADS, PAYWALLED CONTENT FOR THE FUTURE (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Reddit's plans for making more money from the platform include
showing ads in more places and possibly putting some content behind a
paywall. The company, which has never been profitable, lost $10.1
million during Q2 2024, down from Q2 2023's $41.1 million loss. It
recently blocked all search engines besides Google, OpenAI, and
approved education/research instances from showing its content in
search results. Reddit seems to be trying to capitalize on how people
use its name as a filter for search results.

 NASA SAYS BOEING STARLINER ASTRONAUTS MAY FLY HOME ON SPACEX IN 2025
(6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NASA has downplayed the problems experienced by Boeing's Starliner
since it took two astronauts to the International Space Station in
June. Officials finally admitted on Wednesday that the issues may be
more serious than first thought and that the astronauts might not
return on Starliner. The agency is exploring a backup option for the
astronauts. The astronauts were meant to stay for around eight days,
but that could be extended into next year.

 WHY WE PICKED AGPL (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The AGPL license permits free use, modification, and distribution of
software, provided that distributed, derivative works of the software
are released under the same license. It ensures that modifications
remain open and discourages proprietary forks. The license allows code
to be open source without companies having to worry about other
vendors reselling their projects without consent, giving them the
confidence to monetize without fear of predatory competition.

 DON'T PIVOT INTO AI RESEARCH (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Chip design used to be a high-profile role, with the most famous chip
designers viewed similarly to how famous machine learning researchers
are seen today. Many students flocked to the industry as the number of
chip companies boomed and the field was in demand. However, as market
dynamics changed, the supply of hardware engineers grew too high. The
high capital costs for chip manufacturing drove the number of
employers down to a handful of major chip makers. The field of AI
research will likely play out the same way. 

 GOOGLE ANTITRUST VERDICT LEAVES APPLE WITH ‚ÄúINCONVENIENT
ALTERNATIVES‚Äù (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Apple benefited greatly from Google's monopoly. While the Department
of Justice has not yet said what it will seek for a remedy to the
antitrust case, Apple will likely be deeply involved. Apple could be
forced to accept a much less lucrative agreement with Microsoft or may
be prevented from selling search defaults at all. Mozilla may also be
heavily impacted by the decision - Google's 2021 payment to the
company for the default position on its browser was about 80 percent
of Mozilla's operating budget.
