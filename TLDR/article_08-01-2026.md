 OPENAI LAUNCHES CHATGPT HEALTH TO CONNECT USER MEDICAL RECORDS,
WELLNESS APPS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 ChatGPT Health allows users to securely connect their medical records
and wellness apps to the platform. The feature is supposed to help
users navigate everyday questions rather than intended for diagnosis
or treatment. The data will make ChatGPT's responses more relevant by
grounding them in user data. ChatGPT Health will initially be made
available to a small group of test users. OpenAI will expand access in
the coming weeks. 

 THE WAYMO OJAI WILL SOON OFFER AUTONOMOUS RIDES AROUND THE US (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Waymo is preparing to update its lineup with a new van built by
Chinese automaker Zeekr and a modified Hyundai Ioniq 5s. The vehicles
will be added to Waymo's growing operations this year, but the company
has yet to specify which cities will see them. The Zeekr vehicle will
be called the Waymo Ojai in the US. Zeekr will construct the body of
the van in China before shipping it to the US, where Waymo will fit
its software suite and array of sensors. The vehicle will not be
affected by US regulations aimed at preventing Chinese cars from being
sold to customers in the US.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 INSIDE THE SUB-ZERO LAIR OF THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL COMPUTER (10
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Quantum computing holds the key to winning the rest of the 21st
Century. Google's quantum AI lab in Santa Barbara contains Willow,
Google's latest quantum chip. Willow has settled the discussion about
whether quantum computers can do tasks that classical computers can't,
and it has also solved a benchmark problem in minutes that would have
taken the best computer in the world 10 septillion years. This article
gives readers a tour through the Santa Barbara lab and discusses the
state of quantum computing and the potential impacts it may have in
the future. 

 THE GOLDEN AGE OF VACCINE DEVELOPMENT (32 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Vaccine technology has changed inconceivably in the 230 years since
the accidental discovery of the first vaccine. Many diseases that
plagued humanity are now mostly forgotten. It has become far easier
and faster to develop new vaccines, and they can be engineered to be
safer and more precise than ever before. With progress speeding up in
recent years, the golden age of vaccine development seems imminent.

 THE MODERN AI PM IN THE AGE OF AGENTS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The job of the PM used to be to translate what customers want into
specs that would be handed to engineers. That translation layer is
compressing. PMs are now writing specs for AI agents to implement. The
bottleneck has shifted upstream as the implementation barrier has
dropped. The scarce resource is now knowing what's actually worth
building. 

 AI'S IMPACT ON TAILWIND (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 75% of Tailwind's engineering team lost their jobs due to the impact
AI has had on the business. Traffic to Tailwind's docs is down about
40% from early 2023. The docs are the only way for people to discover
Tailwind's commercial products, so this is resulting in less income
for the project. While Tailwind is growing faster than ever and is
bigger than it has ever been, its revenue is down close to 80%.

 CONSUMER AI PREDICTIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Phones are too powerful - screenless AI devices will flop, as will
'always listening' devices. Mini-apps will unlock UGC personal
software. There will be two big general-purpose AI chatbots by 2030.
Performance marketing for apps is dead. The fastest consumer product
to reach $1 billion ARR will be an AI webcam girl. Whoever figures out
how to unlock use cases for AI beyond search and chat will be the next
big consumer platform. 

 MICROSOFT'S WOULD-HAVE-BEEN $30B "HACKQUISITION" OF OPENAI (6 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Microsoft's 'hackquisition' of Inflection in 2024 was groundbreaking
and led basically all of its rivals to copy the same general
structure. Microsoft first conceived the plan when Sam Altman was
ousted as CEO in November 2023. It had planned to hire the entire
company if OpenAI refused to reinstate Altman. Altman was quickly
reinstated, but the situation clearly planted the seed that would grow
into the 'hackquisition' model.
