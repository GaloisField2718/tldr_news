 THE FURIOUS CONTEST TO UNSEAT NVIDIA AS KING OF A.I. CHIPS (10 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Amazon, AMD, and several other startups are starting to offer
credible alternatives to Nvidia's chips. Nvidia's rivals are proving
they can deliver faster speeds at lower prices for some crucial AI
tasks. Many are emulating Nvidia's tactic of building complete
computers so that customers can gain maximum power and performance out
of their chips. Spending on computers without Nvidia chips by data
center operators is expected to grow 49% this year to $126 billion. 

 META JOINS THE NUCLEAR-POWERED AI FRAY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta is turning to nuclear energy to support its data centers and the
communities around them. It recently announced a 'request for
proposals' for developers that can bring nuclear reactors online
starting in the early 2030s. The company is open to many ideas on the
size and type of reactors, the locations, and other details. It is
seeking initial responses by February 7.

 A NEW METHOD TO MAP THE BRAIN: INFECT IT WITH A VIRUS (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 E11 Bio has been working for the past three years to develop
techniques to make brain mapping better, cheaper, and faster. One of
these approaches involves making the brain label itself by injecting
it with viruses that cause neurons to make special proteins that act
like barcodes. The approach reduces the amount of brain slicing
required and creates more accurate wiring maps that require less
proofreading. E11 is now shifting from proof-of-concept mode to
building out its imaging infrastructure so it can tackle an entire
mouse brain. 

 USC STUDENT ROCKET GROUP SHATTERS INTERNATIONAL AMATEUR SPACE RECORD
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The USC Rocket Propulsion Lab at the USC Viterbi School of
Engineering has broken the international altitude record with its
Aftershock II rocket. The rocket reached an altitude of 470,000 feet,
higher than any non-governmental and non-commercial group has ever
flown before. Aftershock II, at 330 pounds with a height of 13 ft and
8” diameter, reached a velocity of 5,283 ft/s and Mach 5.5. A video
of the launch is available in the article.

 IS AURORA DSQL YOUR NEXT DATABASE? (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Amazon's new Aurora DSQL is a serverless, globally distributed
database that is highly available, multi-regional, Postgres
compatible, and fast. This post looks over its features to see if the
product works as advertised. Aurora DSQL is still very new - the
service is only available in two US regions at the moment. It is still
missing a lot of features from Postgres and uses an unusual
authentication method that involves using a URL-like token to connect
to the database. 

 SKIA CANVAS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Skia Canvas is a browser-less implementation of the HTML Canvas
drawing API for Node.js. It produces very similar results to Chrome's
canvas element. Skia Canvas is best used on desktop machines that can
render hardware-accelerated graphics to a window or on a server where
it can output a variety of image formats.

 THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS WANTING TO SWITCH JOBS HITS A 10-YEAR HIGH (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 More than half of US workers are watching for or actively seeking a
new job. Job satisfaction has fallen to its lowest level in recent
years. The cooling job market is causing employees to feel more stuck
and frustrated. While employers can worry less about turnover, they
risk employee burnout rising if workers feel stuck. 

 Y COMBINATOR AND POWER IN SILICON VALLEY (18 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AdGrok's founders received notice that their company was being sued
by Adchemy, a former employer, in September 2010. The legal action was
not unexpected as the former employer had told them they were unhappy
with the founders leaving and starting a new company. AdGrok had gone
through Y Combinator. Its relationship with the accelerator program
and Sam Altman resulted in the lawsuit being dismissed. Adchemy was
attempting to court funding from Microsoft - Altman had a contact at
Microsoft tell Adchemy that it would be problematic if the company was
embroiled in litigation while discussing the deal, so Adchemy dropped
the suit
