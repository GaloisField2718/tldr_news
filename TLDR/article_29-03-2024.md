 SAM BANKMAN-FRIED SENTENCED TO 25 YEARS FOR FTX FRAUD (4 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been sentenced to a total of 300
months in prison for seven counts of conspiracy and fraud charges. He
has also been ordered to forfeit more than $11 billion, including
property. The sentence is shorter than the 40 to 50 years requested by
the prosecutors, but longer than the six and a half years his lawyers
asked for and far less than the maximum of 110 years. Bankman-Fried
has been residing in custody since August 2023, where he has been
subjected to multiple extortion attempts. 

 FACEBOOK LET NETFLIX SEE USER DMS, QUIT STREAMING TO KEEP NETFLIX
HAPPY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Facebook Watch, announced in 2017, never really took off. Recently
revealed documents show the company's plans for the platform and how
it was confident in its ability to compete with Netflix. Mark
Zuckerberg abruptly announced a change in strategy in May 2018,
suddenly slashing the budget for the platform. He claimed the budget
changes were based on his knowledge of the company's strategy and
financial outlook. Months later, Facebook and Netflix announced a new
data-sharing agreement that involved Netflix reaching $200 million in
advertising spend by 2019. The companies also had a data-sharing
agreement that may have allowed Netflix to access Facebook users'
private messages.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 HOW WE’LL REACH A 1 TRILLION TRANSISTOR GPU (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Recent achievements in AI have been due to three factors: innovation
in efficient machine-learning algorithms, the availability of massive
amounts of data to train neural networks, and progress in
energy-efficient computing through the advancement of semiconductor
technology. The industry will need much more powerful devices to
continue at its current pace. For the past 50 years, the industry has
focused on shrinking the transistor, but now, there are many more
possibilities. Future GPUs will not be restricted to the sizes and
form factors of current devices - integrated AI systems will be
composed of as many energy-efficient transistors as is practical. 

 MEMORIES ARE MADE BY BREAKING DNA — AND FIXING IT (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 A study in mice shows that memories are formed from breaks in DNA.
These breaks occur due to a rush of electrical activity and are
repaired using an inflammatory response. The findings suggest a
mechanism for faulty memory in people with neurodegenerative diseases.

 A FEW THOUGHTS ON THE DOJ’S ANTITRUST CASE AGAINST APPLE (7 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 None of the things mentioned in the DOJ's case against Apple should
be a surprise to anyone who has been following in the Apple space for
years. People have been hoping the company would change or tweak its
ways in many of these areas. While Apple's actions may be
disagreeable, they may not be illegal. The DOJ is fighting an uphill
battle with its case, but it will hopefully apply some pressure on
Apple to loosen its grip on some things.
