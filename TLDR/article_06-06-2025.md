 AGENTIC AI IS CHANGING EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT PROCESS ORCHESTRATION
– LEARN HOW (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Traditional automation is no match for today's complexity. Agentic
workflows [5]—autonomous, goal-driven agents collaborating to
achieve business goals—require more than prompt engineering. They
need a powerful workflow engine to orchestrate tasks, decisions, and
outcomes at scale—with humans in the loop when it matters most. .

The latest webinar by Orkes [4] explored how combining agentic AI and
process orchestration [4]can enable businesses to integrate AI-driven
decision-making, streamline workflows, and scale with ease. Tune in to
learn:

 	* Why traditional rules-based systems (such as Appian/Pega) fall
short
 	* How AI-driven decision-making transforms workflows by enhancing
adaptability
 	* Practical use cases, from supply chain to financial services to
healthcare.

 AMC NETWORKS INKS DEAL WITH AI COMPANY RUNWAY (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AMC plans to use AI company Runway's technology to both generate
marketing images and help pre-visualize shows that have yet to be
produced. The AI production images could help showrunners figure out
what would or wouldn't work on the air without the high cost of
shooting the material or designing from scratch. They are not intended
to be used in shows at this point. Other studios are also tinkering
with AI models, but they are staying silent about it due to the early
nature of the tech and the sensitivity of the issue with Hollywood
guilds.
