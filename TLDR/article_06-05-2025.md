 🚀 FASTER MOBILE APP RELEASES WITH 100% PARALLEL AUTOMATED QA
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf [5] gets mobile apps to 80% automated test coverage in weeks
[6]. They create and maintain your test suite in Appium (no vendor
lock-in) — and provide unlimited, 100% parallel test runs [7] with
zero flakes.

✅ QA cycles reduced from hours to less than 15 minutes

✅ Tests run on real iOS devices and Android emulators

✅ Flake-free runs, no false positives

✅ Human-verified bug reports

No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No more bugs
reaching production.

 MICROSOFT IS KEY HOLDOUT FOR OPENAI RESTRUCTURING PLAN (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Microsoft has still not yet approved OpenAI's plans for
restructuring. The conversion will also need the approval of the state
attorneys general of California and Delaware. Microsoft wants to make
sure that any changes to OpenAI's structure adequately protects its
investment. It is still actively negotiating the details of OpenAI's
proposal. OpenAI will move forward with the effort to restructure its
for-profit division as a public benefit corporation, but the overall
business will remain under the control of its nonprofit. 

 WAYMO RAMPS UP ROBOTAXI PRODUCTION AT NEW ARIZONA FACTORY (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Waymo currently has more than 1,500 commercial robotaxis in
operation. It is working with Magna to build more than 2,000
autonomous I-Pace vehicles at a new factory in Arizona. The factory is
strategically located in one of Waymo's robotaxi markets and close to
its other service areas. Vehicles will be able to pick up their first
public passengers less than 30 minutes after leaving the factory. The
plant will be capable of building tens of thousands of fully
autonomous Waymo vehicles per year when operating at full capacity.

 AMATEUR ATHLETES ARE TURNING TO OZEMPIC TO RAISE THEIR GAME (6 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Many athletes are taking GLP-1 weight-loss drugs to gain a
performance edge. The practice has caught the attention of the World
Anti-Doping Agency. If the organization finds that semaglutide
enhances performance, poses a health risk, or violates 'the spirit of
the sport', it could end up on its banned list. However, making that
determination is complex, and the drug's effects could have different
outcomes depending on the sport. 

 UBER AND WERIDE SET THEIR ROBOTAXI SIGHTS ON 15 MORE CITIES (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Uber and Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide plan to
bring robotaxi services to another 15 cities over the next five years.
The expansion will focus on cities outside of China and the United
States and include cities in Europe. Uber has more than 15
partnerships with a wide range of autonomous vehicle technology
companies, the highest-profile of which is with Waymo. Uber and Waymo
will soon launch a robotaxi service in Atlanta.

 GOOGLE ACCIDENTALLY REVEALS ANDROID'S MATERIAL 3 EXPRESSIVE INTERFACE
AHEAD OF I/O (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's next version of Android might look quite different. The
company recently published and quickly removed a blog post that
detailed 'Material 3 Expressive', a redesign expected to be revealed
at I/O later this month. While the original Material Design did a good
job of leveraging colors and consistent theming, it made apps look too
similar. The new interface appears much more varied. Screenshots from
the deleted blog post are available in the article.

 AN INTERVIEW WITH META CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG ABOUT AI AND THE EVOLUTION
OF SOCIAL MEDIA (68 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This is a transcript of an interview with Mark Zuckerberg where he
discusses the broader themes that place Llama in Meta's historical
context. The interview covers Meta's platform ambitions over the last
two decades, the evolution of social networking, and how Zuckerberg
has changed his thinking about both. Zuckerberg talks about the Llama
API and the tension between GPU opportunity cost and leveraging
training costs, and why he thinks that the latter is worth paying for.
He also discusses why Meta AI may actually bring many of his oldest
ideas full circle, how that ties into Reality Labs, and why Meta ended
up being the perfect name for the company. 

 I'D RATHER READ THE PROMPT (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 People shouldn't let computers write for them. Their original
thoughts are far more interesting, meaningful, and valuable than
whatever a large language model can transform them into. Writing
should be a medium for communicating original thoughts - if it's not
worth writing, it's not worth reading. Language models are great for
making nonsense and not so great for anything else - it's probably
better to just read the prompt.

 AI CODE IS LEGACY CODE FROM DAY ONE (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 AI-generated software starts off already aged, and the people
maintaining the code aren't its original creators, making it legacy

 LLMS AS UNBIASED ORACLES (2 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Large language models can be used in automated black box testing, not
just as a post-hoc verification step, but as a foundational driver for
the code generation process itself.

bid to break up Meta.
