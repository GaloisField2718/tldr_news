 ARTISTS LEAK OPENAI'S SORA VIDEO GENERATOR (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A group of artists recently made a post claiming that OpenAI was
using them as unpaid beta testers for Sora, OpenAI's video generator,
and that the company was pressuring them to spin a positive narrative
around the tool. OpenAI required every video clip to be approved
before sharing, suggesting that the early access program was less
about creative expression and critique and more about PR and
advertisement. The artists leaked a version of Sora on Hugging Face
that could create 10-second clips but OpenAI shut down early access
for all artists three hours after it was posted. The artists said in
their post that they hope OpenAI becomes more open, more artist
friendly, and supports the arts beyond PR stunts. 

 AI'S FUTURE AND NVIDIA'S FORTUNES RIDE ON THE RACE TO PACK MORE CHIPS
INTO ONE PLACE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The most ambitious players in the AI race are now building super
clusters of computer servers that cost billions of dollars and contain
unprecedented numbers of Nvidia's most advanced chips. The push
towards superclusters could help Nvidia sustain its growth trajectory.
The trend is fostering demand for Nvidia's networking equipment, which
is fast becoming a significant business. Nvidia's Blackwell chips,
which are several times as powerful as its current chips, are set to
start shipping in the next couple of months.

 NASA'S SEARCH FOR LIFE: SPACEX TO LAUNCH DRAGONFLY MISSION TO
SATURN'S MOON (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NASA has announced a $256.6 million contract with SpaceX to support
the launch of the Dragonfly mission. Dragonfly is a nuclear-powered
spacecraft about the size of a Mars Rover that is capable of flight
like a drone. It will be sent to Saturn's moon Titan to characterize
the habitability of Titan's environment, investigate the progression
of prebiotic chemistry on the moon, and search for chemical
indications of whether water-based or hydrocarbon-based life ever
existed on the Titan. The mission is expected to launch in July 2028
on SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in
Florida. 

 CHINA PLANS TO BUILD EGG IGLOOS ON LUNAR SURFACE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 China has unveiled a mock-up of a moon colony that shows a handful of
egg-shaped gray igloos and space rovers with Lego-like spacemen
grounding between them. The model is a result of careful examination
of the conditions on the moon, where there is a lack of raw materials,
extreme temperature fluctuations, and cosmic radiation. China is
planning to establish a permanent base on the moon by 2035 and is
developing detailed plans accordingly. Pictures of the model are
available in the article.

 WHICH IDES DO SOFTWARE ENGINEERS LOVE, AND WHY? (20 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Cursor, an AI-first code editor, is rapidly gaining popularity, with
more developers preferring it over VS Code + Copilot or JetBrains IDE
+ Copilot. It appears most IDE vendors are offering generative AI
capabilities at a loss. Engineers making heavy use of code generation
are likely getting good value for money in terms of the compute
required for code generation on larger codebases. This article looks
over the several AI-focused IDEs available and useful features for
developers.

 GOOGLE AND THE DOJ MAKE THEIR FINAL ARGUMENTS IN THE AD TECH MONOPOLY
CASE (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google and the Department of Justice have made their closing
arguments in the antitrust case against Google. The DOJ argued that
Google used a suite of ad tech products to strong-arm site owners and
advertisers. Google countered that it faces competition from other
sources and shouldn't have to cut deals with competitors. US District
Court judge Leonie Brinkema is expected to rule on the case by the end
of 2024. 

 BUILDING LLMS IS PROBABLY NOT GOING BE A BRILLIANT BUSINESS (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Large language models are cool, but that doesn't mean that building
them is going to be a profitable business. What makes a good business
is industry structure. Airlines have unfavorable industry structure,
with only two makers of airplanes, fickle and unloyal customers, and
high amounts of competition. The fizzy-drinks business has a very
favorable industry structure - fizzy drinks are easy to make,
customers aren't very picky, and it isn't easy for new competitors to
enter the market. The industry structure for large language model
makers isn't very good - there is only one true supplier (Nvidia),
there doesn't seem to be any brand loyalty being built up, and there
is a lot of competition in the market.
