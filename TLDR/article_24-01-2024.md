 HOW DESIGN DROVE $10M IN PREORDERS FOR RABBIT R1 AI HARDWARE (11
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Rabbit R1 is a bright orange walkie-talkie for AI. It features
one big button that users push to talk, a chunky scroll wheel to
browse the screen, and a rotating camera with its own privacy door. At
$199, the device can be programmed to control apps and websites. This
article tells the story of how Rabbit and Teenage Engineering
collaborated to create what may be the most successful AI hardware
launch to date. 

 THE PIXEL 9 LEAKS ARE ALREADY HERE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Pictures of what appears to be Google's Pixel 9 Pro flagship have
been leaked. They show a device with completely flat edges and a
redesigned camera bar. The Pixel 9 Pro features a three-camera setup
inside an oval-shaped island, similar to the Pixel Fold. It appears to
be slightly smaller than the Pixel 8 Pro with a 6.5-inch display. The
SIM card slot now appears to be on the bottom of the device alongside
the USB-C port. Google typically releases its Pixel phones every fall.

 THE START-UPS MAKING ROBOTS A REALITY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article presents a list of cutting-edge robotics startups and
labs that Bill Gates is excited about. The last year has seen
advancements in artificial intelligence that have resulted in programs
that can create, calculate, process, understand, decide, recognize
patterns, and learn in ways that resemble how humans learn. However,
many robots still struggle to perform basic human tasks that require
dexterity, mobility, and cognition. The applications for robots are
almost limitless. While there will be issues with robots taking
people's jobs, it's less likely that robots will replace jobs that
people love and more likely that they'll be doing work people don't
want to do. 

 CAN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES BE CURED? SCIENTISTS SEE HOPE AT LAST (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists are on the cusp of developing therapies to restore immune
tolerance in conditions such as diabetes, lupus, and multiple
sclerosis. Tolerance refers to the immune system's ability to ignore
antigens that belong to the body while appropriately attacking those
that don't. Current therapies for these diseases don't always work,
and even when they do, the improvement is often modest. Results from
studies are starting to show that it is possible to create curative
treatments for these diseases. This article looks at several
approaches that scientists are looking at to make those treatments a
reality.

 TYPESPEC (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 TypeSpec is a language for describing cloud service APIs and
generating other API description languages, client and service code,
documentation, and other assets. It provides highly extensible core
language primitives that can describe API shapes common among REST,
OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC, and other protocols. TypeSpec can create
reusable patterns that establish guardrails for API designers and make
it easy to follow best practices. A playground is available for trying
TypeSpec without installing anything.

 THE TREMENDOUS YET TROUBLED STATE OF GAMING IN 2024 (82 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 2023 looked like one of the gaming industry's greatest-ever years to
players and outside observers. There were many top-title releases, and
hardware developments offered substantial improvements to the gaming
experience. However, the year was brutal for those working in the
industry. A record number of employees in the industry were laid off
in 2023, and these layoffs have continued in 2024. Video game revenues
are falling and development costs have grown considerably.
