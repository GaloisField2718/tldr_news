 MACS TO GET AI-FOCUSED M4 CHIPS STARTING IN LATE 2024 (1 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 The entire Mac lineup may get the M4 chip in late 2024 and early
2025. The chip will start appearing in the iMac, MacBook Pros, and Mac
mini machines first before being implemented into the MacBook Air, Mac
Studio, and Mac Pro. The M4 processor is expected to come in at least
three varieties. It will feature an improved Neural Engine with an
increased number of cores for AI tasks. 

 HUMANE AI HANDS-ON: MY LIFE SO FAR WITH A WEARABLE AI PIN (9 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 While the Humane AI Pin could be the future of wearables, it doesn't
currently have enough consistency or connectivity. This article
reviews the device and describes what it is like using it. There is
still a lot of room for improvement, for example, the laser display
can be hard to read and the interface can be difficult to navigate.
The device also overheats after a few minutes of use.

 ESA SATELLITES TO TEST RAZOR-SHARP FORMATION FLYING (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The European Space Agency will launch a mission later this year to
demonstrate precision formation flying in orbit to create artificial
solar eclipses. The mission will involve a pair of spacecraft that
will fly about 144 meters apart, with one spacecraft acting as a disc
to block out the sun from the other spacecraft. This will allow the
ESA to study the Sun's highly ionized atmosphere. The formation flying
technology could be used for other future missions as well. 

 RESEARCHERS FIND A NEW ORGANELLE EVOLVING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Endosymbiosis is a process in which a once free-living organism is
incorporated into a cell. This can result in the organism becoming an
organelle, a compartment within cells surrounded by membranes that
performs specialized functions. Researchers may have found a new case
of the extremely rare event. An organelle devoted to fixing nitrogen
from the atmosphere is being observed in the process of
specialization. Called a nitroplast, the organelle is limited to a
single lineage of algae, likely due to its relatively recent origin,
with the relationship between the nitroplast and its host cell only
dating back about 100 million years.

 I ASKED 100 DEVS WHY THEY AREN'T SHIPPING FASTER. HERE'S WHAT I
LEARNED (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The things that slow devs down depend on the company size, culture,
the nature of the product, and the composition of the team. This
article looks at what engineers from big tech companies think is
slowing them down. Many devs say that build, compile, and deployment
times are the main things slowing them down. Other factors include
dependency bugs, complicated codebases, development processes, tests,
and reviews. 

 PREDICTIVE CPU ISOLATION OF CONTAINERS AT NETFLIX (11 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Computer architecture design has evolved towards adding various
levels of caching between compute units and the main memory to hide
latency. These caches are partially shared among the CPUs, so perfect
performance isolation of co-hosted containers is not possible.
Netflix's team was able to meaningfully improve both the
predictability and performance of its containers by taking some of the
CPU isolation responsibility away from the operating system and moving
towards a data-driven solution involving combinatorial optimization
and machine learning. This post explains the process in detail.

 APPLE OPENS ACCESS TO USED IPHONE COMPONENTS FOR REPAIR (7 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Apple has opened its iPhone repair process to include used components
for the iPhone 15. Customers and independent repair shops will be able
to fix iPhones starting this fall using compatible components,
including the battery, display, and camera. Face ID will not be
available when the feature first rolls out but will be implemented
later. Apple has no plans to sell refurbished parts for user repairs. 

 AMAZON CEO TOUTS AI REVOLUTION WHILE COMMITTING TO COST CUTS (6
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In his annual letter to shareholders, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy laid out
a vision for how generative AI could become the company's next pillar
of growth. The company has invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic
and added prominent computer scientist and AI expert Dr. Andrew Ng to
its board. Amazon is taking a three-pronged approach to AI innovation:
it will focus on AI models, applications built on top of the models,
and the chips that power the technology. The company is optimistic
that a lot of world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.
