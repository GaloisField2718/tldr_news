 TESLA SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE ELON MUSK'S $1 TRILLION PAY PACKAGE (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla shareholders have voted to approve a plan to motivate Elon Musk
with a bonus of as much as $1 trillion in additional stock. Musk had
threatened on social media to leave the company if the measure was
rejected. He claimed he wanted a big enough ownership stake in Tesla
so that he couldn't be fired, so the 'robot army' he is developing
doesn't fall into the wrong hands. The new pay package includes 12
chunks of stock that could give Musk control of as much as 25% of
Tesla if he hits a series of milestones in the next decade. 

 GOOGLE'S IRONWOOD TPUS REPRESENT A BIGGER THREAT THAN NVIDIA WOULD
HAVE YOU BELIEVE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's latest generation of Ironwood accelerators will become
generally available in the coming weeks. The TPU v7 accelerators are a
major leap in performance over prior generations. They offer
performance close to Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, when normalizing
floating point perf to the same precision. The TPUs can be scaled into
truly enormous compute domains - Google is offering the chips in pods
of 256 up to 9,216.

 THE UAE IS WINNING THE RACE TO SEQUENCE AN ENTIRE COUNTRY'S DNA (22
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The UAE's Emirate Genome Programme started six years ago with the
goal of mapping the genetic code of all of the nation's around one
million citizens. The country believes that gene sequencing is both a
public-health project and a key part of the country's
multitrillion-dollar effort to refashion itself from a petrostate into
an AI powerhouse. The project has already collected DNA samples from
more than 750,000 Emirates. Efforts to pair AI with genomic data have
yet to yield profitable drugs, but many believe they will soon. 

 AI TURNS BRAIN SCANS INTO FULL SENTENCES AND IT'S EERIE TO SAY THE
LEAST (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 'Mind captioning' is a method developed at NTT Communication Science
Laboratories in Japan that uses a blend of brain images and AI to
generate text descriptions of what people are seeing (or even
visualizing) based only on their neural patterns. In tests, the system
was able to correctly describe scenes viewed by participants about
half the time, even when presented with a hundred possibilities - and
even when participants were just visualizing the scenes in their mind.
The technology is still far from being a mind-reading device, but it
could have serious ethical implications when it becomes more capable.

 YOU SHOULD WRITE AN AGENT (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Some concepts are easy to grasp in the abstract, but others you
really need to try before you understand them. Regardless of whether
or not LLM agents are snake oil or not, it's worth learning how to
make one - startups are raising millions building agents at a time
when nobody really knows anything yet. It's easy to get started. This
post walks readers through how to create an agent. 

 DEAD FRAMEWORK THEORY (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 As large language models become more dominant, new frameworks will
find it hard to gain traction because the models won't have enough
training data about them. The industry needs to innovate and build new
frameworks, libraries, and platform features to push the web forward
and create competition. Developers need to have clear strategies to
get their work into the LLM training corpus, system prompts, and
developer minds. If the industry continues its current focus on
maintainability and developer experience, we'll end up in a world
where the web is built by LLMs using only what is entrenched in the
training data.

 OPENAI RACES TO QUELL CONCERNS OVER ITS FINANCES (6 MINUTE READ) [13]


 OpenAI's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, raised concerns after
she mentioned the prospect of government aid for the company at a
recent conference. Friar has since made a post clarifying her
statement, saying that she was making the point that US strength in
technology will come from building real industrial capacity, which
requires the private sector and government to play their parts. David
Sacks, the White House's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said
the federal government has no intention of providing any kind of
bailout to AI companies.
