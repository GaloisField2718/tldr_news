 TESLA SHAREHOLDERS VOTE TO REINSTATE ELON MUSK'S $56 BILLION PAY
PACKAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article provides a summary of what was discussed at Tesla's
annual meeting. Tesla shareholders have voted to ratify CEO Elon
Musk's $56 billion pay package. While the vote doesn't override an
earlier court ruling that ordered Tesla to rescind the package, it
provides a public relations victory for Musk and could help him sway a
court to give him the performance options in the future. Shareholders
also voted to move Tesla's site of incorporation out of Delaware and
into Texas. 

 HOW AMAZON BLEW ALEXA'S SHOT TO DOMINATE AI, ACCORDING TO MORE THAN A
DOZEN EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED ON IT (25 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Amazon demoed a generative AI-powered Alexa in September last year.
There has been little news about the project since, besides some
reports about a potential launch later this year. Shipment of the new
Alexa is being delayed due to structure dysfunction and technology
challenges within Amazon. Former Amazon employees say that the company
is desperately behind its Big Tech rivals in the race to launch AI
chatbots and agents. The new Alexa is reportedly still not ready for a
prime time rollout and Amazon does not have enough data or access to
the specialized chips needed to run large language models to compete.
Amazon so far has been unable to capitalize on its partnership with
Anthropic to build a better Alexa.

 WANT TO MAKE ROBOTS MORE AGILE? TAKE A LESSON FROM A RAT (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A group of researchers have collaborated with scientists at Google's
DeepMind AI lab to build a biomechanically realistic digital model of
a rat. They trained an artificial neural network to control a virtual
body in a physics simulator using high-resolution data recorded from
real rats. This resulted in a virtual rat with an artificial brain
that can move around virtual environments like a real rodent. The
research could provide convenient and fully transparent models for
studying neural circuits and see how such circuits are compromised in
disease. 

 AI WILL BECOME MATHEMATICIANS' ‚ÄòCO-PILOT' (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Computers can help solve the big, unsolved problems in mathematics.
The latest advancements in artificial intelligence introduce
completely new ways of working and open up new possibilities for
cooperation in mathematics. This article contains a transcript of an
interview with Terence Tao from the University of California in which
he discusses the future of the field of mathematics. Tao also covers
collaboration in the field, automated proof checking, new
technologies, the big unanswered problems in mathematics, and more.

 SMART PASTE FOR CONTEXT-AWARE ADJUSTMENTS TO PASTED CODE (13 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Smart Paste is a tool broadly available at Google that predicts the
next state of a code environment and uses generative AI to create
context-aware adjustments to pasted code. It streamlines the process
of copy-pasting during code revisions. When testing the tool with
around 40,000 engineers, Google found that 6.9% of all pastes in the
IDE utilized Smart Paste - 42.5% of suggestions from the feature were
accepted. This article discusses how Google developed the feature. 

 UNCENSOR ANY LLM WITH ABLITERATION (23 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Abliteration is a technique that uncensors any large language model
without retraining. It effectively removes the model's built-in
refusal mechanism, allowing it to respond to all types of prompts.
Large language models that are fine-tuned for safety and
instruction-following have a stream that moderates the model's ability
to refuse requests. Preventing models from representing this direction
makes the model lose its ability to refuse requests. Adding to the
direction artificially can cause models to refuse even harmless
requests. This article discusses the abliteration technique and walks
readers through how to implement it.

 HOW TO DO THE JHANAS (31 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The jhanas are a series of altered mental states induced via
sustained concentration without any external stimuli or substances.
These states vary in intensity, with some comparable to drug-induced
states. Practicing the jhanas can be a good way to cultivate
attention. This guide teaches readers how to enter these states.
Anyone can access the jhanas regardless of their meditation
experience. 

 INTRODUCING DREAM MACHINE (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Dream Machine is a next generation video model from Luma AI. It can
create high quality, realistic shots from text instructions and
images. Dream Machine is available to everyone for free. Examples of
videos generated with Dream Machine along with a link to try the model
are available.
