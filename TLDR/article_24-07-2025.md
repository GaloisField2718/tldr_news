 😘 KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's AI-native service SUPPORTS MOBILE AND WEB APPS, delivering
80% automated test coverage in weeks [5] and helping engineering teams
SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles to less than 15 minutes.

With QA Wolf, [6] you get:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs for mobile and web apps
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes guarantee

The result? Drata [7] achieved 4X MORE TEST CASES and 86% FASTER QA
CYCLES.

 TESLA CLAIMS IT PRODUCED THE FIRST BUILDS OF ITS ‘NEW AFFORDABLE'
ELECTRIC CAR MODELS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Tesla claims to have produced the first builds of its new, more
affordable electric car models in June. Volume production has been
planned for the second half of the year. Plans for a 2025 launch
remain on track. The vehicle is expected to be a 'stripped-down' Model
Y with fewer materials, fewer features, and possibly a slightly
smaller size. 

 SPACEX'S CELLULAR STARLINK LAUNCHES TODAY VIA T-MOBILE: WHAT YOU NEED
TO KNOW (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 T-Mobile and SpaceX's T-Satellite service is now available to
subscribers, allowing smartphone users to remain connected even in
deadzones. Existing T-Mobile customers can purchase the cellular
Starlink service as an add-on - those on pricier plans like Experience
Beyond and Go5G Next get it as a free perk. People on other networks
can also subscribe through a secondary eSIM. Those who participated in
the free trial should now expect to be charged for the service.

 META UNVEILS WRISTBAND FOR CONTROLLING COMPUTERS WITH HAND GESTURES
(7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Meta's wristband reads the electrical signals that pulse through the
muscles when people move their fingers. It uses a technique called
electromyography to gather electrical signals from muscles in the
forearm. These signals can reveal what people are about to do even
before they do it. With enough practice, people using the wristband
can control devices simply by producing the right thought. 

 NEURALINK SEES $1 BILLION OF REVENUE BY 2031 IN VAST EXPANSION (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Neuralink expects to put its chips in 20,000 people a year and
generate at least $1 billion in annual revenue by 2031. It plans to
have about five large clinics in operation and at least three versions
of its device available. The company's figures assume a conservative
reimbursement of $50,000 per surgery. Several other brain companies
are building and testing similar devices. No brain-computer interfaces
have yet been commercially approved for permanent implantation by the
US FDA - Neuralink expects to gain regulatory approval in the US for
its first device by 2029.

 DOCS FOR AI AGENTS (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Agent docs are a way to get better results from agents. They make
agent output more consistent, more aligned with codebase conventions,
and more accurate. This post discusses how to implement agent docs
into a project. It covers how agent docs are different from internal
eng docs, best practices for AI docs, and reasons why agent and eng
docs should be kept separate. 

 A VALID HTML ZIP BOMB (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 One way to deal with aggressive web crawlers that don't respect
robots.txt is to exhaust their resources. This post goes through how
to build a valid HTML zip bomb that exhausts bots' RAM. The
implementation technique exploits the asymmetry of the resources
needed to serve the zip bomb versus those needed to detect it. Bots
that respect robots.txt won't be affected by the zip bomb as the path
to the zip bomb is forbidden in the specification.

 WHY AMAZON WANTS AN AI BRACELET THAT RECORDS EVERYTHING YOU SAY (5
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Bee's wearable bracelet transcribes users' conversations and then
uses artificial intelligence to turn that data into searchable
history. The company's chief executive recently announced that Bee is
joining Amazon in a yet-to-be-signed deal. The data that such a device
could gather could help Amazon build more advanced AI models. Amazon
hasn't provided any official details on its motivations for acquiring
the company. 

 JEFF BEZOS WEIGHING POSSIBLE ACQUISITION OF CNBC CABLE NETWORK (4
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Jeff Bezos has signaled his interest in buying CNBC. The network
would serve as a credible 'neural voice' in his media portfolio. Bezos
also owns the left-leaning Washington Post. Comcast plans to spin off
its struggling cable assets by the end of the year. CNBC will become
part of a publicly-traded company called Versant - there will be a
two-year period where Versant will not be able to sell major assets
without major tax implications.
