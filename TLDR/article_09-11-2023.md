 10 HARD-TO-SWALLOW TRUTHS THEY WON'T TELL YOU ABOUT SOFTWARE ENGINEER
JOB (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Many people enter the software engineering role because they see good
pay, remote work, team building, and pizza parties - no one is telling
them about the real things that software engineers actually do. This
article aims to give those planning to enter the industry a dose of
reality about the role. Some of the hard truths it covers include the
fact that college doesn't prepare you for the job, developers rarely
get greenfield projects, no one cares about clean code, and you will

 RULE AMBIGUITY, INSTITUTIONAL CLASHES, AND POPULATION LOSS: HOW
WIKIPEDIA BECAME THE LAST GOOD PLACE ON THE INTERNET (65 MINUTE READ)

who are unhappy with the institution leave while those who benefit
from it remain. This form of endogenous change happened with the

controversial content left or were removed, leading to significant
institutional change. 

 MOST VIDEO GAME ARTWORK WILL NEVER BE SEEN (28 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Artists do some of the most important work in video games - but most
of the art they create is never seen. There is much more that goes
into game development than the polished pieces we see. Many artists
have large holes in their portfolios due to rules governing the
crediting and ownership of the works they create. This article looks
at the imbalance in power between game studios and their artists to
understand why so much work is hidden and how this could change in the
future.
