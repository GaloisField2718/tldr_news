 PARADIGM REDEFINED: HEAD, WORLD FIRST AI MARKETER, A NEW SPECIES
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Head, the world's first true AI Marketer [4], isn't merely an
advanced tool; it manifests as an emergent AI species. Its
architecture is characterized by profound, self-directed learning and
continuous adaptive evolution, enabling it to self-directedly devise
and execute complex marketing strategies [4] – from ideation to
nuanced creative outputs – with precision surpassing existing human
and algorithmic benchmarks. Significantly, while the capacity for AI
empathy is often debated (ref. Sam Altman), Head's deep brand-audience
synthesis capabilities compel a critical re-evaluation of such
limitations. This represents a new frontier in applied AI,
fundamentally redefining marketing efficacy.

 GOOGLE I/O 2025: ALL THE NEWS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS (20 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google I/O 2025 included announcements about putting more AI into
Search, Gmail, and Chrome, AI model updates, and plans to revamp video
calls, make a more aware and conversational assistant, and partner
with traditional glasses companies on smart glasses. This page
contains all of the news and announcements from the event. Highlights
included Google's 'universal AI assistant' prototype, real-time AI
camera sharing in Search, a new way to hold virtual meetings, and
Gmail smart replies. The keynote lacked a big Android presence, but
Google had already made plenty of Android OS announcements last week. 

 APPLE TO LET DEVELOPERS BUILD WITH ITS AI MODELS STARTING AT WWDC
2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple plans to open its Apple Intelligence AI models to third-party
developers with a new software development kit (SDK). The SDK will
give developers access to smaller on-device versions of Apple's AI
models, but not the cloud-based models running on Apple's servers.
Apple may be looking to mirror the early success of the App Store by
making it easy for developers to use its new capabilities. This could
result in a large base of innovative AI-powered experiences exclusive
to its platforms.

 SURGEONS IN CALIFORNIA PERFORM FIRST EVER SUCCESSFUL BLADDER
TRANSPLANT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Surgeons in California have performed a successful bladder transplant
on a patient who previously had his bladder and both kidneys removed
as a result of cancer treatment and end-stage kidney disease. The
treatment allowed the patient to go off dialysis. While the surgery
comes with considerable short- and long-term risks and unknowns, it is
a historic moment in medicine that could impact how patients with
highly symptomatic 'terminal' bladders that are no longer functioning
are managed. 

 HOW 3D PRINTING IS PERSONALIZING HEALTH CARE (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 3D printing is shifting the healthcare field from mass-produced
solutions to customized treatments tailored to each patient's needs.
The rapidly evolving technology provides new options for prosthetics,
implants, surgical planning, drug manufacturing, and many other health
care needs. 3D printing is able to create precisely shaped objects in
a wide range of materials, leading to many advanced treatments. This
article looks at the many different ways the technology is being
applied to medicine.

 AI, LLMS, AND OBSERVABILITY: 7 KEY INSIGHTS FROM GOOGLE'S DIRECTOR OF
AI AND DATADOG'S VP OF ENGINEERING (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Google's Director of AI Dr. Ali Arsanjani, and Datadog's VP of
Engineering Sajid Mehmood, sat down to discuss the current and future
states of AI, ML, and LLMs on Google Cloud. This guide distills the
top 7 insights and actions for technical leaders [9], covering
everything from upskilling teams to observability best practices. Read
it here [9] 

 THE CODEX OF ULTIMATE VIBING (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's Codex is a software engineering agent that runs in the cloud
and does tasks like writing new features or fixing bugs. It can run
many tasks in parallel. All code is provided via GitHub repositories,
and all Codex executions are sandboxed in the cloud. While it can't
access the web, it can install dependencies before it starts. It will
take some time before Codex can be properly evaluated, as it is
currently only available to those paying $200/month, but reviews so
far seem positive and many people report being impressed with it. 

 JUVIO (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Juvio is a UV kernel for Jupyter that can create reproducible,
dependency-aware, and git-friendly Jupyter Notebooks. It installs
packages right from the notebook and saves dependencies directly in
the notebook as metadata. Juvio automatically installs dependencies
when the notebook is opened in an ephemeral virtual environment,
ensuring that notebooks run with the correct version of the packages
and Python. Notebooks are converted to a format that makes diffs and
version control painless.

 WHY SUBSTACK WILL BE THE INTELLECTUAL ENGINE OF THE 21ST CENTURY (18
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 One of the prerequisites for bringing about the civilizational-scale
change during the Enlightenment was a series of technological
innovations that dramatically improved communications among the
intellectual elites. The Enlightenment saw the widespread printing of
secular books, the spread of newspapers, and the build-out of public
postal systems - innovations that allowed people to send letters to
each other, read each other's books, and keep up to date with news
happening in other countries. Communication tools like Substack allow
people to engage in the work of ideating and iterating ways to solve
challenges and build society. These tools are more accessible than
ever and allow us to hear from a wide range of people. 

 THE GEMINIFICATION OF CHROME (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google is bringing Gemini and Gemini Live to Chrome for Mac and
Windows. The integration will initially let users ask questions about
pages - future versions will be able to navigate the web and take
actions on users' behalf. Google is currently in the middle of the
remedy phase of an antitrust trial that it lost, and one of the things
the Justice Department wants to take from the company is Chrome. The
integration may shift Chrome from a piece of older technology to a
vessel ready to carry Google to dominance in AI. This may raise
complaints from startups like Perplexity and The Browser Company,
which are both on the verge of launching new AI browsers, and cause
more issues with Google's case.

 ASK HN: WHEN WILL MANAGERS BE REPLACED BY AI? (HACKER NEWS THREAD)

 AI excels at a lot of tasks that managers do, but there may be legal
and other risks with using AI that might not be worth the cost
savings.
