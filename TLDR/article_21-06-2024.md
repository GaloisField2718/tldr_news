 ANTHROPIC HAS A FAST NEW AI MODEL ‚Äî AND A CLEVER NEW WAY TO
INTERACT WITH CHATBOTS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic's newest model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is reportedly equal to
or better than OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini across a wide
variety of tasks. The model performs well in benchmarks, suggesting
that Anthropic has built a legitimate competitor in the space. Claude
3.5 Sonnet is available now to web and iOS users and will be available
to developers as well. Anthropic is introducing a new feature called
Artifacts that will allow users to see, interact with, and edit the
results of their Claude requests. 

 DELL SAID RETURN TO THE OFFICE OR ELSE‚ÄîNEARLY HALF OF WORKERS CHOSE
‚ÄúOR ELSE‚Äù (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Dell announced a return-to-office initiative earlier this year that
involved workers having to classify themselves as remote or hybrid.
Those who chose to classify themselves as remote had to agree that
they could no longer be promoted or hired into new roles within the
company. Nearly 50% of Dell's workforce opted to stay remote. Many
interviewed employees admitted that they were looking for work at
other companies that weren't trying to force employees back to the
office. Many other companies are struggling to restore in-person work.

 WHY AMERICANS AREN'T BUYING MORE EVS (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Electric vehicles are still too expensive to be accessible to
millions of Americans. High prices, high interest rates, and concerns
over driving range and charging infrastructure have chilled buyers'
enthusiasm, even among those who consider themselves green. The US
government has set policies that hit Chinese manufacturers of cars,
batteries, and other components with punitive taxes. It also restricts
federal tax incentives for consumers buying Chinese products. While
the laws aim to allow the US to develop its own supply chains,
analysts say such protectionism will result in higher EV prices for US
consumers in the meantime and slow down EV adoption in the US. 

 ASK HN: COULD AI BE A DOT COM SIZED BUBBLE? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [15]


 While generative AI will likely be incredibly important in the
future, there seems to be a lot of high expectations of how useful it
can be in the near future, and ideas around business models are fuzzy
like in the dot com era. If these near-future expectations don't pan
out, companies could slow down their R&D expenditures, leading to a
sizable stock market correction. There are clear differences between
AI and the dot com bubble, so the comparison doesn't exactly hold.
