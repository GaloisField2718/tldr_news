 DEEPSEEK FAQ (37 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DeepSeek's R1 model, which is similar to OpenAI's o1, caused a
meltdown in the tech industry over the weekend. Many of the
revelations that contributed to the meltdown were included in
DeepSeek's announcement over Christmas and most of the breakthroughs
in V3 were actually revealed with the release of the V2 model last
January. DeepSeek-V2 introduced two important breakthroughs,
DeepSeekMoE and DeepSeekMLA - the implications of these breakthroughs
only became apparent with V3, which added a new approach to load
balancing and multi-token prediction in training. The cost of training
the model amounted to only $5.576 million, but that excludes the costs
associated with prior research, experiments, and data. Many of the
decisions DeepSeek made in training its model were due to the
constraints of the chip ban - if DeepSeek had access to more powerful
chips, it probably would have used a different method. 

 IPHONE SE 4 APPEARS IN NEW PHOTOS AND VIDEO, NOTCH AND ALL (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A leaker shared a short video of the new iPhone SE over the weekend.
Unlike previous models, the device appears to only have a single rear
camera. It is the first iPhone SE model to feature a USB-C port. The
device uses Apple's older notched display rather than the Dynamic
Island design. Rumors point to a launch around March or April. The
video is available in the article.

 HUGE STUDY FINDS CONSTELLATION OF HEALTH BENEFITS FOR OZEMPIC BEYOND
WEIGHT LOSS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new study that tracked millions of diabetes patient outcomes over a
period of 3.5 years found that those on GLP-1 medications saw
significant improvements across a staggering range of health concerns,
far beyond anything clearly linked to weight or blood sugar. The
patients experienced improvements in addiction and psychotic disorders
and the risk of Alzheimer's was decreased. GLP-1RA drugs act on
receptors that are expressed in brain areas involved in impulse
control, reward, and addiction, which may potentially explain their
effectiveness in curbing appetite and addiction disorders. While the
findings are positive, the researchers found some issues that seemed
to be exacerbated by taking GLP-1s, including an increase in risk for
arthritis and pancreatitis. 

 WITH SUCCESSFUL NEW GLENN FLIGHT, BLUE ORIGIN MAY FINALLY BE TURNING
THE CORNER (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Blue Origin is finally a real rocket company with the successful
launch of New Glenn. The company's next steps will be to get better at
building engines and rockets and flying New Glenn regularly. Its
current priorities are rate manufacturing and driving urgency around
building the 'machine that builds the machine'. Blue Origin is the
world's largest single-donor nonprofit, so it has zero incentive to
operate like SpaceX.

 MICROSOFT BUILDS OPEN SOURCE DOCUMENT DATABASE ON POSTGRESQL,
SUGGESTS FERRETDB AS FRONT END (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Developers looking to build something new on a document database now
have more alternatives to choose from. Microsoft has launched a
document database platform constructed on a relational PostgreSQL back
end. It has suggested that users kick things off by implementing a
FerretDB solution on the platform to get started. Microsoft has been
increasingly accepting of the open source world. The joint development
between Microsoft, PostgreSQL, and FerretDB is a threat to
source-available MongoDB and Couchbase. 

 MY FAILED ATTEMPT TO SHRINK ALL NPM PACKAGES BY 5% (12 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Developer Evan Hahn proposed an idea in 2022 that could decrease the
size of all newly-published npm packages by about 5%. Despite it being
completely backwards compatible, improving performance, and reducing
storage costs, the npm maintainers rejected the proposal. Hahn had
thought the idea was great until he received feedback - implementing
his idea would be difficult and would make publishing much slower. The
changes would also not retroactively apply to existing packages. After
receiving feedback and thinking about the tradeoffs, Hahn felt that
the idea wasn't worth it and closed the proposal.

 META IS REPORTEDLY SCRAMBLING ‘WAR ROOMS' OF ENGINEERS TO FIGURE
OUT HOW DEEPSEEK'S AI IS BEATING EVERYONE ELSE AT A FRACTION OF THE
PRICE (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Meta's Mark Zuckerberg responded to the release of DeepSeek R1 by
assembling four war rooms of engineers to figure out how the Chinese
hedge fund built the AI. DeepSeek's model may potentially outperform
the next version of Meta's Llama AI due to be released in early 2025.
Meta is working on deciphering how DeepSeek lowered the cost of
training and running its model, finding out what data the Chinese lab
used to train its model, and how Meta can restructure its models based
on the attributes of the DeepSeek models. Zuckerberg recently
announced that Meta would spend as much as $65 billion on AI-related
projects in the coming year, just days after OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle,
and others announced a $500 billion White-house backed AI
infrastructure project. 

 NVIDIA SHEDS ALMOST $600 BILLION IN MARKET CAP, BIGGEST ONE-DAY LOSS
IN U.S. HISTORY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Nvidia experienced the biggest market cap drop for any company on a
single day in US history on Monday when it lost close to $600 billion
in market cap. Its stock price plummeted 17% and caused a 3.1% slide
in the tech-heavy NASDAQ. The sell-off was sparked by DeepSeek
presenting increased competition in the global AI industry. The
Chinese AI lab released a free and open source large language model
that only took two months and less than $6 million to build using
Nvidia H800s. The release has caused investors to rethink spending on
compute.
