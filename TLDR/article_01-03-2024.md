 OPENAI WANTS TO MAKE A WALKING, TALKING HUMANOID ROBOT SMARTER (9
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Humanoid robots could be working alongside human manufacturing
workers in only a few short years. Figure, a prominent company in the
humanoid robot space, recently raised $675 million and struck a new
agreement with OpenAI to develop next-generation AI models for its
robots. The funding, which was reportedly over $150 million more than
the amount Figure had initially sought, will help scale up the
company's AI training, robotic manufacturing, and add on new
engineers, speeding up the company's timeline for making its product
available commercially. OpenAI's technology will help improve Figure's
robots' semantic understanding, making them more useful in work
scenarios. 

 TESLA STANDS TO EARN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR BY OPENING U.S.
CHARGING STATIONS TO DRIVERS OF FORD AND OTHER EVS (4 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Ford electric vehicles can now recharge at Tesla Superchargers. Tesla
operates about one in three charging stations in the US. The expanded
charging business could bring in an estimated $6 billion to $12
billion a year to Tesla by 2030. Allowing other automakers to tap into
its charging network opens Tesla up to receiving federal funding.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 ASTRO MECHANICA HAS INVENTED A NEW KIND OF JET ENGINE (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Astro Mechanica's new jet engine is efficient at every speed. It uses
electric motors to drive a compressor, allowing it to spin at any
speed. The jet engine could be used in the first stage of an orbital
vehicle to get payloads to orbit dramatically cheaper than other
all-rocket systems. A video of a demonstration from last year is
available in the thread - Astro Mechanica is already working on a new
engine with 10x the thrust. 

 HIGH-SPEED HUMANOID FEELS LIKE A STEP CHANGE IN ROBOTICS (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Sanctuary AI's Phoenix humanoid robot has robot hands that work
totally autonomously at near-human speeds. The robot's hands are
hydraulically actuated - while hydraulics technology is expensive to
develop, it enables the robotic hands to gain a combination of
precision, speed, and strength. Sanctuary AI trained Phoenix by using
teleoperation to show it how to do things and then letting it figure
out more in simulations. A video showing Phoenix manipulating objects
is available in the article.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 IN PRAISE OF NUSHELL (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Nushell is a non-POSIX shell for working with structured data. It
features redefined common shell commands that output structured data.
Nushell's commands and pipes allow users to transform data from within
the shell. It is able to replace many database query tools. 

 VERSIONFOX (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 VersionFox is an extendable cross-platform tool for managing SDK
versions. It allows users to quickly install and switch between
different versions of SDKs using the command line. VersionFox supports
Global, Project, and Session scopes when switching versions. It has a
simple plugin system for adding language support.

 ASK HN: DID YOU ENCOUNTER ANY LEAP YEAR BUGS TODAY? (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [11] 

 An extra day in the year can have interesting consequences. This
Hacker News thread discusses bugs that users observed on February 29.
Bugs were seen in card payment systems, parcel delivery websites, and
daily post bots. China's app for scheduling marriage certificates
apparently has a leap-year bug that prevents people born on February
29 from making appointments as it marks them as too young to marry
legally. 

 CAN WE GET MORE DECENTRALISED THAN THE FEDIVERSE? (13 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 The fediverse will likely become as decentralized as email: a bit,
but not that much. Personal instances will be pretty rare. This
article explains why the fediverse won't be distributed and examines
ideas for a distributed social system. It may be possible to get more
decentralized than the fediverse using a simple extension on RSS,
which can already incorporate a lot of popular content. Compared to
the fediverse, RSS has a lower barrier to entry and cleaner separation
of concerns and responsibilities.

 MONEY BUBBLE (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI/ML will eventually be able to do some useful things, maybe even a
lot of useful things, but it likely won't generate the kind of profit
explosions required to justify the current bubble. 

 STACK OVERFLOW OPENS API TO GOOGLE‚ÄôS GEMINI (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Overflow API will be previewed at Google's upcoming Cloud Next
conference in April and made available within the first half of 2024.

 Implementing AWS Sigv4 as a middleware allows developers to emulate
AWS APIs and AWS-compatible services. 

 ROCKETLAB SAYS ITS SPACEX COMPETITOR ROCKET WILL FLY IN DECEMBER (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 While RocketLab's executives are optimistic about the self-imposed
deadline, federal officials think the company will not be ready in
time.
