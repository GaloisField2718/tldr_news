 TESLA IS OFFICIALLY LOSING HALF $7,500 TAX CREDIT ON TWO MODEL 3
TRIMS (3 MINUTE READ) [6]

vehicles to deliver on its annual guidance.

 WHEN PRODUCT MARKETS BECOME COLLECTIVE TRAPS: THE CASE OF SOCIAL
MEDIA (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Many people use social media out of a fear of missing out rather than

challenges the argument that the mere existence of a product implies
positive welfare for its users. The results suggest a heightened need
for regulators to assess whether different products create traps for
consumers and whether they generate positive welfare.
