 HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR HYDRATION FOR PEAK PRODUCTIVITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 As techies, we love optimizing stuff. Ever thought of optimizing your
hydration?

Turns out, the key to unlocking peak mental performance is
electrolytes ‚Äî not chugging more water or caffeine. In fact,
overhydrating can cause brain fog and fatigue by diluting blood sodium
levels.

Enter LMNT [5] ‚Äî a zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix [4] was created
by a former research biochemist to deliver the optimal ratio of
sodium, potassium and magnesium.

Engineers and CTOs use LMNT to power through long coding sessions,
stay in a flow state [4], and boost mental clarity. And with no
artificial ingredients or dodgy chemicals, LMNT is the clean way to
stay productive for longer.

 YOUTUBE LOOKS TO BE TESTING SERVER-SIDE AD INJECTION TO COUNTER AD
BLOCKERS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 YouTube is currently experimenting with server-side ad injection. It
is making ads part of the video being streamed instead of delivering
them separately, resulting in them being indistinguishable from
videos. The implementation breaks extensions like SponsorBlock, which
depend on timestamps to mark video sections. Server-side ad injection
is still in testing and not yet widely rolled out. 

 SAM ALTMAN SAYS OPENAI COULD BECOME A FOR-PROFIT MEANING IT COULD
EVENTUALLY IPO (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sam Altman is reportedly considering making OpenAI a for-profit
company that the current non-profit board wouldn't control. One
possible option being considered is making the company a for-profit
benefit corporation. This would mean the company will have to consider
its impact on society and the environment and balance the interests of
its shareholders with the interests of employees, customers, the
community, and the environment. Becoming a for-profit could open up
the path to an initial public offering that would give the public a
chance to own its shares.

 SPACEX'S FIFTH STARSHIP TEST FLIGHT TIMELINE REVEALED BY MUSK (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SpaceX aims to fly its full stack Starship rocket for the fifth time
in late July. The rocket was able to make a successful soft splashdown
during its fourth test, giving the company the confidence to try a
tower catch for the fifth test. Another area SpaceX will be testing is
the second stage ship's heat shield, which is made of thousands of
tiles. Many of the tiles fell off in the previous test even when the
ship was on the ground. 

 ‚ÄòSON OF CONCORDE' COMPANY'S SUPERFACTORY WILL PRODUCE 33 SUPERSONIC
AIRCRAFT A YEAR (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Boom Supersonic's Overture airliner can reach New York from London in
just 3.5 hours. The company's superfactory is set to be finished by
the end of the year. Boom is aiming to produce 66 supersonic aircraft
every year and totally revolutionize air travel. It plans to start
carrying passengers by 2029. The Overture will carry up to 80
passengers at a cruising speed of Mach 1.7 up to a range of 4,250
nautical miles.

 NVIDIA WARP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 NVIDIA Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance
simulation and graphics code. It takes regular Python functions and
JIT compiles them to efficient kernel code that can run on the CPU or
GPU. Warp comes with a rich set of primitives that make it easy to
write programs for physics simulation, perception, robotics, and
geometry processing. Its kernels can be used as part of machine
learning pipelines with frameworks such as PyTorch and JAX. 

 GPT-2 FROM SCRATCH IN MLX (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This repository contains a Python script that defines and trains
GPT-2 from scratch. The model is trained on around 1 million
characters from Shakespeare. It can be trained in around 10 minutes on
a MacBook to produce coherent Shakespeare-like text. The script only
uses MLX and NumPy as dependencies.

 APPLE ANNOUNCED RCS WITH A WHIMPER WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BANG (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Apple skipped over RCS during its keynote, making it seem like the
company didn't think it was worthy enough to show off. RCS
implementation in iOS is a massive improvement for both Android and
iPhone users. Both platforms will now be able to exchange
high-resolution media with each other without having to download a
third-party messenger. 

 THE BIG LOSER IN TESLA'S SHAREHOLDER VOTE IS DELAWARE (5 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Tesla's reincorporation in Texas is an attempt by Elon Musk to loosen
Delaware's grip on US corporations. Around two-thirds of S&P 500
companies are incorporated in Delaware. The state has specialized
courts that handle business matters with stacks of legal precedents to
address disputes. Texas offers lower taxes and a newer and less
predictable business court system. The move will save Tesla about
$250,000 a year in tax payments.
