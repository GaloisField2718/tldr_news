 APPLE SHELVES VISION HEADSET REVAMP TO PRIORITIZE META-LIKE AI
GLASSES (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple will forego its planned overhaul of its Vision Pro headset to
redirect resources towards developing smart glasses that can rival
products from Meta. The company had been preparing a cheaper, lighter
variant of its headset for release in 2027. Smart glasses have emerged
as a critical arena for tech companies. Future designs could
eventually challenge smartphones as a must-have technology, and Apple
wants to be ready. 

 AMAZON LAUNCHES ‘PRICE-CONSCIOUS' GROCERY BRAND WITH MOST PRODUCTS
UNDER $5 (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Amazon Grocery is a new brand aimed at 'price-conscious' shoppers.
Most of the products in the store's more than 1,000 items will be
priced under $5. The new offering unites Amazon's Happy Belly and
Amazon Fresh brands under one label. Amazon last month expanded
same-day delivery of fresh foods to more pockets of the US.

 MEET THE ARC SPACECRAFT: IT AIMS TO DELIVER CARGO ANYWHERE IN THE
WORLD IN AN HOUR (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Inversion's Arc spacecraft is designed to deliver as much as 500
pounds almost anywhere in the world, almost instantaneously. The
company envisions pre-positioning Arcs in orbit and having them stay
up for up to five years, autonomously going and landing wherever and
whenever they're needed. Inversion is aiming to launch the first Arc
vehicle by the end of next year. The company has already built a
full-scale manufacturing development unit of the primary structure for
the first Arc vehicle. 

 THIS WINDOWLESS PLANE IS VYING TO BE THE PRIVATE JET OF THE FUTURE (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Otto Aerospace has a new business jet with no traditional passenger
windows. Flexjet has signed a contract to buy 300 of the Phantom 3500
aircraft. The aircraft seats nine passengers in a tear-drop-shaped
cabin lined with digital panes that display a virtual view of the
outdoors. The plane's design helps cut fuel burn by 60% compared with
other jets of similar size. The aircraft is still in development, with
its first flight targeted for 2027.

 DECODING NETFLIX'S AV1 STREAMS: HERE ARE 10 THINGS I FOUND (13 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 AV1 is not just another spec sheet with theoretical gains. It
delivers on its promises with staggering results in real-world
streams. The format is smarter in quiet moments and more composed
during action scenes, and its efficiency advantage often accelerates
the harder it is pushed. It is now just a matter of time before AV1
dominates streaming. 

 DEVELOPMENT GETS BETTER WITH AGE (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Older developers aren't worried about the barrage of new model
announcements and feature releases - they've seen it before. AI might
be new tech, but it follows the same patterns. While many people are
experiencing a fear of missing out on AI, the older developer knows
this is the time to press the pause button. It is important to have
in-depth conversations with stakeholders to understand the problems to
solve. Sometimes, the solution will be generative AI.

 INDIVIDUALS MATTER (24 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Organizations like to move people around projects every few months to
help teams understand what other teams are doing, but this rarely
works. Roadmaps maintain the fiction that people are interchangeable,
but everyone knows this isn't true. An effective team is difficult to
create due to the institutional knowledge that exists on a team, as
well as the team's culture - but destroying a team is very easy. Many
people in senior management roles seem to think they can redirect
people as easily as in a video game, assigning workers to switch from
one task to another, but often, these moves won't work out. 

 ALL ATOM VIRTUAL CELL (13 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 An AI virtual cell that can re-create and simulate the behavior of
molecules, cells, and tissues across diverse states would require an
enormous amount of data to train, and it still might not be very
predictive. Many groups have been trying to make predictive models of
cell morphology and gene expression under chemical perturbation for
years, but while the models are good, they haven't fundamentally
changed how biology is done. A simulation of an entire human cell,
atom by atom, running for 24 hours with molecular dynamics would take
an estimated 2 x 10^38 FLOPs and 200 TW of electricity. It may be
possible for humans to create one in 2074.
