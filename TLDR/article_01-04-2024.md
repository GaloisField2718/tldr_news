 OPENAI‚ÄôS VOICE CLONING AI MODEL ONLY NEEDS A 15-SECOND SAMPLE TO
WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's Voice Engine can create synthetic voices based on a
15-second clip of someone's voice. The text-to-voice generation
platform is currently in limited access. Developers testing the
platform are required to get explicit and informed consent from
speakers, not build ways for individual users to create their own
voices, and disclose to listeners that the voices are AI-generated.
Example clips generated by Voice Engine are available in the article. 

 MICROSOFT REPORTEDLY BUILDING ‚ÄòSTARGATE' TO TRANSPORT OPENAI INTO
THE FUTURE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft is planning to build a $100 billion supercomputer called
Stargate to power OpenAI's next generation of artificial intelligence
systems. Stargate could take up several hundred acres of land and
require up to 5 gigawatts of power. The facility could open as soon as
2028. Its creation is largely dependent on whether OpenAI can deliver
its next major AI upgrade, which is reportedly due in early 2025.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SOUTH KOREAN ‚ÄòARTIFICIAL SUN‚Äô REACHES 7 TIMES THE SUN‚ÄôS CORE
TEMPERATURE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Korea Institute of Fusion Energy‚Äôs (KFE) Korea Superconducting
Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) fusion reactor has reached
temperatures seven times that of the Sun‚Äôs core. The researchers
managed to maintain temperatures of 212 degrees Fahrenheit for 48
seconds. They also maintained the reactor's high confinement mode for
over 100 seconds. Creating technology that can maintain
high-temperature and high-density plasmas for extended periods is
crucial for fusion. 

 SCIENTISTS PUT TARDIGRADE PROTEINS INTO HUMAN CELLS. HERE'S WHAT
HAPPENED (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tardigrades have an incredible ability to stay alive in extreme
environments. Researchers from the University of Wyoming found that
expressing key tardigrade proteins in human cells slowed metabolism.
The research could eventually lead to treatments for slowing down
aging or safe cell storage at cold temperatures. There is other
research underway looking at whether tardigrade proteins can stabilize
important blood products used to treat genetic diseases.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 LINUX COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT DOWN BY BACKDOOR FOUND IN WIDELY USED
UTILITY (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A supply-chain attack involving obfuscated malicious code in the xz
package was discovered by a developer at Microsoft who noticed a small
600ms delay with SSH processes when doing some routine
micro-benchmarking. The account that made the offending commits
seemingly played the long game, slowly gaining the trust of xz's
developer before injecting the attack. The attack allows for the
interception and modification of data used with the library, allowing
malicious actors to break sshd authentication and gain access to
affected systems. The situation is developing and more vulnerabilities
could be discovered. 

 DESIGN ENGINEERING (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article talks about what Design Engineering is and discusses the
future of the field. Design Engineers have become a popular role in
software. The role tends to entail work on products and systems that
involves adapting and using complex scientific and mathematical
techniques, working on high technical challenges that require strong
design consideration. It is not simply a rebrand of product design.

 HOW STABILITY AI‚ÄôS FOUNDER TANKED HIS BILLION-DOLLAR STARTUP (27
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stability AI has been running out of money for months and its
founder, Emad Mostaque, had been unable to secure enough additional
funding. When Mostaque took the stage at the Terranea Resort two weeks
ago, the company had defaulted on payments to Amazon and several key
staff had resigned or were threatening to resign. Mostaque himself
resigned four days later, after fighting to maintain his position and
control despite mounting internal and external pressure to step down.
This article tells the story in detail, from Stability AI's beginnings
to its current problems and what's in store for the company next. 

 AVOID BLUNDERING: 80% OF A WINNING STRATEGY (19 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Most of winning comes from not making mistakes. Identifying blunders
and true causes for failure can help a lot in avoiding repeating them
in the future. This article looks at different types of blunders in
the startup space and how to prevent them or mitigate their effects.
Preventable blunders include not talking to customers, choosing the
wrong market, and not selecting a target audience. One interesting
thing to note is that bad ideas, lack of ability to make a product,
the number of co-funders, and location aren't common factors that kill
startups.
