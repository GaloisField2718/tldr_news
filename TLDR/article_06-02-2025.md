 IF YOU'RE JUST USING LOOM FOR SCREEN RECORDING, YOU'RE MISSING OUT.
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Here's 4 ways you can use Atlassian's Loom to spend less time meeting
and more time coding:

‚Üí ADD VISUAL CONTEXT TO CODE OR PRODUCT DEMOS, including easy
drawing and editing tools.

‚Üí CREATE BUG REPORTS WITH JUST A VIDEO: Loom AI [5] will populate
the Jira or Linear ticket for you.

‚Üí RECORD, SHARE, AND EMBED VIDEOS in the tools you use every day:
Jira, Linear, GitHub, and more.

‚Üí REVIEW CODE OR REPLICATE BUGS without interrupting anyone's flow.

And yes: it's the best and easiest-to-use screen recorder [5] out
there, used by >25 million people across 400,000 companies.

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES NEW AI MODELS AND BRINGS ‚ÄòTHINKING' TO GEMINI (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google launched Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental and made Gemini 2.0 Flash
Thinking, its reasoning model, available on the Gemini app on
Wednesday. Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental will be available on Google's
AI development platforms, Vertex AI and Google AI Studio, and to
Gemini Advanced subscribers in the Gemini app. The model excels in
coding and handling complex problems and comes with a better
understanding and reasoning of world knowledge than previous models.
It has a context window of 2 million tokens and can use tools like
Google Search and execute code on behalf of users. 

 AMAZON PLANS TO UNVEIL NEXT-GENERATION ALEXA AI LATER THIS MONTH (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Amazon is revamping Alexa into a generative AI service that will be
able to hold complex, context-aware conversations with users and
handle multifaceted requests. The company will be AI models from
Anthropic's Claude rather than its own in-house technology as early
versions of Amazon AI had trouble responding in a timely manner. There
are more than 100 million active Alexa users and over 500 million
Alexa-enabled devices, so it is important for Amazon to get Alexa AI
right. Amazon plans to introduce the new version of Alexa just ahead
of when Apple is expected to begin testing its new version of Siri.

 A FLOODED QUARRY, A MYSTERIOUS MILLIONAIRE, AND THE DREAM OF A NEW
ATLANTIS (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Deep is a project aimed at increasing understanding of the ocean and
its critical role for humanity. It is funded by a single anonymous
private investor. The project will establish a permanent human
presence under the sea where people will be able to stay for up to 28
days at a time. It aims to eventually create permanent human
settlements in all oceans across the world. This article looks at the
engineering and science required for Deep to be successful. 

 BLUE ORIGIN SPINS UP LUNAR GRAVITY FOR NEW SHEPARD FLIGHT (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Blue Origin launched its New Shepard rocket again yesterday to
simulate lunar gravity for capsule payloads. The rocket lifted off at
1600 UTC and the capsule reached 105 kilometers above sea level before
returning to Earth. The capsule spun for about two minutes during the
flight to simulate lunar gravity. New Shepard's ability to provide a
lunar gravity environment is unique and valuable for researchers who
have their sights set on a return to the Moon. It enables researchers
to test lunar technologies at a fraction of the cost, rapidly iterate,
and test again in a significantly compressed time frame.

 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOPICS I'VE CHANGED MY MIND ON AFTER 10 YEARS IN
THE INDUSTRY (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Chris Kiehl is a software developer currently working for Amazon. He
wrote 'Data Oriented Programming in Java' and created Gooey, a tool
that turns almost any Python command-line program into a full GUI
application with one line. Four years ago, Kiehl posted a list of
software development topics he had changed his mind on after working
in the industry. This is an updated take on Kiehl's views - what he's
changed his mind on, the opinions he has picked up on the way, and the
things he has not changed his opinion on. 

 INGESTING MILLIONS OF PDFS AND WHY GEMINI 2.0 CHANGES EVERYTHING (7
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Gemini Flash 2.0 achieves near-perfect OCR accuracy while being
incredibly cheap. This article looks at how to use the model to parse
PDFs. There are still some issues with parsing, chunking, and bounding
box detection, but we are almost at the point where document parsing
is efficient and practically effortless. The work discussed in the
article will eventually be open sourced, but there are likely to be
other similar libraries available.

 PERSONAL SOFTWARE (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI has changed our relationship with software - software can now
adapt to users. The technology makes it possible for anyone to create
single-use or custom applications. Within the next decade, millions of
people will be able to create their own software and build their own
ideas. More builders will mean more innovation - individuals will have
the freedom to solve their own problems. 

 S1: THE $6 R1 COMPETITOR? (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 s1 is a recently released model that is making waves in the AI
community because it shows how close the industry is to making some
very large breakthroughs in AI. The paper released with the model
sheds light on how reasoning models work. In s1, when the model tries
to stop thinking, is it forced to keep going - this makes it begin to
second guess and double check its answer. s1 cost only $6 to train as
its creators used a small model and hardly any data. Innovations like
s1 that dramatically lower costs allow researchers to learn and
understand models faster, which directly translates to a faster pace
of AI development.

 WHY AMAZON IS BETTING ON ‚ÄòAUTOMATED REASONING' TO REDUCE AI'S
HALLUCINATIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Automated reasoning uses mathematical proofs to ensure that systems
behave in a certain way - it can be used to check whether models are
providing accurate answers. 

 WHY IQ IS A POOR TEST FOR AI (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Many experts say that IQ is a poor measure of a model's capabilities
because IQ tests are relative measures of certain kinds of
intelligence in humans and they don't measure practical intelligence. 

 YOU NEED MORE THAN A VECTOR DATABASE (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Vector search is only one piece of the puzzle - users will demand
platforms that cover full-text search, vectors, message streaming,
session management, and more as the generative AI market matures. 

 UNDERSTANDING REASONING LLMS (28 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This article discusses the main approaches to building reasoning
models and how large language models can be enhanced with reasoning
capabilities. 

 GROWING UP AI-FIRST (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The kids of today will be growing up in a very different world thanks
to AI, but they'll be fine.
