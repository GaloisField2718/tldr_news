 WHAT IS FREE TRIAL ABUSE, AND HOW CAN YOU STOP IT? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Free trials are meant to drive adoption, not rack up costs. But for
modern SaaS apps, trial abuse is a growing threat: fake signups,
disposable emails, and automated account farming drain compute and
distort metrics.

WorkOS Radar [5] helps stop abuse before it spreads. With built-in
protection [6] against bots, brute force attacks, and even impossible
travel logins, and free trial abuse itself, your app gets the
real-time defense it needs.

 TESLA BEGINS LIMITED ROBOTAXI SERVICE IN AUSTIN (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tesla began limited operations of its self-driving taxi service
yesterday in Austin, Texas. The service is only available to 'Early
Access' riders and the vehicles are confined to certain streets. Tesla
employees will be riding in the front passenger seats and the vehicles
may not operate in bad weather. Tesla's stock market valuation rests
largely on promises that the company will be able to use artificial
intelligence to allow its vehicles to drive autonomously pretty much
anywhere there are roads - the Austin project will provide the first
indications of whether Tesla's technology can match its ambitions. 

 META, ESSILORLUXOTTICA UNVEIL OAKLEY SMART GLASSES (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Meta and EssilorLuxottica revealed the Oakley Meta HSTN on Friday.
The HSTN smart glasses feature Meta's artificial intelligence
assistant and have a starting price of $399. They contain Oakley's
PRIZM Lens technology, which helps athletes see better across changing
light and weather conditions. The glasses will come in various
frame-and-lens color combinations - a limited edition with gold lenses
and accents will be available for $499. The limited-edition version
will be available to preorder on July 11 and the standard Oakley Meta
HSTN will go on sale later this summer.

 PSYCHE KEEPS ITS DATE WITH AN ASTEROID, BUT NOW IT'S RUNNING IN
BACKUP MODE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The NASA Psyche spacecraft launched in October 2023 and proceeded
normally until April 1 this year, when it detected a drop in pressure
inside the line that feeds xenon fuel to its four thrusters. The craft
reacted to the pressure signature by powering off the thrusters - this
will have no effect on the mission's scheduled arrival at asteroid
Psyche in August 2029. The spacecraft recently switched to its backup
fuel line and resumed full thruster operations. The next waypoint on
Psyche's voyage will be a flyby of Mars in May 2026. 

 MIT STUDENT PRINTS AI POLYMER MASKS TO RESTORE PAINTINGS IN HOURS (5
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MIT graduate student Alex Kachkine developed a technique that uses
AI-generated polymer films to physically restore damaged paintings in
hours. It works by printing a transparent 'mask' containing thousands
of precisely color-matched regions that conservators apply directly to
an original artwork. These masks can be removed whenever needed, so
it's a reversible process. Using the technique creates a digital
record of what mask was used, so future conservators will have an
extremely clear understanding of what was done to every artwork.

FROM AWS SOLUTION ARCHITECTS (SPONSOR) [12] 

 The cloud is often too complex to navigate without a map — and a
great diagram can be that map. Read this Datadog eBook for a framework
from AWS Solution Architects [12] on how to diagram your cloud
architecture using best practices + how to plan environments with

 HOW TO VIBE CODE AS A SENIOR ENGINEER (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Vibe coding is a new way of building software where you let the AI
models do most of the work. Users write prompts, sketch out a plan,
and let the model take over. This allows users to build features in
hours, but it requires some experience to wield. This article provides
some tips on how to vibe code for people who know what they're doing.
It covers how to write a good prompt, what AI is good and bad at, the
required tools for vibe coding, and more. 

 AI-ASSISTED CODING FOR TEAMS THAT CAN'T GET AWAY WITH VIBES (9 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Serious engineering teams that want to build thoughtful, well-crafted
products need to learn to use AI as it can result in building better
products. Building with AI is fast - the velocity gains are important
as they allow teams to tighten feedback loops with users faster. Using
AI to write software requires a huge shift that challenges some of the
ideas previously considered common wisdom. This post looks at how
teams should approach working with AI tools.

 APPLE EXECUTIVES HAVE HELD INTERNAL TALKS ABOUT BUYING AI STARTUP
PERPLEXITY (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apple is considering potentially bidding for artificial intelligence
startup Perplexity AI to address the need for more AI talent and
technology. The internal discussions are at an early stage and may not
lead to an offer. Acquiring Perplexity would help Apple develop an
AI-based search engine, which could help it cope with the potential
loss of its longstanding arrangement with Google. Meta tried to buy
Perplexity earlier this year, but the companies failed to reach an
agreement. 

 SILICON VALLEY'S ‘TINY TEAM' ERA IS HERE (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Startups trying to reach unicorn status used to aim to hire rapidly,
but these days, the bragging rights are going to entrepreneurs who can
keep their headcount the lowest. Fast and lean growth has been made
possible by AI assistants, advisers, coders, and marketers. Companies
with just a handful of employees are now claiming tens or even
hundreds of millions in annual revenue through botscaling.
