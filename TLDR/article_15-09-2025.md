 GOOGLE GEMINI IS THE TOP FREE IPHONE APP (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Gemini for iPhone is the top free app in the US App Store. ChatGPT is
in second position, and Threads is third. The Gemini app ranks second
in Canada and the UK. It has seen more than 23 million new users since
its launch. Google's new image editing model has been a viral hit due
to how it maintains character likeness and consistency. 

 ELON MUSK'S BORING COMPANY COMPLETES VEGAS LOOP TUNNEL TO AIRPORT (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Boring Company has successfully completed a 2.26-mile tunnel for
the Vegas Loop system in Las Vegas. The tunnel, aimed at alleviating
surface congestion in one of America's busiest tourist destinations,
stretches from a site near Harry Reid International Airport in the
south to the Westgate Resort in the north. There will be eight
stations along the route, including key stops at Virgin hotels and the
Hughes Center. The tunnel is part of a broader plan to create a
68-mile network with over 100 stations to connect major landmarks.

 PROMISING NEW EPILEPSY DRUG DELIVERS 80% REDUCTION IN SEIZURES (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Rapport Therapeutics' experimental compound, RAP-219, reduced
seizures by an average of 77.8% in a Phase 2a study. Almost a quarter
of participants remained seizure-free over the two-month treatment
period. The study raises hopes for patients who suffer from seizures
despite being on multiple medications. Rapport plans to meet with the
US Food and Drug Administration and then launch two Phase 3 trials
next year. It is also developing a long-acting injectable version to
address medication adherence, a frequent challenge in epilepsy. 

 NASA ANNOUNCES DISCOVERY OF LIFE ON MARS WITH HIGH DEGREE OF
CONFIDENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An analysis of the Martian Sapphire Canyon mudstone core found
minerals and textures that are often linked to microbial activity.
While nonbiological chemistry could also explain the signals, the
finding is the closest scientists have ever come to discovering life
on Mars. More data is needed to rule out nonbiological sources.

 HOW END-TO-END OBSERVABILITY BREAKS DOWN SILOS (SPONSOR) [8] 

 When frontend and backend teams operate in silos, they create
performance bottlenecks that can lead to user churn. Read this Datadog
eBook [8] to learn how unified observability delivers full-stack
visibility, reduces MTTR, and ensures every user experience is
seamless. Read the eBook → [8] 

 GET EXCITED ABOUT POSTGRES 18 (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Postgres18 adds asynchronous I/O, which means faster reads for many
use cases. This is a part of a bigger series of performance
improvements planned. Asynchronous I/O allows workers to optimize idle
time and improve system throughput by batching reads. It provides a
more predictable and better-performing method for batching operations
at the database level. Writes will continue to be synchronous as this
is needed for ACID compliance. 

 UTF-8 IS A BRILLIANT DESIGN (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 UTF-8 was designed to represent millions of characters from different
languages and scripts and still be backward compatible with ASCII.
Every ASCII-encoded file is a valid UTF-8 file, and every UTF-8
encoded file that only has ASCII characters is a valid ASCII file.
This post gets into how UTF-8 works. A link to a playground for
visualizing and playing around with UTF-8 encoding is available in the
post.

 A.I.'S PROPHET OF DOOM WANTS TO SHUT IT ALL DOWN (14 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Eliezer Yudkowsky, the founder of the Machine Intelligence Research
Institute (MIRI), a Berkeley-based nonprofit that studies risks from
advanced artificial intelligence, believes that building powerful AI
systems is a terrible idea that will end in disaster. He recently
released a book co-written with MIRI's president aimed at stopping the
development of AI. The book claims that everyone on Earth will die if
any company or group anywhere on the planet builds an artificial
superintelligence using anything remotely like current techniques.
While some may see Yudkowsky as an extremist or a crank, he is a
central figure in modern AI history, and his influence on the industry
is undeniable. 

 ‘MORE EGALITARIAN': HOW NEPAL'S GEN Z USED GAMING APP DISCORD TO
PICK PM (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 14 governments representing three parties have taken turns at
governing Nepal since 2008, when the country adopted a new
constitution after abolishing its monarchy. After recent protests, the
country's citizens used a virtual poll on Discord to elect its new
leader. A Gen Z group called Hami Nepal ran a channel where a debate
on the country's future was livestreamed. After hours of debate,
participants selected former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki
to lead Nepal.
