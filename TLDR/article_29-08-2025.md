 MICROSOFT STARTS TESTING AI MODEL THAT COULD ESCALATE COMPETITION
WITH OPENAI (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Microsoft has started testing its MAI-1-preview model on LMArena.
MAI-1-preview is a foundation model trained end-to-end in-house by
Microsoft. The model will be rolled out for certain text use cases
within Copilot over the coming weeks. Developers can fill in a form to
request early access. 

 ELON MUSK REVEALS WHEN SPACEX WILL PERFORM FIRST-EVER STARSHIP CATCH
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk says that SpaceX will attempt to catch Starship on Flight
13, 14, or 15, depending on how well the V3 flights go. The V3 rocket
is more powerful than V2 in terms of initial thrust and booster
thrust, and it has a higher payload-to-orbit rating. V4 will likely be
the first version to carry humans to space. Musk has previously said
that SpaceX hopes to attempt a catch of Starship this year, but the
company will need to launch two more flights before the end of the
year to get to his expected first catch attempt of Flight 13.

 STARSHIP WILL REDUCE BANDWIDTH LAUNCH COST BY UP TO 50X (12 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Even if fully expendable, Starship already has an around 40% lower
cost per kilogram than a mature Falcon 9. With reuse, Starship's cost
per kilogram quickly falls towards a $60 per kilogram floor. Starship
introduces a different cost regime that will transform the industry to
be supply-rich, price-flexible, and capability-driven. For Starlink,
this will mean faster scale, richer service tiers, and room to price
for demand and margin. 

 THE WORLD'S LARGEST SAND BATTERY JUST WENT LIVE IN FINLAND (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Finnish Firm Polar Night Energy has built an industrial-scale sand
battery in Pornainen, Finland. The battery is set to reduce carbon
emissions from the local heating network by as much as 70%. At 42 feet
tall and 50 feet wide, the battery can store up to 100 MWh, enough to
heat the whole town for a week. The sand battery can hold a charge for
months at a time, helping balance the energy grid during periods of
high demand. A video of the battery being put together is available in
the article.

 INTRODUCING GPT-REALTIME AND REALTIME API UPDATES FOR PRODUCTION
VOICE AGENTS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI's Realtime API, powered by gpt-realtime, enables developers to
build reliable, production-ready voice agents. It supports remote MCP
servers, image inputs, and phone calling through Session Initiation
Protocol. OpenAI has released two new voices in the Realtime API,
Cedar and Marin. OpenAI's most advanced speech-to-speech model yet,
gpt-realtime shows improvements in following complex instructions,
calling tools with precision, and production of speech that sounds
more natural and expressive. 

 GROK CODE FAST 1 (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 grok-code-fast-1 is a speedy and economical reasoning model that
excels at agentic coding. xAI built the model from scratch using a
brand-new model architecture. The model has mastered the use of common
tools like grep, terminal, and file editing. It is free for a limited
time for users of select launch partners, including GitHub Copilot,
Cursor, Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code, opencode, and Windsurf.

 WILL ALL OUR DRUGS COME FROM CHINA? (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The West's big car manufacturers are facing an existential threat
from Chinese manufacturers, which relatively recently began pushing
the boundaries of performance, cost-efficiency, driver experience, and
autonomy. Western carmakers have been content to innovate in a gradual
way for far too long, and it could cease to be competitive. This could
also happen to the biotech industry. There has been a steady rise in
Chinese companies as a source of genuinely new drugs. Chinese
companies are now responsible for about a quarter of new trial starts.


 ARE PEOPLE'S BOSSES REALLY MAKING THEM USE AI TOOLS? (13 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Many companies are making employees use AI tools, outsourcing
responsibilities to a technology that often gets things completely
wrong. AI is completely incapable of doing analytical work that
requires creative and soft skills and a lot of experience. Large
language models are language processing systems, so it shouldn't be
surprising that they can only regurgitate generic advice. Workers
stuck using AI tools need to document their use carefully so they are
able to demonstrate how the tools cause problems, slowdowns, or other
disappointing outcomes.
