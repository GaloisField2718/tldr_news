 START VIBE SHIPPING WITH THE NEW V0 BY VERCEL (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Vibe coding lowered the barrier to entry for prototypes, but can you
vibe code production features? With v0 by Vercel [4], you can.

By generating real, production-ready code for each prompt, v0 helps
teams escape the prototype trap. It's the same usability as
traditional vibe coding with security, compliance, and code review [4]
built in.

No more poor quality AI code clogging up your backlog. Just prompt,
preview, and ship. Start shipping [4]

 ELON MUSK'S SPACEX SAID TO CONSIDER MERGER WITH TESLA OR XAI (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SpaceX may potentially merge with Tesla and xAI. Some investors are
pushing the idea, saying it could attract sizable interest from
infrastructure funds and Middle Eastern sovereign investors. No final
decisions have been made, and details could change - the companies may
decide to remain separate. SpaceX is considering an IPO in June around
Elon Musk's birthday. 

 OPENAI PLANS FOURTH-QUARTER IPO IN RACE TO BEAT ANTHROPIC TO MARKET
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is holding informal talks with Wall Street banks about a
potential initial public offering in the fourth quarter of this year.
2026 is expected to be a blockbuster year for stock market debuts
after a drought. Some on Wall Street are speculating that this year
could be the biggest year ever for IPOs. OpenAI, Anthropic, and SpaceX
are among the most closely watched tech companies that could go
public.

 CUSTOM MACHINE KEPT MAN ALIVE WITHOUT LUNGS FOR 48 HOURS (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 An artificial lung system built by a team at Northwestern University
successfully kept a critically ill patient alive long enough to enable
a double lung transplant. The surgery involved temporarily replacing
the patient's entire pulmonary system with a synthetic surrogate. The
patient lived for two days without lungs. They received donor lungs
after 48 hours, when their body was no longer suffering from sepsis.
The patient has returned to a normal, independent life with excellent
lung function. 

 HOW DO WE QUANTIFY PROGRESS IN ROBOTICS? (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Offline data sets don't work because robots never do exactly the same
thing. These errors compound. Robots are hardware plus an algorithm,
and hardware factors often matter more to task execution than the
algorithm being used. Any real benchmark by necessity should look like
a human competition. There are already early versions of such events,
like the World Humanoid Games. However, major companies right now have
too much to lose and too little to gain to bother competing.

 THE FUTURE OF 10X ENGINEERING (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Generative AI will make engineers better. While it may make the gap
between the median and the max engineer shrink, the gap between the
great and the best engineers is about to get much larger. The top
engineers of the AI future will probably utilize a different skill set
than the top engineers of today. 

 I REPLACED A $120/YEAR MICRO-SAAS IN 20 MINUTES WITH LLM-GENERATED
CODE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 It's now possible to replace services with AI-generated code, if you
know what you're doing. It's only going to get easier. SaaS businesses
that don't give ongoing value are at risk of being replaced by
customers. The ease of developing these tools will mean that buying
and selling SaaS businesses will become less profitable.

 TESLA IS COMMITTING AUTOMOTIVE SUICIDE (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Tesla's Q4 2025 earnings call made it clear that the company is no
longer interested in being an automaker. The company has killed the
Model S and Model X and has no plans for new mass-market models. It is
pivoting entirely to 'transportation as a service'. Tesla will
continue to focus on robotaxis, humanoid robots, and their supporting
infrastructure, especially training compute. 

 AMAZON IN TALKS TO INVEST UP TO $50 BILLION IN OPENAI (3 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, is leading negotiations with OpenAI CEO Sam
Altman for an investment of up to $50 billion in OpenAI. The AI
startup is seeking up to $100 billion in a funding round that could
value it at up to $830 billion. Amazon has deep ties with Anthropic,
one of OpenAI's competitors. It has invested $8 billion in Anthropic
and is one of its key cloud providers. Amazon also developed an $11
billion data center campus for Anthropic.
