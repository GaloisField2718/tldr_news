 CHATGPT FUTURE JUST REVEALED — GET READY FOR A ‘SUPER ASSISTANT'
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Justice Department's antitrust case against Google revealed a
heavily redacted document from OpenAI from late 2024 that detailed the
company's internal strategy and its goal to create a de facto
'interface to the internet'. While much of the document was blacked
out, it was clear how much OpenAI expects ChatGPT to revolutionize the
internet. The company planned to spend the first half of 2025 building
out ChatGPT as a super assistant and then shift in the second half to
generating monetizable demand. One of the company's cornerstone
strategies is to build out more data centers to keep up with ChatGPT's
ballooning user base. 

 GOOGLE NOW LETS YOU USE AI WITHOUT INTERNET ON SMARTPHONES (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Google's new app, Edge Gallery, allows users to download and use AI
models on smartphones. The Android app can be downloaded and installed
through a GitHub repository - an iOS version will be available soon.
There are several models available, including Gemma 3 and 3n and
Alibaba's Qwen 2.5 models. The models can be used without an internet
connection once installed.

 IT'S WAYMO'S WORLD. WE'RE ALL JUST RIDING IN IT (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Waymo cracked a million total paid rides in late 2023. By the end of
2024, it reached five million, and it is on track to blow past 20
million full autonomous trips by the end of the year. The company's
service is only available in a few cities right now, but it might be
available everywhere sooner than expected. The competition in the
industry is just getting started, with Tesla planning to reveal a
robotaxi service in the coming weeks. 

 ELON MUSK TO BUILD ENORMOUS TEXAS ‘GIGABAY' TO STORE 1,000
STARSHIPS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 SpaceX plans to build the biggest structure in the world to house up
to 1,000 Starship rockets per year. The gigabay is part of the
company's plans to launch multiple rockets per day to reach and
colonize Mars. Elon Musk estimates that SpaceX will need to launch up
to 2,000 rockets to Mars in every two-year window to carry the cargo
needed to set up a colony. He aims to send humans to Mars by 2029.

 CLAUDE CODE: AN ANALYSIS (BOOK) [12] 

 This is a report on Claude Code generated by Claude Opus 4 with the
help of almost all of the major flagship models. Claude Code is an
agentic coding tool with a few new novel components. It has a
streaming architecture that handles real-time model responses, tool
execution, and UI updates, safety systems that provide security
without disrupting workflow, a tool design that bridges AI reasoning
and system execution, and prompt engineering that reliably controls
complex model behavior. The report covers the foundation of Claude
Code's architecture, data structures and the information architecture,
control flow and the orchestration engine, tools and the execution
engine, and much more. 

 SYSTEMS CORRECTNESS PRACTICES AT AMAZON WEB SERVICES (22 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 AWS strives to deliver reliable services that customers can trust
completely, which requires maintaining the highest standards of
security durability, integrity, and availability. Systems correctness
serves as the cornerstone for achieving these priorities. This article
looks at the formal methods used across AWS to deliver complex
services with high confidence in correctness. It covers more
traditional formal approaches such as theorem proving, deductive
verification, and model checking, as well as more lightweight
semi-formal approaches such as property-based testing, fuzzing, and
runtime monitoring.

 FOR SOME RECENT GRADUATES, THE A.I. JOB APOCALYPSE MAY ALREADY BE
HERE (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Millions of young graduates are entering into industries that have
little use for their skills, view them as expensive and expendable,
and are rapidly phasing out their jobs in favor of artificial
intelligence. This emerging crisis for entry-level workers is being
fueled in part by rapid advances in AI capabilities. Unemployment for
recent college graduates has jumped to an unusually high 5.8% in
recent months. While some executives are making a calculated bet on AI
systems, there are many risks, for example, the expectation that
entry-level jobs are short-lived may lead companies to underinvest in
job training, mentorship, and other programs aimed at entry-level
workers, leaving those workers unprepared for more senior roles later
on. 

 THE U.S. PLAN TO HOBBLE CHINA TECH ISN'T WORKING (9 MINUTE READ) [15]


 US efforts to win the tech race against China have so far failed.
While White House officials and their proxies want to ban the export
of AI microchips and the tools to make them, some outside the
administration say that such policies are backfiring by accelerating
China's development of its own tech ecosystem. The debate comes down
to whether it is better to have China dependent on US tech or if the
national security risk of China having US tech is too great. China's
well-organized, well-funded, and consistent push for self-sufficiency
has lessened its dependence on other countries, and each year it
produces a greater proportion of everything it needs.
