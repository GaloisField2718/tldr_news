 DELVE SHIPMAS DAY 2: AI VENDOR RISK MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Welcome to Delve Shipmas. Every day this week, Delve is launching a
new AI feature to make compliance more modern than ever. Yesterday, we
launched Delve's AI Copilot that can help on any compliance task or
question. Today, we're launching... AI VENDOR RISK MANAGEMENT

Vendor risk management is _painful_. Dozens of vendors, endless
questionnaires, and unclear risk levels. Delve's AI VRM handles this
automatically by auto-gathering security evidence from each vendor,
creating creating findings, and giving you a clear view of your risk
posture. Leave spreadsheets and legacy platforms in the past and enter
the future of risk with Delve AI.

 INSTAGRAM'S ADAM MOSSERI ON HOW TO BEAT TIKTOK — ON YOUR PHONE AND
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, still wasn't sure how people would
use Instagram's TV app on Amazon Fire the day before the integration
rolled out. The team knew they would get things wrong, but they were
ready to learn and iterate quickly. Instagram is likely to change
dramatically in the next few years. The platform plans to let users
proactively shape content on their feeds in a way that will feel
fundamentally different. 

 IT SURE SEEMS LIKE THE FOLDABLE IPHONE WILL BE A WIDE BOI (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Apple's Foldable iPhone is rumored to have an aspect ratio similar to
that of Apple's largest iPads when viewed in landscape mode. It is
expected to arrive in the fall of 2026 along with the iPhone 18 Pro. A
wider foldable could help distinguish the device from Android
book-style foldables. Samsung is apparently planning to release its
own foldable with a wide aspect ratio in Q3 2026 to compete with the
foldable iPhone.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SCIENTISTS FIND A WAY TO 'REBOOT' VISION IN ADULTS WITH LAZY EYE (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lazy eye, or amblyopia, can occur when one eye is deprived of vision
early in life. The lack of input disrupts synapse formation in the
brain's primary visual cortex, weakening vision in that eye. A new
mouse study has found that briefly and reversibly anesthetizing the
retina of an amblyopic eye for just a few days can restore the brain's
visual responses to that eye. While it is clear that the treatment
seems to reset the way the brain engages with specific neurons,
scientists still haven't figured out exactly why this is happening. 

 YOUR LAPTOP ISN'T READY FOR LLMS. THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE (10 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Laptop designs need to be upgraded to make running AI models locally
possible. The average laptop is underpowered for large language
models. The most obvious way to boost a PC's AI performance is to
place a powerful NPU alongside the CPU. Another upgrade required for
PCs to run AI models is a unified memory architecture that provides
all system resources to the same pool of memory over a fast,
interconnected memory bus.

 A YEAR OF VIBES (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 2025 was the year of agents. The year saw huge developments with
large language models and tool execution. Developers can now build a
lot of their own tools rather than depending on services. However,
this has surfaced some problems, like a lot more unreviewed AI slop in
pull requests. 

 AI SDK 6 (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Vercel's AI SDK is the leading TypeScript toolkit for building AI
applications. It provides a unified API that allows developers to
integrate with any AI provider. The SDK enables developers to build
everything from chatbots to complex background agents. Version 6
introduces agents, tool execution approval, DevTools, full MCP
support, reranking, image editing, and more.

 TRAINING THE IDEA MUSCLE (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Riley Walz is known for his many creative projects. He always has
over 50 ideas in his backlog at any point, so there's always something
for him to do. Walz only works on ideas he thinks are fun. If you
reject your own ideas, the part of the brain that comes up with ideas
is going to stop. Making your ideas a reality again and again is the
only way to generate better ones over time. There's no such thing as
an impossible idea. 

 12 PREDICTIONS FOR 2026 (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This post contains 12 predictions for 2026 from a venture capitalist.
2026 will be the year enterprises productionize AI. It will be a
record year for liquidity, though AI budgets will receive scrutiny for
the first time. Labs will stop competing on every frontier as Google
distances itself from competitors. Cloudflare will become the
gatekeeper for agentic payments.
