 NVIDIA TAKES AN ADDED ROLE AMID AI CRAZE: DATA-CENTER DESIGNER (7
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is trying to build Nvidia into a one-stop
shop for all of the key elements in a data center. The strategy is
designed to make the company's offerings stickier for customers.
Nvidia is also building a business that supplies AI-optimized
Ethernet, a business that is expected to generate billions of dollars
in revenue within a year. The competition in the space is growing,
with companies like AMD bolstering their data-center offerings and
chip suppliers like Intel offering services and systems to help
customers build and operate AI tools. 

 OPENAI SEARCHES FOR AN ANSWER TO ITS COPYRIGHT PROBLEMS (17 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is offering $1 million to $5 million a year deals to
publishers for data that it has mostly already scraped. While these
deals may give the company access to APIs for more up-to-the-moment
queries, the payments are more of a way to ensure that publishers
don't sue OpenAI for the stuff it has already scraped. A lawsuit would
be much more expensive for OpenAI. Its current lawsuit with The New
York Times may end up costing it at least $7.5 billion in statutory
damages alone.

 NEW HYDROGEL ‚ÄòINVENTION' COULD SLOW, TREAT ARTHRITIS IN EARLY
STAGES, CLAIMS CHINA (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scientists in China have developed a hydrogel that may be able to
treat osteoarthritis and slow down disease progression. The hydrogel
restores cartilage lubrication, preventing the progression of early
osteoarthritis. It is comprised of tiny hollow spheres made of a
biomaterial derived from natural protein and a synthetic polymer, the
combination of which creates a favorable environment for cell growth
and hydration. The treatment is able to precisely target small areas
of inflammation. The hydrogel has shown promise in rat studies,
outperforming traditional treatments in terms of reducing friction and
improving joint lubrication. 

 WHAT A 160-YEAR-OLD THEORY ABOUT COAL PREDICTS ABOUT OUR SELF-DRIVING
FUTURE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Greater efficiency in deploying a resource causes demand for that
resource to skyrocket, negating any expected decline in total usage.
For example, people responded to improved light bulb efficiency by
installing so many more of them there has been no decline in the total
energy consumed by lighting. Jevons paradox, which describes this
phenomenon, explains why efficiency improvements can backfire and
cause the opposite outcome from what was intended. Autonomous vehicles
promise increased safety and lower environmental impact, but Jevons
paradox predicts that total crashes and emissions will likely increase
rather than fall.

 AMAZON S3 NOW SUPPORTS CONDITIONAL WRITES (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Amazon S3 now supports conditional writes that can check for the
existence of an object before creating it. This helps developers more
easily prevent applications from overwriting any existing objects when
uploading data. Conditional writes can be used to simplify how
distributed applications with multiple clients concurrently update
data in parallel across shared datasets. Developers no longer need to
build any client-side consensus mechanisms to coordinate updates or
use additional API requests to check for the presence of an object
before uploading data. The feature is available at no additional
charge in all AWS regions. 

 WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM VINTAGE COMPUTING (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Thanks to open source, no technology ever has to become obsolete as
long as there is a community to support it. Working with vintage
technologies is fun, helps developers learn more about computer
science, and preserves computing history. There are many lessons to be
learned from the 'old ways'. This article looks at several projects
keeping older technologies alive and the lessons that can be learned
from them.

 FOR YEARS, TECH FIRMS WERE FIGHTING A WAR FOR TALENT. NOW THEY ARE
WAGING WAR ON TALENT (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The tech labor market in the 21st century went from cold to
overheated over the span of many years - it wasn't sudden. Tech firms
have now changed significantly as these companies are starting to
prioritize cash flow. The operating environment has changed from one
that accepts a high tolerance for failure to one with very low, if not
zero, tolerance for failure. Tech must now operate within financial
constraints with very little room for negotiation. 

 WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE USE LINUX? (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 While Linux may be free, it demands more of the user than the
commercial offerings from Microsoft and Apple. Most computer users
aren't interested in an intellectual workout when all they want to do
is browse the web or use an app. Programmers should be different -
they should take the time to learn the operating system to develop a
better understanding of the basics of the Internet. While it may not
be easy to learn to use Linux, it's definitely worth it.
