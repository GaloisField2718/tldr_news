 TESLA OPTIMUS ROBOT CAN‚ÄôT BUILD CARS YET, BUT IT IS FOLDING CLOTHES
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk has shared a video of Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot
folding a shirt. The project has come a long way since a very early
prototype was shown at Tesla AI Day 2022. Tesla aims to eventually
have the robot in people's homes performing a wide range of tasks, but
it first plans to have them in its own manufacturing operations for
repetitive and or dangerous tasks. The video of the robot folding a
shirt is available in the article. 

 YOUTUBE APPEARS TO BE REDUCING VIDEO AND SITE PERFORMANCE FOR
AD-BLOCK USERS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 YouTube appears to be slowing down the site for ad-block users.
Turning off ad blockers immediately improves loading performance for
affected users. The ad-block detection causes strange issues, like a
lag that makes full-screen and comments not work or Chrome being
unable to load other webpages while YouTube is open. The slowdowns may
be due to ad blockers altering YouTube's code and unrelated to
YouTube.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 NEW SOLID STATE BATTERY CHARGES IN MINUTES, LASTS FOR THOUSANDS OF
CYCLES (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers at Harvard John A. Paulson SEAS have developed a new
lithium metal battery that can be charged in minutes and lasts at
least 6,000 charging cycles. Lithium metal batteries offer far better
energy density and much lower weight than their lithium-ion
counterparts. The team has a list of other materials that could
potentially yield similar performance. The technology has been
licensed through a Harvard spinoff company that has scaled it up to
build a smartphone-sized pouch cell battery. 

 ID OF FIVE SUBTYPES OF ALZHEIMER'S HAS HUGE IMPLICATIONS FOR
TREATMENT (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An international team of neuroscientists has identified five distinct
subtypes of Alzheimer's disease. The finding has breakthrough
implications for treatment approaches and efficacy. The subtypes can
be identified by the categories of fluid surrounding the brains of
patients. Each of the five subtypes is linked to a unique genetic risk
profile. They reveal different molecular pathways to what has
traditionally been considered as one overall disease.

and languages. 

 SLASHING DATA TRANSFER COSTS IN AWS BY 99% (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 One of the easiest ways to accidentally spend too much money on AWS
is by carelessly transferring data. Any application that involves
sending data between resources in different availability zones will
incur such charges. These prices easily add up and are an extremely
high-margin source of profit for cloud providers. This article looks
at how to set up cross-availability zone infrastructure without paying
for data transfer costs. It suggests using S3, which already
replicates data between availability zones as part of its service.

 ELON MUSK WANTS MORE CONTROL OF TESLA, SEEKS 25% VOTING POWER (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Elon Musk said on Monday that he wants about 25% of voting control
over Tesla. Musk already owns around 13% of the company. He says that
he is uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics
without having the control. He wants to be influential, but not so
much that he can't be overturned. The bid for more control will add to
the pressure on Tesla's board of directors, who is already facing
investor concerns over several issues, including Musk's split focus,
the use of company resources, and federal probes. 

 ASK HN: WHY AM I SUDDENLY UNEMPLOYABLE? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [13] 

 People with a lot of coding experience and good referrals are
suddenly finding it hard to get employed. The job market has been
difficult for many job seekers. It appears that companies are looking
for very specific skills. The market is much slower than it was
between 2020-2022. Several commenters in this thread provide CV and
job-searching advice for those struggling to find work.
