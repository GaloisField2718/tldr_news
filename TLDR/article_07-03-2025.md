BIG TECH & STARTUPS

 GOOGLE CO-FOUNDER LARRY PAGE REPORTEDLY HAS A NEW AI STARTUP (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Dynatomics is a new company by Google co-founder Larry Page that is
focused on applying AI to product manufacturing. The company aims to
create highly optimized designs for objects and then have a factory
build them. The effort is being run by Chris Anderson, the previous
CTO of electric airplane startup Kittyhawk. Other companies exploring
the ways AI could be used to improve manufacturing processes include
Orbital Materials, PhysicsX, and Instrumental. 

 SPACEX STARSHIP SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL IN SECOND STRAIGHT TEST FLIGHT
FAILURE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX's Starship spiraled out of control while in space during a
test on Thursday - this is the second launch in a row that the vehicle
has run into a fatal problem on its way to orbit. Flights into major
Florida airports were briefly halted. The booster was successfully
caught for the third time by the launch tower. SpaceX had made
improvements to the lines that send fuel to Starship's engines,
changed the temperature of the propellent, and added extra vents and a
purge system ahead of the recent test flight.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SCIENTISTS DISCOVER THOUSANDS OF NEW MICROBIAL SPECIES THRIVING IN
THE MARIANA TRENCH (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Mariana Trench Environment and Ecology Research Project has added
over 6,000 new microbes to the number of species found at the deepest
regions of the ocean. Its investigations have revealed two adaptations
that allow the microbes to thrive under intense pressure and a mutated
gene that could boost their ability to survive. The study of these
organisms could yield new medications and information that could be
useful for engineering pressure- or radiation-resistant proteins. 

 INTUITIVE MACHINES IS SET FOR LUNAR LANDING – WITH HOPPING DRONE,
ICE DRILL, AND 4G (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander didn't crash, but it may not
be upright. The lander was set to descend at Mons Mouton, a plateau
near the lunar South Pole, at no earlier than 12:32 PM ET on Thursday.
It contains a drill to search for ice, a 4G network test, three
rovers, and a first-of-its-kind hopping drone. It is unclear how the
imperfect landing may impact the mission. Athena launched last
Wednesday aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

 A QUARTER OF STARTUPS IN YC'S CURRENT COHORT HAVE CODEBASES THAT ARE
ALMOST ENTIRELY AI-GENERATED (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 While each of the founders that Y Combinator funded in its current
cohort is highly technical and completely capable of building their
own products from scratch, a quarter of the startups have 95% of their
code bases generated by AI. Product builders who rely heavily on AI
will need to be good at reading code and finding bugs. VCs and
developers have been excited about AI-powered coding, with multiple
startups raising hundreds of millions of dollars in funding in the
last 12 months. 

 THE HOTTEST AI COMPANIES RIGHT NOW ARE ‘APPS' (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI wrappers are all the rage today - startups are offering AI
chatbots, research tools, and other software applications for coding,
clinicians, and customer service, all built at least in part on large
language models. Investors are eager to put money into these services.
However, some have started to question the wisdom of AI companies
powering billions into developing models as companies like DeepSeek
have proven competitive options can be created for much less. One of
the biggest concerns with AI app companies is that a large language
model developer may decide to compete directly with them, but it is
unlikely that AI developers will build verticalized apps for every
single possible use case.
