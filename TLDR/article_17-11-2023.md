 A FAILED AI GIRLFRIEND PRODUCT, AND MY LESSONS (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Inspired by Stanford's Western Town paper, which used a framework
combining memory, reflection, planning, and action to facilitate
interactions between GPTs, this developer decided to use a similar
framework to build an experience similar to what's depicted in the
movie 'Her'. This blog post details the lessons the developer learned
throughout the process. In the end, the project failed due to several
reasons. The chatbots would just wait for users‚Äô inputs rather than
reaching out and content moderation policies crippled the bots‚Äô
functionality.

 The idea of Objectives and Key Results seems simple - any problem can
be made solvable by the careful setting of Os and KRs. However, many
startups fail to implement the system. The system may work fine for a

but it causes confusion for everyone else. This may be by design: OKRs
may in fact be a subtle ploy to keep startups off balance.
