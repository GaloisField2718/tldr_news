 WORKOS AUTHKIT + RADAR: AUTHENTICATION WITH ABUSE PREVENTION
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Authentication isn't just login. It's building secure flows, managing
sessions, handling tokens, supporting SSO, and protecting user data.
AuthKit [5] gives you a fully hosted, customizable UI for sign-up,
MFA, password resets, and seamless SSO. Production-ready from day one.

But authentication alone doesn't stop abuse. WorkOS Radar [6] adds
real-time threat prevention: blocking bots, stopping brute force
attempts, and catching free trial abuse. Built-in defenses activate
instantly without custom scripts or logic.

 SAMSUNG'S EVENT SPOILED BY MASSIVE LAST-MINUTE LEAK (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 A reliable leaker has shared a whole bunch of marketing materials for
Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event (which kicks off today at 10 AM ET)
containing details and images of the company's upcoming devices. The Z
Fold 7 will measure 4.2 millimeters when unfolded and the Z Flip 7
will measure 6.5 millimeters when unfolded. None of the marketing
materials highlight an S Pen on the Z Fold 7, suggesting that the
device may not support an S Pen at all. The leaked material also
contains images and specs for new Galaxy Watches, which have upgraded
storage, displays, and batteries. 

 META INVESTS $3.5 BILLION IN WORLD'S LARGEST EYE-WEAR MAKER IN AI
GLASSES PUSH (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meta has bought a minority stake in EssilorLuxottica. It acquired
just under 3% of the Ray-Ban maker, a stake worth around $3.5 billion
at the current market price. Meta is considering further investment
that could build the stake to around 5% over time, though those plans
could still change. The deal provides EssilorLuxottica with a deeper
presence in the tech world.

 CHINA JUMPS AHEAD IN THE RACE TO ACHIEVE A NEW KIND OF REUSE IN SPACE
(9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 China likely completed the first high-altitude attempt at orbital
refueling sometime last week. Two of its satellites appeared to dock
together in geosynchronous orbit, coming together and then becoming
indistinguishable as a single object. Besides refueling satellites in
space, the technology could also be used to approach, capture, and
disable other satellites. The US Space Force plans to perform the
first refueling of a US military asset in orbit as soon as next year. 

 CRISPR BREAKTHROUGH ALLOWS SCIENTISTS TO EDIT MULTIPLE GENES
SIMULTANEOUSLY (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Scientists at ETH Zurich have developed a new CRISPR method that can
modify dozens of genes simultaneously. It can be used to
systematically modify entire gene networks in a single step. The
technique uses the lesser-known Cas12a enzyme, which is slightly more
precise in its ability to identify targeted genes and can handle
shorter RNA molecules compared to the traditional Cas9 enzyme. It
enables scientists to explore broad genetic interactions.

 INTRODUCING OPENCLI (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The OpenCLI specification defines a standard, platform and
language-agnostic interface to command-line applications that allows
both humans and computers to understand how a tool should be invoked
without access to source code or documentation. With the growing
interest in MCP (Model Context Protocol) and command-line automation,
there's a huge potential in standardizing how command-line
applications are described. The specification is still a draft and
incomplete. It is maintained under the Specter.Console GitHub
organization. 

 GEMINI NANO IN CHROME 137: NOTES FOR AI ENGINEERS (5 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Gemini Nano is starting to be shipped unflagged in Chrome and will
likely be shipped fully unflagged by the end of the year. There are a
few APIs available for commonly used patterns, but the main one
engineers will be interested in is the Prompt API, which is the most
flexible and open-ended one. This article goes through how to set up
and use Gemini Nano. It covers the basic important things and pitfalls
to be aware of when using the API.

 TECH PHILOSOPHY AND AI OPPORTUNITY (28 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 While AI is hailed as the route to abundance, the most important
financial outcomes have been about scarcity. One of these scarce
resources is AI talent. As the work needed to be done is the same
across the various companies bidding for talent, it makes sense that
the team that the best researchers play for is the team that pays the
most. The teams that are destined to lose are the ones who can't or
won't offer enough money or mission. 

 CTOS REVEAL HOW AI CHANGED SOFTWARE DEVELOPER HIRING IN 2025 (18
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 While AI evangelists promise the technology will make everyone become
a '10x developer', the reality is that companies are drowning in
AI-generated code that looks perfect but breaks in production. The
most valuable developers aren't the ones churning out AI code, but the
ones who can think their way out of the problems AI creates.
Engineering leaders want developers who can look at AI-generated code
and figure out what's wrong with it instead of just accepting whatever
the AI produces. AI was supposed to make coding easier, but it's
actually making the thinking parts of development more valuable than
ever.
