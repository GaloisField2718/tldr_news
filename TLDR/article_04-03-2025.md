 🚀 FASTER MOBILE APP RELEASES WITH AUTOMATED QA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-NATIVE SERVICE delivers 80% AUTOMATED TEST COVERAGE
IN WEEKS [6], with tests running on REAL IOS DEVICES and ANDROID
EMULATORS—all in 100% PARALLEL with ZERO FLAKES. [7]

✅ QA cycles reduced to just 15 minutes

✅ Multi-device + gesture interactions fully supported

✅ Reliable test execution with no flakes or false positives

✅ Zero flakes, human-verified bug reports

Engineering teams MOVE FASTER, releases stay on track, and testing
happens automatically—so developers can focus on building, not
debugging.

 T-MOBILE'S PARENT COMPANY IS MAKING AN AI PHONE WITH PERPLEXITY (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Deutsche Telekom and Perplexity are partnering to develop an AI phone
that will have Perplexity's AI integrated on a system-wide level.
Users will be able to interact with the phone's AI assistant even on
the lock screen. The phone will offer access to various AI providers.
It will have some agentic capabilities, but it is unclear yet how it
will execute tasks. The phone will be officially launched in the
second half of this year priced at under a thousand dollars and hit
the shelves at some point in 2026. 

 AMAZON-BACKED AI FIRM ANTHROPIC VALUED AT $61.5 BILLION AFTER LATEST
ROUND (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Anthropic has just closed a funding round at a $61.5 billion
post-money valuation. The $3.5 billion round was led by Lightspeed
Venture Partners - other investors included Salesforce, Cisco, and
Fidelity. Anthropic plans to use the funds to advance its development
of next-generation AI. It plans to expand its compute capacity, deepen
its research in mechanistic interpretability and alignment, and
accelerate its international expansion in Asia and Europe.

 NASA'S UPCOMING TELESCOPE LAUNCH AIMS TO ADDRESS SOME EXISTENTIAL
QUESTIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 NASA plans to launch a telescope this week to provide insight into
how the universe began. The SPHEREx telescope has a very wide field of
view. It can detect infrared light and other wavelengths too long to
be seen with the naked eye. The mission will image the entire universe
four times over two years and create a very large data set about the
visible universe. 

 ROCHE ROLLS OUT NEW DNA 'SEQUENCING-BY-EXPANSION' APPROACH (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Sequencing-by-expansion is a new proprietary method that pulls apart
DNA molecules and amplifies the signal of each individual base,
allowing scientists to avoid the time requirements of cycle-based
sequencing as well as the comparable difficulties in distinguishing
true signals among the noise. The technology is still in development
and not yet commercially available, but it could one day be suitable
for whole genome and exome sequencing as well as parsing RNA. The
science behind the technology represents a significant breakthrough
that addresses the limitations of existing sequencing solutions. It
has the potential to revolutionize the use of sequencing in research
and healthcare.

 AGENTS.JSON (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The agents.json Specification is an open specification that formally
describes contracts for API and agent interactions. It is built on
OpenAPI, the gold standard for describing how API endpoints work and
can be executed. The specification introduces flows and links to
enable AI agents to take the right sequence of actions. 

 YOKE IS REALLY COOL (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Yoke is a project that takes the idea of Infrastructure as Code to
the next level. It allows developers to write infrastructure
definitions in Go or Rust, compile them to WebAssembly, and then take
input and output from Kubernetes manifests that get applied to the
cluster. Yoke has a feature called Air Traffic Control, which is a
Kubernetes operator that lets developers define infrastructure as
CustomResourceDefinitions - the data in the CustomResource is passed
into the Flight you associate with it, and the Flight generates the
manifests that get applied to the cluster. Air Traffic Control makes
deploying things to clusters easier than ever.

 THE KILL-OR-BE-KILLED FIGHT FOR CRYPTO'S FUTURE (20 MINUTE READ) [16]


 The call to bring crypto into the mainstream through government
regulation has opened up a kill-or-be-killed battle among industry
players. New laws could be devastating for individual players
depending on what side of new rules they are on. Tether may be an
industry leader, but Circle has been calling for greater regulation
that would benefit Circle at Tether's expense. This article details
the battle between Circle and Tether, which has been going on since
crypto trading hit the mainstream in 2020. 

 YES, WE DID SHUT DOWN SALESFORCE A YEAR AGO, AS WE HAVE MANY SAAS
PROVIDERS (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Klarna shut down around 1,200 SaaS a year ago as it had developed an
internal tech stack that brought data and knowledge together,
resulting in serious productivity gains. The company found it was able
to use AI to quickly deploy new interfaces and interactions. There was
no longer any need for it to continue with a lot of its SaaS as the
tech stack allowed it to consolidate its technology and knowledge and
remove the silos. Besides the savings, Klarna gained the unification
and standardization of its knowledge and data.
