 CHATGPT‚ÄôS GROWTH IS FLATLINING (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ChatGPT has seen declining web traffic in five of the past eight
months. It is currently down 11% from its May 2023 peak. Its mobile
app has seen fewer users than Snapchat added last quarter alone. The
competition in the AI space means that OpenAI will have to pump out
hits to stay ahead. 

 APPLE VISION PRO 2 AT LEAST 18 MONTHS AWAY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The second generation of Apple's Vision Pro headset is at least 18
months away from launch. Apple is keenly interested in feedback from
customers who choose to return the first-generation headset as it will
use the information to perfect the next version of the device. The
Vision Pro will likely follow a refresh cycle longer than that of the
iPad. There are rumors that Apple may launch a more affordable Vision
headset around 2025.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE QUEST FOR A DNA DATA DRIVE (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The rate of information production is increasing faster than the
storage density of tape. Using current technologies will mean that, in
the coming decades, we will need exponentially more magnetic tape,
disk drives, and flash memory - as well as the factories to produce
the storage media. DNA is cheap, readily available, and stable at room
temperature for millennia. Organizations around the world are already
taking the first steps towards building a DNA drive that can both read
and write DNA data. 

 THIS TINY, TAMPER-PROOF ID TAG CAN AUTHENTICATE ALMOST ANYTHING (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MIT researchers have developed an antitampering ID tag that is tiny,
cheap, and secure. It is several times smaller and significantly
cheaper than the traditional radio frequency tags that are used to
verify product authenticity. The tags use glue containing microscopic
metal particles. This glue forms unique patterns that can be detected
using terahertz waves. The system uses AI to compare glue patterns and
calculate their similarity. The tags could be used to authenticate
items too small for traditional RFIDs.

 HTMZ (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 htmz is a minimalist HTML microframework for creating dynamic web
user interfaces. It allows developers to load HTML resources within
any element in a page. htmz only requires an inline HTML snippet to
work - there are no dependencies and no backend is required. 

 I'VE PUT A COMPLEX CODEBASE INTO A SINGLE 120K-TOKEN PROMPT, AND
ASKED 7 QUESTIONS GPT-4 AND GEMINI 1.5. HERE ARE THE RESULTS! (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This Reddit user recently put two complex codebases into
GPT-4-Turbo-128K and Gemini 1.5 and asked them questions. The
codebases implemented a parallel inet runtime, so it involved some
hard compiler stuff. Gemini 1.5 completely outperformed
GPT-4-Turbo-128K in the task of understanding the codebases. Most of
the questions that GPT-4 got wrong are ones it would have answered
correctly in a smaller context. Gemini still struggled to create a
complete mental model of the system, but it is extremely good at
locating existing information, making long-range connections, and
doing some limited reasoning on top of this information.

 GROQ IS SERVING THE FASTEST RESPONSES I'VE EVER SEEN (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Groq can serve up to 500 tokens per second. It is able to do this
because it uses custom hardware that utilizes Linear Processor Units
(LPUs) instead of GPUs. LPUs are designed to deliver deterministic
performance for AI computations. They offer a more streamlined
approach that eliminates the need for complex scheduling hardware,
allowing every clock cycle to be utilized effectively. The system
ensures consistent latency and throughput. LPUs can be linked together
without the traditional bottlenecks found in GPU clusters, making them
extremely scalable. 

 I PRINTED CHOCOLATE ON A 3D PRINTER AND ATE IT (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Cocoa Press is a 3D printer that prints chocolate. It is now
available for $3,995 prebuilt after a decade of development. Premade
chocolate cores cost $49 per pack of 10. The printer allows users to
program the heat of its nozzle to a tenth of a degree. It can create a
wide range of shapes and textures, but there are still some problems
to work out. This article shares what it is like using the machine.
Pictures of chocolate prints made by the machine are available.
