Ariane 6 rocket, from French Guiana today. Development of the rocket

 NEW FIBER OPTICS TECH SMASHES DATA RATE RECORD (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers from Japan and the UK have smashed the world record for
fiber-optic communications through commercial-grade fiber by producing
data rates four times as fast as existing commercial systems. They
achieved this by using optical amplifiers to boost signals across less
frequently used communication bands. The system can push 402 terabits
per second (Tbps) through the kinds of fiber-optic cables that are
already in the ground and underneath the oceans. The researchers
believe that it may be possible to push even further and reach up to
600 Tbps speeds.

 ‚ÄòWE'RE LIVING IN A NIGHTMARE:' INSIDE THE HEALTH CRISIS OF A TEXAS
BITCOIN TOWN (22 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Residents in Granbury, Texas are experiencing negative health effects
from a nearby Bitcoin mining facility. The facility generates a hum

people have gone to urgent care or the emergency room due to symptoms
caused by the facility. While there are no major medical studies on
the impacts of living near Bitcoin mining facilities, there is an

 THE RIGHT KIND OF STUBBORN (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Persistence and obstinance may seem similar, but they're different
kinds of behavior. Obstinate people won't listen - that's not true of
all determined people. Persistent people are attached to goals,
whereas the obstinate are attached to their ideas about how to reach
them. Obstinate people are often disproportionately likely to be
attached to the wrong details. Persistence often requires one to
change their mind. Successful people are often most engaged when you
disagree with them.
