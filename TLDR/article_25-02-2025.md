 🚀 FASTER MOBILE RELEASES WITH AUTOMATED QA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-NATIVE SERVICE delivers 80% AUTOMATED TEST COVERAGE
IN WEEKS [6], with tests running on REAL IOS DEVICES and ANDROID
EMULATORS—all in 100% PARALLEL with ZERO FLAKES. [7]

✅ QA cycles reduced to just 15 minutes

✅ Multi-device + gesture interactions fully supported

✅ Reliable test execution with no flakes or false positives

✅ Zero flakes, human-verified bug reports

Engineering teams MOVE FASTER, releases stay on track, and testing
happens automatically—so developers can focus on building, not
debugging.

 ANTHROPIC LAUNCHES A NEW AI MODEL THAT ‘THINKS' AS LONG AS YOU WANT
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model is designed to 'think' about
questions for as long as users want it to. It can give both real-time
answers and more considered, thought-out answers to questions. The
model is rolling out to all users and developers, but only premium
users will have access to its reasoning features. It will cost $3 per
million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, making it more
expensive than OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek's R1. 

 PERPLEXITY TEASES A WEB BROWSER CALLED COMET (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine company, has launched a
sign-up list for its upcoming browser, Comet. There are few details on
what the browser will do or what it looks like, but the company calls
it 'a browser for agentic search'. Perplexity's product portfolio is
growing at a rapid pace - it recently released a 'deep research'
product, an AI-powered assistant for Android, and an API for AI
search. It has reportedly raised over $500 million in capital from VCs
and is said to be valued at $9 billion.

 SPACE MISSION AIMS TO MAP WATER ON SURFACE OF THE MOON (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Lunar Trailblazer is set to begin its two year mission when it is
blasted into space on a SpaceX Falcon rocket on Thursday. The probe's
goal is to seek out water on the lunar surface. Scientists have
recently uncovered strong hints that there are significant quantities
of water on the surface of the moon. This water could potentially be
turned into hydrogen to be used as fuel and oxygen for humans to
breathe. 

 SPACEX TARGETING FRIDAY FOR NEXT TEST OF STARSHIP MEGAROCKET (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 SpaceX is targeting a launch window that opens at 5:30 PM on Friday
for its next Starship megarocket test flight, pending regulatory
approval. The previous test flight ended with Starship's upper stage
disintegrating, prompting cleanup and recovery efforts for fallen
debris. SpaceX has implemented numerous upgrades to the upper stage
for the upcoming flight to enhance reliability and performance. The
mission is expected to last just over an hour and will include another
attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower.

workflows, all through natural language commands. Claude Code can edit
files, fix bugs, execute and fix tests, search through git history,
resolve merge conflicts, create commits and PRs, and more. 

 JSON HAS BECOME TODAY'S MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT FORMAT ON UNIX (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 JSON has a bunch of pragmatic virtues in a modern UNIX system. It
provides a clear and basically unambiguous way to represent text and
most numeric data, and it's also generally extensible. There are
increasingly more tools to deal with and process JSON and it can
generally be transformed to various other formats if needed. Designing
a machine-readable output format is somewhat more complicated than it
looks - using JSON means that people writing programs don't have to
design their own formats.

 APPLE EXEC PHIL SCHILLER TESTIFIES THAT HE RAISED CONCERNS OVER APP
STORE COMMISSIONS ON WEB-BASED SALES (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Phil Schiller, the executive in charge of leading Apple's App Store,
testified in court that he had originally raised concerns about the
27% commission that Apple planned to charge app developers on
purchases made outside the App Store. He had claimed that it would be
a potential compliance risk and that the fee would create an
antagonistic relationship between Apple and developers. It would also
require Apple to have audit rights to check whether companies owe
Apple money for transactions that took place outside the App Store.
Apple's pricing committee ultimately decided to charge the commission
despite Schiller's concerns.

 FAST CASH VS. SLOW EQUITY (3 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Cash businesses print money, often immediately, but may have limited
long-term value, while equity businesses are more like planting a tree
- it takes considerably longer to replace your salary, but once you
do, those earnings are more durable and the business often has some
value of its own.
