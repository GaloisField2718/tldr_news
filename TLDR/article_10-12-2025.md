 HOW TO STOP BOTS FROM ABUSING FREE TRIALS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Free trials help AI apps grow, but bots and fake accounts exploit
them [5]. They steal tokens, burn compute, and disrupt real users. 

Cursor, the fast-growing AI code assistant, uses WorkOS Radar [4] to
detect and stop abuse in real time. With device fingerprinting and
behavioral signals, Radar blocks fraud before it reaches your app.

READ) [6]

could raise significantly more than $30 billion. It is targeting a
valuation of about $1.5 trillion for the entire company. SpaceX's
management and advisors are pursuing a listing as soon as mid-to-late
2026. The company is expected to produce about $15 billion in revenue
in 2025, increasing to up to $24 billion in 2026. 

 FROM LLAMAS TO AVOCADOS: META'S SHIFTING AI STRATEGY IS CAUSING
INTERNAL CONFUSION (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta is currently pursuing a Llama successor codenamed Avocado. The
model is expected to be released before the end of this year. Meta
seems to have shifted from its open source stance - Avocado could be a
proprietary model. Some people at Meta were reportedly upset that
DeepSeek used pieces of Llama's architecture in its R1 model, so the
company decided to overhaul its strategy.

 Elon Musk says that Tesla will remove safety monitors from the
passenger seats of Tesla Robotaxi vehicles in about three weeks.

 WHEN TRAINING TAKES A BACKSEAT, YOUR AI PROGRAMS DON'T STAND A CHANCE
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 One of the biggest reasons AI adoption stalls is because teams aren't
properly trained. This AI Training Checklist from You.com [10]
highlights common pitfalls and guides you to build a capable,
confident team that can make the most out of your AI investment.

 FACILITATING AI ADOPTION AT IMPRINT (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI adoption is a side quest for every engineering leader in the
current era. This guide shows how Imprint worked on the problem. You
have to be using the tools if you want to lead an internal AI
initiative. Real AI adoption on real problems is a complex blend of
domain context on the problem, domain experience with AI tools, and
old-fashioned IT issues. Model selection matters a lot. 

 THE RISE OF THE 0.1X ENGINEER (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Coding assistants allow anyone to become a 10x engineer. However, it
is the 0.1x engineers who will soon be the most valuable. These
engineers carefully curate code and set the right patterns rather than
prompting to add code. It is really easy to add bloat to a code base,
but really hard to differentiate dead code from LLM slop leftovers.

 OPENAI HIRES SLACK CEO DENISE DRESSER TO LEAD GLOBAL REVENUE STRATEGY
(2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI has hired Slack's CEO, Denise Dresser, as its chief revenue
officer. Dresser will oversee OpenAI's global revenue strategy across
both customer success and enterprise. She was an executive at
Salesforce for more than a decade before being named as Slack's CEO in
2023. OpenAI is on track to reach more than $20 billion in annualized
revenue run rate this year. It plans to grow to hundreds of billions
in sales by 2030. 

 THE BUBBLE IS LABOR (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Companies only hire people because they can't do all of the work
themselves. If every founder could handle all of the tasks themselves,
there wouldn't be anywhere near the number of jobs we have today. The
only reason the current labor market exists is because there's a group
of founders/owners who need help producing their goods and services.
These people aren't required to hire anyone, and the moment they can
do the work themselves, they will.
