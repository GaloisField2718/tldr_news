 THE OPENAI KEYNOTE (24 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI recently held its first-ever developer conference. This
article presents an analysis of the keynote and its main
announcements. The keynote was well-presented and entertaining. The
live demos went off without a hitch and leveraged the fact that they
were live. All of the new products and features announced were
immediately available rather than being available in the coming weeks
or months, as is increasingly the case for events like I/O or WWDC. 

 REDDIT IS STARTING TO TEST ITS OWN ADD-ONS FOR THE PLATFORM (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Reddit is starting to test add-ons built through its Developer
Platform. Its first add-ons include tools for mods to more easily
monitor and remove comment threads, ban spammers and remove their
content, and more. They will only be available to a small number of
subreddit mods. The Developer Platform is still in beta - it is
unknown when it will be generally available.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 ELON MUSK‚ÄôS NEURALINK IS WORKING ON A CHIP THAT WILL SOLVE
BLINDNESS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Neuralink is planning to release a vision chip that will solve eye
conditions that cause blindness within the next few years. The company
has received approval to start recruiting humans for its first
clinical trials. Its v0.9 chip aims to fix various ailments, including
quadriplegia due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS). Neuralink is still waiting for regulatory approval
for its first human tests. 

 CRUISE CONFIRMS ROBOTAXIS RELY ON HUMAN ASSISTANCE EVERY FOUR TO FIVE
MILES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cruise uses a remote assistance team to help its autonomous fleet in
certain situations. The company claims that remote assistance is being
used about 2-4% of the time on average in complex urban environments.
It says that the number is low enough that there isn't a huge cost
benefit to optimizing much further. The remote assistants mostly
provide wayfinding intel to the vehicle instead of controlling it
remotely and more than 98% of sessions are answered within 3 seconds.
It is an industry standard to have humans on call.

 ARE LANGUAGE MODELS GOOD AT MAKING PREDICTIONS? (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This post presents the findings of a study that looks at whether
GPT-4 can make good predictions. GPT-4's predictions are not well
calibrated - its predicted probabilities are often over-confident. Its
prediction ability varies depending on the category - for unclear
reasons, GPT-4 is well-calibrated for sports questions but
horrendously calibrated for personal questions. The model is better at
making predictions for politics than for science or technology. 

 SEEING LIKE A BANK (30 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Banks often look like notably disorganized institutions to their
customers, which is alarming and surprising for an entity that is
supposed to accurately keep track of all of the money. Banks are
extremely good at tracking ledgers, but bad at tracking other forms of
truth for structural reasons. In extreme cases, banks can feel like
they lack object permanence - every interaction can feel like you're
starting from the beginning. This article explains how it got to be
this way.
