 OPENAI UNVEILS A NEW CHATGPT AGENT FOR ‘DEEP RESEARCH' (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has announced a new AI agent designed to help people conduct
in-depth research. The new 'deep research' feature is designed for
situations where users need to perform precise and reliable research
using information from multiple sources. It is now available to
ChatGPT Pro users, limited to 100 queries per month. OpenAI is
targeting a Plus rollout about a month from now and support for Team
and Enterprise users is planned. The release will be geo-targeted -
there are currently no plans to release 'deep research' in the US,
Switzerland, or the European Economic Area. 

 TIKTOK'S TRAFFIC BOUNCES BACK DESPITE BEING PULLED OFF APP STORES,
FEARS OF SHUTDOWN (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DNS traffic for TikTok-related domains is currently around 10% lower
than pre-shutdown levels. The app briefly shut down in the US but came
back online after President Trump said he would postpone enforcement
of the ban. Traffic to TikTok alternatives peaked on the day TikTok
returned online. Many creators are expanding their online presence to
other platforms as TikTok's long-term future in the US remains
uncertain.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 CAN WE BUILD A FIVE GIGAWATT DATA CENTER? (26 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI labs will need data centers that require the power equivalent of
some of the US' largest cities by 2030. Forecasts predict that
training runs will require 5-gigawatt centers within five years -
GPT-4 was reportedly trained with 30 megawatts of power. While tech
leaders seem confident that they will be able to build data centers of
unprecedented size, these plans are still in the planning and
permission stages and actual sites that can support these projects are
scarce for several reasons. The US currently doesn't have the power,
funding, or permitting required to meet the forecasted AI data center
infrastructure demands, but it might be possible by 2030 through
permitting reform and substantial investment. 

 STABLECOINS ARE FINDING PRODUCT-MARKET FIT IN EMERGING MARKETS (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SpaceX faced problems accepting payments in developing markets as its
Starlink service expanded to more than 100 countries. This caused the
startup to turn to stablecoins, which allowed it to accept cheap and
near-instant cross-border transactions. Stablecoins are now a $205
billion market driven by real-world utility, particularly in emerging
markets. They are becoming a core part of financial markets and it is
possible they could replace outdated financial systems as adoption
accelerates.

 HOW TO WRITE A GOOD DESIGN DOCUMENT (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This essay provides tips on how to write, organize, and edit an
effective design document. A design document is a technical report
that outlines the implementation strategy for a system in the context
of tradeoffs and constraints. Its goal should be to convince the
reader that the design is optimal given the situation. Writing a
design document adds rigor to otherwise vague intuitions - it helps
the author think better. 

 HOW TO HAVE A CAREER EVEN WHEN OPENAI'S O3 DROPS (15 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 There is a real anxiety among students and junior professionals
regarding AI and its effects on their careers. The future will belong
to people whose work cannot be easily reduced to a dataset and those
who can use AI to become even better at what they do. Some jobs are
currently vulnerable because we can create clear benchmarks for
performance. AI will amplify the gap between high performers and the
rest.

 AMA WITH OPENAI'S SAM ALTMAN, MARK CHEN, KEVIN WEIL, SRINIVAS
NARAYANAN, MICHELLE POKRASS, AND HONGYU REN (REDDIT THREAD) [11] 

 Sam Altman, Mark Chen, Kevin Weil, Srinivas Narayanan, Michelle
Pokrass, and Hongyu Ren from OpenAI recently held a Reddit Ask Me
Anything session to talk about o3-mini and the future of AI. In the
thread, the representatives answer questions about advanced voice
mode, the upcoming 4o image generator, GPT-5, and more. OpenAI plans
to cut API prices in half in August. It doesn't have a timeline for
the release of GPT-5 yet - the company is still working on the 4o
series. 

 META IN TALKS TO REINCORPORATE IN TEXAS OR ANOTHER STATE, EXIT
DELAWARE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Meta is exploring its options as it plans to move its incorporation
from Delaware. Texas has presented itself as a better destination for
companies like Meta and the change wouldn't require that the company
relocate its corporate headquarters. While a majority of Fortune 500
companies are incorporated in Delaware, many have recently considered
moving due to rulings that bolster the rights of minority
shareholders. Texas has set up its own specialized business court
system, but it is too early to tell whether it will be more friendly
to businesses than the Delaware court has been.
