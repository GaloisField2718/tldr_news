 APPLE AIMS TO CAPITALIZE ON MINI APP TREND WITH NEW PROGRAM (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Apple's new Mini Apps Partner program gives Apple a 15% cut of in-app
purchases for mini apps and games within larger 'super apps'. Mini app
creators have been using loopholes to avoid Apple's in-app payments
framework. The new program should help lock those software creators
into Apple's preferred approach and guarantee more revenue for the
company. Mini apps or games must be released by a party not directly
or indirectly controlled by the developer of the dominant app to
qualify for the new program. 

 BLUE ORIGIN LANDS BOOSTER AFTER ROCKET LAUNCH AND MATCHES SPACEX'S
FEAT (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Blue Origin nailed the landing of its New Glenn rocket booster
yesterday. It is the second company to successfully accomplish the
feat. New Glenn's two successful launches in a row could win it a
sizable slice of the business of sending stuff to space. The New Glenn
booster is considerably bigger and heavier than SpaceX's Falcon 9
booster.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 ANDROID DREAMS (43 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Trying to predict the future is an excellent feedback mechanism for
developing a world model in areas you care about. You can review your
predictions to see what you got wrong and why. This site presents a
timeline for AI development that predicts that a continuously
improving AI that learns from interactions in the real world, with the
potential to become more expert at most tasks than even humans with 40
years of experience, won't be developed until after 2045. Winning
robotics is a national security issue - technology that gives its
owner access to users and resources at scale is a threat. There will
be a diversity of robot form factors in the future. 

 BIOHUB FOR NON-BIOLOGISTS: BEHIND PRISCILLA CHAN AND MARK
ZUCKERBERG'S PLAN TO CURE ALL DISEASES (68 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Biohub has a billion dollars a year
to make several long-horizon bets on basic science. Its aim is to
change our understanding of immunological science and open up the door
to engineering human health, simulating immune therapies,
reprogramming dysfunctional cells, and preventing diseases before they
arise. It has opened up three models on its virtual cells platform:
VariantFormer, a model that directly translates personal genetic
variations into tissue-specific gene activity patterns; CryoLens, a
large-scale model for cryoET that provides unsupervised structural
similarity analysis; and scLDM, a model that can generate realistic
single-cell data in silico at unprecedented fidelity. A transcript of
an interview with Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, where they
discuss the Biohub secret master plan, is available in the article.

 INTRODUCING GPT-5.1 FOR DEVELOPERS (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI has released GPT-5.1 on its API platform. The model can
dynamically adapt how much time it spends thinking based on the
complexity of tasks, making it significantly faster and more
token-efficient on simpler everyday tasks. It features a 'no
reasoning' mode to respond faster on tasks that don't require deep
thinking. OpenAI has extended prompt caching for up to 24 hours to
drive faster responses for follow-up questions at a lower cost.
Priority Processing customers will experience notably faster
performance with GPT-5.1 over GPT-5. 

 GENERATIVE UI SDK FOR FLUTTER (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 GenUI (Generative UI SDK for Flutter) is a Flutter library that lets
developers easily add interactive generative UI to their applications.
It is designed to help developers replace static walls of text from
large language models with dynamic and interactive graphical UIs. It
can turn conversations and agent interactions into rich, intuitive
experiences. State changes in the UI are fed back to the agent,
creating a high-bandwidth interaction loop.

 THE ADVICE I WOULD GIVE ON A MENTORSHIP CALL (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The most helpful mentors are usually folks who are only a few years
ahead of you. A person who is a decade ahead may be in an objectively
more impressive place, but someone nearer to your stage will have
experienced an environment that is much closer to your own. This post
contains advice for college freshmen seeking mentorship on managing
their time and looking for their first job. 

 TESLA AI DEPARTMENT TOLD TO PREPARE FOR ‘HARDEST YEAR' OF THEIR
LIVES (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Tesla engineers behind Autopilot, robotaxis, and the Optimus
robot have been told to brace for the 'hardest year of their lives' in
2026. The company aims next year to turn a decade of autonomy promises
into something commercial, scalable, and visible to investors. Tesla's
next era is tied to two products that are nowhere near mass
deployment. Elon Musk has previously claimed that Tesla's Optimus
robot could become the largest product in history.
