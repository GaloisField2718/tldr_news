MIGRATING RBAC TO FINE GRAINED AUTHORIZATION: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO
KNOW (SPONSOR) [4] 

Role-based access control (RBAC) is showing its age. Complexity, role
explosion, lack of flexibility, and poor UX are often impossible to
work around.
FINE-GRAINED AUTHORIZATION (FGA) solves all of these challenges. With
WorkOS’s 2-part blog series, you’ve got all the info you need to
migrate your RBAC implementation to FGA:

1️⃣ Designing your access model: [4] how to define resources,
relationships, and inheritance rules, and how to test and validate.

2️⃣ Integration in your app: [5] checking user access, managing
your FGA implementation, and favoring performance vs consistency on a
per request basis.

 OPENAI WILL START USING AMD CHIPS AND COULD MAKE ITS OWN AI HARDWARE
IN 2026 (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop custom silicon
designed to handle large AI workloads for inference. It has secured
manufacturing capacity with TSMC. The custom-designed hardware will
likely not start production until 2026. OpenAI's chip development team
reportedly includes lead engineers who have previously worked on
Google's Tensor processors for AI. 

 ELON MUSK'S XAI IN TALKS TO RAISE FUNDING VALUING IT AT $40 BILLION
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 xAI is in talks with investors regarding a funding round that would
value it around $40 billion. The startup was last valued at $24
billion just a few months ago. The funding discussions are in the
early stages, so terms are still subject to change and the talks could
fall apart. The company's current revenue sources include the X
Premium subscription and an API developers can use to build
applications with Grok.

 THE BATTERY REVOLUTION IS FINALLY HERE (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Solid-state cells, an emerging, ground-breaking technology, are
already hitting the market. These batteries solidify the traditionally
liquid electrolyte, enabling advantages such as higher energy density
and lower cost and weight. There are many different types of
solid-state cells. This article looks at several of the competitors in
this industry and their approaches to developing solid-state
batteries. 

 “IMPACT PRINTING” IS A CEMENT-FREE ALTERNATIVE TO 3D-PRINTED
STRUCTURES (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A team of researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
(ETH) Zurich claims to have developed a robotic construction method
that is better than 3D printing. Impact printing uses Earth-based
materials such as sand, silt, clay, and gravel to make homes. It is
less carbon-intensive and much more sustainable and affordable than 3D
printing. Earth-based materials are abundant, recyclable, available at
low costs, and can even be excavated at the construction site. The
researchers plan to commercialize this technology once they have a
prefabrication facility.

 GITHUB COPILOT MOVES BEYOND OPENAI MODELS TO SUPPORT CLAUDE 3.5,
GEMINI (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google Copilot is switching to a multi-model approach over the coming
weeks. It will roll out Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet to Copilot
Chat's web and VC Code interfaces over the next few weeks, with
Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro coming a bit later. GitHub is also adding
support for a wider range of OpenAI models, including GPT o1-preview
and o1-mini. Developers will be able to switch between the models to
tailor the model to fit their needs. Organizations will be able to
choose which models will be usable by team members.

 MORE THAN A QUARTER OF NEW CODE AT GOOGLE IS GENERATED BY AI (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google's third quarter 2024 earnings call highlighted how important
AI is to the company. More than a quarter of all new code at Google is
generated by AI, then reviewed and accepted by engineers. The company
reported $88.3 billion in revenue for the quarter. While many people
feel Google isn't as reliable as it once was, the company continues to
operate a very strong business. Google faces a potentially tough road
ahead - a breakup is on the table following a ruling that the company
is a monopolist in the search and advertising markets. 

 INSIDE INTEL, CEO PAT GELSINGER FUMBLED THE REVIVAL OF AN AMERICAN
ICON (15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Pat Gelsinger took the reins as Intel CEO three years ago with hopes
of reviving the American industrial icon. At the time, Intel had a
deal going with Taiwan's TSMC where TSMC would make chips that Intel
designed but could not produce at a deep discount. Gelsinger offended
TSMC by calling out Taiwan's precarious relations with China,
resulting in TSMC deciding to no longer honor the discount.
Gelsinger's affront to Taiwan was part of a series of missteps,
covered in this article, during his time as Intel CEO.
