 👋 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage — and staying there
— is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's AI-native service [5] gets engineering teams to 80%
automated end-to-end test coverage [6] and helps them SHIP 5X FASTER
by reducing QA cycles from hours to minutes.

QA Wolf [7] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [8] achieved
4x more test cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

 ELON MUSK-LED GROUP MAKES $97.4 BILLION BID FOR CONTROL OF OPENAI (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A group of investors led by Elon Musk offered $97.4 billion to buy
the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, but the offer was quickly
rejected. OpenAI's structure ensures that no individual can take
control of the company. Sam Altman and Musk co-founded OpenAI as a
charity in 2015. Musk left the company in 2019 and has since filed a
series of legal complaints against OpenAI accusing the company of
betraying its original nonprofit mission by creating a for-profit arm
and colluding with Microsoft to dominate the development of AI. 

 T-MOBILE'S STARLINK MESSAGING SERVICE IS NOW FREE TO TRY, EVEN IF YOU
AREN'T ON T-MOBILE (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 T-Mobile's Starlink-powered direct-to-cell satellite messaging
service is now open for anyone in the US to try for free. Verizon and
AT&T customers can also try the service for free. T-Mobile customers
will pay $15 per month after the free testing period ($10 for
customers who participated in the beta trial) while other customers
will pay $20 a month per line. The service will be included in
T-Mobile's Go5G Next plan.

 GYROSCOPE-ON-A-CHIP TARGETS GPS' DOMINANCE (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Anello Photonics and OSCP showcased their gyroscope-based navigation
systems at CES earlier this year. Anello's devices, which can fit in
the palm of a person's hand, deliver high precision for multiple
applications. OSCP's multi-gyroscope inertial measurement units
provide location accuracy to within centimeters. These systems are
designed to work alongside GPS as a fallback in case GPS interference
is detected. 

 CHINESE SCIENTISTS CREATED MICE WITH 2 DADS — AND THEY SURVIVED TO
ADULTHOOD (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Scientists in China have unveiled a new method for breeding mice with
two male parents - the resulting babies can survive to adulthood. It
is not the first time scientists have bred mice with two dads, but
previous attempts did not result in mice that could live to adulthood.
The resulting mice had deficits, including shorter lifespans and
infertility. The research could result in a better understanding of
imprinting disorders, potentially paving the way to treatments that
use gene editing to fix them in humans.

 YOU ARE USING CURSOR AI INCORRECTLY... (17 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Cursor has a powerful feature called Cursor Rules. It allows
developers to build out a standard library of thousands of prompts
rules and then compose them together like Unix pipes. Cursor itself
can be used to write and update rules. This article goes over how to
use Cursor Rules with examples. 

 PATTERNS FOR BUILDING REALTIME FEATURES (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Realtime features share changes triggered by one user to other users
as the changes are happening. This typically means servers need to
send data to a set of clients that don't know they are missing data.
This post contains a collection of patterns for building realtime
features that rely on a connection between the client and server,
where the server can notify the client of some data. The connection
can be anything that allows the server to send data to the client
without the client knowing that there is new data.

 THE ANTHROPIC ECONOMIC INDEX (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Anthropic Economic Index is an initiative aimed at understanding
AI's effects on labor markets and the economy over time. The Index's
reports provide data and analysis based on millions of anonymized
conversations on Claude.ai. It paints a clear picture of how AI is
being incorporated into real-world tasks across the modern economy.
Usage is concentrated on software development and technical tasks. AI
use leans towards augmentation - its use is more prevalent for tasks
associated with mid-to-high wage occupations but lower for both the
lowest- and highest-paid roles. 

 THREE OBSERVATIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The intelligence of an AI model increases with the resources used to
train and run it - it appears that it is possible to spend arbitrary
amounts of money and get continuous and predictable gains. The cost to
use a given level of AI falls about 10x every 12 months. The
socioeconomic value of linearly increasing intelligence is
super-exponential.
