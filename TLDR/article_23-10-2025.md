 CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED TESTING
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 GOOGLE HAS A USEFUL QUANTUM ALGORITHM THAT OUTPERFORMS A
SUPERCOMPUTER (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google has published a paper describing a computational approach that
demonstrates a quantum advantage compared to current algorithms. The
effort centers around a concept called 'quantum echoes', a series of
operations on the hardware qubits that make up the machine. Using the
approach, Google researchers completed a task using quantum computing
that could have been done on classical hardware, demonstrating quantum
utility. Google has several quantum algorithms in the pipeline, so
more announcements are expected soon. 

 META CUTS 600 JOBS IN AI DIVISION (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Meta is cutting about 600 jobs in its AI division, mainly in teams
focused on artificial-intelligence products, infrastructure, and
long-term AI research. The TBD lab won't be affected. There will be no
changes to the broader Meta Superintelligence Labs structure. Most of
the affected employees will have the opportunity to be redeployed to
other jobs at Meta.

 NEW BITCOIN PROTOCOL MAKES PAYMENTS EASIER (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Arkade is a new upper-layer network protocol built on the Bitcoin
blockchain that enables more user-friendly payments and extended
financial use cases. Many view the protocol as the most important
Bitcoin protocol rollout since the Lightning Network back in 2018.
Arkade mixes the benefits of the Bitcoin network's inherently
decentralized and non-custodial nature with the ease of use and speed
of centralized fintech systems. It can be used for a variety of
financial use cases, such as lending and trading. 

 THE WORLD NEEDS MORE SPACEPORTS. OMAN WANTS TO HELP (18 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 There are no commercial spaceports in the Middle East or Africa.
Oman's geography makes it a uniquely suitable location in the region
for a spaceport. It is aiming to join the small number of countries
that possess the facilities to launch objects into space by 2027. If
all goes according to plan, the spaceport will launch everything from
small suborbital rockets to superheavy behemoths into space.

orchestrate AI across your SDLC. Get a demo [14]

 SCRIPTS I WROTE THAT I USE ALL THE TIME (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This post contains a collection of personal scripts from a developer.
The scripts help streamline the developer's workflow. For example, one
script creates shell files, makes them executable, adds some Bash
prefixes, and then opens them in an editor, making it quick to create
working shell scripts. The scripts span multiple categories, including
Clipboard, Internet, Text processing, and Process management. 

 ENGINEERING MANAGERS SHOULD (SOMETIMES) WRITE CODE (5 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Engineering managers should still write code because it helps keep
their mental model of software development fresh. Staying completely
away from code as a manager means letting your knowledge calcify
around how things worked the last time you regularly wrote production
code. The key is knowing when it is helpful versus when it becomes a
bottleneck. It is fine to brush up on an intern's feature after
they've moved on, but becoming the only person who can deploy releases
is definitely a problem.

 AI WORKERS ARE PUTTING IN 100-HOUR WORKWEEKS TO WIN THE NEW TECH ARMS
RACE (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Top AI researchers and executives are regularly working 80 to 100
hours a week. They see their work as critical to a seminal moment in
history. Many are motivated by the intense competition with rivals and
their own curiosity about model possibilities. Some are now
multimillionaires, but they don't have time to spend their fortunes. 

 BIG COMPANIES V. STARTUPS (40 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Big companies and startups are both dysfunctional, just in different
ways. Figure out what the relevant trade-offs are and what kind of
dysfunction you want to sign up for. It's more important to have a
manager who has your back, a team that works well together, and
interesting projects. The difference between types of companies is
smaller than the differences between companies of the same type.
