 NVIDIA ANNOUNCES NEW AI CHIPS MONTHS AFTER LATEST LAUNCH AS MARKET
COMPETITION HEATS UP (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nvidia has unveiled a new generation of artificial intelligence chip
architecture called Rubin. The company only just announced its
upcoming Blackwell model in March - those chips are still in
production and expected to ship to customers later in 2024. Nvidia has
pledged to release new AI chip models on a one-year rhythm. The
less-than-three-month turnaround from Blackwell to Rubin underscores
the competitive frenzy in the AI chip market. 

 SPACEX AIMS TO LAUNCH CELLULAR STARLINK SERVICE THIS FALL (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 SpaceX has revealed plans to launch its Starlink system for phones
this fall in a filing about the FCC's new rules on supplying satellite
connectivity to US carriers. The company says that the FCC's current
framework for supplying satellite connectivity to phones is too
restrictive and has urged the agency to loosen the aggregate limit on
radio frequencies for cellular satellites, specifically the
‚Äúone-size-fits-all aggregate out-of-band power flux-density.‚Äù It
backs replacing the restriction with more granular band-specific
limits. SpaceX's rivals have lobbied the Commission to maintain the
restriction to protect against potential radio interference.

 WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH A ROBOTIC THIRD THUMB? (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 'The Third Thumb' is a 3D-printed robotic wearable designed to
enhance users' biological capabilities. Controlled by users' toes, the
robotic thumb sits on the side of the palm opposite users' biological
thumbs, resembling a sixth elongated finger. It is operated through a
pair of sensors under each big toe - pressure applied by the right toe
moves the thumb side to side, while pressure from the left toe moves
it up and down. The device can be used to complete tasks that would
ordinarily be difficult or impossible to perform with just a thumb and
fingers. A video demonstrating what The Third Thumb can do is
available in the article. 

 AI IS CRACKING A HARD PROBLEM ‚Äì GIVING COMPUTERS A SENSE OF SMELL
(6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Smell in humans is experienced through about 400 types of receptors
in the nose. Scientists are using machine learning to help computers
learn what certain molecules or sets of molecules smell like to
humans. Machine learning is key to digitizing smells because it can
learn to map the molecular structure of an odor-causing compound to
textual odor descriptors. Dataset sizes have grown significantly in
the past few years, allowing researchers to finally apply machine
learning to machine olfaction. The technology has promising
applications such as personalized perfumes and fragrances, better
insect repellents, novel chemical sensors, early detection of
diseases, and more realistic augmented reality experiences.

 AN INTERVIEW WITH THE MOST PROLIFIC JAILBREAKER OF CHATGPT AND OTHER
LEADING LLMS (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Pliny the Prompter posted a jailbreak for OpenAI's newest foundation
model, GPT-4o, just a few hours after it was released. The jailbreak
allowed users to get the model to output explicit copyrighted lyrics,
instructions for making banned items, strategic plans for attacks, and
medical advice based on X-rays. Pliny has been finding jailbreaks for
leading large language models for around 9 months. This article
contains an interview with the prompter where they discuss what
motivates them, their approach to jailbreaking a new model, legal
ramifications from AI jailbreaking, jailbreaking ethics, and more. 

 WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM A YEAR OF BUILDING WITH LLMS (45 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Building with AI is now more accessible than ever, but it can still
be difficult to build products and systems that are effective beyond a
demo. This guide teaches readers how to build successful products with
large language models. It draws from the authors' experiences of
building applications with LLMs over the past year. The guide
discusses tactics, operations, and strategies for building with LLMs.

 THE INTERNET'S FINAL FRONTIER: REMOTE AMAZON TRIBES (20 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 SpaceX's Starlink has been making the internet accessible to
previously isolated tribes in Brazil since 2022. This article looks at
what happened to the Marubo tribe, a community that has preserved its
way of life for hundreds of years through isolation, after it gained
access to the internet. While everyone in the tribe was happy when the
technology arrived as the internet brought clear benefits, such as the
ability to chat with faraway loved ones and call for help in
emergencies, people in the tribe feel things have gotten worse. The
internet has become essential to the tribe, but at a cost. 

 THE ART OF SCALING TASTE (24 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Startups can survive extremely competitive environments by having
good taste. Taste is how a business differentiates itself when
attention is scarce and choice is abundant. Knowing what to make is
just as important as the ability to make it. MSCHF is a business that
has managed to scale its taste without compromising on it. This
article looks at how the company releases so many products while
staying through to its original vision, how it keeps its team creative
and engaged, and lessons from the company that can be applied by
anyone.
