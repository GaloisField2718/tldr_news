 IOS 18.4 WILL BRING APPLE INTELLIGENCE-POWERED ‘PRIORITY
NOTIFICATIONS' (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The iOS 18.4 beta adds a new 'Priority Notifications' feature.
Powered by Apple Intelligence, the feature is designed to help users
manage notifications by prioritizing important alerts and minimizing
distractions from less important ones. Priority Notifications will be
displayed in a separate section on the iPhone's Lock Screen. Users
will still be able to swipe to view all of their notifications. The
feature will be off by default but can be enabled through the
Notifications section in Settings. 

 MICROSOFT OUTSOURCES OPENAI'S AMBITIONS TO SOFTBANK (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The announcement around the Stargate project made it clear that
Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI was to evolve, allowing OpenAI to
use other cloud providers. Microsoft is not fully breaking up with
OpenAI - it will remain a key partner in many regards. However, what
was a tight coupling of OpenAI and Microsoft will now be a tight
coupling of OpenAI and SoftBank.

 HOW TO MAKE SUPERBABIES (64 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Genetic technology could create humans that live longer, have the raw
intellectual power to do Nobel Prize-worthy scientific research, and
very rarely suffer from health disorders. Scientists don't do this
though due to ethical issues. As a result, there is a lot of
low-hanging fruit in this field of research. This post looks into how
to do large-scale, heritable editing of the human genome to improve
everything from diabetes risk to intelligence. It summarizes the state
of knowledge in the field and lays out a technical roadmap that
examines how remaining barriers may be overcome. 

 EARTH'S 1ST ASTEROID MINING PROSPECTOR HEADS TO THE LAUNCHPAD (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AstroForge is planning to heave a microwave oven-sized spacecraft
toward an asteroid later this week as part of the company's plans to
create a future where precious metals are mined around the solar
system. Its Odin spacecraft will launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as
soon as Wednesday. Odin's target is an object called 2022 OB5, which
is about the size of a football field and is likely to contain a high
amount of metal. Odin will arrive in late 2025 after a journey of
about 300 days.

 HOW TO BUILD AN LLM CHAT APP: THE NEW LITMUS TEST FOR JUNIOR DEVS (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Building an LLM (Large Language Model) chat app is way more
complicated than just making an API call. There are many
considerations required - building an LLM chat app is the gauntlet
that separates the juniors from the devs who actually know what they
are doing. This article discusses how to start building a scalable LLM
chat app. Learning how to build the backend architecture allows
developers to build better apps that can handle more users and dodge
the shame of a launch-day crash.

 WHY I THINK AI TAKE-OFF IS RELATIVELY SLOW (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A large part of the economy just won't adopt AI or use it effectively
all that quickly. As AI becomes more productive, human bottlenecks
will become more important. Not all bottlenecks will be regulatory:
there will be slow adopters, people in the workplace who hate AI,
energy constraints, and other factors. It is the worst performer who
sets the overall level of productivity - soon, the worst performer
will be humans. While AI could boost economic rates, that reality will
still be a few decades out, if it happens. 

 THE PROFITABLE STARTUP (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The thinking that startups should prioritize growth over everything
else, even profitability, was always flawed - profitability isn't
unambitious. It means not relying on investors for survival and being
able to focus on an unaltered vision and mission. It's now easy to be
profitable while also growing fast. The factor holding founders back
is rarely team size - it's the clarity of their focus, skill, and
ability to execute. Measure what matters, understand your risk
profile, hire intentionally and slowly, and raise on your own terms.
