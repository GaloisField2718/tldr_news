 INSIDE APPLE'S MASSIVE PUSH TO TRANSFORM THE MAC INTO A GAMING
PARADISE (20 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's hardware can finally go toe to toe with some of the best PCs.
The company is now aiming to make another attempt at becoming a gaming
powerhouse. Its previous attempt in 1999 did not go so well. Now,
Apple has larger and more capable teams with plenty of resources, and
the company is used to playing the long game. This article looks at
Apple's history with gaming, its hardware developments in recent
years, and the company's push to make its systems more game-friendly. 

 AMAZON PLANS TO MAKE ITS OWN HYDROGEN TO POWER VEHICLES (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Amazon plans to produce hydrogen fuel at its fulfillment centers. It
has partnered with hydrogen company Plug Power to install an
electrolyzer at a fulfillment center in Aurora, Colorado. The
electrolyzer, which uses electricity to split water molecules to
produce hydrogen, has the capacity to fuel up to 400 hydrogen fuel
cell-powered forklifts. Amazon says that hydrogen is an important tool
in its efforts to decarbonize its operations by 2040.

 THE FIRST EV WITH A LITHIUM-FREE SODIUM BATTERY HITS THE ROAD IN
JANUARY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 JAC Motors is launching an electric vehicle with a sodium-ion battery
through its Yiwei brand. Sodium-ion batteries have lower density than
lithium-ion batteries, but their lower cost, more abundant supplies,
and superior cold-weather performance make them viable for mass EV
adoption. The Yiwei EV will have a 252 km range with a 25 kWh
capacity. Deliveries of the vehicle will begin in January. 

 A GAME-CHANGING VACCINE COULD LOWER 'BAD' CHOLESTEROL BY 30% (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have been able to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
levels using a vaccine based on a non-infectious virus particle that
targets a protein known to have an important relationship to LDLs.
LDLs can cause dangerous blockages in the arteries, reducing oxygen
flow to the heart or causing blood clots that can lead to a stroke.
The vaccine was able to reduce the bad cholesterol by up to 30% in
animal models. It will still be a while before the technology can be
used in humans, but it promises a solution that would be more
affordable than current options and last around a year per dose.

 MAKE ETHEREUM CYPHERPUNK AGAIN (21 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post by Vitalik Buterin takes a look at the core values of the
crypto movement and how they have changed. Crypto isn't just about
creating isolated tools and games - it's about building holistically
toward a more free and open society and economy where the
technological, social, and economic parts fit into each other. web3
had a similar vision to build a set of technology that could together
form the base layer of a more open internet stack. Unfortunately,
these visions have faded somewhat into the background. 

 WHY MASIMO THOUGHT IT COULD TAKE ON APPLE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple and medical device maker Masimo have been entrenched in a legal
battle over a single feature on the Apple Watch for over three years.
Masimo had sued a startup on similar grounds in 2018 and won. Both
cases involved employees who helped the companies develop similar
technologies. The International Trade Commission's US import on
Apple's watches was quickly paused on appeal. The US Customs and
Border Protection will make a decision on January 12 on whether the
changes Apple made to the watches are significant enough to avoid a
patent dispute.
