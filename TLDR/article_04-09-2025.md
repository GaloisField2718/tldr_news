 HOW CURSOR STOPS FAKE ACCOUNTS FROM ABUSING FREE TRIALS (SPONSOR) [4]


 Free trials help AI apps grow, but they also attract abuse. Fake
accounts steal tokens, drain compute, and disrupt real users.

Cursor, the fast-growing AI code assistant, uses WorkOS Radar [5] to
detect and stop abuse in real time. Radar runs silently in the
background, using device fingerprinting and behavioral signals to
block fraud before it reaches your app.

 APPLE PLANS AI-POWERED WEB SEARCH TOOL FOR SIRI TO RIVAL OPENAI,
PERPLEXITY (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is planning to launch its own AI-powered search tool next year.
It is working on a new system that will be integrated into the Siri
voice assistant. The underlying technology could come from Google -
the companies recently reached a formal agreement for Apple to
evaluate and test a Google-developed AI model. The company may
eventually add the technology to its Safari web browser and Spotlight.


 TESLA'S NEXT-GEN OPTIMUS PROTOTYPE WITH GROK REVEALED (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently posted a new video of Tesla's
next-generation Optimus robot on X. The video shows a new Optimus
prototype answering questions and taking some very robotic steps. The
prototype, which sports a new gold color, uses Grok for additional
utility. The video is available in the article.

 AMAZON'S STARLINK RIVAL, PROJECT KUIPER, DEMOS 1 GIGABIT DOWNLOADS (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Amazon's Project Kuiper team has posted a video showing the satellite
internet service delivering a 1,280 Mbps download rate. The
constellation currently has over 100 satellites in orbit, with more
set to launch in the coming weeks and months. The speed record was
achieved using Kuiper's upcoming enterprise-grade customer terminal -
the standard Kuiper dish promises max download speeds of 400 Mbps.
Starlink is also preparing to offer gigabit speeds. It recently
introduced a new upgraded dish for enterprises. 

 IN A FIRST, SCIENTISTS MAP COMPLETE BRAIN ACTIVITY DURING
DECISION-MAKING (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have mapped decision-making at a single-cell resolution
across an entire mouse brain. The effort by the International Brain
Laboratory, a global consortium of 22 labs, was coordinated by three
Princeton labs. The experimental setup involved making mice move tiny
steering wheels to control shapes on a screen while recording neural
activity using high-density electrodes. The work showed that
decision-making is very broadly distributed throughout the brain,
including in regions previously thought not to be involved. The
coordination of 22 labs worldwide demonstrates the power of
large-scale neuroscience.

 SEEING LIKE A SOFTWARE COMPANY (21 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Thinking in terms of legibility and illegibility explains many of the
things that are confusing about large software companies. It explains
why companies do many things that seem obviously counter-productive,
why the rules in practice are so often out of sync with the rules as
written, and why companies are surprisingly willing to tolerate
rule-breaking in some contexts. Increasing legibility often lowers
efficiency, but its benefits are high enough that organizations are
typically willing to do so regardless. Both the legible and illegible
are important - the legible allows organizations to do things that
would otherwise be impossible, while the illegible allows for
high-efficiency work. 

 ON EVALUATING AGENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 No amount of evals will replace the need to look at the data. It's
really difficult and time-intensive to evaluate agents' outputs when
you are trying to validate complex conversation patterns. Stop relying
solely on manual testing and create evals for agents. Tools help
simplify things, but you still have to look at the data and build
evaluations for your use case. Don't rely solely on standard evals -
build your own.

 AI WILL CHANGE HOW WE BUILD STARTUPS -- BUT HOW? (12 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Most people's phone home screens probably currently don't have a lot
of AI-native apps, particularly beyond the obvious LLM apps. This
demonstrates an enormous opportunity, as it shows how people haven't
really started changing the way they work using AI. AI will change the
way we build startups, but it's not yet clear how that will happen.
This article looks at historical precedents and other factors to try
to predict how AI will change things. The best-case scenario is a
world where AI enables fewer people to produce more. 

 GOOGLE FASTSEARCH IS FASTER THAN GOOGLE SEARCH (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google FastSearch is a technology used by Gemini for grounding
purposes. It is faster than Google Search but retrieves fewer results,
which can result in lower quality results, but it's good enough for
grounding. FastSearch is not directly available to third parties. It
is integrated into Vertex AI, which is available to third parties -
Vertex customers do not receive FastSearch-ranked web results, only
the information from those results.
