SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SCIENTISTS BUILD YEAST WITH ARTIFICIAL DNA IN A MAJOR SYNTHETIC
BIOLOGY ADVANCE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Scientists have created synthetic versions of the 16 chromosomes in a
yeast cell and successfully combined some of them in one cell. The
feat is a key step towards creating programmable cellular factories.
It also revealed sequences in genes that interrupted a key process in
cells that led to mitochondria dysfunction. The team is now working to
combine all the chromosomes into one cell that can survive. If
successful, the technology could be used to produce biofuels,
medicines, and other materials using cells. 

 AI THAT READS BRAIN SCANS SHOWS PROMISE FOR FINDING ALZHEIMER‚ÄôS
GENES (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed AI-based approaches for shifting through
genomes to identify genes linked to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The
combination of genomics, brain imaging, and AI allows researchers to
find indicators that are tightly linked to a genomic driver.
Scientists have had access to massive research databases for decades,
but sifting through this data has proven to be a challenge. AI is able
to sort through and learn from the data more efficiently and produce
consistent results. If the approach works, it could also be applied to
other diseases that have a physical presentation in brain imaging.
