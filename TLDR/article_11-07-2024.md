 OPENAI BOARD SHAKE-UP: MICROSOFT OUT, APPLE BACKS AWAY AMID AI
PARTNERSHIP SCRUTINY (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Microsoft and Apple will no longer have representatives in non-voting
observer roles on OpenAI's board. Microsoft withdrew from the role
while Apple opted not to take the position. OpenAI plans to update
business partners and investors through regular meetings instead of
board representation. The changes are likely a reaction to regulators
in the EU and US increasing their scrutiny of Big Tech's investments
in AI startups due to concerns about stifling competition.

 MUSK SAYS NEXT NEURALINK BRAIN IMPLANT EXPECTED SOON, DESPITE ISSUES
WITH THE FIRST PATIENT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Neuralink plans to implant its system into a second patient within
the next few weeks. The company is aiming to implant its device in
'high single digits' of patients this year. While only around 15% of
the channels in the first patient are still functional, the patient is
still about to use the device to watch videos, read, and play chess or
other video games, sometimes up to 70 hours per week. Neuralink will
be making changes to address the hardware problems it encountered with
its first participant, with a focus on mitigating retraction. 

 NEW HIV PREVENTION DRUG SHOWS 100% EFFICACY IN CLINICAL TRIAL (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A twice-yearly injection of a new pre-exposure prophylaxis drug was
shown to provide young women total protection from HIV infection in a
large clinical trial performed in South Africa and Uganda. The drug,
lenacapavir, works by interfering with the protein shell that protects
HIV's genetic material and the enzymes needed for replication. Gilead
Sciences plans to submit the drug for approval with a number of
country regulators within the next couple of months. It will offer
licenses to companies that make generic drugs to help get prices down.

 BIG TECH JOBS ARE NOT WHAT THEY WERE (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Today's big tech job options offer great compensation, incredible
platforms for scale and impact, and slow but consistent growth over
time. However, the kind of growth most companies experienced over the
last few decades simply cannot happen again, rocket-ride careers are
largely over, and there is increasing bureaucracy in the industry.
Most of big tech is still laying off or not hiring and there is
increasing return to office pressure. Working with big tech would suit
people looking for stability, new graduates, and those looking for a
path to retirement. Those who can afford higher risk, people who have
already received credentials from a big tech job, and anyone who
cannot stand being part of a large, slow system should look elsewhere.
