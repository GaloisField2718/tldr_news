 OPENAI ANNOUNCES SEARCHGPT, ITS AI-POWERED SEARCH ENGINE (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has announced a prototype of an AI-powered search engine with
real-time access to information across the internet. SearchGPT can
summarize findings and answer questions about queries. It will only be
accessible to 10,000 test users at launch. OpenAI is working with
third-party partners and using direct content feeds to build its
search results. 

 GOOGLE CLAIMS MATH BREAKTHROUGH WITH PROOF-SOLVING AI MODELS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google DeepMind's AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 AI systems
reportedly solved four out of the six problems from this year's
International Mathematical Olympiad. AlphaProof uses reinforcement
learning to train itself while AlphaGeometry 2 is powered by a
Gemini-based language model. While the achievement is significant, the
programs needed a lot more time to solve the problems than human
contestants, and some of the problems needed to be manually translated
by humans before the AI could understand them.

 A TWICE-YEARLY INJECTION OFFERS 100% PROTECTION AGAINST HIV, STUDY
SUGGESTS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Results from a recent study on Sunlenca, an HIV preventive injection,
found it provided 100% protection against the disease. There were no
infections among the 5,000 female study participants who received the
shots. The shots still need to be tested in men before the drugmaker
Gilead will seek permission to use it as a protection against
infection. Sunlenca is already approved as a treatment for HIV in the
US, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere. Gilead will pursue a voluntary
licensing program that will allow a select number of generic producers
to make the drug. 

 THE US NUCLEAR INDUSTRY IS STUCK. CAN THIS STARTUP GET IT ROLLING
AGAIN? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Nuclear Company came out of stealth last week by announcing its
aim to deploy a 6-gigawatt nuclear fission reactor fleet by the
mid-2030s. 6 gigawatts is more nuclear-generating capacity than the US
has deployed in the last decade. The company plans to use proven
licensed technology to construct a series of reactors across the US.
Its founders believe that the slow deployment of nuclear power in the
US is partly due to the industry's own making as it focuses too much
on first-of-a-kind constructions rather than on a repeatable,
fleet-scale approach.

 --EXPERIMENTAL-STRIP-TYPES (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The --experimental-strip-types flag in Node.js makes it possible to
execute TypeScript files. While Node.js can transpile TypeScript
source code into JavaScript source code, no type checking is performed
during the transpilation process and types are discarded. Enum,
namespaces, and other features are not supported as no transformations
are performed. 

 STACKED PRS FOR GITHUB (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This repository contains a command-line tool that helps create
multiple GitHub pull requests at once. It creates a stacked order of
dependencies so that related changes can be grouped together, making
them easier to review. Developers can specify custom commit ranges for
stacks.

 THE AI BOYFRIEND BUSINESS IS BOOMING (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A growing number of women are seeking connection and comfort in
relationships with chatbots, challenging assumptions about the nature
of human intimacy. AI companion apps are surging in popularity.
Engagement on these apps is unusually high, with an average number of
user sessions per month over ten times that of general assistant apps.
Critics of these apps say that they could potentially further erode
human relationships and that users' privacy could be at risk. 

 ELON MUSK WILL ‚ÄòDISCUSS' TESLA INVESTING $5 BILLION IN HIS PRIVATE
AI COMPANY (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Elon Musk and Tesla's board are currently being sued for breach of
fiduciary duty due to xAI. Musk started xAI despite claiming that
Tesla is an AI company. The lawsuit cites a talent acquisition issue,
Musk's threat to not build AI products at Tesla if he doesn't get 25%
control over the company, and the fact that Musk diverted H100
processors meant for Tesla to xAI. It is asking for Musk to transfer
his shares of xAI to Tesla along with other damages. Musk is currently
trying to get Tesla's board to approve a $5 billion investment into
xAI.
