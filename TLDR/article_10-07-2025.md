 INSIDE A NEUROSCIENTIST'S QUEST TO CURE COMA (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Neuroscientist Daniel Toker, a postdoctoral fellow at the Department
of Neurology at UCLA, is on a quest to understand the neurobiology of
unconsciousness. He says consciousness and unconsciousness are deeply
intertwined - and we still don't really know what it means to be
conscious. Unconsciousness is a common endpoint for a lot of
conditions, so it's easier to study scientifically and also medically
important. Toker's grandest aim is to cure coma and other disorders of
consciousness, such as the vegetative state.
