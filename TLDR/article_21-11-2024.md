 THE DEVELOPER'S GUIDE TO FINE-GRAINED AUTHORIZATION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In role-based access control (RBAC), each user has a role, each app
section has a permission, and you're checking the user has the right
to do what they're doing on every action or page load.

Sounds reasonable enough? The problem is that apps have gotten much
more complicated, and contain a lot more user input, making RBAC
implementations complicated and unwieldy. This has led to the rise of
Fine Grained Authorization (FGA) [4].

This blog post [4] covers:

 	* FGA basics and data model
 	* Building resolver logic
 	* Centralized vs decentralized FGA
 	* Frontend considerations
 	* FGA and IdPs

 The Federal Aviation Administration has indicated that it will grant
SpaceX permission to increase the number of Starship launches in South

launches in 2025. 

 SCIENTISTS IDENTIFY TOMATO GENES TO TWEAK FOR SWEETER FRUIT (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Scientists in China have created gene-edited versions of domesticated
tomatoes that are large but also sweet. They had identified two genes
that stop sugar production during ripening. Preventing these genes
from working properly increased sugar content in fruits by up to 30%
compared to unmodified plants. The new tomatoes could be in
supermarkets within three to five years.

 AWS LAMBDA TURNS 10: A RARE LOOK AT THE DOC THAT STARTED IT (32
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Amazon has an expectation that, regardless of role or seniority, if
you have a good idea, you put pen to paper and craft a compelling
narrative. Writing forces authors to be clear, precise, and detailed.
The strategy of writing down good ideas is a proven method that can
produce great products. This article contains a slightly modified
version of the document that launched one of AWS' foundational
services, Lambda. Many things have changed since the document was
written as the service has evolved quite a bit in the last decade.

 HOW GOOGLE SPENT 15 YEARS CREATING A CULTURE OF CONCEALMENT (15
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google systematically told employees to destroy messages, avoid
certain words, and copy lawyers into communications as often as
possible in an attempt to avoid antitrust suits. The company made
deletion the default in its internal communications. This article
looks at how Google developed this distrustful culture. While
companies would like instant messages to be as ephemeral as real-life
conversations, regulators and litigants see them as fair game.
