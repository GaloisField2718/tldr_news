DAWN (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The US Federal Aviation Administration has approved a commercial
launch license for SpaceX's Starship rocket's third test flight. The
test is scheduled for this morning at 7 am CDT, with a launch window
of 110 minutes. SpaceX will target the Indian Ocean for Starship's
slashdown. Details about the changes planned for flight 3 are
available in the article. 

 DID OPENAI JUST ACCIDENTALLY LEAK THE NEXT BIG CHATGPT UPGRADE? (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI appears to have accidentally published a blog post that was
indexed by Bing and DuckDuckGo before it was quickly taken down. The
post was an announcement for GPT-4.5 Turbo, a new model that surpasses
GPT-4 Turbo in speed, accuracy, and scalability. The cached
description mentions a knowledge cutoff date of June 2024 and a 256k
context window. OpenAI has not commented on the leak.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 FIGURE 01 CAN NOW HAVE FULL CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE (1 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Figure has implemented OpenAI's technology to allow its robots to
have full conversations with people. OpenAI's models provide
high-level visual and language intelligence while Figure's neural
networks deliver fast, low-level dexterous robot actions. This X post
contains a video showing a person talking to a Figure robot and
getting it to perform tasks, explain the reasoning behind the tasks,
and self-assess on how the tasks went. 

 MINING HELIUM-3 ON THE MOON HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOREVER‚ÄîNOW A
COMPANY WILL TRY (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Interlune, a company that has been operating in stealth since its
founding by two of Blue Origin's earliest employees in 2022, aims to
extract helium-3 from the Moon. The company recently came out of
stealth with an announcement that it has raised another $15 million.
While the funding is relatively small, its implications are
potentially large. Most lunar efforts are focused on providing
services to NASA, but Interlune's goal directly derives value from
extracting resources on the Moon.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 A COLLECTION OF DESIGN ENGINEERS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The design engineer is someone who sits at the intersection of design
and engineering and works to bridge the gap between them. They know
how to run a design process and have the engineering chops to
implement it. This allows them to quickly iterate on ideas - their
skillset is ideal for prototyping, exploratory interaction design, and
building robust design systems. This blog post contains a list of
people who are considered design engineers to more fully illustrate
what the role entails. 

 DEVELOPERS ARE ON EDGE (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Layoffs are still dragging on and industry veterans are finding it
hard to get a callback from recruiters. However, wage gains secured
during the good days are still massive, despite what inflation has
eroded over the last few years. Developers are still looking mighty
privileged compared to premium programmers from a decade ago. AI will
have a huge impact on the industry - no profession has ever
successfully resisted automation or redundancy in the face of
technological advancement over the long term.

 THE END OF THE MRBEAST ERA (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MrBeast's influence on YouTube can be seen everywhere, from the types
of content people make to the brisk editing styles populating all of
YouTube's trending content to even the way YouTubers style their video
thumbnails. Copycats can be seen all over the platform. While it is
unlikely that MrBeast will be dethroned anytime soon, there are signs
that people are growing fatigued with sensationalism and are hungry
for authenticity and relatability. 

 WHY META COULD FINALLY HAVE ITS ANDROID MOMENT (72 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Vision Pro may just be an over-engineered devkit. There is some
genius and audacity behind some of Apple's hardware decisions - gaze
and pinch was a major industry 'a-ha' moment. However, the device's
software/content story is dull and unimaginative and most people
likely won't use the Vision Pro for watching media. The Vision Pro's
debut was the best thing that ever happened to Meta's Quest brand as
it elevated VR to a level of mainstream consumer curiosity, set new
standards and pricing envelopes for VR devices, and created a
competitor for Meta teams to chase.
