 FOLDABLE IPHONE'S DISPLAY SIZES LEAKED (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple will likely launch its foldable iPhone in the second half of
2026. The device will come with a 7.8-inch inner display and a
5.5-inch outer display. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has an 8-inch
inner screen and a 6.5-inch outer screen. Apple's foldable iPhone will
feature a 'crease-free' inner display and have two rear cameras, one
front camera, and a Touch ID power button instead of Face ID. 

 OPENAI AGREED TO PAY ORACLE $30B A YEAR FOR DATA CENTER SERVICES (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Oracle disclosed in an SEC filing last month that it had signed a
cloud deal that would generate $30 billion a year in revenue. The
company that signed that deal has been revealed to be OpenAI. Oracle
collectively sold $24.5 billion worth of cloud services in its fiscal
2025 to all customers combined. OpenAI and Oracle still have to build
the data center, which will be a costly endeavor.

 DEEPMIND'S QUEST FOR SELF-IMPROVING TABLE TENNIS AGENTS (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Google DeepMind recently used table tennis as a testbed for its
technology, as the sport requires robots to master a confluence of
difficult skills - it requires perception and demands exceptionally
precise control. This makes table tennis an ideal domain for
developing and evaluating robust learning algorithms that can handle
real-time interaction, complex physics, high-level reasoning, and the
need for adaptive strategies. This article looks at the study and the
insights gained from it. One important lesson learned from the project
is that VLMs can be leveraged for explainable robot policy search. 

 GENETICS REIMAGINED (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Scientists recently confirmed the healthy births of children through
mitochondrial donation. The innovation opens new doors for
reproductive choice. It offers at-risk families a viable path to
parenthood without the lingering fear of passing on devastating
inherited conditions. However, it also opens up the possibility of
designer genetics that will be passed down to future generations.
Those currently living with conditions will still face daily
challenges, but for the next generation, the landscape has changed.

 ANY-AGENT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 any-agent is a Python library that provides a single interface for
evaluating different agent frameworks. It can be used to create and
evaluate agents, implement and use custom callbacks, integrate Model
Context Protocol tools, deploy agents with Agent-to-Agent
communication, and more. Tutorials on how to get started are
available. 

 VIBECODING A HIGH PERFORMANCE SYSTEM (24 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This developer recently used agentic coding to build a system to
crawl a billion web pages in around 24 hours. Less than 4% of the code
was written by hand. The post discusses how AI helped code the tool
and where it fell short. AI was a huge boost during the development
process. Some of the learnings from this project could also apply to
building other high-performance systems.

 HOW APPLE'S INTERNAL VETO AGAINST OPEN-SOURCE AI SPARKED A TALENT
EXODUS TO META (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple had a plan to open-source its core AI models, but its
leadership decided against it due to fears of exposing performance
compromises made for on-device processing, a pivotal decision that has
ignited a crisis of confidence within the company's AI division. The
move has directly triggered an exodus of top talent to rivals like
Meta. Many engineers are frustrated with the internal conflict between
Apple's famous secrecy and the open culture of AI research. There are
now serious doubts over the future of Apple Intelligence and the
company's ability to compete in the AI arms race.
