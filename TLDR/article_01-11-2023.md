 VIRTUAL SUPERLENSING MADE A REALITY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Superlensing is a way to see things that are smaller than the
wavelength of light. Two researchers from the University of Sydney
Nano Institute recently developed a superlensing technique that
doesn't require any actual lenses. They achieved this by using
calculations on electromagnetic field recordings. While the method is
not the first nor the highest resolution technique available, it is
much faster and less costly than other techniques. 

 OPEN-ACCESS REFORMERS LAUNCH NEXT BOLD PUBLISHING PLAN (11 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A group of influential funding agencies called cOAlition S has been
pushing for change in the scholarly publishing world over the past
five years by pressuring journals to allow immediate open-access
publishing. Its most recent proposal puts forward an even broader

is to make all versions of an article and its associated peer-review
reports be published openly from the outset without the authors paying
any fees and for the authors to decide when and where to first publish
their work.

 YOUTUBE‚ÄôS ANTI-ADBLOCK AND UBLOCK ORIGIN (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 YouTube has recently ramped up its anti-adblock efforts. This article
looks at how YouTube is doing this and the efforts from Redditors and
adblock extension developers to bypass them. While developers are able
to still bypass YouTube's anti-adblocking methods, YouTube will likely
win this war through attrition - there is a limit to how much adblock
developers can take and YouTube has the resources to continue on
forever.
