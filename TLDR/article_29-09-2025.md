 CMOS CLAIM TO BE ALL-IN ON AI, BUT THEIR BUDGETS TELL A DIFFERENT
STORY… (SPONSOR) [4] 

 New research from Contentful surveyed 425 marketing decision makers
(including 103 CMOs) to uncover the reality behind AI adoption in
marketing.

The findings reveal [4] a massive "optimism-execution gap" that's fast
becoming marketing's fault line. While nearly every CMO claims to
prioritize AI, most companies still treat it as an experiment rather
than infrastructure. Learn what separates the winners from the
non-starters:

 	* C-suite perspectives on $500K+ investments reshaping marketing ops
 	* Workflow insights from top performers
 	* Budgeting frameworks for weighing speed/quality/personalization

 APPLE BUILDS A CHATGPT-LIKE APP TO HELP TEST THE REVAMPED SIRI (7
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is currently using an internal ChatGPT-like iPhone app
code-named Veritas to help test and prepare for a Siri overhaul
planned for next year. The app is being used to quickly evaluate new
features, including the ability to search through personal data and
perform in-app actions. The internal tool marks a new phase in Apple's
preparations for the Siri revamp, which could help reshape perceptions
of its AI efforts. 

 META WANTS TO BECOME THE ‘BACKBONE' OF HUMANOID ROBOTS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Meta's chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, recently said in a
meeting that he wants to focus on licensing Meta's software to other
manufacturers instead of being a hardware manufacturer. Meta's new
Superintelligence AI lab is working with the company's robotics group
to build a 'world model' that can do software simulations to animate
dexterous movements. Bosworth says that robotics will be Meta's next
'AR-sized' bet. The company has so far spent over $100 billion in
cumulative investment into its augmented and virtual reality
portfolio.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 EVOLVING THE MULTI-USER SPACEPORT (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SpaceX currently launches and lands its Falcon family of rockets
every two days on average without interrupting the operations of other
launch providers. Launch sites of the future will need to be fully
operationalized like an airport, with multiple launches a day from
multiple providers. SpaceX is working with federal regulators, the
federal ranges, and industry partners to realize this vision. Its
goals will advance the entire launch industry's ability to fly rapidly
and reliably, ideally from multiple locations to increase resilience. 

 WHY TODAY'S HUMANOIDS WON'T LEARN DEXTERITY (52 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Current projects developing humanoid robots will fail at teaching
them dexterity because, in order to succeed, they need both the right
data and for the robots to learn the right thing. Human dexterity
relies on a rich sense of touch, and it often involves elbows, the
front of the body, legs, and feet. Just using visual data is not
enough. In the future, there will likely be a lot of robots with
different forms for different specialized jobs that humans can do.
They won't look human, but they will probably all still be called
humanoid robots.

 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [10] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[11] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [12] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [13] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 WHAT IS "GOOD TASTE" IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING? (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Taste is the ability to adopt the set of engineering values that fit
the current project. It's different from skill - it's possible to be
technically strong but have bad taste or be technically weak with good
taste. Almost every decision in software engineering is a tradeoff.
Often, you have to make tradeoffs between engineering values, such as
resiliency, speed, readability, correctness, and flexibility, and
that's where taste comes in. Bad taste is when your preferred values
are not a good fit for the project. 

 SMALL DATA (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Small Data is a movement away from Big Data toward much simpler and
cheaper solutions. It is being driven by improvements in hardware and
organizations that don't use that much data. Distributed systems are
more overkill than ever. Developers should be considering what
technologies they know well, are good enough, and are the least
toilsome for the task at hand. Modern hardware will likely handle the
workload just fine.

 FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPONENTIAL, AGAIN (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Many people look at the current state of AI, see the mistakes it
makes, and then somehow jump to the conclusion that AI will never be
able to do tasks at a human level. A few years ago, our current AI
models were just science fiction. AI is improving at an exponential
rate. It will be surprising if these improvements suddenly stop. Even
a relatively conservative extrapolation of the trends suggests that by
the end of 2027, models will frequently outperform experts on many
tasks. 

 OPEN SOCIAL (27 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Open source has clearly won, but this wasn't a foregone conclusion 35
years ago. There were many powerful forces that wanted open source to
lose. We are now at a similar juncture with social apps. Projects like
Bluesky's AT Protocol are changing the relationship between the user,
the developer, and the project. What open source did for code, open
social does for data.
