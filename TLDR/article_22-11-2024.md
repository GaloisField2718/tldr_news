 APPLE WORKING ON 'LLM SIRI' FOR 2026 LAUNCH (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is working on a smarter version of Siri that employees are
calling 'LLM Siri'. It will be able to hold ongoing conversations like
OpenAI's ChatGPT. Using large language models will allow Siri to
perform much more complex tasks. The new Siri could be announced as
part of the June Worldwide Developers Conference in 2025. Apple is
aiming for a spring 2026 launch date. 

 WELCOME TO GOOGLE'S NIGHTMARE: US REVEALS PLAN TO DESTROY SEARCH
MONOPOLY (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The US Department of Justice has filed its proposed final judgment in
the antitrust case against Google. The plans require Google to sell
its Chrome browser and retains the option of forcing Google to divest
Android if competition doesn't increase from behavioral remedies. They
include bans on exclusive default deals with other browsers and device
makers and prohibit Google from building new browsers. Google may have
to fund an education campaign showing people how to switch search
engines. The company will have plenty of time to argue against the
proposal as the final revisions are not due until March next year.

 THE KEY MOMENT CAME 38 MINUTES AFTER STARSHIP ROARED OFF THE LAUNCH
PAD (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The only hiccup during SpaceX's sixth Starship test was an abortive
attempt to catch the rocket's Super Heavy booster back on the launch
site. SpaceX demonstrated that Starship can safely deorbit itself on
future missions by reigniting one of its six Raptor engines for a
brief burn to slightly adjust its flight path about 38 minutes after
liftoff. The achievement means that Starship will likely soon be
cleared to travel into orbit, deploy Starlink internet satellites, and
conduct in-space refueling experiments. There will be plenty more
opportunities for booster catches in the coming months as SpaceX plans
to ramp up its launch cadence at Starbase.

 ~9.5% OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERS DO VIRTUALLY NOTHING (4 MINUTE READ) [14]


 Ghost engineers have less than 0.1x the performance of the median
engineer and do virtually no work. Around 14% of software engineers
working remotely do almost no work, compared to 9% in hybrid roles and
6% in the office. While on average, engineers working from the office
perform better, 5x engineers are more common in remote work. Ghost
engineers unfairly burden teams, waste company resources, block jobs
for others, and limit humanity's progress. Removing them from
organizations would save companies large amounts in pay with no
decrease in performance. 

 US JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SEEKS TO UNWIND GOOGLE'S ANTHROPIC DEAL (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The US Justice Department has proposed that Google unwind its
partnership with AI startup Anthropic as part of a resolution for the
landmark antitrust case over online search. Google may be barred from
acquiring, investing in, or collaborating with any company that
controls where consumers search for information. Google says that the
remedy would chill the company's investment in artificial intelligence
and jeopardize the US' global economic and technology leadership at a
time when it's needed most. Anthropic's deal with Amazon is also under
scrutiny.
