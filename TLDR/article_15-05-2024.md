 GOOGLE IS REDESIGNING ITS SEARCH ENGINE ‚Äî AND IT'S AI ALL THE WAY
DOWN (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Billions of Google users will soon see AI-generated summaries at the
top of many of their search results. The AI Overviews are designed to
take out the hard work of searching so users can focus on the
important things. Google announced several other AI-powered features
at its I/O developer conference, such as a feature in Lens that lets
users search by capturing a video, a planning tool that can generate
trip itineraries and meal plans with a single query, and suggestions
within search results. While similar products have come under scrutiny
for summarizing content and not directing users to the actual sources
of information, Google says that early data shows that the new way of
searching will actually lead to more clicks to the open web. 

 OPENAI CHIEF SCIENTIST ILYA SUTSKEVER IS OFFICIALLY LEAVING (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's co-founder and chief scientist, is
officially leaving the company. Sutskever helped lead the coup against
Sam Altman and then later changed his mind. His employment status had
been ambiguous since the ouster. Jakub Pachocki, the company's
director of research, will be OpenAI's new chief scientist.

 WEIGHT LOSS FROM WEGOVY SUSTAINED FOR UP TO FOUR YEARS, TRIAL SHOWS
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A large long-term trial of semaglutide found that early weight loss
from the drug is generally maintained for up to four years, with the
participants in the study receiving weekly injections. The
participants in the study tended to lose weight over the first 65
weeks on the drug but then hit a plateau. Semaglutide reduced
participants' risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular-related
deaths by 20% over the span of a little over three years. 52.4% of
participants who received the drug in the study moved to a lower
category of body mass index during the trial. 

 NEW GEL BREAKS DOWN ALCOHOL IN THE BODY (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A protein-based gel developed by researchers at ETH Zurich can break
down alcohol in the gastrointestinal tract without harming the body.
The gel, made from whey protein fibrils, uses individual iron atoms to
convert alcohol in the intestine into harmless acetic acid. It has
been shown to reduce blood alcohol levels in mice by up to 50%. The
gel is only effective as long as there is still alcohol in the
gastrointestinal tract, so it can't help with alcohol poisoning. While
it has yet to be tested in humans, the researchers are confident it
will be a success, so they have already applied to patent the gel.

 AIS SOUND HUMAN NOW... AND ITS ALREADY BEING USED FOR PHONE CALLS...
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 Bland AI's recently-released AI phone agent [9] is blowing everyone's
mind. It can respond at human level speed and precision with any voice
[9] _‚Äî_ potentially replacing a large % of phone-based tasks humans
are doing today: sales, customer support, SDR, and more. Try calling
it yourself [9] or sign up for something even crazier‚Ä¶ [10] 

 PROJECT IDX, GOOGLE'S NEXT-GEN IDE, IS NOW IN OPEN BETA (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Project IDX is an AI-centric, browser-based development environment
that was launched as an invite-only service in August. Over 100,000
developers have already tried the service, which is now available in
open beta. Google has added an integration with the Google Maps
Platform into the IDE and integrations with the Chrome Dev Tools and
Lighthouse to help debug applications. It will soon enable deploying
apps to Cloud Run, Google Cloud's serverless platform for running
front- and back-end services, and integrate with Checks, Google's
AI-powered compliance platform. 

 PIKO (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Piko is a reverse proxy to connect to external networks. It can be
used to expose services in a customer network, as a
bring-your-own-cloud service, or to connect to IoT devices. The proxy
server may be hosted as a cluster of nodes for fault tolerance, scale,
and zero downtime deployments. Piko was designed to serve production
traffic rather than as a tool for testing and development.

 GOOGLE I/O 2024: HERE'S EVERYTHING GOOGLE JUST ANNOUNCED (14 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Google kicked off its I/O developer conference with a two-hour
presentation containing a rapid-fire stream of announcements. This
article summarizes these announcements into an easy-to-read list. The
announcements include Firebase Genkit, an addition to the Firebase
platform aimed at making it easier for developers to build AI-powered
applications in JavaScript/TypeScript; LearnLM, a family of generative
AI models fine-tuned for learning; AI-generated quizzes on YouTube; a
new discovery feature for apps in Google Play; scam call detection;
Ask Photos, a feature that lets users search across their Google
Photos collection using natural language queries; and much more. 

 ASK HN: DISILLUSIONED AFTER AI? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [14] 

 In this thread, developers discuss how they feel about AI technology
and its impact on their careers. Advances in AI may leave some
developers feeling disillusioned. Some developers feel that whatever
they build will just get gobbled away by some big tech company. AI is
de-democratizing tech in a big way - a handful of giga-scale companies
hold all the cards. The field is still very much in its hype phase, so
while the technology is impressive, there is still a lot it cannot do.
