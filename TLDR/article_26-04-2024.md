 BYTEDANCE 'WOULD RATHER' TORPEDO TIKTOK THAN SELL IT OFF (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 ByteDance would rather shut down TikTok than sell the company. The US
only provides a quarter of TikTok's global revenue and only represents
5% of ByteDance's daily active users across all of its media
platforms. The short deadline to sell would likely put downward
pressure on any potential sale price, making the option even less
appealing. Selling the company would mean divesting the algorithms
that power TikTok and its video recommendations, which raises more
complications. 

 ORACLE'S JUMP TO NASHVILLE SURPRISES AUSTIN (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Oracle has moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to offer its employees a
better lifestyle. Nashville pledged $175 million in incentives and the
state of Tennessee $65 million to help build the Oracle campus in
2021. There were no additional incentives from the city ahead of
Oracle's headquarters announcement. Oracle plans to get closer to the
healthcare industry - the Nashville area's healthcare industry employs
more than 300,000 people and adds $68 billion to the Nashville
region's economy.

 THE ROBOTICS RENAISSANCE (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Intelligent androids will be a part of industrial activities and
aspects of everyday life over the next decade. Modern AI models have
changed the game, allowing robots to learn from online text, images,
and videos. This article takes a look at the modern robotics industry,
highlighting new technologies, current capabilities, potential
applications, major players in the space, and the impacts the
technology will have on society. 

 RECODING VOYAGER 1 ‚Äî NASA'S INTERSTELLAR EXPLORER IS FINALLY MAKING
SENSE AGAIN (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Engineers have partially restored a 1970s-era computer on NASA's
Voyager 1 spacecraft after five months of long-distance
troubleshooting. Voyager 1 is on an outbound trajectory more than 15
billion miles from Earth, so it takes almost two days for engineers to
uplink a command and get a response. The spacecraft suddenly stopped
transmitting intelligible data in November. Engineers eventually found
the issue, which was in the system responsible for packaging
engineering and scientific data for transmission to Earth. A single
chip responsible for storing a portion of memory stopped working,
probably due to either a cosmic ray hit or a failure of aging
hardware.

 INSIGHTS LEARNED FROM EXAMINING 2.4BN CONTAINERS (SPONSOR) [9] 

 The container landscape is changing, with many organizations
exploring innovative technologies such as serverless containers and
GPU-based computing. Datadog [9] examined more than 2.4 billion
containers [9] run by tens of thousands of customers. This report
distills their 10 key findings on container usage, security, and
implementation patterns.

 LLAMAFILE'S PROGRESS, FOUR MONTHS IN (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The llamafile project has become one of Mozilla's top three
most-favorited repositories on GitHub. llamafile is an easy and fast
way to run a wide range of open large language models on consumer
hardware. This article covers the project's development, explaining
the changes that have been implemented since v0.1. The latest release
includes support for the very latest open models and a number of big
performance improvements for CPU inference. 

 RUBY MIGHT BE FASTER THAN YOU THINK (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The crystalruby project allows writing and running Crystal methods
inline inside a Ruby file, bringing significant performance
improvements to code compared to their pure Ruby versions. However,
the Ruby implementation the project uses contains a subtle mistake
that causes significantly more work than it needs to. Fixing this
mistake makes the Ruby code run faster than the 'crystalized' method.
Future advancements in the Ruby JIT may make these small tweaks
unnecessary.

 CORPORATE OPEN SOURCE IS DEAD (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Startups and megacorps have used and abused open source to build up
billions in revenue over the past decade. Corporate Open Source has
died - open source cultures rely on trust, and time and time companies
have shattered that trust with the developers who helped build them.
Contributor License Agreements are a strategy employed by commercial
companies to subvert the open source social contract. Developers
should stay away from projects that require them and stick to open
source licenses that respect their freedom. 

 FCC OFFICIALLY VOTES TO REINSTATE NET NEUTRALITY (6 MINUTE READ) [13]


 The Federal Communications Commission has voted to reinstate net
neutrality, barring broadband providers from slowing or blocking
internet traffic to some sites while improving access to others. The
FCC had announced that it would pursue this as a policy goal in
September and there was no reason the Commission would vote against
it. The new net neutrality rules still have to weather challenges in
court, and depending on the outcome of the election, they may be
rolled back or legislated away. The rules still have to be published
in the Federal Register - and then there is another waiting period -
before they will take effect.
