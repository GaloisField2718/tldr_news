MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla has cut the prices of its models across China, Europe, and the
US. Full Self-Driving is now $8,000 in the US. In China, the revamped
Model 3 is now 241,900 yuan (~$32,000), down from 245,900 yuan
previously and the Model Y was discounted to 249,900 yuan (~$34,500)
from 263,900 yuan. The cheapest Model Y in the US is now $42,990.
Tesla is facing several challenges, including a recall of almost 3,900
Cybertrucks, sales drops, interrupted production schedules, and more.

MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's Real World Testing Lab is an elaborate environment where
Google tests the cameras in its Pixel phones. The lab looks more like
a cluster of Ikea displays than a testing room. It allows Google to
test its devices in realistic environments that simulate where
customers will actually use them. This article takes a look inside the
lab and the kind of testing that Google does to make sure its devices
capture moments in just the right way.

 THE GMO TOOTH MICROBE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO PREVENT CAVITIES (14 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Lumina is a one-time treatment that can present cavities. It can be
applied either at home or by a dentist. The treatment, which can be
pre-ordered for $250 (before taxes and shipping fees), is expected to
be released by mid-June. Marketed as a cosmetic product, the treatment
has yet to successfully move through human clinical trials, leading to
safety and ethical concerns. 

 HOW MANY MORE OZEMPIC-LIKE DRUGS ARE IN THE PIPELINE ‚Äî HERE'S WHAT
RESEARCHERS ARE WORKING ON (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Semaglutide has proved so successful that its manufacturer is unable
to keep up with demand. There is currently a tsunami of clinical
trials for new drugs that also operate on the gut-brain axis and
re-create the action of other intestinal and pancreatic hormones. This
article discusses the state of the industry and new developments on
the horizon. These drugs remain inaccessible for many people due to
cost.

 HOW DOES CHATGPT WORK? AS EXPLAINED BY THE CHATGPT TEAM (9 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 When users ask ChatGPT a question, OpenAI chunks the question into
tokens, creates embeddings, multiplies the embeddings by model
weights, and then samples a prediction. This article explains this
process in detail. It covers pretraining and inference as well as the
system's limitations. Links to other resources that also explain how
ChatGPT works are available in the article. 

 THE POSTGRESQL COMMUNITY DEBATES ALTER SYSTEM (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The PostgreSQL community recently resolved the question of whether to
merge a brief patch adding a new configuration parameter. This article
tells the story of the decision process, which involved one of the
longest-running development discussions in recent PostgreSQL history.
The success of the effort was due to the persistence of a small number
of developers who saw it through months of opposition and 'helpful'
implementation suggestions.

 MEASURING PERSONAL GROWTH (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Measuring things can often help to make life better. This article
presents three metrics for measuring personal growth: rate of change,
time to solve problems, and number of future options. Rate of change
looks at how long it takes to become a new person. Time to solve
problems looks at what big problems have been solved and what needs to
be solved. Number of future options looks at options gained and lost. 

 SAMSUNG SHIFTS EXECUTIVES TO SIX-DAY WORKWEEKS TO ‚ÄòINJECT A SENSE
OF CRISIS' (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Samsung has introduced a company-wide six-day workweek policy for
executives. The company had disappointing financial results last year
and is now trying to tackle ongoing business uncertainty. The new
workweek policy aims to inject a sense of crisis as part of an all-out
effort to overcome its current challenges. Employees under the
executive level are not expected to follow suit. Samsung is facing
increased competition in the production of high-bandwidth memory chips
alongside wider economic concerns like rising borrowing costs and oil
prices and a rapid depreciation of Korean currency.
