 ONE MAJOR REASON AI ADOPTION STALLS? TRAINING. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI implementation often goes sideways due to unclear goals and a lack
of a clear framework.

We love the AI Training Checklist from You.com [4]. It pinpoints
common pitfalls and guides you to build a capable, confident team that
can make the most out of your AI investment. What's inside:

 	* Key steps for building a successful AI training program
 	* Guidance on overcoming employee resistance and fostering adoption
 	* A structured worksheet to monitor progress and share across your
organization

Set your AI initiatives on the right track and get the checklist [4].

 NEW VERSION OF SIRI TO 'LEAN' ON GOOGLE GEMINI (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple plans to roll out a revamped version of Siri around March next
year. It will reportedly lean on Google Gemini and have an AI-powered
web search feature. Apple is rumored to be paying Google to create a
custom Gemini-based model that can run on its Private Cloud Compute
servers to power Siri. The upgraded Siri will not include Google
services or Gemini features. 

 ELON MUSK: FUTURE STARLINK SATELLITES WILL BECOME ORBITING DATA
CENTERS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk recently suggested that scaling up Starlink V3 satellites
would enable the creation of a network of orbiting data centers. The
V3 satellites will be able to transmit data at up to 200Gbps. SpaceX
will need to complete Starship before it can launch its V3 satellites
- each V3 could weigh up to 2,000 kilograms, almost four times the
current mass of the V2 Mini Starlink satellites.

 NASA TEST FLIGHT SEEKS TO HELP BRING COMMERCIAL SUPERSONIC TRAVEL
BACK (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NASA's newest experimental supersonic jet, the X-59 Quesst (Quiet
SuperSonic Technology), made its first flight last Tuesday. The
inaugural flight validated the jet's airworthiness and safety. The
X-59 generates a lower 'sonic thump' compared to other supersonic jet
designs thanks to its long, slender nose, which breaks up pressure
waves that would otherwise merge on parts of the airplane. Its design
limits shock waves and directs sound waves up to the sky rather than
down toward the ground. The single-seat, single-engine jet can cruise
at Mach 1.4 at an altitude of 55,000 feet, nearly twice as high and
twice as fast as commercial airliners typically fly. 

 WHAT THE AIR YOU BREATHE MAY BE DOING TO YOUR BRAIN (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 There is increasing evidence that chronic exposure to PM2.5 is
associated with dementia. These particles are among the smallest. They
are easily inhaled and can travel directly from the nose to the brain.
Increasing air pollution poses a big health risk for older adults.

 6 STRATEGIES FOR BETTER REQUEST MANAGEMENT IN JIRA (SPONSOR) [9] 

 As your team grows, so does the volume and complexity of requests
coming in. Without a streamlined request management process, it's easy
for tasks to fall through the cracks. The good news? A few small
changes [9] can make a big impact on how efficiently your team handles
incoming Jira requests. Read the guide by Appfire [9] 

 IMMUTABLE RELEASES ARE NOW GENERALLY AVAILABLE (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GitHub releases now support immutability. Immutable releases protect
assets and tags from being tampered with after publication. This
ensures that the software remains secure and trustworthy. Immutable
releases can be enabled at the repository or organizational level.
Once enabled, all new releases will be immutable - existing releases
remain mutable unless they are republished. Disabling immutability
doesn't affect releases created while it was enabled. 

 YOUR URL IS YOUR STATE (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Good URLs describe a conversation between the user and the
application. They capture intent, preserve context, and enable sharing
in ways that no other state management solution can match. URLs can be
state containers, user interfaces, and contracts all rolled into one.
State management libraries still have their place, but the best
solution is just to use the URL.

 AI BROKE INTERVIEWS (25 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI caused the entire remote-interview infrastructure to collapse by
breaking the basic assumption that the person answering was the person
thinking. Companies should start testing for things only real
engineers can do. They need high-signal, human-centric interviews that
reflect how engineering actually works. Future interviews will feel
like a conversation between people who want to build something
together. 

 PALANTIR THINKS COLLEGE MIGHT BE A WASTE. SO IT'S HIRING HIGH-SCHOOL
GRADS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Palantir's 'Meritocracy Fellowship' is an experiment launched under
the thesis that existing universities in the US are no longer reliable
or necessary for training good workers. Palantir is a data analytics
company known for its government contracts. The four-month fellowship
program gives its 22 students a chance to work full-time at Palantir.
This article gives readers a look inside the program to see what it is
like.
