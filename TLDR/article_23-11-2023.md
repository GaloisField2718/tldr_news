 TESLA OPEN SOURCES ALL DESIGN AND ENGINEERING OF ORIGINAL ROADSTER (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla has open-sourced all of the design and engineering of the
original Roadster. This includes everything from Owner's Manuals to
Circuits and Connectors. The next-gen Roadster is now several years
behind schedule. The release of the design may be a hint that the
next-gen Roadster is close to being produced. Elon Musk had said
earlier this year that the final design and engineering of the
Roadster will be completed by the end of 2023, so the vehicle should
reach production by the end of 2024. 

 EXCLUSIVE-OPENAI RESEARCHERS WARNED BOARD OF AI BREAKTHROUGH AHEAD OF
CEO OUSTER (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI researchers wrote a letter to the board of directors warning
of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery they said could
threaten humanity days before Sam Altman's ouster. The letter and
algorithm were key developments that contributed to the decision. The
development could be a breakthrough in the startup's search for
artificial general intelligence. This article collates some of the
rumors about what the breakthrough may be.

 NASA WILL LAUNCH A MARS MISSION ON BLUE ORIGIN‚ÄôS FIRST NEW GLENN
ROCKET (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket will be launching a pair of Mars
probes for NASA on its first mission. The mission is a relatively
low-cost one, with a budget significantly less than any mission NASA
has sent to Mars in recent history. It aims to measure plasma and
magnetic fields around Mars. Mars launch windows typically come every
26 months, so if the mission doesn't launch by late 2024, the next
opportunity will be in late 2026. 

 ZOOM FATIGUE IS REAL, ACCORDING TO BRAIN SCANS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new study found that virtual meetings exhaust the brain more than
face-to-face conversations. The rise in remote work and online
learning has revealed a phenomenon called Zoom fatigue, a feeling of
exhaustion linked with videoconferencing. It results in a
deterioration in the quality of communication and collaboration and
can impact both professional and personal relationships. The absence
of nuanced nonverbal cues makes it challenging for participants to
fully engage and connect in a meaningful way.

requests and demonstrates why some common approaches are dangerous. It

 REFLECTING ON 18 YEARS AT GOOGLE (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This blog post was written by someone who worked at Google for 18
years starting in October 2005. They experienced the early post-IPO
Google and watched the company throughout the years as it received
criticisms for actions that were sincerely intended to be good for
society. The culture at Google has changed significantly since it
started. The deterioration of its culture will eventually become
irreversible as the people who are needed to act as a moral compass
are the same kinds of people who don't join an organization without a
moral compass.
