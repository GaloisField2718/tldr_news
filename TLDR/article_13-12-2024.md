 GOOGLE STEPS INTO “EXTENDED REALITY” ONCE AGAIN WITH ANDROID XR
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Android XR is a mixed-reality operating system that will power future
headsets and glasses. The first headset powered by the OS will be
Project Moohan, a mixed-reality headset built by Samsung available for
purchase next year. Project Moohan seems to be aimed at the same use
purposes as the Apple Vision Pro. Android XR is available for
developers now. 

 IOS 18.2 REVIEW: THE AI APPLE PROMISED US (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 iOS 18.2 introduces several long-awaited Apple Intelligence tools.
These features require an iPhone 15 Pro or the latest iPhone 16
models. This article looks at the new features, which include ChatGPT
integration, emoji generation, and more. Examples of emojis generated
by the new Genmoji feature are available in the article.

 WAYMO'S MARKET SHARE IS NOW EQUAL TO LYFT WITHIN SF (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 When Waymo launched in August last year, Uber and Lyft were at 66%
and 34% market share in San Francisco. 15 months later, Waymo is at
22% market share, the same as Lyft, while Uber sits at 55%. Waymo's
wait times are longer than Uber and Lyft because the company doesn't
have enough cars on the road. It's possible that Waymo's market share
will climb even faster as it puts more cars on the road and reduces
wait times to be in line with its competition. 

 THOSE DESIGNER BABIES EVERYONE IS FREAKING OUT ABOUT – IT'S NOT
LIKELY TO HAPPEN (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Geneticists cannot read the genetic code and know who will be about
average in intelligence and athleticism. Traits and diseases that
result from multiple genes and lifestyle factors cannot be predicted
using just DNA. Designer babies aren't possible now and will unlikely
be possible in the future. The creation of designer babies is not
limited by technology, but by biology.

 WAVE TERMINAL (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Wave Terminal can launch graphical widgets that are controlled and
integrated directly with the CLI. It makes it easy to access the web
from the CLI. Wave Terminal features a base terminal, directory
browser, file previews, a graphical editor, a web browser, and
integrated AI chat. 

 HARVARD AND GOOGLE TO RELEASE 1 MILLION PUBLIC-DOMAIN BOOKS AS AI
TRAINING DATASET (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Harvard University plans to release a dataset that includes around
one million public-domain books that are no longer copyright-protected
due to their age. The dataset's release is aimed at leveling the
playing field in the AI industry, allowing research labs and AI
startups to access a huge dataset to train large language models. It
is unclear when or how the dataset will be released.

 NETFLIX'S EXTRAORDINARY PARENTAL LEAVE WAS PART OF ITS CULTURE.
THAT'S OVER (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Netflix made headlines nearly a decade ago when it pledged to give
new parents unlimited time off in their child's first year. More
staffers than expected took full advantage of the benefit, which
Netflix found unsustainable. The company has spent the last few years
walking back the policy. Netflix's new mindset of cost-consciousness
has aided its recovery from a sluggish period. The long-term risk for
Netflix is that the characteristics that made its workplace distinct
will erode, making it harder to attract and retain talent. 

 I SAW GOOGLE'S PLAN TO PUT ANDROID ON YOUR FACE (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article details an experience with Samsung's Project Moohan, the
first device to run Android XR. The experience of using its UI feels
similar to that of the Apple Vision Pro's, but Google-flavored. Google
believes that Gemini will help Android XR crack the augmented reality
puzzle. Video demos from Google are available in the article.
