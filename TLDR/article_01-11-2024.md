exploration. The system uses a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o. 

 ALEXA'S NEW AI BRAIN IS STUCK IN THE LAB (22 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amazon executives were confident a beta version of a new and improved

[8] 

 Meta has partnered with GelSight and Wonik Robotics to commercialize
tactile sensors for AI. The partnership aims to create devices that
can learn about the world in richer detail to advance research into
AI. Meta is working with GelSight on Digit 360, a tactile fingertip
with human-level multimodal sensing capabilities. Its work with Wonik

360. These products will be available for purchase next year. 

 ‘CLOUD-MILKING': THE ZERO-ENERGY TECHNIQUE KEEPING YOUNG TREES
ALIVE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cloud milking is a zero-energy technique for extracting water from
fog. The technique mimics the way that the leaves capture water
droplets from fog. It involves erecting special structures in the path
of the wind to collect water droplets as the wind blows fog through
them. Cloud milking is revolutionizing the recovery of forests
devastated by fire and drought.

 HOW TO ACCELERATE CODE REVIEWS WITH NUDGES: INSIGHTS FROM MICROSOFT'S
STUDY (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Pull requests (PRs) are essential for ensuring code quality and
enabling collaboration across teams, but they can become major
bottlenecks. Microsoft and the Delft University of Technology
conducted a comprehensive study that analyzed 22,875 pull requests to
uncover the key factors that contribute to delays in PR completion.
The study led to the development of Nudge, an automated system
designed to send timely 'nudges' to authors and reviewers. Using Nudge
reduces PR completion times by 60%. This article looks at the key
insights from Microsoft's research and explores how nudges transform
the code review process.

 'A LOT OF DEMORALIZED PEOPLE': GHOST JOBS ARE WREAKING HAVOC ON TECH
WORKERS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Ghost jobs are a common phenomenon in the tech industry. These fake
job listings serve multiple purposes. Employers make these listings to
maintain a presence on job boards and build a talent pool. They also
use the listings to gauge how replaceable their employees are, look
more stable during hiring freezes, make employees feel replaceable,
and trick overworked employees into believing that more people will be
brought on to alleviate their overwhelming workloads.
