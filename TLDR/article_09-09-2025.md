 SPACEX'S $17 BILLION DEAL PLUNGES MUSK DEEPER INTO WIRELESS MARKET (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SpaceX is paying $17 billion for the rights to use some of EchoStar's
spectrum for cellphone service. The deal gives SpaceX access to two
license blocks that allow carriers to provide ground-based 5G
cellphone and broadband service in the US. The spectrum will be used
as a foundation for Starlink's direct-to-cell business and may be
shared with telecom partners. EchoStar will use the funds to retire
debt and fund operations. 

 INSIDE SPOTIFY'S PLOT TO TAKE DOWN APPLE (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Apple's position as a gateway to the digital world is being severely
imperiled by efforts from rival tech companies like Epic Games and
Spotify. The EU Commission leveled a $2 billion fine against Apple for
conduct against Spotify and others in March last year and introduced
new laws to limit Apple's control over the App Store. These moves are
being copied in other parts of the world, putting billions of dollars
of profit at risk. The uncertainty comes at a time when iPhone sales
are under pressure and investors are worried that Apple is failing to
keep up with AI innovations.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 'NEAR TELEPATHIC' WEARABLE LETS YOU COMMUNICATE SILENTLY WITH DEVICES
(3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Boston startup AlterEgo has unveiled a wearable that lets users
silently communicate with machines using subvocal speech. The machine
decodes neuromuscular signals in the jaw and throat, translating the
signals with high accuracy. AlterEgo has positioned the device as a
practical alternative to brain implants or EMG wristbands. A video
from AlterEgo introducing the technology is available in the article. 

 TAKEDA NEARS FIRST THERAPY FOR ROOT CAUSE OF NARCOLEPSY (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Takeda Pharmaceutical has developed a drug that significantly
improves outcomes for narcoleptic patients. The drug, called
oveporexton, could become the first treatment to target the root cause
of the chronic sleep disorder. Patients who take the drug experience
increased daytime alertness, fewer episodes of sudden muscle tone
loss, and overall improvement in quality of life. No serious side
effects have been reported, but some patients report insomnia and
increased urinary urgency and frequency. The company plans to file for
regulatory approvals globally by March.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 THE LAST PROGRAMMERS (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 We're the last generation of people who will translate ideas into
code by hand. Future developers will just describe what they want and
have it appear on the screen. The money and talent flowing into AI
development make this future inevitable. The question is whether
you'll be ready when it comes. Focus on the parts of product
development that actually matter - understanding people, building the
things they want, and getting those things in front of them. 

 SKIP TO THE END (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 For the first 75 years of computing, database lookups were trivial,
and computer vision was virtually impossible. Today, you can just take
a pick on your phone and ask it questions about the image. To really
take advantage of what AI can do, developers need to start thinking
about software differently. Tools no longer need to help users achieve
outcomes - they just deliver the outcomes.

MINUTE READ) [15]

six days a week. Spending data shows that San Francisco-based
employees are increasingly working on the schedule. The pattern is
happening across industries, not just in tech. 

 OPENAI EXECUTIVES RATTLED BY CAMPAIGNS TO DERAIL FOR-PROFIT
RESTRUCTURING (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI executives are reportedly growing concerned that increasing
political scrutiny could impede its efforts to become a for-profit
company and have discussed the option of moving out of the state.
Attorneys general in California and Delaware are investigating
OpenAI's proposed plan to restructure into a for-profit company.
OpenAI could be sued for potentially breaking nonprofit law and may be
required to pay a settlement as a condition for the restructure.
Failing to restructure could be catastrophic for the startup.
