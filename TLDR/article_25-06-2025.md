 AT AMAZON'S BIGGEST DATA CENTER, EVERYTHING IS SUPERSIZED FOR AI (11
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Amazon's Project Rainier involves building data centers so large they
would have been considered absurd just a few years ago. The tech
industry requires massive networks of specialized computer chips for
its increasingly powerful AI technologies. Over the next several
years, Amazon plans to build around 30 data centers at a 1,200-acre
stretch of farmland outside New Carlisle, Indiana. The entire complex,
which will consume 2.2 gigawatts of electricity, will form one giant
machine intended just for artificial intelligence. Project Rainier
will also include facilities in Mississippi and possibly other
locations like North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

 GOOGLE'S NEW ROBOTICS AI CAN RUN WITHOUT THE CLOUD AND STILL TIE YOUR
SHOES (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google DeepMind has revealed a new on-device vision language action
(VLA) model that can control robots. It doesn't have a cloud
component, so robots using the model can operate with full autonomy.
This is the first version of Google's robotics model that developers
can tune for their specific uses. Robotics researchers can adapt the
VLA to new tasks with as little as 50 to 100 demonstrations. 

 WORLD'S LARGEST CAMERA SHOWS GALAXY IN 3,200 MEGAPIXEL GLORY AS RUBIN
TELESCOPE GOES ONLINE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is finally online and photographing the
galaxy. It found 2,104 new asteroids in the Solar System in its
initial ten hours of operation. The telescope will allow scientists to
explore the cosmos in new ways at a scale that will enable discoveries
that should fundamentally change our understanding of the universe.
The observatory is located on the El Peñón peak of Cerro Pachón, an
8,799-foot-high mountain in the Chilean Andes.

 CHATGPT WOWS OFFICE WORKERS. THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR MICROSOFT (8 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Drug maker Amgen Inc. last spring announced plans to buy Microsoft's
Copilot assistant for 20,000 employees, but 13 months later, Amgen
employees are using OpenAI's ChatGPT. The company expanded its ChatGPT
use earlier this year after hearing from employees that it helped with
tasks such as research and summarizing scientific documents. Its push
into the enterprise market is complicating its already fraught
relationship with Microsoft. OpenAI claims it has 3 million paying
business users. 

 ANTHROPIC WINS A MAJOR FAIR USE VICTORY FOR AI — BUT IT'S STILL IN
TROUBLE FOR STEALING BOOKS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic used both downloaded ebooks and purchased and scanned print
books to create the data it used to train its models. A judge found
that the scanned books fell under fair use as they were transformative
versions of the works and were not shared outside of the company. The
downloaded ebooks did not count as fair use - these will be the
subject of a forthcoming jury trial. The judge found that training a
large language model on unlicensed data counted as 'fair use'.
