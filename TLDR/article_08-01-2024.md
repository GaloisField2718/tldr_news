 FIGURE 01 HAS LEARNED TO MAKE COFFEE ‚òïÔ∏è (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figure 01 is a commercially viable autonomous humanoid robot. At 5'6"
and 60kg, it can carry a payload of 20kg and move at a speed of 1.2m/s
for around 5 hours of runtime. Its human form factor allows it to
perform dexterous tasks and lend support across manufacturing,
logistics, warehousing, and retail. This thread contains a video
showing Figure 01 making a coffee - it learned the task just by
watching humans make coffee.

 WEIRD THINGS ENGINEERS BELIEVE ABOUT WEB DEVELOPMENT (20 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Many web developers have ideas about browsers and the Web that can be
a bit dubious. For example, they assume that web browser engineers,
web developers, and the people who make Web specifications know the
Web really well. Other dubious ideas include the myth that browsers
aren't meant to run SPAs, that MPAs will replace SPAs, that all sites
should work without JavaScript, that web development shouldn't need a
build step, and that what they know is representative of web
development at large. It's easy to assume what you know is
representative of web development in general, but the field is much
broader and deeper than most people know.

 WHY I‚ÄôM EXCITED ABOUT PROFIT-SHARING STARTUPS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Most successful outcomes in tech often take many years to mature. The
future is unpredictable and the macro environment can not be
controlled. Several big shifts will drive founders and investors to
pursue profit-sharing models in 2024 and beyond. Profit-sharing
startups will become more popular as people look to diversify their
net worth and capture liquidity sooner. This will not preclude
founders from raising traditional venture capital - some businesses
will still need VC to scale and win a market.
