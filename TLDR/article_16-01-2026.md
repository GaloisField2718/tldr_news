 OPENAI INVESTS IN SAM ALTMAN'S BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE STARTUP MERGE
LABS (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI has invested in CEO Sam Altman's brain-computer interface
startup, Merge Labs. Merge Labs is dedicated to bridging biological
and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability. It intends to
develop entirely new technologies that connect with neurons using
molecules instead of electrodes to transmit and receive information
using deep-reaching modalities like ultrasound. OpenAI believes that
brain-computer interfaces will create a natural, human-centered way
for anyone to seamlessly interact with AI. 

 APPLE IS FIGHTING FOR TSMC CAPACITY AS NVIDIA TAKES CENTER STAGE (11
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TSMC's CEO recently told Apple executives that they would need to
acquiesce to the largest price rise in years. Apple once held a
dominant position on TSMC's customer list, but it is now fighting for
production capacity. Its chip designs are no longer guaranteed a place
among TSMC's almost two dozen fabs. TSMC's largest client is now
likely Nvidia.

 TESLA RELEASES RARE LOOK AT ITS LITHIUM REFINERY, CONFIRMS PRODUCTION
START (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla's massive lithium refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, has
officially started production. The company has released a new video,
available in the article, showing off the new site. Tesla's process is
acid-free and produces a benign co-product that can be used in
concrete mixes. The process is more sustainable than traditional
methods and eliminates hazardous byproducts. 

 NASA'S FIRST MEDICAL EVACUATION FROM SPACE ENDS WITH ON-TARGET
SPLASHDOWN (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Four astronauts returned to Earth early after one of the crew members
encountered an unspecified medical issue last week. They splashed down
in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego at 08:41 UTC on
January 15. Officials have not identified whose health was in question
or what was afflicting the ailing crew member. The medical issue did
not appear to affect the crew's return to Earth, and they exited the
spacecraft appearing in good health and good spirits.

 OPEN RESPONSES (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Open Responses is an open-source spec for building multi-provider,
interoperable LLM interfaces on top of the original OpenAI Responses
API. It is multi-provider by default and extensible without
fragmentation. Useful for real-world workflows, Open Responses can be
used to build agentic systems without rewriting the stack for every
model. Examples of projects built with Open Responses are available in
the thread. 

 BEYOND SENIOR: CONSIDER THE STAFF PATH! (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The staff engineering job isn't for everyone. It is totally fine to
stay at Senior or move into management. It's worth considering a path
toward Staff, as it is a fulfilling role. This post takes a look at
what it takes to get promoted to Staff and what the role entails.

 SOFTWARE'S YOUTUBE MOMENT IS HAPPENING NOW (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The barriers to video creation collapsed in the 2000s when everyone
got a camera in their pocket and platforms like YouTube changed what
could qualify as entertainment. YouTube has now evolved into a media
ecosystem where it is as common for entertainment to come from
independent creators as from traditional broadcasters. Software is
following the same path. AI has massively democratized leverage and
productivity for creative people. 

 TAIWAN WILL INVEST $250 BILLION IN US CHIPMAKING UNDER NEW TRADE DEAL
(5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The US and Taiwan have reached a trade agreement to build chips and
chip factories on American soil. Taiwanese chip and technology
companies will invest at least $250 billion in production capacity in
the US. The Taiwanese government will guarantee $250 billion in credit
for these companies. The US will limit tariffs in Taiwan to 15% and
commit to zero tariffs on generic pharmaceuticals, their ingredients,
aircraft components, and some natural resources.
