MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Warner has urged shareholders to reject Paramount's hostile takeover
bid due to concerns about the financing. Paramount is using an Ellison
family trust to backstop the deal - Warner wants Larry Ellison to give
a stronger personal guarantee that he is fully committed to the bid.
Paramount isn't likely to raise its bid. Instead, it is engaging with
shareholders and gathering feedback on its tender about what it needs
to do.

LAUNCH FOREVER (60 MINUTE READ) [7]

 TRUMP COMMITS TO MOON LANDING BY 2028, FOLLOWED BY A LUNAR OUTPOST
TWO YEARS LATER (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 President Donald Trump signed an executive order outlining NASA's
policy objectives for the next three years a couple of hours after a
judge formally swore Jared Isaacman as the agency's administrator. The
executive order states that the country must pursue a space policy
that will extend the reach of human discovery, secure the nation's
vital economic and security interests, unleash commercial development,
and lay the foundation for a new space age. There are no concrete
plans to send humans to Mars in the document. There's also a lack of
reference to space science. An overview of the contents of the
executive order is available in the article.

 CLOUDFLARE'S LATEST OUTAGE PROVES DANGERS OF GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
CHANGES (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Cloudflare's most recent outage was caused by a seemingly innocent
but global configuration change. The incident shows why the largest
systems in the world will have to implement safer ways to roll out
configs. Implementing gradual rollouts for all configuration files is
a lot of work, so it doesn't make sense unless the stability of
systems is more important than fast iteration. Smaller companies and
products probably won't need to implement staged configuration
rollouts because the infrastructure work slows down product
development.

 LET A THOUSAND SOCIETIES BLOOM (50 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 One of the recurring ideological themes of the last few decades has
been the idea of creating entirely new communities, cultures, cities,
and even countries. In this world of a thousand nations, people would
be able to choose the communities that best fit their values. These
ideas inspired Vitalik Buterin to create Zuzalu, an experimental
pop-up city in Montenegro, in 2023. This post provides an updated
picture of the space, detailing what Buterin has learned since 2023,
and sketches out a world that the movement could be driving towards.
