 X IS OFFICIALLY WORTH LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT ELON MUSK PAID FOR IT (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 X employees were awarded equity in the company at a valuation of $19
billion on Monday. At $45 per share, X's self-assessed value is at a
55% discount to Musk's original purchase price. The equity is in the
form of restricted stock units, so employees will have to wait for a
liquidity event to sell them. Employees will have to pay tax on any
sales as income.

change. The ad-free subscription will initially apply across all
linked Meta accounts, but the company will start charging extra for
linked accounts starting in March 2024.

 WORLD'S SMALLEST PARTICLE ACCELERATOR IS 54 MILLION TIMES SMALLER
THAN THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER ‚Äî AND IT WORKS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new particle accelerator known as a nanophotonic electron
accelerator is around the size of a small coin. The device consists of
a small microchip that houses an even smaller vacuum tube made up of
thousands of individual pillars. Researchers can accelerate electrons
by firing mini laser beams at these pillars. The main goal of creating
these devices is to use the energy given off by the accelerated
electrons in targeted medical treatments that can replace damaging
forms of radiotherapy. 

 NEW LASER ENABLED 3D-PRINTING METHOD MAKES STEEL MORE AFFORDABLE (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A new method for 3D printing metal developed by a team led by the
University of Cambridge allows structural alterations to be written
into metal alloys during 3D printing. It allows for the creation of
complex forms and the engineering of the structure and characteristics
in the material. The method gave the researchers complete control over
both the strength and toughness of its structures. It uses typical
laser-based 3D printing technology with some modifications.

 HOPPING INSTEAD OF HUSTLING: SURVEY TELLS US HOW DEVELOPERS ARE
TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article summarizes the results from Stack Overflow's Job Report,
which looks at job insights from the tech community. New developers
switched jobs more frequently than early- and mid-career developers in
the last three years. The decreasing amount of entry-level openings
and the lack of perceived stability within the tech industry could be
why developers are migrating out of the tech industry and exploring
career changes.

 META‚ÄôS AI RESEARCH HEAD WANTS OPEN SOURCE LICENSING TO CHANGE (5
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While Meta's Llama 2 is free for many, it was released under a
limited license that doesn't meet all of the requirements of the Open
Source Initiative. Releasing AI models as completely open source may
have potential risks and accountability issues for the companies that
release them. Acknowledging these risks while providing an avenue for
feedback isn't currently a standard part of the open source
discussion, but it should be a norm for anyone creating AI models.

arguments in the case.
