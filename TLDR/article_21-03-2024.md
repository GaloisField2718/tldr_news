CUSTOM LLM APPLICATIONS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 LLM tooling just keeps getting better. Haystack [4] lets you build
scalable, extensible, and custom AI systems that are meant for
production.
‚úÖ Integrates with all major model providers (Mistral, OpenAI,
Google, Cohere, Amazon Bedrock and more) as well as vector databases.

‚úÖ Open source framework [5] meant for customization and extension.

‚úÖ Compose your own RAG pipelines by combining the models and
functionality that _you_ need.

Check out the quick start guide [5] to create your first RAG
application in minutes; or learn how to use Haystack with tutorials
[6], cookbooks [7] and documentation [8].

 GPT-5 MIGHT ARRIVE THIS SUMMER AS A ‚ÄúMATERIALLY BETTER‚Äù UPDATE TO
CHATGPT (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI is expected to release a major AI model, possibly GPT-5,
sometime in mid-2024, likely during the summer. The new model will
likely be a multimodel large language model with similar capabilities
to GPT-4, but better. OpenAI is still reportedly training the model,
after which it will go through internal safety testing to identify any
issues before public release. Other issues, besides those that may
come up from testing, may delay the launch. 

 HERE'S A VIDEO OF THE FIRST HUMAN NEURALINK PATIENT CONTROLLING A
COMPUTER WITH HIS THOUGHTS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Neuralink has shared a video of its brain-computer interface in
action inside a human patient. The patient, a 29-year-old man named
Nolan Arbaugh who is paralyzed from the neck down, is able to control
a cursor on a screen using Neuralink's device. He is able to play
games online for about eight hours before the implant needs to
recharge. Arbaugh reports that his experience with the implant has so
far been positive, despite some initial issues. The video is available
in the article.

 MAKING CELLS YOUNG (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Aging wreaks havoc across the body, causing cells to struggle to
perform functions they could previously do with ease. The field of
aging has been debating how it works for decades. A new explanation
for the phenomenon of aging called the 'information theory' postulates
that aging is mainly driven by the loss of epigenetic information and
that cells can be reprogrammed into behaving like their younger selves
by reverting them to their pluripotent states. While the theory offers
a path to reversing aging, there are still many challenges to overcome
before the technology can be used - errors made while reprogramming
cells can result in cancer and other major complications. 

 SCIENTISTS SAY THEY CAN CUT HIV OUT OF CELLS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Scientists from the University of Amsterdam claim they have
successfully eliminated HIV from infected cells using CRISPR
gene-editing technology. The work remains a proof-of-concept and will
not become a cure for the disease any time soon. The study's findings
are still being scrutinized.

 REDIS ADOPTS DUAL SOURCE-AVAILABLE LICENSING (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 All future versions of Redis will be released with source-available
licenses starting with Redis 7.4. Redis will no longer be distributed
under the three-clause Berkeley Software Distribution and will be
instead dual-licensed under the Redis Source Available License and
Server Side Public License. The new licenses enable Redis to
sustainably provide permissive use of its source code, allowing it to
continue to be freely available to developers, customers, and partners
through Redis Community Edition as Redis moves on to its next phase of
development as a real-time data platform with a unified set of
clients, tools, and core product offerings.

 DOCUSIGN'S 7,000 EMPLOYEES AND THE IRON LAW OF B2B SAAS SALES (8
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Docusign's over 7,000 employees are mostly in sales. Around 24% of
its workforce is in engineering, product development, and customer
operations. The company's sales/engineering split isn't that unusual.
Even if a company is well positioned in a space, its future and
profits are always uncertain - putting resources into new products or
features just in case makes sense as the cost of being overtaken is
very high.
