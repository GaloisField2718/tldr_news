SMALL MODULAR REACTORS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amazon has signed an agreement with Dominion Energy to explore the
development of a small modular nuclear reactor near Dominion's
existing North Anna nuclear power station. Google and Microsoft have
announced similar plans. Tech companies are increasingly buying into

power will also help these companies reach net-zero carbon emissions. 

 ‘SMART' INSULIN PREVENTS DIABETIC HIGHS — AND DEADLY LOWS (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists have created a new form of insulin that can modify its
activity in response to glucose levels in the blood, reducing high
blood sugar concentrations while preventing levels from dropping too
low. It has been tested in pigs and rats with encouraging results.
Further research to optimize the molecule is ongoing. There are
several smart insulin drugs in the works - scientists aim to generate
a suite of smart insulin drugs to enable doctors to individualize
therapies for their patients.

 GOOGLE CHROME IS SWITCHING TO MANIFEST V3, BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
FOR AD BLOCKERS? (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 While Manifest V3 makes things harder for ad blockers, it's not the
death of ad blockers by any stretch. uBlock Origin already has a new
version built on Manifest V3 that works almost as well as the Manifest
V2 version and with added privacy and performance benefits. However,
there are quite a few filtering capabilities that can't be ported to
Manifest V3. There are tools in Chrome's Extensions settings that help
users determine whether an extension is compatible with Manifest V3
and find alternatives for incompatible extensions.

MINUTE READ) [14]

services as easy as signing up for one. Businesses offering online
signups will be required to implement a click to cancel and there must
be a way for customers to cancel online or over the phone if they
signed up in person. Most of the final rule's provisions will go into
effect 180 days after it is published in the Federal Register.
