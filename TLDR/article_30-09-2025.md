 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 OPENAI TAKES ON GOOGLE, AMAZON WITH NEW AGENTIC SHOPPING SYSTEM (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI's new 'Instant Checkout' feature, which allows ChatGPT users
to make Etsy and Shopify purchases within conversations, is now
available in the US to ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Free logged-in users.
Users can now just tap a 'Buy' button to confirm their order,
shipping, and payment details to complete a purchase. OpenAI says that
the product results it surfaces are organic and unsponsored and ranked
purely on relevance to the user. Merchants will be charged a fee for
completed purchases. 

 OPENAI WILL REPORTEDLY RELEASE A TIKTOK-LIKE SOCIAL APP ALONGSIDE
SORA 2 (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI is preparing to release a standalone social app powered by its
Sora 2 video model. The app will reportedly closely resemble TikTok
but only feature AI-generated content. There will be no option for
users to upload photos or videos. Users will be limited to generating
10-second-long clips. They will be able to create videos using their
likeness - and receive a notification whenever their likeness is used
by someone else. The app will refuse to generate some videos due to
copyright restrictions.

 CHINA'S OYSTER-INSPIRED ‘BONE GLUE' BONDS FRACTURES, CAN REPLACE
METAL IN SURGERY (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Bone-02 is a new kind of medical adhesive created by a team of
Chinese researchers. It is designed to repair broken bones quickly
without the need for metal plates, screws, or big surgeries. The glue
can be injected directly into a fracture site to help speed up bone
repair, bonding bone fragments together in two to three minutes, even
in blood-rich areas. The researchers were inspired by oysters, which
have a remarkable ability to attach to hard surfaces in harsh
environments. This is due to a special protein-rich adhesive that
works in wet, salty, and constantly moving conditions, forming a tough
bond that resists both pressure and erosion. 

 6,100-QUBIT PROCESSOR SHATTERS QUANTUM COMPUTING RECORD (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Physicists from the California Institute of Technology have built a
quantum computing array containing 6,100 qubits, well above the
thousand or so qubits previous systems contain. They used cesium atoms
as their qubits, trapping them in place with a complex system of
lasers that act as tweezers to keep the atoms as stable as possible.
Large arrays allow for better error correction, which helps to
overcome the inherent fragility of qubits by providing a surplus to
double-check machine operations.

 FORK YEAH: VALKEY 9 SHARPENS EDGE AGAINST REDIS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Valkey, which was forked from Redis in April last year, is set to
release its ninth iteration next month. The update promises improved
resource optimization and availability. It will allow multiple logical
databases in cluster mode, enabling developers to combine many
different applications using the same cluster. Valkey 9 also promises
unified auto-failover configuration for high availability, regardless
of deployment choices, so clusters stay consistent from development to
staging to production. It has a safe shutdown mode, so a shutdown
command does not pull the plug on production without a deliberate,
confirmed action. 

 IN THE ECONOMY OF USER EFFORT, BE A BARGAIN, NOT A SCAM (15 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Products win when user effort scales smoothly with use case
complexity, usability cliffs are engineered out, and every interaction
declares a meaningful piece of user intent. This requires hard
tradeoffs, saying no a lot, and prioritizing user needs at the
organizational level. Treating user effort like real money forces
developers to design with restraint. Prioritize consumers over
producers consistently to turn delight into trust, trust into loyalty,
and loyalty into product-market fit.

straight. The new model is particularly adept in fields like
cybersecurity, financial services, and research. It helped beta
testers with complex, long-context tasks, from engineering in
codebases to in-product features and research. Claude Sonnet 4.5 will
be paired with other updates to help developers code their own AI
agents.

engineers still need to review every line, shape the architecture, and
carry the responsibility for how it runs in production.
