 GOOGLE CEO SAYS MORE JOB CUTS ARE NEEDED IN 2024 IN ORDER TO REACH
‚ÄòAMBITIOUS GOALS‚Äô (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google CEO Sundar Pichai has warned employees that more job cuts are
coming this year. The company leadership is preparing its AI goals for
the year and will publish its 2024 objectives and key results this
week. Pichai says that the layoffs won't be at the scale of last
year's reductions and will not touch every team. Alphabet shares
jumped 55% last year and its revenue in the third quarter returned to
double-digit growth alongside a rebound in the digital ad market.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 MEET HELIOS, A NEW CLASS OF SPACE TUG WITH SOME REAL MUSCLE (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Space tugs are miniature spacecraft that ferry small satellites to
designated orbits. They are particularly useful for satellites that
launch as part of a rideshare mission that seek to reach a different
altitude or inclination than that of the primary payload. Impulse
Space has built an in-space tug that can haul bigger satellites to
more distant orbits. Helios is sized to fit within a Falcon 9 fairing
and designed to fly on any medium- or heavy-lift vehicle to boost its
capability. It will allow satellites to reach geostationary orbit
within a day at a much lower cost than current alternatives. 

 ALPHAGEOMETRY: AN OLYMPIAD-LEVEL AI SYSTEM FOR GEOMETRY (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 AlphaGeometry is an AI system that solves complex geometry problems
at a level approaching a human Olympiad gold medalist. It can solve 25
out of 30 Olympiad geometry problems within the standard Olympiad time
limit - the average human gold medalist solves 25.9 problems in the
same time. AlphaGeometry uses a neural language model with a
rule-bound deduction engine to find solutions. Its output is both
verifiable and clean and it uses classical geometry rules with angles
and similar triangles just as students do.

 BEWARE OF MISLEADING GPU VS CPU BENCHMARKS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Nvidia's RAPIDS project claims that cuDF, a GPU-based Pandas
replacement, is up to 80 times faster than Pandas. While these
speed-ups are impressive, they're also misleading. The benchmarks
compare against Pandas running on a single CPU core - while the Pandas
library is single-threaded, fixing this doesn't require using a GPU.
It also ignores costs - switching to a GPU may make things faster, but
they are significantly more expensive. GPUs may still be an
appropriate solution for some tasks, but it will require careful
experimentation to determine if they are right for the use case and
budget. 

 BRACE YOURSELF, IPV6 IS COMING (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AWS will start charging around $4 per month for IPv4 addresses on
February 1. While IPv6 is clearly a good thing, there are still
challenges to switching to it. The biggest challenge to global
adoption is ISP support. A lot of developer tools aren't set up for
IPv6 yet. If you want to ensure your company continues to run smoothly
after February 1, start making as many changes as possible now.

 I SPENT THE MORNING WITH THE APPLE VISION PRO (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Apple is giving select members of the media Vision Pro demos this
week. This article describes to readers what the experience is like.
The demo aims to walk through as many elements as possible in roughly
60 minutes, from face scans to the spatial desktop to movie watching,
while unfortunately skipping over gaming. The author wasn't fully
convinced the device was a compelling buy at $3,500 as the price is
prohibitively expensive for the majority of people interested in the
system and there is still a lack of Vision Pro-specific apps on the
system. 

 AMAZON REPORTEDLY UNSATISFIED WITH A PAID VERSION OF ALEXA, FACES
INTERNAL CONFLICT (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Amazon has been working on a paid subscription for Alexa, but there
have been company conflicts revolving around the new technology. Alexa
Plus will supposedly feature all the functionalities that the current
Alexa offers, but with a more personalized and conversational AI. It
is expected to launch on June 30. Amazon has been struggling to
improve the AI, which still provides inaccurate information, and
reduce costs.
