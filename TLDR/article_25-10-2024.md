 👀 INSIGHTS FROM 200 SENIOR IT LEADERS ON GENAI, TECH STACK, & MORE
INSIDE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The findings of this survey [4] of 200 senior analytics and IT
leaders reveal a significant gap between CIOs' aspirations and
execution capabilities.

While 70% have adopted GenAI, only 20% are using the tech in
productionized use cases, and many face soaring costs that overshadow
benefits, stressing the need for modernized analytics infrastructure
and better cost management.

Dive into the full survey report [4] for detailed insights and

 OPENAI PLANS TO RELEASE ITS NEXT BIG AI MODEL BY DECEMBER (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 OpenAI plans to launch its next frontier model, Orion, by December.
The model has been teased by an OpenAI executive as potentially up to
100 times more powerful than GPT-4. Orion will initially be released
to companies that OpenAI works closely with so they can build their
own products and features. Engineers inside Microsoft are preparing to
host the model on Azure as early as November. It is unclear if OpenAI
will call the model GPT-5, despite it being seen internally as GPT-4's
successor. 

 APPLE TEASES ‘WEEK' OF MAC ANNOUNCEMENTS STARTING ON MONDAY (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple SVP Greg Joswiak has teased a week of Mac announcements that
will start on Monday morning. Apple likely plans to announce a suite
of Macs powered by M4 chips, including a low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro,
high-end 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, a new iMac, and a new Mac Mini.
Russian YouTubers have posted videos of what looks to be new MacBook
Pros with M4 chips. Apple revealed its M3 chips and computers at an
event on Halloween last year.

 TSMC'S ARIZONA CHIP PRODUCTION YIELDS SURPASS TAIWAN'S IN WIN FOR US
PUSH (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) has achieved early
production yields at its first plant in Arizona that surpasses similar
factories back home. The share of chips manufactured at the facility
that are usable is about four percentage points higher than comparable
facilities in Taiwan. The yield is critical as it determines whether
companies will be able to cover the enormous costs of a chip plant.
The accomplishment is a sign of progress for US efforts to revitalize
local semiconductor manufacturing. 

 ANALYSIS: WHY ABU DHABI IS BETTING ON FUSION (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists appear to be on the verge of unlocking commercial fusion.
The technology would be a major inflection point if it can be deployed
at scale as it unlocks limitless, cheap energy. This would
significantly threaten the fossil fuel industry. As a major oil
exporter, the United Arab Emirates is not ignoring or undermining the
technology - it is investing in it, exploring how to secure access to
crucial fuels, and embedding itself into the fusion supply chain.

 HOW INTEL GOT LEFT BEHIND IN THE A.I. CHIP BOOM (10 MINUTE READ) [13]


 The story of how Intel got left behind in AI is representative of the
broader challenges the company now faces. The company missed
opportunities, made wayward decisions, and executed poorly. The trail
of missteps was a byproduct of a corporate culture born of decades of
success and high profits that was hard-changing and focused on its
franchise in personal computers and later in data centers. Its
corporate ethos worked against it as the company tried and failed
repeatedly to become a leader in chips for artificial intelligence.
