 OPENAI NEARLY DOUBLES VALUATION TO $157 BILLION IN FUNDING ROUND (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has raised $6.6 billion in new funding, with investors valuing
the startup at $157 billion. Investors in the round include Thrive
Capital, Microsoft, SoftBank, and Nvidia. The startup was last valued
at $86 billion early this year. Investors have the right to withdraw
their money if OpenAI fails to convert to a for-profit company within
two years. 

 DID APPLE JUST KILL SOCIAL APPS? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 iOS 18 will allow users to select which contacts to share with an app
instead of revealing their entire address book. Apple doesn't think
the change will hurt developers, but some startups have seen contact
sharing drop significantly since the iOS 18 change. The ability to
quickly connect new users with friends can mean the difference between
success and failure for apps. This change could mean friend-based
social apps may eventually be replaced by apps like TikTok which show
users content based on what they like rather than who they're
connected to.

 GOOGLE IS TAKING ITS RIVALRY WITH OPENAI TO ANOTHER LEVEL (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Teams at Google have made progress on software for AI models with
humanlike reasoning abilities in recent months. The company is using
chain-of-thought prompting, which allows large language models to
solve multistep problems using a series of intermediate reasoning
steps, to give models the ability to solve more complex math- and
company-programming-related inquiries. OpenAI's new o1 model also uses
chain-of-thought prompting. Google employees were worried last year
that the company had fallen behind in the AI race, but they are now
less concerned now that Google has unveiled more products to compete
with. 

 LARGEST BRAIN MAP EVER REVEALS FRUIT FLY'S NEURONS IN EXQUISITE
DETAIL (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers now have a map of the brain of a single female fruit fly
that includes nearly 140,000 neurons and captures more than 54.5
million synapses. The map was described in a package of nine papers by
a consortium known as FlyWire, which is co-led by neuroscientists Mala
Murthy and Sebastian Seung at Princeton University in New Jersey. It
has been in development for more than four years. The map shows how
neurons connect through chemical synapses but doesn't offer any
information about electrical connectivity between neurons or how
neurons chemically communicate outside synapses.

 AUTOMATTIC DEMANDED A CUT OF WP ENGINE'S REVENUE BEFORE STARTING
WORDPRESS BATTLE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Automattic asked WP Engine to hand over 8% of its revenue each month
in a deal sent on September 20. WP Engine was given the choice to pay
the 8% cut as a royalty fee to Automattic or as salaries for WP Engine
employees who would contribute to the WordPress.org open-source
project. It didn't accept the proposal as it believes that its use of
the WordPress trademark and 'WP' abbreviations meet fair use
guidelines. Automattic says that the main issue is over trademarks,
not the use of open source software. 

 HOW NORTH KOREA INFILTRATED THE CRYPTO INDUSTRY (28 MINUTE READ) [16]


 North Korean IT workers infiltrating tech companies rake in as much
as $600 million annually for the regime. Hiring and paying the
workers, even inadvertently, violates UN sanctions and is illegal in
the US and in numerous other countries. These workers have been
aggressively targeting crypto companies in particular. More than a
dozen crypto companies have admitted to accidentally hiring workers
from North Korea who used fake IDs, successfully navigated interviews,
passed reference checks, and presented genuine work histories.
