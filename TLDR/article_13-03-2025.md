 GOOGLE ANNOUNCES GEMINI ROBOTICS FOR BUILDING GENERAL PURPOSE ROBOTS
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Gemini Robotics is a vision-language-action (VLA) model by Google
DeepMind that aims to bring Gemini and AI to the physical world. It
was created to make general purpose robots that can perform a wider
range of real-world tasks than ever before. The VLA is built on Gemini
2.0 and has physical actions as an additional output modality for the
purpose of directly controlling robots. Google built its robotic AI
model to be able to understand and respond quickly to instructions or
changes in the environment, capable of the kinds of things people can
generally do with their hands and fingers, and adept with dealing with
new objects, diverse instructions, and new environments. A video
showing some of the model's capabilities is available in the article. 

 NEW INTEL CEO LIP-BU TAN WILL PICK UP WHERE PAT GELSINGER LEFT OFF (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Lip-Bu Tan will become the CEO of Intel on March 18. Former CEO Pat
Gelsinger was booted from the position on December 2 after several
quarters of losses, rounds of layoffs, and canceled or spun-off side
projects. Tan was previously on Intel's board from 2022 to 2024 and
has been a board member for several other technology and chip
manufacturing companies. Intel reported a loss of $18.76 billion in
2024, its first annual loss since 1986.

 LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES ARE REMAKING GOOGLE'S DATA CENTERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Google installed 100 million lithium-ion cells across its data
centers to provide backup power to its servers. The lithium-ion cells
hold twice the power and take up half as much space as the lead-acid
batteries they replaced, allowing the company to cut the number of
cells required by three-quarters - more space for servers. Batteries
are driving change in a myriad parts of the economy. Panasonic has
shipped over 10 billion cells from its Nevada plant since it opened in
2015. 

 GENERAL FUSION'S REACTOR PROTOTYPE CREATES PLASMA FOR THE FIRST TIME
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Canadian startup General Fusion has created plasma inside its
prototype reactor, a major milestone in proving its technology. The
company uses technology that dates back to the 1970s - details are
available in the article. The prototype is now forming plasmas daily -
the next step is to compress the plasmas with a lithium liner to
create fusion and heating from compression. The company hopes it will
achieve scientific break-even equivalent by 2026.

 I USE CURSOR DAILY - HERE'S HOW I AVOID THE GARBAGE PARTS (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This post discusses how to make the Cursor experience as good as
possible. It covers what to put inside the .cursorrules file, how to
get the best output, and more. One of the biggest factors in a
developer's experience with coding with AI is going to be what they
are coding and which tech stack they are using. One of the best things
about AI is that it can help developers tackle problems that would
normally be outside of their reach. 

 THE DUCKDB LOCAL UI (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The DuckDB team and MotherDuck have released a local UI for DuckDB as
part of the ui extension. The DuckDB UI uses interactive notebooks to
define SQL scripts and show the results of queries. It can show
databases, table summaries, notebooks, column insights, and more.

 SOMETHING IS ROTTEN IN THE STATE OF CUPERTINO (23 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 It was clear when Apple announced Apple Intelligence that some of its
features were more ambitious than others. Apple hinted strongly that
the various features wouldn't all ship at the same time - the more
trivial features would ship first. Its more ambitious features have
been delayed until sometime 'in the coming year'. Apple appears to
have pitched a story that wasn't true and set a course based on that. 

 THE CULTURAL DIVIDE BETWEEN MATHEMATICS AND AI (25 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The excitement around AI's potential contributions to mathematics
doesn't always come with a nuanced understanding of what mathematics
truly is and isn't. This post attempts to articulate these differences
and hopefully build a bridge for better collaboration. Most
mathematicians are not interested in AI creating new mathematics, but
in processing and organizing existing knowledge. Even if AI was able
to produce a proof of a major conjecture, it would fail to deliver the
deeper understanding that mathematicians truly seek.

 NVIDIA WON THE AI TRAINING RACE, BUT INFERENCE IS STILL ANYONE'S GAME
(5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Inference is a far more diverse workload compared to training -
performance is predominantly determined by memory capacity, memory
bandwidth, and compute - which of these is prioritized is heavily
dependent on a model's architecture, parameter count, hosting
location, and target audience. 

 THE MOST FORBIDDEN TECHNIQUE (30 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 You should only train a model on outputs, not on an analysis of its
outputs or on the technique used to analyze its outputs.
