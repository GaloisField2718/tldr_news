 SYSTEM METRICS ARE COOL. BUT WHY AREN'T YOU RUNNING DEVELOPER
SURVEYS? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 There are some questions only engineers can answer. _Do we have
proper tools for debugging production issues?_ is hard to answer just
from looking at cycle times. To understand how to improve developer
experience and productivity, you need to combine system metrics with
developer feedback [4].

Using Swarmia's survey feature [4], you can build recurring
engineering surveys by selecting relevant questions from a
research-backed survey framework [4].

Choose the questions you'd like to include in each survey to measure
the change in developer sentiment over time. Send automatic reminders
over Slack, [4] and keep everything secure with zero fuss.

 SLIM IPHONE 17 MODEL IS JUST A ‚ÄúSTEP TOWARD SOMETHING BETTER‚Äù (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is reportedly planning a slim iPhone model for next year. The
iPhone 17 'Air' will have a smaller Dynamic Island, an aluminum
chassis, a 6.6-inch display, and a lesser camera setup. It is designed
to look much cooler than the standard iPhone without the performance,
screen size, or cameras of a Pro model. The new slim model is expected
to be a bigger hit than the iPhone 12/13 mini and the iPhone 14/15/16
Plus. 

 AI IS MINING THE SUM OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE FROM WIKIPEDIA. WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN FOR ITS FUTURE? (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The proliferation of AI tools means there's a growing disconnect
between where people are getting their information and where it comes
from. This could affect contributions to Wikipedia in the long run as
people are less likely to contribute if they don't visit the site
directly. Wikipedia hasn't seen any decline in traffic due to AI so
far. Without clear attribution and source links, AI applications risk
introducing an unprecedented amount of misinformation into the world.

 NOVEL IDEAS TO COOL DATA CENTERS: LIQUID IN PIPES OR A DUNKING BATH
(7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nvidia's upcoming GB200 server racks will be mainly cooled with
liquid circulated in tubes. The company is also working on other
cooling technologies, including one that involves dunking entire
computers in a non-conductive liquid that absorbs and dissipates heat.
Cooling accounts for a significant amount of power consumption in data
centers. Liquid-cooled data centers would be able to pack much more
computing power in the same space. 

 621-MPH MAGLEV VACUUM TRAIN "T-FLIGHT" TEST SUCCESSFUL (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) has
successfully tested its ultra-high-speed maglev train under low vacuum
conditions. The test showed that all systems were nominal. CASIC plans
to run the train at its full 621 mph speed in the second phase of
testing, which will require an extended track. There may also be phase
3 tests targeting 2,485 mph.

 WHY I BET ON DSPY (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DSPy is an open source framework that helps developers compose
multiple large language model (LLM) calls together in a principled
manner to solve a problem. LLMs are good at pattern matching, matching
distributions, and being creative. DSPy uses this to create 'reasoning
systems' that can actually perform what they're supposed to. While
there are issues with the framework, there is a community behind the
project that is working together to improve it.

 WHAT GOOGLE RIVALS WANT AFTER DOJ'S ANTITRUST TRIAL WIN (5 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 While Google has been ruled as an illegal monopoly, the Department of
Justice has yet to announce what remedies it will seek. It has
previously indicated that any remedies would be structural, meaning
break-ups rather than mandates to change certain behaviors. Google
rivals have suggested changes such as choice screens that pop up
periodically, a ban on dark pattern popups that push people back to
the default, and barring Google from buying default status or
pre-installation and self-preferencing its own content in serve
results. The final decision will be at least as consequential as the
Microsoft antitrust case 23 years ago, which spurred an era of
unprecedented innovation that allowed promising startups to flourish -
including Google. 

 INDIVIDUAL EFFICIENCY VS ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY (11 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 In a perfect world, everyone would be able to use their own favorite
tools, but this doesn't always work out in real world settings where
teams have to work and collaborate together. While individual autonomy
should be the main goal, local optimization doesn't lead to global
optimization, which is what organizations should be aiming for. There
are many legitimate times when administrative needs should supersede
the individual. This article looks at when policies should optimize
for the efficiency and happiness of the individual and when they
should optimize for the team or company.
