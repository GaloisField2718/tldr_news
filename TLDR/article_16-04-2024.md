 üìî PROCESS ORCHESTRATION FOR TECHNICAL LEADERS (SPONSOR) [3] 

 Automation is high on the agenda for most organizations, but often
fails to materialize ‚Äî especially when processes are only automated
in a single software system, team, or device.
Even simple-sounding processes often follow a complex logic. That's
where process orchestration [3] comes in: coordinating the various
endpoints of a business process (people / systems / devices), or tying
multiple processes together.

This Process Orchestration Handbook [3] by Camunda [3] will help you
understand what you need for successful process orchestration, based
on real-world examples.

 TESLA WILL LAY OFF MORE THAN 10% OF GLOBAL WORKFORCE: READ THE ELON
MUSK MEMO (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk sent a memo to Tesla employees saying that the company will
lay off more than 10% of its global workforce. Tesla had 140,473
employees as of December 2023. Its shares have fallen 31% year to
date. Electric vehicle sales are gaining popularity worldwide, but the
company is facing more competition now than ever. It is also dealing
with other challenges, such as logistical problems caused by Yemeni
Houthi maritime attacks in the Red Sea and production suspension at
its gigafactory near Berlin due to suspected arson at a nearby
electricity substation. A copy of the memo from Musk is available at
the end of the article. 

 CYBERTRUCK OWNERS ALLEGE PEDAL PROBLEM AS TESLA SUSPENDS DELIVERIES
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla has canceled dozens of Cybertruck deliveries due to an
unexpected delay. The reason for the suspended deliveries is unknown.
There is some evidence that it may be due to an issue with the
electric pickup truck's accelerator. Several sources have reported
issues with sudden acceleration, with some pointing to possible causes
for the issue.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 LIMITLESS IS A NEW AI TOOL FOR YOUR MEETINGS ‚Äî AND AN ALL-HEARING
WEARABLE GADGET (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Limitless Pendant is a device that records everything its wearers
hear and then uses AI to help them remember and make sense of it.
Designed to be clipped onto a shirt or worn on a string around the
neck, it uses a beam-forming technology that can more clearly record
people around the user and not the rest of the room. The Pendant is
part of a system that uses data from different apps to provide users
with useful information. The company plans to eventually create AI
agents that do things on users' behalf. 

 GOT TINNITUS? A DEVICE THAT TICKLES THE TONGUE HELPS THIS MUSICIAN
FIND RELIEF (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lenire is a device that treats tinnitus using electrical stimulation
of the tongue. Approved by the FDA in March last year, the device
consists of a plastic mouthpiece with stainless steel electrodes. A
clinical trial found that 84% of participants who tried Lenire
experienced a significant reduction in symptoms. While the device
costs around $4,000, more than 80% of the participants in the clinical
trial said they would recommend the device to a friend with tinnitus.
It is unclear how long the benefits last as clinical trials have only
evaluated the device over a 1-year period.

 üçΩÔ∏è TAKE TESTING OFF YOUR PLATE (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Everyone wants higher test coverage. Cohere, AutoTrader, and Saleloft
actually achieved it. How? By partnering with QA Wolf (4.8 on G2) [9]:

	* End to end test coverage as a service.
	* Get 80% coverage in just 4 months [9].
	* 24-hour maintenance, on-demand test creation, unlimited parallel
runs (their infra), and zero flakes guaranteed.

Kiss bugs goodbye ü¶ã [9]

 INTRODUCING THE BATCH API (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's Batch API helps developers save costs and get higher rate
limits on async tasks such as summarization, translation, and image
classification. Developers just have to upload a file of bulk requests
and they'll receive results within 24 hours, with 50% off API prices.
A link to the Batch API reference docs is available. 

 REDKA (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Redka is Redis re-implemented with SQLite. The project aims to
reimplement the good parts of Redis with SQLite while remaining
compatible with Redis API. It features ACID transactions, SQL views
for better introspection and reporting, Redis-compatible commands and
wire protocol, and more. Redka does not support Lua scripting,
authentication and ACLs, multiple databases, watch/unwatch, Cluster,
or Sentinel.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LINUX FOUNDATION IS LEADING FIGHT AGAINST FAUXPEN SOURCE (6 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 The Linux Foundation is fighting against the rise of faux open source
licenses such as BSL and SSPL. It is actively promoting open source
projects such as OpenTofu and Valkey, whose faux open source parent
companies switched to more restrictive licenses after profiting on top
of open source projects. While some companies are ticked off by the
move, the Linux Foundation is simply defending the method these
businesses used to build their fortunes on in the first place. 

 CALIFORNIA IS LOSING TECH JOBS (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article takes a close look at how California's tech industry has
changed over the last few years as well as how this has impacted the
state itself and the rest of the tech industry in the US. Many of the
tech industry's traditional hubs have suffered significantly since
late 2022, with nowhere more so than California. The state has lost
its share of US employment across wide swaths of the tech industry.
Its share of jobs in subsectors like software publishing and computer
system design has fallen to some of the lowest levels on record. The
drop has been especially pronounced within Silicon Valley.
