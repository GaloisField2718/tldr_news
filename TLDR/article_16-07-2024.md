to put icons anywhere on the home screen, change app icon color, add
lock screen shortcuts for apps other than camera and flashlight, and

 ZERO TO BILLIONS: THE STARTUP ON THE VERGE OF THE BIGGEST TECH EXIT
IN YEARS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cloud cybersecurity company Wiz was founded four years ago by four
former Israeli military officers. It grew quickly to become the
dominant company in cloud cybersecurity and is headed toward the
largest exit for any tech startup since Rivian's $77 billion initial
public offering in November 2021. Google is looking to acquire the
company for a $23 billion sale price. The deal will likely draw
scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the US and EU.

 IMMUNOTHERAPY IS CHANGING CANCER TREATMENT FOREVER (39 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The human immune system is very good at attacking anything it
registers as a disease - if it could be turned against cancer, it
could eliminate tumors more thoroughly than surgery and more durably
than chemotherapy. Scientists have managed to modify T cells to react
to cancer as if it were a virus and destroy it. The therapy has been
used to remove glioblastomas, a common type of brain cancer with a
median time of diagnosis to death of just over a year. 

 WHERE'S THE SYNTHETIC BLOOD? (32 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The creation of synthetic blood is one of the holy grails of
biomedical research. There are two main approaches to making synthetic
blood products: the biologist's approach and the chemist's approach.
The biologist's approach involves coaxing stem cells into becoming
blood cells, while the chemist's approach synthesizes molecules and
particles that mimic the functions of blood cells. Both approaches
need to overcome economic and manufacturing challenges before they can
scale for use in patients.

 SCALE BY SPECTRAL COMPUTE# (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SCALE is a GPGPU programming toolkit that allows programs written
using the popular CUDA language to be natively compiled for AMD GPUs.
It accepts CUDA programs as is and serves as a drop-in replacement for
nvcc. SCALE acts as an installation of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, so it
will work with existing build tools and scripts. It offers opt-in
language extensions that can make writing GPU code easier and more
efficient. 

 WHY FACEBOOK DOESN'T USE GIT (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Facebook uses Mercurial instead of Git, building custom workflows on
top of the tool for performance. Facebook used Git years ago, but it
started facing performance issues, and the response from Git
maintainers wasn't cooperative, with the maintainers pushing back on
improving performance and instead recommending that Facebook shard its
monorepo. The Facebook team looked at its alternatives and chose
Mercurial, which had a community of maintainers who were welcoming to
changes made by them. The story shows how kindness and openness can go
far in the world of devtools.

 ASK HN: HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT FINDING A JOB? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [16] 

 This Hacker News thread takes a look at what the job market is
currently like, both for recruiters and job seekers. While many
respondents confirm that a lot of employment is found through direct
connections rather than through job postings, many companies still
require potential workers to go through the interview process. The
thread contains a lot of advice for job seekers from people who have
been successful at finding new employment during their careers.
