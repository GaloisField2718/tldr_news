 SPACEX TENDER OFFER SAID TO VALUE COMPANY AT RECORD $210 BILLION (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SpaceX will sell insider shares at $112 each in a tender offer that
values the company at close to $210 billion. The company was valued at
$180 billion in December. The new valuation is a record for an
American private company. It puts SpaceX on par with some of the
world's largest publicly traded companies by market capitalization.
Terms on the tender offer haven't been finalized - the size of the
offer could change depending on interest from both insider sellers and
buyers. 

 APPLE DEVELOPING NEW WAY TO MAKE IPHONE BATTERIES EASIER TO REPLACE
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is reportedly investigating 'electrically induced adhesive
debonding' technology to make iPhone batteries more replaceable. The
technology would allow a battery to be dislodged from its chassis with
a small jolt of electricity to the battery. It could debut with at
least one of the iPhone 16 models this year.

 PIPING UP AT THE GATES OF DAWN (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Astronomers have found a galaxy that was already shining with intense
starlight when the universe was only 290 million years old. The
earliest, most distant galaxy yet found, JADES-GS-z14-0 is one of a
string of discoveries enabled by the James Webb Space Telescope that
challenge conventional models of how the first stars and galaxies
formed. The discovery proves that luminous galaxies were already in
place 300 million years after the Big Bang and are more common than
what was expected. Galaxy formation models will need to address the
existence of such large and luminous galaxies so early in cosmic
history. 

 GERMAN FIRM SYNHELION OPENS ‚ÄòWORLD'S 1ST' INDUSTRIAL SOLAR FUEL
PLANT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 DAWN is a project from Synhelion that aims to remove the dependency
on fossil fuels from the transport sector, particularly in aviation.
It uses a 65-foot-high solar tower surrounded by a mirror field that
concentrates solar rays to produce synthetic fuels using solar heat.
The tower has an energy storage system that allows it to generate
solar fuel even when there's no sunlight. DAWN is scheduled to begin
production in the latter half of the year. Synhelion says DAWN will
produce several thousand liters of fuel per year.

 LEARNING FROM POPUP VILLAGES (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Some popup villages have seen hundreds of people from the internet
gather for multiple months at a time. These gatherings are long enough
to build relationships but short enough to not require permanent
relocation. People can join these communities for however long they
want, creating an opportunity for a demand-first approach to
prototyping permanent places. This essay looks at successful popup
villages, why they work, and where they could go next. 

 OPENAI'S NEW ‚ÄúCRITICGPT‚Äù MODEL IS TRAINED TO CRITICIZE GPT-4
OUTPUTS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 CriticGPT is a new AI model from OpenAI designed to identify mistakes
in code generated by ChatGPT. Based on the GPT-4 family of large
language models, it analyzes code and points out potential errors,
making it easier for humans to spot mistakes that might otherwise go
unnoticed. CriticGPT was trained on a large number of inputs
containing deliberately inserted mistakes. Its capabilities extend
beyond just code review - it is able to identify errors made by
ChatGPT in some other tasks as well. OpenAI plans to integrate
CriticGPT-like models into its RLHF labeling pipeline to provide its
trainers with AI assistance.
