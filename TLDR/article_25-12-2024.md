 APPLE JOINS GOOGLE ANTITRUST FIGHT TO PROTECT $20B SEARCH PARTNERSHIP
(4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is seeking to intervene in Google's US antitrust trial over
online search, saying that Google can no longer adequately represent
its interests in the case. The company has concerns over its
multi-billion dollar revenue-sharing agreement with Google. Apple
received an estimated $20 billion from Google in 2022 for making
Google the default search engine on Safari. The trial could
potentially force Google to divest its Chrome browser or Android
operating system to restore competition in the online search market. 

 GOOGLE IS USING ANTHROPIC'S CLAUDE TO IMPROVE ITS GEMINI AI (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Google contractors working to improve Gemini are comparing its
answers against outputs produced by Anthropic's Claude. It is unknown
whether Google has permission for its use of Claude in testing against
Gemini. Anthropic's terms of service forbids customers from accessing
Claude to build competing products or services or train competing AI
models without approval. Google is a major investor in Anthropic.

 NASA SPACECRAFT JUST PLUNGED INTO THE SUN AND BROKE STUNNING RECORDS
(6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Parker Solar Probe swooped through the Sun's atmosphere early on
Christmas Eve. Flying around 3.8 million miles above the solar
surface, the probe was designed to explore how solar storms are
formed. It is fitted with instruments to measure and image solar
winds, which may enable us to better forecast when and where a potent
coronal mass ejection or solar flare may hit. Solar storms have huge
implications for energy grids and communications systems on Earth. 

 UNITREE B2-W ROBOT DOG GETS UPGRADED, CAN NOW PERFORM A HANDSTAND (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Unitree B2-W robot dog can now do handstands thanks to a few
upgrades, including high-powered wheel motors, M107 joint modules, and
replaceable wheel/foot legs. It is equipped with a 32 wire
automotive-grade LiDAR, a depth camera, and an ultra large 2200Wh
battery, and can achieve a top speed of 12.4 miles per hour. It can
travel 31 miles with an 88 pound load and pull up to 220 pounds. A
video of the robot dog performing tricks is available in the article.

 AUTHORTRAIL (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 AuthorTrail lets users explore Git repositories' history by author.
It can find and browse files users have contributed to. Once found,
users are able to quickly access to view and edit them. AuthorTrail
features file search by author email, hierarchical file tree
visualization, a built-in code viewer with syntax highlighting, quick
open in the default editor, and dark mode support. 

 ASK HN: PROGRAMMERS WHO DON'T USE AUTOCOMPLETE/LSP, HOW DO YOU DO IT?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [10] 

 Many IDE features, like autocomplete, language servers, and Copilot,
can be taken for granted today. However, not every developer uses
these tools. Some developers work in environments where they aren't
able to access IDEs (for example, on remote servers that only have
Vim), so they have had to learn different ways of doing things.
Organizing software in a way where every piece of code has a clear and
logical place is a skill - tooling that helps with code navigation can
result in code that lacks structure.

 HOW TO (HOPEFULLY ETHICALLY) MAKE MONEY OFF OF AGI (38 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 This article contains an interview with Will Eden from Cosmos, Zvi
Mowshowitz (an economist who spent 2.5 years trading at Jane Street
Capital), and Noah Kreutter, who has roughly four years of quant-y
finance experience at IMC and Bridgewater. The interview covers how to
construct a portfolio that will go well when Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) becomes a bigger deal, the broad market effects of
AGI, career capital in an AGI world, debt in interest effect of AGI,
and much more. The interview was in November last year - the
interviewer recently posted an update showing that the investment
advice in the interview backtested well. 

 I SENSED ANXIETY AND FRUSTRATION AT NEURIPS'24 (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Late-year PhD students and postdocs at NeurIPS'24 expressed anxiety
and frustration as the job market looks and feels very different from
what they expected when they were applying for PhD programs five or so
years ago. Years ago, competition for artificial intelligence
researchers with PhDs was fierce - companies were recruiting them to
prepare themselves for a revolution. Many of the researchers, who were
paid well, were free to choose what they wanted to work on and publish
whatever they wanted to publish. This incentivized a large number of
brilliant students to apply to PhD programs. Universities have started
to train undergraduate, graduate, and master's students on these
technologies, making PhDs less valuable to companies.

 ASK HN: HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN A CAREER BREAK OR GAP YEAR TO HACK?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [14]
