SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 ON A QUEST TO REVIVE THE WOOLLY MAMMOTH, COLOSSAL BIOSCIENCES HAS
CREATED A WOOLLY MOUSE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Colossal Biosciences has genetically engineered mice to have
mammoth-like fur using CRISPR. The mices' fur is of a color, texture,
and thickness that resembles a mammoth's fur. The woolly coat may
enable the mice to survive in cold climates. While the company
believes that it will be eventually possible to re-create the woolly
mammoth, there are still a lot of technical hurdles ahead. 

 NASA USES GPS ON THE MOON FOR THE FIRST TIME (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost has successfully demonstrated the
ability to use Earth-based GPS signals on the Moon. Accurate and
reliable navigation will be vital for future missions to the Moon.
NASA currently tracks spacecraft using a mix of onboard sensors and
Earth-based tracking signals, which generally requires oversight from
a team of engineers. Using GNSS could reduce the need for human
operators as the signals can be autonomously picked up by spacecraft.

 ARCH GATEWAY (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Arch Gateway handles the critical but pesky tasks related to the
handling and processing of prompts, including detecting and rejecting
jailbreak attempts, intent-based routing for improved task accuracy,
mapping user requests into 'backend' functions, and managing the
observability of prompts and LLM API calls in a centralized way.
Several demo apps, as well as a quick start guide, are available in
the repository. 

 TRIMODAL NATURE OF TECH COMPENSATION IN THE US, UK, AND INDIA (28
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The US is unique in having a tier above Big Tech. Across the UK,
India, and the Netherlands, the highest compensation is Big Tech, but
in the US, hedge funds, quant firms, and top scaleups can pay more.
However, these positions are usually reserved for workers already in
Big Tech, and switching can be difficult. It's a lot harder now to get
into top-tier companies in today's tough job market.

 AUTOMATTIC CEO MATT MULLENWEG TALKS SUCCESSION — ‘I DON'T WANT TO
PASS IT TO A COMMITTEE' (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Matt Mullenweg intends to stay as CEO at Automattic, but he's been
thinking of a succession plan for the company. Mullenweg doesn't want
to pass WordPress onto a committee but rather to another CEO who will
continue to act as a steward to the WordPress community. He says the
most 'iconic' companies are those where the executive has retained
some majority in voting control, something he is considering in his
succession planning. Automattic has helped boost the adoption of
WordPress by introducing more than 100 million people to the software.
