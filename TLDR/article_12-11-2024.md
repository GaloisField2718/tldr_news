 AI PROTEIN-PREDICTION TOOL ALPHAFOLD3 IS NOW OPEN SOURCE (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The software code for Google DeepMind's AlphaFold3 is now publicly
available for free for non-commercial applications. AlphaFold3 is
capable of modeling proteins and other molecules. It was originally
published without code or model weights, which drew criticism from
scientists who said the move undermined reproducibility. Several other
companies have also released open-source protein structure prediction
tools based on AlphaFold3's specifications. 

 LG HAS A STRETCHABLE DISPLAY THAT CAN EXPAND BY 50 PERCENT (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 LG has unveiled a stretchable display that can expand up to 50% and
freely transform into any shape. The display uses tiny micro-LED light
sources and has a 100-pixel-per-inch resolution. It can be stretched
more than 10,000 times. The technology, which opens up the possibility
for entirely new types of interfaces, could be widely applied in
industries such as fashion, wearables, and mobility. Pictures and a
video of the display being stretched are available in the article.

 SPACEX DRAGON GIVES ISS A HELPING HAND WITH ALTITUDE (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 SpaceX's Dragon reboosted the International Space Station (ISS) with
a 12-minute, 30-second burn of the freighter's Draco thrusters. The
burn adjusted the orbit of the ISS, proving that SpaceX's Dragon can
be used in the same way as the Roscosmos Progress spacecraft and
Northrop Grumman's Cygnus. The ISS requires regular reboosts to
prevent it from tumbling back to Earth. It is expected to be retired
in 2030, but there is a possibility the station's life will be
extended a few more years. 

 SCIENTISTS MAKE MIND-BLOWING BREAKTHROUGH IN BATTERY SAFETY WITH
PROTOTYPE THAT ACTUALLY WORKS WHEN CUT: 'THE BATTERY CONTINUES TO
FUNCTION' (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Chinese battery researchers have developed two lithium-sulfur
batteries, one that remains stable after 300 charge/discharge cycles
and another that provides power after being cut in half or folded. The
batteries' resilience is due to a unique cathode coating.
Lithium-sulfur batteries have the potential to be cheaper than
lithium-ion alternatives, but they can take hours to charge. The
breakthrough could lead to safer batteries and make lithium-sulfur
technology more mainstream.

 HOW I SHIP PROJECTS AT BIG TECH COMPANIES (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Shipping is a different skill to writing code. Projects do not
automatically ship - someone has to take up the difficult and delicate
job of shipping them. It's important to have one person on the team
who has an end-to-end understanding of the whole project. This article
discusses what shipping is and how to do it properly. Shipping is hard
- it has to be the top priority to be successful. 

 ALL THE DATA CAN BE YOURS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article presents tips for finding and using undocumented APIs.
GitHub's code search tool is a powerful way to look for potential
endpoints. Parts of pages that load after the rest of the page or
actions that don't cause a full page refresh are likely making
requests to JSON APIs. All WordPress sites have a built-in REST API
for accessing posts, pages, media, and more. Other tips include
looking at the site's robots.txt file, searching Google, reading and
debugging JavaScript, and looking through the site's mobile app.

 Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high above $82,000. Recent political
victories signal a favorable environment for cryptocurrency in the

 THE DEATH AND LIFE OF PREDICTION MARKETS AT GOOGLE (27 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Google has hosted two different internal platforms for predictions

worldwide were sent home due to COVID-19. Prediction markets have been
