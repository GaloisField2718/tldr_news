MINUTE READ) [9]

and many tissues. The gut has its own network of nerve cells that can
function nearly independently from the brain. Just like the brain, it
is made up of two types of nervous system cells, neurons and glia. A
new study has identified a new subset of glial cells that senses food
as it moves through the digestive tract and signals the gut to
contract and move it along its way.
