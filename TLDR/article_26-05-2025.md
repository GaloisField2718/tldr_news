 WORKOS AUTHKIT + RADAR: AUTHENTICATION WITH REAL-TIME THREAT
PROTECTION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Authentication isn't just login. It's building secure flows, managing
sessions, handling tokens, supporting SSO, and protecting user data.
AuthKit [5] provides a fully hosted, customizable UI for sign-up,
password resets, MFA, and seamless SSO — production-ready from day
one.

But authentication alone doesn't stop abuse. WorkOS Radar [6] adds
real-time threat prevention, detecting brute force, credential
stuffing, and more. Built-in protections can be enabled instantly —
no scripts or custom logic required.

Build secure, scalable authentication from day one with AuthKit and
WorkSO Radar. [7]

 THE MAN WHO ‘A.G.I.-PILLED' GOOGLE (56 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Demis Hassabis, the chief executive of Google DeepMind, has been
dreaming of artificial general intelligence (AGI) for years. He was
already taking the possibility of AGI seriously when Google acquired
DeepMind in 2014. Today, he is among a growing number of tech leaders
racing to build AGI. Hassabis and a colleague received the Nobel Prize
in Chemistry last year for their work on AlphaFold, an AI system
capable of predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins.
This article contains a transcript of an interview with Hassabis about
his views on AGI and the future that follows its arrival. 

 NVIDIA PUSHES FURTHER INTO CLOUD WITH GPU MARKETPLACE (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Nvidia's DGX Cloud Lepton is a new service designed to link
artificial intelligence developers with Nvidia's network of cloud
providers, including CoreWeave, Lambda, and Crusoe. It provides access
to Nvidia's graphics processing units, making those chips more widely
accessible to all developers. The platform will have a marketplace of
GPU cloud vendors that developers can pick from to train and use their
AI models. Developers can choose which cloud provider to work with and
even work with multiple cloud providers.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 ROBOTS ARE STARTING TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE OPERATING ROOM (11
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Autonomous robots aren't being used to operate on people yet, but the
technology is almost capable of such a feat and more autonomy is on
the way. The technology could help hospitals meet the high demand for
safety and consistency during surgeries, manage routine tasks, and
prevent mistakes. Future robots will use AI to autonomously manage
movements and decision-making during surgical tasks, reducing the need
for constant human input. With the number of surgeons around the world
declining while the number of people who need surgery continues to
increase, the need for the technology is clear. 

 VALVE CEO GABE NEWELL'S NEURALINK COMPETITOR IS EXPECTING ITS FIRST
BRAIN CHIP THIS YEAR (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Starfish Neuroscience, a brain-computer interface startup
incorporated by Valve co-founder and CEO Gabe Newell, plans to produce
its very first brain chip later this year. The company is currently
seeking collaborators to open up avenues for the technology.
Starfish's goal is to create a smaller and less invasive implant than
the competition that can enable simultaneous access to multiple brain
regions. Details from the chip's current spec sheet are available in
the article. The article also links to a video of a talk from Valve
that explains how the technology could enhance gaming.

 STUFF I LEARNED AT CARTA (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Will Larson worked at Carta as its CTO for the past two years. This
post contains the most important lessons Larson learned in his time at
the company, covering topics such as engineering strategy, large
language model adoption, multi-dimensional tradeoffs, creating
software quality, and more. 

 OPENAI: SCALING POSTGRESQL TO THE NEXT LEVEL (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Bohan Zhang, a member of OpenAI's Infrastructure team, recently
shared the company's best practices with PostgreSQL at the PGConf.dev
2025 Global Developer Conference. The talk offers a glimpse into the
database usage of one of the most prominent unicorn companies and
demonstrates how PostgreSQL can scale gracefully under massive read
loads. OpenAI utilizes managed databases on Azure, employing a classic
PostgreSQL primary-replication architecture without sharding. This
article covers the content of Zhang's talk along with comments and
includes some more details about OpenAI's infrastructure.

 AT AMAZON, SOME CODERS SAY THEIR JOBS HAVE BEGUN TO RESEMBLE
WAREHOUSE WORK (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 As AI spreads through the labor force, many white-collar workers say
their work is becoming more routine, less thoughtful, and much
faster-paced. Companies seem to be persuaded that AI can increase
productivity. Teams are getting smaller, but they're being expected to
output the same amount of work by using AI. Managers say that AI can
relieve employees of tedious tasks and enable them to perform more
interesting work, but for inexperienced workers, the change resembles
the shift from artisanal work to factory work in the 19th and 20th
centuries. 

 ASK HN: GO DEEP INTO AI/LLMS OR JUST USE THEM AS TOOLS? (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [15] 

 Large language models are becoming commodities. Many people use them,
but few people are developing them from scratch. Developing large
language models involves a lot of hardcore computer science and math -
people can use them without having to know any of the internals. While
it might be helpful to understand some of the internals and math, it's
probably best to stick to learning how to get good at using these
models and integrating what they do into agentic systems.
