BIG TECH & STARTUPS

 YOU KNEW IT WAS COMING: GOOGLE BEGINS TESTING AI-ONLY SEARCH RESULTS
(4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google may soon just tell users what's on the Internet instead of
showing them. The company is expanding its AI search features and
testing a more substantial change in the form of AI Mode - a version
of Google that will only show AI results. Google insists that helping
people discover content online remains central to its approach, but AI
Mode won't show organic results - it is designed to operate in a
conversational way, so users will have to refine their search or ask
follow-up questions. The experimental feature is only available for
Google One AI Premium subscribers. 

 MACBOOK AIR GETS THE M4, A NEW BLUE COLOR, UP TO 32GB OF RAM, AND A
$100 PRICE CUT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's MacBook Air lineup has been upgraded with the M4 chip. There
are no major changes to the laptop's physical design, screen specs,
keyboard, or ports. The 13-inch M4 MacBook Air will start at $999 and
the 15-inch model will cost $1,199. The baseline configurations will
come with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and the 8-core version of the
M4's GPU. The new MacBook Airs will have a 12-megapixel Center Stage
camera and a new color option, Sky Blue.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 YES, WE ARE ABOUT TO BE TREATED TO A SECOND LUNAR LANDING IN A WEEK
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 It was 18,700 days, or 51 years, between the time when the Apollo 17
mission landed on the Moon and when Intuitive Machines' Nova-C
Odysseus lander did on February 22, 2024. While Intuitive Machines'
lander top toppled over, it still completed most of its scientific
experiments. Firefly's Blue Ghost stuck its landing last weekend,
making it two landings in slightly more than a year. Intuitive
Machines plans to send a second Nova-C lander, Athena, to the Moon
this afternoon - if successful, that would be three US landers in 377
days. 

 ADVANCED ROBOTIC SURGERIES ARE MINIMALLY INVASIVE, HELPING PATIENTS
HEAL FASTER (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Robot surgeries account for around 22% of surgeries nowadays. The
method offers less bleeding, less time in the hospital, and faster
recovery time with less pain. These robots are machines operated by
highly trained and experienced surgeons that remotely operate arms
that hold tiny surgical instruments. Using robots allows surgeons to
comfortably maneuver in places that are otherwise quite restrictive.
The technology is not only becoming more widespread, it is also
becoming more advanced - it may be possible one day to have robots
operating independently.

 BUSINESS OBSERVABILITY: METRICS, USE CASES, AND BEST PRACTICES
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 Telemetry can tell you more than technical performance. Business
observability adds commercial context to your log data, allowing you
to extend traditional observability by incorporating business
performance as an additional output. Find real world use cases [9],
examples, and an actionable implementation framework in this Datadog
eBook [9]. 

 LYNX: UNLOCK NATIVE FOR MORE (7 MINUTE READ) [10]

truly native UIs for both mobile and web from a single code base. It
can deliver vibrant and engaging UIs for large-scale apps with its
speedy, versatile rendering engine, performance-driven dual-threaded
UI programming, and modern Rust-based tooling. Lynx is designed for
diverse use cases and rich interactivity. Examples of UIs made with
Lynx are available in the article. 

 AIDER: USING UV AS AN INSTALLER (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Aider CLI Python utility uses an innovative solution to help end
users install it in an isolated virtual environment without first
needing to teach them what an 'isolated virtual environment' is. It
uses the uv Rust binary to install aider-chat, which in turn installs
a brand-new standalone copy of Python 3.12 and puts it into uv's own
managed directory structure where it shouldn't hurt anything else.
There's more to it, and more advanced users may opt for an alternative
installation mechanism, but the pattern is a very tasteful way of
getting everything working for non-expert Python users with minimal
risk of breaking their systems.

 DIGG FOUNDER TEAMS UP WITH FORMER REDDIT RIVAL TO BUY AND REVIVE
WEBSITE (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian is helping Digg make a comeback.

undisclosed sum. The new Digg plans to differentiate itself in the
social media market by focusing on AI innovations designed to enhance
the user experience and build a human-centered alternative. The
platform will prioritize transparency, reward human effort, and foster
enriching discussions. It will not just be a Digg or Reddit clone. 

 A STUDENT USED AI TO BEAT AMAZON'S BRUTAL TECHNICAL INTERVIEW. HE GOT
AN OFFER AND SOMEONE TATTLED TO HIS UNIVERSITY (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Columbia University student Roy Lee managed to land internships at
Amazon, Meta, and TikTok using a simple AI program. He had originally
planned to get a degree to work in Big Tech, but training for
technical interviews killed his passion for the job, which led him to
create the program. Columbia University has scheduled a disciplinary
hearing for Lee's stunt, but he will not be attending - Lee plans to
leave the university, saying that the program he built is proof that
the jobs Big Tech are offering are becoming obsolete.
