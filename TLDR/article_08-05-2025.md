 YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE SIDES IN THE CLOUD WARS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 60% of IT leaders say cloud complexity is their biggest challenge.
Endless debates about cloud providers aren't helping. Instead of
religious battles over public vs. private, Aptum takes a pragmatic
approach [4] of putting each workload where it makes sense.

Here's how Aptum's Hybrid Cloud approach [4] works:

✅ Some things belong in the cloud. Some don't. You'll get UNBIASED
ADVICE on what goes where.

✅ 24/7 HUMAN SUPPORT that can range from on-demand guidance to full
infrastructure management.

✅ One portal to manage your entire hybrid environment from a single
place with clarity and control - NO VENDOR SILOS.

 APPLE WILL ADD AI SEARCH IN MOBILE SAFARI, CHALLENGING GOOGLE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple plans to shift the focus of mobile Safari's search experience
to AI search engines. Searches in Safari fell for the first time ever
last year due to people increasingly using large language model-based
solutions. Google and Apple shares dropped after Apple's plans were
revealed as investors fear that the deal that makes Google the default
search engine may not last. It is unlikely an AI search engine will
become the default as the technology still needs to improve,
particularly when it comes to indexing. 

 STRIPE BRINGS STABLECOIN ACCOUNTS TO MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stripe is launching USDC and USDB accounts in 101 countries. The new
stablecoin-funded accounts will help Stripe facilitate cross-border
transactions between businesses. The accounts will also support
balances held in British pounds, euros, and US dollars. Stripe has
also announced a profiles feature to help businesses find each other
and verify their identities and a tool to make it easy for developers
to embed artificial intelligence agents into their products.

 AMAZON SAYS NEW WAREHOUSE ROBOT CAN ‘FEEL' ITEMS, BUT WON'T REPLACE
WORKERS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amazon's new warehouse robot has a sense of touch, allowing it to
handle jobs previously only done by humans. Vulcan has an innovative
gripper that can manipulate 75% of the one million unique items in
inventory at Amazon's Spokane warehouse. Vulcan will not be used to
replace people - Amazon will create new, higher-skilled jobs. The
robot can handle items up to 8 pounds and operate for 20 hours a day. 

 GOOGLE AGREES TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THREE NEW NUCLEAR SITES (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Elementl Power has signed an agreement with Google to develop three
project sites for advanced reactors. Each site will generate at least
600 megawatts of power capacity. Google will have the option to buy
the power once the sites are up and running. Elementl has yet to
choose the type of reactor it will use. It plans to choose the reactor
technology that's furthest along in development when it is ready to
begin construction.

 FIGMA INTRODUCES ‘VIBE-CODING' AI SOFTWARE DESIGN FEATURE (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Figma Make is an artificial intelligence feature that automates the
process of building websites and applications. It will be available
starting at $16 per person per month when purchased annually - there
is no free tier. The tool uses Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model. It
is currently being tested. There is no information on when it will be
released. 

 THE MAGIC OF SOFTWARE; OR, WHAT MAKES A GOOD ENGINEER ALSO MAKES A
GOOD ENGINEERING ORGANIZATION (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Many of today's best practices were drawn from long-established
internet companies like Google. However, the problem with copying its
current practices on the basis of its success is that most of those
companies found near-invincible business models, and so almost any
practice developed or selected at random likely would continue to be
successful to some degree. The practices and cultures that have
developed at these companies more often reflect optimizations for the
benefit of various decision makers rather than optimizations for
actually creating something great. The qualities that make a good
engineer are often the same ones that create good engineering
organizations - both start with deep understanding as the basis for
innovation and recognize that vision and engineering are often deeply
intertwined and mutually informative rather than linear.

 KNOW YOUR ENEMY: HOW THREE YEARS AT MCKINSEY SHAPED MY SECOND STARTUP
(7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Zac Townsend was an Associate Partner at McKinsey. This post talks
about the reasons he joined the company, his time there, the projects
he worked on, and the lessons he learned from the experience. After
working there for three years, Townsend learned that it is impossible
to fix institutions that have gotten too big - there are too many
people, too many processes, and too much regulatory overhang. This led
him to create his own company. 

 WORKING WITH LLMS: A FEW LESSONS (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Large Language Models (LLMs) are inherently probabilistic, which
means you have to add evaluation frameworks, human-in-the-loop
processes, and design for graceful failure, using LLMs for
probabilistic guidance rather than deterministic answers. Unlike with
traditional software, there is no way to get better at using AI than
using AI - there is no substitute for trial and error. This makes it
hard to predict development and makes building future-proof technology
almost impossible. While software is inexpensive to distribute once
written, LLMs have continued costs.
