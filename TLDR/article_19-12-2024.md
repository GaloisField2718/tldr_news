 U.S. SUPREME COURT AGREES TO HEAR CHALLENGE TO TIKTOK BAN (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on a law that would
effectively ban TikTok if ByteDance doesn't sell it. TikTok is arguing
that the law violates the US Constitution's free speech protections.
Oral arguments are scheduled for January 10, nine days before the law
is set to take effect. Congress passed the law due to concerns that
TikTok's Chinese ownership presented a national security risk. 

 APPLE HALTS EFFORT TO BUILD IPHONE HARDWARE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple has halted work on a project to build an iPhone hardware
subscription service. The service would have allowed customers to pay
a monthly fee and receive a new phone each year. It would have
competed with Apple's wireless carrier partners, who rely on
installment programs to sell devices and retain customers. Apple may
have canceled the program due to stricter rules by the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau.

 FIRST BABY CONCEIVED VIA BREAKTHROUGH FERTILITY TECH BORN (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Gameto's Fertilo procedure differs from traditional IVF because it
takes ovarian support cells derived from human induced pluripotent
stem cells and co-cultures them with an immature egg to mimic the
natural egg maturation process in the lab. It significantly improves
egg maturation and embryo formation. The procedure avoids 80% of the
hormone injections that traditional IVF requires and reduces the
duration of a treatment cycle to three days. The first live human baby
conceived using the technique was recently born. Gameto has partnered
with Australian IVF clinic chain IVFAustralia to make the procedure
available to patients at select clinics throughout the country. 

 AFTER DECADES OF TALK, SEAGATE SEEMS READY TO ACTUALLY DROP THE HAMR
HARD DRIVES (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Seagate has been experimenting with heat-assisted magnetic recording
(HAMR) since at least 2002. The company is set to release HAMR hard
drives based on its Mozaic 3+ platform in standard drive sizes.
Getting from the theoretical concept of HAMR to an actual drive
required countless engineering hours. Seagate has not released prices
yet, but the product page for the Exos M shows 30 and 32TB capacities.

Copilot Chat is limited to 50 chat messages. 

 GENESIS (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Genesis is a physics platform designed for general purpose
Robotics/Embodied AI/Physical AI applications. It comprises a
universal physics engine, a lightweight and user-friendly robotics
simulation platform, a powerful and fast photo-realistic rendering
system, and a generative data engine that transforms user prompts into
various modalities of data. The project is aimed at lowering the
barrier to using physics simulations, unifying a wide spectrum of
state-of-the-art physics solvers into a single framework, and
minimizing human effort in collecting and generating data for robotics
and other domains.

 AMAZON'S RTO DELAYS EXEMPLIFY WHY WORKERS GET SO MAD ABOUT MANDATES
(4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Despite mandating that office workers start working in the office
five days a week starting in January, Amazon still doesn't have enough
office space to accommodate its employees. The company has delayed
return-to-office dates for personnel in at least seven cities. Some
offices won't have sufficient space until April or May. Amazon claims
that most employees will have office space by January 2 and that most
of the pushed-back return-to-office days are related to buildings
being laid out differently for part-time workers rather than
insufficient physical space.
