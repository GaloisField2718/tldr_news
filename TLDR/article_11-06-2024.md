 APPLE WWDC 2024: THE 13 BIGGEST ANNOUNCEMENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple announced AI features and major updates across its operating
systems at its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote. Apple's AI
system, Apple Intelligence, will put powerful generative models at the
core of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. It will enable new capabilities
across Apple's native apps, such as the ability to generate images or
summarize text. Apple Intelligence will be available for free on the
iPhone 15 Pro and on iPads and Macs with an M1 or later chip. Other
announcements at the event include more customization in iOS 18, RCS
support for the iPhone, a Passwords app to keep track of logins, and a
Calculator app for iPadOS 18. 

 APPLE IS BRINGING RCS TO THE IPHONE IN IOS 18 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's Messages app will support RCS in iOS 18. It will replace SMS
as the default communication protocol between Android and iOS devices.
RCS offers typing indicators, read receipts, longer messages, and
higher-quality images and videos. Apple likely integrated the protocol
to appease EU regulators.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 WE JUST BROKE GROUND ON AMERICA'S FIRST NEXT-GEN NUCLEAR FACILITY (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Kemmerer, Wyoming, will soon be home to the most advanced nuclear
facility in the world. It will hopefully come online in 2030. There is
still a review process to be completed - TerraPower will build out the
non-nuclear parts of the facility in the meantime. Started by Bill
Gates in 2008, TerraPower is leading the country and the world in
developing safe, next-generation nuclear technology. 

 SOLAR-POWERED PLANES TAKE FLIGHT (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Solar-powered planes could lead to new alternatives for aerial
surveillance and telecommunications. Aviation giants,
telecommunication companies, venture investors, and the military are
already spending millions of dollars developing the technology. These
planes never need refueling and can stay in the air as long as the sun
is shining. Advances in battery technology have finally made it
feasible to power a solar plane through the night.

 THE FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING HIRING PROBLEM (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 When hiring for functional programming languages, you primarily pick
from either resume spammers, bright undergraduates, or senior
engineers who only want to work with that particular language. Resume
spammers can be safely ignored. Bright undergraduates can be a source
of great potential. Senior engineers who only want to work with a
particular language may look like the best candidates, but they may be
too focused on the tool to see the goals of the business. 

 PAYMENTS 101 FOR A DEVELOPER (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This page contains a list of terms and core concepts for developers
in the payments team of an online business or payments service
provider. It can be frustrating to work in an environment without
understanding the terminologies used in every conversation. The page
attempts to simplify the concepts to bring developers up to speed with
payments.

 APPLE'S AI PROMISE: ‚ÄúYOUR DATA IS NEVER STORED OR MADE ACCESSIBLE
TO APPLE‚Äù (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple's new Apple Intelligence system will use Private Cloud Compute
to ensure any data processed on its cloud servers is protected in a
transparent and verifiable way. Many of Apple's generative AI models
can run entirely on a device powered by an A17+ or M-series chip. When
a bigger model is required to fulfill a generative AI request, Apple
Intelligence only sends relevant data to complete the task to special
Apple silicon servers. Customer data will not be saved for future
server access or used to further train models. The server code used
for Private Cloud Compute will be publicly accessible. 

 STUDY FINDS A QUARTER OF BOSSES HOPED RTO WOULD MAKE EMPLOYEES QUIT
(4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A study of more than 1,500 employees found that a quarter of
executives and a fifth of HR professionals hoped that return-to-office
(RTO) mandates would result in staff leaving. While people did quit
when RTO mandates were enforced at many of the largest companies, it
wasn't enough - many of the layoffs in the past 12 months were
believed to be a result of too few people leaving in protest of RTO
mandates. Many employees feel that management wants them back in the
office to monitor them more closely. This has resulted in the growth
of an office culture that is even more performative, suspicious, and
divisive than before the COVID-19 pandemic.
