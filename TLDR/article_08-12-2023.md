 GOOGLE‚ÄôS BEST GEMINI DEMO WAS FAKED (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The video demonstrating some of Google Gemini's best interactions may
not be entirely real. While Gemini appears to be able to do the things
that Google shows in the video, it isn't able to do them live and in
the way the video implies. The video was a series of carefully tuned
text prompts with still images selected to mislead viewers about the
speed, accuracy, and fundamental mode of interaction with the model. A
breakdown of the video is available in the article. 

 BEEPER MINI FOR ANDROID SENDS AND RECEIVES IMESSAGES, NO MAC SERVER
REQUIRED (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 It is now possible to send iMessages without handing over Apple

Mini for Android allows Android users to send iMessages with all the
typing, delivered/read receipt, emoji reaction, and most other
iPhone-to-iPhone message features. The app is powered by a teenager's
reverse-engineering discovery. This article looks at how the app
works.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 CHINA LAUNCHES WORLD‚ÄôS ‚ÄòMOST ADVANCED‚Äô NUCLEAR REACTOR THAT‚ÄôS
COOLED BY GAS, NOT WATER (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 China has begun operations at a nuclear reactor that uses gas rather
than water for cooling. Construction of the plant started in 2012 and
its first reactor was connected to the country's power grid in 2021.
Interest in gas-cooled reactors is increasing globally as they can
provide efficient and cost-effective electricity. They can also
produce high-temperature process heat for industrial applications.
Pictures of the power plant are available in the article. 

 DEFYING CAVITY: LANTERN BIOWORKS FAQ (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lantern Bioworks claims to have a cure for tooth decay. It has a

the past. One treatment with the bacteria is enough to infect users'
mouths forever. This article contains an interview with Lantern
founder Aaron Silverbook where he explains how the technology works,
both in a biological and economic sense.

engineering through the Data Engineering Lifecycle and enrich their
understanding and practice.

 BROWSING THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE PERSONAL WEB (32 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Japanese Personal Web, or as they call it, creative/doujin sites,

them to similar sites from the West. The Personal Web is still very
alive in the East, with many sites surviving for over a decade or two.

of faraway stars in three dimensions and allow them to start
developing theories based on three-dimensional models.
