 AI PHONE CALLS ARE GETTING RIDICULOUSLY GOOD (SPONSOR) [4] 

 ‚òéÔ∏è Are phone-based jobs about to go extinct?

Bland AI released its hyper-realistic AI phone agent [4] earlier this
year. Guess what? It's already replacing support agents and SDRs for
some of the world's largest businesses ‚Äî handling up to 1M+
simultaneous phone calls.

And the performance is SCARY GOOD [4]. The AI answers instantly,
understands emotions, and responds in virtually any voice and even any
language.

ü§Ø Chances are, you've already spoken to it without even noticing...

Pretty wild, huh? Here, give it a call yourself [4].

And if you're an enterprise customer, you can get TLDR-exclusive
access to the most advanced version [5]...

 SUNK COST (32 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 NFTs haven't recovered despite crypto values rising. While they're
hanging on, the technology is in troubled waters. OpenSea, once the
largest marketplace for NFTs, is facing pending litigation from the
SEC, a previous unreported 'matter' with the FTC, inbounds from US and
international tax authorities, heightened competition, accusations of
gender discrimination, and employee attrition. This article tells the
story of the marketplace's rise and fall. 

 OPENAI REPORTEDLY IN TALKS TO CLOSE A NEW FUNDING ROUND AT $100B+
VALUATION (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise funds at a valuation of more
than $100 billion, substantially higher than the company's previous
$86 billion valuation. Investors include Thrive Capital and Microsoft.
The financing will be OpenAI's biggest outside infusion of capital
since Microsoft invested nearly $10 billion in January last year.
While OpenAI's revenue eclipsed $3.4 billion early this year, the
company is on track to lose nearly $5 billion by year end. It has
already burned through $8.5 billion on AI training and staffing.

 SPARKS ARE FLYING DAY AND NIGHT AS SPACEX PREPS STARSHIP PAD TO CATCH
A ROCKET (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Workers have been making last-minute upgrades to SpaceX's Starship
launch pad in South Texas pretty much every day for the last couple of
weeks. If all goes well on the Starship's next test flight, the launch
pad's mechanical arms will close together to capture the Super Heavy
booster as it descends back to Earth. SpaceX announced that Starship
and Super Heavy were ready to fly, pending regulatory approval, on
August 8. The FAA is still evaluating SpaceX's proposed flight
profile. It is unclear how long approval will take, but the state of
the launch pad suggests that the next test is still at least a couple
of weeks away. 

 AI INFERENCE COMPETITION HEATS UP (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The competition for AI inference is heating up, particularly in terms
of power efficiency. ML Commons has released the results of its latest
AI inferencing competition. The round included first-time submissions
from teams using AMD Instinct accelerators, the latest Google Trillium
accelerators, chips from Untether AI, and Nvidia's new Blackwell chip.
This article looks at the results - while Nvidia's chips are still
ahead in many categories, chips from other manufacturers are starting
to catch up.

 PROGRAMMING WITH CHATGPT (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Using ChatGPT to code can be a real productivity boost. Instead of
reading examples on Stack Overflow and adapting them to their
particular case, developers can instantly get code tailored to their
specific needs. It can make developers more efficient, but they need
to remember that it is still a tool. It is important to always test
the code it provides to quickly discover any hallucinations. 

 STATE AND TIME ARE THE SAME THING (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 State is time and time is state. The only way to see the passage of
time is by measuring changes in observable state. Changes in state
matter in that they create new times. If a state update is purely
internal and cannot affect the observable state, then it doesn't
advance time. This model can be used to reason about abstract systems.

 NVIDIA REVENUE JUMPS 122% IN POSITIVE SIGN FOR TECH'S A.I. BOOM (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Nvidia recently reported that its sales and profits had more than
doubled during the last quarter. The company also projected that sales
in the current quarter will increase by 80% compared to a year ago,
exceeding earlier estimates. Nvidia's revenue was $30.04 billion last
quarter, and its net income rose to $16.95 billion. It will spend $50
billion on repurchasing its own shares. Nvidia now supplies more than
90% of the chips essential to building AI, but competition is on the
rise, with other companies developing custom chips to lessen their
dependence on Nvidia. 

 TELEGRAM CEO CHARGED WITH NUMEROUS CRIMES AND IS BANNED FROM LEAVING
FRANCE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has been indicted in France on charges
including web-mastering an online platform in order to enable an
illegal transaction in an organized group, complicity in drug
trafficking, distribution of child pornography, and providing
cryptology services without making required declarations to government
officials. Telegram has released a statement saying that it follows
the law and industry standards on moderation and that it was absurd to
claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for the abuse of
that platform. Durov was ordered to post bail of 5 million euros. He
is forbidden from leaving the country and must report to police twice
a week while the case continues.
