 😘 KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. But getting that kind of coverage—and staying there—is
hard and pricey for any size team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native service SUPPORTS WEB AND MOBILE APPS,
delivering 80% automated test coverage in weeks [6] and helping teams
SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles to minutes.

With QA Wolf, you get:

✅ Unlimited parallel test runs

✅ 15-min QA cycles

✅ 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation

✅ Zero-flake guarantee

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] saw 4x more test cases
and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 SAMSUNG LAUNCHES THIN S25 EDGE AS APPLE REPORTEDLY PREPARES THE
IPHONE ‘AIR' (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Samsung has unveiled a thin version of its flagship smartphone called
the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. The device is 5.8 millimeters thin and
weighs 163 grams. It will go on sale on May 30, starting at $1,099.
Samsung may be trying to get ahead of Apple, which is gearing up to
launch the iPhone 17 Air. 

 WHY MODERNA MERGED ITS TECH AND HR DEPARTMENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Moderna's merging of technology and human resources into a single
function is a sign of how artificial intelligence will change the
workforce. The company is redesigning teams based on what work is best
done by people versus what can be automated with technology. It has
developed over 3,000 tailored GPTs designed for specific tasks like
dose selection for clinical trials and drafting responses to questions
from regulators. As a result, roles are being created, eliminated, and
reimagined.

 A NEW ERA IN CANCER THERAPIES IS AT HAND (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 CAR-T cells are modified cells used in a form of immunotherapy that
involves changing parts of the immune system into cancer-attacking
instruments. It is one of the most promising modern cancer treatments.
While some studies have linked the therapy to fatal complications, new
therapies are beginning to surpass those challenges and provide safer,
more targeted delivery directly to tumors. Improving on these
strategies might lead to treatments for even the most resistant types
of cancer. 

 NEW MEXICO'S SPACEPORT AMERICA LOOKS UP AND INTO THE FUTURE (7 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Spaceport America, a purpose-built commercial spaceport with 6,000
square miles of restricted airspace, has plans to further grow its
launch complex. The company is currently expanding access roads and
plans to build a hanger that acts as a security center, STEM education
center, office and conference area, and center for handling small
vehicle and payload processing. Spaceport America is currently working
on a reentry license so it can do capsule return and other types of
returns. Being an inland spaceport, it will never have the throughput
that the Cape in Florida has, but it is a good alternative for quick
small to medium-sized launches.

 HYPER-TYPING (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Hyper-typing, the act of making typings so complex that it makes them
almost unusable, is becoming a trend in the TypeScript ecosystem.
While there are very good reasons for using types, hyper-typing is a
slippery slope that ends in a place where things work, and they might
also look good for the caller, but the resulting types are a complex
mess and the compilation errors produced are walls of inscrutable
text. Less accurate and less safe libraries might be dumber, but
working with them is overall more enjoyable, and the resulting code is
more understandable and maintainable. 

 STARGUARD (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Fake stars are rampant and supply chain attacks are rising. StarGuard
is a command-line tool for detecting fake-star campaigns, dependency
hijacks, license red flags, and other signals of open-source risk. It
was designed to automate open-source due diligence so it can be done
in seconds. StarGuard only uses public metadata (unless a token is
provided) and it doesn't execute any code.

 APPLE CONSIDERS RAISING IPHONE PRICES, WITHOUT BLAMING TARIFFS (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apple is considering price increases for its fall iPhone lineup. It
is determined to avoid any scenario in which it appears the price
increases are attributed to US tariffs on goods from China. The US and
China agreed yesterday to suspend most of the tariffs they had imposed
on each other. Chinese factories will continue to handle the bulk of
production for Apple's most profitable and high-end phones. While
Indian factories are capable of producing Pro models, the country's
infrastructure and technical capabilities are not yet able to support
mass production at the same scale as China. 

 ELON MUSK'S BORING COMPANY IS IN TALKS WITH GOVERNMENT OVER AMTRAK
PROJECT (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Federal Railroad Administration is in discussions with the Boring
Company to see whether it can help with a multi-billion-dollar Amtrak
project. The firm told officials that it could find ways to build the
tunnels needed for the project more cheaply and efficiently. The
Boring Company is one of several firms being consulted for the
project. No decision has been made on bids yet.
