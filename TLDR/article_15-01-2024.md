through a lengthy sales pitch that includes a 25-minute in-store
demonstration on how to use the headset. More than a dozen demo units

 HOW THREADS WILL INTEGRATE WITH THE FEDIVERSE (38 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Fediverse consists of small social networks that can be hosted by
an individual or company whose users can communicate and interact with
users on other similar networks. This article details how Meta plans
to integrate Threads with the Fediverse. Meta engaging positively with
its user base is difficult due to its size. Integrating with the
Fediverse will let Meta step back and focus instead on engaging with
organizations that represent the interests of the Fediverse.

 SOME HIGHLIGHTS ON THE STARSHIP SIDE OF THE ALL HANDS (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Starship's second flight almost made it to orbit - if it had a
payload, that payload would have made it to orbit. SpaceX thinks it
has a good shot at reaching orbit with the third flight. It will then
focus on achieving full and rapid reusability. There are two towers at
Starbase so one can be upgraded while the other is used for launches. 

 NEW ANTHROPIC PAPER: SLEEPER AGENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Anthropic recently trained large language models to act secretly
malicious. It found that despite best efforts at alignment training,
deception still slipped through. The alignment training only made
models look safe. Anthropic's research shows how standard safety
training might not actually ensure safety and might end up giving
people a false sense of security.

 HIDDEN CHANGES IN GPT-4, UNCOVERED (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Recent changes made to ChatGPT's GPT-4 interface significantly
altered the model's web browsing tools. The changes prevent the model
from directly citing quotes from webpages and limits viewing of full
content. This article analyzes the underlying mechanism of GPT-4 web
browsing, the hidden changes, and their implications. OpenAI is
increasingly under scrutiny regarding copyright laws and the
reproduction of content on the internet. These changes seem to be
aimed at eliminating the issue.

 INSTAGRAM‚ÄôS CO-FOUNDERS ARE SHUTTING DOWN THEIR ARTIFACT NEWS APP
(1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Artifact, a news app created by Instagram's co-founders, is shutting
down a year after launch. The app used an AI-driven approach to
suggest news users might like to read. The company decided that the
market opportunity for the app wasn't big enough to warrant continued
investment. Artifact will still let users read news until the end of
February, but users can no longer add new comments or posts. 

 MY AI TIMELINES HAVE SPED UP (AGAIN) (30 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article is an update to a post in 2020 that made predictions on
when artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be achieved. It
defines AGI as an AI system that matches or exceeds humans at almost
all economically valuable work. The previous post predicted a 10%
chance by 2035, but this has now changed to a 10% chance by 2028 and a
25% chance by 2035. The author believes there is a 90% chance that
humans will develop AGI by 2070.
