 OPENAI STRIKES REDDIT DEAL TO TRAIN ITS AI ON YOUR POSTS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has signed a deal that will grant it access to real-time
content from Reddit's data API. The deal will allow OpenAI to surface
discussions from Reddit within ChatGPT and other products and enable
Reddit to bring new AI-powered features to users and mods. OpenAI has
also signed up to become an advertising partner on Reddit. It is
unclear what the financial terms of the deal are and whether it
involves access to training data. 

 TIKTOK TESTS 60-MINUTE VIDEO UPLOADS AS IT CONTINUES TO TAKE ON
YOUTUBE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A limited group of TikTok users in select markets are now able to
upload 60-minute videos onto the platform. The feature marks a shift
from TikTok's original format. While the company rose to popularity
due to its short-form video format, it has been slowly embracing
long-form content to compete with YouTube. The platform has also been
testing a horizontal full-screen mode and video-scrubbing thumbnails.
It is unclear if or when TikTok plans to launch the 60-minute video
upload option widely.

 THE LONGEST CLINICAL TRIAL YET OF BLOCKBUSTER WEIGHT LOSS DRUG WEGOVY
REVEALS SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A study on semaglutide that assessed around 17,600 adults in multiple
countries from 2018 to 2021 found that participants lost an average of
10% of their body weight. 17% of the participants left the trial due
to side effects that included nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and
constipation, which were most often felt during the initial months of
treatment. The drug reduced major cardiovascular events by 20% - this
effect was evident even in participants who didn't lose weight. The
study suggests the drug could be potentially used for other purposes
and could help make a case for more widespread insurance. 

 FEMTOSECOND LASERS CREATE 3-D MIDAIR PLASMA DISPLAYS YOU CAN TOUCH (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Laser-induced plasma displays ionize air molecules to create glowing
points of light. Japanese researchers have created a laser plasma
display that is safe to touch. It uses femtosecond lasers, which
create a pulse duration so minuscule that it doesn't result in any
appreciable skin damage unless fired at the same spot at one shot per
millisecond for a duration of 2,000 milliseconds. Touching the plasma
produces a physical sensation, as if the light has a physical
substance. The displays are still very small, but researchers suggest
that it is possible to scale them with different optical devices. A
video explaining the system and showing holograms generated by the
display being touched is available in the article.

 REACT COMPILER (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 React Compiler is an experimental compiler that automatically
optimizes React apps. It is a build-time-only tool that works with
plain JavaScript. React Compiler understands the Rules of React, so
developers don't need to rewrite any code to use it. The compiler also
includes an eslint plugin that surfaces analyses from the compiler
inside editors. React Compiler is still new and not yet fully ready
for production.

 This post discusses a process for building high-quality interactive
embedding visualizations for a variety of different kinds of entity
relationship data. It provides observations about what works and what
doesn't and a background on embeddings and embedding visualizations.
Embedding visualizations are useful for targeted searches and they are
fun to browse around and explore.

 OPEN SOURCE IS NEITHER A COMMUNITY NOR A DEMOCRACY (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Using open source software doesn't entitle one to a vote on the
direction of that project. Democratic decision-making never existed in
the open source world. The majority of open source projects are run by
a small group of core contributors who advance the project, review
patches, and guard the integrity of the vision. Open source is first
and foremost a method of collaboration between programmers who show up
to do the work. It is not a program for users to get free stuff or a
seat at the table where decisions are made. 

 THE MAKER OF STABLE DIFFUSION IS COLLAPSING, CONSIDERING SALE (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Stability AI is in big financial trouble and is in talks to be sold
off. The company generated less than $5 million in revenue in the
first quarter of this year while losing more than $30 million. It is
reportedly sitting on $100 million worth of outstanding bills. The
company lost its CEO Emad Mostaque in March and it is currently facing
legal troubles over using Getty Images' intellectual property to train
AI models.
