 GOOGLE SCRAMBLES TO MANUALLY REMOVE WEIRD AI ANSWERS IN SEARCH (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 There are many examples on social media of Google's new AI Overview
product saying weird stuff. Google is now racing to manually disable
AI Overviews for specific searches. The company has been testing AI
Overviews for a year now, with over a billion queries served in that
time. It says that examples seen on social media have been uncommon
queries and that there were also examples that were doctored or
unreproducible. 

 ELON MUSK PLANS XAI SUPERCOMPUTER (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 xAI is planning to build a supercomputer to power the next version of
its Grok AI chatbot. Elon Musk says he wants to get the proposed
supercomputer running by the fall of 2025. xAI could be partnering
with Oracle for the project. When completed, the supercomputer will be
at least four times the size of the biggest GPU clusters that exist
today. Musk estimates that running the Grok 3 model and beyond will
require 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.

 SPACEX SETS DATE FOR NEXT STARSHIP FLIGHT, EXPLAINS WHAT WENT WRONG
THE LAST TIME (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX is targeting June 5 for its next Starship test flight. The
highly anticipated flight seeks to demonstrate the Super Heavy stage's
ability to make a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico. It also aims for
the Starship upper stage to make a controlled reentry through the
Earth's atmosphere before falling into the Indian Ocean. The Super
Heavy first stage failed to make a soft landing in previous attempts
due to a blockage in a filter in the Raptor engines. The Starship
upper stage lost the ability to control its altitude during its coast
phase in space due to clogged valves used by its reaction control
thrusters. 

 'ABSOLUTE MIRACLE' BREAKTHROUGH PROVIDES RECIPE FOR ZERO-CARBON
CEMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Old concrete can be recycled in steel-processing furnaces to purify
iron, producing 'reactivated cement' as a byproduct. The process
produces completely carbon-zero cement if renewable energy is used.
The resulting concrete has similar performance to the original
material. The technique doesn't add major costs to either concrete or
steel production and it significantly reduces CO2 emissions compared
to the usual methods of making both. Industrial-scale trials of the
technology are set to begin soon.

with an excerpt. Commenters on the post have also linked additional
essays to read. 

 WHY YOU SHOULDN'T USE AI TO WRITE YOUR TESTS (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Tests are not always valuable - tests written by AI are even less
valuable because the tests are derived from the code and they aren't
written with intent. AI may be able to write higher-level tests that
focus on feature coverage. It may also be useful for writing AI tests
to fuzz apps, translating acceptance criteria into tests, and writing
code that fits tests.

 AMAZON CLOUD BOSS MATT GARMAN INHERITS BUSINESS UNDER PRESSURE TO
KEEP PACE IN AI (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Matt Garman, a veteran AWS executive who most recently led sales and
marketing, is now taking the helm at the cloud services provider.
Amazon has yet to emerge as a leader in generative AI despite throwing
billions of dollars behind Anthropic and rolling out its own large
language models. Growth at AWS also decelerated to 13% in 2023,
reflecting more conservative spending by businesses on IT and cloud
services. While the company remains the leader in cloud
infrastructure, Microsoft is quickly closing the gap. 

 WHERE ARE THE BUILDERS? (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There are now fewer entrepreneurs in their 20s on a path to outlier
success than there were in previous decades. This could be because
their attention is being taken up by things like games and TikTok, or
they may have so little free time they no longer have original ideas.
The tech industry could be getting too good at consumer app
optimization, which may be producing undesirable outcomes when paired
with adoption at a enough age.
