 OPENAI EX-EMPLOYEES WORRY ABOUT COMPANY'S CONTROL OVER THEIR MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS IN SHARES (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Many of OpenAI's early employees are sitting on millions of dollars
worth of equity. The only way for them to realize any value from this
equity in the near term is through secondary stock sales. OpenAI has
told employees that it will try to hold one tender offer roughly every
year depending on how both the company and the market are faring at
the time. Current and former employees are increasingly concerned
about access to liquidity after reports that the company has the power
to claw back vested equity. The company has used aggressive tactics to
get employees to sign exit agreements that affect the future of their
stock holdings. 

 X IS ABOUT TO START HIDING ALL LIKES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 X is rolling out private likes - what users like on the platform will
be hidden by default. Owner Elon Musk said that it was important to
allow people to like posts without getting attacked for doing so.
Users will still be able to see who liked their posts and the like
count for all posts.

 AN EXPERIMENTAL ALZHEIMER'S DRUG OUTPERFORMS ONE JUST APPROVED BY THE
FDA (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The experimental drug donanemab slowed the progression of Alzheimer's
disease by about 35% in a study of more than 1,700 people. Eli Lilly,
the company that makes the drug, has submitted the results of its
study to the Food and Drug Administration, which is expected to make a
decision on the drug by the end of the year. The drug is still not a
cure - its benefits amount to only about a seven-month delay in the
loss of memory and thinking. The drug caused dangerous swelling or
bleeding in the brain in about 25% of patients. 

 STOKE SPACE IGNITES ITS AMBITIOUS MAIN ENGINE FOR THE FIRST TIME (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stoke Space has fired its first stage rocket engine for the first
time, briefly igniting it for about two seconds. The test was a
success as the engine performed nominally. Stoke's two-stage Nova
rocket will be fully reusable and have a lift capacity of about 5
metric tons. It could be ready for its first flight in 2026.

 GENERATIVE AI IS NOT GOING TO BUILD YOUR ENGINEERING TEAM FOR YOU (27
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Software is an apprenticeship industry - you can only learn by doing.
The industry changes fast, so developers have to keep learning. It
takes many years to forge a competent software engineer. Senior
software engineers don't only write code - they have to be able to
understand, maintain, explain, and manage a large body of software in
production over time and translate business needs into technical
implementation. Writing code is the easiest part of software
engineering, and it's getting easier every day. AI can help generate
lots of code really fast, but it can't aid in the work of managing,
understanding, or operating that code. Generated code can't be trusted
- it needs to be reviewed before it can be committed and shipped to
production. 

 ORACLE JAVA POLICE START KNOCKING ON FORTUNE 200'S DOORS FOR FIRST
TIME (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Oracle has dispatched Java audit letters to Fortune 200 companies for
the first time. The company announced a new licensing regime in
January 2023 that was two to five times more expensive for businesses
with limited Java use. Companies should be wary, evaluate their
positions, and only pay for Java where necessary. Signing up for a
long-term agreement may hold customers hostage to fortune when it
comes to renewal.

 THE VOTE ON ELON MUSK'S $46 BILLION PAY PACKAGE IS COMING DOWN TO THE
WIRE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The vote on Elon Musk's $46 billion Tesla pay package is still too
close to call. Shareholders are expected to finish voting on Thursday.
Musk has been personally campaigning for the vote, even attending
meetings with some large investors that he usually skips. To
incentivize voting, Tesla has been offering a raffle for a chance of a
tour of its Texas production plant with Musk. It launched a video with
voting instructions last week that featured its Optimus humanoid
robot.
