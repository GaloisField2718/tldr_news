 CHINA DISCUSSES SALE OF TIKTOK US TO MUSK AS ONE POSSIBLE OPTION (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves
Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok. The plan involves X
taking control of the platform and running the businesses together. It
is unclear whether Musk, TikTok, or ByteDance have held any talks
about the terms of any possible deal. TikTok may no longer be in
ByteDance's sole control. Chinese officials recognize that they will
face tough negotiations with the Trump administration, so they see the
TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation. 

 USERS WORRIED ABOUT TIKTOK BAN APPEAR TO BE DOWNLOADING A DIFFERENT
CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA APP (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Chinese social media app RedNote is at the top of Apple's app store.
RedNote is often thought of as the Chinese equivalent of Instagram.
The company was founded in 2013 and had about 300 million monthly
active users in July 2024. It was valued at $17 billion in July - it
has raised over $900 million in total funding and has more than 2,000
employees. Many TikTok creators are rushing to find an alternative
platform where they can keep posting videos while waiting to see what
happens with TikTok, which faces a potential ban on January 19.

 STARLINK IS NOW CHEAPER THAN LEADING INTERNET PROVIDER IN SOME
AFRICAN COUNTRIES (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Starlink, now available in more than 100 countries, is cheaper than
the leading fixed internet service provider in at least five of the 16
African countries where the service is available. The company does not
offer fixed rates - it instead adjusts prices to reflect market
conditions. Its satellites are able to provide services where
ground-based internet infrastructure is sparse or nonexistent.
Starlink has disrupted the existing internet service provider industry
in Kenya, where it became so popular that the company had to pause new
subscriptions due to network overload. 

 BEZOS' HUGE NEW ROCKET LAUNCH SHUT DOWN MINUTES BEFORE LIFTOFF (3
MINUTE READ) [12]

mission was scrubbed right before it was scheduled to launch. The
company is now troubleshooting a vehicle subsystem issue and reviewing
opportunities for its next launch. Blue Origin still has until January
16 to launch before the currently approved launch window elapses. Its
New Glenn rocket has faced many setbacks during its over a decade of
development.

 THE PYTORCH DEVELOPER'S GUIDE TO JAX FUNDAMENTALS (9 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 JAX is a high-performance numerical computing library with a
NumPy-like API. While many PyTorch users have heard about JAX, there
are not that many straightforward, easy-to-follow tutorials. This
tutorial helps readers understand the basics of JAX by connecting its
concepts to PyTorch building blocks. It explores the basics of the JAX
ecosystem from the PyTorch user and guides users through how to train
a simple neural network with JAX and PyTorch. 

 O1 ISN'T A CHAT MODEL (AND THAT'S THE POINT) (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 o1 is not a chat model - it's like a report generator: give it enough
context, tell it what you want outputted, and it'll often nail the
solution in one shot. People often approach chat models by starting
with a simple question and some context, iterating back and forth
until the desired output is achieved. o1 needs as much context as
possible otherwise it will just take questions at face value and won't
try to pull context from the user. The most effective way to use o1 is
to treat o1 like a new hire, give it as much context as possible, and
focus on explaining what you want the output to be.

 THANKS TO NVIDIA, THERE'S A NEW GENERATION OF PCS COMING, AND THEY'LL
BE RUNNING LINUX (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Nvidia's Project Digits will be powered by DGX OS, a customized
Ubuntu Linux 22.04 distro. The desktop combines Nvidia's Blackwell GPU
with a 20-core Grace CPU built on the Arm architecture. It can develop
up to 1 petaflop of AI performance at FP4 precision and support
200-billion-parameter large language models. Nvidia's partnership with
MediaTek will likely lead to a new generation of AI-powered PCs with
significantly enhanced capabilities. 

 WORDPRESS IS IN TROUBLE (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Automattic has announced that it will restrict its contributions to
the open source version of WordPress - it will now put in about 45
hours a week in total, down from nearly 4,000 a week. The company is
aiming to match the estimated hourly contributions of WP Engine as a
response to WP Engine's legal response after actions by WordPress
co-creator Matt Mullenweg. While usually, having the community take
the lead would be fine, Mullenweg has the final say over some very
important parts of the WordPress community. While it is fair for
Automattic to focus on for-profit projects, Mullenweg still holds all
the keys to WordPress. A fork is possible, but it will require new
community-driven infrastructure.
