IN NORTH AMERICA (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla employees are now required to install and show customers how to
use the latest version of the company's Full Self-Driving (FSD)
premium driver assistance system before completing a vehicle delivery
in North America. All Tesla vehicles have a standard driver assistance
system called Autopilot. The FSD option costs $199 per month for most

 ADAM NEUMANN MAKES A $500 MILLION BID FOR WEWORK THAT COULD HIT $900
MILLION IF FINANCING AND DILIGENCE FIRM UP (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adam Neumann, former WeWork CEO, has submitted an unsolicited bid in
excess of $500 million to acquire WeWork out of bankruptcy. The bid
could potentially go up to $900 million pending due diligence. It is
unclear how Neumann will finance the offer. The bid may make WeWork's
bankruptcy proceedings more complex. The company is seeking to walk
away from some of its longer-term commitments in less lucrative
markets, but some of its lessors are fighting these efforts.

 AS AI BOOMS, LAND NEAR NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS BECOMES HOT REAL ESTATE
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Land near power plants is set to become a hot commodity due to AI.
Several data center operators, including AWS and Microsoft, have
explored nuclear-powered options for their operations. While most
projects are looking to build on the land surrounding nuclear plants,
some projects, like Microsoft's, are exploring the idea of installing
tiny modular plants to power existing data centers. While small
modular reactors are not yet ready for production, there are still
more than 400 reactors around the globe to collocate with. 

 INKJETS ARE FOR MORE THAN JUST PRINTING (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Inkjet technology has found a host of applications beyond putting
dots on paper. It can now be used to make DNA microarrays for
genomics, create electrical traces for printed circuit boards, and
build 3D-printed structures. The technology could eventually also be
used for personalized medicine and the development of advanced
batteries. This article looks at the history of the technology, how it
developed, as well as what the future holds for inkjet systems.

 THE BEST ENGINEERING INTERVIEW QUESTION I’VE EVER GOTTEN (12 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 This blog post discusses a programming challenge from a software
engineering interview. memcached, an in-memory key-value store,
provides a built-in way to atomically add k to a number, but it
doesn’t provide other arithmetic operations - there is no 'atomic
multiply by k' operation. The challenge required interviewees to add a
`mult` command to memcached. The challenge is well calibrated for
interviews as there is only one correct answer and it is also a good
representation of what most real-world programming is like. 

 FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS EXPORT TO CSV (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 CSV is common in the data science space as it is human-readable, less
verbose than options like JSON and XML, and super-easy to produce from
almost any tool. However, the format is usually underspecified and CSV
files have terrible compression and performance. There are many file
formats more suitable for working with tabular data. This post looks
at one of them, Apache Parquet, and shows how it is better in both
compression and performance with examples.

Developers who want to enter the iOS ecosystem have to go through the
App Store and abide by its rules and restrictions. This article looks
at the facts of the case against Apple, which directly attacks Apple's
core differentiation: its deep integrations across its devices.
