 OPENAI UNVEILS EASY VOICE ASSISTANT CREATION AT 2024 DEVELOPER EVENT
(4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI unveiled four major API updates for developers on Monday at
its DevDay 2024 event in San Francisco. The most notable new API
feature is the Realtime API, which enables developers to build
features similar to ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode into their
applications. It streamlines the process of creating voice assistants
so developers can handle speech recognition, text processing, and
text-to-speech conversion with a single API call. The other API
updates enable developers to fine-tune smaller and cheaper models from
more advanced models, speed up inference by remembering frequently
used prompts, and fine-tune models using images.

 HOW GOOGLE TRIED TO UNRAVEL THE DOJ'S AD TECH CASE (6 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The Department of Justice has just wrapped up a trial where it argued
that Google has created illegal monopolies in the ad tech market.
Google has a variety of defenses, ranging from Supreme Court precedent
to security concerns. One of its biggest arguments was that the agency
doesn't understand advertising and that it was slicing up the market
in a way that doesn't make sense. Google also claims the agency is
ignoring Google's biggest advertising competition, social media. The
trial will resume for closing arguments on November 25.
