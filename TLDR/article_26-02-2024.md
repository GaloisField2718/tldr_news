 TESLA SHARES MORE FOOTAGE OF OPTIMUS WALKING IMPROVEMENTS (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Tesla's latest clip of its Optimus humanoid robot shows it smoothly
walking around one of its testing facilities. The robot can currently
walk at around 0.6 meters per second, a 30% speed boost compared to
the robot's last appearance. Tesla is aiming for the robot to be
eventually able to walk up to five miles per hour. A link to the video
is available in the article. 

 GOOGLE SAYS MICROSOFT OFFERED TO SELL BING TO APPLE IN 2018, BUT
SEARCH-QUALITY ISSUES GOT IN THE WAY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A document from Google's antitrust case against the US Justice
Department revealed that Microsoft offered to sell its Bing search
engine to Apple several times over the past few decades, with Apple
declining the offer over quality issues every time. Microsoft's almost
$100 billion investment into Bing over 20 years was not enough to
create a product comparable to Google's. Google's case centers over
whether the company has a monopoly in web search. Microsoft's CEO
previously testified that he has focused every year of his tenure as
CEO to see if Apple would be open to a default search arrangement for
Bing.

Protocol (atproto), a federated protocol for large-scale distributed

organization due to its federated nature - various parts of the system

 LESSONS FROM MY THIRD YEAR RUNNING A SAAS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This post summarizes a developer's learnings from three years of
running a SaaS app. In three years, their product had grown from a toy
to something people were paying for. The developer learned to stop
being afraid of success and calmed down on their software releases and
content marketing. They experimented with onboarding, which massively
paid off, and started to understand their own product philosophy. The
developer learned that, once their product became sustainable, they
only had to focus on quality.
