 🎄 TIS THE SEASON TO SHIP FASTER AND HEAD HOME (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Companies like DROPBOX, NOTION AND WIZ have found a new testing
paradigm - and they can't imagine working without it.

Built by ex-Palantir engineers [5], the core doesn't rely on LLMs.
Instead, Meticulous [6] autonomously creates a continuously evolving
suite of E2E UI tests that delivers near-exhaustive coverage with
_zero_ developer effort - impossible to deliver by any other means.

It works in the background like magic:

 	* Near-exhaustive coverage on every test run
 	* No test creation
 	* NO MAINTENANCE (SERIOUSLY) [4]
 	* Zero flakes (built on a deterministic browser)

 LEAK CONFIRMS OPENAI IS PREPARING ADS ON CHATGPT FOR PUBLIC ROLLOUT
(1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI is now internally testing ads inside ChatGPT. The ChatGPT
Android app beta includes new references to an ads feature. The ads
seem to be initially limited to the search experience only. ChatGPT
has roughly 800 million weekly users, so the move has the potential to
disrupt the web economy. 

 “TESLA RIDE” PROGRAM LETS RIDERS EXPERIENCE FSD AND GROK AI IN
REAL-WORLD DEMOS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The new Tesla Ride program brings supervised Full Self-Driving demos
and Grok AI-guided experiences to consumers. Participants will be
allowed to sit in the driver's seat while a Tesla Advisor rides in the
front as co-pilot. The sessions are capped at 45 minutes each, and
participants are required to have a valid driver's license and
insurance. The program will run at some locations until the end of
December.

 DATACENTERS IN SPACE ARE A TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD IDEA (14
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Putting data centers into space is a terrible idea and makes no
sense. The components needed to make a data center work don't work in
space. The reality of making space hardware actually function in space
is not necessarily intuitively obvious. It is possible, but it would
be disproportionately costly compared to Earth-based data centers and
would offer mediocre performance at best. 

 ACHIEVING LASTING REMISSION FOR HIV (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Researchers have discovered a way to keep HIV under control long-term
without constant treatment. Some individuals with long-term HIV
eventually produce antibodies that can neutralize the virus.
Scientists are now racing to find the most potent broadly neutralizing
antibodies and engineer them into a functional cure. Two independent
trials have already shown promise, with some participants maintaining
undetectable levels of HIV for over a year after treatment without
taking antiretrovirals.

 PAY FOR TEST COVERAGE, NOT QA HOURS (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Scaling QA is hard to achieve purely in-house. QA Wolf is the
AI-native service [12] that lets you pay for test coverage, not labor
hours. Their automation-first approach delivers 5x faster tests,
15-minute QA cycles, human-verified bug reports, and 80% coverage in
less than 4 months. See how QA Wolf delivers results [12] 

 HOW GOOD ENGINEERS WRITE BAD CODE AT BIG COMPANIES (10 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 For engineers working on self-contained technical projects, the only
explanation for bad code is incompetence. Other engineers operate more
like plumbers or electricians, working on projects with awkward or
surprising parts that are relatively new to them. In these cases, bad
code is inevitable, but as long as the overall system works well
enough, the project is a success. Engineers don't get to choose the
type of work they end up doing - the mistakes made in an unfamiliar
system are a deliberate tradeoff being made by the company, not the
engineer. 

 AGENTS SHOULD BE MORE OPINIONATED (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The best agent products are the most opinionated. The goal in agent
products is to give users a delightful experience. A good baseline for
agents is that everything works reliably without tweaking too many
settings. Good product design is the result of creators distilling
their vision into an intuitive interface that just works.

sketches to life while retaining the unique art style of the animator.

 HP PLANS TO SAVE MILLIONS BY LAYING OFF THOUSANDS, RAMPING UP AI USE
(3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 HP plans to lay off 4,000 to 6,000 employees in favor of AI
deployments. The company claims the move will help save $1 billion in
annualized gross run rate by the end of its fiscal 2028. The
reductions will affect employees in product development, internal
operations, and customer support. HP hopes that AI will accelerate
product innovation, improve customer satisfaction, and boost
productivity.
