 THIS IS BIG TECH'S PLAYBOOK FOR SWALLOWING THE AI INDUSTRY (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Building leading AI models is extremely costly - raising $400 million
isn't even enough to compete these days. Big Tech has the cash, but it
isn't allowed to buy companies like it once did due to antitrust
enforcement. It has turned to aquihiring - hiring most of a company's
employees and acquiring everything in a company but its name. While
the current antitrust enforcement regime will likely try to block
these types of acquisitions, it may not have a strong legal argument
for doing so.

to launch on August 13, well ahead of the company's usual schedule and
ahead of the launch of the new iPhones expected in September.

 SCIENTISTS CREATE ROBOT CONTROLLED BY BLOB OF HUMAN BRAIN CELLS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chinese researchers have created a robot controlled by a tiny
organoid made from human stem cells. The brain tissue is hooked up to
a neural interface, allowing it to pass instructions to the humanoid
robot body. The setup will allow researchers to study brain-computer
interfaces and help develop techniques for integrating organoids with
the human brain. Organoids could one day be used to repair the human
brain through transplantation. 

 CHINESE SPACE FIRM UNINTENTIONALLY LAUNCHES ITS NEW ROCKET (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Chinese space startup Space Pioneer accidentally launched its
Tianlong-3 rocket during a static fire test. The booster broke free
from the test stand due to a structural failure. It flew several
hundred meters into the sky before crashing explosively into a
mountain 1.5 kilometers away from the test site. The test site is
located about 5 kilometers away from the downtown area of a city with
800,000 people and less than a kilometer from a smaller village. The
company reported that there were no casualties as a result of the
accident.

 JJ INIT (72 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Jujutsu is a new version control system that is on track to replace
Google's existing version control systems. It has an interesting
approach to its design choices in terms of both implementation details

 PROBLEMATIC SECOND (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The leap second was invented to compensate for the difference between
the value measured by atomic clocks and the actual time the Earth
revolves around the Sun. These seconds are usually added on the last
day of June or December. Poor time synchronization can lead to data
loss and other problems. Leap seconds are added rarely, so they
inevitably cause problems almost every time they are added. This
article looks at leap seconds and the various problems they have
caused.

 SUPREME COURT PROTECTS THE FUTURE OF CONTENT MODERATION (11 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 A decision issued by the Supreme Court on Monday explicitly extends
First Amendment protections to how social media platforms organize,
curate, and moderate their feeds. The compilation and curation of
others' speech into an expressive product of its own is entitled to
First Amendment protection. Platforms are making expressive choices
when they use their Standards and Guidelines to decide which content
to display or how the display will be ordered and organized. The
government cannot get its way just by asserting an interest in better
balancing the marketplace of ideas. 

 LIVING IN A LUCID DREAM (24 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article looks at lucid dreaming, the history behind its
research, what the experience is like, how to get into a lucid dream,
and more. More than half of adults will have a lucid dream experience
or one like it at some point in their lives. It is possible to learn
how to lucid dream. The path to learning the skill involves developing
an awareness of the difference between waking and dreaming. This
usually results in small habits that spill into dreams that help
identify whether a person is dreaming.
