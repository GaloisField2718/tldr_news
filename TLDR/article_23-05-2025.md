 WHAT SAM ALTMAN TOLD OPENAI ABOUT THE SECRET DEVICE HE'S MAKING WITH
JONY IVE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI plans to ship 100 million AI 'companions' that will be capable
of being fully aware of users' surroundings and lives. The company
aims to create a third core device for people to use on a desk after a
computer and mobile device. The device will be unobtrusive and be able
to rest in one's pocket or desk. It won't be a phone - one of the
design goals is to help wean users from screens. 

 ANTHROPIC LAUNCHES CLAUDE 4, ITS MOST POWERFUL AI MODEL YET (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has launched Claude 4, a new group of artificial
intelligence models. The company claims that Claude Opus 4 and Claude
Sonnet 4 define a new standard when it comes to AI agents. The models
can analyze thousands of data sources, execute long-running tasks,
write human-quality content, and perform complex actions. Both models
can search the web to complete tasks and alternate between reasoning
and tool use.

 EXCLUSIVE LOOK AT THE CREATION OF HIGH NA, ASML'S NEW $400 MILLION
CHIPMAKING COLOSSUS (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 High NA, which stands for high numerical aperture, is the world's
most advanced and expensive chipmaking machine. Costing more than $400
million, the machine took ASML nearly a decade to develop. It is made
up of four modules that are manufactured around the world and
assembled in the Netherlands. Only five of the colossal machines have
ever been shipped. This article takes a look at High NA, how ASML
plans to deploy the technology, the benefits that High NA provides,
how the technology works, the effects that China, tariffs, and US
growth will have on the technology, and more. A link to a video
showing High NA in action is available at the end of the article. 

 WORLD'S TALLEST 3D-PRINTED BUILDING REACHES A HEIGHT OF 100 FEET (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Tor Alva, the world's tallest 3D-printed building, has been
completed in Switzerland. The structure, which the creators liken to
an 'ornate layered cake', sits at an impressive height of 30 meters.
It is located in a village that's currently home to just 11 people.
The building took around 900 hours of printing to complete using two
construction robots: a 3D printer and a machine used to add steel
reinforcement. Pictures of Tor Alva are available in the article.

 NEW CAPABILITIES FOR BUILDING AGENTS ON THE ANTHROPIC API (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Anthropic has announced four new capabilities on its API that enable
developers to build more powerful AI agents. The code execution tool,
MCP connector, Files API, and ability to cache prompts for up to an
hour will enable developers to build agents that execute code for
advanced data analysis, connect to external systems through MCP
servers, store and access files efficiently across sessions, and
maintain context for up to 60 minutes without building custom
infrastructure. All of the features are now available in public beta
on the Anthropic API. 

 ON 1,145 PULL REQUESTS PER DAY (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Stripe did an average of 1,145 pull requests per day in 2024 while
having less than a minute of API unreliability for the entire year.
The company is likely in the top 1% in software delivery performance.
It has a very demanding but advanced engineering culture with a
relentless focus on continuously shipping value for users. Shipping
safely at this velocity and scale implies heavy investment in
automated tests, deployments, rollbacks, observability, code
ownership, and other areas.

 ENGINEERS AND AI: RAMBLINGS OF A SMALL STARTUP FOUNDER (9 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 While everyone seems to want to replace software engineers, AI just
isn't there yet. Not everyone can just dive into a problem with little
context and get started - it takes time to understand the problem and
ask relevant questions to determine requirements. There is value in
being able to say 'I don't know how to do this', but this is less and
less likely to happen now that people are falling back to AI for
answers when all else fails. People learn by doing something hard -
struggle is part of improvement. 

 META IS ABOUT TO START RATING MORE WORKERS AS 'BELOW EXPECTATIONS,'
