 THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES PREVENTING GENAI ADOPTION IN DEV TEAMS — AND
HOW TO OVERCOME THEM (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Despite significant investments in GenAI tooling, many engineering
leaders still struggle to see the expected return on investment as
developer adoption lags behind.

Join this live discussion [4] with DX's CEO Abi Noda and CTO Laura
Tacho to learn about the organizational and technical barriers
preventing widespread GenAI adoption and practical strategies to
overcome them.

On the agenda:

 	* The most common obstacles to AI adoption, based on learnings from
500+ companies
 	* How to identify specific blockers in your own engineering
organization, and what to do about them
 	* How to guide engineers to leverage AI for day-to-day development
work

 CARPLAY ULTRA'S FIRST TRIAL REVEALS A DEEPLY INTEGRATED, APPLE-LIKE
EXPERIENCE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's CarPlay Ultra is now available. Shipping initially in the
Aston Martin, the next-generation interface expands the iPhone-based
interface across multiple displays on the dashboard. It is able to
display elements such as speed and fuel level. The new CarPlay Ultra
requires an iPhone 12 or later running on iOS 18.4 or newer. A video
that examines the new features of CarPlay Ultra is available in the
article. 

 COINBASE SAYS HACKERS BRIBED STAFF TO STEAL CUSTOMER DATA AND ARE
DEMANDING $20 MILLION RANSOM (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Coinbase customer data was recently stolen by cybercriminals using
social engineering techniques. The incident may cost the company up to
$400 million to fix. The data stolen includes names, addresses, phone
numbers, emails, masked bank account numbers and identifiers, the last
four digits of Social Security numbers, government ID images, and
account balances. The attackers demanded a $20 million ransom, but
Coinbase said it would not pay. It instead offered a $20 million
reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
the criminals responsible for the attack.

 A GENE-EDITING BREAKTHROUGH SAVES INFANT WITH RARE DISEASE (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 An infant in Philadelphia has been successfully treated with a
customized CRISPR gene-editing therapy for a rare and deadly disease.
The infant lacked an enzyme in his liver that normally converts
ammonia to urea. This caused ammonia to build up and damage organs in
the body. Before the treatment, the infant was in the eighth or ninth
percentile for weight - after, he is now in the 35th to 40th
percentile. The infant still needs medication, but now needs less. His
treatment could potentially be used as a template for creating
individualized treatments quickly for other patients with rare
diseases. 

 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE US, A ROTATING DETONATION ROCKET ENGINE
TAKES FLIGHT (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Venus Aerospace has completed a short flight test of its rotating
detonation rocket engine. The concept has been discussed academically
for decades and has previously been tested in a handful of countries,
but this is believed to be the first US-based flight test of the idea.
The technology makes traversing the globe in under two hours possible.
Venus still has a long way to go before it can provide highly
efficient hypersonic commercial flight, but the flight test proves
that such a future is at least possible.

 WORKING ON COMPLEX SYSTEMS (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Understanding the difference between complicated and complex problems
is important because each requires a fundamentally different approach.
Complicated problems are intricate but predictable, following
structured, repeatable solutions, while complex problems are unique,
requiring adaptive and often novel solutions. Recognizing whether a
system is complicated or complex can help lead to solutions with more
effective results. In many environments, systems are neither purely
complicated nor purely complex - the key is learning to recognize when
adaptability is needed and when structural solutions are enough. 

 A YEAR ON, VALKEY CHARTS PATH TO V9 AFTER BREAK FROM REDIS (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Redis' decision to tighten license terms resulted in an exodus of
contributors and the creation of Valkey. Valkey's creation resulted in
a large number of pent-up requests for functionality being unleashed,
some of which were being held up by Redis Open Source. The Valkey team
will likely release v9 rather than 8.2 due to some changes that are a
little bit more intrusive. It plans to be very conservative about what
it puts into a version so that there are as few breaking changes as
possible.

 META IS DELAYING THE ROLLOUT OF ITS FLAGSHIP AI MODEL (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Meta's engineers are struggling to significantly improve the
capabilities of the company's 'Behemoth' large language model. The
model was intentionally slated for an April release, but this has now
been delayed to fall or later. Staff are concerned that the model's
performance won't match public statements about its capabilities. The
company is contemplating significant management changes to its AI
product group. 

 MICROSOFT'S CEO ON HOW AI WILL REMAKE EVERY COMPANY, INCLUDING HIS
(33 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI is rapidly commoditizing, and this is a good thing for Microsoft.
CEO Satya Nadella believes that as AI becomes more accessible and its
usage becomes more efficient, consumption will increase. The company
has created its own AI architectures to prepare for this future.
Microsoft's investment into AI projects will likely generate trillions
of dollars in economic activity.
