 MCP REGISTRY SOLVES DISCOVERY. WORKOS CONNECT SOLVES SECURITY.
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 The MCP Registry makes it easy for LLMs to discover tools, but
discovery alone isn't enough.

Tools still need to act on behalf of users, and that requires secure,
delegated access. API keys don't cut it. They're hard to scope, break
user flows, and undermine the promise of seamless integration.

WorkOS Connect [5] delivers a fully compliant OAuth 2.1 flow. It
handles PKCE, scopes, user consent, and secure token issuance out of
the box.

The WorkOS advantage: 
- Compliant with MCP OAuth 2.1 
- Handles redirects, consent, and scopes 
- Easy to drop in and fast to ship

Ship MCP Auth the right way with WorkOS Connect. [4]

 TRUMP EXPECTED TO SIGN A TIKTOK DEAL THURSDAY (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 President Donald Trump is expected to sign a deal today to facilitate
the sale of TikTok from ByteDance to a group of American investors.
ByteDance will hold less than 20% of the stock in the new company.
Data from users will be stored in the US and overseen by cloud
computing company Oracle. Oracle's co-founder Larry Ellison, CEO of
Dell Technologies Michael Dell, and the Murdoch family will play a
role in the deal. 

 GOOGLE AND QUALCOMM EXECS CONFIRM ANDROID FOR PC IS COMING: 'I'VE
SEEN IT, IT IS INCREDIBLE' (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google wants to bring all of its Android AI features and apps to the
PC ecosystem. It appears that Android laptops will soon be a reality.
Google had confirmed plans to merge ChromeOS and Android into one
thing earlier this year. A recent on-stage conversation between
Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google's head of platforms and devices
Rick Osterloh at a Qualcomm event (video available in the article)
further expanded on those plans.

 NASA CONFIRMS FIRST CREWED MISSION TO ORBIT THE MOON IN 50+ YEARS SET
FOR 2026 (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 NASA is on track to send astronauts to orbit the Moon in early 2026,
its first mission to do so in more than half a century. The manned
mission, dubbed Artemis 2, has experienced multiple setbacks but is
now scheduled for April 2026 at the latest. The crew will comprise
three US and one Canadian astronaut. A video that introduces the
Artemis 2 crew is available in the article. 

 HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED FOR FIRST TIME (9 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Doctors have treated Huntington's disease successfully for the first
time. A genetic disease, Huntington's relentlessly kills brain cells.
It resembles a combination of dementia, Parkinson's, and motor neuron
disease. The new treatment is a type of gene therapy given during 12
to 19 hours of delicate brain surgery. It will likely be very
expensive, but it is considered safe. The data shows that, three years
after surgery, there was an average 75% slowing of the disease.

 HIRING ONLY SENIOR ENGINEERS IS KILLING COMPANIES (9 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 There is currently a huge pool of exceptional junior engineers that
most companies won't even consider. Smart companies can get a
significant advantage by not fighting over seniors and hiring these
juniors instead. Shopify recently hired 25 interns and is aiming for
1,000 more by the end of the year because interns bring energy, drive,
and intensity, which pushes the whole team forward. While it is safer
to hire someone with years of experience who can contribute from day
one, the most critical factors - motivation, ambition, character, and
brains - have little to do with experience. 

 HOW AWS S3 SERVES 1 PETABYTE PER SECOND ON TOP OF SLOW HDDS (14
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AWS S3 is a scalable multi-tenant storage service with APIs to store
and retrieve objects. It offers extremely high availability and
durability at a relatively low cost. What started as a service
optimized for backups and media storage for e-commerce websites has
grown into the main storage system used for analytics and machine
learning on massive data lakes. The growing trend now for entire data
infrastructure projects to be based on S3, which gives them the
benefit of stateless nodes while outsourcing difficult durability,
replication, and load-balancing problems to S3 - this reduces cloud
costs.

 YOU ARE NOT LATE (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 While it would've been amazing to be an entrepreneur during the
dot-com boom, right now is the best time to start something on the
internet. There has never been a time to invent something. People in
the future will look back at right now and think it was a great period
to start, just as we look back to the past and think they had it
great, too. Today is truly a wide-open frontier. 

 SOME LOOSELY ORGANIZED THOUGHTS ON THE CURRENT ZEITGEIST - TERENCE
TAO (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The systems, incentives, and technologies in the modern world have
managed to slightly empower the individual while massively empowering
large organizations, at the significant expense of small
organizations. The imbalanced system provides significant material
comforts and some limited feeling of agency, but it has led to
individuals feeling disconnected, alienated, lonely, and cynical or
pessimistic about the ability to influence future events or meet major
challenges. Much of the current debate on societal issues is framed as
conflicts between large organizations, conflicts between large
organizations and average individuals, or a yearning for a return to a
more traditional era.
