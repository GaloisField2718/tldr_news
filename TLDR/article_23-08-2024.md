 APPLE IS STILL STANDING IN THE WAY OF EPIC'S APP STORE (6 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Epic launched its iOS store in the EU last week thanks to new
regulations opening up the platform. It's not clear whether Epic will
be able to grow the store far beyond its own games. While Epic's game
store may offer better terms for developers, every developer is still
subject to fees from Apple. Epic is in active discussions with almost
every one of the top 250 mobile developers about putting their apps on
the Epic Games Store for mobile, but almost all of them have said they
can't make it work on iOS.

 SPACEX'S POLARIS DAWN IS SENDING ASTRONAUTS TO A LITERAL RADIATION
BELT TO TEST NEW SPACESUITS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Polaris Dawn, a collaboration between SpaceX and Shift4 CEO Jared
Isaacman, will launch on Monday. The mission will send four astronauts
in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on an orbit that will carry them
through the innermost of the Van Allen belts, the bands of high-energy
radiation that surround our planet. Two of the crew members will
complete a spacewalk midway through the 5-day mission. The mission
will be the first flight test of SpaceX's new pressure suits for
extravehicular activities. 

 A NEWLY APPROVED ‚ÄòLIVING DRUG' COULD SAVE MORE CANCER PATIENTS'
LIVES (19 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Iovance Biotherapeutics has developed a 'living drug' made up of
immune cells from patients' own tumors. The therapy involves taking
the immune cells from the patient's tumor, growing them in the lab,
and then infusing them back into the body. The massive influx of
immune cells zeros in on and attacks cancer cells, and in some cases,
appears to wipe out every last one. The drug doesn't work for
everyone, but it can still be a lifesaver for some patients. It has
been approved in the US for advanced melanoma.

 CONTINUOUS REINVENTION: A BRIEF HISTORY OF BLOCK STORAGE AT AWS (27
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post provides a history of Elastic Block Store, one of AWS's
foundational services. It covers queuing theory, the importance of
comprehensive instrumentation, and the value of incrementalism versus
radical changes. EBS's development team's approach, which was to make
a series of incremental improvements over time, allowed them to
develop customer value sooner and course correct as they learned more
about changing customer workloads. They were able to make significant
improvements to the service without taking it online.

 THE SILICON VALLEY CANON: ON THE PAIDE√çA OF THE AMERICAN TECH ELITE
(16 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Most Silicon Valley types make time to read books, book reviews, or
listen to podcasts about books enough to fool others into thinking
they have read a book. Books have an inordinate impact on the Silicon
Valley mindspace. These books often have no obvious connection to
software. They form a sort of vague tech canon. This article presents
the list of books that form the Silicon Valley canon. These books
cover the major ideas that are influential in tech.
