viewer data on more than 18,000 titles representing a total of nearly

synapses to emulate the brain's ability to learn, adapt, and process
information in a highly parallel and distributed manner. The
neuromorphic supercomputer will be capable of 228 trillion synaptic

 COSMIC NUCLEAR FISSION SEEN FOR 1ST TIME IN 'INCREDIBLY PROFOUND'
DISCOVERY (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Scientists have discovered the first indication of nuclear fission
occurring amongst the stars. The discovery supports the idea that
neutron stars create superheavy elements that break down via nuclear
fission to birth elements like gold. It brings scientists a step
closer to solving the mystery of where the universe's heavy elements
come from. The research also indicated that elements with atomic
masses greater than 260 may briefly exist around neutron star smashes.

 WHY THE AI ACT WAS SO HARD TO PASS (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 European lawmakers have reached a provisional deal on artificial
intelligence rules. The EU AI Act uses a tier system that ranks AI
applications based on risk. High risk AI systems, systems that could
impact safety or fundamental rights, and General Purpose AI Systems,
have the most onerous regulatory restrictions. Many parts of the
legislation were heavily contested even until the final hours before
the deal was approved. The full approved AI Act text won't be
available for several weeks.
