 😘 KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. But getting that kind of coverage—and staying there—is
hard and pricey for any size team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native service SUPPORTS WEB AND MOBILE APPS,
delivering 80% automated test coverage in weeks [6] and helping teams
SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles to minutes.

With QA Wolf, you get:

✅ Unlimited parallel test runs

✅ 15-min QA cycles

✅ 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation

✅ Zero-flake guarantee

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] saw 4x more test cases
and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 APPLE TO ANALYZE USER DATA ON DEVICES TO BOLSTER AI TECHNOLOGY (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple will start training artificial intelligence models by analyzing
data on customers' devices to improve its AI platform. The company
currently trains its models using synthetic data, but synthetic
information isn't always representative of actual customer data.
Customer data will remain on-device and won't be directly used to
train AI models. The new system will roll out in an upcoming beta of
iOS and iPadOS 18.5 and macOS 15.5. 

 META FIGHTS TO KEEP INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP, AS ANTITRUST TRIAL BEGINS
(6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The FTC's antitrust case against Meta seeks to compel the company to
undo its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta allegedly wields
an illegal monopoly in social media. The company says that the FTC's
case ignores how people use technology today - Meta currently faces
stiff competition from YouTube, TikTok, and other video platforms. It
plans to demonstrate that competition is alive and well in the social
networking industry.

 GOOGLE IS TALKING TO DOLPHINS USING PIXEL PHONES AND AI - AND THE
VIDEO IS DELIGHTFUL (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A new AI model from Google running on Pixel phones is helping
researchers better understand the language of dolphins. DolphinGemma
was created using dolphin language data collected over 40 years. It
was built specifically for Pixel devices. Google plans to share
DolphinGemma as an open model this summer. The research may eventually
enable us to construct sounds that dolphins might understand. 

 SCIENTISTS REVIVE ORGANISM FOUND BURIED AT BOTTOM OF OCEAN (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 German researchers have revived algae cells that were dormant for
over 7,000 years. Found buried at the bottom of the Baltic Sea
imprisoned under layers of sediment, the cells were deprived of oxygen
or light for millennia. They showed full function recovery after being
revived and started multiplying again with no issues. It is now
possible to conduct 'time-jump experiments' into the various stages of
Baltic Sea development in the lab.

 GH-SIGNOFF (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 gh-signoff is a GitHub command-line extension for local CI. It
enables developers to run CI on their own machines and sign off when
they pass. Developer machines are super-fast nowadays and chronically
underutilized - Cloud CI services are typically slow, expensive, and
rented. gh-signoff brings CI back in-house. 

 THE POST-DEVELOPER ERA (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The job market is currently having a tough time, but this isn't
because companies are actually replacing developers with autonomous AI
agents. There are macroeconomic factors, layoffs, and other things
leaving tons of highly qualified devs out there looking for work. Some
companies are operating under the myth that AI will make developers
obsolete soon so they're not hiring as aggressively as they otherwise
would. However, despite AI evangelists claiming that, any day now,
companies won't need human developers to build their products, human
developers are still needed.

 RIPPLING IS TRYING TO SERVE DEEL'S CEO, BUT BAILIFFS CAN'T FIND HIM
(1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 French bailiffs hired by Rippling were unable to locate Deel's CEO,
Alex Bouaziz, during attempts to serve him with papers as part of a
lawsuit alleging Deep paid one of its employees to spy on Rippling.
Bouaziz is known to be 'highly nomadic' but remains very attached to
France, where he has a listed address. Rippling may need to apply to
serve him via email. 

 OPENAI'S NEW GPT-4.1 AI MODELS FOCUS ON CODING (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI has launched a new family of models called GPT-4.1 that excels
at coding and instruction-following. The models, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1
mini, and GPT-4.1 nano, are available through OpenAI's API but not
ChatGPT. They are multimodal and have a 1-million-token context
window. GPT-4.1 costs $2 per million input tokens and $8 per million
output tokens, GPT-4.1 mini is $0.40/million input tokens and
$1.60/million output tokens, and GPT-4.1 nano is $0.10/million input
tokens and $0.40/million output tokens.

 SOME LOVE FOR INTEROPERABLE APPS (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Interoperable apps enable users to easily explore different

 ACCESS TO FUTURE AI MODELS IN OPENAI'S API MAY REQUIRE A VERIFIED ID

verification.
