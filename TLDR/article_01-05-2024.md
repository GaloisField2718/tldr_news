 APPLE TO UNVEIL AI-ENABLED SAFARI BROWSER ALONGSIDE NEW OPERATING
SYSTEMS (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is testing a version of its Safari web browser that includes an
AI-powered tool called Intelligent Search. Intelligent Search
leverages Apple's on-device AI technology to identify topics and key
phrases within a web page to create summaries. The exact
implementation of the feature is still unknown. The new Safari will
also have a feature called Web Eraser that will allow users to remove
specific portions of web pages. Apple is working on a powerful visual
search feature that will allow users to obtain information on consumer
products when browsing through images, scheduled for integration
sometime in 2025. 

 TESLA TO LAY OFF EVERYONE WORKING ON SUPERCHARGERS, NEW VEHICLES (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla is laying off its director of EV charging Rebecca Tinucci, the
head of new vehicle development Daniel Ho, as well as the teams that
operated under the two executives. These layoffs are part of a larger
effort by CEO Elon Musk to reduce costs and headcount within the
company. Tesla plans to continue building out some new Supercharger
locations and finish those currently under construction. Musk is also
dissolving the company's public policy team in this latest cull.

 ENZYMES OPEN NEW PATH TO UNIVERSAL DONOR BLOOD (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have discovered enzymes that are able to remove specific
sugars that make up the A and B antigens in the human ABO blood groups
when mixed with medicine blood cells. The researchers are close to
being able to produce universal blood from group B donors, but there
is still more work to be done to convert the more complex group A
blood type. There is now a higher need for donor blood due to a larger
proportion of the population being elderly and more patients
undergoing blood-intensive medical procedures. Successfully converting
A or B blood types into universal donor blood would markedly reduce
the logistics and costs currently associated with storing four
different blood types and increase the supply of donor blood by
reducing waste. 

 PORTAL SPACE SYSTEMS UNVEILS SUPERNOVA, AN ULTRA-MOBILE SPACECRAFT (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Portal Space Systems' ultra-mobile Supernova satellite bus could
propel transfers from low Earth orbit to geostationary orbit in a
matter of hours. The 500 kg vehicle is designed to be payload agnostic
and survive in orbit for at least five years while being continuously
maneuvered. It uses a solar-thermal propulsion system that produces a
delta-V of 6 kilometers per second. Portal aims to conduct an
in-flight demonstration in late 2025 or early 2026. It is looking to
scale up its team and grow manufacturing to support the production of
multiple spacecraft per year.

 THE BORGO PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Borgo is a statically typed language that compiles to Go. It is more
expressive than Go but less complex than Rust. Borgo's syntax is
similar to Rust but with optional semicolons. It is fully compatible
with existing Go packages. An online playground that provides a tour
of the language is available. 

 "RUN0" AS A SUDO REPLACEMENT (30 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 run0 is a sudo replacement that will be part of the upcoming systemd
256 release. It avoids the use of setuid permissions entirely. Using
setuid permissions results in an execution context for privileged code
that is half under the control of unprivileged code and needs careful
manual cleanup. This page contains the Mastodon stream that discusses
replacing sudo with run0.

 APPLE POACHES AI EXPERTS FROM GOOGLE, CREATES SECRETIVE EUROPEAN AI
LAB (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple's top AI team is made up of former key figures from Google. The
company has bought about two dozen AI startups in the past decade.
Apple is focusing on bringing on-device AI capabilities to the iPhone.
The next iPhone could feature a voice-activated smart personal
assistant that interacts with apps. More details about these AI
features will likely be announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers
Conference in June. 

 üá™üá∫ DEAR EUROPE, PLEASE WAKE UP ‚Äì EU/ACC (13 MINUTE READ) [13]


 The lack of startups in Europe isn't due to taxes or mentality, it's
because of friction. Startups need early acceleration to become
successful - more friction will mean competitors have a better chance
of winning. The EU needs a system similar to the US where Delaware is
the de facto standard for legal entities for startups - there are
currently too many legal systems to navigate. It also needs to take
teaching English seriously as a lack of English ability limits
communication and job opportunities.
