 THE MAN TASKED WITH REBOOTING AMAZON AI (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Rohit Prasad, one of the chief architects of Amazon's Alexa, is
leading the company's effort to catch up in the AI race. Prasad is
leading a new team of thousands of people to develop AI products for
an Alexa upgrade and other businesses. Amazon is expected to unveil a
new Alexa with AI as early as next month, but company insiders say
Amazon's proprietary models are still behind those of its biggest
competitors. Amazon prefers to develop its own technology to have full
control over its products and services, but it has increasingly leaned
on partnerships as the AI race has progressed. 

 HOW SONOS BOTCHED AN APP AND INFURIATED ITS CUSTOMERS (7 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Sonos' app launch in May was one of the most disastrous software
releases by any consumer technology company ever. The app was released
with plenty of bugs and missing core functionality. Sonos predicts
that it will fall $200 million short of its annual revenue target. It
has postponed two new products until the problems are fixed, which is
still expected to take months. The issues were caused by the company
ignoring tech debt, disregarding employee warnings, and cutting costs.

 THE INTELLIGENCE AGE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 People have become dramatically more capable over time - this trend
is not new, but it will soon be accelerated. We are now more capable
than our ancestors because we benefit from the infrastructure of
society. Our ancestors contributed to the scaffolding of human
progress. AI will give people tools to solve hard problems and help
them add new scaffolding. Progress will continue - our children will
be able to do things we can't. 

 SPACEX PLANS 5 UNCREWED STARSHIP MISSIONS TO MARS BY 2026, CREWED BY

 SpaceX plans to launch five uncrewed missions to Mars in two years,
which is when the next Earth-Mars transfer window opens. The success
of the flights will determine the timeline for human-boarded flights
to Mars, which could be as early as 2028. SpaceX is still waiting for
FAA approval for Starship's fifth test flight. It is expected to be
issued in late November.

 CLOUDFLARE'S NEW MARKETPLACE WILL LET WEBSITES CHARGE AI BOTS FOR
SCRAPING (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Cloudflare plans to launch a marketplace in the next year that will
allow website owners to sell access to AI model providers to scrape
their site's content. It is part of the company's plan to give
publishers greater control over how and when AI bots scrape their
websites. The company launched free observability tools for customers
on Monday as part of this plan, giving website owners a dashboard to
view analytics on why, when, and how often AI models are crawling
their sites for information. It is also letting customers block AI
bots from their sites with a click of a button. 

 SWAPY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Swapy is a simple JavaScript tool that converts any layout into a
drag-to-swap one with just a few lines of code. It is framework
agnostic and there are examples in the repository for how to use it
with React, Vue, and Svelte. Swapy can listen to swap events and
layouts can be as complex as users desire. An interactive example is
available on the website linked in the repository.

 FOUNDER MODE VS BUREAUCRAT MODE (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Bureaucrat mode is what happens when companies get big, scaled, and
successful. People purposely implement best practices with good
intentions, but these processes can make it hard to get anything done.
Startups have a huge advantage over large companies in that they can
move incredibly fast and just focus on output. As startups start to
gain success and get bigger, they start to get bogged down with
bureaucracy. This allows for newer, more nimble startups to emerge -
then the cycle continues. 

 ANIME IS EATING THE WORLD (22 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Anime has become a multi-billion dollar industry. It is driving pop
culture today. The estimated total market size, accounting for anime,
comics, and games, is estimated to be more than $50 billion. Anime is
where the future of creation and play is happening and it will likely
become one of the dominant formats through which we consume and engage
with content.

water.
