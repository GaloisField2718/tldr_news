 [RESEARCH BY ECONOMIST IMPACT] GAIN AN AGENTIC AI EDGE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI agents will soon be mainstream. But unlocking their full potential
requires more than tech alone — it demands strategic implementation
that fuses traditional analytics and machine learning with agentic
capabilities [4], along with enterprise-wide deployment and robust
governance.

With expert insights and independent research, unlock the blueprint
[4] to agentic AI. Get insights from Economist Impact to supercharge

 GOOGLE'S GEMINI AI FAMILY UPDATED WITH STABLE 2.5 PRO,
SUPER-EFFICIENT 2.5 FLASH-LITE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google has expanded its Gemini AI model family. Gemini 2.5 Pro has
left preview and Gemini 2.5 Pro Flash-Lite is now in preview. Gemini
2.5 Flash-Lite can run high-volume AI workloads without incurring
significant costs. Google Flash and Flash-Lite are coming to search -
custom versions of these models are now active in AI overviews and AI
Mode. The Flash-Lite preview is available in Google AI Studio and
Vertex AI for developers. 

 MUSK'S XAI BURNS THROUGH $1 BILLION A MONTH AS COSTS PILE UP (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 xAI is trying to raise $9.3 billion in debt and equity, with plans to
spend more than half of it in just the next three months. The startup
is expected to burn through about $13 billion over the course of 2025.
Its prolific fundraising efforts are just barely keeping pace with
expenses. The losses are due in part to the huge costs that all AI
companies face - building server farms and buying the specialized
computer chips needed to train advanced AI models.

 HONDA UNEXPECTEDLY ENTERS THE SPACE RACE WITH FIRST SUCCESSFUL ROCKET
LAUNCH (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Honda recently launched and landed a prototype reusable rocket. The
company plans to achieve suborbital space flight by 2029. The
20.6-foot experimental reusable launch vehicle reached an altitude of
889 feet at a test facility in northern Japan. Honda has yet to make a
decision regarding the commercialization of its rocket technologies.
The launch and landing's success sets an optimistic tone for the
company's space program. 

 MICROBE WITH BIZARRELY TINY GENOME MAY BE EVOLVING INTO A VIRUS (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A newly discovered microbe known as Sukunaarchaeum isn't a virus, but
it seemingly has just one purpose: to make more of itself. It appears
to be a parasite that provides nothing to its hosts. Most of its genes
are focused on replicating its own genome and it steals everything it
needs from its host. The microbe's bizarre virus-like way of living
challenges the boundaries between cellular life and viruses.

 REDIS 8.0 (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Redis 8.0 introduces powerful new capabilities and over 30
performance improvements. The Redis Community Edition has been renamed
to Redis Open Source - this version offers the full power of Redis.
This post looks at the new features, improvements, and changes with
the update. There are some breaking changes regarding ACL behavior and
the Redis Query Engine. 

 DOUBLE-ENTRY LEDGERS: THE MISSING PRIMITIVE IN MODERN SOFTWARE (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Double-entry ledger modeling is a better fit for a lot of systems
compared to the ad-hoc ledger-ish things they currently use. A
double-entry ledger records the current amount or balance of a thing,
a historical record of how the amount got to that amount, and where
that amount came from at each step. Apps with ledger models built-in
can have many things built on top of them without a lot of extra work
or complexity. While there is an initial cost to introducing a ledger,
that value is recouped over time.

 SAM ALTMAN SAYS META TRIED AND FAILED TO POACH OPENAI'S TALENT WITH
$100M OFFERS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Meta seems to be on a hiring spree lately to staff up its new
superintelligence team. It has reportedly offered employees from
OpenAI and Google DeepMind compensation packages worth upwards of $100
million. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that those efforts have largely
been unsuccessful. Altman believes that Meta's focus on high
compensation rather than a mission of delivering AGI would likely not
create a great culture. 

 AMAZON CEO SAYS AI AGENTS WILL SOON REDUCE COMPANY'S CORPORATE
WORKFORCE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy issued a memo to employees on Tuesday saying
that he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in the
next few years as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help
fulfill workplace duties. Generative AI and agents are expected to
change the way the company does its work. Amazon will need fewer
people doing the same jobs done today, and more people doing other
types of jobs. The hard pivot into AI has received negative feedback
from some white-collar employees at the company.
