 THERMONUCLEAR BLASTS AND NEW SPECIES: INSIDE ELON MUSK'S PLAN TO
COLONIZE MARS (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX employees are working on the design and details of a Martian
city. Teams are working on habitats and spacesuits to combat the
planet's hostile environment. The initiatives are still in their
infancy. Elon Musk told SpaceX employees in April that he expects one
million people to be living on Mars in about 20 years. Musk's vision
for Mars underlies most of the six companies that he leads or owns -
each could potentially contribute to an extraterrestrial colony. 

 OPENAI DEFINES FIVE 'LEVELS' FOR AI TO REACH HUMAN INTELLIGENCE ‚Äî
IT'S ALMOST AT LEVEL 2 (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI recently shared a five-level system for tracking its
artificial general intelligence progress. The levels go from what is
currently available to AI that can perform the same amount of work as
an organization. They may change based on feedback from employees,
investors, and the company's board. OpenAI executives believe the
company's AI is currently on the first level, but it is getting close
to level two, where AI can perform basic problem-solving.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 INSIDE THE LABORATORY FOR EXTRAORDINARY MICROBES (16 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Humanity has discovered an estimated 0.001 percent of all microbes.
Most scientists work with E. coli, which is easy to handle and
experiment with in the lab. The Cultivarium is a non-profit that aims
to democratize access to extraordinary microbes as it believes that
the next biological breakthrough will come from these overlooked
microbes. It will build tools to grow, transform, and engineer
microbes such as the salt lovers, heat tolerators, and geyser growers
that have long been inaccessible to scientists. 

 SCIENTISTS DISCOVER A NEW HORMONE THAT CAN BUILD STRONG BONES (6
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Davis recently discovered that
Maternal Brain Hormone (CCN3) increases bone density and strength in
mice. The hormone's effects explain how women's bones remain
relatively robust even as calcium is stripped from their bones to
support milk production. Mice with increased CCN3 had dramatic
increases in bone mass and strength over the course of weeks,
regardless of age and sex. The hormone can be administered through a
hydrogel patch applied directly to the site of a bone fracture.

 AWS SECRETS MANAGER AGENT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 The AWS Secrets Manager Agent is a client-side HTTP service that
standardizes the consumption of secrets for the Secrets Manager across
Amazon environments. It can retrieve and cache secrets in memory so
applications can fetch secrets from localhost instead of making calls
to the Secrets Manager. The agent can only make read requests and
can't modify secrets. 

 MANDALA (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 mandala eliminates the effort and code overhead of ML experiment
tracking by allowing researchers to automatically save, query, and
version Python computations. It can capture the inputs, outputs, and
code of Python functions, automatically organize executions of
imperative code into a high-level computation graph of variables and
operations, query relationships between variables, and automate
exploration and high-level operations. Tutorials are available.

 UNIQUE NEW VESTING SCHEDULES (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Companies traditionally use a 4-year vesting schedule where employees
get 25% of their total equity grant every year for 4 years as long as
they're with the company. More companies have started experimenting
with unique vesting schedules to attract more talent while also saving
money. This article highlights a few of these companies and their
vesting schedules. Many of the grants typically net lower than they
used to. 

 THE AFTERMATH OF THE SUPREME COURT'S NETCHOICE RULING (13 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 The NetChoice decision by the Supreme Court last week is poised to
affect a host of tech legislation still being developed as well as
current lawsuits, including the pending First Amendment challenge to
the TikTok 'ban' bill. The decision states that tech platforms can
exercise their First Amendment rights through their content moderation
decisions and how they choose to display content on their services. It
has clear ramifications for laws that attempt to regulate platform
algorithms. This article looks at how the decision will influence
legislation and its impact on current lawsuits.
