 SCIENTISTS SAY THEY'VE FIGURED OUT HOW TO REGENERATE KNEE CARTILAGE
(2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Scientists at Northwestern University have invented a goo that could
open the door to regenerating human knee cartilage. The goo mimics the
chemical structure of cartilage. Animal subjects who had their joints
treated with the biomaterial grew new cartilage within six months. If
the goo works in humans, it could benefit people who need knee
replacement surgeries, athletes who experience ACL tears, and people
who suffer from degenerative diseases like arthritis.

(8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Simon Westbrook started a biotech company with his wife Dominique
after they were made redundant by Pfizer in 2011. Their mission was to
develop a game-changing drug to treat osteoarthritis. 14 years after
starting their mission, the effectiveness of their company's treatment
has exceeded all expectations. The treatment, which restores
protective processes to diseased joints and enables the regeneration
of affected tissues, can be delivered via a once-a-month injection.
This article tells the story of how the drug was developed.

 GIL BECOME OPTIONAL IN PYTHON 3.13 (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can be disabled in Python version 3.13.
GIL is a mechanism used by the C Python interpreter to ensure that
only one thread executes the Python bytecode at a time. Free-threaded
mode, which disables GIL, is currently experimental. Disabling GIL
makes a massive difference in the performance of multithreaded tasks. 

 GO IS MY HAMMER, AND EVERYTHING IS A NAIL (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Go can do basically anything. It's simple, easy to read, and
consistent. Using only Go means less context switching and leads to a
deeper understanding of the language. There are basically an infinite
number of projects out there, so there's still plenty to build even if
only knowing one language was a restriction.

 AMERICAN WORKERS ARE STUCK IN PLACE BECAUSE EVERYONE IS TOO AFRAID OF

who want to quit their jobs but are staying put due to a fear of a
potential recession. Americans are quitting their jobs at the slowest
pace since the pandemic, despite job satisfaction falling. Job market
