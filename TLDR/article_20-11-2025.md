TLDR 2025-11-20

 61% OF LEADERS SPEND MORE TIME PROVING SECURITY RATHER THAN IMPROVING
IT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI-driven attacks are getting bigger, faster, and more sophisticated.
But Vanta's newest State of Trust [4] survey of 3,500 leaders shows
that businesses are spending way more time and energy proving trust
than building it:

>> 61% of leaders spend more time proving security rather than
improving it

>> 59% note that AI risks outpace their expertise

>> But 95% say AI is making their security teams more effective

Get the full report [4] to learn how organizations are navigating
these changes, and what early adopters are doing to stay ahead.

 AGING AS A DISEASE: THE RISE OF LONGEVITY SCIENCE (13 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The frontier of medicine is shifting from fighting disease to
pursuing more life. Speakers at the recent Progress Conference 2025
held at Lighthaven spoke about extending life by addressing the
biological hallmarks of aging itself: genomic instability, telomere
shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular senescence. The
new frontier is to find targeted interventions that impact these
factors. The pursuit of longevity, not survival, is still in its early
days. Research is happening largely along non-traditional paths and
with non-traditional funding and support models. 

 NEW NANOPARTICLE MRNA VACCINE MAY BE CHEAPER AND 100 TIMES MORE
POWERFUL (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers at MIT have developed a new lipid nanoparticle that
enhances the effectiveness of an mRNA vaccine by a hundred times
compared to stand-alone effectiveness in mice. The system could be
used to develop vaccines for a number of diseases, including COVID-19
and influenza. By increasing potency and reducing cost per dosage, the
system could become an inexpensive way to combat many infectious
diseases. It could also help improve the efficacy of some vaccines.

 COMPANIES ARE WARMING UP TO SAYING AI IS THE REASON FOR JOB CUTS (8
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI was referenced in roughly a fifth of total job cuts announced in
the US last month. Executives have been touting efficiency gains from
AI as a reason for a shrinking or flat workforce. Even when companies
aren't saying AI helps eliminate jobs, they are mentioning it as a
reason to raise the bar on new hires. There is still some uncertainty
about how useful AI tools are and how to fit them into daily work - if
tech firms can ease that uncertainty, it may open the door to wider
corporate AI adoption. 

 THE FTC'S META ANTITRUST IMPLOSION (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Meta worked to make Instagram and WhatsApp successful by improving
their design and increasing their revenue. The company has been forced
to evolve in response to competition, increasing smartphone usage, and
a massive leap in AI-powered algorithms. To prove that Meta holds a
monopoly would require proving that TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, and X
aren't real competitors. Meta's enormous profits aren't evidence of
monopoly power.
