 META REPORTEDLY EYEING 'SUPER SENSING' TECH FOR SMART GLASSES (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta is working on a 'super sensing' type of facial recognition
technology for its smart glasses lineup. The software will be able to
recognize people by name and keep a better track of what users are
doing throughout the day. It will be opt-in only. The company is
reportedly working on two new pairs of smart glasses and also
re-evaluating its privacy policies and potential safety risks
associated with the technology. 

 OPENAI HIRES INSTACART CEO AS HEAD OF APPLICATIONS (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Instacart CEO Fidji Simo is joining OpenAI to lead its applications
business. Simo has served as an OpenAI board member over the last
year. She will remain CEO of Instacart for the next few months. Simo
will focus on enabling OpenAI's traditional company functions to scale
as it enters its next phase of growth, which will allow CEO Sam Altman
to increase his focus on research, compute, and safety, which are
critical as the company approaches superintelligence.

 AURORA TO ADD NIGHT DRIVING, NEW ROUTES AS IT RAMPS DRIVERLESS
TRUCKING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Aurora Innovation plans to expand its driverless trucking route
beyond Dallas to Houston and into El Paso and Phoenix. The company
plans to start sending its self-driving trucks out at night and during
adverse weather conditions in the second half of 2025. It already runs
freight with self-driving trucks in those conditions, but with a human
safety operator behind the wheel. Running at nighttime would double
the company's drive time and is a key milestone. 

 ULTRA-RARE 'ASIAN UNICORN' HAS GENOME SEQUENCED, AND IT COULD MEAN
EVERYTHING (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The saola is a bovine that hangs out in the mountainous forests of
Vietnam and Laos. The species wasn't scientifically described until
1993 and has still never been seen in person by scientists or studied
in the wild. It is a critically endangered species with an estimated
population ranging from 50 to up to a few hundred individuals. An
international team of scientists has reconstructed the saola genome,
hinting at some potential good news for the chances of its
conservation. The saola are split into two populations with
considerable genetic differences, which means there may be enough
genetic diversity to start working on building a captive breeding
program.

 POSTGRESQL 18 BETA 1 RELEASED! (5 MINUTE READ) [10]

download. It contains previews of all of the features in PostgreSQL
18, but some of the details of the release may change during the beta
period. The update improves performance and the developer experience
and introduces new security features. It also adds monitoring and
observability tools. This post goes over the new update. 

 ASK HN: HOW MUCH BETTER ARE AI IDES VS. COPY PASTING INTO CHAT APPS?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [11] 

 Copying and pasting into chat apps can be tedious, but assistants
like Copilot aren't as smart as the 'thinking' chat apps. This makes
it clear why AI IDEs exist, but using them can get expensive because
of the pay-per-use pricing as opposed to effectively unlimited prompts
for a monthly subscription as with thinking apps. This Hacker News
thread contains a discussion on the current state of AI IDEs and how
they compare to chat apps. The thread mentions lesser known
alternatives to Cursor and Windsurf, such as Roo code and aider-chat,
that unlock different workflows.

 BILL GATES TELLS HIS FOUNDATION TO SPEND IT ALL BY 2045 (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Bill Gates expects his foundation to exhaust its coffers and spend
more than $200 billion over the next 20 years. The total of Gates'
donation is expected to be the second-largest philanthropic gift in US
history, adjusted for inflation. His foundation has already spent more
than $100 billion on a range of causes. Many of the foundation's
beneficiaries have been people in low-income countries with endemic
and frequently deadly diseases. 

 ASK HN: WHAT ARE GOOD HIGH-INFORMATION DENSITY UIS (SCREENSHOTS,
APPS, SITES)? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [13] 

 It can be difficult to find examples of good high information density
UIs. This Hacker News thread lists resources for finding these
examples and tips for how to find good examples. One of these methods
is to look at programs used by pro creatives - some people regularly
spend their days using a single such product as their primary work
tool. Another source of good examples of dense information
communication can be found in command line system monitoring tools.
