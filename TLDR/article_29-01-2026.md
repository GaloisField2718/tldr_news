 🚀 FASTER MOBILE APP RELEASES WITH 100% PARALLEL AUTOMATED QA
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf [5] gets mobile apps to 80% automated test coverage in weeks
[5]. They create and maintain your test suite in Appium (no vendor
lock-in) — and provide unlimited, 100% parallel test runs [5] with
zero flakes.

✅ QA cycles reduced from hours to less than 15 minutes

✅ Tests run on real iOS devices and Android emulators

✅ Flake-free runs, no false positives

✅ Human-verified bug reports

No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No more bugs
reaching production.

 ANDROID'S FULL DESKTOP INTERFACE LEAKS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A bug report on the Chromium Issue Tracker has inadvertently leaked
the Android desktop interface. The bug report, which was about Chrome
Incognito tabs, was accompanied by two screen captures. They show a
taller status bar compared to tablets, a Chrome interface that mostly
aligns with the current large-screen Android version, and mostly
unchanged desktop windowing. The screen captures are available in the
article. 

 TESLA TO INVEST $2 BILLION IN ELON MUSK'S XAI, CANCEL TWO EV MODELS
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tesla entered into an agreement on January 16 to invest in xAI's
Series E funding round. SpaceX also invested $2 billion in xAI. Tesla
will end production for its Model S and Model X higher-end vehicles,
as they have seen sluggish sales compared with other models. The Model
X and S factory space will be used to manufacture Optimus robots.

 RESEARCHERS ARE USING AI TO DECODE THE HUMAN GENOME (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 AlphaGenome is an AI model that can make predictions about thousands
of genes. It was trained on a vast wealth of molecular data, allowing
it to predict things like whether a mutation will shut off a gene or
switch it on at the wrong time. The model is being deployed for use in
things like cancer research, but scientists are still wary of its
results. AlphaGenome is still just a prediction tool, so scientists
still need to go to the lab to verify its output. 

 VIDEO: CHINA'S 18 HUMANOID ROBOTS EMERGE FROM CRATES IN AN EX
MACHINA-LIKE SCENE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 LimX Dynamics has released a video showing 18 of its full-sized
humanoid robots autonomously performing a coordinated routine. The
showcase highlights how teams of robots could be deployed and operate
on future manufacturing floors. LimX's robots run on the company's
newly introduced COSA system, which allows multiple humanoid robots to
function together autonomously. The COSA operating system unifies
perception models, learned skills, memory, and basic emotional states
for sustained physical interaction in real-world settings. The video
is available in the article.

 THE FIVE LEVELS: FROM SPICY AUTOCOMPLETE TO THE DARK FACTORY (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The cost of code is dropping so fast that teams need to reconsider
their tech debt payment plans. Smart teams are deferring payment on
human hours today to pay them back with cheaper AI hours tomorrow.
Cashing in on those cheap hours requires understanding how to move
through the tiers of automation. Luckily, the federal government has
already completed a roadmap for autonomous cars. The five levels of
driving automation are a helpful guide on what companies should aim
for. 

 THE 80% PROBLEM IN AGENTIC CODING (20 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI writing most of the code places a disproportionate emphasis on the
human's role of owning outcomes, maintaining quality bars, and
ensuring that tests actually validate behavior. The danger is that the
AI succeeds so well that developers stop checking their outputs. AI is
an amplifier of development practices. Bad processes will result in
accumulated debt at an unprecedented speed.

 AI ASSISTED INTERVIEWS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 When faced with a problem, strong candidates stay calm, form precise
hypotheses, and then systematically test one hypothesis at a time
until they zero in on a solution. AI just accelerates this process.
Weak candidates blindly try things, hoping something sticks. Their
process remains sloppy when using AI. AI doesn't by default make
people perform better, it amplifies people's existing patterns. 

 AMAZON LAYING OFF ABOUT 16,000 CORPORATE WORKERS IN LATEST
ANTI-BUREAUCRACY PUSH (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Amazon announced yesterday that it plans to eliminate about 16,000
corporate jobs in its second round of job cuts since last October. The
layoffs are part of an ongoing effort to strengthen the organization
by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.
14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce
during October's layoffs. Amazon has been cutting costs across its
businesses so that it can invest more in AI and the rapid build-out of
data centers. It recently closed its Fresh and Go grocery chains after
years of experimentation.
