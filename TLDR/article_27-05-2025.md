 APPLE IS COMING FOR THE SMART HOME — AND FAST (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Apple's rumored Face-ID door lock and smart display are more than
just products.. 

They signal a major push into the $158B smart home market, _growing
23% annually._

As Apple doubles down, investors are hunting for the next breakout
company and acquisition target, following in the footsteps of Google
(acquired Nest, $3.2B) and Amazon (acquired Ring, $1.2B). 

History shows: WHEN APPLE ENTERS, THEY GO BIG.

ONE STARTUP [4] is perfectly positioned to benefit. 

With $12M in revenue, distribution in Bestbuy and HomeDepot, and 10
defensive patents, they are built for a breakout.

SHARES ARE $1.90 UNTIL 05/30. Join 3000+ investors before the price
changes [4].

 APPLE TO UNVEIL 'SOLARIUM' UI OVERHAUL FOR ALL DEVICES AT WWDC (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple plans to introduce a design overhaul for all of its operating
systems at WWDC. The updated interface, codenamed 'Solarium', will
give the operating systems a more slick and modern appearance. It
borrows a lot of elements from visionOS. The UI overhaul will be the
biggest for iPhones since iOS 7 in 2013 and for Macs since macOS Big
Sur in 2020. 

 SPACEX PUSHES TO GET STARSHIP ROCKET READY FOR MARS BY NEXT YEAR (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX has been moving more employees into Starship roles in recent
months. The space company has also been making big investments in its
complex in Texas for the vehicle and has similar plans for Florida. It
is behind schedule on a variant of Starship for a NASA mission to the
moon currently set for 2027. SpaceX has been struggling this year,
with back-to-back Starship flight tests that ended in explosions.

 SHOULD EVERYONE BE TAKING OZEMPIC? DOCTORS SAY MORE PEOPLE COULD
BENEFIT (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The number of diseases that the GLP-1 category of drugs seems to be
effective in treating is expanding rapidly. The drug could be
beneficial to a third to a majority of adults. Many of the proven and
potential benefits of the drugs cascade from their effect on obesity,
but some are independent of weight loss, possibly from the
anti-inflammatory effects of the drugs. 

 TSMC BETS ON UNORTHODOX OPTICAL TECH (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 TSMC is working with startup Avicena to produce microLED-based
interconnects. The technology is designed to meet the high needs of
communication among an increasing number of GPUs in a low-cost,
energy-efficient way. AI clusters are facing unprecedented
requirements - sooner or later, the copper wires that connect
processors and memory within a single AI data rack will have to be
replaced with optics. Avicena's approach is very unorthodox, but it is
ideal for these short-distance applications.

 ASK HN: ANYONE STRUGGLING TO GET VALUE OUT OF CODING LLMS? (HACKER
NEWS THREAD) [10] 

 While some engineers can't seem to stop raving about how much of a
superpower large language models are for coding, others find it to be
an extremely finicky process that requires an extreme amount of
coddling to get average results at best. This could be because of the
type of work the engineers are doing - AI seems to be productive for
greenfield work, but it is pretty useless when it comes to maintaining
existing systems, adding more complicated features, or needing to know
business domain details. Some engineers find it much quicker and
easier to just write code themselves as they always do a better job in
the end. 

 I THINK IT'S TIME TO GIVE NIX A CHANCE (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Nix was designed to solve the lack of true reproducibility in
software development. While it has been around for two decades, Nix
has largely flown under the radar of mainstream development. This is
likely due to its steep learning curve. However, the tooling around
Nix has matured significantly, so it's now worth giving it a try.

 BIG BANKS EXPLORE VENTURING INTO CRYPTO WORLD TOGETHER WITH JOINT
STABLECOIN (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The biggest banks in the US are in discussions about whether to team
up and issue a joint stablecoin. The talks are in early stages and any
final decision would depend on how stablecoins will be legislated.
Banks have been bracing for the possibility that stablecoins could
become widely adopted under President Trump. Stablecoins could speed
up more routine transactions, but there is still some skepticism about
the security of the technology and the regulatory implications of
getting involved with digital assets. 

 $1M REVENUE, $0 PROFIT: OUR D2C REALITY CHECK (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Kodgem built its business around a device that helped people with
their posture. Despite the company's growth to $1 million in revenue,
there was zero profit for its founders due to several mistakes,
including inventory planning disasters, no real financial management,
and failed marketplace partnerships. The founders never paid
themselves, causing them to almost burn out completely multiple times.
They had gotten caught up in the growth story and forgotten the most
basic rule of business: you need to make more money than you spend.
