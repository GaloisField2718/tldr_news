 FEEL LIKE YOUR TABS HAVE TABS? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Developer tool sprawl is real. You've got one tab for logs, another
for metrics, half a dozen for cloud services, and somewhere in there
is the code you're actually trying to ship.

🫣 Stop playing hide-and-seek with your tools. Microsoft Azure [4]
brings together everything you need to build and run software in a
single workspace.

Goodbye, hunting for the right dashboard. Hello, one unified

 THE MICROSOFT-OPENAI FILES: INTERNAL DOCUMENTS REVEAL THE REALITIES
OF AI'S DEFINING ALLIANCE (27 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk's lawsuit accusing OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman of
abandoning the nonprofit mission has unveiled over 200 documents that
offer an inside look into the relationship between OpenAI and
Microsoft. Musk, an OpenAI co-founder, is seeking up to $134 billion
in damages, with a jury trial scheduled for this Spring. The files
reveal how Microsoft pursued, rebuffed, and backed OpenAI at various
moments over the past decade. The previously undisclosed emails,
messages, slide decks, reports, and deposition transcripts show how
Microsoft ultimately shaped the course of the lab that launched the
generative AI era. 

 X OPEN SOURCES ITS ALGORITHM WHILE FACING A TRANSPARENCY FINE AND
GROK CONTROVERSIES (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 X has open sourced its algorithm, giving the world a peek behind the
company's algorithmic curtain. The site's algorithm considers
engagement history and surveys recent in-network posts when finding
content for individual users. It conducts a machine-learning-based
analysis of 'out of network' posts that it believes the user might
also find appealing. The algorithm then filters out certain kinds of
posts, as well as content deemed too violent or spam-like, and ranks
the content based on what it thinks users will find most appealing.

 MODERNA, MERCK REPORT POSITIVE RESULTS FROM CANCER-VACCINE STUDY (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In a Phase 2b trial, Moderna and Merck's cancer vaccine reduced the
risk of relapse or death in melanoma patients by 49% when used in
combination with Merck's immunotherapy Keytruda, compared to when
using Keytruda alone. The results illustrate mRNA's potential in
cancer care. The treatment continues to demonstrate sustained and
clinically meaningful improvement. The companies are currently running
eight Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials across multiple tumor types.


 THE FIRST COMMERCIAL SPACE STATION, HAVEN-1, IS NOW UNDERGOING
ASSEMBLY FOR LAUNCH (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The International Space Station is due to be decommissioned in less
than five years, but NASA has yet to formally publish rules and
requirements for a potential replacement. There are currently four
main contenders for NASA's commercial space station program: Voyager
Technologies, Axiom Space, Blue Origin, and Vast Space. NASA is
expected to select one or two of these companies for contracts later
this year. This article contains an interview with Vast's chief
executive, Max Haot. Vast is currently building a smaller interim
space station capable of short-duration stays called Haven-1.

 📊 HOW MANY DASHBOARDS IS TOO MANY? (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Every new monitoring tool, service, or "quick integration" adds
another dashboard to the pile—and before you know it, you're
spending more time switching between tools than actually building.
With Microsoft Azure [10], your entire stack lives in one workspace:
infrastructure, data, AI, and more. See how Azure brings it all
together → [10] 

 MCP, SKILLS, AND AGENTS (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Harnesses are constantly improving by iterating on what works well.
However, every time someone releases a new behavior, the thought
leaders of the internet determine that it has replaced all previous
functionality. Developers should try both skills and MCP to learn the
fundamentals of how the technology works and what that means for
managing the context window. How the technologies shift in the future
depends entirely on the workflows they help people solve. 

 SKILLS.SH (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Skills are reusable capabilities for AI agents. This site contains an
open agent skills ecosystem with a collection of skills anyone can
install with a single command to enhance their agents with access to
procedural knowledge. The site contains thousands of skills. The index
is searchable and shows how many times each skill has been installed.

 I'M ADDICTED TO BEING USEFUL (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 People think software engineers are addicted to being useful, driven
by an addiction to solving puzzles, or drawn by power and money. What
actually motivates software engineers is often more of an internal
compulsion. It's worth figuring out what really motivates you so that
you can harness that compulsion most effectively. 

 AGENTIC AI AND THE MYTHICAL AGENT-MONTH (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The concept of 'Scalable Agency', where a developer could
theoretically spin up thousands of agents to complete tasks faster,
relies on a flawed assumption that software engineering is an
embarrassingly parallel task. Context loading is not the same as
common knowledge, and reading tokens is not the same as understanding
the causal chain of changes across a system. Adding manpower to a late
software project makes it later. Multi-agent systems do not escape
this law, they simply hit the wall of state-space explosion faster
than humans do.
