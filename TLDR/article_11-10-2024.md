 TESLA CYBERCAB ANNOUNCED: ELON MUSK'S ROBOTAXI IS FINALLY HERE (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla has unveiled the Cybercab, a new electric vehicle dedicated to
self-driving that lacks a steering wheel or pedals. It will need
approval from regulators before going into production. The robotaxi
features a futuristic design with doors that open upward and a small
cabin with only enough space for two passengers. It doesn't have a
charging plug - the vehicle will use inductive charging to regain
power wirelessly. Tesla plans to have the Cybercab in production by
2026, although that could be delayed until 2027.

 CAN APPLE WATCH MEASURE BLOOD PRESSURE? NOT YET — BUT HERE'S HOW
THE SCIENCE WOULD WORK. (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post explains the science behind blood pressure detection on the
wrist, past medical literature on using deep neural networks to glean
signals from consumer wearables, likely limitations of wrist-based
blood pressure sensors, and how doctors and patients can incorporate
the technology into medical practice. 120 million people in the US
have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, but only 23% have it
under control. A continuous blood pressure monitor could help give
real-time feedback on dietary choices and help control the condition,
which in turn could lower heart attack rates.

 FORKING IS BEAUTIFUL (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 FreeWP is a fork of WordPress started by a former WordPress community
member. The last decent fork attempt for WordPress was ClassicPress in
2018, which started over disagreements about Gutenberg being
integrated into core. WordPress itself started as a fork of the
b2/cafelog project. Matt Mullenweg, co-creator of WordPress, strongly
encourages anyone who disagrees with the direction WordPress is headed
in to join the FreeWP fork.

 GENERATIVE AI'S ACT O1 (22 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Research in AI is progressing from 'thinking fast' to 'thinking
slow', unlocking a new cohort of agentic applications. The focus is
now shifting to the development and scaling of the reasoning layer,
which could endow AI systems with deliberate reasoning,
problem-solving, and cognitive operations at inference time that go
beyond rapid pattern matching. This essay explores how the
consolidation of the foundational LLM layer has set the stage for the
race to scale higher-order reasoning and agentic capabilities, and
discusses a new generation of killer apps with novel cognitive
architectures and user interfaces.

widespread fraud and manipulation in crypto markets. The DOJ
reportedly secured $25 million from fraudulent proceeds that will be
returned to investors.
