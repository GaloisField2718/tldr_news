 DOES YOUR ENGINEERING ORGANIZATION RUN ON VIBES? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In 2024, the name of the game is effectiveness. But if you're not
measuring the right things - or not measuring at all - you're not
going to get better.

Swarmia [4] gives you the visibility you need to build the right
things, faster:

>>Less guesswork, more data [4]. Understand where precious engineering
time goes and catch delivery risks early.

>>Measure healthy productivity metrics [4], fix common anti-patterns,
and systematically improve the way you work.

>>Improve developer experience [4] with team-wide working agreements,
automated feedback loops, and developer surveys.

 GOOGLE REPORTEDLY IN ADVANCED TALKS TO ACQUIRE CYBER STARTUP WIZ FOR
$23 BILLION, ITS LARGEST-EVER DEAL (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google may be acquiring cybersecurity firm Wiz for $23 billion. Wiz,
founded in 2020, had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May, when it
achieved a valuation of $12 billion. Its security offering gives
companies insight into their full cloud presence. If completed, the
deal will be Google's largest acquisition yet. 

 SPACEX ROCKET ACCIDENT LEAVES THE COMPANY'S STARLINK SATELLITES IN
THE WRONG ORBIT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A SpaceX rocket has failed for the first time in nearly a decade. The
upper stage engine of the Falcon 9 rocket malfunctioned several
minutes into flight. It left 20 Starlink satellites in an orbit less
than half of what was intended. The company is attempting to boost
some of the satellites to a higher orbit using onboard ion thrusters,
but it is unlikely to be successful. The satellites will likely return
to the atmosphere and burn up. The Federal Aviation Administration
says the problem must be fixed before SpaceX can fly its Falcon
rockets again.

 EX-META SCIENTISTS DEBUT GIGANTIC AI PROTEIN DESIGN MODEL (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 EvolutionaryScale, a company launched by ex-Meta scientists, applies
cutting-edge machine learning models trained on language and images to
biological data. It has developed a model that speaks the language of
proteins called ESM3. ESM3 can be used to create proteins to
specifications provided by users. It has been used to create new
fluorescent molecules. A small version of the model that was trained
without data from specific viruses, pathogens, and toxins has been
open sourced. 

 THIS IS THE FASTEST OBJECT EVER MADE BY HUMANS, AND IT'S NOT SLOWING
DOWN (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 NASA's Parker Solar Probe was recorded traveling at 635,266
kilometers per hour on June 29. It is expected to reach a top speed of
around 692,000 kph when it makes its closest approach to the Sun in
2025. The probe uses Venus' gravity to create a sort of
gravity-powered slingshot to reach its incredible speeds. It will
eventually get within 6.12 million kilometers of the layer of ionized
gas considered to be the Sun's surface.

 CAN CHATGPT DO DATA SCIENCE? (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The challenges of using ChatGPT are worse for data science tasks.
Data scientists often work with very large data sets that have quality
issues on tasks that may require domain expertise. Using ChatGPT will
mean that data scientists also have to understand the context, data,
code, and assumptions in ChatGPT's responses. Data scientists are
still undecided whether tasks in the field are suitable for ChatGPT or
not.

 OPENAI REVENUE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Sam Altman projected $3.4 billion in annual recurring revenue for
OpenAI in June. This report takes a look at publicly available data to
calculate whether this projection is accurate. Most of OpenAI's
revenue comes from ChatGPT Plus subscribers, with around 21% coming
from ChatGPT Enterprise and 15% from the API. The full report is
available in the article. 

 HERE'S HOW MUCH VALVE PAYS ITS STAFF ‚Äî AND HOW FEW PEOPLE IT
EMPLOYS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Valve employed just 336 staff in 2021. Its small number of staff
across the board seems to explain why the company's product list is so
limited despite its immense business. Its profitability per employee
is higher than that of Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. A table
containing employee pay data from Valve sorted by year and category is
available in the article.
