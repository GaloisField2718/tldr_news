 EVERYTHING APPLE PLANS TO SHOW AT ITS IOS 26-FOCUSED WWDC 2025 EVENT
(10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference will focus on design and
productivity enhancements for its long-established operating system
franchises. The keynote address will begin at 10 AM PT today. It will
introduce redesigned software interfaces for the iPhone, iPad, Mac,
Apple TV, and Apple Watch, along with minor tweaks to the Vision Pro
headset. Apple also plans to introduce a sweeping change to its
software brand, shifting version numbers to a year-based system. The
AI changes that Apple plans to introduce will be minor and are
unlikely to impress industry watchers. 

 MICROSOFT AND ASUS ANNOUNCE TWO XBOX ALLY HANDHELDS WITH NEW XBOX
FULL-SCREEN EXPERIENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft and Asus have been working together over the past year to
create two new ROG Xbox Ally handhelds. The white ROG Xbox Ally ships
with AMD's Ryzen Z2 A processor and the ROG Ally X adds a better AMD
processor and impulse triggers. The hardware specs make them very
similar to Asus' existing Windows-powered handheld gaming PCs, but
there are much-needed changes to the software side that make the
experience a lot better. There are tweaks to the operating system,
Xbox PC app, and Game Bar to make Windows more handheld-friendly. The
reveal trailer for the devices is available in the article.

 BREAKTHROUGH IN SEARCH FOR HIV CURE LEAVES RESEARCHERS
‘OVERWHELMED' (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have found a way to force HIV out of hiding inside human
cells. HIV's ability to conceal itself within certain white blood
cells has been one of the main challenges for scientists looking for a
cure. Further research is required to determine whether revealing the
virus is enough to allow the body's immune system to deal with it or
whether other technologies or therapies will need to be used to
eliminate it from the body. The method will require successful tests
in animals followed by safety trials in humans before efficacy trials
can even begin. 

 BYD'S FIVE-MINUTE CHARGING PUTS CHINA IN THE LEAD FOR EVS (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 BYD's 1,000-kilowatt fast chargers make charging an EV as quick as a
gasoline fill-up. They can supply nearly 250 miles of fresh range in
five minutes. BYD designs its own cars, chargers, and batteries - this
vertical integration puts the company in a unique position in terms of
engineering control. This article discusses the technologies that
enable the company's megawatt charging speeds.

 MCP VS API (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Model Context Protocol (MCP) isn't just another API standard, it's a
wire protocol that enforces consistency. It allows developers to test,
sanitize inputs, and handle errors in actual code and not just hope
that the model formats requests correctly. MCP agents query
capabilities dynamically and adapt automatically while running as a
local process. The protocol's standardization creates an opportunity
to have consistent patterns across all servers. The practical path
forward involves maintaining APIs for human developers while adding
MCP for AI agent integration. 

 FIELD NOTES FROM SHIPPING REAL CODE WITH CLAUDE (37 MINUTE READ) [10]


 This is a field guide on AI-assisted development. It explores how to
genuinely achieve a 10x productivity boost, the infrastructure used at
Julep to ship production code daily using Claude, and why writing your
own tests remains absolutely sacred. Good development practices are
the difference between an AI that amplifies your capabilities and one
that amplifies chaos. Research shows that teams that use rigorous
practices deploy more frequently and are faster from commit to
deployment - this effect is even more pronounced when you add capable
AI assistants into the mix.

 THE HIDDEN TIME BOMB IN THE TAX CODE THAT'S FUELING MASS TECH LAYOFFS
(14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954 guaranteed that US companies
could deduct 100% of the qualified research and development spending
in the year they incurred the costs. This incentivized companies to
develop their products in the US and fueled the rise of smartphones,
cloud computing, and mobile apps. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed
during President Donald Trump's first term slashed the corporate tax
rate from 35% to 21%, but it also added a future provision that meant
that companies must spread the research and development deduction in
smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods. The provision went
into effect in 2022, making companies' biggest source of expenses now
a painful tax bill, which fueled mass layoffs. 

 WELCOME TO CAMPUS. HERE'S YOUR CHATGPT (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI is selling premium AI services to universities for faculty and
student use and running marketing campaigns aimed at getting students
to use ChatGPT. It plans to overhaul college education by embedding
its artificial intelligence tools in every facet of campus life. The
company wants universities to give students AI assistants to help
guide and tutor them. In its 'AI-native universities' plan, professors
would provide customized AI study bots for each class, career services
would offer recruiter chatbots for students to practice job
interviews, and students would be able to use chatbots to quiz them
before tests.

 SPECIFICATION ENGINEERING (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Declarative engineering is fine when software is 99% Python logic and
