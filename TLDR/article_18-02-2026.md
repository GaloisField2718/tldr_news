 APPLE RAMPS UP WORK ON GLASSES, PENDANT, AND CAMERA AIRPODS FOR AI
ERA (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is accelerating development on smart glasses, a pendant that
can be pinned to a shirt or worn as a necklace, and AirPods with
expanded AI capabilities. All three devices are being built around the
Siri digital assistant. They will rely on visual context to carry out
actions. Apple is also developing a range of AI devices for the home,
including a smart display built, an updated HomePod speaker, and a
compact indoor sensor for home security and automation. 

 TESLA BEGINS CYBERCAB PRODUCTION. NOW COMES THE HARD PART (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Tesla's first purpose-built driverless vehicle has rolled off the
Gigafactory Texas production line. The CyberCab is a two-seater coupe
that comes without a steering wheel or pedals, fully relying on the
company's Full-Self Driving software for control. Robotaxis are
central to Tesla's plans and could unlock trillions of dollars in
value. The CyberCab uses a production technique that is extremely
hard, so the early production rate is expected to be 'agonizingly
slow', but it will eventually scale up to produce up to five million
robotaxis a year.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SOUPED-UP CRISPR GENE EDITOR REPLICATES AND SPREADS LIKE A VIRUS (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A team at the University of California Berkeley and collaborators
have modified CRISPR-Cas9 to replicate and spread to other cells. The
scientists added genetic instructions for cells to make a virus-like
transporter that can encapsulate the CRISPR machinery, and once
manufactured in treated cells, the CRISPR cargo ships to neighboring
cells. The upgraded editor is roughly three times more effective at
gene editing lab-grown cells compared to standard CRISPR. It increases
the safety profile of gene-editing treatments and potentially expands
the technology to tissues and organs that are more challenging to
genetically alter than the liver. 

 THE SWEET LESSON OF NEUROSCIENCE (28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The implications of understanding the brain's steering circuits go
beyond AI. Many psychiatric conditions can be seen as failures of
internal teaching. Answering how sophisticated, within-lifetime
teaching actually works inside mammalian brains could link psychiatry,
developmental neuroscience, and new ideas for AI alignment into a
research program. Brains are architectures of internal teachers. We
should try to find these teachers and learn from them.

 INTRODUCING CLAUDE SONNET 4.6 (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Claude Sonnet 4.6 features a full upgrade of the model's skills
across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning,
knowledge work, and design. It has a 1 million token context window.
The model has very strong safety behaviors, with no signs of major
concerns around high-stakes forms of misalignment. Claude Sonnet 4.6
is available now on all Claude plans, Claude Cowork, Claude Code,
Anthropics API, and all major cloud platforms. 

 CODING AGENTS IN FEB 2026 (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Different coding agents are good at different tasks - the best way to
decide which to use is to choose based on time and whether it needs to
run autonomously or collaboratively. Model performance and speed is
governed both by the pure performance of the model and also how well
it can manage multiple context windows and delegate to sub-agents or
teams of agents. This article discusses several coding agents and how
best to use each of them. Ideas, architecture, and project sequencing
are becoming the limiting factors for building great products.

 REALITY'S MOAT (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vertical AI is a fertile ground for moats. These products share
operational knowledge packaged as services. Customers stay because of
their own experience of relying on the product under stress. Trust
leads the customer to bring harder problems, harder problems generate
deeper operational knowledge, and this deeper knowledge earns more
trust. Any newcomer trying to enter the market starts at the bottom. 

 WARNER BROS. REJECTS PARAMOUNT AGAIN BUT ASKS FOR “BEST AND FINAL
OFFER” (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Warner Bros. Discovery is giving Paramount one more week to make its
best and final offer despite officially still being committed to
Netflix. The company has recommended shareholders vote for the Netflix
merger. Netflix has provided Warner Bros. with a limited waiver that
permits Warner Bros. to engage in discussions with Paramount until
February 23. Netflix is set to pay $27.75 per share for an acquisition
that includes HBO Max, WB Studios, and other assets. Paramount has
offered $31 per share, but it wants to buy the entire company.
