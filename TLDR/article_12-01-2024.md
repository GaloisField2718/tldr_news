 GOOGLE CONFIRMS IT JUST LAID OFF AROUND A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has eliminated around a thousand positions across its Pixel,
Nest, Fitbit, Core engineering, and Assistant teams. The company may
still be planning further layoffs. Google's parent company Alphabet
employed 182,385 employees as of September 30 last year. The layoffs
so far represent around half a percent of the company's total
employees. 

 ‚ÄúSUCH SIGNAL, MUCH WOW‚Äù: STARLINK‚ÄôS FIRST TEXTS VIA
‚ÄúCELLPHONE TOWERS IN SPACE‚Äù (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX has successfully sent and received its first text messages
using the T-Mobile network spectrum through one of its new
direct-to-cell satellites. The new satellites are expected to provide
text messaging services around the world sometime this year, with
voice and data services beginning sometime in 2025. They are equipped
with custom silicon, phased array antennas, and advanced software
algorithms. The satellite-to-phone service should work just about
anywhere on the planet, but it will be most useful in areas with no
coverage due to terrain limitations, land-use restrictions, and other
factors.

LUXURY MINI-HOME (3 MINUTE READ) [8]

400 square feet of living space, solar panels, and much more. The RV
features a luxurious interior, smart tech, and clean energy for
off-grid capabilities. It has a gourmet kitchen, a spacious living and

 CHINESE RIVAL TO SPACEX PULLS OFF ROCKET LAUNCH AT SEA (1 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Orienspace declared a complete success after launching a rocket at
sea into low-Earth orbit on Thursday. Its rocket deposited a total of
three satellites into orbit using its Gravity 1 commercial launch
system. The three-stage, 100-foot-tall spacecraft is the world's
largest solid launch vehicle. Launching from the sea offers several
advantages, including less chance of damage and lower costs.

 GITHUB ACTIONS AS A TIME-SHARING SUPERCOMPUTER (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GitHub Actions can be used for batch jobs. Developers can submit work
to the service and receive the results later on asynchronously.
actions-batch is a command-line tool that is essentially an API that
turns GitHub Actions into a time-sharing computer. It creates new
GitHub repositories, writes a workflow that runs 'job.sh' upon
commits, and triggers jobs when a local bash file is written to the
repository as 'job.sh'. actions-batch can be used for jobs like
building kernels and running machine learning inference using Llama2. 

 GOOGLE CHALLENGES CLOUD RIVALS BY MAKING IT FREE FOR CUSTOMERS TO
TRANSFER DATA WHEN THEY LEAVE (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google's cloud unit will stop charging data transfer fees when
customers want to leave. The change applies to all customers globally.
Data transfer fees are a profitable source of revenue for tech
companies and they can reduce churn as they punish clients for going
elsewhere. Google is part of the Bandwidth Alliance, a group of
companies whose aim is to reduce or eliminate data transfer fees.
Alibaba, Microsoft, and Oracle are also members of the alliance.

 CHROME USERS NOW WORTH 30% LESS MONEY THANKS TO GOOGLE'S COOKIE
KILLING, AD FIRM SAYS (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google disabled tracking cookies for 30 million Chrome users last
week, about 1% of the browser's user base. Analysts estimate that the
change made cookieless users bring in 30% less revenue. Google plans
to block cookies for all users by the end of the year and replace them
with a new tracking system called the Privacy Sandbox. The new system
will keep all user data on users' devices but let companies still know
what topics they're interested in. 

 UNDERSTANDING BRIDGE-BASED RANKING (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Bridge-based ranking is a way to score and rank content by adjusting
for user polarization. The algorithm works by attempting to model why
content receives the reactions it gets and then correcting for bias.
It can cancel out the effects of bias. This article explains
Bridge-Based Ranking and shows how and why it works. Bridge-based
ranking allows communities to self-moderate by preventing influence
from user polarization.
