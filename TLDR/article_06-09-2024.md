 TELEGRAM'S FOUNDER, IN FIRST COMMENTS SINCE ARREST, DEFENDS THE APP
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Telegram founder Pavel Durov says that innovators should not be
personally liable for the potential abuse of the tools they create. He
says that growing pains on Telegram made it easy for criminals to
abuse the platform, but that he aims to significantly improve the
platform. French authorities arrested Durov in part due to Telegram's
apparent lack of response to requests related to criminal
investigations, but Durov says Telegram has official representatives
in the EU and that he had personally helped French authorities
establish a hotline with Telegram to deal with the threat of terrorism
in France. Telegram is expected to announce changes to address the
abuse of its platform very soon. 

 OPENAI CONSIDERS $2,000 MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION PRICES FOR NEW LLMS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI executives are reportedly considering $2,000 per month
subscription prices for the company's upcoming large language models.
The company plans to release its next-level artificial intelligence
product, Strawberry, in the fall. Strawberry will be able to solve
novel math problems, develop market strategies, and perform deep
research. OpenAI is also reportedly considering changing its corporate
structure to be more simple and attractive to financial backers. It is
aiming to raise several billion dollars in a funding round that would
value it at above $100 billion.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE ULTRA-SELFISH GENE (35 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It is now possible for humans to genetically modify entire species by
inserting genes into them with brute force. The technology has so far
gone unused, even though its deployment could mean the end of diseases
like malaria. It could be used for many positive things such as giving
raccoons immunity to rabies, editing insects so that they're more
vulnerable to safer pesticides, and preventing the spread of deadly
diseases. However, its existence presents many issues, such as the
possibility of a harmful gene being released into human populations. 

 A NEXT-GEN PAIN DRUG SHOWS PROMISE, BUT CHRONIC SUFFERERS NEED MORE
OPTIONS (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vertex Pharmaceuticals is currently seeking regulatory approval for a
new drug that looks promising in clinical trials. Suzetrigine could be
the first of an entirely new class of pain therapy. It targets
specific sodium ion channels found on pain-sensing nerve cells. While
the effect of the drug is modest, it demonstrates that the strategy of
targeting sodium channels specific to pain-sensing neurons works,
leading to hope that the next generation of these compounds could
perform much better. Suzetrigine could be approved by early 2025.

 THE AI INDUSTRY IS OBSESSED WITH CHATBOT ARENA, BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE
THE BEST BENCHMARK (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 LMSYS' Chatbot Arena has become an industry obsession over the past
few months. It lets anyone on the web ask questions of two randomly
selected, anonymous models and then vote on their preferred answers.
Critics say that LMSYS has not been completely transparent about the
model capabilities, knowledge, and skills it's assessing on Chatbot
Arena. The limited data released by the company makes it challenging
to study the limitations of models in depth. While Chatbot Arena is
framed as an empirical test, it amounts to a relative rating of
models.
