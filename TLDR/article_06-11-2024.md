 OPENAI HIRES META'S FORMER ORION HEAD TO LEAD ITS ROBOTICS EFFORTS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Caitlin Kalinowski, the former head of Meta's Orion augmented reality
glasses initiative, has joined OpenAI to lead its robotics and
consumer hardware efforts. The hiring is part of OpenAI's efforts to
move into building and selling hardware. Kalinowski was a hardware
executive at Meta for nearly two and a half years and has worked for
more than nine years on virtual reality headsets. She has also helped
design MacBook Pro and Air models. 

 ANTHROPIC'S HAIKU 3.5 SURPRISES EXPERTS WITH AN “INTELLIGENCE”
PRICE INCREASE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic launched the latest version of its smallest AI model,
Claude 3.5 Haiku, with a 4x price increase on Monday. The company says
that the price increase reflects the model's increase in intelligence.
The new Haiku model costs users $1 per million input tokens and $5 per
million output tokens. Anthropic's testing indicates that the new
Haiku model surpasses Claude 3 Opus, which costs $15 per million input
tokens and $75 per million output tokens.

 WORLD'S 1ST CLONED FERRET GIVES BIRTH TO HEALTHY KITS IN A
CONSERVATION MILESTONE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A cloned black-footed ferret has given birth to two healthy kits, a
milestone that represents a significant step to securing the future of
the endangered mammal. The cloned ferret was created from genetic
material collected in 1988 and preserved at the San Diego Zoo's Frozen
Zoo. The sample was unique in its genetic diversity, meaning its genes
could strengthen the current population's health and resilience. All
living black-footed ferrets, except for clones and the new kits,
descend from seven wild ferrets. The limited gene pool makes the
population highly vulnerable to diseases and less adaptable to
environmental changes. 

 WORLD'S FIRST WOODEN SATELLITE LAUNCHED INTO SPACE (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Japanese researchers launched the world's first wooden satellite into
space yesterday. The satellite is made of honoki, a kind of magnolia
tree traditionally used to make sword sheaths. The researchers believe
that the material can be used to build structures in space. They plan
to collect data on the satellite for six months, and if the experiment
is successful, pitch the idea of wooden satellites to SpaceX. Pictures
of the wooden satellite are available in the article.

 NEW OPENAI FEATURE: PREDICTED OUTPUTS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The OpenAI API has a new feature called Predicted Outputs. It allows
users to send content as a 'prediction' and have GPT-4o or GPT-4o mini
use that content to accelerate the returned result. Any tokens
provided in predictions that are not part of the final completion will
be charged at completion token rates. This means the more an output
differs from the prediction, the more it will cost. Using Predicted
Outputs can reduce processing time. 

 WHY SOFTWARE ONLY MOVES FORWARD (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Software only moves forward mostly because of data. Code needs to
understand saved states, especially if that state leaves a system to
become distributed. Developers can usually update code, but not the
database. Distributed systems greatly increase the complexity of this
problem. This article provides some tips on how to update software
while keeping users happy.

 APPLE REPORTEDLY FACING FIRST-EVER EU FINE OVER APP STORE RULES (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The EU Commission is planning to fine Apple over the company's
'anti-steering' practices, which harm competition in the App Store. It
is unknown how much the EU plans to fine Apple, but the Digital
Markets Act says companies can be charged up to 10% of annual global
revenue and up to 20% for repeat offenses. The initial fine could be
as much as $38 billion based on Apple's revenue last year. Apple is
also facing an investigation over whether it is undermining
alternative app stores in the EU. 

 WHY THE DEEP LEARNING BOOM CAUGHT ALMOST EVERYONE BY SURPRISE (23
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The AI boom of the last 12 years was made possible by three
visionaries who pursued unorthodox ideas in the face of widespread
criticism. Geoffrey Hinton spent decades promoting neural networks
despite near-universal skepticism. Jensen Huang recognized early that
GPUs could be useful for more than just graphics. Fei-Fei Li created
an image data set that turned out to be essential for demonstrating
the potential of neural networks trained on GPUs. This article tells
the story of how these figures contributed to the AI boom.
