Amazon's bid seriously. Neither company has spoken publicly about the
bid. Despite multiple bids, TikTok has maintained that it is not for
sale, partly because the Chinese government would block a deal.

 AMAZON TO LAUNCH FIRST BATCH OF KUIPER SATELLITES ON APRIL 9 (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amazon's Kuiper internet satellites are scheduled to take off on
United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral on April 9
at 12 PM ET. Project Kuiper, which launched in 2019, aims to provide
broadband internet from a constellation of more than 3,000 satellites.
Amazon completed the first test of its service in October 2023 and was
expected to set its first operational satellites aloft last year, but
the launch was delayed in favor of two US Space Force missions. Amazon
is marketing Kuiper to consumers who lack adequate access to broadband
internet, along with governments and companies.

 GREPPING LOGS REMAINS TERRIBLE (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Databases were created because scanning through raw data over and
over again was inefficient and did not scale. This applies to logs
just as much as any other kind of data. Programs should output to a
log-ready database - this will make querying them require less
computing power and RAM and take less time. It also enables
aggregations, computations, build stats, and many other database
functionalities.
