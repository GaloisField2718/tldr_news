TLDR 2025-05-29

 PROPTECH PACASO RESERVES NASDAQ TICKER _PCSO —_ $75M ROUND IS STILL
OPEN TO PUBLIC AT THE CURRENT PRICE UNTIL TODAY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Remember watching Zillow go from startup to a $16B public company?
Spencer Rascoff does - he co-founded it.

Now he's doing it again with Pacaso [4], the vacation home
co-ownership platform that's already generated $110M+ in gross profits
and $1.1B in real estate transactions.

The difference this time? You can invest privately in Pacaso.

Starting at just $2.80/share [4], you can own equity alongside
SoftBank, Fifth Wall, and other institutional investors who typically
keep these opportunities to themselves.

But you need to act quickly - because today (May 29) is the LAST DAY
to invest at the current share price. Invest now at $2.80/share. [4]

 APPLE TO LAUNCH IOS 26, MACOS 26 IN MAJOR REBRAND TIED TO SOFTWARE
REDESIGNS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The next Apple operating systems will be identified by year rather
than version number. The change is aimed at bringing consistency to
the company's branding and making things less confusing to customers
and developers. The next operating systems will be known as iOS 26,
iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. The shift
will be announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on June
9. 

 XAI TO PAY TELEGRAM $300M TO INTEGRATE GROK INTO THE CHAT APP (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Telegram and xAI have partnered to integrate Grok into apps available
on Telegram's platform for one year. xAI paid $300 million in cash and
equity as part of the deal. Telegram will also earn 50% of the revenue
from xAI subscriptions purchased through the app. Grok was already
available to Telegram's premium users early this year, but it seems
the chatbot is now going to be made available to all users.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 RESEARCHERS SAY NEW CONTACT LENSES LET YOU SEE IN THE DARK (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Scientists have created contact lenses that allow people to see in
the dark with the help of infrared light. The invention could allow
colorblind people to see colors again. The contacts don't require an
external power source and wearers can perceive multiple infrared
wavelengths even with their eyes closed. They aren't yet able to
capture fine details, so the scientists are working on a version with
more precise spatial resolution and higher sensitivity. 

 A REACTION TO ALZHEIMER'S FRAUD (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The beta-amyloid protein has been a prime suspect in the pathology of
Alzheimer's for many decades. However, there was a period where some
papers made a form of amyloid appear to be able to induce disease-like
symptoms all by itself in rodent models. Those works turned out not to
be reproducible, and there is strong evidence of deliberately faked
work in those papers. While those particular papers are fake, they
don't discount the decades of legitimate research on the topic.

 ONE OF THE REASONS I'M FINDING LLMS SO MUCH MORE USEFUL FOR CODING
THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 All of Simon Willison's code has automated tests. This massively
de-risks his use of large language models. He uses AI to write code
and then proves that code works with tests, then uses AI to refactor
the code until it looks good, keeping the tests green the whole time.
Programmers who find the technology to be more of a hindrance than a
help in their work may need to check the health of their test suites. 

 AS A DEVELOPER, MY MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS ARE A PEN AND A NOTEBOOK (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A notebook is the most important tool to have as a software
developer. While writing code is a necessary part of the job, more
important than writing that code is figuring out what code to write.
Writing and sketching are powerful tools for thinking through problems
and they can help turn vague abstract ideas into tangible artifacts.
Using a notebook also leaves behind a copy of your thoughts and the
process of how you reached them.

 ELON MUSK TRIED TO BLOCK SAM ALTMAN'S BIG AI DEAL IN THE MIDDLE EAST
(6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI and a group of American technology giants recently won a deal
to build one of the world's largest artificial intelligence data
centers in Abu Dhabi. While the deal was being made, Elon Musk worked
hard to make sure it included his own AI startup, warning the group
that the plan had no chance of presidential approval unless xAI was
included in the deal. Trump and US officials reviewed the deal terms
and decided to move forward. The project, Stargate UAE, was ultimately
announced on May 22. 

 WHAT IF WE HAD BIGGER BRAINS? IMAGINING MINDS BEYOND OURS (81 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 As humans, we like to think our minds are somehow at the top of
what's possible, but it is now pretty clear this isn't true.
Artificial neural networks allow us to get a more systematic sense of
what different scales of brains can do. As systems get more complex,
they may start using abstractions and higher-order constructs that we
are basically blind to.
