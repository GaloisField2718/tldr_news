 NVIDIA TO FINANCE MUSK'S XAI CHIPS AS PART OF $20 BILLION DEAL (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 xAI has raised its ongoing funding round to $20 billion, more than
initially planned. The financing includes equity and debt in a special
purpose vehicle that will buy Nvidia processors and rent them to xAI
for use in its Colossus 2 project. Nvidia is investing as much as $2
billion in the equity portion of the transaction. The funding effort
may continue to grow. 

 TESLA REVEALS CHEAPER VERSIONS OF ITS CARS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla has revealed cheaper versions of its Model Y and Model 3. The
new Model Y will cost $40,000, and the Model 3 will sell for $37,000.
They have the same basic body shapes as the existing models, but have
cloth interiors, fewer speakers, and less soundproofing. The cheaper
Model Y has dual headlights rather than a continuous illuminated bar.
Both vehicles can travel 320 miles between charges, slightly less than
the costlier versions.

 ENGINEERED PROTEIN THAT RESPONDS TO LIGHT COULD HELP RESTORE SIGHT (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Science Corp., a Californian company, has created an engineered
protein that could help blind people see. The protein, opsin, creates
electrical currents when hit with light. Opsins usually need a
powerful light source to generate a current, but Science's scientists
were able to create opsins that generate an electrical current when
exposed to regular indoor lighting. Science is currently building
several things, including a device to restore vision and a chip that
plugs into the brain using living neurons instead of wires - the new
protein could help with both pursuits. 

 2025 NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS AWARDED FOR MACROSCALE QUANTUM TUNNELING
(6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis have been
awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of
macroscopic quantum tunneling and energy quantization in an electrical
circuit. Their work opens up opportunities to develop next-generation
quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers,
and quantum sensors. They will split the prize money of $1.1 million.
The presentation ceremony will take place in Stockholm on December 10.

 BIRTH OF PRETTIER (30 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 It's been almost 10 years since Prettier was released. This post
tells the story of its birth and how technological innovation made an
underlying source of tension - spaces versus tabs - no longer a thing.
Prettier solved formatting, one of the most controversial engineering
topics, in the span of just a few years. It is now rare to see a
mainstream programming language that does not have a formatter that's
widely adopted by its community. 

 JSON SCHEMA COMPATIBILITY AND THE ROBUSTNESS PRINCIPLE (5 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Developers using a lenient policy with JSON Schema may prefer
backward compatibility over full compatibility. Full compatibility
doesn't allow developers to evolve sum types. The most common way to
evolve a sum type is by adding a new variant, which is a
backward-compatible change, but now a fully compatible one.

 OPENAI'S WINDOWS PLAY (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI is making a play to be the Windows of AI. While Apple's
strategy of integrating hardware and software was immensely
profitable, it left the door open for a competing platform to emerge.
Microsoft's DOS operating system put IBM in a dominant role and
secured Microsoft's position. OpenAI is trying to make ChatGPT the
operating system of the future. It has the users, and now it is trying
to attract developers. 

 QUALCOMM IS BUYING ARDUINO, RELEASES NEW RASPBERRY PI-ESQUE ARDUINO
BOARD (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Qualcomm is acquiring Arduino, an Italian company known mainly for
its open source ecosystem of microcontrollers and software. Arduino
will retain its independent brand, tools, and mission. The acquisition
still needs to be approved by regulators and go through other
customary closing conditions. While Arduino is committed to
open-source hardware and software, there are concerns that the
acquisition will mean that its ecosystem will eventually be locked
down.
