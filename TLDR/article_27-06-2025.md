 UBER IN TALKS WITH ITS FOUNDER, TRAVIS KALANICK, TO FUND SELF-DRIVING
CAR DEAL (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Uber is in talks with Travis Kalanick, the company's co-founder, to
help fund his acquisition of the US subsidiary of Chinese autonomous
vehicle company Pony.ai. Kalanick was forced out of Uber in a
boardroom coup eight years ago - after, he founded CloudKitchens,
where he will remain if the deal goes through. Pony.ai has permits to
operate robot taxis and trucks in the US and China. Kalanick will run
Pony.ai if the deal is completed. 

 GOOGLE BEGINS ROLLING OUT AI SEARCH ON YOUTUBE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has been transforming its web search into a zero-click
experience with AI, and now, the same focus is coming to YouTube.
Select searches on YouTube will now return a collection of relevant
videos with AI-generated summaries. Each summary will extract the
information most related to users' search queries, so they may not
even have to watch the videos. The AI results carousel is currently
being tested with YouTube Premium subscribers and is entirely opt-in.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE FAILURES AND FUTURES OF CANCER VACCINES (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The cancer vaccine field has yet to become a systematic science
despite decades of work. This article speculates on why the field has
failed and the next-gen approaches worth looking out for. One of the
core problems in cancer vaccine development lies in the nature of
neoantigens, which are often overwhelmingly similar to normal cellular
proteins. The field has had some tentative early successes in
pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, and a range of solid tumors. There
is potential for a startup to outcompete incumbents by exploring novel
target areas outside of the field's almost singular focus on single
nucleotide variants. 

 THE FIRST NON-OPIOID PAINKILLER (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The FDA approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Journavx (suzetrigine), the
first non-opioid pain reliever suitable for treating post-surgery
pain, in January. Clinical trials found that patients didn't show any
of the problematic side effects associated with opioids. Unlike
opioids, Journavx doesn't meaningfully interact with the brain - it
instead targets a specific sodium ion channel found almost exclusively
on peripheral nociceptors (pain-sensing neurons), blocking them from
sending pain signals to the brain. The drug is a product of 27 years
of research and billions of dollars.

agents. 

 SAVE YOUR DISK, WRITE FILES DIRECTLY INTO RAM WITH /DEV/SHM (2 MINUTE

 /dev/shm is a world-accessible RAM scratchpad available in virtually
every Unix (Linux system already has it mounted as a tmpfs by
default). Files in the folder perform much better as they are running
in RAM. The folder is cleared on reboot.

 SCALE AI'S SPAM, SECURITY WOES PLAGUED THE COMPANY WHILE SERVING
GOOGLE (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Scale AI's long relationship with Google was fraught with lapses in
security protocols for at least 11 months between March 2023 and April
2024. Scale AI's efforts to train Google AI programs were meant to be
exclusively staffed by experts in various specialties, but the program
instead became flooded by spammers who abused the system by submitting
transparently shoddy work that managed to evade detection. The
spammers were often paid because it was too difficult to detect them
due to their sheer numbers. 

 I FOUGHT IN UKRAINE AND HERE'S WHY FPV DRONES KIND OF SUCK (18 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 FPV drones are unmanned aerial vehicles commonly used in the Ukraine
war to deliver and detonate explosive charges of up to 1.5 kilograms.
While they are touted as a cheap and accessible solution for precision
strikes, their actual success rate, when including pre-aborted
missions, is between 20 to 30 percent. These drones are rarely
successful because they are often more expensive than other options,
hard to use, susceptible to electronic interference, and most don't
have night-vision capabilities, which is important for a battlefield
that's in the dark for 14 hours a day.
