 IT'S NOT JUST YOU: GOOGLE SEEMINGLY SCALED BACK AI OVERVIEWS AFTER
ITS ROCKY LAUNCH (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has scaled back AI Overviews. The AI-generated answers are now
appearing in around 11 percent of queries, down from around 27 percent
when the feature was launched last month. The company is still in the
process of refining the feature. AI Overviews are appearing most in
health-focused searches, despite the company highlighting the tool's
use for shopping, restaurant recommendations, and travel in its
marketing. 

 NVIDIA EMAILS: ELON MUSK DIVERTING TESLA GPUS TO HIS OTHER COMPANIES
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Elon Musk redirected 12,000 H100 GPUs ordered by Tesla to X. He had
told investors in April that Tesla had spent $1 billion on GPUs in the
three months of the year. Tesla has been developing its own in-house
supercomputer for AI, but Musk has previously said that it would be
redundant if the company could source more H100s. X's order of 12,000
H100s will be redirected to Tesla.

 FLAWED, SCANDALOUS TRIALS TANK FDA EXPERT SUPPORT FOR MDMA THERAPY (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Advisors for the Food and Drug Administration have voted
overwhelmingly against approving MDMA as part of a therapy for
post-traumatic stress disorder. While results from clinical trials
showed positive results, a deeper look at the data uncovered a large
number of trial flaws that threw the validity of the positive results
into serious question. The FDA is conducting an investigation into
accusations of possible data manipulation during the trials. There
were claims that some of the trial participants were discouraged from
reporting negative responses to the therapy. 

 ‚ÄòEXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE': MELANOMA JAB TRIAL RESULTS EXCITE DOCTORS
(3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A mRNA cancer vaccine for melanoma halves the risk of patients dying
or the disease returning after three years. The vaccine is
custom-built for each patient and specific to each patient's tumor.
The average risk of recurrence for the type of advanced cancer the
study focused on is 50%, but the vaccine brought the risk of
recurrence down to 25%. The data from the study suggests that levels
of cancer relapse did not increase in people with high-risk,
advanced-stage melanoma.

 SKIP SDKS IN SIMPLE INTEGRATIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 SDKs are not always beneficial and can complicate the development
process. They often organize API interactions differently to how
developers want them, have hidden complexities, use outdated
dependencies, and have learning overhead. Using direct API calls
allows for offline development, custom typing information, and easier
swapping of vendors. SDKs can still be useful for deep integration
with a service, but for simple API integrations, they introduce too
much unnecessary bloat and cognitive overhead.

 SITUATIONAL AWARENESS (BOOK) [14] 

 Everyone is talking about AI, but few know what is about to hit them.
This book looks at what the future holds for AI. It discusses the road
to AGI, superintelligence, scaling, security, and more. While many
people may think that those in the AI industry are crazy, those that
built the technology believe that it will change the world before the
decade is out. 

 INBOX TEN (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This post presents tips on how to stay up to date on information and
how to maintain an information ecosystem. Your ability to be effective
is a function of your ability to efficiently ingest the information
around you. Stay informed and advance your own work while also keeping
others informed so they can do the same. One of the most important
tools to use is to just decline to engage - don't let things linger or
get talked into work you don't think is a good use of your time.
