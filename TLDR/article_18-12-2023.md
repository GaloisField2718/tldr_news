 SWARMIA‚ÄôS LIST OF NON-TOXIC ENGINEERING METRICS (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Between GitHub, Jira/Linear, and Slack, engineering teams create a
lot of data. But measuring the wrong things can destroy motivation and
productivity.
Swarmia [5] has identified key metrics [5] that are more signal than
noise (including DORA and SPACE) ‚Äî and makes them available to
engineering leaders, managers, and teams. No leaderboards, no
individual performance data.

 META'S RAY-BAN GLASSES ADDED AI THAT CAN SEE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta's second-generation Ray-Ban glasses can interpret scenes and
make judgments using generative AI. A new update is rolling out a
feature that uses the on-glasses cameras to look at images and
interpret them. The update also brings Bing-powered search to the
glasses. This article contains some examples of how the feature can be
used. 

 WHY VISION PRO WILL CHANGE PHOTOGRAPHY (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple's Vision Pro will redefine our relationship with visual media
and content, creating many new possibilities for photographers and
filmmakers. Spatial video is a mixed-reality video format that allows
videos to record the depth and spatial information of a scene,
creating a more immersive three-dimensional experience. It is able to
create super immersive photos and videos that look amazing on the
Vision Pro. It will not be long before creators start thinking of
using the technology to tell a story.

 US NUCLEAR-FUSION LAB ENTERS NEW ERA: ACHIEVING ‚ÄòIGNITION‚Äô OVER
AND OVER (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists at the US National Ignition Facility announced that they
had achieved ignition in December 2022 after more than a decade of
effort. The team can now replicate the feat again and again. It has
achieved ignition in four out of its last six attempts. The latest
series of experiments features a 7% boost in laser energy, which in
theory should lead to larger yields. The team now plans to focus on
changes to produce a more symmetrical implosion. 

 WORLD‚ÄôS FIRST ‚ÄúSELF-AMPLIFYING‚Äù VACCINE APPROVED IN JAPAN (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Japan recently approved a COVID-19 vaccine that triggers the body to
produce an enzyme that makes copies of its antigen mRNA. It is the
first fully approved self-amplifying RNA vaccine. The technology
allows smaller doses of the vaccine to achieve the same level of
efficacy as current vaccines with cheaper shots, shorter manufacturing
times, and fewer side effects. Self-amplifying RNA vaccines could
prove to be a powerful weapon in the fight against cancer.

 PROMPT ENGINEERING (35 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This guide shares strategies and tactics for getting better results
from large language models. The methods can sometimes be combined for
greater effect. Some examples only work with the most capable models.
Strategies for getting better results include writing clearer
instructions, providing reference texts, splitting complex tasks into
simpler subtasks, and using external tools. 

 WHY SHOULD YOU (OR ANYONE) BECOME AN ENGINEERING MANAGER? (17 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Engineering management has changed a lot over the past decade.
Management seems a lot less attractive these days. However,
engineering managers are incredibly important and still needed.
Managers are responsible for the systems and structural support that
enable engineers to deliver products and outcomes. This article lists
reasons for engineers to become managers. One of the main reasons is
that becoming a manager can make you better at life and relationships
- the role changes who you are as a person and the relationships you
have with others.

 RAG TO RICHES (17 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article contains several stories about new developments in AI.
These stories cover the competition in the AI space, the state of
employment in the industry, AI strategies, Sourcegraph's Cody AI
coding assistant being generally available, and more. Engineers who
have committed to commenting on their code throughout the years have
provided incredibly valuable context to help large language models
reason about their code. The article takes a moment to thank those
coders for their service in helping out AI. 

 IF AI IS MAKING THE TURING TEST OBSOLETE, WHAT MIGHT BE BETTER? (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A team of researchers has proposed a novel framework that treats AI
programs as if they were a participant in a psychological study. It
has three steps: test the program in a set of experiments examining
its inferences, test its understanding of its own way of reasoning,
and examine, if possible, the cognitive adequacy of the source code
for the program. While current generations of AI programs have come
close to passing the Turing Test, the results don't imply that these
programs can think and reason like humans. The new framework could be
an alternative to the Turing Test for evaluating the intelligence of
programs.
