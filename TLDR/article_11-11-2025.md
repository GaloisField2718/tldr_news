TLDR 2025-11-11

 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native solution provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA
cycle to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks [6]—not years
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs [7]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of engineers [8] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

 ANTHROPIC IS ON TRACK TO TURN A PROFIT MUCH FASTER THAN OPENAI (7
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Anthropic expects to break even for the first time in 2028. OpenAI's
operating losses for 2028 are forecasted to swell to about $74 billion
- it doesn't expect to turn a profit until 2030. OpenAI is investing
far more into its chips and data centers to turn OpenAI into a
multitrillion-dollar tech giant. The strategy requires near-constant
fundraising, which could backfire if markets cool on the technology or
its near-term profitability. 

 IPHONE AIR SALES ARE SO BAD THAT APPLE'S DELAYING THE NEXT-GENERATION
VERSION (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Apple will delay the launch of the next-generation iPhone Air that
was scheduled to be released with the iPhone 18 Pro. The iPhone Air
has faced poor sales and manufacturing cuts. The novel look of the
device failed to spark interest, despite its substantial design
update. Apple is planning a split launch for the iPhone 18 models -
the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and foldable iPhone are planned
for the fall of 2026, while the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e will be
released in early 2027.

 ALTMAN AND MASA BACK A 27-YEAR-OLD'S PLAN TO BUILD A NEW BELL LABS
ULTRA (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Louis Andre, a 27-year-old who grew up in Europe, recently revealed a
new company backed by Sam Altman called Episteme. Episteme is an
effort to attract the world's top scientists and have them work on a
wide range of breakthrough products. It will allow scientists to do
away with fundraising pressures and grant writing and spend most of
their time on research. The company will also help scientists deal
with intellectual property concerns, tax issues, hiring, and other
day-to-day support functions to help them turn their ideas into
blockbuster products. 

 HERE'S HOW ORBITAL DYNAMICS WIZARDRY HELPED SAVE NASA'S NEXT MARS
MISSION (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 NASA's ESCAPADE mission is set to launch tomorrow at 2:50 PM EST on
Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket. The mission was delayed last year as
its rocket wasn't ready to send it to Mars during its appointed launch
window. Mars is now more than 220 million miles away from where it was
during last year's launch window - this isn't a big deal, as the
mission will follow a 'kidney-bean' shaped trajectory to reach the
planet. Such techniques are necessary if humans are to send hundreds
of spacecraft to Mars, as it would be difficult to launch only within
certain timeframes for direct flights.

 BECOMING A COMPILER ENGINEER (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Compiler engineers are software engineers who implement programming
languages. There is very little information online about how to break
into this niche - this post aims to help those interested in the field
understand what working in the role is like and how to get a job
working with compilers. Compiler engineer roles are relatively rare
due to limited demand - once a compiler is built, the work is mostly
maintenance and optimization, and most companies don't build their own
compilers. The job market can be brutal, but it's possible to stand
out even without a preexisting network. 

 GIT-REWRITE-COMMITS (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 git-rewrite-commits is an AI-powered git commit message writer. It
can automatically rewrite entire git commit histories with AI. The
tool is perfect for cleaning up commit histories before open-sourcing
projects. It can also aid in improving repository maintainability.

 META RAY-BAN DISPLAY REVIEW: FIRST GENERATION HEADS-UP MOBILE
COMPUTING (42 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Smartphones have become humanity's second cognitive organ, but using
the devices harshly disconnects users from the world around them. The
only form factor that seems to have a chance to replace the smartphone
is AR glasses. Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are still highly dependent
on mobile devices, and they only provide a small display visible to
one eye, but they give users a glimpse into what the future may look
like. This article provides a detailed review of the device along with
the Meta Neural Band that pairs with it. The technology is still very
much a first-generation product, but it shows promise. 

 WORK, ECONOMICS, AUTOMATION (23 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The twenty-first century is starting to build machines and systems
that don't need as many humans. Automation is a slow and uneven
pressure that makes jobs appear as well as disappear. Right now, the
good jobs at the center of the curve are thinning out, and junior
entry points are being quietly closed. Graduates are being told to
become outliers while competing with systems that learn from
everything they do.
