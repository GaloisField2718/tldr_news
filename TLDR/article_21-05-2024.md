 INSIDE MICROSOFT'S MISSION TO TAKE DOWN THE MACBOOK AIR (7 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Microsoft recently spent an entire day pitting its new hardware
against the MacBook Air. Its new Surface devices, equipped with
Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips, pulled ahead in tests against
Apple's category-leading laptop. Microsoft's Copilot Plus PCs feature
an improved emulator that can emulate apps twice as fast as the
previous generation of Windows on Arm devices. They are equipped with
a neural processing unit that can perform more AI task operations per
watt than the MacBook Air M3 and Nvidia's RTX 4060. Microsoft's
Copilot Plus PCs will hit the market this summer. 

 ELON MUSK'S NEURALINK GETS FDA GREEN LIGHT FOR SECOND PATIENT, AS
FIRST DESCRIBES HIS EMOTIONAL JOURNEY (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The US Food and Drug Administration has given the green light for
Neuralink to implant its brain chip in a second person. Most of the
threads implanted in the first participant have come loose and are no
longer reading the electrical signals needed to translate his thoughts
into cursor movements. While software changes have helped him regain
many of the device's capabilities, only around 15% of the threads
inserted in his brain remain in place. Neuralink's proposed fix for
the problem that occurred in the first test participant involves
embedding some of the device's ultrathin wires deeper into the brain.

 WE TAKE A STAB AT DECODING SPACEX'S EVER-CHANGING PLANS FOR STARSHIP
IN FLORIDA (21 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Federal Aviation Administration is kicking off a new
environmental review of SpaceX's plan to launch Starships from
Florida. The US Space Force is overseeing a similar Environmental
Impact Statement review for SpaceX's proposal to take over a launch
pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. While the reviews can take
a while and may delay SpaceX's plans, they show that SpaceX is finally
cementing its plans to launch Starship from Florida. 

 SINGLE BRAIN IMPLANT RESTORES BILINGUAL COMMUNICATION TO PARALYZED
MAN (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers found that the area of the brain where the intention to
speak gets translated into control over the vocal tract produces
consistent signals for both English and Spanish, allowing systems
trained on English phrases to improve on their recognition of Spanish.
The process of detecting these signals is complex, and it can result
in high error rates. Piping the output through a large language model
resulted in lower error rates. The study showed that the parts of the
brain that control the muscles needed to speak aren't picky about
which language they're handling.

reasons. The post covers what to include in a commit message and other
places to post messages. It also covers typography, but attempts to
keep the topic to a bare minimum.

 GOOGLE CEO SUNDAR PICHAI ON AI-POWERED SEARCH AND THE FUTURE OF THE
WEB (42 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article contains an interview with Google CEO Sundar Pichai
conducted the day after the Google I/O developer conference last week.
Google is building AI into virtually all of its products. The company
is currently rolling out AI Overviews in Search, a move that will
change the internet ecosystem as we know it. Pichai says that
injecting AI into Search is about creating value for users and that
users are clicking on links at higher rates in the AI previews. There
is a deep tension between Google's vision for the future and the very
real fears and anxieties creators and website owners are feeling about
how search has changed and how AI might change the internet forever. 

 TAKING RISK (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Startup founders in the US imagine the range of possible scenarios
and pitch the top one percent outcome. This approach matches what
venture Capitalists are looking for - it's an industry based on
outlier returns. While most investments will fail completely, some
will make a modest return, and a small percentage will be worth a
thousand times what was paid initially - these successes easily pay
for all of the other failures. The downside of early-stage investing
is losing 1x your money, but the upside is that you make 1,000x - this
is where you should focus your attention.
