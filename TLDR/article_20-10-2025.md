 IS YOUR TEAM BUILDING OR SCALING AI AGENTS? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 One of AI's biggest challenges today is MEMORY—how agents retain,
recall, and remember over time. Without it, even the best models
struggle with context loss, inconsistency, and limited scalability.

This new O'Reilly + Redis report [4] breaks down why memory is the
foundation of scalable AI systems and how real-time architectures make
it possible. 

Inside the report: 

 	* The role of short term, long term, and persistent memory in agent
performance
 	* Frameworks and tools like LangGraph, Mem0, and Redis
 	* Architectural patters for faster, more reliable, context-aware
systems 

Download the report to learn how memory is reshaping AI → [4]

 HOW SAM ALTMAN PLAYED HOLLYWOOD (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI made a series of calculated moves when it released Sora. The
app initially had an opt-out clause for people's likenesses to be used
in clips. This caused a flood of clips using copyrighted material to
be created. The company then quickly pivoted to an opt-in model. This
could cause legal trouble for OpenAI in the near future. 

 THE LITTLE-KNOWN CRYPTO POWERHOUSE BEHIND BILLIONS IN TRADING (11
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange with an automated trading
pool and token buybacks. It is a booming platform for perpetual
futures, the never-expiring contracts that dominate crypto
speculation. Run by a team of roughly 15 people based in Singapore,
the site's front end blocks US users, but anyone can trade on the
blockchain that powers it. Hyperliquid was designed with transparency
in mind - every trade, liquidation, and validator action is verifiable
in real time, and Hyperliquid never takes custody of user funds. Much
more about the two-year-old exchange is available in the article.

 WHY THE NEXT GENERATION OF MRNA VACCINES IS SET TO BE EVEN BETTER (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 mRNA vaccines that code for virus-like nanoparticles produce a strong
immune response while still being quick and cheap to make. Scientists
at the University of Washington have shown that an mRNA version of a
COVID-19 nanoparticle vaccine produces an immune response in mice that
is up to 28 times higher than that of a standard mRNA vaccine. The
more potent vaccine could lower side effects as patients receive lower
doses. Scientists are already working on mRNA-launched nanoparticle
vaccines for the flu, Epstein-Barr, and other viruses. 

 THE FIRST NON-OPIOID PAINKILLER (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Post-operative pain relief has relied on opioids since ancient times.
The FDA approved the first non-opioid pain reliever suitable for
treating post-surgery pain in January. Vertex Pharmaceuticals'
Journavx has known of the signs of the problematic side effects
associated with opioids. While the drug likely won't serve as an
outright opioid replacement, it is the first step on the journey to
minimizing opioid usage.

 [DATADOG EBOOK] 6 STEPS TO DIAGRAM YOUR CLOUD ARCHITECTURE (SPONSOR)
[9] 

 If you can't see how traffic moves, you can't truly calculate cost or
detect latency issues — especially if you use dozens of services. In
this eBook, Datadog & AWS Solutions Architects provide 6 steps to
diagramming your cloud architecture [9] at the infra and traffic
levels. Download your copy [9] 

 KNOWLEDGE CREATES TECHNICAL DEBT (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Technical debt is essentially a pile of knowledge. Everything 'bad'
about the code represents what has been learned about how to do
software better. Fixing that code isn't a 'debt to pay off', but an
investment opportunity that will reap rewards. Skipping the
opportunity to fix code is wasting the investment previously made in
learning, and this could lead to a loss in revenue as competitors make
the most of their knowledge. 

 OPEN SOURCE IS THE MOST FRAGILE AND MOST RESILIENT ECOSYSTEM (16
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Open source powers the internet. If it stopped being maintained by
benevolent people, things would break. Companies fail, but open source
is immortal. Open source will never fail to adapt to new markets
because someone will force it to adapt either by contributing to it or
forking it. Open source's fragility demands collective action to
ensure its resilience.

 HOW TO SEQUENCE YOUR DNA FOR <$2K (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The first human genome took $2.3 billion and 13 years to sequence. It
now takes an Oxford Nanopore to sequence whatever DNA you want in less
than 48 hours. The machine uses electrical nanopores to read the
individual charge of each DNA base pair. It costs $1,000, making it
possible to sequence your own DNA at home for around $1,100. Using the
machine can help people avoid giving their DNA to companies and
risking it being lost in a data breach. 

 RESEARCH RESULTS ARE CULTURAL ARTIFACTS, NOT PUBLIC GOODS (2 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Knowledge and scientific progress are very much private goods. It's
all about specific people and how they think. Cultural artifacts can
and will spread, but there's nothing free about it, and it won't
spread equally everywhere. The view that scientific research is a
public good is a naive and indefensible view.
