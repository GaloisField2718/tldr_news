originally scheduled for December 18 but was delayed due to cold

 NASA recently shared a video detailing its plan to launch a
commercial delivery service to the moon. It is currently working with
14 companies to deliver science and technology to the lunar surface.
NASA has a long-term plan to build a permanent moon base. A commercial
delivery service to the moon would radically increase the amount of
science that can be achieved. It could pave the way for a similar
service to other destinations like Mars.

 TECHNICAL DEBT IS NOT REAL (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Technical debt is a metaphor about the accumulated consequences of
past decisions and shortcuts. This article examines this metaphor to
see how technical debt has less to do with code and more to do with
the choices and compromises that emerge from the challenges within
software development. It looks at emergent technical debt, which
arises from evolving system requirements, and deliberate technical
debt, a strategic choice to prioritize rapid development over code
quality. The article aims to refine understanding of technical debt
and identify effective strategies for managing it.

 THE ROAD AHEAD REACHES A TURNING POINT IN 2024 (35 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 2023 signaled the start of a new era and 2023 is an opportunity to
shape the world's next chapter for the better. The year gave us a

 SSH PROTECTS THE WORLD‚ÄôS MOST SENSITIVE NETWORKS. IT JUST GOT A LOT
WEAKER (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Researchers have devised an attack with the potential to undermine
cryptographic SSH protections. Terrapin is a man-in-the-middle attack
that affects SSH connections secured by ChaCha20-Poly1305 or CBC with
Encrypt-then-MAC. Around 57% of servers list these encryption modes as
their preferred choice. Anyone using SSH should check whether they are
vulnerable to the attack and make the appropriate updates. The attack
invalidates proofs published in 2016 concluding that such attacks
weren't possible. Details about the attack and how it works are
available in the article.
