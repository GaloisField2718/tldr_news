BIG TECH & STARTUPS

 ILYA SUTSKEVER, OPENAI'S FORMER CHIEF SCIENTIST, LAUNCHES NEW AI
COMPANY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ilya Sutskever, one of OpenAI's co-founders and former chief
scientist, has launched a new company just a month after formally
leaving OpenAI. Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI) has only one goal
and one product: a safe superintelligence. Sutskever has previously
predicted that AI with intelligence superior to humans could arrive
within the decade, and that when it does, it won't necessarily be
benevolent. This necessitates research into ways to control and
restrict it. SSI has been designed from the ground up as a for-profit
entity. It is currently recruiting technical talent in Palo Alto and
Tel Aviv. 

 NETFLIX TO OPEN MASSIVE ENTERTAINMENT, DINING, AND SHOPPING COMPLEXES
IN TWO CITIES IN 2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Netflix plans to open two new in-person experience venues in 2025.
The locations, which will be in King of Prussia, Pa., and Dallas, will
feature a wide array of shopping outlets, eateries, and activities
tied to major franchises. The two new Netflix Houses will have
footprints spanning more than 100,000 square feet. Netflix doesn't see
these permanent retail destinations as becoming a sizable new business
segment - it is aiming for them to serve as marketing vehicles that
invite fan engagement to support the core subscription-streaming
business.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE FRAMEWORK LAPTOP 13 IS ABOUT TO BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST
RISC-V LAPTOPS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Framework has partnered with DeepComputing, the company behind the
very first RISC-V laptops, to build a RISC-V mainboard for the
Framework Laptop 13. While the performance and features of these chips
aren't on par with Intel or AMD (a Raspberry Pi 4 is likely faster),
the integration is exciting as RISC-V is becoming more accessible.
Framework hasn't announced a release date or price yet as the RISC-V
mainboard is still in early development. 

 FOR EVS, SEMI-SOLID-STATE BATTERIES OFFER A STEP FORWARD (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 It's not yet realistic to look for solid-state batteries in
production vehicles anytime soon. Semi-solid-state batteries with gel
electrolytes still offer significant improvement over lithium iron
phosphate batteries. They can be made on conventional lithium-ion
battery production lines. Several companies are actively developing
semi-solid-state batteries - WeLion, a Chinese company, has created a
battery pack that delivers more than 1,000 kilometers of driving range
on a single charge.

 AS YOU READ THIS, DATA BROKERS ARE SELLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO
SCAMMERS (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Do you get a lot of suspicious texts, calls, and emails?

That's because data brokers sell our contact details, DOBs, SSNs, and
more, to the highest bidders - every day. The good news? Incogni [10]
confronts brokers on your behalf, preventing bad actors from accessing
your data.

 WHY DOES SQLITE (IN PRODUCTION) HAVE SUCH A BAD REP? (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 SQLite, like any other database, has its pros and cons. It's perfect
for the majority of applications and scales, and developers can always
use PostgreSQL for anything else. Many of the problems SQLite
previously had have been fixed. One of the issues with SQLite is that
it doesn't allow multiple concurrent writers, but this may not be
necessary for all workloads. 

 ASK HN: WHY DO MESSAGE QUEUE-BASED ARCHITECTURES SEEM LESS POPULAR
NOW? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [12] 

 There was a lot of hype around building distributed systems using
message queues in the late 2000s and early 2010s. That hype seems to
have disappeared. One of the reasons for this is because most
companies have realized that they're too small for these 'scalability
tricks'. Bigger single machines being available for more reasonable
prices means that companies are fine running on less hardware. Most
companies are better off building well-componentized monoliths that
they can break off into independent services later if there's a reason
to do so.

 INTERNAL SPACEX DOCUMENTS SHOW THE SWEET STOCK DEALS OFFERED TO
INVESTORS LIKE A16Z, GIGAFUND (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SpaceX allows its employees to cash out some of their shares by
selling to company-authorized outside investors around every 6 months.
This article discusses an internal document from SpaceX about such a
tender offer from 2022. Investors paid $70 per share to employees in
the offer, an enormous discount compared to the $270 per share during
the primary sale that year. The main reason for the price discrepancy
comes from employees owning common stock - investors who buy into
primary rounds typically buy preferred stock, which entitles them to
dividends and liquidation preferences. 

 I'M THE HACKER THAT BROUGHT DOWN NORTH KOREA'S INTERNET FOR OVER A
WEEK. AMA (REDDIT THREAD) [14] 

 Alejandro Caceres, a 38-year-old Colombian-American cybersecurity
entrepreneur, wrote a set of programs that kept every publicly visible
website in North Korea offline for more than a week in late 2022.
Caceres had been personally targeted by North Korean spies who tried
to steal his intrusion tools, but had received no real governmental
support despite detailing the targeting to the FBI, so he decided to
take matters into his own hands. He was adopted informally by a
Pentagon contractor and invited to present his techniques to
high-level US defense and intelligence officials following his North
Korean cyberattacks.
