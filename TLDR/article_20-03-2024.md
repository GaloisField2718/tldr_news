 META JUST SHOWED OFF THREADS‚Äô FEDIVERSE INTEGRATION FOR THE VERY
FIRST TIME (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta showed off a brief demo of how users will eventually be able to
connect their accounts to the fediverse during the FediForum
conference on Tuesday. The company's integration will let users share
their posts across different platforms through Threads. It currently
allows users to post to other services that interoperate through
ActivityPub, but they can't view replies and can only see the likes
they get, a fact Meta is working hard to change. A video showing how
the integration currently works is available in the article.

 IS THE ‚ÄúAI DEVELOPER‚Äù A THREAT TO JOBS ‚Äì OR A MARKETING STUNT?
(12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 There have been a number of news stories about AI developers
recently. While some developers are concerned that the technology may
soon take over their jobs, these claims are likely just attempts at
grabbing attention. AI may not remove the need for developers - it
will likely just create the need for AI developers. The future of
software development will likely still involve humans - the
exaggerated claims made by startups today are just marketing.

 HOW TO START GOOGLE (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Building a company is not a trick for avoiding work, but it avoids
many of the annoying things that come with a job. You need three
things to build a successful startup: technology skills, an idea, and
cofounders. This article talks about how to get all three. Making
things for friends is a great source of ideas for young founders, who
have the least amount of knowledge about what other people want and
whose own wants are most predictive of future demand.
