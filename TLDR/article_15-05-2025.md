 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and helps them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 MEET ALPHAEVOLVE, THE GOOGLE AI THAT WRITES ITS OWN CODE—AND JUST
SAVED MILLIONS IN COMPUTING COSTS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve is an artificial intelligence agent
that can invent brand-new computer algorithms. It pairs Google's large
language models with an approach that tests, refines, and improves
algorithms automatically. The system has already been deployed across
Google's data centers, chip designs, and AI training systems, boosting
efficiency and solving mathematical problems that have stumped
researchers for decades. The system represents a major leap in AI's
ability to develop sophisticated algorithms for both scientific
challenges and everyday computing problems. 

 UBER'S NEW BUS-LIKE FEATURE FOR COMMUTERS IS NEARLY 50 PERCENT
CHEAPER THAN UBERX (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Uber's new type of ride service travels along a set route every 20
minutes with up to three passengers. Route Share will cost up to 50%
less than an UberX ride. The service will be available in select
cities and only during commuting hours. Uber says the service is a
complement to public transit. The company has also announced a new
price lock feature that allows customers to lock in a certain price
for up to 10 routes for a $2.99 per month fee. Customers can now
prepay for up to 20 rides a month at a reduced rate.

 BIG TUNNELING MILESTONE! (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Boring Company has successfully continuously mined in a
Zero-People-in-Tunnel (ZPIT) configuration. Its machine can
simultaneously advance forward and build tunnels without a human in
it. Each 'ring' in the tunnel weighs around 24,000 pounds. ZPIT
continuous mining is the Holy Grail for Boring Machines as it is the
safest, fastest, and least expensive architecture for building
tunnels. 

 ROBOT CHEFS TAKE OVER AT SOUTH KOREA'S HIGHWAY RESTAURANTS, TO MIXED
REVIEWS (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 South Korean tech companies are now deploying collaborative robots to
work alongside humans in hotels, elder care, schools, and restaurants.
The bots are supposed to solve a looming labor shortage in the rapidly
aging nation. The government plans to increase the number of bot
workers to 1 million by 2030. The reaction to the introduction of
robots has been met with mixed emotions from both workers and
customers.

 MICROSOFT PULLS PLUG ON BING SEARCH APIS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Microsoft will retire Bing Search APIs on August 11. All existing
instances of Bing Search APIs will be decommissioned completely and
the API will no longer be available for use. Developers who need a
real alternative are recommended to check out Brave Search APIs, which
generally offers a more cost-effective solution, especially for
developers with lower usage needs. 

 GIT-BUG (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 git-bug is an issue management tool that embeds issues, comments, and
more as objects in a git repository, enabling users to push and pull
them to one or more remotes. It manages issues, users, and comments
directly within repositories, keeping everything versioned and
clutter-free. git-bug leverages git's decentralized architecture to
work offline and sync seamlessly later. It is lightning fast and
easily synchronizes with platforms like GitHub and GitLab.

 IF YOU HATE ADS ON NETFLIX, I HAVE BAD NEWS: THEY'RE DOING REALLY
WELL (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Netflix's ad-supported tier has 94 million monthly active users, up
20 million since last November. The cheaper plan costs $7.99 per month
compared to $17.99 for the lowest ad-free option. The ad model is
outperforming expectations. Netflix says its ad-supported tier now
reaches more US viewers aged 18 to 34 than any other broadcast or
cable network and that viewers are engaging with mid-roll ads just as
much as they do with the content itself. 

 LLMS ARE MAKING ME DUMBER (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Large language models can help people output substantially more work,
but this usually comes at the cost of learning or improvement. People
are incentivized to maximize immediate output, so the sacrifice seems
fair. Before the rise of generative AI, learning was a prerequisite
for output, but people can now use technology to build things without
deeply understanding the implementation. Developers should decide what
skills they are and are not okay with offloading and what they want to
do for themselves.
