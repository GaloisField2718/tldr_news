 SPACEX'S GIANT MARS ROCKET COMPLETES NEARLY FLAWLESS TEST FLIGHT (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SpaceX's Starship made it all the way up to space and back down to
Earth during its 10th test flight. The test appeared to achieve all of
SpaceX's test objectives and puts SpaceX back on track after several
failed attempts. Some problems did occur during the tests, including
the shutdown of one of the booster's 33 engines, the rear flaps used
for controlling the vehicle being partially burned through, and the
explosion of a part of the aft portion of the spacecraft. Elon Musk
recently said that SpaceX's goal of launching the first Starships to
Mars (without any people aboard) by 2026 is still achievable. 

 GOOGLE IMPROVES GEMINI AI IMAGE EDITING WITH “NANO BANANA” MODEL
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nano banana is a model from Google DeepMind that allows users to
modify images with prompts. The model has unrivaled consistency across
edits as it can remember details. It can also merge multiple images,
combining them to generate new scenes. The new image editing abilities
are now available in the Gemini app. The model will roll out soon in
the Gemini API, AI Studio, and Vertex AI for developers.

 CHINA'S GUOWANG MEGACONSTELLATION IS MORE THAN ANOTHER VERSION OF
STARLINK (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There's mounting evidence that China's Guowang megaconstellation may
give Chinese military forces a tactical edge in any future armed
conflict in the Western Pacific. The megaconstellation is managed by a
secretive company called China SatNet, established by the Chinese
government in 2021. The network consists of satellites manufactured by
multiple companies launched on several types of rockets. The launch
pace of Guowang satellites has approached that of Starlink's in recent
weeks. Guowang's satellites have higher altitude limits than Starlink
satellites, so fewer units are required for global coverage. 

 A PILL TO FIGHT OBESITY IS ON THE VERGE OF APPROVAL (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Eli Lilly has just released positive Phase III trial results for its
experimental oral GLP-1 drug, orforglipron. People taking the drug
experienced substantial improvements in weight loss and blood sugar
control compared to those taking a placebo. It appeared to be as safe
and tolerable as other existing GLP-1 drugs. The company now plans to
apply for approval from the Food and Drug Administration, with a
decision expected next year.

 RV, A NEW KIND OF RUBY MANAGEMENT TOOL (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 rv is a dependency manager for Ruby written in Rust. It manages both
Ruby versions and gems at once, so developers can run whatever they
want to run without having to worry about the environment being
correct. rv brings all the tricks and innovations of cargo, npm, and
uv into a tool for Ruby. It can currently auto-switch between
installed Ruby versions in zsh and install precompiled Ruby 3.4.x on
macOS and Ubuntu in one second flat. 

 CONVENIENT 'COPY AS CURL': EXPLICIT, EXECUTABLE, EDITABLE REQUEST
REPLAYS (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The network tab of a browser's developer tools shows a list of
requests. The dev tools UI provides a 'Copy as cURL' functionality for
users to extract an executable 'replay' of the request that can be
easily edited. This makes communicating and debugging issues with HTTP
requests much easier. Just be careful about sharing any data that
might have confidential information in it, like authentication tokens
or session cookies.

 REPORTS OF AI NOT PROGRESSING OR OFFERING MUNDANE UTILITY ARE OFTEN
GREATLY EXAGGERATED (26 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There have been many claims that AI isn't progressing or that it
won't create much value due to the results of a recent study. It is
still early days - companies have only really had enough time to look
for ways to integrate AI into existing structures. The timeline to the
largest visible-in-GDP gains will take a while to show up. Future AIs
will not abide by current standard economic rules. 

 THERE IS NOW CLEARER EVIDENCE AI IS WRECKING YOUNG AMERICANS' JOB
PROSPECTS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 New research by Stanford University economists shows that AI is
profoundly limiting some young Americans' employment prospects. Fields
where generative AI tools can most easily automate tasks, such as
software development, are being affected the most. However, employment
in fields where AI can help people in their work rather than replace
them is improving. More about the study, which has yet to be peer
reviewed or published, is available in the article.
