 HOW FILE TRANSFER AUTOMATION SUPPORTS SECURITY IN AN AGE OF
UNSTOPPABLE DATA GROWTH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 How do businesses share data and knowledge? Many are still reliant on
homegrown solutions—untidy collections of manual operations, scripts
and unofficial FTP clients—to transmit even their most sensitive
files.

This whitepaper by TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group [4] looks at
the role of managed file transfer (MFT) in an organization's data
management and migration strategy: enabling secure and efficient
information sharing within the organization or between multiple
organizations.

Based on original research and analysis [4], the report will help you
understand the MFT software market, the challenges it addresses and
the key players.

 ANTHROPIC PUBLICLY RELEASES AI TOOL THAT CAN TAKE OVER THE USER'S
MOUSE CURSOR (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic's new Computer Use tool can take control of users' mouse
cursors and perform basic tasks on their computers. It is now
available exclusively with Anthropic's mid-range 3.5 Sonnet model via
the API. It works by taking rapid successive screengrabs, so it can
miss short-lived notifications and other changes and is incapable of
some common actions like drag-and-drop. The tool is still cumbersome
and error-prone at times. A video from Anthropic explaining the tool
is available in the article. 

 APPLE WORKING ON NEW APP STORE-LIKE APP DEDICATED TO GAMES (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Apple is reportedly working on a new App Store-like app dedicated to
games that combines functionality from the App Store and Game Center
in one place. It is not expected to replace Game Center, but will
integrate with users' Game Center profiles. The app will allow users
to find and play games and show things like challenges, leaderboards,
and achievements. It will be used to promote special gaming events and
information about important updates. Apple is experimenting with some
kind of integration with FaceTime and iMessage on the app.

 DE-EXTINCTION COMPANY PROVIDES A PROGRESS REPORT ON THYLACINE EFFORTS
(5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Colossal, a company founded to try to restore the mammoth to the
Arctic tundra, released a progress report last week on the work
involved in resurrecting the thylacine, which went extinct in 1936.
Marsupial biology has features that may make de-extinction somewhat
easier, and it appears that the technology available for working with
marsupials is expanding rapidly. Colossal has a nearly complete genome
sequence from a thylacine sample and it expects to complete the genome
shortly. It is working on technology that will allow marsupial embryos
to develop inside artificial uteruses. 

 WORLD'S 1ST DONOR CELL THERAPY HELPS 3 AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER PATIENTS
IN CHINA (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Three Chinese patients received treatment for autoimmune disorders
using engineered immune cells made from donor cells. All three
recipients reported improvements to their conditions. The treatment
involved genetically engineering healthy-donor-derived CD19-targeting
CAR-T cells using CRISPR-Cas9 to address issues with immune rejection.
The study demonstrates the high safety and promising immune modularity
effect of off-the-shelf CAR-T cells in treating severe refractory
autoimmune diseases.

 HOW WE BUILT A NEW POWERFUL JSON DATA TYPE FOR CLICKHOUSE (23 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 JSON has become the go-to format for handling semi-structured and
unstructured data in modern data systems. While it seems simple,
leveraging the format effectively at scale presents unique challenges.
This article explains some of the challenges ClickHouse, one of the
fastest analytical databases on the market, experienced in
implementing JSON support. It outlines how ClickHouse developed a new
JSON type from scratch designed to address the limitations and improve
the overall functionality of the now deprecated Object('json') data
type. 

 SVELTE 5 IS ALIVE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Svelte 5 is finally stable after almost 18 months of development. It
is the most significant release in the project's history. Svelte 5 is
a ground-up rewrite, which means that apps will be faster, smaller,
and more reliable. It allows developers to write more consistent and
idiomatic code and there's less stuff to learn for newcomers. Svelte 5
is almost completely compatible with Svelte 4 and the initial upgrade
will be completely seamless for the majority of users.

 NVIDIA COMPUTER FINDS LARGEST KNOWN PRIME, BLOWS PAST RECORD BY 16
MILLION DIGITS (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Luke Durant, a researcher, former Nvidia employee, and the most
prolific contributor to the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search
(GIMPS), has discovered a new largest known prime number. Short-handed
as M136279841, the number can be calculated by multiplying two
together 136,279,841 times and then subtracting one. GIMPS has
discovered the last 18 Mersenne primes. Durant used a supercomputer
comprising thousands of GPUs in 17 different countries to find the
number. 

 LEARNING TO LEARN (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 When you're starting something new, the most important thing is
knowing what to learn. The optimal learning flow involves very quickly
identifying what the foundational knowledge is, building a personal
curriculum to become an expert, and sprinting hard in the first hours
to impress initial memory, then decelerating to a more regular place.
Knowing how to learn is an extremely high-leverage skill. Being
productively honest is one of the most effective and kindest things
you can do for yourself.
