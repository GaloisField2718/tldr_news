and functional mushrooms that's low on caffeine and big on
[4]benefits. You get focus, natural energy, and immune support,
without the jitters, crash or dependency you get from too much coffee.

 SAM ALTMAN REJOINS OPENAI BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS INVESTIGATION INTO
HIS OUSTER COMES TO A CLOSE (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has announced its new board with the wrap-up of an internal
investigation into the events leading to Sam Altman's ouster. Sam
Altman will rejoin OpenAI's board along with Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann,
former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Nicole Seligman,
former EVP and Global General Counsel of Sony and President of Sony
Entertainment; Fidji Simo, CEO and Chair of Instacart; and current
board members Adam D‚ÄôAngelo, Larry Summers, and Bret Taylor. OpenAI
will continue to expand the board moving forward. 

 FORMER ACTIVISION CEO BOBBY KOTICK CONSIDERING BUYING TIKTOK (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick is considering buying TikTok - he
recently floated the idea at a dinner with a group of potential
partners. A proposed legislation may force ByteDance to sell TikTok or
have it banned from the US. There are concerns that ByteDance may
share data about its users with the Chinese government or use the
platform to influence US citizens' political opinions. The bill will
be voted on by the full House on Wednesday, after which it will move
on to the Senate.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 MRNA VACCINES: LET'S BE SICK A WHOLE LOT LESS AND MAYBE CURE CANCER
(19 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 mRNA vaccines are our best bet at addressing viral persistence. They
can prevent infection as well as improve responses against infection.
They are also faster, cheaper, and more flexible to make than their
traditional counterparts. mRNA vaccines are like injectable
instructions that turn a body's cells into factories that can create
any protein for which mRNA instructions can be built. This means they
can be used to teach the body to mount an immune response to any
target foreign protein - including proteins on cancer cells. 

 NEW BREAKTHROUGH BRINGS MATRIX MULTIPLICATION CLOSER TO IDEAL (11
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Three researchers from the University of California have presented a
new technique that boosts matrix multiplication. Matrix multiplication
is a fundamental computational operation that is incorporated into a
large population of the algorithms people use every day for a variety
of tasks. Even slight improvements can eventually lead to significant
savings in time, computational power, and money. While the new
technique has set new records, the most exciting thing about the
development is that the technique reveals a new avenue for improvement
that was previously unknown.

 S3 IS FILES, BUT NOT A FILESYSTEM (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The idea that Amazon S3 is really an 'Amazon Cloud Filesystem' is a
bit of a fiction - it isn't a file system and it can't stand in for
one. S3 implements a completely different arrangement and its
primitives are only partly compatible with the Unix file API. It has
fewer functions and can't do some tasks, such as overwriting files
partially. This means that filesystem software, especially databases,
can't be ported to Amazon S3. 

 HOW WE BYPASSED SAFARI 17'S ADVANCED AUDIO FINGERPRINTING PROTECTION
(22 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Browsers can produce audio files that users can't hear. These audio
files can be used to identify web visitors. Apple has decided to fight
this type of identification in Safari 17, but so far its measures
don't fully work. The new measures can be bypassed using a technique
detailed in this article. A link to a post that explains how audio
fingerprinting works is available.

 HERE IS CLAUDE 3'S SYSTEM PROMPT (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This X post contains a screenshot of Claude 3's system prompt.
According to the prompt, Claude's knowledge base was last updated in
August 2023. It is instructed to give concise responses to simple
questions but provide thorough responses to more complex and
open-ended questions. The bot is told to answer questions without
engaging in stereotyping. Claude will not mention information about
itself unless the information is directly pertinent to the query. 

 HIGH AGENCY (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 People are able to render anything in the world. They just have to be
audacious enough and ambitious enough to envision a different reality.
Couple this with the ability to inspire others, and you can become a
force of nature. AGI makes raw skill less important, but it will still
take hard work and unwavering commitment to make a profound impact in
people's lives.
