 RESPONSIBILITY OVER FREEDOM: HOW NETFLIX'S CULTURE HAS CHANGED (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 While Netflix doesn't release a lot of its numbers to the outside
world, the streaming giant has long been aggressively transparent
internally. Netflix trusts its employees to act in the best interest
of the company. Employees are encouraged to speak about what's going
well and what's not on a regular basis. Netflix has a culture of
trying to systematically think about what generates long-term
excellence. Many more details about Netflix's internal culture are
available in the article. 

 APPLE IS FIRST COMPANY CHARGED WITH VIOLATING EU'S DMA RULES (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The European Commission has opened an investigation into Apple's
support for alternative iOS marketplaces in Europe. The investigation
is focused on Apple's Core Technology Fee, the multistep process
required for users to install third-party marketplaces, and Apple's
eligibility requirements for developers. Regulators say that Apple's
App Store 'steering' policies violate the EU's Digital Markets Act
(DMA). Apple is the first company to be charged under the DMA rules -
it can respond to the European Conformation's preliminary assessment
ahead of its final ruling before March 2025. Apple could be fined up
to 10% of its annual global revenue for infringement.

 WORLD FIRST EPILEPSY DEVICE FITTED IN UK BOY'S SKULL (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A boy in the UK received a neurostimulator device in his skull to
control seizures. The device has reduced his daytime seizures by 80%.
The patient has a treatment-resistant form of epilepsy that sometimes
causes him to suffer hundreds of seizures every day. He suffers a
range of seizures, some of which require emergency medication to
resuscitate him. The device, which can be recharged wirelessly, emits
a constant pulse of current that aims to block or disrupt abnormal
signals. While the device is not a cure, it has improved the patient's
life significantly.

(5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Singapore is the only country where cultivated meat can be purchased
in shops. The country aims to produce 30% of its nutritional needs
locally by 2030. Its approval of cultivated meat has attracted
companies from all over the world to develop alternative proteins. Its
regulatory structure makes it the perfect spot for companies to
further the technology and help drive down costs.

 OPTIMIZING AI INFERENCE AT CHARACTER.AI (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Making a future where large language models enhance daily life,
provide business productivity and entertainment, and help people with
everything requires highly efficient inference. Character.AI designs
its model architecture, inference stack, and product from the ground
up to enable unique opportunities to optimize inference to be more
efficient, cost-effective, and scalable. The company serves more than
20,000 inference queries per second. It is able to sustainably serve
models at this scale because it has developed a number of key
innovations across its serving stack. This blog post shares some of
the techniques and optimizations Character.AI has developed. 

 WHAT ARE SOME CUSTOM TOOLS YOU'VE BUILT/SEEN INTERNALLY THAT HAS
HELPED YOUR TEAM SUCCEED IN AUTOMATION? (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This page contains several anecdotes from developers on custom tools
they either built or witnessed internally that helped teams succeed in
automation. The examples include a test execution tool that performed
230 tests in 3 hours, a script that writes hundreds of tests for a
single service then extracts all the variables and displays their data
types and formats, a visual regression tool, and a notification
system. Links to communities where people discuss software testing and
automation are available.

 THE FUTURE OF STREAMING (28 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Stocks of legacy media companies are at a fraction of their former
highs, while shares of their disruptors are close to record highs.
Netflix commands the leading territory right now and is essentially in
a position of dictating policy. Streaming services need at least 200
million subscribers, possibly more, before becoming competitive and
profitable. The cost of attracting and keeping those millions of
customers isn't cheap - Netflix will spend about $17 billion this year
on programming. Almost no other competitor will be able to match that
spending level, except maybe Amazon.
