 🚀 FASTER MOBILE APP RELEASES WITH 100% PARALLEL AUTOMATED QA
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf [5] gets mobile apps to 80% automated test coverage in weeks
[6]. They create and maintain your test suite in Appium (no vendor
lock-in) — and provide unlimited, 100% parallel test runs [5] with
zero flakes.

✅ QA cycles reduced from hours to less than 15 minutes

✅ Tests run on real iOS devices and Android emulators

✅ Flake-free runs, no false positives

✅ Human-verified bug reports

No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No more bugs
reaching production.

 AWS SERVICES RECOVER AFTER DAYLONG OUTAGE HITS MAJOR SITES (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Amazon Web Services experienced a major outage yesterday that took
down numerous websites. Many sites came back online within a few
hours. All AWS services returned to normal operations shortly after 6
PM ET. The outage was first reported at 3:11 AM ET. The AWS status
page said it was a DNS issue with DynamoDB, a database service that
underpins many AWS applications. 

 HOW SAM ALTMAN TIED TECH'S BIGGEST PLAYERS TO OPENAI (16 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman went on a dealmaking blitz to achieve his
vision of securing seemingly endless computing power for his company.
He played the egos of Silicon Valley's giants, resulting in a game of
financial one-upmanship that has tied the fates of the world's biggest
semiconductor and cloud companies to OpenAI. Vast swaths of the US
economy are now betting on the success of a startup that is nowhere
near turning a profit and facing a mounting list of business
challenges. Investors don't seem to be bothered, as the stock prices
of companies that have made deals with OpenAI have soared.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 VISION RESTORED USING PROSTHETIC RETINAL IMPLANT (5 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Researchers have restored some vision to people with a loss of
retinal photoreceptors using a prosthetic retinal implant. The vision
restored is black and white, blurry, and has a small field of view.
The implant receives signals from glasses and a camera that projects
infrared images to the artificial retina. Most patients do not see
better immediately - they need months of training. The researchers are
in talks with the FDA about selling the device in the US. 

 THE NEXT REVOLUTION IN BIOLOGY ISN'T READING LIFE'S CODE — IT'S
WRITING IT (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Genome writing is humanity's next great moonshot. The Human Genome
Project-write (HGP-write) and SynHG, the Synthetic Human Genome
Initiative, aim to develop the technology to write DNA. DNA synthesis
could transform biology, medicine, and industry. Global cooperation
would ensure that the technology is used wisely and for the common
good.

 CLAUDE CODE IS UNREASONABLY GOOD AT BUILDING MVPS (4 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Concerns about technical debt and quality are premature in the
prototyping and validation stage. Perfect code isn't required to
validate whether people want your product. What is needed is the
ability to test more ideas quickly. Claude Code allows people to
validate through building and testing. The ideas that survive contact
with actual users are the ones worth refactoring, hardening, and
scaling. 

 FRONT-END MAXIMALISM (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Just considering a front-end maximalist approach can lead to better
designs. Doing almost everything on the front end is underrated and
increasingly viable. Don't divide responsibilities between the front
and back end just out of habit. It is possible to get all the
modularity you need by structuring your code appropriately.

 WITH SPACEX BEHIND SCHEDULE, NASA WILL SEEK MORE MOON LANDER IDEAS (9
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 NASA is looking for a Plan B to carry astronauts to the Moon's
surface because SpaceX is behind schedule. It is opening bidding on a
contract to build a new lunar lander. The agency wants to beat China,
which is aiming to send astronauts to the Moon by 2030. President
Trump wants the moon landing to occur before the end of his term.
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk responded dismissively to the news, saying that
SpaceX is moving at a lightning pace compared to the rest of the
industry and that Starship will end up doing the whole Moon mission. 

 LETTER TO A YOUNG PERSON WORRYING ABOUT AI (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 It is possible to act without prediction. Most good businesspeople
don't attempt to predict the future. They instead design their lives
and organizations for fast adaptation under uncertainty. You can
safely ignore any essay that attempts to predict the future. Just look
at what is happening right now - you'll have plenty of time to adapt.
