 GAME EMULATORS ARRIVE IN APP STORE FOLLOWING RULE CHANGES (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 A recent change to Apple's App Store Review Guidelines means that a
rule that effectively banned the submission of console and classic
game emulators for iOS and iPadOS has been reversed. The first wave of
game emulators have now made their way to the App Store. Emu64 XL is a
Commodore 64 emulator and iGBA is a Gameboy Advance and Gameboy Color
emulator. Both are free to download without any in-app purchases.
Under Apple's rule changes, emulators still have to filter
objectionable content, follow all privacy guidelines, and not share
data or privacy permissions with other software, but it is unclear how
some of the rules will be enforced. 

 TESLA SLASHES FULL SELF-DRIVING MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION TO $99 (2 MINUTE
READ) [5]

 STARTUP LOOKING TO LAUNCH STADIUM-SIZED SPACE HABITATS ON SPACEX (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Max Space wants to launch expandable stadium-sized habitats into
Earth's orbit by the end of the decade. It has designed habitats that
minimize the mass and volume of the payload required to be launched
into space, providing people with room to live both in space and on
other planets or moons. The company plans to launch the scalable
habitats on SpaceX's rockets in 2027 and 2030. It will launch its
first off-Earth test in two years. 

 HOW NEW TECH IS MAKING GEOTHERMAL ENERGY A MORE VERSATILE POWER
SOURCE (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Project Red is a facility that uses geothermal energy to power a
local power grid in Nevada. The facility pumps water thousands of feet
into the ground, where it is heated by the Earth's super-hot core, and
then sucks the heated water back up to power generators. It leverages
techniques from the oil and gas industry to improve reliability and
cost-efficiency and make geothermal power possible in many more
locations. This article looks at how the facility works and the field
of geothermal energy in general, including other projects and attempts
at building the technology.

 LESSONS AFTER A HALF-BILLION GPT TOKENS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article contains seven lessons learned by Truss, a startup that
released a few LLM-heavy features over the last six months, that cover
how to improve prompting, tooling and optimal usage, GPT's
limitations, and more. The startup exclusively deals with text using a
combination of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. While GPT is useful, the technology
is still in its early days and probably won't result in everyone
losing their jobs. It mostly lowers the barrier of entry to ML/AI that
was previously only available to Google. 

 POSTGRESQL INDEX ADVISOR (GITHUB REPO) [10]

 TRANSCRIPT: EZRA KLEIN INTERVIEWS DARIO AMODEI (3 HOUR READ) [11] 

 Exponential growth can get out of control really quickly. The scaling
law hypothesis says that AI systems are on a growth curve where their
capabilities will continually grow exponentially as long as we keep
feeding in more data and computing power. This interview with Dario
Amodei, who led the team at OpenAI that created GPT-2 and GPT-3 before
leaving OpenAI to co-found Anthropic where he is now CEO, discusses
growth in AI, how AI is being adopted by society, the amount of energy
the technology consumes and how to mitigate its effects on the planet,
and much more. 

 ASK HN: DOES IT STILL MATTER TO BE IN THE BAY AREA? (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [12] 

 The new AI craze may have some people considering moving to the Bay
Area. The Bay Area is a place with a lot of knowledge and a culture
around risk that can be valuable for founders and people who want to
work in tech. While people can still find these things elsewhere, the
network of companies, developers, and investors is unparalleled.
People's opportunities for job search, networking, and career growth
are significantly higher by being where the ecosystem is concentrated.
