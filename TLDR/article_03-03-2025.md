 APPLE'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE EFFORTS REACH A MAKE-OR-BREAK POINT
(22 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's AI division now believes that a true modernized
conversational version of Siri won't reach consumers until iOS 20 at
best in 2027. iOS 19 will likely not include any significant
consumer-facing changes to Apple Intelligence because the company is
still working on getting the features announced last year out the
door. The company is currently not moving fast enough internally to
create the underlying AI technology that it needs to keep up with the
competition, suggesting that change is required. 

 WITH ALEXA PLUS, AMAZON FINALLY REINVENTS ITS BEST PRODUCT (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Amazon usually announces dozens of new gadgets at its event, but it
spent 70 minutes at its press conference last week instead talking
about Alexa Plus, its new generative AI-powered Alexa voice assistant.
The company has focused on building cheap hardware for Alexa over the
past decade and wasting efforts on failed ways for people to interact
with the assistant rather than improving the core technology. The new
Alexa was 100% rearchitected and is far more capable than its
predecessor - which will remain accessible. It can order food, control
smart home devices, create natural language security reports and
menus, and much more.

 ALPHABET'S TAARA CHIP USES LIGHT BEAMS TO PROVIDE HIGH-SPEED INTERNET
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Alphabet's Taara chip could lead to low-cost, high-speed internet
connectivity even in distant locations. It is about the size of a
fingernail and works by using a very narrow, invisible light beam to
transmit data at speeds as high as 20 gigabits per second at distances
of up to 20 kilometers. The technology works similarly to traditional
fiber except the light doesn't travel through cables. It only takes
days to install instead of the months or years it takes to lay down
fiber. The chip is expected to become available in 2026. 

 "WE'RE ON THE MOON": PRIVATE BLUE GHOST SPACECRAFT MAKES A HISTORIC
LUNAR LANDING (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander successfully touched down on
the Moon's surface early Sunday morning. The smooth touchdown makes
Firefly Aerospace the first commercial company in history to achieve a
fully successful soft landing on the Moon. Blue Ghost is carrying 10
NASA experiments on board. The lander will capture high-definition
imagery of the March 14 total eclipse, when the Earth will pass
between the Moon and the Sun.

 VIBE CODING AND THE FUTURE OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (9 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Vibe Coding is a mode of coding where the developer fully gives into
the vibes and forgets that the code even exists - this is made
possible by large language models (LLMs). Developers can now just talk
to LLMs and write code while barely even touching the keyboard. Even
looking at the code becomes unnecessary. The Vibe Coding meme is a
hint at where things are headed - developers are building towards a
future where AI can be harnessed to build better software products
safely and efficiently. 

 HALLUCINATIONS IN CODE ARE THE LEAST DANGEROUS FORM OF LLM MISTAKES
(4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Large language models (LLMs) make coding mistakes that aren't
instantly caught by the language compiler or interpreter all the time.
Hallucinations in LLM-generated code are usually obvious because they
result in an error, but just because code looks good and runs without
errors, doesn't mean it's actually doing the right thing. One of the
reasons LLMs won't put software professionals out of work is because
their job is to prove that code works - manually testing code is
essential. Being able to read, understand, and review code written by
other people is a crucial skill.

 THE VANISHING MIDDLE CLASS OF TECH (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The stable middle ground of tech employment - the middle-class
engineer - isn't needed anymore. Product builders who can code can
ship entire products in days when armed with AI. A single developer
can now accomplish what once required an entire team. Companies are
streamlining their operations, focusing on engineers who can use AI
and demonstrate they can do the job of multiple engineers. The biggest
losers in this shift may be the fresh graduates looking to enter the
industry - recent graduates now have to be better than people already
working. 

 “IT'S A LEMON”—OPENAI'S LARGEST AI MODEL EVER ARRIVES TO MIXED
REVIEWS (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Reviews say that OpenAI's newest AI model, GPT-4.5, is big,
expensive, and slow. The model provides marginally better performance
than GPT-4o at 30 times the cost for input and 15 times the cost for
output. There seems to be diminishing returns in training
unsupervised-learning large language models - scaling laws may have
possibly met their natural end. OpenAI seems well aware of these
limitations, which is why it released the model as a limited 'research
preview'.
