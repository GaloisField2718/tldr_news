 AGENTIC AI IS HERE. BUT CAN IT SCALE? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI has evolved—from rule-based systems to generative models to
agentic AI, where autonomous agents act with memory and context. But
without orchestration, enterprises risk complexity, chaos, and failure
to scale. 

Watch our on-demand webinar, _“__BEYOND CHATBOTS: ORCHESTRATING
AI-NATIVE ENTERPRISE WORKFLOWS,_ [4]_”_ to explore how Orkes
Conductor unifies AI agents, APIs, data, and human input into
resilient, enterprise-grade workflows. Discover real-world use cases
like fraud detection and invoice processing, and learn how to bring
governance, reliability, and human-AI collaboration into your
automation strategy.

 ELON MUSK'S NEURALINK JOINS STUDY WORKING TOWARD A BIONIC EYE (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Neuralink is collaborating with researchers in California and Spain
on a clinical trial to study visual prosthetics. The study, sponsored
by the University of California at Santa Barbara, aims to address the
fundamental questions that will allow the development of a Smart
Bionic Eye. Such a device would use AI to help blind people identify
faces, navigate the outdoors, and read, among other things. The
study's description says that researchers will use Neuralink patients
'once available'. Neuralink is developing a brainchip called
Blindsight that aims to restore vision to blind people and grant
superhuman vision. 

 META APPOINTS SHENGJIA ZHAO AS CHIEF SCIENTIST OF NEW
SUPERINTELLIGENCE LAB (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Shengjia Zhao, a former lead scientist at OpenAI, has joined Meta as
chief scientist at the company's newly established Superintelligence
Lab. Zhao, a co-creator of ChatGPT and GPT-4, will be tasked with
setting the research agenda and scientific direction for the new lab.
He will work directly with Mark Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang to steer
Meta's research efforts towards artificial general intelligence.
Industry observers see Zhao's hiring as a significant move in the
escalating AI talent war.

 CHINA'S UNITREE OFFERS A HUMANOID ROBOT FOR UNDER $6,000 (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Unitree Robotics's R1 bot has a starting price of 39,900 yuan, or
around $5,900. Weighing just 25 kilograms, it has 26 joints and is
equipped with multimodal artificial intelligence, including voice in
image recognition. If it works as advertised, the new robot marks a
milestone for the robotics industry. Chinese companies are pushing
ahead with humanoids for factories, households, and even military use
- pricing is crucial to their proliferation. 

 THE FIRST 100% EFFECTIVE HIV PREVENTION DRUG IS APPROVED AND GOING
GLOBAL (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The US Food and Drug Administration has approved lenacapavir, a drug
that offers 100% protection against HIV with twice-yearly injections.
Sold under the brand name Yeztugo, lenacapavir is a capsid inhibitor.
It stops the virus from entering cells and copying itself. Gilead has
made moves to ensure the drug is affordable - eligible uninsured
individuals will likely be able to access the drug free of cost
through its Advancing Access medication assistance program.

 ADD MULTI-TENANCY TO AN APP BUILT WITH CLERK, LOVABLE, AND SUPABASE
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 In this article, you'll learn how to create a team-ready B2B app
using Lovable, Clerk, and Supabase. We'll teach you how to implement
multi-tenancy in a React environment without manually handling JWT
parsing or user scopes. Read our guide [10]. 

 AN ENGINEER'S GUIDE TO AI CODE MODEL EVALS (30 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A crucial part of the process of improving a coding-capable AI model
is evaluation (evals). Evals are structured tests or benchmarks used
to measure model performance on specific tasks. They are analogous to
unit tests or integration tests in software. This post explores what
evals are, how they're constructed, what 'hill climbing' means in
model development, and how all these pieces connect to the continuous
training and improvement of coding models. 

 IT'S TIME FOR MODERN CSS TO KILL THE SPA (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Modern CSS can provide seamless navigation without the need to build
an app. New capabilities enable fading between pages, animating shared
elements, maintaining persistent elements, and more, all with real
URLs, real page loads, and without JavaScript routing hacks. This
article discusses how. Most websites don't need to be apps - build a
site like a site.

 THE NEW CHIPS DESIGNED TO SOLVE AI'S ENERGY PROBLEM (6 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The estimated growth in energy required for AI is currently
unsustainable. Several startups and companies are experimenting with
new kinds of chips that have the potential to be much more energy
efficient than current industry leaders at the all-important task of
inference. While Nvidia chips will continue to be used for AI training
for the foreseeable future, more efficient inference could
collectively save companies tens of billions of dollars. The intensity
of these chip development efforts shows how desperate the tech world
is to provide AI to customers without paying the 'Nvidia tax'. 

 ELON MUSK INTERVIEW: X TAKEOVER EVENT (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Elon Musk recently sat down for an interview at the X Takeover 2025
event held in San Mateo, California. During the interview, Musk spoke
candidly about Tesla's Optimus robot, Neuralink's potential medical
applications, and more, offering wide-ranging insights into his
companies. Despite regulatory and logistical hurdles, Tesla's roadmap
remains ambitious and far-reaching. A video of the interview is linked
in the article.
