 STOP PULLING DEVELOPERS INTO QA. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Testing slows developers down. Every hour spent investigating
failures, fixing flaky tests, or running regressions delays releases
and limits what your team can ship.

QA Wolf [5] takes testing off your team's plate by combining AI [6]
with expert QA engineers to build and maintain 80% automated coverage
[7] in weeks, not months. Tests run in parallel, suites finish in
minutes, and failures are real—not false alarms. Workflows stay
current as your app evolves, and brittle tests are repaired
automatically.  

Developers get clean feedback fast, stay focused on features, and
releases ship faster with fewer surprises. Book a demo now. [8]

 INSIDE APPLE'S PIVOT FROM A ‘VISION AIR' HEADSET TO META-LIKE SMART
GLASSES (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple's shift to smart glasses suggests that the company no longer
views the Vision Pro approach as a viable mass-market platform. The
company doesn't invest heavily into products that lack the potential
to become mainstream hits, and it doesn't chase niche markets. Smart
glasses are a much more portable and practical form factor that could
one day evolve into a future iPhone replacement, something the Vision
Pro can never achieve. While Apple may someday decide to make the
Vision Air after all, the decision now to focus on smart glasses is
the logical path. 

 THINKING MACHINES LAB CO-FOUNDER DEPARTS FOR META (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Andrew Tulloch, one of the co-founders of Mira Murati's Thinking
Machines Lab, has left to join Meta. Tulloch previously worked at Meta
for 11 years. He is a leading researcher in the field of artificial
intelligence and worked at OpenAI before co-founding Thinking Machines
Lab. It is unclear what team he will be on at Meta.

 SCIENTISTS DISCOVERED A NEW CREATURE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN LIFE AND
NOT-LIFE (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Sukunaarchaeum mirabile is a cellular entity that offloads certain
biological functions onto hosts like a virus, but it also contains the
necessary genes to create its own ribosomes and messenger RNA. With
just 238,000 base pairs of DNA, Sukunaarchaeum pushes the conventional
boundaries of cellular life. Its discovery highlights the vast
unexplored biological novelty within microbial interactions. 

 CHINA'S 'DARWIN MONKEY' IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST BRAIN-INSPIRED
SUPERCOMPUTER (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Darwin Monkey, also known as 'Wukong', is a supercomputer built to
emulate a monkey's brain structure. It features over 2 billion
artificial neurons and more than 100 billion synapses, roughly on par
with the neural structure of a macaque. The supercomputer will serve
as a tool for neuroscientists while also acting as a stepping stone
toward artificial general intelligence. It consumes just 2,000 watts
of power despite being powered by 960 Darwin III neuromorphic chips,
each supporting up to 2.35 million spiking neurons.

 VIBING A NON-TRIVIAL GHOSTTY FEATURE (20 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Ghotty's unobtrusive update notification feature was largely
developed with AI. This post shares the agentic coding sessions that
led to shipping the feature. It provides context about the process and
reasoning. AI is best used as an assistant and not a replacement.
While AI can do a lot of the work, developers will almost always still
need to intervene at times. 

 PEEKING INSIDE GIGANTIC ZIPS WITH ONLY KILOBYTES (4 MINUTE READ) [14]


 ZIPs are a stack of per-file records with an index that documents
what's inside and where to find it. It is possible to make a few tiny
HTTP requests to quickly inspect a multi-gigabyte archive. This post
walks readers through the process with a working demo.

 WHAT IF SPORTSCENTER AND LINKEDIN MERGED? (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 TBPN (Technology Business Programming Network) is a show where Jordi
Hays and John Coogan chat about the worlds of tech and business. The
show became a sensation practically overnight after its first episode
aired last October. Executives from OpenAI, Palantir, and Andreessen
Horowitz appear regularly on the show. The show's audience is
relatively small, but it considers CNBC and Fox Business to be its
competitors. Its fans include Larry Ellison, Mark Cuban, and Travis
Kalanick. 

 SELF ACTUALIZATION (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 When Andrew Bosworth started Meta's Bootcamp program in 2008, he
didn't teach the culture as it was: he taught it as he wished it were.
New engineers didn't know the difference. The company grew fast, and
within a year, more than half of the engineering team had learned
about the culture from him. When onboarding in a high-growth
organization, you aren't just teaching people how things work, you're
deciding what kind of company they believe they've joined.
