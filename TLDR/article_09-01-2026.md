MINUTE READ) [4] 

 xAI's losses are mounting as it spends to build data centers, recruit

robots. The company reported that it spent $7.8 billion in cash in the

in September. xAI expects to do more deals soon to continue building

 THE MAN WHO COULD BE APPLE'S NEXT CEO (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 John Ternus, Apple's head of hardware engineering, could be next in
line to replace Tim Cook as CEO if he steps aside. Ternus, who joined
Apple in 2001, is known for his attention to detail and knowledge of
Apple's vast supply network. Apple began accelerating planning for
Cook's succession last year after Cook told senior leaders he would
like to reduce his workload. Cook will likely become the chairman of
Apple's board should he step down as CEO.

REPLACEMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, Wendy, have announced

is a space-based telescope named Lazuli that is designed to be a more
capable and modern version of the Hubble Space Telescope. The
Schmidts' investment, estimated to be worth half a billion dollars,
has enormous potential to advance the study of astronomy and
astrophysics.

 TVs today are vastly cheaper than they were 25 years ago, even before
adjusting for inflation. The price per area-pixel has fallen by more
than 90%. It's not surprising that the cost of the technology
declined. Virtually all of the major mechanisms that can drive

MINUTE READ) [10] 

 China is reviewing Meta's recent acquisition of AI startup Manus, a
warning to Chinese entrepreneurs interested in Silicon Valley riches.

strategic importance to an export-control list. Manus' parent company
was set up by Chinese co-founders in China, but it moved its
headquarters to Singapore last year to expand its global user base.
