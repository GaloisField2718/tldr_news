 🚀 FASTER MOBILE APP RELEASES WITH AUTOMATED QA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND LIMITED. Teams CUT
RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before submitting them to app
stores— and without broad device coverage, issues slip through.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-NATIVE SERVICE delivers 80% automated test coverage
[6] in weeks, with tests running on REAL IOS DEVICES AND ANDROID
EMULATORS—all in 100% parallel with zero flakes [7].

✅ QA cycles cut to 15 minutes

✅ Multi-device + gesture interactions supported

✅ Reliable test execution with zero flakes

✅ Human-verified bug reports

ENGINEERING TEAMS MOVE FASTER, releases stay on track, and testing
runs automatically—freeing developers to build, not debug

⭐ Rated 4.8/5 on G2

 NVIDIA ANNOUNCES BLACKWELL ULTRA AND RUBIN AI CHIPS (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Nvidia has announced new chips for building and deploying artificial
intelligence models. Blackwell Ultra will allow cloud providers to
make as much as 50 times the revenue as chips from the Hopper
generation - it will ship in the second half of this year. Vera Rubin,
which is expected to ship in the second half of 2026, is a system with
two main components: a CPU called Vera and a new GPU design called
Rubin. The custom Vera design will be twice as fast as the CPU used in
last year's Grace Blackwell chips - it will enable Rubin to manage 50
petaflops while doing inference, more than double the capacity of the
company's current Blackwell chips. 

 HERE'S WHY GOOGLE PITCHED ITS $32B WIZ ACQUISITION AS ‘MULTICLOUD'
(4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google is acquiring Wiz for $32 billion. Wiz will continue to be
positioned as a multicloud offering. The acquisition brings a massive
customer list to Google, so the companies need to ensure existing
customers don't start shopping around for another security provider.
Many customers chose Wiz due to its ability to support multiple cloud
platforms - cutting off that ability risks alienating those users.
Google Cloud trails significantly behind its competitors with a 12%
share of the global cloud market.

 NVIDIA AND GOOGLE DEEPMIND WILL HELP POWER DISNEY'S CUTE ROBOTS (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Nvidia and Google DeepMind's Newton is a physics engine that can
simulate robotic movements in real-world settings. It will be used by
Disney to power its next-generation entertainment robots - a video of
one of these robots is available in the article. Newton helps robots
be more expressive and learn how to handle complex tasks with
precision. It is highly customizable - developers can use it to
program robotic interactions with a range of deformable objects.
Newton will be compatible with Google DeepMind's ecosystem of robotic
development tools. 

 HERE'S THE SECRET TO HOW FIREFLY WAS ABLE TO NAIL ITS FIRST LUNAR
LANDING (22 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander, part of NASA's Commercial
Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, has accomplished a lot on the
Moon in the last two weeks. It has drilled into the Moon's surface,
tested an extraterrestrial vacuum cleaner, demonstrated that GPS can
be used to navigate on the lunar surface, and sent daily imagery back
to Earth. All of the mission objectives for the Blue Ghost mission
have been met. This article details how Firefly managed to secure the
first fully successful commercial lunar landing, the challenges
Firefly's engineers have had to overcome, some of the discoveries that
Blue Ghost has made so far, and the progress of other missions in the
CLPS program.

 BREAKING UP WITH ON-CALL (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 On-call, in its current state in Big Tech, is flawed. AI is already
changing the scope of on-call and the responsibility of the engineer
in the loop. Some on-call will always be unavoidable, but it should be
the exception rather than the norm. This will give engineers time to
concentrate on meaningful tasks, which will make customers happier. 

 THE SYNCHRONY BUDGET (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Services should minimize the number of synchronous requests they make
to other services as much as possible. Synchronous calls are costly
and impact the availability of services. The more services that an app
relies on synchronously, the lower the availability of that app will
be. Making a synchrony budget is about being mindful of how
communication flows are implemented between services.

 HE NERDED OUT OVER PAYROLL TECHNOLOGY. NOW, HE'S ACCUSED OF CORPORATE
SPYING (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Keith O'Brien, a global payroll-compliance manager at Rippling, a
business software startup, has been accused of stealing trade secrets
for a rival, Deel, as part of a spying operation. O'Brien allegedly
searched for 'deel' an average of 23 times a day across Rippling's
internal systems, accessing message boards that had nothing to do with
his job in a mode that hid his presence from others. Rippling claims
that it set a honeypot trap that proved O'Brien was being directed by
Deel's top executives. O'Brien fleed Rippling's offices with his
smartphone after being accused of being a corporate spy despite being
told that failing to turn over the device violated a court order and
could result in imprisonment. 

 THE FIRST NEW PEBBLE SMARTWATCHES ARE COMING LATER THIS YEAR (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Core Devices, a company by the original creator of the Pebble
smartwatch, is getting ready to ship two new watches. They will have
all of the features of the old Pebble devices and run the newly
open-sourced Pebble operating system. The Core 2 Duo will ship in July
for $149. It has the exact same black-and-white e-paper display as the
old Pebble 2 and even comes in the exact same frame. It has a battery
that lasts more than 30 days and an in-device speaker for chatting
with AI assistants. The Core Time 2 will ship in December and cost
$225 - it will have a touchscreen.
