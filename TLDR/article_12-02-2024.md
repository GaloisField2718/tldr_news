 SAM ALTMAN SEEKING TRILLIONS FOR AI CHIP FABRICATION FROM UAE, OTHERS
(4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is in talks with investors to raise up to $7
trillion for AI chip manufacturing. The project aims to address GPU
scarcity as the chips are crucial for training and running large
language models. Potential investors include sovereign wealth funds
and government entities, which may raise geopolitical concerns. The US
has been cautious about allowing foreign control over the supply of
microchips - it recently announced a $5 billion investment in R&D to
advance US-made semiconductor technologies. 

 OPENAI'S NEXT AI PRODUCT COULD BE AFTER YOUR JOB (AGAIN) (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has been reportedly developing two types of AI agent software
for over a year. The first type can be used to automate complex tasks
by taking over a customer's device. The second AI agent class handles
web-based tasks and can gather public data. It is unclear when the
company plans to release these agents.

 WITH DISNEY‚ÄôS MAGIC, FORTNITE IS POISED TO WIN THE METAVERSE (9
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Epic Games and Disney are designing an entertainment universe text
full of Disney-flavored games to play and things to buy. The project
will use Epic's technology and Fortnite's social gaming ecosystem to
bring Disney characters to life. Disney has invested $1.5 billion into
Epic as part of the deal. While Meta has been busy trying to make the
Oculus a mainstream consumer product, companies like Epic have been
building avatar-driven virtual worlds that are widely available and
hardware agnostic. 

 HOW TO FAKE A ROBOTICS DEMO FOR FUN AND PROFIT (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Developments in robots and CGI are making it harder and harder to
tell what's real. Even if the footage is real, video demos are often
the best-performing clips - behind every video is likely hours and
hours of video that didn't make it into the final cut. CES lacked cool
robotic demos, yet there are many amazing videos out there. Viewers
should approach these videos with discernment and skepticism. This
article covers several ways that robotics videos can be enhanced or
faked.

 ALL MY THOUGHTS AFTER 40 HOURS IN THE VISION PRO (30 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 This article takes a look at the Apple Vision Pro: its hardware,
operating system, and applications. It covers each part of the device,
explaining how they work and how they affect the experience. While the
technology feels incredible to use, there's currently not that much to
do on the device. As the technology gets better, the amount of content
will multiply and its value proposition will improve. 

 THOUGHTS ON TECH EMPLOYMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tech companies are typically best at adopting new technology, leading
to productivity gains. Some roles at tech companies are highly
leveraged, like systems, engineering, and design, and the rest of the
company exists to support these roles. Businesses wanting to be more
efficient will cut inefficiencies in their support roles, especially
when technologies exist that can replace them. Tech allows fewer
people to create more value for society - it might be time to start
finding alternative ways to provide for all living beings.
