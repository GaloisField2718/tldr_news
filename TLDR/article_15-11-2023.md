 SPACEX TO LAUNCH STARSHIP‚ÄôS SECOND ORBITAL TEST THIS WEEKEND: WHAT
TO KNOW (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX may launch the second Starship orbital test as soon as this
Friday. Elon Musk said on X that SpaceX will receive a launch license
from the Federal Aviation Administration in time for the launch. The
last orbital attempt was almost seven months ago - it ended in a
mid-air explosion that led to a months-long federal investigation. The
FAA and the US Fish and Wildlife Service have yet to announce the
completion of an environmental review for the test. The most critical
part of the test flight will be hot staging, where Starship's upper
stage separates from its boost and ignites its own engines.

owners. Nothing claims that its setup is completely legal and that it
doesn't see any scenario in which Apple could block it.

 AI OUTPERFORMS CONVENTIONAL WEATHER FORECASTING FOR THE FIRST TIME:
GOOGLE STUDY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An AI meteorology model from Google DeepMind called GraphCast
significantly outperforms conventional weather forecasting methods in
predicting global weather conditions up to 10 days in advance.
GraphCast outperformed the world's leading conventional system in 90%
of 1,380 metrics. It can predict hundreds of weather variables over 10
days at 0.25¬∞ resolution globally in under a minute. GraphCast is
estimated to be about 1,000 times cheaper in terms of energy
consumption compared to traditional methods.
