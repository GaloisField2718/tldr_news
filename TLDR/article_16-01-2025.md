 🗺️ OFFSHORING IS TEMPTING - BUT OFTEN FAILS TO PAY OFF (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 You might be tempted to save a few bucks by offshoring IT staff to a
developing country on the other side of the world. But things tend to
look very different when the rework bills start piling up…

Instead, many companies are choosing nearshore IT staff augmentation
[4], which gives them access to highly skilled staff operating in the
same time zone and culture as their in-house team.

Growth Acceleration Partners [4] offers a pool of highly-skilled AI
solutions architects, software engineers, data scientists and
automation experts, at affordable rates and with easy on-site visits.

 LEAKED SAMSUNG GALAXY S25 SLIM IMAGES SHOW OFF ITS SUPER-THIN DESIGN
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Images of what appears to be the Samsung Galaxy 25 Slim have leaked.
The super-thin smartphone has a flat front, flat back, flat sides, and
three cameras on the back. It will be 6.4mm thick, about 1.2mm thinner
than the Galaxy S24 and nearly 2mm thinner than the Galaxy S25 Ultra.
The phone's camera system will include a 200-megapixel main camera, a
50-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 50-megapixel telephoto lens with
3.5X optical zoom and a special design. It will have a Snapdragon 8
Elite chip and 12GB of RAM. The phone will apparently launch in May
and may be showcased at Samsung's January 22 Galaxy Unpacked event.

MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TikTok employees in the US will still have jobs even if the app is
banned in the country. The company is apparently not planning to leave
the US in the near term even if it is banned. The Supreme Court is
expected to make a decision on whether to overturn the ban before the
law takes effect on Sunday. TikTok's leadership team remains laser
focused on planning for various scenarios and is continuing to plan
the way forward.

 SPACEX LAUNCHES 2 LUNAR LANDERS ON PATH TO THE MOON (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 SpaceX's 100th launch of a Falcon rocket from pad 39A yesterday sent
two landers on their way to the Moon. The mission also featured a
successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage on the Just Read The
Instructions drone ship. It will take about 45 days for Firefly
Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander to reach lunar orbit, after which the
landing process will take just over an hour. The Resilience lander,
which is carrying a 5kg rover dubbed Tenacious, will reach the moon in
approximately four to five months, after which it will complete a
lunar flyby before entering orbit around the Moon. 

 CHINA PLANS TO BUILD ENORMOUS SOLAR ARRAY IN SPACE — AND IT COULD
COLLECT MORE ENERGY IN A YEAR THAN 'ALL THE OIL ON EARTH' (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Chinese scientists plan to build an enormous, 0.6-mile-wide solar
power station in space that will beam continuous energy back to Earth
via microwaves. The project has been dubbed 'another Three Gorges Dam
project above the Earth'. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest
hydropower project. Based in China, it generates 100 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity each year. The US, EU, and Japan have
also been investigating solar satellite array technology - Japan's
JAXA is set to launch its proof-of-concept satellite this year.

 DESIGNING FOR DEVELOPERS MEANS DESIGNING FOR LLMS TOO (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Most large language models (LLMs) aren't great at using less popular
frameworks. This shouldn't be surprising, but it is an important
developer experience problem. A simple and effective solution is for
the framework to tailor instructions specifically designed for LLMs,
rewriting documents, adding conventions and rules, and packaging the
instructions. This can make LLMs much better at building apps for less
well-known frameworks. 

 STRUCTURED LOGPROBS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 This Python library enhances OpenAI chat completion response by
adding detailed information about token log properties. It works with
OpenAI Structured Outputs, a feature that ensures models will always
generate responses that add here to a supplied JSON Schema. The
library provides utilities for analyzing and incorporating token-level
log probabilities into structured outputs to help developers
understand the reliability of structured data extracted from OpenAI
models.

 THE DOWNFALL OF INDIA'S HOT STARTUP IS WIPING OUT US DEBTHOLDERS (6
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Byju's, the most valuable startup in India's history, was willing to
pay handsomely to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars in the US. It
received $1.2 billion towards a global expansion. The company
collapsed, setting off legal proceedings that may leave investors
recouping only a small fraction of what they're owed. The case is a
lesson about the perils of lending when money can rapidly disappear
across borders. 

 NYC CONGESTION PRICING: EARLY DAYS (28 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article looks at the effects of congestion pricing and its
impacts on traffic, time, enforcement, rideshare services, the people
living in congestion pricing zones, and more. New York City now has
congestion pricing - people have to pay $9 to enter Manhattan below
60th Street. This has dramatically improved traffic in tunnels and
bridges. The policy is aimed in part at getting people to switch from
cars to trains, but trains have not seemed more crowded than usual.
