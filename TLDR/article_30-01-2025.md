 BARDEEN INTRODUCES THE AI COPILOT FOR GTM TEAMS: “IT'S LIKE AN
IRONMAN SUIT FOR GTM PROFESSIONALS 🚀” (SPONSOR) [4] 

 GTM teams are drowning in tool bloat. 

Companies spend $4,830 per employee who use 275 SaaS apps [4] on
average, and these tools rarely talk to each other, forcing precious
human hours to be spent acting as glue.

Bardeen's AI Copilot [5] is here to restore productivity and sanity.
Lead sourcing, outreach, sales ops, reporting, competitive
intelligence… if it grows your business, Bardeen can automate it
fully end-to-end.

Companies like DEEL, MIRO, and KEARNEY are already using it to rocket
past competitors.

 ELON MUSK CLAIMS TESLA WILL LAUNCH A SELF-DRIVING SERVICE IN AUSTIN
IN JUNE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk claimed during a recent earnings call that Tesla plans to
launch a paid ride-hailing robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.
The vehicles will use the yet-unreleased 'unsupervised' version of
Tesla's Full Self-Driving software. That software is expected to be
released to Tesla owners in California and other regions in the US
this year. Tesla owners will not be able to add their cars to the
Tesla ride-hail fleet until at least next year. 

 THE X EVERYTHING APP WILL LAUNCH THIS YEAR, AIMING TO COMPETE WITH
APPLE PAY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 X CEO Linda Yaccarino says that X will launch its Everything App this
year. The app will allow for secure and instant funding to X Wallets
via Visa Direct. Users will be able to connect their debit cards for
P2P payments. There will be an option for users to instantly transfer
funds to their bank accounts.

 CHINA SECRETLY BUILDING WORLD'S LARGEST NUCLEAR FUSION LASER, US
SATELLITE EXPOSES (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 China is developing a laser fusion research facility in the
southwestern region of the country. It will be larger than the US
National Ignition Facility, the current world's largest inertial
confinement fusion facility. The new development could have huge
implications for both nuclear weapons research and clean energy
production. China has not revealed the purpose of the facility. 

 STEM CELLS USED TO PARTIALLY REPAIR DAMAGED HEARTS (4 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 A group of German researchers have developed a method for repairing
the heart using new muscle generated from stem cells. The results are
promising and they have started clinical trials. The technique
involves creating sheets of cells and combining them into a single
patch that can be attached to the heart's exterior. In experiments,
the scientists found that the added tissues integrated into the hearts
functionally and immature stem cells did not form tumors. The implants
weren't problem-free - some of the stem cells in the sheets appeared
to be uncommitted to a mature state and one animal generated an immune
response to the implanted cells.

 KUBERNETES HISTORY INSPECTOR (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Kubernetes History Inspector is a log visualization tool for
Kubernetes clusters that transforms vast quantities of logs into an
interactive, comprehensive timeline view. It is an invaluable tool for
troubleshooting complex issues that span multiple components within
Kubernetes clusters. The tool uses existing logs, allowing users to
troubleshoot past issues as long as logs are still available. Examples
of the interactive timeline visualizations the tool produces are
available in the repository. 

 MATHESAR (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Mathesar is a web app that enables users of all technical skill
levels to view, edit, query, and collaborate on PostgreSQL databases
using a familiar spreadsheet-like interface. It is self-hosted and can
be deployed in minutes. Mathesar works directly with PostgreSQL
databases, schemas, and tables without extra abstractions. Data never
leaves users' servers and there is access control based on PostgreSQL
roles and privileges to keep databases secure.

 ON DEEPSEEK AND EXPORT CONTROLS (28 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 DeepSeek's achievements make export control policies more
existentially important than they were a week ago. Export controls
keep democratic nations at the forefront of AI development. The idea
that the technology getting cheaper and more powerful is a reason to
lift export controls makes no sense - they are one of the most
powerful tools for preventing authoritarian governments from behaving
aggressively on the world stage. DeepSeek's release is roughly on the
expected cost reduction curve, which big tech has already factored
into its calculations - it will still require billions of dollars of
infrastructure to make AI that is smarter than almost all humans at
almost all things. 

 ZUCK SHRUGS OFF DEEPSEEK, VOWS TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS ON AI (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Mark Zuckerberg said during Meta's first-quarter earnings call on
Wednesday that the company will be investing very heavily in AI this
year. Meta considers DeepSeek a new competitor, but it says that it is
way too early to tell if demand for chips will stop increasing, as
they are still crucial for inference. The company is aiming to make
Llama 4 the world's most competitive model. Llama 4 is expected to
have multimodal and agentic capabilities.
