 ONE DAY LEFT: INVEST BEFORE THE PLANNED NASDAQ LISTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your final opportunity to invest in Sky Quarry's current offering¬†
ahead of their planned Nasdaq listing [4] is TOMORROW. Sky Quarry's
revenue grew 211% last year, at $50M, and we believe that they're just
getting started. And we think that hardly compares to the opportunity
ahead: 15M+ TONS of asphalt shingles are dumped in landfills every
year, amounting to $4.4B in market potential [4]. Sky Quarry's
flagship facility aims to produce 2,000 barrels of oil per day by
2025. With just one day left, Invest now before their current offering
ends and their planned Nasdaq listing.

This is a paid advertisement for Sky Quarry's Regulation A Offering.
Additional information on the company and risk factors related to the
offering can be found in the Form 1-A offering circular [4].

 AMAZON TELLS EMPLOYEES TO RETURN TO OFFICE FIVE DAYS A WEEK (11
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has instructed corporate staffers to spend five
days a week in the office starting on January 2. The decision is a
significant shift from Amazon's earlier return-to-work stance, which
required corporate workers to be in the office at least three days a
week. Amazon also plans to simplify its corporate structure by having
fewer managers, with each S-team organization expected to increase its
ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the
end of the first quarter of 2025. A copy of the full memo from Jassy
is available in the article. 

 TIKTOK ARGUED AGAINST ITS U.S. BAN IN COURT TODAY. HERE'S WHAT
HAPPENED (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 On Monday, a panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for
the DC Circuit heard TikTok's arguments against a law that will force
the company to find a non-Chinese buyer or be banned nationwide. It
was unclear which way the court was leaning, but the judges appeared
dubious of TikTok's plea that its right to free expression surpasses
national security concerns. However, the judges did point out that
shutting down the app could violate the rights of US TikTok users and
TikTok's US operations. TikTok's strategy of trying to overturn the
law by attacking Congress' legislative authority is unusual - it
appears that it may be asking the court to send the law back to
Congress to be amended.

 "GOLDEN LETTUCE" GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TO PACK 30 TIMES MORE
VITAMINS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A team from the Research Institute for Plant Molecular and Cellular
Biology has genetically engineered lettuce to boost its nutrients.
They increased levels of an antioxidant called beta-carotene, which
the body uses to make vitamin A. The high levels of the antioxidant
make the leaves of the lettuce a striking yellow color, giving it the
nickname Golden Lettuce. Golden Lettuce has up to 30 times more
beta-carotene than regular lettuce. Developing the lettuce involved
accumulating the antioxidant in parts of the plant's cells where it is
not normally found. 

 CHIPOTLE'S TESTING AN AVOCADO-PEELING ROBOT AND AN AUTOMATED BOWL
ASSEMBLY LINE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Chipotle's Autocado machine can cut, core, and peel avocados by the
case. It can get an avocado of any size peeled and seeded within 26
seconds. The Autocado is currently being tested in a store in
California with the aim of freeing up employees for other tasks.
Chipotle is also testing a machine that builds bowls and salads, which
make up about 65% of its digital orders.

 KTY (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 kty is an SSH server that makes it easy to access Kubernetes
resources without using kubectl. It provides a dashboard for
interacting with clusters that enables users to run shells in pods,
access logs for running and exited containers in a pod, forward
traffic from a local machine into a cluster or from a cluster to a
local machine, access clusters from any device with an SSH client, and
more. kty relies on OpenID providers to verify identity. 

 PYTHON IN EXCEL (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Python in Excel is now generally available for Windows users of
Microsoft 365 Business and Enterprise. The feature makes it possible
to seamlessly combine Python and Excel analytics within the same
workbook. Python in Excel keeps data private by preventing Python code
from knowing who users are and opening workbooks from the internet in
further isolation within their own separate containers. The data does
not persist in the Microsoft Cloud. This page provides examples of
what is now possible with the integration.

 WHAT IF OZEMPIC IS JUST A GOOD THING? (17 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The public discussion of Ozempic's economics has so far been
consistently fatalistic. Many doubt that the drug will benefit more
than just the lucky few who can afford it. The people who most need
the drug often struggle to get it. As long as it is talked about
primarily as a weight loss drug, insurance companies will remain
incentivized to treat it as a luxury good. The drug presents a radical
opportunity to change the chronic disease landscape in the US, but it
may require radical policy changes to make it accessible. 

 WORDS ON FOUNDER MODE (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Founder Mode is the culture of a company, and a culture is defined by
the character of the founders. It is when the whole team is involved
with the details and work - when an organizational chart becomes more
like a map than a power structure. While there is job specialization,
there is also a belief that everyone is equally accountable for the
product. A stratification of responsibility is a red flag in any
company.
