 MICROSOFT IS CONFIDENT WINDOWS ON ARM COULD FINALLY BEAT APPLE (5
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Microsoft will unveil its vision for AI PCs at an event in Seattle on
May 20. The company is confident that its new Arm-powered Windows
laptops will beat Apple's M3-powered MacBook Air in both CPU
performance and AI-accelerated tasks. The laptops will feature
Snapdragon X Elite processors from Qualcomm. Microsoft is planning to
ship consumer models of its Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 with
Snapdragon X Elite processors instead of the Intel Core Ultra
processors that the business-focused versions have. 

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES ANDROID FIND MY DEVICE NETWORK (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google has launched the Find My Device network for Android-based
products. The Android Find My Device network can use the millions of
existing Android devices to track down lost, stolen, and missing
Android products. The network uses Bluetooth and works even when
Android devices are offline and do not have a cellular or Wi-Fi
connection. The network will also work with third-party Bluetooth
trackers starting in May.

 ELON MUSK JUST GAVE ANOTHER MARS SPEECH ‚Äî THIS TIME THE VISION
SEEMS TANGIBLE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk gave a 45-minute speech at SpaceX's Starbase facility in
South Texas last weekend about making life multiplanetary, the booster
for Starship, the upper stage, and SpaceX's plans to ultimately
deliver millions of tons of cargo to Mars for a self-sustaining
civilization. SpaceX has now completed 327 successful launches, with
80% of those involving used boosters. This performance has given Musk
confidence that reusability can be achieved with the Super Heavy
booster that powers Starship. While SpaceX's goals seem audacious, the
company has proven that rocket reusability is a very viable thing, so
its other goals appear a lot more achievable. 

 A SECRET CLIMATE EXPERIMENT IN ALAMEDA (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A group of scientists launched a stream of microscopic salt particles
off the deck of a decommissioned aircraft carrier last Tuesday in
Alameda, California, as part of an experiment to limit global warming
by increasing cloud cover to reflect sunlight away from Earth. Very
few people knew about the project beforehand as geoengineering
projects are controversial and the team was concerned that critics
would try to stop them. The experiment will run through the end of
May, and visitors are able to view the experiment.

 HOW CAN I ACCELERATE MY PERSONAL GROWTH? (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Growing quickly requires a job that surrounds you with people who are
smarter than you and gives you opportunities to fail, with a company
that has a history of giving massive responsibility to people similar
to you. Choose companies that are selective with hiring and target
positions where success is not guaranteed. Look for people in the
company who have similar profiles as you and see if they have been
given outsized responsibility in the company to see if you have a
chance to get promoted quickly. These selection criteria are heavily
weighted towards startups. 

 NOTES ON HOW TO USE LLMS IN YOUR PRODUCT (17 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 It's easy to make an argument that large language models can improve
internal efficiency in companies somehow. It's much harder to describe
a believable way for them to make products more useful to customers.
This article discusses ways to meaningfully integrate large language
models into existing products. It covers how to think about the
technology, revamping workflows, different ways to implement models,
and more. The article also covers potential issues such as copyright
law, data processing agreements, and provider availability.
