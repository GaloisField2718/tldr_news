 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native solution provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA
cycle to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks [6]—not years
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs [7]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of engineers [8] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

 JEFF BEZOS CREATES AI START-UP WHERE HE WILL BE CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Jeff Bezos' new company, Project Prometheus, is coming out of the
gates with $6.2 billion in funding and nearly 100 employees, including
researchers poached from OpenAI, DeepMind, and Meta. The company is
focused on AI that will help engineering and manufacturing in a number
of fields. It will create systems that can learn from the physical
world in more complex ways than chatbots do. Bezos will be co-chief
executive - this is the first time he has taken a formal operational
role in a company since stepping down as chief executive of Amazon in
July 2021. 

 BLUE ORIGIN NO LONGER JUST A ROCKET COMPANY AS MARS ‘ON RADAR' (1
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Blue Origin is now a manufacturing company that can build rockets at
scale. The firm's mission has grown beyond just launching payloads. To
go to the Moon, the company must be able to build all of the hardware
needed to get to orbit at a rate fast enough to sustain large-scale
missions. Blue Origin successfully landed its New Glenn booster for
the first time last week. It is looking to conduct another New Glenn
launch next year.

 TODAY, VALAR ATOMICS BECAME THE FIRST STARTUP IN HISTORY TO SPLIT THE
ATOM (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Valar Atomics' Project Nova core achieved zero-power criticality for
the first time yesterday morning. Zero-power criticality is a
foundation milestone that precedes nuclear operation with power. The
achievement will allow Valar to gain a greater understanding of the
neutronic characteristics of the core and verify assumptions about
fuel, moderators, active reactivity control, and burnable poisons. It
marks a decisive step toward commercial-scale, factory-built nuclear
reactors capable of powering heavy industry, hydrogen production, and
AI-era data infrastructure with carbon-free energy. 

 CHINA IS ONE STEP CLOSER TO PERPETUAL ENERGY INDEPENDENCE (9 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 An experimental reactor built in the Gobi Desert has achieved
thorium-to-uranium fuel conversion, bringing humanity one step closer
to an almost endless supply of nuclear energy. Thorium is much more
abundant and accessible than uranium and generates far less
radioactive waste. The entire thorium-to-uranium process takes place
inside the reactor core, eliminating the need for external fuel
fabrication. The system, which uses molten salt, requires no water at
all, allowing it to be built almost anywhere.

 112 TOOLS, $5,000 PER EMPLOYEE: FORRESTER REVEALS THE REAL COSTS OF
TOOL SPRAWL (SPONSOR) [14] 

 Large organizations spend nearly $5,000 per person annually on
enterprise tools. But according to Forrester's latest research [14],
cutting costs isn't about eliminating tools — it's about cutting
friction. In this webinar with Miro, Forrester's Bobby Cameron breaks
down why consolidation only focused on ROI fails and introduces the
High-Performance IT framework for smarter tool consolidation
decisions. Watch on-demand [14] 

 CRAFT YOUR CHROME DEVTOOLS PROTOCOL (CDP) COMMANDS EFFICIENTLY WITH
THE NEW COMMAND EDITOR (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Chrome Devtools has introduced a new CDP editor that auto-completes
commands, auto-populates command parameters, simplifies the typing of
parameters, and improves prototyping speed. It can be used to view
parameters alongside documentation. This post provides an overview of
what the new CDP editor offers and how users can make the most use of
it. 

 TOWARDS INTERPLANETARY QUIC TRAFFIC (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Deep space is big, making it challenging to run a network. One of the
promising ways seems to be adopting the IP protocol suite. QUIC is
becoming the protocol of choice for reliable communication. This post
looks at how QUIC can reliably operate in deep space and provides
guidance on how to deploy it.

 HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS AN INTUITION-PUMP FOR AI RISK (29 MINUTE READ) [17]


 It's wise to take a pause and look around when one faces
uncertainties. Taking a temporary pause on training larger AI models
isn't taking a Luddite stance. Leaders at AI companies have a
probability of doom as high as 25% and yet keep racing to build
bigger, more powerful AI models. Instead of racing towards something
we don't understand and may not be able to control, we should pause
and search for answers. 

 EUROPE BEGINS RETHINKING ITS CRACKDOWN ON BIG TECH (9 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 The European Commission plans to unveil a 'digital package of
simplification' tomorrow that will rewrite key aspects of the General
Data Protection Regulation and delay parts of a law restricting
certain uses of AI. The EU's tech laws have long been criticized for
stifling economic growth. The digital simplification package is part
of a broader deregulatory push.
