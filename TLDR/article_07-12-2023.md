 PILOTLESS FEDEX, RELIABLE ROBOTICS PLANE COMPLETES FLIGHT (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Reliable Robotics Corp. has flown a small cargo plane without a human
on board. The 12-minute flight, made with a plane on loan from FedEx,
was Reliable Robotics' second automated flight. The startup is working
to gain full approval from the FAA. Its system will restrict remote
pilots to only supervising one aircraft at a time rather than managing
multiple autonomous flights. Remote piloting will boost efficiency and
allow planes to be repositioned more easily to match where demand is
strongest.

universe. This article looks at some current ideas and prototypes in
the field.
