 ELON MUSK‚ÄôS AI STARTUP ‚Äî X.AI ‚Äî FILES TO RAISE $1 BILLION IN
FRESH CAPITAL (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 X.AI has filed with the SEC to raise up to $1 billion in an equity
offering. It has already raised nearly $135 million from four
investors and has a binding and enforceable agreement for the purchase
of the remaining shares. The startup released an AI chatbot with
real-time knowledge of the internet called Grok last month. It aims to
directly compete with companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. 

 NASA SAYS SPACEX‚ÄôS NEXT STARSHIP FLIGHT COULD TEST REFUELING TECH
(9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX and NASA may be demonstrating orbital refueling technology on
the next Starship test flight. NASA has yet to make a decision on when
to start testing the capability. Cryogenic propellants must be kept at
super-low temperatures or they turn into a gas and boil off. Rockets
using these types of propellants typically need to complete their
missions within hours - NASA wants to extend this lifetime to months
and enable the transfer of the propellants from one vehicle to
another.

 Agility Robotics is building a manufacturing facility in Salem,
Oregon, that will eventually pump out 10,000 bi-pedal robots a year.

 ‚ÄòANIMATE ANYONE‚Äô HERALDS THE APPROACH OF FULL-MOTION DEEPFAKES (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Animate Anyone uses a generative video technique to create videos
from pictures of people. While its results are far from perfect, the
model is a huge leap over the previous state of the art, which
produced way more artifacts or completely lost important details. The
team behind the model hasn't released the code for it yet. Videos
showing deepfakes made with Animate Anyone are available in the
article.

 INTRODUCING STYLEX (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 StyleX is an expressive, deterministic, reliable, and scalable
styling system. It was carefully designed to meet the requirements of
large application, reusable component libraries and statically typed
codebases. StyleX is fully typed and supports an expressive subset of
CSS. It takes the developer experience of CSS-in-JS libraries and uses
compile-time tooling to bridge it with the performance and scalability
of static CSS.

 THE INSIDE STORY OF MICROSOFT‚ÄôS PARTNERSHIP WITH OPENAI (58 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 This article covers what happened behind the scenes during OpenAI's
recent five-day crisis. It also looks at Microsoft's relationship with
OpenAI and the company's history with AI. Microsoft's CTO Kevin Scott,
the person most responsible for forging the OpenAI partnership,
believes that AI is one of the most powerful things humans have ever
invented. It will take a lot of time to develop the technology, but it
could improve the quality of life for everyone. 

 REGRETFUL ACCELERATIONISM (21 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Internet can not be portrayed as a district development from a
world increasingly in turmoil. Removing the constraint of physical
distribution may have accelerated the development of many
technologies, but it also created many problems. An increasingly
AI-generated world where all content is customized for every
individual may help more people realize the only way to survive online
is to pay it increasingly little heed.
