 APPLE READIES ITS FIRST EVER TOUCH-SCREEN MACBOOK (4 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Apple is developing a MacBook Pro with a touch display for late 2026
or early 2027. The new machines will have thinner and lighter frames
and M6 chips. Their displays will use OLED technology, the same
standard used in iPhones and iPad Pros. Apple will be retiring the
notch and adopting a hole-punch design. The new MacBook Pros will
likely cost a few hundred dollars more than current versions because
of pricier components. 

 DOORDASH WILL USE WAYMO'S ROBOTAXIS FOR DELIVERY IN PHOENIX (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 DoorDash and Waymo have entered into a partnership that brings
Waymo's driverless Jaguar SUVs into DoorDash's delivery fleet. Waymo
will deliver orders from DoorDash's DashMart store starting in
Phoenix. It plans to add more restaurants, retail, and grocery stores
over time. Customers will have to go to the vehicle and unlock its
trunk with the DoorDash app to retrieve their orders.

 HELION RECEIVES APPROVALS FOR NEXT PHASE OF CONSTRUCTION OF WORLD'S
FIRST COMMERCIAL FUSION POWER PLANT (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Helion has been granted a Conditional Use Permit to start the next
phase of development for its commercial fusion power plant. This
clears the way for the construction of the fusion generator building
of the company's Orion fusion power plant in Malaga, Washington.
Helion plans to deliver electrons to the grid before the end of this
decade. The company's approach of rapid iteration and testing has
enabled it to make steady progress toward a commercial fusion power
plant. It was the first private fusion company to achieve 100 million
degrees Celsius plasma temperatures, generally considered the required
operating temperature for commercial fusion feasibility. 

 CHINA OVERCOMES KEY BARRIERS TO UNLOCKING ALL-SOLID-STATE EV
BATTERIES WITH 1,000 KM RANGE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Chinese scientists have achieved three breakthroughs that could be
key to unlocking all-solid-state batteries. The first is iodine ions,
which actively attract lithium ions in the interface between the
electrode and the electrolyte, plugging the gaps and enabling a better
bond. The second is a polymer material that can be bent 20,000 times
and twisted into a twist without breaking. The third is a type of
'shield' on the electrolyte surface that passes needle penetration
tests and can handle temperatures of over 120 degrees Celsius. The
breakthroughs could result in a 100-kilogram battery pack that
delivers over 1,000 kilometers of range.

 CLAUDE SKILLS ARE AWESOME, MAYBE A BIGGER DEAL THAN MCP (11 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Claude Skills are folders that include instructions, scripts, and
resources that Claude can load when needed to improve performance on
specific tasks. Each skill has a Markdown file telling the model how
to do something, optionally accompanied by extra documents and
pre-written scripts the model can run to help it accomplish tasks. At
the start of a session, Claude scans all available skill files and
reads a short explanation for each one, which is very token-efficient.
Skills are easy to share - the upcoming Cambrian explosion in Skills
will make the MCP rush look pedestrian by comparison. 

 HOW TO TAME A USER INTERFACE USING A SPREADSHEET (4 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Spreadsheets are one of the greatest user interface design tools ever
created. They allow designers to focus solely on layout positioning
and hierarchy without worrying about type sizes or software choices.
Spreadsheets can occupy as many dimensions as required by using
multiple sheets. This post provides some examples of layouts solved
using spreadsheets.

 HOW MUCH CAN TESLA PAY ELON MUSK? DELAWARE'S SUPREME COURT WILL
DECIDE (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Delaware Supreme Court heard the latest set of arguments over
Elon Musk's compensation package for Tesla on Wednesday. The pay
package could hypothetically be worth well over $100 billion as of
mid-October. A panel of justices will weigh whether the package was an
extraordinary move that reflected undue influence or inadequately
informed shareholders, or a properly conducted business decision.
Meanwhile, Tesla's board of directors has proposed a new, future
compensation package that could make Musk the world's first
trillionaire if fully realized. 

 YOUTUBE JUST ATE TV. IT'S ONLY GETTING STARTED (34 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 YouTube has grown from a user-generated circus into the most powerful
platform on Earth in two decades. The platform has become a dominant
force in media, and there are signs the company is close to breaking
through to the other hours people are spending on their TV sets.
YouTube has paid out more than $100 billion to its creators, artists,
and media partners over the past four years. Sports is in many ways
the final frontier for YouTube to conquer.
