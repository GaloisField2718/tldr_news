 GOOGLE ANNOUNCES GEMINI 3 AS BATTLE WITH OPENAI INTENSIFIES (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google's new Gemini 3 AI model allows users to get better answers to
more complex questions. It will be integrated into the Gemini app,
Google's AI search products, and the company's enterprise products.
Users will start seeing the rollout over the coming weeks. The model
is built to grasp depth and nuance, so it is much better at figuring
out context and intent behind requests. 

 ANTHROPIC VALUED IN RANGE OF $350 BILLION FOLLOWING INVESTMENT DEAL
WITH MICROSOFT, NVIDIA (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft has announced new partnerships with Nvidia and Anthropic.
Microsoft will invest up to $5 billion - and Nvidia up to $10 billion
- into Anthropic. Anthropic's valuation is now in the range of $350
billion. It has committed to purchasing $30 billion of Azure compute
capacity from Microsoft and has contracted for additional compute
capacity up to 1 gigawatt. It has also committed to purchasing up to 1
gigawatt of compute capacity with Nvidia's Grace Blackwell and Vera
Rubin systems.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SCIENTISTS PULL OFF QUANTUM TELEPORTATION BETWEEN PHOTONS FROM
DIFFERENT QUANTUM DOTS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers in Germany have demonstrated the first transfer of
quantum information between photons emitted by two different quantum
dots. The work is part of a project to build quantum repeaters that
fit into existing fiber networks. Any attempt to read or intercept
quantum communications leaves traces, making systems inherently
secure. The current setup teleports information with a success rate of
slightly above 70%. This could be improved by stabilizing the quantum
dots. 

 ROBOTAXIS AND SUBURBIA (25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When Uber first came onto the scene, it provided an entirely new
experience for both drivers and riders that was orthogonal to the taxi
market. This let it create a far larger market. Robotaxis could have
the same effect. The technology could result in the end of urbanism as
living in the suburbs becomes more convenient.

 PAY FOR TEST COVERAGE, NOT QA HOURS (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Scaling QA is hard to achieve purely in-house. QA Wolf is the
AI-native service [10] that lets you pay for test coverage, not labor
hours. Their automation-first approach delivers 5x faster tests, 15
minute QA cycles, human-verified bug reports, and 80% coverage in less
than 4 months. See how QA Wolf delivers results [10] 

 GEMINI 3 DEVELOPER GUIDE (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Gemini 3 is designed to bring any idea to life. This guide covers the
key features of the Gemini 3 model family and shows readers how to get
the most out of it. Gemini 3 Pro uses dynamic thinking by default -
for faster, low-latency responses, constrain the model's thinking
level to 'low'. There are some differences in the model that
developers should be aware of when migrating from Gemini 2.5. 

 MAKING THINGS TRUE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The most important moments in the history of computing were the
introduction of new primitives. The command line enabled composable
programs, the GUI gave users direct manipulation, the web linked
information together, and smartphones provided sensors and
connectivity. Each unlocked ecosystems because they provided new
primitives that could be infinitely recombined. AI is a new primitive
that allows us to decompose and recompose reality in new ways.

 MOST COMPANIES WILL SLOW ENTRY-LEVEL HIRING BECAUSE OF AI, SURVEY
SAYS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Two-thirds of organizations around the world expect to slow
entry-level hiring in the coming years. Employers are rapidly adopting
AI tools, and that automation is already changing or displacing roles
at scale. Most organizations say job responsibilities have shifted or
disappeared due to AI. Routine tasks have been most affected. Many
organizations are now focusing on broader communication, critical
thinking, and technical abilities over considering university degrees.


 META'S VICTORY OPENS THE WAY FOR SILICON VALLEY TO GO DEAL SHOPPING
(6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A federal judge ruled yesterday that Meta had not illegally stifled
competition when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade
ago. Meta may soon be able to resume buying young startups to stay
ahead of the pack. The ruling will eliminate a lot of the strange deal
structures that the major acquirers have been using and open up the
door for more deals.
