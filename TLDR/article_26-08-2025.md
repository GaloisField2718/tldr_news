TLDR 2025-08-26

 😘 KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native service provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for WEB AND MOBILE APPS, reducing your organization's QA
cycle from days to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

Engineering teams MOVE FASTER, releases stay on track, and testing
happens automatically—so developers can focus on building, not
debugging.

The result? Drata [6] achieved 4X MORE TEST CASES and 86% FASTER QA
CYCLES.

⭐ Rated 4.8/5 on G2.

 NVIDIA'S NEW ‘ROBOT BRAIN' GOES ON SALE FOR $3,499 AS COMPANY
TARGETS ROBOTICS FOR GROWTH (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Nvidia's Jetson AGX Thor robotics chip module is now on sale for
$3,499 as a developer kit. The first kits will ship next month. The
chips will allow customers to create robots that run generative AI
models. They can also be used for self-driving cars. The Jetson Thor
chips are based on Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processor, which is
also used in the company's current generation of AI chips and chips
for computer games. 

 GOOGLE WILL BLOCK SIDELOADING OF UNVERIFIED ANDROID APPS STARTING
NEXT YEAR (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google has announced plans to begin verifying the identities of all
Android app developers, no matter where they offer their content. Apps
without verification will stop working on most Android devices in the
coming years. The company plans to create a streamlined Android
Developer Console that devs can use if they plan to distribute apps
outside of the Play Store. Google won't check the content or
functionality of apps outside of the Play Store.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 ULTRARAM SCALED FOR VOLUME PRODUCTION (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 UltraRAM promises DRAM-like speeds, 4,000x the durability of NAND,
and data retention for up to a thousand years. Quinas Technology and
IQE have successfully developed a scalable process for producing
UltraRAM. The companies are now weighing pilot production with various
foundries and other collaborators. 

 BUILDING ULTRA CHEAP ENERGY STORAGE FOR SOLAR PV (32 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Standard Thermal is a company that aims to make energy from solar PV
available at all times at a price that is competitive with US natural
gas. The company's technology works by storing energy as heat in large
piles of dirt. Electric heating elements embedded in the dirt convert
electricity to heat, and pipes carrying fluid remove the heat to
supply customers. The capital cost is comparable to natural gas
storage at less than $0.10 per kilowatt-hour thermal and a thousand
times cheaper than batteries. Standard Thermal's system can provide
hundreds of megawatts of thermal demand as long as land is available.

 WICKED PYTHON TRICKERY - DYNAMICALLY PATCH A PYTHON FUNCTION'S SOURCE
CODE AT RUNTIME (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 It's possible to dynamically change a function's source code at run
time in Python using the compile and exec functions. This technique
enables developers to build more flexible AI bots that can generate
and execute code with access to the current environment. However, it
also raises some serious security concerns. This post walks readers
through how the technique works and the real security concerns with
using the approach. 

 PREDICTION-ENCODED PIXELS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Prediction-Encoded Pixels is a format specifically designed for
low-color pixel art. It uses 'Prediction by Partial Matching, Order-2'
compression, which is able to compress packed-palette-indices smaller
than GIF, PNG, and QOI. It's two to 10 times slower than GIF/PNG/QOI,
depending on the image, but it often compresses images 20% to 50%
smaller than GIF/PNG, and multiple times smaller than QOI. The format
is still in an experimental phase.

 PREDICTING OUR OWN DEMISE (13 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Prediction markets don't provide better predictions about the future.
The best, most efficient financial markets have standardized products,
many participants, low transaction costs, and heterogeneous
participants. Prediction markets lack participants with heterogeneous
risk preferences. It's also possible for participants to manipulate
some outcomes. Prediction markets are bad market design, and they
induce bad incentives, so we should put the genie back in the box
while there's still time. 

 INSIDE INTEL'S TRICKY DANCE WITH TRUMP (15 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 President Donald Trump told Lip-Bu Tan, Intel's chief executive, to
step down five months into his tenure because of his past ties to the
Chinese military. Tan eventually smoothed things over with Trump, but
at a cost: in return for his support, the administration converted
nearly $9 billion in grants promised to Intel as part of the 2022
Chips Act into a 10% equity stake in the company. The US government is
now Intel's biggest shareholder. Tan still needs to resolve core
business challenges to get Intel back on track. Without new
commitments from customers, converting government grants to stock will
only leave the company in a worse financial shape by diluting
shareholders.
