 SHOPIFY PARTNERS WITH COINBASE AND STRIPE IN LANDMARK STABLECOIN DEAL
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Shopify is rolling out stablecoin payments to all users on its
platform later this year. Merchants will be able to set up their own
online marketplaces and accept payments in USDC, a stablecoin issued
by Circle. Access will be gradually expanded across the US and Europe
before being opened up to all users. Shopify worked with Coinbase and
collaborated with Stripe to develop new payment protocols and
integrate stablecoins into its existing software stack.

MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has unveiled new details about its
next-generation AI chips. The Instinct MI400 series will ship next
year. They can be assembled into full server racks with thousands of
chips. AMD's rack-scale setup will make the chips look to users like
one system, which is important for most customers who develop large
language models.

 EXPERIMENTAL RETINA IMPLANTS GIVE MICE INFRARED VISION (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Chinese scientists recently built prototype retinal implants that can
replace failing photoreceptors and potentially provide infrared vision
as a bonus. They work without an external camera or power source. The
implants have been tested in mice and non-human primates - results in
mice seemed promising, with the blind mice in the study responding to
light and seemingly being able to see near-infrared wavelengths as
well. The implants let the primates see infrared light, but their
normal vision appeared unchanged. 

 BIOENGINEERED TOOTH "GROWS" IN PLACE TO LOOK AND FEEL LIKE THE REAL
THING (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have developed an artificial tooth implant that 'grows'
into the gums and fuses with existing nerves to mimic the form and
function of a real tooth. They can be put in place without any bone
drilling. The artificial tooth features a biodegradable outer layer
that contains stem cells and specific proteins that trigger the cells
to mature into nerve tissue. This allows the implant to 'talk' to the
brain, much like a real tooth, allowing the tooth to sense things like
food texture and temperature.

 AGENTIC CODING RECOMMENDATIONS (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Agentic coding is evolving rapidly. This post describes an agentic
workflow - while it might be quickly outdated, it shows how
integrating agents in the development processes can unlock significant
productivity gains. While tools and techniques will evolve, the core
principles remain essential. The goal isn't just to leverage agents to
write code faster, but to write better, more maintainable, and
resilient code. 

 SUPPRESSIONS OF SUPPRESSIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Developers will sometimes need to suppress rules in build processes
because those rules are wrong or unnecessarily strict. However, as
people get used to suppressing rules, they might run into another
problem - some rules are really bad to suppress as suppressing them
might cause unforeseen issues. One way to deal with suppressions is to
introduce a lint rule that forbids developers from suppressing some
other lint rules.

 WAYMO RIDES COST MORE THAN UBER OR LYFT — AND PEOPLE ARE PAYING
ANYWAY (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Waymo's self-driving car rides are consistently more expensive
compared to offerings from Uber and Lyft. The company's average price
at peak hours is about $11 more expensive than Lyft and nearly $9.50
pricier than Uber. The price difference shows excitement for the
technology and a real preference to sometimes be in a car without a
driver. Shorter trips tend to cost more than longer ones - the pricing
gap shrinks as rides get longer.
