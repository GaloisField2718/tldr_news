 TESLA PLANS TO BUILD NEW ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN MID-2025 (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Tesla has told suppliers it wants to start production of a new
electric vehicle in mid-2025. Codenamed 'Redwood', the next-generation
vehicle is expected to drive a new wave of growth. Tesla has
forecasted a weekly production volume of 10,000 vehicles. The new
vehicle may be the entry-level $25,000 car that Elon Musk first
promised to build in 2020. Tesla plans to make an inexpensive robotaxi
based on the same vehicle architecture as the $25,000 electric car. 

 GOOGLE‚ÄôS LATEST AI VIDEO GENERATOR CAN RENDER CUTE ANIMALS IN
IMPLAUSIBLE SITUATIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Lumiere is an AI video generator that uses a space-time diffusion
model for realistic video generation. The Space-Time U-Net
architecture that it uses generates the entire temporal duration of a
video at once with a single pass. It is designed to handle both where
things are and how things move and change throughout a video. Lumiere
can perform text-to-video generation, convert still images into
videos, generate videos in specific styles using a reference image,
apply consistent video editing using text-based prompts, create
cinemagraphs, and inpaint videos. It excels in creating videos of cute
animals in ridiculous scenarios - examples are available in the
article.

 CHINA'S NEW DARK MATTER LAB IS BIGGEST AND DEEPEST YET (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The world's deepest and largest underground laboratory is around
2,400 meters below the Jinping Mountains in southwest China. The
enormous space, with a sprawling capacity of 330,000 cubic meters, is
home to scientists studying dark matter, a hypothetical substance
thought to make up more than 80% of the mass in the Universe. It
opened in 2010 but only became operational in December 2023. The
layers of rock above the laboratory shield it from background noise
such as cosmic rays. 

 CHILDREN WITH GENETIC DEAFNESS HAVE HEARING RESTORED WITH GENE
THERAPY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Five children with a form of genetic deafness called DFNB9 regained
their hearing thanks to a new type of gene therapy. The therapy
involves the use of an inactive virus carrying a functioning version
of the gene associated with the disease. The children, who were
previously totally deaf, recovered their hearing and were able to
conduct normal conversations. Further studies will enroll more
patients and follow them for a longer period of time to ensure that
the treatment works.

 MAKING RUST BINARIES SMALLER BY DEFAULT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cargo by default now uses `strip = 'debuginfo'` for the `release`
profile unless debuginfo is explicitly requested for some dependency.
This new default will be used for any profile that does not enable
debuginfo anywhere in its dependency chain. This article looks at how
a developer noticed that Rust binaries were unnecessarily large and
then developed and submitted a fix for it. 

 PROMPTS ARE TINY PROGRAMS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Prompt engineering is just a subset of software engineering. Prompts
are tiny programs written in natural language. Guessing the right
'function calls' with the clever use of vocabulary is a huge part of
the game as the API isn't specified and varies between models.
Thinking of prompts as code allows prompt engineers to generate
model-aware syntax highlighters for favored keywords.

 A LEAKED MEMO FROM GOOGLE CEO SUNDAR PICHAI COMES AMIDST EMPLOYEE
DISCONTENT (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A leaked memo from Google's CEO Sundar Pichai revealed the company's

personal computing platforms and devices; enable organizations and
developers to innovate on Google Cloud; provide the world's most

 SELF-DRIVING AS A CASE STUDY FOR AGI (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is commonly defined as an
autonomous system that surpasses human capabilities in the majority of
economically valuable work. Recent developments in autonomous driving
present a good early case study of the societal dynamics of increasing
automation. Driving is a difficult problem to automate and its
automation will impact a large human workforce. The autonomous driving
industry has created many new jobs that didn't exist before. Instead
of destroying jobs, automation caused the industry to adapt and
change.
