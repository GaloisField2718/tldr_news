 SAM ALTMAN'S WORLD UNVEILS A MOBILE VERIFICATION DEVICE (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Tools for Humanity, the startup behind the World human verification
project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has unveiled a mobile
device designed to help people determine the difference between humans
and AI agents. The Orb Mini looks like a smartphone, but it has two
large sensors on the front to scan users' eyeballs. The data is used
to create a unique identifier on the blockchain to verify that users
are human. It is still unclear what the ultimate functionality of the
Orb Mini will be, but its current main purpose is to verify more
people. 

 CHINESE ROBOT DOES JOB OF THREE TO FOUR HUMANS INSTALLING THOUSANDS
OF PANELS AT AUSTRALIAN SOLAR PROJECT (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Chinese tech company Leapting's AI-controlled robot successfully
helped install 10,000 solar modules at its first commercial deployment
in Australia. The 2.5-meter-high robotic arm sits on a crawler that
can adapt to different terrain and environmental conditions. Its use
increased efficiency by three to five times compared to manual
operations. The robot will be deployed to another Australian solar
farm to start work in May to install around 500,000 panels.

 DATAFRAMELY (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Dataframely is a Python package for validating the schema and content
of 'polars' data frames. It is aimed at making data pipelines more
robust, by ensuring that data meets expectations, and more readable,
by adding schema information to data frame type hints. It can be used
to declaratively define schemas as classes with arbitrary inheritance
structures, specify column-specific validation rules, validate data
frames, integrate schemas with external tools, and much more.

 JUDGE REBUKES APPLE AND ORDERS IT TO LOOSEN GRIP ON APP STORE (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A US federal judge has ruled that Apple must loosen its grip on its
App Store and stop collecting a commission on some app sales. Apple
was previously ordered to allow apps to provide users with external
links to pay developers directly for services to avoid the 30%
commission Apple charges. The company instead created a new system
that forced apps with external sales to pay a 27% commission to the
company and also created pop-up screens that discouraged customers
from paying elsewhere. Apple is now restricted from taking commissions
from sales outside the App Store and from displaying messages
discouraging users from making external purchases. It is being
investigated for criminal contempt. 

 SOMETHING ALARMING IS HAPPENING TO THE JOB MARKET (5 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Labor conditions for recent college graduates have deteriorated
noticeably in the past few months. Unemployment now stands at an
unusually high 5.8%. This could be the signal of short-term economic
drag, medium-term changes to the value of a college degree, or
long-term changes to the relationship between people and AI. Today's
graduates are entering into an uncertain economy where some businesses
are so focused on tomorrow's profit margin that they're less willing
to hire workers who will take time to learn on the job.
