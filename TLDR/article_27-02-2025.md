 AMAZON'S SUBSCRIPTION-BASED ALEXA+ LOOKS HIGHLY CAPABLE—AND
QUESTIONABLE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Amazon will start rolling out its more capable and conversational
version of Alexa to US Prime members for free in the next few weeks.
Alexa+ will be available to non-Prime subscribers for $20 a month.
Amazon has not specified a release date but noted that availability
will start with the Echo Show 8, 10, 15, and 21 smart displays. Alexa+
will be compatible with tens of thousands of other devices and
services at launch - Amazon trained it to use partner APIs and it has
agentic abilities for apps that don't have a full set of external
APIs. 

 INSTAGRAM MAY LAUNCH SEPARATE REELS APP TO TAKE ON TIKTOK (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Instagram is reportedly considering launching a separate Reels app
focused on short-form video. TikTok's future remains uncertain in the
US. President Trump has granted an extension to comply with the law
that requires a sale or ban of the platform and floated the
possibility of a joint venture between the US and ByteDance, but there
are few details on how that might work. The law was enacted due to
arguments that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and
political manipulation.

 AUTOMATTIC'S “NUCLEAR WAR” OVER WORDPRESS ACCESS SPARKS POTENTIAL
CLASS ACTION (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Automattic and its founder Matt Mullenweg may face a potential class
action lawsuit claiming that they deliberately abused their power and
control over the WordPress ecosystem to purposefully and repeatedly
disrupt contracts. The class would include all persons in the US who
had ongoing active WPE WordPress Web Hosting plans on or before
September 24, 2024, through to December 10, 2024. The lawsuit warns
that the entire internet as a whole could be harmed due to Automattic
withholding access to open source software anytime a company doesn't
cave into payment demands. 

 NVIDIA'S AI BOOM BRINGS RICHES TO PARTNERS LIKE DELL, AT A COST (6
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Dell's $5 billion deal to supply servers to xAI is an immense win for
the computer seller, but the deal only has a narrow margin of
profitability. People familiar with the deal say that the deal is
expected to yield gross margins only in the mid-single-digits
percentage. Nvidia has expanded its product range, reducing
opportunities for companies like Dell to bundle higher-margin items.
The company's massive leverage is likely to continue at least until
rival chipmakers launch competing products.
