 TESLA GIGA SHANGHAI TO RELEASE 2024 MODEL Y REFRESH AS COMPETITION
HEATS UP IN CHINA (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla is already preparing to produce the 2024 refresh Model Y at
Gigafactory Shanghai, with mass production expected to start by
mid-2024. The refresh will have significant changes compared to the
updated units released in October 2023. The new Model Y will have more
noticeable changes to the exterior and interior to compete with new
electric car units to be released in China next year. It is expected
to feature a new wheel design with ambient lighting. 

 4-YEAR CAMPAIGN BACKDOORED IPHONES USING POSSIBLY THE MOST ADVANCED
EXPLOIT EVER (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers have discovered an attack that backdoored possibly
thousands of iPhones over four years. Many of the affected phones
belonged to Moscow-based security firm Kaspersky. The attackers were
able to achieve an unprecedented level of access by exploiting a
vulnerability in an undocumented hardware feature that few people know
of. It is still unknown how they became aware of the feature. The
exploit was delivered through iMessage texts which installed malware
without requiring the receiver to take any action. Apple has patched
the exploit, which also affected Macs, iPods, iPads, Apple TVs, and
Apple Watches.

 SCIENTISTS DISCOVER THE FIRST NEW ANTIBIOTICS IN OVER 60 YEARS USING
AI (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scientists have discovered a new class of antibiotics for
drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria using AI. The
discovery could be a turning point in the fight against antibiotic
resistance. Deep learning is increasingly being applied in drug
discovery to accelerate the process. The model was able to predict the
activity and toxicity of the new compound. 

 INJECTION OF ‚ÄúSMART INSULIN‚Äù REGULATES BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS FOR
ONE WEEK (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Glucose-responsive insulin, or 'smart' insulin, is a form of insulin
that provides control of blood glucose levels over a longer period of
time than normal insulin. A recent study reported that a single
injection of a smart insulin system was able to regulate blood glucose
levels in diabetic mice and minipigs for a week. The system mimics the
body's natural process, releasing insulin in response to glucose.
Research into smart insulin is still in its early stages, but the
study demonstrated that it could be a viable research subject heading
forward.

 FONTIMIZE (32 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Fontimize is a Python library for subsetting fonts. It can cut the
size of font files by around 95%, resulting in saved bandwidth.
Fontimize's Magic Method generates new versions of fonts with only the
glyphs needed to render the specific website. It features a flexible
API and command-line utility that allows users to customize output
locations, use specific font files, change verbosity, return
information about what characters were found and what fonts were
generated, and more. 

 TBMK (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Tbmk is a commands bookmark for the terminal. It allows users to
search, add, edit, and delete commands. Tbmk has been tested on Linux
bash and zsh. A video demo is available.

 MY CCPA DIALOG WITH OPENAI (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article contains an exchange with OpenAI following the filing of
a CCPA request. The aim of the filing was to see how large language
models might comply with privacy regulations like the CCPA and GDPR
when it comes to their training data sets. While OpenAI never really
settled the original CCPA request, the exchange illuminated its
approach to privacy and training data. It appears OpenAI is currently
using the hallucination excuse to handle privacy requests, and while
they are releasing products at a truly impressive pace, it doesn't
seem that legal and support are keeping up. 

 BIG TECH IS SPENDING MORE THAN VC FIRMS ON AI STARTUPS (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Big Tech companies have vastly outspent venture capital firms with
generative AI startup investments this year. Microsoft, Google, and
Amazon are responsible for two-thirds of the $27 billion raised by AI
startups in 2023. Building and training generative AI tools is
expensive and requires immense computing power, so startups have
preferred to partner with Big Tech companies that can provide
infrastructure and funds. This has rapidly pushed up the valuations of
private startups, making it harder for VCs to invest in the most
cutting-edge companies.
