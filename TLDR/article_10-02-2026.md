 IMPROVED STRENGTH FOR ALL SEASONS (SPONSOR) [4]

weakness.

mitochondrial function and healthy aging. This longevity breakthrough
tackles the root cause of aging at the foundation by directly renewing
your cellular energy centers. The result is increased muscle strength,

 SAM ALTMAN TOUTS CHATGPT'S REACCELERATING GROWTH TO EMPLOYEES AS
OPENAI CLOSES IN ON $100 BILLION FUNDING (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sam Altman told employees on Friday that ChatGPT is back to exceeding
10% monthly growth. The company is preparing to launch an updated Chat
model this week. OpenAI has officially begun testing ads within
ChatGPT. The company expects ads to make up less than half of its
revenue long term. Fundraising talks are expected to heat up over the
next two weeks. 

 AIRPODS PRO 4 COULD FEATURE CAMERAS TO 'SEE AROUND YOU' (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The next AirPods Pro will be able to see its surroundings to provide
hand gesture recognition and create an enhanced spatial audio
experience with the Apple Vision Pro headset. They will be released at
the same $249 price as the current model. Apple tends to wait around
three years to make major changes to AirPods, so it is unclear whether
the company plans to release a new high-end version of the AirPods Pro
3 or a full-fledged AirPods Pro 4. All AirPods announcements so far
have been made at Apple's annual iPhone event in September.

 WHY WOULD ELON MUSK PIVOT FROM MARS TO THE MOON ALL OF A SUDDEN? (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX is pivoting its focus from building a settlement on Mars to
building a 'self-growing' city on the Moon. Elon Musk says that a Moon
settlement could be achieved in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would
take more than 20 years. SpaceX was founded with the original goal of
settling Mars. However, focusing on the Moon, SpaceX is making a
decision that benefits NASA and the US. 

 DECODING CHINA'S NEW SPACE PHILOSOPHY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 China recently released a plan that lays out its priorities for 2026
through 2030 that contains plenty of ambitious goals for the space
sector. The country plans to harvest water from space in the
not-too-distant future, with the next five years focused on tech demos
on things like robot drills and in-orbit processing. China's plans
mention building gigawatt-level space digital infrastructure. It also
has the beginnings of a new space tourism industry.

 WRITE-ONLY CODE (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 We are moving toward a future where a large amount of production code
will never be read by a human. This Write-Only Code future will happen
when software production scales beyond human attention. The
organizations that will succeed in this transition will be the ones
that invest early in new primitives for trust, accountability, and
control. Refusing to adapt will ensure adaptation happens
accidentally, under pressure, and without intent. 

 OPUS 4.6, CODEX 5.3, AND THE POST-BENCHMARK ERA (10 MINUTE READ) [11]


 OpenAI and Anthropic both recently unveiled the next iterations of
their coding assistants. Benchmarks are getting less and less
meaningful as coding assistants get better. Over time, the industry
will develop better ways of articulating the differences in agentic
models, but for now, people will have to experience them for
themselves, or read other people's experiences about them, to track
frontier models. Consistent testing and clear articulation will be the
only way to monitor the pace of progress in agentic capabilities in
the near future.

 REDDIT SAYS 80 MILLION PEOPLE NOW USE ITS SEARCH WEEKLY (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 80 million people are now using Reddit search every week after Reddit
merged its core search with its AI-powered Reddit Answers. People are
now starting and completing searches on the platform without ever
touching Google. Reddit is now the most-cited source in AI-generated

into Reddit communities, where they can read discussions, ask
follow-up questions, and participate.
