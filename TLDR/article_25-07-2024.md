 THE WORLD INCREASINGLY RUNS ON LITHIUM. THIS COMPANY IS OFFERING
INVESTORS A CHANCE TO OWN A STAKE IN POWERING THE FUTURE (SPONSOR) [4]


 With governments and auto companies racing to switch to renewables,
electric vehicles will soon be the only cars - and almost all of them
run on lithium batteries.

Not since the invention of the steam engine has a fuel technology
promised such a globally transformative impact - and presented such an
investment opportunity [4].

U.S. DoE and General Motors-Backed EnergyX [4] has designed patented
technology [4] that can extract up to 300% more lithium than
traditional methods. Predicted to dominate extraction in the near
future, huge excitement has surrounded the launch of their most recent
open-to-the-public investment round. [4]

This century will be defined by lithium. Don't miss your chance to
invest in the future. [4]

beta, has most of the functions of the iOS version of the app. It is
currently only available in English and is compatible with Safari and

 REDDIT NOW BLOCKS ALL SEARCH ENGINES OTHER THAN GOOGLE FOLLOWING
‚ÄòMISUSE' (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Reddit has started to block its site from appearing in search engines
other than Google. The site has updated its robots.txt file to block
all bots from scraping any part of it. It claims the change was being
made following an increase in commercial entities scraping the site.
Reddit and Google announced a new deal earlier this year allowing
Google to use Reddit data to train AI models.

 AUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTS GENETICALLY ENGINEER COMMON FLY SPECIES TO EAT
MORE OF HUMANITY'S WASTE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Australian scientists have genetically engineered black soldier flies
to eat organic waste and produce ingredients for making everything
from lubricants to biofuels to high-grade animal feeds. The fly larvae
can eat double their body weight a day, consuming waste faster than
microbes. They are harvested once they turn into pupae. The scientists
have created a company to commercialize their work - they hope to have
their first genetically engineered flies for use in waste facilities
by the end of the year. 

 TEST FLIGHT DEMONSTRATES NAVIGATION BY CELLPHONE SIGNALS (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 There are many natural and man-made threats that could knock out
Earth's global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). There were
numerous aviation-related incidents from the Baltic to the Atlantic to
the Mediterranean Sea in 2024. The US Air Force has a novel backup
system that uses cellphone towers to calculate a plane's position. The
system is able to track planes for horizontal distances of more than a
hundred kilometers at altitudes up to 23,000 feet with precision in
single-digit meters.

 DEVELOPERS WANT MORE, MORE, MORE: THE 2024 RESULTS FROM STACK
OVERFLOW'S ANNUAL DEVELOPER SURVEY (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article discusses the results of the 14th annual Stack Overflow
Developer Survey. This year's most popular technologies are JavaScript
and PostgreSQL. Rust and Markdown are the most admired. Developers are
frustrated with technical debt at work, but they don't see AI as a
threat. While most developers use or plan to use AI tools, many don't
trust the accuracy of the technology. 

 WILL FIGMA BECOME AN AWKWARD MIDDLE GROUND? (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Designers who can code are more likely to sketch out their ideas than
use Figma. AI will make this workflow more accessible to those who
can't code. This will cause Figma to fall into an awkward middle
ground. Figma has its users because it takes most people too long to
code their designs - AI can turn wireframes into frontend code,
extrapolate design systems, and create visuals from screenshots and
mood boards. This may cause designers to skip using tools like Figma
on the road to shipping software.

 IT'S OFFICIAL: INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE VOTES TO CONFIRM THE
FIRST OLYMPIC ESPORTS GAMES WILL HAPPEN IN 2025, EVEN IF THEY DON'T
KNOW THE GAMES YET (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The first-ever Olympic Esports Games will be held in 2025. The games
are planned for an initial run of 12 years, with events held
regularly. They will remain distinct from the Olympic Games in both
financing and organization. The International Olympic Committee will
now begin work on selecting a host city, venues, dates, and games for
the event. 

 THE AI JOB INTERVIEWER WILL SEE YOU NOW (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI job interviews have grown in popularity. The industry is still
small and the jobs affected are often large-scale roles where
companies need to sift through thousands of applicants at once.
Companies in favor of the practice claim that it is less biased as the
systems assess candidates on merit without prejudice or mood affecting
the decision. Critics say that bias can creep in through the training
data. Some candidates are turning to AI themselves - entrepreneurs are
now peddling AI services to help people answer interview questions in
real time.
