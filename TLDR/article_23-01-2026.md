 KAGGLE LAUNCHES COMMUNITY BENCHMARKS FOR ANYONE TO BUILD THEIR OWN AI
EVALS (SPONSOR) [4]

models AT NO COST. 

Community Benchmarks [4] enable you to build evaluations easily. With

for multimodal inputs/outputs, tool use, and an easy-to-use interface,
you can start building right away!

 BUILD AN AGENT INTO ANY APP WITH THE GITHUB COPILOT SDK (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 GitHub Copilot SDK allows developers to embed the same agentic core
that powers GitHub Copilot CLI into any application. It provides
programmatic access to the same production-tested execution loop, so
developers don't have to manage context across turns, orchestrate
tools and commands, route between models, integrate MCP servers, or
think through permissions, safety boundaries, and failure modes. The
SDK also provides support for multiple AI models, custom tool
definitions, GitHub authentication, and real-time streaming. It is now
available in technical preview.
