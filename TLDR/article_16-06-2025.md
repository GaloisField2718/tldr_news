 WALMART AND AMAZON ARE EXPLORING ISSUING THEIR OWN STABLECOINS (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Several multinational giants, including Walmart and Amazon, are
discussing potential efforts to issue stablecoins. Whether these
initiatives will go ahead depends on a bill still yet to clear the
Senate and House called the Genius Act, which establishes a regulatory
framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins could allow merchants to bypass
traditional payment rails, which cost them billions of dollars in fees
each year. A regulatory framework for stablecoins would enable an
alternative payment type for merchants that could significantly lower
their expenses and create competition against Visa and Mastercard. 

 ANNE WOJCICKI WINS BIDDING FOR 23ANDME (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and former CEO of 23andMe, has been named
as the new buyer for the company's assets. Biotech company Regeneron
won the bidding last month during a bankruptcy auction but bidding
reopened earlier this month after Wojcicki's nonprofit, TTAM Research
Institute, made an unsolicited offer. Regeneron declined to submit a
higher bid based on its assessment of the company's value. If the sale
goes through, 23andMe's equity holders could recover some of their
investment in the company, a relative rarity in bankruptcy.

 SOLAR ORBITER GETS WORLD-FIRST VIEWS OF THE SUN'S POLES (11 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The European Space Agency-led Solar Orbiter spacecraft has imaged the
Sun's poles from outside the ecliptic plane. The spacecraft's unique
viewing angle will help scientists better understand the Sun's
magnetic field, the solar cycle, and the workings of space weather.
The complete dataset from Solar Orbiter's first full pole-to-pole
flight past the Sun is expected to arrive on Earth by October 2025. A
video of the Sun from an angle of 17 degrees below the solar equator -
enough to deficiently see the Sun's south pole - is available in the
article. 

 ONCE-A-WEEK PILL FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA SHOWS PROMISE IN CLINICAL TRIALS
(6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lyndra Therapeutics has created a once-a-week pill for treating the
symptoms of schizophrenia. The pill contains a widely used medication
for managing the disease. A phase 3 clinical trial conducted by Lyndra
Therapeutics showed that the patients who took the once-a-week pill
maintained consistent levels of the medication just as well as daily
doses of the drug. Making the drug easier to administer makes it
easier to ensure that patients are receiving their medication.

 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING TALENT IS GOLD RIGHT NOW (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The software engineering job market is currently in a pretty bad
place. Despite this, software engineers have the unique ability to
provide extraordinary leverage and productivity with the right
attitude. It's now easier than ever to automate tedious and formulaic
tasks. Anyone with software engineering skills can now take an
annoying problem, write a prompt, then let AI create a solution.

 I CONVINCED HP'S BOARD TO BUY PALM FOR $1.2B. THEN I WATCHED THEM
KILL IT IN 49 DAYS (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Phil McKinney convinced HP's board to acquire Palm for $1.2 billion
in early 2010 by demonstrating to the board how Palm's WebOS
represented a breakthrough platform technology that could
differentiate HP in the emerging mobile computing market. A few months
after the acquisition, HP's CEO was replaced and McKinney faced a
medical emergency that required immediate surgery and an eight-week
recovery period confined to bed. During his time in recovery, McKinney
was unable to participate in meetings or provide strategic input,
resulting in the entire mobile computing landscape at HP unraveling as
the new CEO brought a completely different strategic vision. HP ended
up discontinuing all WebOS devices just 49 days after it launched the
TouchPad. 

 ASK HN: IS AGEISM IN TECH STILL A PROBLEM? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [12] 

 Ageism has been a problem in tech for many years, and it doesn't look
like that has changed. While age brings many positive qualities in
terms of skill set, companies may be reluctant to hire older workers
as their salary demands are higher and they have stronger work
boundaries. Their seniority and directness can also intimidate younger
managers and other workers. Younger workers are more likely to be
flexible and build whatever without question, which is valuable for
business owners.
