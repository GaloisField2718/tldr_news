 APPLE DEVELOPING AIRTAG-SIZED AI PIN WITH DUAL CAMERAS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Apple is reportedly working on a small, wearable AI pin equipped with
multiple cameras, a speaker, and microphones. It will likely run the
new Siri chatbot the company plans to unveil in iOS 27. Apple wants
the final version of the pin to be about the same size as an AirTag
but slightly thicker. The AI pin could be released as soon as 2027,
but development is still in the early stages, and the product could be
canceled. 

 APPLE TO REVAMP SIRI AS A BUILT-IN IPHONE, MAC CHATBOT TO FEND OFF
OPENAI (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple plans to revamp Siri later this year by turning it into an AI
chatbot. The chatbot will be embedded deeply into the company's
operating systems and replace the current Siri interface. The feature
is a central piece of Apple's AI strategy. Apple has designed the
chatbot so that its underlying models can be swapped out over time.
The company will initially use Google-powered systems.

 JEFF BEZOS' BLUE ORIGIN LAUNCHES SATELLITE INTERNET SERVICE TO RIVAL
SPACEX, AMAZON (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blue Origin plans to deploy 5,408 satellites into space to launch a
communications network to take on SpaceX. Its TeraWave network will be
targeted at enterprise, data center, and government users. It will
provide data speeds of up to 6 terabits per second. Blue Origin
expects to start deploying its constellation in the fourth quarter of
next year. 

 OPERATING ON DNA IS MORE LIKE SURGERY THAN MEDICINE (11 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Last February, a team of doctors and scientists treated a baby with
severe CPS1 deficiency, a condition caused by a rare single-gene
mutation that causes patients' blood to be flooded with ammonia that
the liver can't clear. The doctors sequenced the baby's DNA, designed
a custom gene editor to fix the typo in his CPS1 gene, manufactured it
on demand, and infused it into his bloodstream. The process took about
six months and cost less than $1 million. Today, the baby is thriving
and seemingly cured.

 DESIGNING AI-RESISTANT TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Evaluating technical candidates is becoming harder as AI capabilities
improve. Each new model forces companies to redesign tests. This post
describes one company's original take-home design, how each Claude
model defeated it, and the increasingly unusual approaches the company
has had to take to ensure its tests stay ahead of top models'
capabilities. As work evolves alongside models, companies need to
develop increasingly creative ways to find strong engineers. 

 PANDAS 3.0.0 (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 pandas 3.0.0 includes some new features, bug fixes, and performance
improvements, as well as possible breaking changes. It removes a
functionality that was deprecated in previous releases. Users are
recommended to first upgrade to pandas 2.3 and to ensure their code is
working without warnings before upgrading to pandas 3.0. A link to a
list of all the changes in the release is available.

 THE FOR YOU PAGE IS KILLING SOCIAL (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 X is struggling with two incompatible goals: optimizing attention and
time spent on the platform, and tight creator-follow linkage. So far,
X has opted to chase KPIs like user time spent on the platform. This
has resulted in creators unable to consistently reach their audience,
consumers not hearing from creators they want to follow, and filter
bubbles like Crypto Twitter. Either creators and users are tightly
linked, or the platform algorithmically serves users an array of
compelling content - you can't have both. 

 WHY ELON MUSK IS RACING TO TAKE SPACEX PUBLIC (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The rush to build AI data centers prompted Elon Musk to propose
putting them in space. Musk has become obsessed with the idea of
SpaceX being the first to do it, but such a feat would be hard to
attempt and would require the billions of dollars in capital an
initial public offering could deliver. A SpaceX IPO could also help
xAI catch up to rivals. SpaceX is expected to collect banks to lead
the stock offering soon, with the IPO expected to be completed by
July.
