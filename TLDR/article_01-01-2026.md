 AUTHENTICITY AFTER ABUNDANCE (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Creation tools are getting better and better. This will make creators
matter more. Those who have the ability to be real, to connect, and to
have a voice that can't be faked will be those who succeed in this new
world. The bar will shift from whether someone can create to whether
someone can create something that only they could create. Only the
creators who can maintain trust and signal authenticity will stand
out. 

 RATHER THAN FULLY CRACKING DOWN ON SCAM ADS, META WORKED TO MAKE THEM
HARDER TO FIND (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta took steps to make scam ads less discoverable to regulators,
investigators, and journalists due to fears that Japanese regulators
would require advertiser verification, a measure the company estimated
would cost roughly $2 billion to implement and potentially reduce
revenue by nearly 5%. The campaign was so successful that Meta added
the tactic to a 'general global playbook' that has since been deployed
against regulatory scrutiny in other markets. Meta had previously
estimated that 10% of its 2024 revenue was from ads tied to scams and
banned goods.

 TESLA FSD SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES FULL COAST-TO-COAST DRIVE WITH ZERO
INTERVENTIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A Tesla owner successfully drove coast-to-coast across the US on Full
Self-Driving (FSD) Supervised with zero interventions during the trip.
Their Model 3 completed the drive in 2 days and 20 hours, starting at
the Tesla Diner in Los Angeles, CA, and ending in Myrtle Beach, SC. It
was accomplished with Tesla FSD V14.2 on AI4 hardware. The milestone
trip was widely lauded by members of the Tesla community. 

 NEURALINK WILL START HIGH-VOLUME PRODUCTION OF BRAIN-COMPUTER
INTERFACE DEVICES IN 2026 (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Neuralink received FDA breakthrough device designation for its speech
restoration in 2025. The company also launched clinical trials in the
Middle East and the UK, and completed two surgeries in Canada. It
upgraded its surgical robot to be able to insert an electrode thread
every 1.5 seconds at insertion depths of over 50mm. The threads go
through the dura without the need to remove it. Neuralink plans to
move to an almost completely automated surgical procedure this year.

 HOW I CODE WITH AGENTS, WITHOUT BEING 'TECHNICAL' (18 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Ben Tossell, who works at Factory, a company developing a frontier
software development agent, has spent 3 billion tokens in four months
through an agent without writing any code. None of the code was read,
but Tossell read the agent output religiously, which led to him
picking up a ton of knowledge around how code works, how projects
work, where things fail, and where they succeed. Tossell has shipped
several projects using his method over the past few months, including
a personal site, a 'wrapped' product for Factory, several custom CLIs,
and an AI-directed video demo system. This post contains Tossell's
guide to learning to program. 

 HERE ARE THE MAJOR CHANGES I SEE COMING FOR CYBERSECURITY IN 2026 (10
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The primary security question for companies will be how good their
attackers' AI is versus their own AI. There will be increased spending
on agentic security platforms and significantly more in-house building
of security tools. Asset management will become possible for the first
time because of agents. Most security platforms will eventually be
replaceable with AI prompts.

 8 PREDICTIONS FOR 2026. WHAT COMES NEXT IN AI? (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 2026 will be the year when generative UI takes off, the Smart Home
finally fulfills its promise, and biometric proof of personhood
becomes the new social login. Engineers looking to separate themselves
from the crowd need to build and learn, as deep technical intuition is
what will distinguish them from others. Agents will continue to be the
main headline. This year, they will start interacting in our daily
lives to anticipate needs. 

 REFLECTIONS ON 2025 (29 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI tends to improve at the same pace that AI researchers get access
to faster hardware. The hardware scheduled to come online in the next
few years makes current hardware look like pocket calculators. If
previous observations hold true, then we are not approaching a
plateau, the field is just getting started.
