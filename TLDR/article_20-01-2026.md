 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native solution provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA
cycle to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks [6]—not years
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs [7]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of engineers [8] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

 LLMS AND YOUR CAREER (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Interesting software development jobs aren't likely to disappear. The
jobs that are dependent on the fundamentals of software aren't going
to stop being dependent on the fundamentals of software. More LLM
usage will mean more stress on the tools and applications that rely on
the fundamentals of software. The most conservative way to build a
career as a software developer is to be practical and effective at
problem-solving and to better understand over time how the tools you
use work so that you can make better decisions. 

 I WAS A TOP 0.01% CURSOR USER. HERE'S WHY I SWITCHED TO CLAUDE CODE
2.0 (32 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Claude Code 2.0 has a flexible and robust harness with an evolved UX
and fewer bugs. The RLHF Anthropic did on Opus 4.5 completely changed
the equation. Users no longer need to review code or instruct the
model at the level of files or functions: they can just test behaviors
instead. Claude Code can be used by developers who never plan on
learning how to code and just care about outputs.

 ALL BETS ARE ON: THE RISE OF PREDICTION MARKETS (10 MINUTE READ) [18]


 Nearly $12 billion was traded on Kalshi and Polymarket in December,
up more than 400% from a year earlier. The rise of prediction markets
has created new risks and raised fears about the spread of gambling.
There are also concerns about market manipulation and insider trading.
Proponents of prediction markets claim that the platforms are
fundamentally different from gambling and that they offer a valuable
new source of information by allowing people to bet on world events.
