 EVERYTHING GOOGLE ANNOUNCED AT THE PIXEL 9 LAUNCH EVENT (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The Made By Google hardware event saw a refreshed Pixel 9 lineup and
updates across Google's other devices. Customers now have a smaller
Pixel 9 Pro option measuring 6.3 inches. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is
taller and thinner than its predecessor and features an inner display
with a peak brightness of 2,700 nits. The Google Pixel Watch 3 now has
a larger 45mm option. More details about the announcements Google made
at the event are available in the article. 

 US CONSIDERS A RARE ANTITRUST MOVE: BREAKING UP GOOGLE (9 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The Department of Justice is considering breaking up Alphabet
following a ruling that found the company monopolized the online
search market. The most likely units for divestment are the Android
operating system and Chrome web browser. Less severe options include
forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to
prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products. The
government will likely see a ban on the type of exclusive contracts
that were at the center of the case.

 AMAZON VIES FOR NUCLEAR-POWERED DATA CENTER (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Proposals for co-locating data centers next to nuclear power have
popped up in several places. The setup allows for data centers to draw
clean electricity directly rather than from the grid while avoiding
paying fees that would otherwise help maintain grids. It also means
that data centers are hogging hundreds of megawatts that could be
going to other customers. Amazon is currently dealing with regulatory
hurdles over a deal that would give one of its data centers an extra
180 megawatts of power as it would hurt all of the customers that buy
from the facility. 

 THE WEBB TELESCOPE FURTHER DEEPENS THE BIGGEST CONTROVERSY IN
COSMOLOGY (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An analysis of observations from the James Webb Space Telescope shows
conflicting cosmic expansion rates from different types of data. The
cosmic expansion rate has been consistently measured to be higher than
the theoretical prediction for how fast space should be expanding.
However, different teams have come up with different rates of
expansion. These discrepancies suggest that the theoretical model of
the cosmos might be missing something.

 THE NEW POSTGRESQL 17 MAKE DIST (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Creating a source code tarball is quite tricky to do by hand. While
it is possible to just run 'tar' over a currently checked out source
tree, developers need to be careful that the checkout is clean and not
locally modified and ensure that all the files that belong in the
tarball end up there and no other files. The resulting tarball should
work consistently across platforms and across time. This article looks
at how PostgreSQL makes a release. 

 MIXWAVE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Mixwave allows users to convert, package, and manipulate video on the
fly. It contains a comprehensive toolset designed to streamline video
workflows that covers everything from transcoding and packaging to
playback. Mixwave has a user-friendly API that makes self-hosting
videos easy.

 DEEP-LIVE-CAM GOES VIRAL, ALLOWING ANYONE TO BECOME A DIGITAL
DOPPELGANGER (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Deep-Live-Cam can take a person's face and apply it to a live webcam
video source while following pose, lighting, and expressions - from a
single photo. It is available for download for free on GitHub. There
are many face-swapping software projects out there - while most of
them take some knowledge to install, it is only a matter of time
before these tools become more accessible. Examples of face swaps
produced with the tool are available. 

 AMERICAN VULCAN (92 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Palmer Luckey was born in 1992 to Donald and Julie Freeman Luckey. He
was homeschooled along with his three younger sisters on the bottom
floor of a small multifamily home in Long Beach, at the edge of Los
Angeles. Luckey single-handedly turned virtual reality from the
laughingstock of the technology industry into a multi-billion-dollar
enterprise by inventing the Oculus Rift in a camper trailer. The facts
of Luckey's life are uniquely bizarre - this article takes a look at
his life and what he's done since selling Oculus to Facebook for $2.7
billion.
