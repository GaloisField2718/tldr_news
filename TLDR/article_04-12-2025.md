 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native solution provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA
cycle to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks [6]—not years
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs [7]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of engineers [8] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

 SAM ALTMAN HAS EXPLORED DEAL TO BUILD COMPETITOR TO ELON MUSK'S
SPACEX (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sam Altman has explored the possibility of acquiring or partnering
with a rocket company to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX. He has
reached out to at least one rocket maker already. There were talks
around a series of equity investments, but the talks are no longer
active. OpenAI recently declared a 'code red' to improve ChatGPT. As a
result, the company is delaying the rollout of other products.

new feature called Wrapped Party, which pits listeners against their
friends to see who is the bigger music fan. Users can receive awards

group's music tastes. Spotify has brought back its interactive song
quiz and top artist sprint this year. This year's Wrapped also
highlights top audiobook genres for the first time.

 CHINA'S 1ST REUSABLE ROCKET EXPLODES IN DRAMATIC FIREBALL DURING
LANDING AFTER REACHING ORBIT ON DEBUT FLIGHT (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Chinese company Landspace's Zhuque-3 rocket exploded after
successfully reaching orbit on Tuesday. The 216-foot stainless steel
rocket successfully placed its expendable second stage in orbit, but
the first stage booster appeared to lose an engine during its landing
burn. No one was harmed in the incident. The anomaly is currently
under investigation to discover its root cause. A video of the
explosion is available in the article. 

 DRAGONFIRE LASER WEAPON TAKES DOWN HIGH-SPEED DRONES (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Britain's DragonFire laser weapon shot down drones flying at 404 mph
on November 20 at the Ministry of Defence's Hebrides Range in
Scotland. The high-powered, solid-state laser will be installed in the
Navy's Type 45 frigates by 2027. It can hit a target the size of a US
quarter over a distance of 0.62 miles. The laser weapon can lock onto
and fire at hostiles that are flying at a distance and at an altitude
where they are above the curvature of the Earth.

 CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY IN REACT SERVER COMPONENTS (4 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 There is a security vulnerability in React Server Components that
allows unauthenticated remote code execution. It exploits a flaw in
how React decodes payloads sent to React Server Function endpoints.
Apps may still be vulnerable even if they don't implement any React
Server Function endpoints. The vulnerability is present in versions
19.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0 of react-server-dom-webpack,
react-server-dom-parcel, and react-server-dom-turbopack. 

 FAILED SOFTWARE PROJECTS ARE STRATEGIC FAILURES (27 MINUTE READ) [16]


 You need to know how to formulate a strategy to avoid strategic
failure. Decide what your basic goals are, consider your positioning
in your environment, and look at your strengths and weaknesses as a
strategic entity. As a business, your first sweeping goal is continued
survival, followed by maximizing total profitability. Consider
different things that you can do in your circumstances to achieve your
strategic goals. Organizations can usually only pursue a few goals at
once, so set objectives that provide the maximum amount of impact with
the available resources.

MINUTE READ) [17]

2015. Apple will replace Dye with longtime designer Stephen Lemay.
Meta is creating a new design studio and putting Dye in charge of
design for hardware, software, and AI integration for its interfaces. 

 EVERYONE IN SEATTLE HATES AI (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Tech workers in Seattle tend to react negatively when the topic of AI
is brought up. This is due to several reasons, like layoffs due to AI,
the proliferation of AI in software, and being forced to use AI tools
whether they work or not. The result is that engineers are no longer
trying because they think they can't, and companies aren't empowering
them because they assume they shouldn't. Bad products are only
reinforcing the belief that AI is doomed.
