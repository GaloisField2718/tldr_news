 APPLE TO FINE-TUNE GEMINI INDEPENDENTLY, NO GOOGLE BRANDING ON SIRI,
MORE (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple recently announced that it had decided to rely on Gemini to
power its AI features. The company will be able to fine-tune the model
so that it responds in Apple's preferred manner. Apple's AI won't
respond with any branding related to Google or Gemini. Some of the
features will launch this spring. More advanced features are expected
to be announced at Apple's annual developer conference in June. 

 META SEEKS TO DOUBLE RAY-BAN GLASSES OUTPUT AFTER SURGE IN DEMAND (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta and EssilorLuxottica are discussing potentially doubling
production capacity to 20 million units or more by the end of the year
to capture growing demand and head off rivals. They may potentially
further establish the capability of producing more than 30 million
units if demand justifies such a move. No final decisions have been
made yet. The talks signal confidence that smart glasses can move
beyond early adopters and reach mass-market scale.

 AS SPACEX WORKS TOWARD 50K STARLINK SATELLITES, CHINA EYES DEPLOYING
200K (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 China's Institute of Radio Spectrum Utilization and Technological
Innovation has filed a request with the International
Telecommunications Union to operate a satellite constellation with a
total of 193,428 satellites. The request far exceeds the ambitions of
other current constellation projects. The Chinese constellations plan
to use a wide range of radio frequencies and will be deployed across
numerous orbits from 300 to 600 kilometers, as well as higher objects
at around 20,000 kilometers. The US Federal Communications Commission
views China's satellite ambitions as a national security threat.

 HOW TO WRITE A GOOD SPEC FOR AI AGENTS (49 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Smart specs guide agents clearly, stay within practical context
sizes, and evolve with projects. Aim to create clear specs that cover
just enough nuance to guide the AI without overwhelming it. Break
large tasks into smaller ones. Plan first in read-only mode before
executing, and iterate continuously. This post presents a framework
for spec-writing that keeps AI agents focused and productive.

 PERSONAL TASTE IS THE MOAT (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI should be part of every process, but the final filter must be
human judgment informed by taste. The hardest decisions aren't
reducible to rules. AI can tell you whether something works, but only
taste can tell you whether it belongs. Personal taste is the moat when
execution is cheap and correctness is abundant.
