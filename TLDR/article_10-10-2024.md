 DOJ INDICATES IT'S CONSIDERING GOOGLE BREAKUP FOLLOWING MONOPOLY
RULING (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Department of Justice has indicated that it is considering
behavioral and structural remedies as a result of its monopoly ruling
against Google. The remedies could include contract requirements and
prohibitions, non-discrimination product requirements, data and
interoperability requirements, and structural requirements. They may
include limiting or prohibiting default agreements and other
revenue-sharing arrangements related to search and search-related
products. The remedies are still far from being decided - Judge Amit
Mehta says he'll aim to rule on the remedies by August 2025, and an
appeal by Google will likely draw out any impact for potentially
years. 

 TESLA ROBOTAXI REVEAL: WHAT TO EXPECT (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tesla plans to reveal its Robotaxi today at an event at Warner Bros.
Discovery's movie studio in Burbank, California, starting at 7 pm. The
vehicle will be a two-door, two-seater, Cybertruck-like compact
vehicle likely without a steering wheel or pedals. Tesla may run into
regulatory issues for the design - Elon Musk is expected to use this
as a reason for why getting the vehicle to market will be difficult.
The movie studio features large sound stages and sets. The environment
is closed and controlled, with no other traffic, making it the perfect
place for Tesla to demo its new technology.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 GOOGLE IDENTIFIES LOW NOISE “PHASE TRANSITION” IN ITS QUANTUM
PROCESSOR (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google has published a paper that identifies a phase transition in
its quantum processor and uses it to identify conditions where the
processor can operate with low noise. The paper shows that it would
take a supercomputer a dozen years to simulate things even in those
conditions. This article details the findings and their implications
in more detail. 

 ZAP ENERGY SHOWS OFF ITS NEW FUSION POWER PROTOTYPE, CENTURY (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Zap Energy recently raised a $130 million Series D to build its
Century device, an approach to fusion power that sends bolts of
electricity through plasma streams instead of using magnets or lasers
to squeeze the plasma. The current generates a magnetic field that
compresses the plasma, which results in fusion. The final
commercial-scale model, which should produce 50 megawatts of
electricity, will occupy a footprint around the size of a
double-decker bus. This article provides an overview of how Zap's
technology works and the problems the company has to overcome before
its technology becomes commercially viable.

 DON'T LET DICTS SPOIL YOUR CODE (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Dicts make functions difficult to modify and their mutable nature
hinders the structure of data and makes it dependent on the workflow
of applications. This article discusses some better ways to handle
data. The longer a developer postpones introducing proper data
structures, the more complex the transition becomes.
