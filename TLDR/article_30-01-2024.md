 ELON MUSK‚ÄôS NEURALINK IMPLANTS BRAIN TECH IN HUMAN PATIENT FOR THE
FIRST TIME (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Neuralink implanted a device in a human for the first time on Sunday.
The patient is recovering well, according to a post on X by Elon Musk.
Neuralink is developing a brain implant that aims to help patients
with severe paralysis control external technologies using only neural
signals. The technology could help patients with severe degenerative
diseases communicate and interact with devices using their minds.
Neuralink has not disclosed how many human patients are involved in
its initial in-human trial. 

 APPLE HAS SOLD APPROXIMATELY 200,000 VISION PRO HEADSETS (1 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 A source with knowledge of Apple's sales numbers says that the
company has sold more than 200,000 Vision Pro headsets. Pre-orders for
the headset began on January 19. Media reviews for the device are set
to go live today, so that could increase sales, and there is also an
expected uptick in purchases after actual consumers begin sharing
hands-on experiences. Apple is prepared for a limited number of sales
due to the Vision Pro's niche market and high price tag.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SCIENTISTS THINK THEY'RE ON THE VERGE OF BREACHING THE BLOOD-BRAIN
BARRIER (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The brain and spinal cord are well protected by the blood-brain
barrier, which stops almost all drugs from entering the central
nervous system. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are
testing the delivery of lipid nanoparticles, fat-soluble packages that
can pass through the blood-brain barrier and carry proteins,
antibodies, and messenger RNA with them. The technique is able to pass
some drugs through the blood-brain barrier, but not all of the
medicine made it into brain cells when tested in living mice. The
researchers are using a new in vitro model that will help guide the
future development of brain-targeted treatments. 

 SCIENTISTS DOCUMENT FIRST-EVER TRANSMITTED ALZHEIMER‚ÄôS CASES, TIED
TO NO-LONGER-USED MEDICAL PROCEDURE (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A decades-old treatment for a number of conditions that caused short
stature, which involved patients receiving growth hormone taken from
the brains of human cadavers, has been tied to some people as young as
in their 30s developing Alzheimer's disease. The treatment, which was
banned 40 years ago, transmitted unwanted proteins into recipients'
brains, including the beta-amyloid protein that later propagated into
the disease-causing plaques that are the hallmark of the disease.
These are the first documented cases of transferred Alzheimer's - the
disease is not usually contagious. The cadaveric growth hormone
treatment has been long replaced with a synthetic hormone treatment.

 THE BIG LITTLE GUIDE TO MESSAGE QUEUES (40 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Message queues are a way to transfer information between two systems.
They allow systems to communicate with each other in structured ways
they can both understand and at a controlled speed they can both
handle. This article discusses message queues, their history, why
they're useful, how they work, and more. It compares many popular
systems available today. The article covers fundamental concepts that
underlie message queues and how they apply to popular queuing systems
available today. 

 NEW GITHUB COPILOT RESEARCH FINDS 'DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON CODE QUALITY'
(4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A recent study on the quality and maintainability of AI-assisted code
found disconcerting trends for maintainability. The percentage of
lines that are reverted or updated less than two weeks after being
authored is projected to double this year compared to a pre-AI
baseline. Using AI coding tools is strongly correlated with mistake
code being pushed to repositories. While AI may be able to produce
code faster, the code it produces needs to be cleaned up, potentially
removing the benefits of fast code generation.

 WHAT BIG TECH LAYOFFS SUGGEST FOR THE INDUSTRY (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Microsoft's layoffs last year were worrisome because the company has
a very good track record of predicting how its business will grow or
shrink. Microsoft's business is incredibly diversified to the point
where it can be pretty representative of the B2B tech industry, minus
advertising. The company's decision to initiate layoffs suggested that
the tech industry would stall growth-wise. Microsoft's announcements
could have caused other large tech companies to follow suit and
announce their own layoffs. 

 STARLINK'S LATEST OFFERING: GIGABIT GATEWAYS STARTING AT $75,000 PER
MONTH (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Starlink's latest new Community Gateways service for internet service
providers can deliver gigabit speeds. For $1.25 million up front (and
$75,000 per month), customers will receive help to build an entire
facility dedicated to receiving up to 10Gbps in broadband speeds. ISPs
will need to provide the land, power, and lifting equipment. The first
Community Gateway was built on an island near Alaska. Pictures from
the Community Gateway are available in the article.
