 🚀 FASTER MOBILE RELEASES WITH AUTOMATED QA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-NATIVE SERVICE delivers 80% AUTOMATED TEST COVERAGE
IN WEEKS [6], with tests running on REAL IOS DEVICES and ANDROID
EMULATORS—all in 100% PARALLEL with ZERO FLAKES. [7]

✅ QA cycles reduced to just 15 minutes

✅ Multi-device + gesture interactions fully supported

✅ Reliable test execution with no flakes or false positives

✅ Zero flakes, human-verified bug reports

Engineering teams MOVE FASTER, releases stay on track, and testing
happens automatically—so developers can focus on building, not
debugging.

 CHATGPT GOES SHOPPING WITH NEW PRODUCT-BROWSING FEATURE (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 OpenAI has announced new shopping features in ChatGPT Search that
will allow users to search for products and purchase them through
merchant websites after being redirected from the ChatGPT interface.
The experience resembles Google Shopping - users click on a product
image and the interface displays multiple retailers on the right side
of the screen with buttons to complete purchases. Product reviews come
from various online sources and users can choose which review sources
for ChatGPT to prioritize. The product results are not sponsored for
now, but the company is likely working towards enabling sponsored
placements. 

 AMAZON LAUNCHES FIRST KUIPER INTERNET SATELLITES IN BID TO TAKE ON
ELON MUSK'S STARLINK (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Amazon launched its first batch of 27 Kuiper internet satellites into
space on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) rocket at the Cape Canaveral
Space Force Station in Florida shortly after 7 PM ET yesterday. The
Federal Communications Commission expects Amazon to launch half of its
total constellation up in the air by July 2026. Amazon has booked more
than 80 launches with ULA, SpaceX, Arianespace, and Blue Origin to
deploy dozens of satellites at a time. The company will invest up to
$10 billion to build the Kuiper network.

 FIRST 3D-PRINTED STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP OPENS TOMORROW IN TEXAS (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A new 3D-printed Starbucks has opened in Brownsville, Texas. The
Cobod BOD2-printed concrete fabricated shop is open for both in-person
pickup and drive-through orders. It is not a very large store - its
1,400 sq ft shell is just enough for a mobile order pick-up desk and a
drive-through coffee shop. There is no indoor seating and no in-person
walk-in order system. 

 TOOTH SUCCESSFULLY GROWN IN LAB (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Scientists from London's King's College and Imperial College have
grown a tooth in a lab. They used a specially developed material to
mimic the conditions required for natural tooth development. The
technology could eventually offer patients a biological alternative to
artificial fillings and implants. Now that researchers have replicated
the right environment, the challenge is in translating the discovery
into a clinical setting.

 CLERK + LOVABLE: ADD SECURE SIGN IN, SIGNUP, AND WAITLIST (SPONSOR)
[13] 

 Clerk handles authentication and user management for your Lovable
apps. With just a few prompts [14], you get secure sign-in & sign-up
(SSO, MFA, and more), prebuilt UI components (user profile, org
management, impersonation), Waitlist mode, and more. Learn how in this
step-by-step guide [14] 

 MAGNITUDE (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Magnitude is an end-to-end testing framework powered by visual AI
agents that can see interfaces and adapt to any changes in them. It
features a strong reasoning agent for planning and adjusting tests, a
fast visual agent for reliably executing runs, and a reasoning agent
that steps in if there is a problem. Magnitude saves plans to execute
runs in the same way locally or in CI/CD pipelines. 

 THE ONE-PERSON FRAMEWORK IN PRACTICE (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 PlanGo had one developer until 2025. This was made possible through
Rails, which allowed the developer to be fast and efficient. The
company's apps combined have over 100,000 yearly downloads, all built
and maintained by one Rails developer. This post discusses how PlanGo
was developed, the lessons learned over 14 years of building as a solo
technical founder, and PlanGo's future plans.

 SYCOPHANCY IS THE FIRST LLM "DARK PATTERN" (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 OpenAI's models being overly sycophantic is bad because it's
dangerous to validate people's belief that they're always in the
right. This sycophancy is a dark pattern - a user interface designed
to trick users into doing things they'd prefer not to do. The whole
process of turning an AI base model into a model you can chat to is a
process of making the model want to please the user. The problem
happens when users collide with the real world and do things because a
large language model has convinced them it is a good idea - and then
they return to the model for comfort, and sink even deeper into the
illusion. 

 ON DROPOUTS AND BOOTSTRAPS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Many in the tech industry arrived at where they are through their own
work and research - reading the source code, books, and manuals and
trying things out. While this may make some of them think they're
better than college graduates, this is likely not the case: people are
really good at justifying their status, and this is just another way
for some people to reinforce existing power structures. A lot of
college dropouts worked really hard to get where they are, but that
doesn't mean they didn't also just get very lucky.
