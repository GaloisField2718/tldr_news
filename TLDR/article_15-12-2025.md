TLDR 2025-12-15

 AI AGENTS ARE MICROSERVICES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When AI becomes part of your software stack, you need more than
agentic DAG. You need an AI backend [5] that treats agents like
microservices — distributed, observable, and governable.

AgentField [6] is open-source infrastructure for production AI: REST
APIs, async execution, built-in memory, and cryptographic agent
identity with automatic audit trails.

Think Kubernetes for agents: a control plane where you build AI like
you build software.

 SPACEX STARTS A WALL STREET BAKE-OFF TO HIRE BANKS FOR POSSIBLE IPO
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX has started the selection process for a banker to advise it on
its initial public offering. Investment banks are scheduled to make
their first pitches this week. SpaceX is also pursuing a secondary
share sale that would value the company at roughly $800 billion. The
US IPO market is picking up momentum after several years of relative
quiet. 

 CAN NETFLIX HELP SAVE THE AMERICAN MALL? (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Netflix House is a new permanent brand activation/movie
theater/retail outlet designed to extend the lives of Netflix's most
popular shows. They will enable fans of shows to experience more of a
franchise in real life. The company has already opened a Netflix House
location at the King of Prussia mall in the Philadelphia suburbs and a
second at the former Belk department store, which anchors the Galleria
Dallas mall in Texas. It plans to open a third location at BLVD Las
Vegas in 2027.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 IF A META AI MODEL CAN READ A BRAIN-WIDE SIGNAL, WHY WOULDN'T THE
BRAIN? (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Our brains are able to both detect and produce magnetic fields.
Researchers at Meta were able to decode the brain's magnetic fields
into actual images and words by training models on public datasets.
This opens up the possibility that the brain may be able to read and
write its own field. This article explores the idea and how it could
relate to consciousness. 

 WHAT HAPPENED TO QUANTIFIED SELF? (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Quantified Self movement has largely fizzled out. It's not easy
to collect data about yourself, and it's hard to make real use of it.
There's also a cost to building vast data profiles of yourself that
people may want to avoid. People still track their data, just not as a
larger self-quantification project.

 DESIGN IS SEARCH (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Design is like a search, not a production pipeline. The design
process is valuable. Early design needs freedom, but later design
needs reality. You might ship faster when you collapse these phases,
but you lose a lot in the process. New technology makes it faster to
build, but that's not what design is really about. 

 HOW TO BUILD YOUR FIRST CHATGPT APP (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 ChatGPT Apps allow developers and product teams to embed apps
directly into ChatGPT, enabling users to complete tasks like book
hotels, search for properties, and shop online. With a platform of 800
million weekly active users, ChatGPT's app platform may be the next
great distribution wave. This article walks readers through how to
build ChatGPT apps. It includes real-world examples, code, and links
to courses with more material.

 INSIDE THE INVITATION-ONLY STOCK MARKET FOR THE WEALTHY (14 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 The ultrawealthy buy shares of the most in-demand companies via
invite-only transactions long before the shares are listed on public
stock exchanges. This small, privileged group can obtain shares of
companies still in their early growth stages, while the rest are left
with older, slower-growing names. This dynamic is exacerbating the
wealth disparity in the US. It could even become an existential threat
to the US economy. 

 APPLE LOSES ITS APPEAL OF A SCATHING CONTEMPT RULING IN IOS PAYMENTS
CASE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apple was found to be in willful violation of a 2021 injunction
intended to open up iOS App Store Payments in April. That contempt of
court finding has now been almost entirely upheld by the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals. Apple may still be able to charge a 'reasonable fee'
for payments made outside its App Store based on actual costs to
ensure user security and privacy. The ruling means that there will
likely soon be rapid adoption of outside payment processors.
