 THE PATH TO BECOMING ENTERPRISE READY: 3 DEVELOPER'S GUIDES TO GET
STARTED (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you have ambitions to sell software to enterprise customers,
single sign-on [5] and SCIM provisioning [6] are likely non-negotiable
features you must support. These are important for security, user
lifecycle management, and access control. Here are 3 TECHNICAL GUIDES
FROM WORKOS:

 	* A guide to organization modeling [7] ‚Äî How your app handles
users, teams, and the relationships between the two ‚Äî is an
important but often overlooked part of building authentication and
authorization into your app.
 	* The developer's guide to SSO [8] ‚Äî A deep dive into the SAML
authentication flow, XML nuances, and why rolling your own SSO is so
challenging.
 	* Unlocking the power of SCIM: streamlining enterprise user
management [9] ‚Äî Besides secure user deprovisioning, SCIM can unlock
additional use cases such as pre-provisioning, automated access
management, and more.

 INTEL CEO PAT GELSINGER'S DREAM JOB TAKES A NIGHTMARISH TURN (5
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Intel's stock ended Friday trading down 26 percent. The company
recently reported financial results and an outlook with
lower-than-expected revenue and profit-margin forecasts. It plans to
lay off around 15,000 employees, target $10 billion in cost cuts next
year, and suspend dividend payments in the fourth quarter. Intel's
market value is now at a level last seen 15 years ago. 

 NVIDIA REPORTEDLY DELAYS ITS NEXT AI CHIP DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Nvidia's Blackwell B200 chips will take at least three months longer
to produce than was planned. The delay is due to a design flaw that
was discovered unusually late in the production process. Nvidia is now
working through a fresh set of test runs and won't ship large numbers
of the chips until the first quarter. Microsoft, Google, and Meta have
already ordered tens of billions of dollars worth of the chips.

 NEURALINK INSTALLS ITS BRAIN IMPLANT INTO A SECOND HUMAN PATIENT (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Elon Musk announced on a recent podcast that Neuralink has installed
its second implant into a human patient. The implant is apparently
working very well. Musk said last month that there could be over 1,000
humans with Neuralink implants by 2026. A link to the podcast, in
which Musk discusses Neuralink and its brain implant technology at
length, is available in the article - Musk shares the news near the
beginning of the four hour conversation. 

 CONSIDER THE EEL (32 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Forsea Foods is an Israeli startup focused on growing eel meat in the
lab. The company believes that starting with a premium offering makes
the most sense due to the high costs of production. The price of eel
meat is set to rise as the global population is cratering - the
European eel population has fallen by 98% since 1980. Forsea's
technology allows it to grow different types of cells in a single
bioreactor, cutting down on both production time and costs. It plans
to launch its product commercially starting in Japan in 2026.

 üí∏ MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF CONTAINER SPEND IS WASTED ON IDLE
RESOURCES (SPONSOR) [15] 

 Datadog's State of Cloud Costs report [15] reveals that organizations
are spending big, even when they can avoid it. Container costs now
account for a third of EC2 spend, with up to 80% of it wasted [15] on
idle resources. AI is also taking its toll: GPU spend up by 40%. Read
the full findings and analysis [15] 

 REAL-TIME DATABASE STARTUP CLICKHOUSE ACQUIRES PEERDB TO EXPAND ITS
POSTGRES SUPPORT (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 ClickHouse has acquired PeerDB, a company focused on cost-effective
Postgres replication and change data capture. PeerDB offers speed
improvements and a number of specialized capabilities that ClickHouse
didn't previously offer. Its open source components will remain open
source without any change to their licenses and ClickHouse will also
open source the production-grade Helm charts for PeerDB's enterprise
offering. Existing commercial customers will be able to use the PeerDB
Cloud service until July 24 next year.

 THERE'S A TOOL TO CATCH STUDENTS CHEATING WITH CHATGPT. OPENAI HASN'T
RELEASED IT (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenAI has a method that can reliably detect when someone has used
ChatGPT to write an essay or research paper, but it hasn't released it
despite it having been ready for release for about a year. The company
is concerned that the tool would be unpopular with its users and
disproportionately affect some groups. The tool is 99.9% effective
when there is enough text. However, the watermarks it generates can be
erased through simple techniques like having Google translate the text
into another language and back or having ChatGPT add emojis to the
text and then manually deleting them. 

 MISTRAL AI CEO ARTHUR MENSCH ON MICROSOFT, REGULATION, AND EUROPE'S
AI ECOSYSTEM (13 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Mistral AI has rapidly risen as a homegrown European champion over
the past year. The company was valued at more than $6 billion in June.
Its CEO, Arthur Mensch, has been vocal in debates over the EU's AI
law, saying that lawmakers should focus on regulating how others use
those models rather than regulating general-purpose AI models like
Mistral's. This article contains an interview with Mensch where he
discusses attracting talent, how Mistral plans to turn a profit, and
what's missing from Europe's AI ecosystem.
