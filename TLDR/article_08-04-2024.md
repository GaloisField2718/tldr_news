 TESLA IS UNVEILING ITS NEW ‚ÄòROBOTAXI‚Äô ON AUGUST 8 (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Tesla is planning to unveil its next-generation self-driving robotaxi
vehicle on August 8. The announcement appears to be an acceleration of
the robotaxi program, which aims to design a vehicle optimized from
the ground up for driverless ridesharing. Some Tesla owners are
concerned with the project as it could result in Tesla focusing on
achieving self-driving on new hardware rather than on its existing
vehicle fleet as promised and sold to customers for years. A picture
of an early design prototype is available in the article. 

 MUSK OUTLINES PLANS TO INCREASE STARSHIP LAUNCH RATE AND PERFORMANCE
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The fourth SpaceX Starship/Super Heavy launch may be in the next
month or so. Its goal will be to get Starship's upper stage to get
through the high heating regime of reentry and make a controlled splat
into the ocean. SpaceX aims to bring the Super Heavy booster back
intact, having it land on a virtual tower in the Gulf of Mexico. It
could attempt to land a Starship booster on the real tower as soon as
the vehicle's fifth flight. The company is working to accelerate
production of Starship vehicles to support higher flight rates and
increase payload capacity.

 SCIENTISTS ARE DEEP-FREEZING CORALS TO REPOPULATE THE OCEAN (9 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Coral reefs are degrading at an unprecedented rate due to pollution,
overfishing, and destructive forestry and mining practices on land.
Most corals could go extinct within a few generations. The
Smithsonian‚Äôs National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute's Reef
Recovery Initiative aims to help save coral reefs using
cryopreservation, a novel approach that involves storing and cooling
coral sperm and larvae at very low temperatures and holding them in
government biorepositories. The frozen assets can be used to help
reseed the oceans and restore living reefs even 100 years from now.
Cryopreserved sperm has already been used to produce new coral across
the Caribbean. 

 HYPERSONIC STARTUP UNVEILS ITS FIRST AIRCRAFT (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hermeus, a company that is attempting to build hypersonic aircraft
with jet engines that would allow them to take off from runways like
traditional planes, has unveiled a flying prototype to demonstrate
high-speed takeoff and landing. The Mk 1 is an uncrewed, remotely
piloted plane that will allow Hermeus to conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of the aircraft's performance and examine the effectiveness
of the company's test procedures, safety culture, and
interdisciplinary team collaboration. The company's next prototype is
expected to demonstrate supersonic flight in 2025. A video featuring
the Mk 1 is available in the article.

 HOW STACK OVERFLOW REPLACED EXPERTS EXCHANGE (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article tells the story of how and why Stack Overflow was
created and discusses whether the site will have a place in
engineering culture over the next decade. Before Stack Overflow, there
was Experts Exchange, one of the first question-and-answer sites on
the internet, coming into existence in 1996. Experts Exchange was free
for over a decade, but it moved to a subscription-based model in 2004.
This paywall created the perfect moment for a new site to
counter-position itself, so the creators of Stack Overflow decided to
create a more user-friendly version of Experts Exchange. Stack
Overflow launched in 2008, the same year as GitHub, Apple's App Store,
and Airbnb. The future existence of Stack Overflow will depend
entirely on how well it can adapt to AI.

 HOW TECH GIANTS CUT CORNERS TO HARVEST DATA FOR A.I. (22 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 OpenAI solved its data supply problem in late 2021 by developing a
speech recognition tool called Whisper to transcribe audio from
YouTube videos, yielding new text to train its AI systems. Its team
ultimately transcribed more than one million hours of video to train
GPT-4. Google and Meta have also similarly cut corners in the race to
lead AI, obtaining data in legally and ethically dubious ways. This
article discusses the various methods companies have used to obtain
data - or have considered using to obtain data - for AI training
purposes. 

 ASK HN: WHAT IS THE MOST USELESS PROJECT YOU HAVE WORKED ON? (HACKER
NEWS THREAD) [15] 

 Developers are sometimes assigned tasks that make no sense. This
Hacker News thread contains many examples of this phenomenon. Some of
these examples include implementing fixes for a deprecated tool,
making an internal tool suck more so people would stop using it,
projects that never launched for various reasons, and a company morale
meter.
