 OPENAI AND MICROSOFT REPORTEDLY RENEGOTIATING PARTNERSHIP TO ALLOW
FOR POTENTIAL IPO (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI and Microsoft are reworking their partnership to allow OpenAI
to move forward with a restructuring plan to create a for-profit
public benefit corporation controlled by its nonprofit parent.
Microsoft may take a smaller equity stake in the new entity in
exchange for extended access to OpenAI's technology beyond the
previously agreed-upon 2030 cutoff. OpenAI plans to reduce the
percentage of revenue it shares with Microsoft as part of the
restructuring. It needs approval from Microsoft to proceed with its
plan. 

 ELIZABETH HOLMES'S PARTNER HAS A NEW BLOOD-TESTING START-UP (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 While Elizabeth Holmes is in prison for defrauding investors through
Theranos, her partner, Billy Evans, plans to start his own blood
testing company. Evans is trying to raise money for a blood-testing
company with a machine that bears more than a passing resemblance to
Theranos' infamous blood-testing machine. The company, Haemanthus, is
still in stealth, and not much information is available about it. It
aims to eventually raise more than $50 million. Haemanthus plans to
first address the pet health care market before progressing to humans.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 CHINA JUST MADE THE WORLD'S FASTEST TRANSISTOR AND IT IS NOT MADE OF
SILICON (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A group of scientists at Peking University has created what they
claim is the world's fastest and most efficient transistor. Made with
a slender sheet of lab-grown bismuth and a new architecture, the
two-dimensional, silicon-free transistor represents a radical
rethinking of what chips can be and how they can be made. Chinese
firms have been blocked from buying the latest silicon chip-making
equipment due to ongoing US-led export restrictions, forcing
researchers to find solutions from fresh perspectives. The team is now
working on scaling up production - they used existing fabrication
platforms, so the barrier to mass production may not be as high as
with other experimental technologies. 

 US MILITARY TAPS ROCKET LAB'S NEW NEUTRON LAUNCHER FOR ‘POINT TO
POINT' CARGO TEST FLIGHT IN 2026 (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Rocket Lab and the US Air Force Research Laboratory have planned a
launch and return-to-Earth mission for Rocket Lab's Neutron rocket no
earlier than 2026. The flight will test Neutron's reentry capabilities
and the rocket's viability for global point-to-point cargo
transportation objectives. Rocket Lab plans to debut its partially
reusable Neutron later in 2025. The company has been launching its
59-foot-tall Electron rocket since 2018 and has significantly
increased its launch cadence over the past few years. Neutron will
stand at 141 feet tall with a 23-foot diameter.

 REACT THREE (WEBSITE) [10] 

 React Three is a React renderer for three.js. It allows developers to
build scenes declaratively with re-usable, self-contained components
that react to state, are readily interactive, and can participate in
React's ecosystem. Everything that works in three.js will work with
React Three. This site allows developers to select React Three
packages to include into their projects via npm, download, or by
creating a repository. 

 ASK HN: WHAT WILL TECH EMPLOYMENT LOOK LIKE IN 10 YEARS? (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [11] 

 While the role of the coder will likely still exist in 10 years, it
will probably look very different from what it is today. However, it
is important to remember that there is still a lot of work to be done
before large language models can even replace junior developers. The
role of debugging will grow as models trained on previous errors and
methods won't catch bugs. AI is just another technology that claims it
will change the world - it hasn't taken over yet, and it might not,
just like 3D printing didn't ruin manufacturing, blockchain didn't
ruin finance, and the metaverse hasn't caused mass migrations away
from cities.

 THE STEALTHY LAB COOKING UP AMAZON'S SECRET SAUCE (9 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Annapurna Labs was a secretive Israeli chip-design startup purchased
by Amazon for about $350 million a decade ago. Amazon's entire AI
strategy is now built on a foundation of chips designed by Annapurna.
The company has planned more than $100 billion of capital expenditures
for this year, mostly on AWS infrastructure required for AI systems
using homemade silicon. This article looks at the history of the
startup and how a discussion over beer and wine eventually led to one
of the most consequential deals in tech history. 

 FORMER APPLE DESIGN CHIEF JONY IVE REFLECTS ON COMPANY CULTURE,
ICONIC PRODUCTS, AND A WARNING FOR THE TECH INDUSTRY (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Apple's former Chief Design Officer, Jony Ive, recently gave a rare
interview at Stripe Sessions 2025 that offered insights into his
design philosophy, his time at Apple, and his current work at

experiences that shaped his career, the principles that guide
LoveFrom, the unintended consequences of the work of designers and

hardware project.
