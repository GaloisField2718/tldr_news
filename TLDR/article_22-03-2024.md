 U.S. SUES APPLE, ACCUSING IT OF MAINTAINING AN IPHONE MONOPOLY (12
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple is being sued by the US for employing a strategy that relies on
exclusionary anticompetitive conduct that hurts both consumers and
developers. The 88-page lawsuit says that the company violated
antitrust laws with practices that were intended to keep customers
reliant on their iPhones and make them less likely to switch to
competing devices. It seeks to put an end to those practices and
possibly a breakup of the company. The lawsuit is likely to drag out
for years before any type of resolution. 

 HERE‚ÄôS HOW MICROSOFT IS PROVIDING A ‚ÄòGOOD OUTCOME‚Äô FOR
INFLECTION AI VCS, AS REID HOFFMAN PROMISED (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Unnamed sources say that Microsoft is paying approximately $650
million in its deal with Inflection AI. $620 million was paid for
non-exclusive licensing fees for Inflection's technology and $30
million was paid to get Inflection to agree not to sue over
Microsoft's poaching. Inflection will pivot away from building a
personalized AI chatbot to becoming an AI studio that helps other
companies work with large language model AI. Microsoft has several
reasons for needing a backup for OpenAI - for one, its deal with
OpenAI is being scrutinized by the FTC.

 PIG KIDNEY TRANSPLANTED INTO LIVING PERSON FOR FIRST TIME (6 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Doctors have performed a pig-to-human kidney transplant for the first
time at Massachusetts General Hospital, the first hospital to perform
a kidney transplant. The genetically modified kidney was implanted
into a 62-year-old patient who had been diagnosed with end-stage
kidney disease. They are recovering well and are expected to be
discharged from the hospital soon. It is unknown how long the kidney
will last for. This was the third transplant of a pig organ into a
living human. The first two patients, who received heart transplants,
died weeks after receiving their organs. 

 THE BAFFLING INTELLIGENCE OF A SINGLE CELL/ (51 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 E. coli cells forage for nutrients using a process called chemotaxis.
While the bacteria don't have brains, they possess something similar
to a sense of smell, drive, and even memory. Chemotaxis involves
'smelling' chemicals and then deciding where to swim. The system is
able to adapt to different environments with varying levels of
attractant concentration. This article introduces the clever system
that powers chemotaxis and explains how the complex signaling network
works.

 THE REDDITS (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Reddit was one of the reasons Y Combinator was started. This post
tells the story of how the site came to be. Despite being rejected in
the first round for their food delivery app idea, Reddit's founders
were offered funding after agreeing to work on a project that would
eventually become Reddit. The project was launched on a quick
schedule. It had a core set of real users after just a few weeks.
Reddit is now a fundamentally useful tool that seems almost
unkillable. 

 CHOOSING STARTUP LIFE (12 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This article discusses things to consider when thinking about joining
a startup. A job may provide higher salaries, more perks, security,
less stress, and other benefits, but working in a startup can result
in huge payoffs. Startups require a ton of challenging work to be
successful, they have minimal infrastructure in place, and startup
employees have lower salaries. However, startup employees own a
portion of the company, and this could be worth a lot in the future.
