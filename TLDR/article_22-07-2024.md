 HOW A SOFTWARE UPDATE FROM CYBER FIRM CROWDSTRIKE CAUSED ONE OF THE
WORLD'S BIGGEST IT BLACKOUTS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A fault with an update issued by CrowdStrike led to worldwide outages
on Friday. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity vendor that develops
software to help companies detect and block hacks. It uses cloud
technology to apply cyber protections to internet connected devices.
The software requires deep access to systems to scan for threats. A
fix has been issued, but it could be hard to implement - engineers
will have to go into each individual data center running Windows to
apply the fix, entering complex encryption keys manually for encrypted
machines. 

 GOOGLE WANTS TO STEAL RAY-BAN MAKER FROM META FOR GEMINI SMART
GLASSES (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has approached Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica about putting
its Gemini assistant on future smart glasses. Meta was recently in
advanced talks with EssilorLuxottica about acquiring a five percent
stake in the company. It is unlikely that Meta will lose its
partnership with EssilorLuxottica to Google. Google is developing an
XR platform and has partnered with Samsung and Qualcomm for a device.
It previously partnered with Luxottica prior to its merger with
Essilor to make Google Glass.

 COMPLETE RECYCLE OF SOLID-STATE BATTERIES POSSIBLE, THANKS TO POLYMER
LAYERS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Solid-state lithium batteries are stable, have a higher energy
density, and are much safer than conventional lithium-ion batteries,
but they are more difficult to recycle. New research has revealed a
practical and efficient way to recycle solid-state batteries. The
process results in recycled batteries with over 92 percent of the
discharge capacity of the original battery. The research demonstrates
that it is possible to recycle solid-state batteries and harness their
potential without harming the environment. 

 ACCIDENTALLY EXPOSED YELLOWISH-GREEN CRYSTALS REVEAL ‚ÄòMIND-BLOWING'
FINDING ON MARS, SCIENTISTS SAY (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Curiosity rover has discovered rocks made of pure sulfur. The
discovery was made by accident after the 1-ton rover drove over a rock
and cracked it open, revealing yellowish-green crystals. On Earth,
pure elemental sulfur is mostly found in places like hydrothermal
vents. The rock was discovered in an area that was likely formed due
to violent water flows and landslides. Curiosity is still in great
health after 12 years of service.

 LET'S BLAME THE DEV WHO PRESSED "DEPLOY" (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Software developers are often incorrectly held responsible for bugs
and outages. The people responsible for these incidents are those who
put pressure on software engineers: CEOs, customers, regulators, and
other parties in positions of power. Other professionals, such as
anesthesiologists or structural engineers, are given the respect they
deserve and thus can take responsibility for their work. People ignore
software engineers, resulting in broken organizational practices. 

 CONCERNS ABOUT PASSKEYS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Passkeys are a technically interesting idea with many upsides, but
they take away power from the user. This article discusses some of the
issues with the technology. Passkeys can't be exported, sites can
discriminate on which apps and devices passkeys can be stored on, and
they rely on more centralized systems. It's bad for society if only
vetted and authorized entities can build passkey apps and it's bad for
users if they can't choose to use a particular passkey app.

 INSIDE THE FIGHT OVER CALIFORNIA'S NEW AI BILL (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 California state Senator Scott Wiener's Safe and Secure Innovation
for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models bill requires companies
training 'frontier models' that cost more than $100 million to do
safety testing and be able to shut off their models in the event of a
safety incident. The bill has received heavy criticism from the tech
industry. It will affect everyone who does business in California, not
just companies that develop their models in California. This article
contains an interview with Wiener about the bill and its critics. 

 AI PAID FOR BY ADS ‚Äì THE GPT-4O MINI INFLECTION POINT (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 With OpenAI's recent introduction of GPT-4o mini, it's now possible
to build dynamic, AI-generated content entirely supported by ads.
Google's AdSense pays approximately $0.0026 per page view. A site
could generate results tailored to user search queries and earn a
profit after calculating for the cost of the generated content. This
post presents a simple example of how this could be done with
calculations of how much it would cost/profit.
