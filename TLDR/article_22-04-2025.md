 TESLA LEAK SHOWS THAT MUSK'S VISION IS TREMBLING (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Tesla sales are down considerably worldwide. Banks say that Elon Musk
has created a 'code red situation' by overinvesting his time in the US
Department of Government Efficiency. Tesla's brand has taken a hit due
to Musk's public persona and many customers have returned their
vehicles to distance themselves from him. Musk's bet on the future of
self-driving tech over cheaper vehicles has lowered investor
confidence in his vision. Musk announced that there will be a live
company update during the earnings call today. 

 THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND GOOGLE BATTLE OVER HOW TO FIX A SEARCH
ENGINE MONOPOLY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 It was nearly a year ago when US District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that
Google had acted illegally to maintain a monopoly - over the next
several weeks, lawyers for Google and the Justice Department will face
off again to determine what penalties will be levied against Google.
Google maintains that it will appeal the decision once the remedies
phase of the trial is complete. The company argues that the Department
of Justice's proposed remedies would hurt American customers, the
economy, and US tech leadership and innovation.

 CRYPTO KNOCKS ON THE DOOR OF A BANKING WORLD THAT SHUT IT OUT (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 President Trump's pledge to make the US a bitcoin superpower has set
the stage for crypto to become more intertwined with the banking
system. Several crypto firms are planning to apply for bank charters
or licenses. Some are interested in national trust or industrial bank
charters, which would enable them to operate more like traditional
lenders, while others are after relatively narrow licenses that would
allow them to issue stablecoins. Firms that obtain a bank charter will
become subject to stricter regulatory oversight. 

 DOZENS OF NOBEL-WORTHY INNOVATIONS AWAITING BIOMANUFACTURING 2.0 (15
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Biomanufacturing is a fragmented field, but the diffusion of these
technologies is a 'when, not if' question. This article discusses more
than 40 Nobel-worthy technologies that could further the field. The
premise of synthetic biology remains compelling as its applications
are wide-ranging with large markets and the underlying tech continues
to improve non-linearly. Whoever figures out how to combine these
technologies will have access to massive markets.

 PYTHON'S NEW T-STRINGS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Python 3.14, which will ship in late 2025, will contain a feature
called template strings (t-strings) that opens the door to safer and
more flexible string processing in Python. f-strings have become a
very popular way to format strings and are being used for everything -
even when they shouldn't. t-strings are a generalization of f-strings
that must be processed before they can be used. This post provides a
quick overview of how to use the new feature. 

 EVENT-HIDDEN ARCHITECTURES (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Events are a useful mechanism for transmitting state and data among
application resources, but they are a miserable experience for
developers and operators alike. The event-driven approach was
necessary early in the decade but it isn't any longer. Today's modern
abstractions mean that developers don't need to learn the unique
quirks of low-level infrastructure or understand the overall
application architecture just to build or enhance their part of the
application. Event-hidden grants engineers new powers while
simplifying engineering. It enables developers to build feature-rich,
scaled, and distributed applications without having to interact with
events, queues, and the industry of patterns, frameworks, and
consultants that came with them.

 WHAT I'D DO AS A COLLEGE FRESHMAN IN 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While many are spooked by large language models, college freshmen
should still study computer science - being supported by AI tools is
not a substitute for mastery. Tech rewards leverage, not shortcuts.
Freshmen should optimize for momentum and stack useful skills,
relationships, and systems. Understand trends but don't chase them -
ride the ones that match your strengths and learn to take a step back
and aim for depth, clarity, and direction. 

 IMPACT, AGENCY, AND TASTE (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 High-leverage work has two interrelated components: agency (a
combination of initiative/proactiveness and relentlessness and
resourcefulness) and taste (a good intuition for what things will work
and what won't). These can be improved through practice. This article
contains specific advice on how to improve on these dimensions. It is
important to be able to reflect on your own work and thought processes
and figure out how to improve them.
