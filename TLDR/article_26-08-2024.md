 BOEING STARLINER RETURNING EMPTY AS NASA TURNS TO SPACEX TO BRING
ASTRONAUTS BACK FROM ISS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Boeing will return its Starliner capsule without the NASA astronauts
that it delivered to orbit. The two astronauts will return via
SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft on a mission launching on September 24.
They will stay at the International Space Station for about six more
months before flying home in February. The test was originally
intended to last about nine days. This decision was made due to NASA's
commitment to safety - Starliner's crew flight test faced problems,
most notably with its propulsion system. NASA officials still support
Boeing and Starliner will likely be able to launch with a crew again
someday. 

 SHOCKER: FRENCH MAKE SURPRISE ARREST OF TELEGRAM FOUNDER AT PARIS
AIRPORT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 French authorities have detained Pavel Durov, the founder of the
Telegram messaging app. They plan to hit him with charges related to
abetting terrorism, fraud, money laundering, and crimes against
children. There is a near-total lack of moderation on the platform,
making it a top tool for organized crime. Durov's arrest has led to
widespread panic in Russia - Telegram is used by Russian forces to
communicate, and Western intelligence services may be able to obtain
sensitive information about the Russian military if they gain access
to it.

 WORLD-FIRST LUNG CANCER VACCINE TRIALS LAUNCHED ACROSS SEVEN
COUNTRIES (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 BioNTech has begun trials for BNT116, an mRNA lung cancer vaccine, in
34 research sites across the UK, US, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain,
and Turkey. The vaccine works by presenting the immune system with
tumor markers to prime the body to fight cancer cells expressing those
markers. It aims to strengthen a person's immune response to cancer
while leaving healthy cells untouched. The treatment is simple to
deliver - patients receive a round of shots every week for six
consecutive weeks and then every three weeks for 54 weeks. 

 CHINA'S OWN TESLA OPTIMUS? BEIJING'S AMBITIONS IN HUMANOID ROBOTS IN
FULL DISPLAY AT EXPO (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Chinese technology companies unveiled more than two dozen humanoid
robots at the five-day 2024 World Robot Conference in Beijing last
week. The show attracted 400 industry experts and academics and more
than 160 domestic and overseas robotic firms. While there seems to be
growing interest in robots from consumers, there are still several
hurdles to overcome before their use can become widespread. These
include a lack of sufficient data to train the AI used in the robots,
limited use cases, and high prices.

 BUFFDB (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 buffdb is a lightweight and high-performance persistence layer for
gRPC. It is designed to be used in environments where bandwidth is
limited and performance is critical. buffdb uses protobuff as its
messaging format of choice but support for other formats is planned.
It has full support for SQLite and partial support for DuckDB and
RocksDB. 

 RUROCO (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 ruroco is a tool that lets users execute commands on a server by
sending UDP packets. It contains several security features that
prevent port scanning and clients running unauthorized commands. It
encrypts data sent from client to server using RSA and it runs server
software in a way that uses as little operating system rights as
possible. ruroco can be used for single packet authorization, enabling
webservices, and more.

 WHY DOES GETTING A JOB IN TECH SUCK RIGHT NOW? (IS IT AI?!?) (29
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A lot of new CS graduates are finding it really hard to get a job.
There is a massive confluence of factors, both on the demand and
supply side of the market, that are contributing to it being harder to
land a job in tech. There are more CS graduates than ever and
employers are hiring fewer software engineers. AI is not replacing
engineers' jobs yet and it probably won't happen for an incredibly
long time. This article looks at all these factors in detail. 

 MERCHANTS OF COMPLEXITY (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 It's hard to sell simple because it looks easy. Clever and
sophisticated beats basic and straightforward most days in the market.
These products imply there is something special, which allows them to
command premium prices. Tech companies tend to turn basic problems
people could easily solve for themselves quickly and cheaply into
challenges that only a sophisticated solution can solve - usually with
a subscription. People can escape this cycle by deciding that all the
extra complexity isn't worth it and daring to be basic.
