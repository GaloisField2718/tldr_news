 SUPREME COURT LEANS TOWARD UPHOLDING LAW THAT COULD BAN TIKTOK (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Supreme Court seems likely to uphold the law that would ban
TikTok in the US. A preliminary decision is expected within days.
There remains some uncertainty on how the court will handle the case,
especially with President-elect Donald Trump taking office a day after
the deadline for the law to take effect. The court has the authority
to temporarily block the law even if it ultimately rules against
TikTok. 

 ELON MUSK WANTS COURTS TO FORCE OPENAI TO AUCTION OFF A LARGE
OWNERSHIP STAKE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 One of Elon Musk's lawyers has called on the California and Delaware
attorneys general to force OpenAI to auction off a large ownership
stake. Musk has previously launched lawsuits to attempt to stop OpenAI
from restructuring to a for-profit company. He co-founded the startup
with Sam Altman and nine others in 2015. OpenAI has no plans for an
auction.

 JEFF BEZOS'S NEW GLENN ROCKET LAUNCH CANCELED AFTER HOURS OF DELAYS
(11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket launch at Cape Canaveral Space Force
Station in Florida was called off this morning after hours of delays.
As tall as a 32-story building, the rocket was set to launch on
January 10, but the launch was postponed due to choppy seas in the
Atlantic Ocean where the booster is supposed to land. New Glenn is
designed to carry larger satellites and other payloads than other
rockets in operation today. Its success could inject competition into
the rocket business, which is currently dominated by one company -
SpaceX.

It currently has two studies for its devices, one which enables

their minds and the other enables patients to control assistive
robotic arms.

 STATE OF CLOUD COSTS: SPENDING ON GPUS IS UP 40% YOY, NOW AT 14% OF
TOTAL EC2 COMPUTE (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Datadog analyzed AWS cloud cost data from hundreds of organizations
[9] to understand the impact of technology choices, patterns of cloud
resource usage, and participation in AWS discount programs. The
findings reflect changing priorities of engineering teams, and suggest
that organizations have further opportunities for cost optimization.

 INTRODUCING WERK 💅 (WEBSITE) [10] 

 werk is a simplistic and easy-to-use portable build system and
command runner. It solves several problems with `make` and `just`.
Developers just have to parse a Werkfile containing recipes to werk
and it will determine what the user wants to build, what the
dependencies are, and run programs to rebuild any outdated build
products in the right order. It uses a new language, but the language
is able to express the kind of things developers really want to
express in build scripts and fairly pleasant and readable. 

 APPLE IS KILLING SWIFT (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article looks at how modern programming languages are governed
and explains how Swift's dictatorial structure is uniquely terrible.
Swift was originally a passion project by Chris Lattner, the senior
director of dev tooling at Apple. The language has evolved into a
complicated mess - it now has 217 keywords. While Apple is
unambiguously the dictator of Swift, its incentives put the company at
odds with the open-source community. The company's updates to the
language show how much it doesn't care about the community.

 MARK ZUCKERBERG SLAMS APPLE ON ITS LACK OF INNOVATION AND ‘RANDOM
RULES' (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently criticized Apple's lackluster
innovation efforts and 'random rules' during an episode of the Joe
Rogan Experience podcast. He noted that while the iPhone was great, it
introduced a platform with a lot of arbitrary rules, and that the
company hasn't invented anything great in a while. He also said that
Apple's reasons for pushing back on letting other companies into its
ecosystem are invalid - the security problems could be solved by
building better security. Zuckerberg claims that Meta would double its
profits if Apple stopped applying its random rules. 

 AGI WILL NOT MAKE LABOR WORTHLESS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Fears about human labor being replaced by machines go back hundreds,
if not thousands, of years. These fears continue today with the rapid
progress of AI in several previously secure human domains. The amount
of intelligence competing in the average person's labor market has
increased by several orders of magnitude over the past few centuries,
but this did not turn low-skilled laborers into a permanently
unemployed underclass - in fact, their incomes increased a lot as they
specialized and traded with skilled workers. Human-level AGIs will
still face constraints, forcing them to trade with humans for other
services, just like skilled humans do.
