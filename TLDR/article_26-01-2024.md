 APPLE IS BRINGING SIDELOADING AND ALTERNATE APP STORES TO THE IPHONE
(5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple has announced plans to change rules for developers releasing
iOS software in the EU. Third-party app stores will be allowed on iOS
for the first time. The changes will arrive with iOS 17.6 in March.
Marketplaces will have to go through Apple's approval process and can
be set as the default on devices. Developers can choose to use Apple's
payment services or integrate third-party systems. All apps must still
be notarized by Apple, and distribution through third-party
marketplaces will still be managed by Apple's systems. Developers will
only be allowed to distribute a single version of their app across
different app stores. 

 NEW EMBEDDING MODELS AND API UPDATES (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI is launching new models, reducing prices for GPT-3.5 Turbo,
and introducing new ways for developers to manage API keys and
understand API usage. The new models include two new embedding models,
an updated GPT-4 Turbo preview model, an updated GPT-3.5 Turbo model,
and an updated text moderation model. The updated GPT-4 Turbo preview
model completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly than
previous preview models and is intended to reduce cases of 'laziness'.
OpenAI plans to launch GPT-4 Turbo with vision in general availability
in the coming months.

 RESEARCHERS SHOWCASE A SPEEDY NEW APPROACH TO PRINTING METAL (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A team at MIT has announced a new method of 3D printing metal that
prioritizes printing speeds and scale over resolution. It is capable
of printing large aluminum parts at least 10 times faster than
comparable metal additive manufacturing processes. The technique
utilizes a bed of 100-micron glass beads to create a structure into
which molten aluminum is deposited. The beads can stand intense
temperatures while allowing heat to quickly dissipate. While the final
product doesn't offer near the pinpoint accuracy of some other
methods, the technique's quick turnaround makes it a candidate for
revolutionizing the way metal printing and metal forming are currently
handled. 

 AIRBORNE INFECTION RISK PLUMMETS IN FACE OF METAL NANOPARTICLE SPRAY
(2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A new sprayable coating applied to standard air filters may help
protect against airborne respiratory infections like measles,
influenza, SARS, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. It provides a
greater than 99% antiviral activity while also completely stopping
bacterial growth. The spray doesn't interfere with the effectiveness
of filters doing their normal job of removing other particles from the
air. There are many other similar technologies in the works, but they
will all need more development before they become commercially
available.

 APPLE IS FINALLY ALLOWING FULL VERSIONS OF CHROME AND FIREFOX TO RUN
ON THE IPHONE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 iOS 17.4 will introduce a change that will allow alternative browser
engineers to run on iOS. Developers will have to be authorized by
Apple to switch engines, which involves meeting specific criteria and
committing to a number of ongoing privacy and security mitigations.
The change will only apply to people with EU-based accounts. EU users
will be presented with a new choice screen for choosing a default
browser when opening Safari for the first time. 

 ELON MUSK SAYS CHINESE ELECTRIC CAR BRANDS COULD ‚ÄòDEMOLISH‚Äô
RIVALS AS TESLA EARNINGS FALL (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Tesla has backed off its bullish sales targets due to growing EV
sales by rival brands. The company has been cutting prices for more
than a year to boost sales. It lost the lead in global EV sales to
Chinese automaker BYD in the fourth quarter of 2023. Elon Musk told
analysts on a call that Chinese carmakers will have significant
success outside of China. He believes that current trade barriers are
preventing Chinese car manufacturers from demolishing most other car
companies in the world.
