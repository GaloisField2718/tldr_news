 MICROSOFT‚ÄôS NEW ERA OF AI PCS WILL NEED A COPILOT KEY, SAYS INTEL
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Microsoft's new specifications for OEMs building AI PCs includes a
requirement that they must have a Copilot key. To be recognized as an
AI PC, OEM partners must also provide a combination of hardware and
software including a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), the latest CPUs and
GPUs, and access to Copilot. It is unclear what OEMs will get in
return for adhering to Microsoft's AI PC definition. Intel recognizes
some laptops without the Copilot key as AI PCs due to their integrated
NPUs. 

 APPLE‚ÄôS WWDC 2024 IS SET FOR JUNE 10TH (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference will start with a keynote on
June 10 and run through until June 14. This year's event should be
similar to previous years, with announcements likely focusing on the
company's fall software updates and new hardware. Apple has reportedly
spent millions per day training its own AI models and it has been
rumored to be courting news outlets for training content partnerships.
The company may be planning a deal with third parties to supply
cloud-based AI features. It may also be planning to open up an
ecosystem for AI developers to create deep integrations into its
devices.

 STARTUP PLANS LARGEST OCEAN GEOENGINEERING PLANT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Californian startup Ebb Carbon plans to use seawater to remove tons
of carbon dioxide from the air. Its pilot carbon dioxide removal
plant, codenamed Project Macoma, could start operations as soon as
this year. It will pump hundreds of thousands of liters of seawater
every day, splitting the water into acidic and alkaline streams using
an electrochemical process. The alkaline outflow mixes with carbon
dioxide in ambient seawater to create bicarbonate, a stable way to
store carbon. While the impact of the plant will be small, the
process, if scaled up, could help mitigate the effects of climate
change. 

 IT'S HEARTY, IT'S MEATY, IT'S MOLD (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 One of the most promising sources of alternative foods is fungi,
which contain nutritious proteins, fats, antioxidants, and flavor
molecules. Scientists are exploring the many possibilities for new
flavors and textures that can be made by modifying genes already
present in fungi, as opposed to introducing genes from wildly
different species. Researchers have modified a fungus called koji
mold, usually used in East Asia to ferment starches, to be more
meat-like, offering an alternative route for creating meat
substitutes. The approach can create meat substitutes without the
complex ingredients lists, costs, and technical difficulties of
cultured meat.

 WHAT COMPUTERS CANNOT DO: THE CONSEQUENCES OF TURING-COMPLETENESS (32
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article helps readers understand the limits of computers and
what computers cannot do. Most programmers seem to not understand
these hard limits or what they mean. Understanding Turing-completeness
and its consequences for our finite machines, which are technically
not Turing-complete, is important for programming. 

 WHY GOOGLE FAILED TO MAKE GPT-3 + WHY MULTIMODAL AGENTS ARE THE PATH
TO AGI ‚Äî WITH DAVID LUAN OF ADEPT (64 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article contains an interview with David Luan, one of OpenAI's
early hires, a past leader of Google's LLM efforts and co-leader of
Google Brain, and founder of Adept, one of the leading companies in
the AI agents space, where he discusses his time with early OpenAI and
how Adept is building agents that can do anything humans can do on a
computer. Google had a huge lead with AI in 2017, but it was OpenAI
that ended up making GPT 1/2/3. While Google's team created
Transformers, the company's internal processes made it difficult for
its researchers to get work done. OpenAI was able to beat Google
because it took big swings and focused.

 HERE‚ÄôS WHY AI SEARCH ENGINES REALLY CAN‚ÄôT KILL GOOGLE (11 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Google Search seems to be getting worse as AI tools get better.
Google is complex and people use it for many different things. Large
language model-based bots may be genuinely more useful than a page of
Google results in some cases, but it will be difficult for AI to
replace Google as the center of the web for most use cases. This
article looks at how search works and explains how Google is still
much better than LLM-based systems for the majority of queries. 

 HOW TO TRADE SOFTWARE FOR SMALL MONEY? (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 It's easy for system engineers to make something that is valuable and
widely used, but quite a lot harder to get paid for it. The
competition is often free software maintained by well-funded teams and
there is a community norm where it is seen to be mildly immoral to
charge money for software. Pricing models for systems software is also
tricky. This post looks at various options for pricing models. SaaS
software is likely more prevalent as VCs don't think that non-SaaS
companies make money.
