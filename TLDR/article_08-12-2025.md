 THE INSIDE STORY OF HOW NETFLIX WON THE WARNER BROS. AUCTION (18
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Netflix outmaneuvered Paramount to buy Warner Bros. in a deal that
may change Hollywood forever. The deal still needs to pass regulatory
scrutiny before it can pass, and there is plenty of opposition against
the deal. Paramount could still launch a hostile bid. This article
tells the story of the acquisition based on conversations with more
than a dozen individuals directly involved in the process.

 AFTER NEURALINK, MAX HODAK IS BUILDING SOMETHING EVEN WILDER (15
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Max Hodak co-founded Neuralink with Elon Musk in 2016. He served as
its president and essentially ran day-to-day operations. In 2021, he
left and co-founded Science Corp., a brain-computer interface company
that aims to build technologies that can reshape human consciousness.
Its first product is a procedure that restores 'form vision' to people
with advanced macular degeneration through a rice grain-sized computer
chip implanted directly in the retina. 

 THE BIG BLIND (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Zanskar is a company that uses advanced AI models to prospect for
geothermal sites. Its AI models recently discovered a massive
underground heat source in western Nevada. This is the third such
finding in Zanskar's short life. AI prospecting appears to be a
game-changer for geothermal energy, a market that many had previously
written off because finding heat sources was so challenging.

 HOW I KEEP UP WITH AI-GENERATED PRS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI can generate code really fast, but that code still needs to be
reviewed. Automated PR tools can help, but they're not sufficient.
This article presents a workflow that can cut the time it takes to
review AI-generated PRs significantly. The workflow uses AI to
summarize changes and identify potential issues while allowing the
developer to stay in control of the final output. 

 ESTIMATES – A NECESSARY EVIL? (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Developers find it difficult to estimate. A lot of the time, it can
be difficult to see why the estimate is even important. Product owners
see estimates as a crucial piece of the puzzle that helps in planning
the short and long-term life cycle of a product. It is best to work in
a way that allows developers to be transparent and continuously
communicate updated estimates as development progresses.

 ANOTHER DEEPSEEK MOMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 ZTE's Nubia M153 is a smartphone that runs ByteDance's DoubaoAI agent
at the OS level. The agent has complete control over the phone. It can
see the UI, choose/download apps, tap/type, make calls, and run
multi-step task chains. The Doubao model is a massive, sparse Mixture
of Experts model with full text and vision support. This thread
contains several videos that show what the phone is capable of. 

 I WASTED 8 YEARS OF MY LIFE IN CRYPTO (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Bitcoin will probably hit a million one day, but that is irrelevant
to the financial games the industry is churning out. The industry
mentality is incredibly toxic and will likely lead to the long-term
collapse of social mobility for the younger generation. It is up to us
to find the courage to resist the pull of worthless games. Sometimes,
it is better to be right than to make money.
