 CHINA'S FIRST SPACE TOURISM VENTURE SELLS INITAL PAIR OF TICKETS (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Deep Blue Aerospace used a livestream on Chinese e-commerce site
Taobao to sell two tickets on its first suborbital flights. At just
¬•1,000,000 ($140,000), the seats were at a deep discount compared to
the expected cost of ¬•1,500,000 ($210,000) per seat. The flight is
not expected to launch for another three years or so. The livestream,
which was the first time space tourism tickets have gone on public
sale in China, attracted an audience of three million viewers. 

 WE'VE FOUND THE SOURCE OF MOST METEORITES (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 70% of meteorites come from three collisions that occurred in the
asteroid belt within the past 40 million years. An exhaustive study by
an international team of scientists has tracked down the sources of
most meteorites falling on Earth. The team gathered data and ran
simulations to reveal how collisions produce families of asteroids
that start in similar orbits and how those fragments spread out over
time. Their work still needs to be validated, but it explains several
key observables with a single model.

 WE'RE FORKING FLUTTER. THIS IS WHY (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Flutter began as a UI toolkit for mobile only before expanding to the
web and desktop platforms. Despite the project's massive expansion of
scope and responsibility, the Flutter team has only marginally
increased its size. Flutter has been forked to help expand its
available labor and accelerate development. The Flock fork will remain
constantly up to date with Flutter but add important bug fixes and
popular community features. The Flutter team can choose to add these
bug fixes and features on their own schedule. 

 OPEN-SOURCE AI MUST REVEAL ITS TRAINING DATA, PER NEW OSI DEFINITION
(4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Open Source Initiative (OSI) has released its official definition
of 'open' artificial intelligence. For an AI system to be considered
truly open source, it must provide the complete code used to build and
run the AI, access to details about the data used to train the AI so
others can understand and recreate it, and the settings and weights
from the training. The definition directly challenges Meta's Llama,
which has restrictions on commercial use and does not provide access
to training data. Meta claims that it restricts access to its training
data due to safety concerns, but critics say the company is just
minimizing its legal liability and safeguarding its competitive
advantage.

 A MYSTERIOUS NEW IMAGE GENERATION MODEL HAS APPEARED (1 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 red_panda is a mysterious new image generation model that is beating
other top models. The model is over 100 times faster than OpenAI's
DALL-E3. It is unknown which company made the model and when it will
be released. AI companies are increasingly using community benchmarks
to drum up anticipation ahead of announcements, so it is likely a
reveal will be coming soon. 

 AIRBNB CEO BRIAN CHESKY ON THE GOSPEL OF STEVE JOBS AND WHAT FOUNDER
MODE REALLY MEANS (68 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article contains a transcript of an interview with Airbnb
cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky, who made a lot of waves earlier this
year when he started talking about something called 'founder mode'.
Chesky spends a lot of time specifically obsessing over company
structure and decision-making. In the interview, Chesky talks about
founder mode and what he thinks it means. Founder mode isn't about
micromanagement or pure swagger - good leaders need to get into the
details while still delegating and trusting their teams to make
decisions independently of them.
