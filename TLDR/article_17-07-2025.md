 LUXURY VACATION HOMES ARE A $1.3 TRILLION MARKET. INVESTORS ARE
PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO ONE COMPANY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The luxury vacation home market might not be on your radar - but it
should be. Wealthy Americans are on the lookout for exotic vacation
homes, and new platforms are popping up to meet this demand.

Pacaso [4] is a leader in this space, and is pioneering a co-ownership
model that's increasingly popular with buyers.

THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN. After ~200 homes delivered, $110M+ in gross
profits, and securing funding from top investors including Greycroft
and Maveron, Pacaso is now raising up to $75M in an open-to-the-public
round [4] (SEC-qualified).

 TESLA REVEALS MODEL 3 PLUS AND MODEL YL IN CHINA AS PRICE WAR HEATS
UP (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla has applied for a new sales license with China's Ministry of
Information Technology for a longer-range Model 3 Plus sedan. It has
also applied for a license for the Model YL, a longer version of the
electric SUV with three rows of seats. The new Model 3 Plus features a
single motor on the rear axle and an LG-supplied NMC (nickel cobalt
manganese) battery. It is expected to have a longer range than the
other versions of the electric sedan. The Model YL, which will be
available in China this fall, has six seats and is 7 inches longer and
over an inch taller than the current Model Y. 

 OPENAI WORKING ON PAYMENT CHECKOUT SYSTEM WITHIN CHATGPT (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is planning to integrate a payment checkout system into
ChatGPT to take a cut from online product sales made through the
chatbot. The move would open up a new source of revenue for OpenAI,
which lost around $5 billion last year. OpenAI has been presenting
early versions of the system to brands and discussing financial terms.
ChatGPT currently displays suggested products and links that take
users to online retailers' websites.

 INSIDE THE SECRET HQ OF ONE OF NEURALINK'S BIGGEST COMPETITORS (22
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Synchron's Stentrode brain-computer interface has been implanted in
10 people since 2019. The company differentiates itself with a
minimally invasive implantation process: the Stentrode does not
require drilling into the skull. It is instead inserted into a vein
above the motor cortex, so it's near the brain but not directly on it.
This article takes a look at the Stentrode and how it compares to
Neuralink's N1 implant. It also looks at the wider industry and the
state of other related technologies. 

 DRONES, AI, AND ROBOT PICKERS: MEET THE FULLY AUTONOMOUS FARM (9
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Advances in artificial intelligence mean that the autonomous farm is
finally possible. Most of the technology required to power an
autonomous revolution in agriculture already exists or is nearly ready
for market launch. However, cost and connectivity are still major
hurdles to overcome. This article takes a look at some of the
essential components in the vision of the autonomous farm.

 PGACTIVE (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 pgactive is a PostgreSQL replication extension for creating an
active-active database. PostgreSQL added native support for logical
replication in PostgreSQL 10 in 2017, but it still requires additional
features to fully support an active-active replication topology. Its
design makes it possible to build the necessary components for
supporting active-active replication in an extension while the
development community continues to add it into the upstream project. 

 DOCUMENTING WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO SUPPORT (AND NOT) (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Sometimes, you just need to write down what you're willing to do and
what you're not. This allows you to point to a document that sets
expectations. There are issues that aren't worth supporting because
it's a waste of time - having a document to refer to allows you to
easily explain the reasons for refusing support without seeming rude.

 LINUX BREAKS 5% DESKTOP SHARE IN U.S., SIGNALING OPEN-SOURCE SURGE
AGAINST WINDOWS AND MACOS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Linux has finally crossed the 5% threshold in desktop market share
within the US. The surge in use reflects broader dissatisfaction with
dominant players like Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS. It is being
driven by factors like privacy concerns, customization demands, and
the rising cost of proprietary ecosystems. Advancements in
user-friendly distributions such as Ubuntu and Fedora have lowered
barriers for non-technical users. 

 HUMANS ARE SOUNDING MORE LIKE CHATGPT, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Humans are increasingly subtly mirroring AI language patterns by
using 'GPT words' (common words used by ChatGPT, like 'delve' and
'underscore') in conversation. A new study suggests humans are
starting to talk more like AI, a trend that started when ChatGPT came
along a couple of years ago. The study tracked the frequency of GPT
words in YouTube videos and podcast episodes from before and after
ChatGPT's launch. Its results are a reminder that AI's influence
extends beyond just tools and into the very fabric of how we
communicate.
