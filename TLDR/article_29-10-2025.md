 OPENAI COMPLETES FOR-PROFIT TRANSITION, PUSHING MICROSOFT ABOVE $4
TRILLION VALUATION (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has successfully converted to a more traditional corporate
structure. It has turned its for-profit subsidiary into a
public-benefit corporation. The new structure will make it easier for
the company to raise money and attract talent, and could clear the
path for an initial public offering. OpenAI continues to face
litigation over its corporate status. Microsoft owns a 27% stake in
the new public-benefit corporation. 

 TESLA EYES INTERNAL CEO CANDIDATES IF MUSK LEAVES OVER $1 TRILLION
PAY VOTE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla is prepared to name a new Chief Executive Officer from inside
the company if shareholders reject Elon Musk's proposed $1 trillion
pay package and he steps down. The unprecedented pay package will be
voted on at the company's annual meeting on November 6. It is designed
to incentivize Musk and ensure that development around AI and other
new products happens within Tesla rather than with one of Musk's
multiple other ventures. Shareholders will also vote on whether to
invest in xAI at the annual meeting.

 NVIDIA AND UBER SAY THEY'RE BUILDING A 100,000-VEHICLE ROBOTAXI
NETWORK (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nvidia and Uber plan to start rolling out a fleet of robotaxis in
2027. The companies are aiming for 100,000 vehicles, but there is no
timeline yet for when they will reach that level of scale. The
robotaxis will use Nvidia's latest in-vehicle computer, the Drive AGX
Hyperion 10, which Nvidia claims makes cars ready for level-4
automation. It will enable vehicles to drive completely autonomously
within designated areas. 

 I TRIED THE ROBOT THAT'S COMING TO LIVE WITH YOU. IT'S STILL PART

offer a $499 monthly rental plan with a six-month minimum commitment.

representatives to get tasks done. Videos of the robot in action are

 HOW AGENTIC PAYMENTS ARE REINVENTING A 90S INTERNET STANDARD (21
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 HTTP's placeholder status code, 402: Payment Required, was meant to
make payments as seamless as loading an image or video. It has been
left undefined for years. Instead of protocol-native micropayments,
the web economy was forced down the path of advertising, walled
gardens, and awkward credit card forms. HTTP 402 has recently
resurfaced as the foundation of an emerging agent-driven economy. New
standards like x402 and h402 may finally make payments as native and
invisible as information itself. 

 THE NEW CALCULUS OF AI-BASED CODING (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Feature flags are a powerful mechanism for services delivering new
capabilities. They can be especially effective in helping control the
blast radius in case of unforeseen problems with new features.
However, they come with operational and cognitive costs, so it's
important to have a way to bound the number of feature flags within
the code base at any point in time. Feature flag toggles are no
different than any other code changes, as they change the behavior of
the service, so consider using the same mechanisms for deployment.

 META'S $75B AI INFRASTRUCTURE BET: INSIDE THE BIGGEST CLOUD DEALS OF
2025 (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Meta is now spending more than a third of every dollar earned on AI
infrastructure. The company announced $75.5 billion in infrastructure
deals in just three months - more than most countries spend on their
entire tech sector in a decade. It is betting that AI will improve ad
targeting, improve new products, and create infrastructure business.
However, if AI doesn't deliver proportional revenue growth, Meta is
stuck with $600 billion in sunk costs, 16-year lease commitments, and
massive depreciation expenses. 

 OPENAI'S PROMISE TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA HELPED CLEAR THE PATH FOR ITS
IPO (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI spent months making the case to regulators that it was the
economic heart of the California economy, and that it would be willing
to leave if its plan to convert to a simpler corporate structure was
blocked. When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman spoke with California Attorney
General Rob Bonta nearly two weeks ago to discuss the issue, Altman
made it clear that he was committed to his home state and that OpenAI
wouldn't sue it or leave it. The discussion proved decisive - Bonta's
office ended its extended investigation into the company. The final
deal included a pledge for OpenAI to remain in California and expand
its presence there.
