 WHY THIS PRE-IPO AI MARKETING COMPANY'S VALUATION INCREASED 1700% IN
3 YEARS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Digital ad spend attracted a record $1.1TN in 2024. But most
placements still miss the mark – they interrupt, frustrate, and fail
to deliver value.

RAD Intel [4] Backed by Adobe and Fidelity, their proprietary AI helps
brands like MGM, Hasbro, and Skechers cut through the noise by
analyzing what audiences actually care about—and crafting messages
that _land_.

The result? Up to 3.5x better ROI.

RAD is still pre-IPO, and the share price is $0.55 [4].

THE PRICE CHANGES APRIL 10, so get in before [4] "too late" becomes
the headline.

 AMAZON'S NEW AI AGENT WILL SHOP THIRD-PARTY SITES FOR YOU (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Amazon is testing a new AI shopping agent with a subset of users. The
'Buy for Me' feature displays products from other websites and allows
users to request to purchase the products without ever leaving the
Amazon Shopping app. Amazon's AI shopping agent visits the site and
purchases items, filling out users' details automatically. The agent
is powered by Amazon's Nova AI models. Amazon says that the feature
uses encryption to securely insert users' billing information on
third-party sites and that it can't see what users are ordering from
outside of its platform.

 FIRST TOKAMAK COMPONENT INSTALLED IN A COMMERCIAL FUSION PLANT (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Commonwealth Fusion recently installed the first component of its
tokamak, the cryostat base. Construction is expected to wrap up about
a year from now, after which there will be about a year of
commissioning the hardware. Fusion experiments are planned for 2027.
The company is on track to see plasma well in advance of ITER, a big
tokamak that is expected to produce more energy than required to run
it. 

 STARLINER'S FLIGHT TO THE SPACE STATION WAS FAR WILDER THAN MOST OF
US THOUGHT (25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams boarded Boeing's Starliner spacecraft
on June 5 last year. The mission had faced multiple delays before the
launch. Starliner lost four thrusters as it flew up toward the
International Space Station, requiring Wilmore to take control of the
vehicle. Its approach to the space station was risky, but it wasn't
safe to come home either. This article contains an interview with
Wilmore and Williams where they talk about the experience.

 SENIOR DEVELOPER SKILLS IN THE AI AGE: LEVERAGING EXPERIENCE FOR
BETTER RESULTS (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI coding assistants, when properly guided, can dramatically enhance
development productivity. It is necessary to apply traditional
software engineering best practices to this new technology. Developers
can harness the power of AI while maintaining code quality and
architectural integrity by providing well-structured requirements,
implementing appropriate guardrails, and using file-based keyframing.
Time-tested practices developed through hard-earned human experience
are more valuable than ever in the age of AI-assisted development.
