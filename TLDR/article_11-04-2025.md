 CHATGPT'S MEMORY CAN NOW REFERENCE ALL PAST CONVERSATIONS, NOT JUST
WHAT YOU TELL IT TO (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is rolling out improvements to ChatGPT's memory and making it
a default for the chatbot to reference past conversations. The chatbot
will now draw on past conversations to deliver more relevant and
useful responses across all modalities on the platform. While AI long
term memory could be useful for many tasks, some users are concerned
with the privacy implications of the feature. Users are able to turn
the feature on or off in ChatGPT settings. 

 GOOGLE PIXEL 9A REVIEW: ALL THE PHONE YOU NEED (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's new Pixel 9a has most of what makes flagship Pixel phones so
good at a $499 price point. While the cheaper price point means a
trade-off in materials, charging, and the on-device AI capabilities
the device has compared to its pricier siblings, none of those are
deal-breakers. The modestly-priced phone, which will have lengthy
support, could be the perfect purchase in a period of uncertainty for
imported gadgets.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 NEUTRINOS ARE SHRINKING, AND THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR PHYSICS (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new study published in the journal Science sets a new upper limit
for the mass of a neutrino. Neutrinos are prolific across the cosmos -
they are created virtually anytime atomic nuclei snap together or rip
apart. They carry no electric charge and are notoriously difficult to
detect. Learning more about neutrinos will help cosmologists fill in
more knowledge about the universe, including how galaxies clustered
together and what influences the expansion of the cosmos. Uncovering
the exact values of the mass of neutrinos could lead to new physics. 

 CELLS ARE SWAPPING THEIR MITOCHONDRIA. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR OUR
HEALTH? (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mitochondrial transfer - when mitochondria skip from cell to cell on
demand - has been observed in a wide variety of cells and in organisms
as diverse as yeast, molluscs, and rodents. It isn't clear yet why
mitochondria are so mobile, but there are hints that cells donate
their mitochondria to neighbors during times of need. The implications
for human health are still a mystery. It is unclear whether
mitochondrial transfer happens inside the human body.

 SMARTFUNC (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 smartfunc turns docstrings into LLM-functions. It features schemas,
inner function prompt engineering, support for async functions, and a
debug mode. A video demo is available in the repository. 

 .LOCALHOST DOMAINS (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 It's possible to configure private, custom domains for local webapps,
so instead of having to remember and type 'localhost:4333', you can
simply navigate to 'appname.localhost'. The process involves setting
up each app as a launchd daemon that listens to a unique port,
configuring /etc/hosts to redirect traffic to 127.0.0.1, and then
redirecting traffic from 127.0.0.1 to the right port for the domain.
This post provides more details on the process.

 THIS IS HOW APPLE'S BIG SIRI SHAKE-UP HAPPENED, PER REPORT (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Apple experienced a major internal shake-up related to Siri last
month. The company's struggles in AI were partly tied to its militant
stance on user privacy and also poor leadership. Members of the Siri
team at Apple were surprised at the features that the company demoed
at WWDC last year as they didn't even have working prototypes. There
seems to be more optimism within Apple that Siri is in good hands now.


 AI 50: AI AGENTS MOVE BEYOND CHAT (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Companies are using AI agents and reasoning models to take on real
enterprise workflows. Startups are moving from AI that merely responds
to prompts to AI that solves problems and completes entire workflows,
producing real business results. Startups focused on robots have made
meaningful strides as they integrate models built using transformers
with hardware. Companies this year will prove that AI can be trusted
with meaningful workloads and deliver real results - next year,
enterprise gains will start spilling into everyday life.
