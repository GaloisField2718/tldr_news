 GOOGLE LAUNCHES GEMINI ULTRA, ITS MOST POWERFUL LLM YET (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google has retired the Bard name and rebranded it to Gemini for the
launch of Gemini Ultra, its most capable large language model yet.
Gemini Ultra is available through a new $20 Google One tier that also
includes 2TB of storage as well as the rest of Google One's feature
set. The feature will work in Google Workspace apps. More information
about API access for the Ultra model will be shared in the coming
weeks. 

 SPACEX TESTS USING DRONE SHIPS TO SUPPORT STARLINK COVERAGE AT SEA (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX is using its drone ships, designed to act as landing pads for
rockets, as gateway stations to bolster Starlink's cover at sea. The
company applied for a temporary FCC license last month to test
operating up to 12 earth station antennas over the drone ships. SpaceX
hasn't revealed details about how the drone ships will serve as
backhaul without dedicated fiber connections. The FCC is still
weighing the application.

 THE MOST PROMISING AI SMART GLASSES ARE FROM A BRAND YOU'VE NEVER
HEARD OF (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Brilliant Labs' Frame smart glasses feature an integrated multimodal
AI assistant. It lets users navigate and interact with the physical
world with multimodal generative AI agents. The glasses use a wide
range of AI models to answer questions. Frame has a front-facing
sensor to capture images to answer questions, but it discards the data
shortly after. It requires a smartphone with an internet connection to
operate. A video introducing the device is available in the article. 

 ALL NEURAL NETWORKS. ALL AUTONOMOUS. ALL 1X SPEED (4 MINUTE READ) [8]


 1X deployed its system to learn motor behaviors end-to-end from
vision using neural networks in 2023. It recently released a video
sharing some of the new capabilities its humanoid androids have
learned purely end-to-end from data. The video shows the robots
picking up items from shelves and placing them into containers, moving
objects from the floor to a box, and performing various other tasks.
Every behavior seen in the video is controlled by a single
vision-based neural network that emits actions at 10Hz. All
capabilities in the video were trained by 1X's android operators.

 LLRT (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Low Latency Runtime (LLRT) is a JavaScript runtime designed to
address the growing demand for fast and efficient Serverless
applications. It offers up to over 10x faster startup and up to 2x
overall lower cost compared to other JavaScript runtimes running on
AWS Lambda. LLRT only supports a fraction of Node.js APIs and is not a
drop-in replacement for Node.js. It conserves both CPU and memory
resources by not incorporating a JIT compiler. 

 INTRODUCING SUDO FOR WINDOWS! (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sudo for Windows is a new way for users to run elevated commands
directly from an unelevated console session. Microsoft has
open-sourced the project and added the feature to the Windows 11
Insider Preview Build 26052. The feature currently supports three
configuration options (In a new window, Input closed, and Inline) that
can be set through a drop-down menu in the Settings page for the
feature. A link to gsudom, an alternative implementation of sudo with
additional functionality, is available.

 THE ONE-PERSON BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman recently said that a one-person
billion-dollar company may soon emerge. This will supposedly be made
possible with AI tools as work could be outsourced to an army of
artificial intelligence agents. The size of the distribution required,
coupled with the ability of anyone to make anything with the same AI
tools, makes the one-person billion-dollar company incredibly
challenging if not impossible. There's a significant opportunity for
ambitious people to build solo businesses in the $1-10 million ARR
range, but after that, it's probably best to hire people to help grow
anyway. 

 HOW GOOD IS GOOGLE GEMINI ADVANCED? (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Gemini Advanced, recently rebranded from Bard Advanced, is a
$19.99/month service (with a two-month free trial) available in 150
countries in English. It is multimodal and has data analysis
capabilities and improved reasoning compared to Gemini Pro, the free
version of the model. Gemini Advanced is a GPT-4 class model, but it
doesn't obviously blow away GPT-4 in the benchmarks. It is better than
GPT-4 in some cases, but GPT-4 is still more sophisticated about using
code and accomplishes a number of hard verbal tasks better. Both
models still fail and hallucinate at times.
