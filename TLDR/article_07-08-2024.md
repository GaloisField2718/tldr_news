 OPENAI CO-FOUNDER JOHN SCHULMAN SAYS HE WILL LEAVE AND JOIN RIVAL
ANTHROPIC (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI co-founder John Schulman recently announced that he will leave
OpenAI to join Anthropic to deepen his focus on AI alignment. The move
comes less than three months after OpenAI disbanded a superalignment
team that focused on ensuring that AI systems can be controlled.
Schulman has worked at OpenAI since receiving a Ph.D. from the
University of California, Berkeley in 2016. Greg Brockman, another
co-founder of OpenAI and its president, announced on Monday that he
was taking a sabbatical for the rest of the year.

 FIGURE REDESIGNS ITS HUMANOID ROBOT FROM THE GROUND UP FOR SLICK NEW
F.02 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figure's second-generation humanoid robot is aimed at production
lines in commercial settings. Its engineers took a ground-up hardware
and software redesign approach to developing the robot that included
upgrades to the AI systems, computer vision, battery pack,
electronics, sensors, and actuators. The robot now has microphones and
speakers that allow it to have one-on-one conversations with humans. A
video trailer from Figure showing off the robot is available. 

 CHINA BEGINS LAUNCHING A MEGACONSTELLATION, AND IT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE
STARLINK (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are two serious efforts underway in China to develop a rival to
SpaceX's Starlink project. The first batch of 18 satellites for one of
those projects launched into low-Earth orbit on Tuesday on a Long
March 4A rocket. Besides providing civilians with internet, the
network could be used for military applications and as a diplomatic
tool. The full deployment of these networks will require a significant
increase in China's launch capacity.

 PREDICTIONS FOR THE FUTURE OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (2 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Software engineering will likely look radically different in a few
years. The introduction of coding agents that complete tasks
end-to-end will change how engineers work, making them more like
engineering managers who spend more time on the higher level parts of
coding. This will have many effects, like creating more software, more
engineers, and productivity gains for companies. Marketing may even
start being directed to AI agents as companies try to get them to
choose their products over a rival's. 

 OPENAI: INTRODUCING STRUCTURED OUTPUTS IN THE API (5 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 OpenAI has introduced two new ways to guarantee valid inputs. The
first is a new 'strict' option for function definitions and the second
is a new feature option for the 'response_format' field that lets
users pass a JSON schema to specify a required output. OpenAI's models
will now return a 'refusal' message if a model denies a request. The
new gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model is 50% cheaper on inputs and 33% on
outputs compared to gpt-4o-2024-05-13. It also supports up to 16,384
tokens, up from 4,096.

 RETURN-TO-OFFICE MANDATES HURT EMPLOYEE RETENTION, PRODUCTIVITY,
SURVEY SAYS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Employee retention improves when employees have a say in where they
work. A recent survey on employee satisfaction found that those who
are allowed to choose between in-person, remote, or hybrid work are
three times more likely to want to stay at their company. It also
found that workers facing return-to-office mandates are 14 times less
likely to 'quit and stay'. Several other studies have found similar
results. 

 DELL MAKES CUTS TO BOOST AI PIVOT, REPORTEDLY LAYING OFF 12,500

 Dell is cutting around 10% of its workforce. Impacted employees were
mostly in the company's sales and marketing teams. The company is
switching up its sales teams to put more emphasis on AI products and
changing how it handles data center sales. This is the second round of
mass layoffs for the company in the past 15 months.
