ONE-DAY GAIN EVER (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nvidia recorded the largest-ever single-day jump in market value a
day after it announced its quarterly earnings and a sales outlook that
exceeded analysts' expectations. The company's value rose 16.4%,
adding $272 billion to its market cap. Its market cap now stands at
$1.94 trillion. The previous record was set by Meta just two weeks ago
- Meta added $205 billion to its market cap after it beat earnings
forecasts and announced its first dividend.

UTAH (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Varda Space Industries' in-space drug manufacturing capsule has
finally returned to Earth after more than eight months in space. The
capsule landed in the Utah desert, marking the successful conclusion
of Varda's first experimental mission to grow pharmaceuticals in
orbit. This was the first time a commercial company landed a
spacecraft on US soil. The mission launched in June last year and was
supposed to just be a month long, but it was extended due to issues
obtaining a commercial reentry license.

 THE MOBILE S-CURVE ENDS, AND THE AI S-CURVE BEGINS (12 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 S-curve products are fueled by novelty. This is why there is a rush
of new users without much marketing effort whenever there are major
tech releases. There is both high growth and high churn in the early
stages of an S-curve. The skills needed to succeed in a late S-curve
market are very different. Investors will be looking for products that
are radically different. A good design can help differentiate late
S-curve products. 

 BLUESKY OPENS UP FEDERATION, LETTING ANYONE RUN THEIR OWN SERVER (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Bluesky, a federated social network that began as a project funded by
Twitter under Jack Dorsey, is now allowing anyone to run their own
server. Its decentralized model uses a different protocol than the one
that Mastodon uses. Federation allows users to host their own data and
accounts and make their own rules. There is a growing interest in
federated social networks as consumers want to have more control over
their personal data.
