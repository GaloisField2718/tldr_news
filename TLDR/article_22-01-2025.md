 OPENAI TEAMS UP WITH SOFTBANK AND ORACLE ON $500B DATA CENTER PROJECT
(5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, along with others, have teamed up to
build multiple data centers for AI in the US. The joint venture,
called The Stargate Project, will create hundreds of thousands of jobs
and secure American leadership in AI. It will begin with a large data
center project in Texas before eventually expanding to other states.
The companies expect to pour up to $500 billion into the venture over
the next four years. OpenAI is reportedly aggressively building out a
team of chip designers and engineers to create an AI chip for running
models - it could arrive in data centers as soon as 2026.

days. Other potential TikTok buyers include Elon Musk, Amazon, Oracle,
and a syndicate headed by billionaire Frank McCourt.

 DEEPMIND'S HASSABIS SEES AI-DESIGNED DRUG TRIALS THIS YEAR (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Isomorphic Labs' Nobel Prize-winning chief executive officer says
that the company will hopefully have some AI-designed drugs in
clinical trials by the end of the year. It is working on shortening
the drug discovery process from a decade or more to just weeks or
months. The company, created in 2021 to commercialize Google
DeepMind's AlphaFold AI for drug discovery, announced strategic
research collaboration agreements with Eli Lilly & Co. and Novartis AG
last year. AlphaFold can model a range of molecular structures and
predict how they interact with each other. 

 417-MEGAPIXEL ANDROMEDA GALAXY PANORAMA TOOK OVER A DECADE TO MAKE (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Astronomers have completed the most comprehensive survey of the
Andromeda galaxy so far and created a 417-megapixel panorama. The
massive 42,208 by 9,870-pixel panorama took over a decade to create
and includes more than 600 photos. It is the largest photo mosaic ever
created using Hubble Space Telescope observations. The photo shows 200
million stars, a fraction of the estimated one trillion stars in the
system. It will help scientists learn more about Andromeda's history.
A video showing highlights from the mosaic is available in the
article.

 ARE LLMS MAKING STACKOVERFLOW IRRELEVANT? (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The volume of questions asked on StackOverflow fell quickly after
ChatGPT's release in November 2022. The drop continues into 2025 at an
alarming speed. The site has not seen so few questions asked monthly
since 2009. Its decline actually started before ChatGPT - the release
of the chatbot merely sped up the decline. StackOverflow's lack of
innovation may have resulted in the initial drop in questions. The
drop in questions indicates that trouble is ahead. 

 PERPLEXITY LAUNCHES SONAR, AN API FOR AI SEARCH (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Perplexity's Sonar API allows developers to build generative AI
search tools into their applications. There is a base version that is
cheaper and faster and a pricier version that's better for tough
questions. Developers will be able to customize the sources that the
AI search engine pulls from. Perplexity claims to be offering the
cheapest AI search API on the market. Its models reportedly outperform
leading models on a benchmark that measures factual correctness.

 STRIPE CUTS 300 JOBS IN PRODUCT, ENGINEERING, AND OPERATIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Stripe has cut about 3.5% of its workforce, mostly in product,
engineering, and operations. Despite this, the company plans to
continue hiring and increase its headcount by 17% by the end of the
year. The payments company is currently valued at about $70 billion in
private markets. Stripe's founders have intentionally steered clear of
public markets and have given no indication of whether an offering is
on the near-term horizon. Total payment volume at the company passed
$1 trillion in 2023.
