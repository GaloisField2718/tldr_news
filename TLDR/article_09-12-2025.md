 SAM ALTMAN'S SPRINT TO CORRECT OPENAI'S DIRECTION AND FEND OFF GOOGLE
(15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made the call last week to pause the company's
side projects for eight weeks and focus on improving ChatGPT. The
decision was a major strategic course correction. Altman instructed
employees to boost ChatGPT through the better use of user signals.
OpenAI is set to release a new model this week, and it also plans to
release another model in January with better images, improved speed,
and a better personality, after which it will end the 'code red'.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 CURRENT FUEL MIX AND USES (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 We're in the middle of a period of rapid transition in energy. Solar
is decosting at an accelerating rate, coal is shrinking, and nuclear
is flat. Primary production will soon be mostly solar. Batteries will
be everywhere, and the grid will shrink. Datacenters, which are
already building their own captive power plants, will become power
sources for their communities. Substantial cost improvements are still
needed to make space AI competitive.

 AI, LLMS, AND OBSERVABILITY: 7 KEY INSIGHTS FROM GOOGLE'S DIRECTOR OF
AI AND DATADOG'S VP OF ENGINEERING (SPONSOR) [9]

Engineering Sajid Mehmood, sat down to discuss the current and future
states of AI, ML, and LLMs on Google Cloud. This guide distills the

 HAS THE COST OF BUILDING SOFTWARE JUST DROPPED 90%? (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 We are in the early stages of a once-in-a-generation shift. The
economics of building software have changed dramatically with agentic
coding. Previous assertions that LLMs make too many mistakes or can't
understand codebases or frameworks are rapidly becoming completely
false. The technology is going to totally transform the software
development industry. 

 LLM WEIGHTS VS THE PAPERCUTS OF CORPORATE (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Model weight first companies are companies where the majority of the
software was code-generated. These companies do not require as much
context engineering and do not need to adhere to classical principles
as much as corporate companies. They achieve much higher
velocity/productivity/success rates using AI because they are not
forcing models to follow pre-existing dogma. Companies having problems
with AI are likely trying to bend the technology to their whim rather
than working with it.

 PARAMOUNT SKYDANCE LAUNCHES HOSTILE BID FOR WBD ‘TO FINISH WHAT WE
STARTED,' CEO ELLISON TELLS CNBC (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Paramount Skydance is launching a hostile bid to buy Warner Bros.
Discovery. It will go straight to shareholders with an all-cash, $30
per share offer. The offer is supported by equity financing from the
Ellison family, Middle Eastern financing partners, Jared Kushner's
Affinity Partners, and other parties. Those partners have agreed to
forgo any governance rights as part of their investment. The
modifications allow the deal to be outside of the jurisdiction of the
Committee of Foreign Investment in the US.
