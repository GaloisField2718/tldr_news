 ORACLE, OPENAI SIGN MASSIVE $300 BILLION CLOUD COMPUTING DEAL (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI will purchase $300 billion in computing power from Oracle over
roughly five years. The deal, which far outstrips OpenAI's current
revenue, is one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed. It will
require 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity, the amount consumed by
roughly four million homes. Oracle's share price recently surged,
increasing its Chairman Larry Ellison's wealth by more than $100
billion. OpenAI and Oracle's contract will start in 2027. 

 ELON MUSK MULLS MAKING STARLINK A 'GLOBAL CARRIER' AFTER ECHOSTAR
DEAL (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk said during a podcast on Tuesday night that Starlink could
become a mobile carrier. SpaceX recently reached a $17 billion deal to
buy radio spectrum from EchoStar, BoostMobile's parent company. The
deal will give SpaceX access to several 1.9GHz and 2GHz bands in the
US. Some hardware changes may be required as these frequencies are not
supported in current phones.

 MUSK SAYS SPACEX TO FLY BIGGER, FULLY REUSABLE STARSHIP IN 2026 (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX is readying a bigger version of Starship capable of carrying
more than 100 tons of payload to orbit. Its current iteration of the
vehicle has a capacity of about 35 tons. SpaceX is aiming to
demonstrate full reusability for Starship next year. 

 CONSTRUCTION ROBOT PRINTING FLOOR PLAN: THE FUTURE OF BUILDING DESIGN
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Construction robots are revolutionizing the industry by printing
floor plans directly onto concrete slabs, offering unparalleled
precision and efficiency. Traditional methods of laying out floor
plans are labor-intensive and error-prone. New robots use Building
Information Modeling data to autonomously print accurate floor plans,
eliminating the need for manual measurements and chalk lines. A video
showing one of the robots in action is available in the article.

 THE UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVENESS OF MODERN SORT ALGORITHMS (16 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 It's possible to beat the best sort implementations with
domain-specific knowledge, careful benchmarking, and an understanding
of CPU micro-architectures. However, assumptions will become invalid
and mistakes may creep in silently. Good sort implementations can be
surprisingly fast even without prior domain knowledge. Developers
should think twice about replacing high-quality sort implementations
with something home-grown. 

 JUST ENOUGH AUTOMATION (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Automation is a tool, not a goal. We should never automate something
for the sake of it. Automation is great for self-documenting, and it
can help fight human error, but it should be wielded with purpose. It
shouldn't be the default regardless of its effectiveness at being fit
for any particular purpose.

 TIKTOK SAYS ITS SEARCH ENGINE USAGE RIVALS GOOGLE AMONG GEN Z (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 TikTok is primed to disrupt Google. New research shows that there is
a closing gap between Google and TikTok's search engines, especially
among Gen Z. Many people are turning to TikTok while searching for
specific categories like fashion and beauty advice, cooking,
entertainment, and DIY. If Google continues down its current path, we
could be headed into a fragmented search world where ChatGPT handles
complex queries, TikTok serves users who want audio-visual results,
and Google plays the middle while hanging on to its market share. 

 ORACLE IS THE NEW NVIDIA, FOR BETTER OR WORSE (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Oracle recently revealed in its fiscal first-quarter report that
remaining performance obligations more than tripled from three months
ago to $455 billion. The company has even more multibillion-dollar
deals in the pipeline that could take that number past half a
trillion. The sharp rise in revenue was fueled by demand for
artificial-intelligence computing. Oracle now expects its cloud
infrastructure revenue to hit $114 billion in the 2029 fiscal year.
