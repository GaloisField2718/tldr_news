 THE AI VOICE TOOL THAT HELPS YOU MOVE FASTER EVERYWHERE (SPONSOR) [4]


 For 150 years, we've been stuck typing. Wispr Flow [4] ends that era.

It turns your voice into clean, perfectly formatted writing the moment
you stop speaking — in Slack, Notion, Gmail, ChatGPT, or anywhere
you already work.

Flow learns your phrasing [4], edits as you speak, and helps you move
4× faster across every app — from enhancing GPT prompts to
capturing ideas or writing docs in seconds.

It's how builders, founders, and vibe coders stay in flow all day.

Less typing. More creating.

 OPENAI LOOKS FOR ITS “GOOGLE CHROME” MOMENT WITH NEW ATLAS WEB
BROWSER (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's Atlas browser is now available for macOS. The browser has
all the features users expect from a browser and also lets users chat
with an assistant about web pages, browsing history, and bookmarks.
Windows and mobile versions will be rolled out soon. Atlas has an
Agent Mode that can complete tasks for users, but it is only available
to ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers while still in 'preview mode'. 

 AMAZON PLANS TO REPLACE MORE THAN HALF A MILLION JOBS WITH ROBOTS (12
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Amazon plans to replace more than half a million jobs with robots by
2033. The company's automation team estimates that Amazon can avoid
hiring more than 160,000 people in the US it would otherwise need by
2027, saving the company 30 cents on each item that it delivers to
customers. Amazon is so sure of this automated future that it has
started developing plans to mitigate the fallout in communities that
may lose jobs. The company's plans could have a profound impact on
blue-collar jobs and serve as a model for other companies.

 SPACEX OPENS UP ITS STARLINK LASER TECH TO THIRD-PARTY COMPANIES (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Muon Space is integrating Starlink's laser technology into its own
satellites to provide them with an optical fiber-like connection to
the Starlink constellation. SpaceX's mini laser terminals can support
a 25Gbps connection between two satellites at a range of up to 4,000
kilometers. Muon Space plans to launch the first Starlink-enabled Halo
satellite in Q1 2027. The company supplies weather and
climate-monitoring satellite systems to third-party clients, including
the US Space Force. Starlink's laser technology will transform Muon
Halo satellites from isolated vehicles to real-time nodes on
Starlink's global network. 

 THE ROBOTS FUELING AMAZON'S AUTOMATION (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Amazon got started with robots in 2012 when it bought the robot maker
Kiva, which made circular robots that could lift a stack of goods and
take it to a worker. Since then, the company has categorized all of
its operations into six types of automation: movement, manipulation,
sorting, storage, identification, and packing. Amazon has developed
robots that tackle particular changes like moving heavy carts, sorting
packed orders, and manipulating items and packages. Employees only
touch products at a few stages at Amazon's most advanced warehouse.
This article takes a look at the state of Amazon's automation
activities and what the future holds for the company and its
technology.

 ARE YOU USING AI TO YOUR ADVANTAGE? FIND OUT HOW TO MAKE EVERY AI
INVESTMENT COUNT. (SPONSOR) [9]

more with this _AI Use Case Discovery Guide_ [9]. 

 BUILD YOUR OWN DATABASE (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post walks readers through how to build a key-value database
from the ground up. Key-value databases work similarly to objects in
JavaScript - you store values using a key and retrieve them later
using that same key. The post covers everything required to build a
Log-Structured Merge (LSM) Tree, a type of database used in the real
world that works by combining an in-memory list with an on-disk file.
LSM trees have proven to perform really well at scale - on Prime Day
2020, DynamoDB peaked at 80 million requests per second. 

 NEXT.JS 16 (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Next.js features improvements to Turbopack, caching, and the Next.js
architecture. Cache Components are a new set of features designed to
make caching in Next.js more explicit and flexible. The Next.js
DevTools MCP provides agents with Next.js knowledge, unified logs,
automatic error access, and page awareness. More details about what's
new in Next.js are available in the article.

 SAMSUNG GALAXY XR HANDS-ON: IT'S LIKE A CHEAPER APPLE VISION PRO AND
LAUNCHES TODAY (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Samsung's Galaxy XR brings an experience comparable to Apple Vision
Pro, but with a $1,799 price tag, giving users much more bang for
their buck. The headset launches in the US and Korea today. It is
significantly lighter than the Vision Pro, and it also comes with a
native Netflix app. Samsung and Google are offering an 'explorer pack'
with each headset that includes a free year of Google AI Pro, Google
Play Pass, and YouTube Premium, YouTube TV for $1 a month for three
months, and a free season of NBA League Pass. 

 AI IS MAKING US WORK MORE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The AI boom has revived a 996 culture (working from 9 AM to 9 PM, six
days a week). The increase in work may be due to hyper-capable tools
creating a new kind of pressure to keep working. The challenge of the
AI era is learning to live with these tools in a healthy way that
doesn't allow them to enslave us, and knowing when and how to use them
in a way that doesn't diminish our efforts. AI doesn't demand work -
people and systems do.
