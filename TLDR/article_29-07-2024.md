 APPLE INTELLIGENCE DELAYED TO IOS 18.1 IN OCTOBER (1 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Apple Intelligence is being delayed to give Apple more time to fix
bugs. The company now plans to start rolling out the feature several
weeks after the launch of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. There
is concern about the stability of the feature and developers need more
testing time. Apple Intelligence will still be made available to
software developers as soon as next week with the first betas of iOS
18.1 and iPadOS 18.1.

alternative technologies to the cookie.

 SEVENTH PATIENT ‘CURED' OF HIV: WHY SCIENTISTS ARE EXCITED (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A 60-year-old man in Germany is the seventh person with HIV to be
announced free of the virus after receiving a stem-cell transplant.
The patient received stem cells which only had one copy of a gene that
has been suggested as the best target for an HIV cure. The findings
widen the donor pool for stem-cell transplants - roughly 1% of people
of European descent carry mutations in both copies of the gene, while
10% of people carry one mutated copy. The procedure, which is risky
and offered to people with leukemia, is unlikely to be rolled out for
most individuals with HIV. 

 SOLID-STATE BATTERIES ARE FINALLY MAKING THEIR WAY OUT OF THE LAB (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article takes a look at the history of batteries, the latest
breakthroughs, and the trends that suggest that solid-state batteries
could soon overtake lithium-ion ones. Battery design hasn't changed
much since the first battery in 1799 - solid-state batteries have been
the major exception. Their development has been held back by cost,
manufacturing challenges, and a tendency for them to short-circuit.
Solid-state batteries seem to finally be ready to deliver on their
promise, with several companies getting ready to or already releasing
products containing the technology.

reading from files or standard output. It is configurable through a
JSON file and command-line arguments.

 Patchwork automates development gruntwork like PR reviews, bug
fixing, and security patching using a self-hosted CLI agent and large
language models. It features customizable prompts optimized for chores
like library updates, code generation, issue analysis, and
vulnerability remediation. Patchflows can be run locally in a CLI or
IDE or as part of a CI/CD pipeline. A short demo video is available.

 THE NEW INTERNET (16 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article discusses the big vision for Tailscale. The tech
industry has evolved into a mess, making things harder for developers.
While almost all devices are now supercomputers compared to the
standards of 20 years ago, they become useless once you turn off AWS.
This centralization is caused by a lack of connectivity. Tailscale
aims to increase connectivity by creating a new Internet that works
how you thought the Internet worked, before you learned how the
Internet works. Its network slices out layers of nonsense so that
every device can connect securely and safely and be a peer without
adding latency or overhead.
