 TESLA STARTS RELEASING TO EMPLOYEES FSD V12 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla has started releasing its Full Self-Driving v12 update to
employees. The biggest difference with the update is how vehicle
controls will be taken over by neural nets rather than being hardcoded
by engineers. Tesla may be able to push the update to customers by the
end of the year. Elon Musk has previously said that he believes that
Tesla will achieve true self-driving capability by the end of the
year. 

 GOOGLE WILL START DELETING OLD ACCOUNTS THIS WEEK. HERE'S HOW TO SAVE
YOUR GOOGLE ACCOUNT (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google will start deleting inactive Google accounts from December 1.
Accounts are deemed inactive if the user hasn't logged on for at least
two years. Gmail addresses for deleted accounts cannot be used again
when creating a new Google account. Users just need to sign into their
accounts to preserve them.

 SPACEX LAUNCH EXPECTED IN DECEMBER FOLLOWING 2 EXPLOSIVE STARSHIP
TESTS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SpaceX plans to test Starship for the third time in December. There
are now three ships in final production. SpaceX launched the second
Starship test on November 18. The ship successfully performed a
hot-stage separation, but it exploded after it completed a flap and
boostback burn. 

 ‚ÄòTREASURE TROVE‚Äô OF NEW CRISPR SYSTEMS HOLDS PROMISE FOR GENOME
EDITING (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers used an algorithm to sort through millions of genomes to
find new rare types of CRISPR systems that could eventually be adopted
into genome-editing tools. Single-celled bacteria and archaea use
CRISPR systems to defend themselves against bacteriophages. The
algorithm helped scientists identify the code for an entirely unknown
CRISPR system that targets RNA. Researchers will be able to use the
algorithm to look for other types of protein across species.

 NEED A PRNG? USE A CSPRNG (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Developers should always use a Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom
Number Generator (CSPRNG) when choosing a Pseudorandom Number
Generator. While people typically say to only use CSPRNGs when doing
cryptography and need security against adversarial attackers, they are
really the only thing that makes sense to use. This article talks
about why developers should only use CSPRNGs by comparing them with
other random number generation methods. CSPRNGs are better by
definition as given the first n bits, there is no efficient algorithm
that will predict the next bit with a success rate non-negligibly
better than 50%. 

 RAGS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 RAGs is a Streamlit app that lets users create RAG pipelines from
data sources using natural language. Users just have to describe the
tasks and parameters they want from their RAG systems. The RAG can be
queried and it will answer questions over the data.

 THE FAILED COMMODIFICATION OF TECHNICAL WORK (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 It's difficult to commodify technical work. Despite the crazy
infrastructure that allows us to mass produce things, in many cases,
individual people make the machine run. Society runs on
commodification, but anyone who thinks that it can run on pure
commodification, without any understanding of the human complexities
of the people around them, is wrong. 

 THE BOND VILLAIN COMPLIANCE STRATEGY (15 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Binance and its CEO recently pleaded guilty to operating the world's
largest criminal conspiracy to launder money and paid more than $4
billion in fines. This article looks at the history of Binance to see
what led to this outcome. The ruling settles a long-running
investigation involving the DOJ, CFTC, FinCEN, and assorted other
parts of the US regulatory state. However, it importantly doesn't
resolve the SEC's parallel action, which includes charges of operating
an unregistered exchange, misrepresenting trading controls, and the
unregistered offer and sale of securities.

 IT'S TIME TO CHOP WOOD WITH A BLUNT AXE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The traditional strategy of mastering a single tool may no longer be

discard old ones and focus on things that are stable around the
rapidly shifting software foundation.
