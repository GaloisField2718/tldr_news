 CALIFORNIA GIVES WAYMO THE GREEN LIGHT TO EXPAND ROBOTAXI OPERATIONS
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Waymo has been given permission to operate its self-driving robotaxis
on highways in parts of Los Angeles and the Bay Area. Its cars will be
allowed to drive at up to 65 mph on local roads and highways in
approved areas. Waymo has no immediate plans to extend service to
highways. The company's expansion has been put on hold until June
following protests from several San Francisco city agencies and other
groups. 

 ELON MUSK SUES OPENAI AND CEO SAM ALTMAN OVER CONTRACT BREACH (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk is suing OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, among others,
claiming that they abandoned the company's founding mission to develop
artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity. Musk, one of the
co-founders of OpenAI, stepped down from the firm's board in 2018. The
lawsuit alleges that OpenAI's focus on maximizing profits for
Microsoft breaks its agreement to ensure that AGI benefits all of
humanity. Its aim is to compel OpenAI to adhere to the Founding
Agreement and return to its mission to develop AGI for the benefit of
humanity.

 HOW SCIENTISTS ARE USING SOUND WAVES TO HACK THE BRAIN (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Researchers in South Korea have found a way to influence the
formation of connections between neurons using ultrasound stimulation.
Ultrasound waves can penetrate deep into the brain with surprising
precision. The technique mimics brain waves common during learning and
memory processes. It could lead to new medical treatments and make
learning easier for everyone. 

 A FEW SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS ARE SHAPING AI (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An analysis of more than 8,000 AI and ML papers found that papers
shared by two specific influencers had a median citation count two to
three times higher than those from a control group. Academic citations
affect decisions like research funding and tenure at academic
institutions. The correlation between influencer tweets and citation
count points to a shift in how the community finds and reads papers.
The overwhelming volume of papers published daily makes it impractical
for individuals to sift through feeds, so the community is relying on
curators to highlight noteworthy papers.

 WHAT WE LEARNED IN 6 MONTHS OF WORKING ON A CODEGEN DEV TOOL GPT
PILOT (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 GPT Pilot is an AI developer that creates plans for how apps and
features should be built before coding. It can do most of its work
autonomously, asking for clarification or help when required. The
project aimed to create a framework of thinking that gets AI to
continuously work by revising its previous actions using a feedback
loop that determines what it should do next in order to finish the end
goal. This article contains lessons learned by its creators during
development.

 AI STARTUPS REQUIRE NEW STRATEGIES: THIS TIME IT‚ÄôS ACTUALLY
DIFFERENT (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The typical dynamics between startups and incumbents that applied in
previous technology revolutions like mobile and the Internet do not
apply in AI. Incumbents are spending historic amounts of money and
time embracing AI technology - they have the data, talent, and
funding. There isn't really an 'AI market' - the market for chatbots
and SEO tools is the same as before, just with more competition. AI
startups that don't embrace this reality will likely fail.

Air models along with new Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories

iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone cases, and Apple Watch bands. The
products will be announced on Apple's website and through a series of
videos and marketing campaigns.
