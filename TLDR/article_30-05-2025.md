 TESLA TARGETS JUNE 12 LAUNCH OF ROBOTAXI SERVICE IN AUSTIN (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Tesla plans to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin on
June 12. The date has only been discussed internally and could still
change. The company this week operated a test vehicle on public roads
in Austin with no one in the driver's seat for the first time. Elon
Musk said earlier this month that Tesla would officially roll out a
fleet of about 10 self-driving robotaxis in Austin before expanding to

 CHINA TO VISIT EARTH'S ‘QUASI-MOON' AND BRING A CHUNK OF IT BACK
HOME (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 China's National Space Agency has launched an asteroid sample mission
aimed at Asteroid 2016HO3, aka 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, which orbits the
Sun. The Tianwen 2 probe rode a Long March 3B rocket into orbit at
1:31 Thursday morning. 2016HO3 is estimated to have a diameter of 40
to 100 meters. It is an attractive target for exploration because it
can be reached by a spacecraft traveling at a modest 7 kilometers per
second. The probe will reach the asteroid in about a year and then
orbit it for a while before landing and attempting to retrieve around
100 grams of material.
