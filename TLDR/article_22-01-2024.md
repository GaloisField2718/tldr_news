 NOW OPENAI CEO SAM ALTMAN WANTS BILLIONS FOR AI CHIP FABS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman is reportedly seeking billions in capital to
build out a network of AI chip fabs. The project would fund the
construction and operation of chip factories around the world to
support the growing demand for neural network accelerators. It aims to
build enough assembly lines to ensure there is enough supply of AI
processors to meet demand. Altman has previously expressed concerns
that there aren't enough processors to go around.

(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Samsung ended its Unpacked event with a tease of its Galaxy Ring.
There were few details given onstage besides a flashy reel of a
sparkly ring with a few visible sensors on the inside of the band. A
Samsung spokesperson said that the ring was designed to empower people
to manage their health by providing consistent and accurate tracking
data. The rings will reportedly come in three finishes and in sizes up
to 13 and will be available later this year.

 ALPHAFOLD FOUND THOUSANDS OF POSSIBLE PSYCHEDELICS. WILL ITS
PREDICTIONS HELP DRUG DISCOVERY? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have used AlphaFold, a protein-structure-prediction tool,
to identify hundreds of thousands of potential new psychedelics. The
predictions show that AlphaFold can be used for fast drug discovery, a
process that can take years using conventional methods. While some
scientists are skeptical of the potential of the technology to change
the field of drug discovery, there is evidence that the tool has
strong potential to help scientists find new drugs. Isomorphic Labs,
DeepMind's drug-discovery spin-off, recently announced deals worth up
to $2.9 billion to hunt for drugs using machine-learning tools such as
AlphaFold. 

 NASA REVEALS INCREDIBLE X-59: A UNIQUE, EXPERIMENTAL SUPERSONIC JET
(2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 NASA's X-59 is a supersonic aircraft designed to minimize the sonic
boom it creates when it crosses the speed of sound. It can fly at 1.4
times the speed of sound. The project, a joint effort with Lockheed
Martin, aims to revolutionize air travel by producing a new generation
of commercial jets that can travel faster than the speed of sound. A
picture of the research aircraft is available in the article.

 THE VISION PRO‚ÄôS FIRST KILLER APP IS THE WEB, WHETHER APPLE LIKES
IT OR NOT (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 It's increasingly clear that the early success of the Vision Pro will
depend on Safari. The open web is Apple's best chance at making its
headset a winner - developers aren't exactly jumping to build new apps
for Apple's new platform so far. This could be a big win for the
future of the internet as developers will spend more time on web apps.
Apple recently added more features to Safari and there are
platform-specific features for Safari on visionOS. Apple may have to
let go of some of its App Store control to help the Vision Pro get off
to a good start.
