 THIS TECH COMPANY GREW 32,481%... (SPONSOR) [4] 

 No, it's not Nvidia… It's MODE MOBILE, 2023's fastest-growing
software company according to Deloitte.

Just as Uber turned vehicles into income-generating assets, Mode is
TURNING SMARTPHONES INTO THE EASIEST PASSIVE INCOME SOURCE [4],
already helping 45M+ users earn $325M+ through simple, everyday use. 

The technology behind it all is the _EarnPhone_, and it could be the
biggest disruption to smartphones since the iPhone.

Mode has recently secured their Nasdaq stock ticker $MODE, but you can
still invest in their pre-IPO offering at just $0.26/share [4].
They've received over $35M in investments, and their share price is
changing in under two weeks.

 OPENAI RELEASES NEW SIMULATED REASONING MODELS WITH FULL TOOL ACCESS
(7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has released two new models, o3 and o4-mini. These models
combine simulated reasoning capabilities with access to functions like
web browsing and coding. It is the first time OpenAI's
reasoning-focused models can use every ChatGPT tool simultaneously.
ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users now have access to the models -
Enterprise and Edu customers will gain access next week. OpenAI plans
to release o3-pro to the Pro tier in a few weeks. 

 ELON MUSK SHUT DOWN INTERNAL TESLA ANALYSIS THAT SHOWED ROBOTAXI
WOULD LOSE MONEY (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 An internal analysis from Tesla executives showed that the company's
Robotaxi plans would lose money. The analysis also said that the
company should focus on a new affordable electric vehicle called the
'Model 2', but Elon Musk canceled plans for the vehicle and pushed
only for the Cybercab, replacing plans for the next-gen affordable EV
with cheaper versions of the Model Y and Model 3. The decision is
likely the reason Tesla is in a slump right now.

 LAB-GROWN CHICKEN ‘NUGGETS' HAILED AS ‘TRANSFORMATIVE STEP' FOR
CULTURED MEAT (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scientists have grown nugget-sized chunks of chicken in a device that
mimics the blood vessels that make up the circulatory system. The
approach uses fine hollow fibers to deliver oxygen and nutrients to
cells suspended in a gel. It paves the way for whole cuts of chicken,
beef, pork, and fish to be grown in the lab. The same technology has
the potential to produce functional organs. 

 FUTURE CHIPS WILL BE HOTTER THAN EVER (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Engineers have managed to double the number of transistors they can
pack into the same area every two years, but the unwanted side effect
of heat is becoming more and more prominent. Temperature affects
performance, power consumption, and energy efficiency. Excessive heat
can slow the propagation of critical signals in a processor, lead to a
permanent degradation of chip performance over time, and cause
transistors to leak more current, wasting power. As the density of
logic circuits continues to grow, so does power density, generating
heat as a by-product. Efficient heat dissipation will be crucial to
maintaining chip performance and longevity as chips become
increasingly compact and powerful.

 OPENAI CODEX CLI (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Codex is a lightweight coding agent for the terminal. It was built
for developers who live in the terminal and want ChatGPT-level
reasoning plus the power to run code, manipulate files, and iterate,
all under version control. Codex requires zero setup, runs
network-disabled and directory-sandboxed, and is multimodal. It
supports any model available with the Responses API. 

 12 FACTOR AGENTS - PRINCIPLES FOR BUILDING RELIABLE LLM APPLICATIONS
(GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Even if large language models (LLMs) continue to get more powerful,
there will still be core engineering techniques that will make
LLM-powered software more reliable, scalable, and easier to maintain.
This article discusses 12 principles for building LLM-powered software
that is actually good enough to put in the hands of production
customers. The fastest way for builders to create high-quality AI
software is to take small, modular concepts from agent building and
incorporate them into existing products. These concepts can be defined
and applied by most skilled software engineers even if they don't have
an AI background.

 THE BUSINESS OF THE AI LABS (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 While large language model providers have spearheaded a new AI
revolution, the jury is still out on whether they are good businesses.
Investors are still wondering whether these pioneering labs will reap
profits or whether other parts of the AI ecosystem will capture the
lion's share of value. This article looks at the industry and suggests
strategies that labs could pursue to secure good economics for
themselves. While there are certainly challenges to the AI lab
business model, there are still many strategic options open to them. 

 INSIDE MARK ZUCKERBERG'S FAILED NEGOTIATIONS TO END ANTITRUST CASE (5
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The FTC had wanted $30 billion to drop its antitrust case against
Meta, but Mark Zuckerberg decided to offer $450 million instead.
Zuckerberg was confident that President Trump would back him up with
the FTC as he had been developing closer ties to Trump. The FTC said
the offer was not credible and that it wasn't ready to settle for
anything less than $18 billion and a consent decree. Meta upped its
offer to close to $1 billion as the trial approached, but it wasn't
enough.
