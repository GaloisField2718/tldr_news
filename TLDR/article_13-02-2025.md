READ) [7] 

 Google DeepMind has published a video demonstration of miniature
humanoid robots playing a one-on-one game of soccer. The robots are
able to understand the rules of the game and can anticipate where the
ball is going or when to block shots from an opponent. The 15-second

 SEAFLOOR DETECTOR PICKS UP RECORD NEUTRINO WHILE UNDER CONSTRUCTION
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A team building a detector on the Mediterranean Sea got extremely
lucky recently when it picked up the most energetic neutrino ever
detected. The detector was only 10% of the size it will be on
completion. The neutrino originated outside of our galaxy. Once
completed, the detector will be able to help scientists detect where
sources of neutrinos reside.

 THE MISSING TIER FOR QUERY COMPILERS (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 These days, a cheap NVME SSD can supply data much faster than a query
interpreter can process it. Depending on the query, removing the
interpreter bottleneck can yield several orders of magnitude speedup.
The article looks at different options for compiling queries and their
pros and cons. Queries might only be run once, so it's only worth
spending time on optimization at compile-time if doing so will save
even more time at runtime. 

 UNDERSTANDING THE TRADE-OFFS OF USING TAILWIND CSS (12 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This article explores the benefits and trade-offs of building web
pages with Tailwind. Tailwind is a CSS framework that uses a
utility-first approach that involves styling elements directly without
needing to leave HTML. It promises developers the ability to build
modern web pages quickly and simply, but there can be significant
impacts on maintenance and scaling. Tailwind's utility-first approach
can work well for small-to-medium projects where speed and
cost-efficiency are top priorities, but for larger projects or teams
with established CSS practices, it introduces challenges around
readability, maintainability, and scalability.

 THE ECONOMICS OF BEING A FOUNDING ENGINEER (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Working at a large technology company has been an excellent financial
decision for technically capable people over the last few years.
Joining a rocketship startup - at the right time - can also be an
excellent decision. Early-career cash pay at YC startups is often
similar to big tech firms. Founding engineers can receive equity that,
vested over four years, could potentially be not too different from an
offer from Facebook. The median startup fails, making the equity
worthless, but there is the potential for extraordinary returns. Being
a founding engineer essentially means taking a pay cut and accepting
illiquid equity in exchange for a lottery ticket - it's a high-stakes
game of calculated risk-taking where due diligence can help tilt the
odds in your favor. 

 AN UPDATE ON HIGHLY ANTICIPATED—AND ELUSIVE—MICRO LED DISPLAYS
(12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Micro LED, one of the most anticipated display technologies, is still
years away from being suitable for the mass production of consumer
products. The industry is struggling to manage obstacles Luke
manufacturing costs and competition from other advanced display
technologies. It will probably still be another five years before
consumer products are available.
