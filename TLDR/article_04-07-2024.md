 NOPLACE, A MASHUP OF TWITTER AND MYSPACE FOR GEN Z, HITS NO. 1 ON THE
APP STORE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 noplace, an app that aims to bring the 'social' back to 'social
media', has surged to the top of the iOS App Store. Launched out of
invite-only mode on Wednesday, the app allows users to have colorful
customizable profiles and share everything from relationship status to
what they're listening or watching, what they're reading or doing, and
more. It focuses on text-based updates and currently doesn't support
photos or videos. The app offers a feed with friends and another
global feed from everyone in the app - both are in reverse
chronological order. It uses AI technology to drive suggestions and
creation and create summaries for things users may have missed. 

 THREADS HITS 175 MILLION USERS AFTER A YEAR (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Threads has reached more than 175 million monthly active users.
Launched on the App Store last year on July 5, the app is still
growing steadily. Meta hasn't shared daily user numbers, suggesting
that Threads is getting a lot of traffic from people who have yet to
become regular users. Much of the app's growth is still coming from it
being promoted inside Instagram. Meta is considering turning on ads in
Threads sometime next year.

 SPACEX WILL ATTEMPT THE FIRST COMMERCIAL SPACEWALK (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Polaris Dawn, a mission designed to purchase the limits of SpaceX's
technology and help pave the way for a longer-term human presence in
space, is now set to launch no earlier than July 12. It will be
SpaceX's second all-civilian mission and the first in its Polaris
program. The mission plans include the first commercial spacewalk,
research on human health in space, and tests to equip the spacecraft
with Starlink Wi-Fi. It will reach an orbit of over 800 miles above
Earth, the furthest out a human has gone from the planet since the
Apollo era. 

 ‚ÄòSKINNY JABS': WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS SET FOR NEW BOOM AS GENERIC
VERSIONS EMERGE (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Generic versions of Wegovy, Saxenda, Ozempic, and Victoza are set to
hit the market soon at a lower cost than the original drugs. Patents
for liraglutide, which is in Victoza and Saxenda, have expired. Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries, the world's largest generic drugmaker, has
already launched a generic version of Victoza in the US. Pfizer,
Viatris' Mylan, and Novartis' Sandoz are also planning to launch their
own generic liraglutide products. Ozempic and Wegovy will lose patent
protection in China in 2026, in Europe and Japan in 2031, and in the
US in 2032.

 CLOUDFLARE DEBUTS ONE-CLICK NUKE OF WEB-SCRAPING AI (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Cloudflare is now offering its web hosting customers a way to block
AI bots from scraping website content and using the data without
permission to train machine learning models. It is able to recognize
bot activity even when operators lie about their user agent. The bot
detection approach relies on digital fingerprinting. With a network
that sees an average of 57 million requests per second, Cloudflare has
ample data to determine which fingerprints can be trusted. 

 ASK HN: HAS ANYONE SUCCESSFULLY PIVOTED FROM WEB DEV TO AI/ML
DEVELOPMENT? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [10] 

 Before getting into AI development, first decide whether you want to
train models from scratch or build cool things on top of AI models.
Knowing how to train models may not be that useful when working with
generative AI - it's better to develop knowledge in other areas like
prompting, evals, and using models to build production-quality apps.
Calling an API is going to work better than dedicating a team to tune
a private model before scaling in most cases. It is possible to obtain
an AI research position without a PhD, but it will take years of
study.

 AI'S $600B QUESTION (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI will likely create a huge amount of economic value. Speculative
frenzies are part of the technology and not something to be afraid of.
Those who remain level-headed have the chance to build extremely
important companies. However, not everyone is going to get rich soon
because AGI is coming. There is still a long road ahead with lots of
ups and downs before that happens. 

 THE UNDERGROUND NETWORK SNEAKING NVIDIA CHIPS INTO CHINA (10 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 There is a barely concealed network of buyers, sellers, and couriers
bypassing the restrictions aimed at denying China's access to Nvidia's
advanced AI chips. The flow of hardware is so steady that most of the
sellers take preorders and promise delivery in weeks. Some even sell
entire servers. Research institutions have been among the main buyers
of the advanced AI chips. The market will likely remain robust and
adaptive until viable domestically-made chips emerge in China.
