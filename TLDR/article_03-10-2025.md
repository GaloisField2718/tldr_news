 BLUE ORIGIN AIMS TO LAND NEXT NEW GLENN BOOSTER, THEN REUSE IT FOR
MOON MISSION (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The second launch of Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket will send two
NASA-funded satellites toward Mars to study the processes that drove
the planet's evolution from a warmer, wetter world to the cold, dry
planet of today. A successful launch would nudge Blue Origin closer to
winning certification from the Space Force to begin launching national
security satellites. The company plans to recover the New Glenn
rocket's first stage booster during the mission. 

 OPENAI'S SORA SOARS TO NO. 3 ON THE US APP STORE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI's Sora app saw 56,000 downloads on its first day. It is now
ranked third Top Overall app on the US App Store, despite being
invite-only and limited to users in the US and Canada. The ChatGPT app
and Google's Gemini iOS apps had stronger launches, with each reaching
at least 80,000 downloads on day one, but since Sora is invite-only,
that may not be a fair comparison. The strong release indicates there
is a demand for AI video tools with a social networking-like
experience.

 DEMYSTIFYING THE SCIENCE BEHIND FISSION AND FUSION (11 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Kemmerer, Wyoming, will soon be home to the most advanced nuclear
facility in the world. The first-ever Natrium plant, it will bring
safe, next-generation nuclear energy. The plant was designed by
TerraPower, a company Bill Gates started in 2008. This article looks
at the science behind the Natrium plant. TerraPower aims to bring the
plant online in 2030. 

 THE QUEST TO SEQUENCE THE GENOMES OF EVERYTHING (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Earth BioGenome Project (EBP) aims to obtain a genome sequence
for every named species of eukaryotic organism on the planet by 2035.
Its success will depend on researchers' ability to scale several
biotech technologies. Specialists on the front lines of the genomic
revolution in biology are confident that such scaling will be
possible. Having a genome sequence for every eukaryotic creature will
give researchers insights into how evolution proceeded for a myriad of
life forms. It could lead to the discovery and development of many
drugs, enzymes, catalysts, and other chemicals of incalculable value.

 ASKED TO DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL AT WORK? HERE'S WHAT THESE SOFTWARE
ENGINEERS DID (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Nishad Singh had confirmation that something illegal was happening at
FTX, but he stayed, and now he is facing up to 75 years in jail. A
senior engineering member at Pollen is now at the mercy of the UK
police with what could be a potential wire fraud case after being
asked to run a script that double-charged customers (and then doing
so). The Director of Engineering at Frank, a student loan startup,
flat out refused to create a fake set of data to pump up customer
numbers. Their refusal is what makes them the only example on this
list that is totally legally safe. 

 WHERE IT'S AT:// (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 All servers speaking the AT protocol are part of 'the atmosphere', a
web of hyperlinked JSON. Each piece of JSON in the atmosphere has its
own at://URI. This post looks at the exact process of resolving an
at:// URI. The AT protocol is fundamentally an abstraction over HTTP,
DNS, and JSON. It turns the web into a place where content belongs to
its creators, not to the apps that display it, by putting users in an
authority position, separating identity from hosting, and making data
portable.

 IN A SEA OF TECH TALENT, COMPANIES CAN'T FIND THE WORKERS THEY WANT
(7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Many tech companies are saying that good help is hard to find. While
there is an ample supply of eager and capable engineers for hire,
employers say there aren't enough people with the most in-demand
skills. Companies are looking for AI-specific experience, but
relatively few people have it because the technology is so new.
Companies should focus on identifying candidates with transferable
skills and let those people learn on the job. 

 META TIGHTENS GRIP ON AI RESEARCH, SPARKING INTERNAL ANGER AND FEARS
FOR OPEN CULTURE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Meta has added a new review process for academic papers, sparking
internal anger. Yann LeCun, a Turing Award winner and a pivotal figure
in modern AI, reportedly considered resigning over the change. The new
policy is aimed at aligning pure research more closely with Meta's
product road map. It will also help mitigate potential reputational
risks from controversial findings. The constant state of
reorganization raises critical questions about whether Meta is able to
turn its recently acquired assets into a dominant force.
