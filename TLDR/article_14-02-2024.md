 OPENAI EXPERIMENTS WITH GIVING CHATGPT A LONG-TERM CONVERSATION
MEMORY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is experimenting with adding a form of long-term memory to
ChatGPT. Users will be able to ask the chatbot to remember something,
see what it remembers, and ask it to forget. The feature is currently
available to a small number of users for testing. OpenAI hasn't
revealed what technique it is using for the system, but the
implementation is similar to that of Custom Instructions, a feature
that was introduced in July last year. 

 META‚ÄôS CEO FINALLY TRIED APPLE‚ÄôS NEW HEADSET AND HE HAS THOUGHTS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mark Zuckerberg recently posted a video to his Instagram account
giving his official verdict on the Apple Vision Pro versus the Meta
Quest 3. He says that the Quest 3 is the better product. The Quest 3
weighs less and its lack of a wired battery and wider field of view
allows for greater motion. While Zuckerberg thinks the Vision Pro is a
better entertainment device, he notes that the Quest has a better
immersive content library than Apple. The video is available in the
article.

 EARLY DEMENTIA DIAGNOSIS: BLOOD PROTEINS REVEAL AT-RISK PEOPLE (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A study has identified blood proteins that appear to predict the risk
of developing dementia up to 15 years before diagnosis. High levels of
the blood proteins GFAP, NEFL, GDF15, and LTBP2 are strongly
associated with dementia. Blood levels of these proteins can be
outside of normal ranges more than 10 years before symptom onset. The
findings, once validated, may lead to the development of blood tests
that identify people at risk of developing dementia. 

 SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIM THE SUN, AND IT WILL BE SOON (12 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Solar Radiation Management (SRM) is starting to gain more attention
due to 2023's high temperatures. It's much easier to artificially dim
the sun than most people imagine. Injecting sulfur into the
stratosphere could be a cheap way to cool down the Earth. It would
have an almost instant effect, but once it starts it would be
dangerous to suddenly stop. SRM will not fix the root cause of the
problem, but it could buy time for us to remove CO2 from the
atmosphere. However, its implementation could make us more complacent
about fixing the core issues.

 GITBUTLER (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 GitButler is a git branch management tool built for modern workflows.
It is currently available for macOS and Linux - Windows support is in
development. GitButler lets developers work on multiple branches at
the same time, allowing them to quickly organize file changes into
separate branches while still having them apply to the working
directory. It can push branches individually and directly create pull
requests. 

 IS SOMETHING BUGGING YOU? (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Antithesis is now coming out of stealth after five years of
development. One of the fundamental problems of software development
is that software has to handle many situations that the developers
have never thought of or will never anticipate. To overcome this,
Antithesis built a fully-deterministic platform that hunts for bugs in
software. The platform is designed to one day be able to find many
kinds of bugs in many kinds of software, but it currently focuses on
distributed systems reliability/fault tolerance testing. Antithesis is
now looking for organizations running distributed systems for testing.

 ASK HN: HOW DO YOU COME UP WITH SIDE PROJECT IDEAS IN 2024? (HACKER
NEWS THREAD) [11] 

 Many developers agree that most of their best side projects are
personal tools. Some of these tools end up being useful to others, so
they end up being productized and make money. It's much easier to
think about building for yourself compared to thinking about building
for the masses. There are still plenty of new things that can be
built. 

 META‚ÄôS AI CHIEF YANN LECUN ON AGI, OPEN-SOURCE, AND AI RISK (11
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist, received a TIME100 Impact
Award for his contributions to the world of artificial intelligence on
Sunday. LeCun sat down with TIME before the ceremony to discuss
barriers to achieving artificial general intelligence, the merits of
Meta's open-source approach, and claims that AI could pose an
existential risk to the human race. This article contains an edited
transcript of the interview.
