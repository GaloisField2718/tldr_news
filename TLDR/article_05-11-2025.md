 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native solution provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA
cycle to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks [6]—not years
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs [7]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of engineers [8] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

 APPLE PREPARES TO ENTER LOW-COST LAPTOP MARKET FOR FIRST TIME (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Apple is developing an entry-level budget Mac designed for students,
businesses, and casual users. The low-cost laptop is currently in
active testing at Apple and in early production with overseas
suppliers. It will be priced well under $1,000. Apple plans to launch
it in the first half of next year. The move is a strategic shift for
Apple, which has previously vowed not to chase market share with
lower-end offerings. 

 TESLA IS OBSESSED WITH MUSK'S PAY PACKAGE. MUSK IS OBSESSED WITH AI
(14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Elon Musk spent most of his time at xAI after he left DOGE in May,
even holding meetings for Tesla employees at xAI's offices. Musk has
balanced his responsibilities between several fast-growing companies
for years, but the potential of AI has led him to spend much more of
his time at xAI. Tesla will soon announce preliminary results on a
giant pay package designed to ensure that Musk focuses on Tesla for
years to come. The package would increase his stake in Tesla over a
decade from 15% to around 25% if he hits ambitious goals.

 MEET PROJECT SUNCATCHER, GOOGLE'S PLAN TO PUT AI DATA CENTERS IN
SPACE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The cost of electricity on Earth is a problem for large data centers.
Google plans to put data centers in space in a dawn-dusk
sun-synchronous low-earth orbit to ensure they get almost constant
sunlight exposure. It will require solar panels that are up to eight
times more efficient to get the job done. The project will only be
successful if Google's TPUs can run for at least five years. Google
plans to launch a pair of prototype satellites by early 2027. 

 AMAZON EQUIPS NEXT UNDERWATER CABLE WITH 'ROBUST ARMORING' TO PREVENT
CUTS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Amazon is currently laying a new subsea cable across the ocean floor
that will connect the US and Europe. It should be up and running in
2028. Dubbed Fastnet, the state-of-the-art fiber-optic cable system
will be able to transport over 320 terabits per second. Amazon is
investing heavily in the burial process to prevent Fastnet from being
cut or damaged.

 PG_LAKE (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 pg_lake integrates Iceberg and data lake files into Postgres,
transforming Postgres into a stand-alone lakehouse system that
supports transactions and fast queries on Iceberg tables. It can
create and modify Iceberg tables directly from PostgreSQL, and
directly work with raw data files in object stores like S3. pg_lake
can be set up using Docker for an easy, ready-to-run test environment.


 HIGH-PERFORMANCE SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING WITH CSS HIGHLIGHTS API (8
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The CSS Custom Highlight API lets developers style arbitrary text
ranges without modifying the DOM structure. Developers just have to
define 'Range' objects that point to a specific character position in
text nodes, group them by style type, and register them with the
browser's highlight registry. The API is supported in all modern
browsers. This post provides an example implementation of syntax
highlighting using the CSS Highlights API.

 WHY AC IS CHEAP, BUT AC REPAIR IS A LUXURY (18 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Huge bursts of productivity concentrated in one industry are great
because they create a huge number of new jobs and new opportunities,
but this has an interesting spillover effect: the more jobs and
opportunities created by the productivity boom, the more wages
increase in other industries. These industries still have to compete
in the same labor market. As the AI supercycle plays out, some goods
and services will become orders of magnitude cheaper, while others
will become more expensive - but we'll consume more of them anyway.
This effect will even be seen within a single job - some work will see
10x throughput at 10x the quality, while other work, which must be
done by humans, will command a wildly high wage. 

 HOW I USE AI (15 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 AI has transformed how some developers work. We are just starting to
see what the technology can achieve. We still haven't fully explored
what current models can do. There are some concerning possibilities
with the future of the technology, but for now, it is still in its
'wondrous' stage.
