PROTOTYPES TESTED (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The iPhone Fold is on schedule for a potential launch in the second
half of next year. It reportedly reached a realistic prototyping stage
sometime last month. If everything stays on track, the prototype could

VALLEY BANK'S 2023 COLLAPSE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Palmer Luckey and a group of tech billionaires have founded a new

 GENE THERAPY RESTORES HEARING IN TODDLERS AND TEENAGERS BORN WITH
CONGENITAL DEAFNESS – NEW RESEARCH (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have developed a form of gene therapy that can
successfully restore hearing in toddlers and young adults born with
OTOF-related deafness, a condition caused by mutations in the OTOF
gene. People with this condition have healthy hearing structures in
their inner ear, but one crucial gene isn't working properly - fixing
the faulty gene restores hearing. The researchers used a virus as a
delivery system to carry a working copy of the OTOF gene directly to
the inner ear's hearing cells, restoring hearing sometimes to
near-normal levels. 

 AI VIRTUAL PERSONALITY YOUTUBERS, OR ‘VTUBERS,' ARE EARNING
MILLIONS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Advances in AI are fueling a new wave of virtual creators on YouTube
like Bloo, a fully virtual personality powered by artificial
intelligence with a massive following of 2.5 million subscribers and
more than 700 million views. Bloo has already generated more than
seven figures in revenue, according to its creator. Everything else on
Bloo's channel is handled by AI technology from ElevenLabs, OpenAI,
Google, and Anthropic. The rise in AI-generated content has led to
growing criticism from users who say it's harder to find meaningful or
original material.

 RUBY ON RAILS: THE OPEN-SOURCE BLUEPRINT (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ruby on Rails has embraced open source principles since its debut in
2004, giving developers freedom, flexibility, and a strong
community-driven direction. Rails thrived because anyone could
contribute, companies invested in it while keeping it free, and its
modular design allowed endless customization. The project proved that
open source software can compete with and often surpass commercial
alternatives. This article looks at why Rails' choice of using the MIT
License was revolutionary, how Rails inspired a generation of
frameworks, and why Rails is so good for open source projects. 

 CONTINUOUS AI IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Continuous AI is the concept of integrating AI tooling automatically
into existing development flows. This doesn't include tooling that
purports to write and test entire changes for developers. Continuous
AI can add a surprising amount of value. This article discusses some
ways in which to integrate AI to perform automated checks,
organizational tasks, and help with other parts of the software
engineering process.

 Several CEOs have publicly stated their views on how AI will replace
workers over the coming years. Automation software, AI, and robots are
being rolled out to make operations as lean as possible. Few roles

reshaped by AI, past technological revolutions have shown that new
jobs often emerge. 

 MICROSOFT TO LAY OFF ABOUT 9,000 WORKERS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Microsoft plans to cut another 9,000 workers, less than 4% of the
tech giant's global workforce, in its latest round of layoffs. The
cuts to staff will span levels, geographies, tenure, and teams.
Companies across many sectors have been reducing their workforces
while looking to boost productivity. The increasing use of artificial
intelligence may eliminate the need for certain roles.
