 CHINESE DEVELOPERS SCRAMBLE AS OPENAI BLOCKS ACCESS IN CHINA (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Chinese attempts to lure domestic developers away from OpenAI will
now be a lot easier as OpenAI has blocked users in China from
accessing its tools and services. The tool was already blocked through
the government's firewall, but developers were previously still able
to use virtual private networks to access OpenAI's tools. OpenAI has
not elaborated on the reason for its sudden decision. The decision may
result in an acceleration of development by Chinese AI companies. 

 TESLA'S SHARE OF U.S. ELECTRIC CAR MARKET FALLS BELOW 50% (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Tesla accounted for just under half of all battery-powered vehicles
sold in the US in the second quarter of this year. The sales of
battery-powered cars have surged to a new record, climbing 11.5
percent from a year earlier, with Tesla losing ground to General
Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai, and Kia. This is the first time Tesla's
market share has fallen below 50 percent in a quarter. There are now
over 100 electric vehicle models available in the US. Intense
competition has led to lower prices, helping push adoption slowly
higher.

 DOCTORS RESTORING BLOODFLOW IN LEGALLY DEAD BODIES TO RETRIEVE DONOR
ORGANS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A highly controversial procedure called normothermic regional
perfusion, which involves pumping blood through a deceased person's
body, can help doctors retrieve donor organs even if patients have
already been declared dead. The procedure greatly increases the
chances of obtaining functional donor organs and could save a lot of
lives. It stops organs from being damaged by keeping up the
circulation of oxygen-rich blood. There are concerns that the
procedure may be able to restore limited brain activity, but there are
ways to stop blood from reaching the brain. 

 ROBOTAXIS SHOULD BE A WAKEUP CALL FOR CITIES (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The biggest hurdles currently facing the robotaxi industry are
economic and regulatory, not technological. Robotaxi companies will
need to be able to compete on price, convenience, and comfort before
their vehicles become a more accepted travel option. If they are
successful, there could be significant traffic and labor impacts.
Robotaxis will likely make roads safer and create demand for new types
of buildings with no parking.

 PYSKYWIFI: COMPLETELY FREE, UNBELIEVABLY STUPID WI-FI ON LONG-HAUL
FLIGHTS (28 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A developer discovered a way to access the internet for free while
clicking through an airline's Wi-Fi payment menu. This article
discusses how they exploited this discovery to develop a tool that
allowed them to access the full internet for free, albeit at a very
slow pace. The exploit involves editing data on the developer's
airmiles account to send and receive HTTP requests and responses. 

 MAELSTROM (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Maelstrom is a suite of tools that can run tests in hermetic
microcontainers locally or distributed across arbitrarily large
clusters. It currently has test runners for Rust and Python, with more
on the way. Maelstrom is reliable, easy to use, fast, and scalable.
The project is currently Linux-only and relies on namespaces to
implement containers.

 THE AI SUMMER (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ChatGPT happened incredibly fast, reaching 100 million users in just
2 months. A lot of its growth was due to the infrastructure built over
the last few decades - users could easily access the service on
devices they already owned. Most of the people who tried out ChatGPT
when it was first released have not returned. It's now easy for people
to try out new products, which makes for some interesting charts, but
keeping these users is another story. AI may be able to swallow most
or all of existing software and automate new classes of tasks, but not
this year. 

 EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM IS STUMBLING. CAN ‚ÄúMORAL AMBITION‚Äù REPLACE IT?
(13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Moral Ambition is a new movement that aims to create a new standard
of success by shifting ambition away from money and toward finding
solutions for the world's most pressing problems. It aims to restore
faith in human agency and ingenuity. The blend of socially conscious
activism and capitalist entrepreneurship encourages a willingness
among young people to use their talent and ambition for the common
good instead of personal profit and status. Unlike Effective Altruism,
which is grounded in guilt, Moral Ambition is built on enthusiasm,
compassion, and problem-solving.
