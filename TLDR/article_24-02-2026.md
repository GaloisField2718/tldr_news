 ANTHROPIC ACCUSES 3 CHINESE COMPANIES OF HARVESTING ITS DATA (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anthropic claims that DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax used
approximately 24,000 fraudulent accounts to train their own chatbots.
The process of distillation, where data from one AI system is used to
train another, is common in the AI industry. However, Anthropic's
terms forbid the practice and also do not allow its technologies to be
used in China. Anthropic has called on government officials and other
AI companies to help prevent Chinese companies from distilling
American models. 

 SPACEX, OPENAI, AND ANTHROPIC IPOS: A $3 TRILLION STRESS TEST (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic are set to IPO at an unprecedented
scale. Typical IPOs offer 15% to 25% of their shares to public
markets, which creates enough liquidity for price discovery while
allowing founders and early investors to maintain control. At standard
float percentages, these three companies need to raise $432 billion to
$576 billion from public markets in a single quarter. The entire US
IPO market raised $469 billion between 2016 and 2025. It is likely
these companies will debut with smaller floats.

 2026 GEOTHERMAL UPDATE (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The biggest projects in geothermal started construction around 18
months ago. The industry executed well enough to get a shot at true
commercial-scale deployments. The next few years will determine if the
wave of projects can lead to the success metric of '10% of electricity
generation'. While the first version of the technology seems possible,
subsequent versions and improvements that lead to scalability will be
much more challenging. The leading companies are still going strong,
which is promising. 

 SCENT, IN SILICO (35 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Attention has started turning to using AI to probe the possibility of
digitizing smell. Researchers hope that the ability to program smell
will illuminate the many mysteries of olfaction. Digital scent could
have many practical and quite profitable applications. This article
looks at the state of the technology and introduces the various
possible avenues for research.

 UNBLOCKED: THE CONTEXT LAYER YOUR AI TOOLS ARE MISSING (SPONSOR) [13]


 Give your agents the understanding they need to generate reliable
code, reviews, and answers. Unblocked [13] builds context from your
team's code, PR history, conversations, documentation, planning tools,
and runtime signals. It surfaces the insights that matter so AI
outputs reflect how your system actually works.

precision is wild.” - Senior developer, Clio_

 THE ENGINEERINGIFICATION OF EVERYTHING (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The line between technical and non-technical work is being redrawn.
The winners will be the ones who think like builders. Non-technical
people should try to take on more 'engineering' tasks as AI makes
tools more powerful and accessible. Engineers should use the same
tools to turn themselves into full-stack shipping machines. Companies
are investing billions to make engineers more powerful, so take
advantage of that investment. 

 WRITING CODE IS CHEAP NOW (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Coding agents have dramatically dropped the cost of producing code.
The ability to run parallel agents has compounded this effect.
However, delivering good code still has a cost. Developers still need
to ensure that the produced code is good code. The challenge is to
develop new personal and organizational habits to respond to the new
reality of agentic engineering.

POTENTIAL AI DYSTOPIAN SCENARIO (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A recently published paper called 'The 2028 Global Intelligence
Crisis' explores a hypothetical world in which there is an aggressive
AI build-out and adoption of AI agents. In this world, unemployment is
high despite elevated nominal growth and productivity, and the stock
market tumbles due to credit stress from companies laid low by AI
metastasizing. It illustrates how AI becoming good could leave many
industries vulnerable. This post provides a summary of the paper along
with a link to the original. 

 DON'T LOVE YOUR JOB? I HEAR YOU. BUT DON'T QUIT. AT LEAST, 99% OF YOU
SHOULDN'T (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Many jobs in tech aren't that rewarding anymore. AI has made it even
worse. However, leaving your current job without a plan right now
isn't a good idea because every CEO wants to get leaner. Companies
want to increase AI use rather than hire more people, so the scales
are weighted against employees. Use the time in your current job to
learn and grow more until you have a better place to go to.
