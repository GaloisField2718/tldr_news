 Caroline Ellison, the former head of FTX's sister investment firm,

collapse but helped testify against her former boyfriend and boss, Sam
Bankman-Fried, putting him in prison for 25 years. Ellison has been
ordered to forfeit $11 billion and must give the government any income
she receives from selling the rights to her story. The judge has
requested that she be sent to a low-security prison near where her
family lives. Her surrender date will be after November 7.

 IN THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED: WHEN NASA NEARLY GAVE BOEING ALL THE
CREW FUNDING (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This excerpt from the book 'REENTRY: SpaceX, Elon Musk and the
Reusable Rockets that Launched a Second Space Age' describes a meeting
at NASA headquarters 10 years ago where agency leaders met to decide
which companies should be awarded billions of dollars to launch
astronauts into orbit. The decision boiled down to three players:
Boeing, SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada Corporation. It came down to three
factors, price, mission suitability, and past performance, with price
being equally weighted to the latter two factors. The decision was
close, with NASA officials nearly choosing only Boeing for the
contract, but in the end, SpaceX was included.
