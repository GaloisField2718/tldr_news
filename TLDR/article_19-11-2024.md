 DOJ WILL PUSH GOOGLE TO SELL CHROME TO BREAK SEARCH MONOPOLY (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Justice Department antitrust officials will ask federal judge Amit
Mehta to force Alphabet to sell Google's Chrome browser as part of the
ruling that Google illegally monopolized the search market. They will
also ask to implement measures related to artificial intelligence and
Google's Android smartphone operating system. The proposals have the
potential to reshape the online search market and AI industry. States
are still considering adding some proposals and some details could
change. Google has plans to appeal the antitrust ruling. 

 NVIDIA'S DELAYED BLACKWELL AI CHIPS ARE OVERHEATING IN SERVERS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell GPUs are prone to overheating when
connected to each other on server racks. The issue is due to the
server rack designed for Blackwell, which can connect up to 72 GPUs at
a time. The racks have been redesigned, but this could cause further
delays. Nvidia originally said that the GPUs could ship as soon as Q2
2024 before it encountered challenges.

 A.I. CHATBOTS DEFEATED DOCTORS AT DIAGNOSING ILLNESS (8 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 ChatGPT outperformed doctors in diagnosing disease in a study that
looked at whether the chatbot could help doctors diagnose illnesses.
Doctors who had help from the chatbot performed only slightly better
than doctors without the tool, showing how doctors sometimes will
stick to their diagnoses even when presented with a potentially better
option. Many of the doctors didn't know how to use chatbots and
treated ChatGPT like a search engine for direct questions, which could
have affected results. Only a small fraction of the doctors copied the
entire case history into the chatbot and asked it to answer the entire
question. 

 SPACEX POISED FOR NEXT STARSHIP FLIGHT TEST NOV. 19 (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 SpaceX launched three Falcon 9 rockets in less than 24 hours on
November 17-18 ahead of a planned flight test of its Starship-Super
Heavy vehicle today. Falcon 9 has reached 113 launches this year and
398 since it debuted in June 2010. Starship Flight 6 is slated to
launch at around 5-5:30 PM from SpaceX's Starbase complex at Boca
Chica Beach, Texas. SpaceX is hoping to catch the Super Heavy booster
again using a pair of mechanical arms on its launch gantry and relight
a Raptor engine in flight. Starship will not reach orbital velocity
and will make a targeted splashdown in the Indian Ocean.

 RUST FOUNDATION RELEASES PROBLEM STATEMENT ON C++/RUST
INTEROPERABILITY (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Rust Foundation's problem statement on the challenges and
opportunities in C++ and Rust interoperability outlines three key
strategic approaches: improve existing tools and address tactical
issues within Rust to reduce interoperability friction and risk in the
short term, build consensus around long-term goals and develop the
tactical approaches to begin pursuing them, and engage with the C++
community and committee to improve the quality of interoperation for
both languages to help realize the mutual goals of safety and
performance. The 'interop initiative' was launched earlier this year
to make cross-language development more accessible and approachable
for the wider programming community.

 FILE OVER APP: A PHILOSOPHY FOR DIGITAL LONGEVITY (6 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Creating digital artifacts that last requires using open file formats
that are easy to retrieve and read. This means using tools that give
people this freedom. While it isn't always possible to choose 'file
over app', there are almost always options that allow users to export
their data, which can later be scraped into usable formats. This post
provides links to tools and projects that align with the 'file over
app' philosophy.
