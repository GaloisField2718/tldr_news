 QUALCOMM APPROACHED INTEL ABOUT A TAKEOVER IN RECENT DAYS (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Qualcomm has approached Intel about a takeover in what could be one
of the largest and most consequential deals in recent years. Intel is
currently suffering through one of its most significant crises in its
five-decade history. Its shares have dropped roughly 60% so far this
year. A deal is far from certain and it will likely attract antitrust
scrutiny. 

 META HAS A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY TO WIN THE AI HARDWARE RACE (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Meta smart glasses have succeeded where other AI wearables and smart
glasses haven't and even beyond Meta's own expectations. They're
expensive, but affordable compared to an Apple Vision Pro or a Humane
Pin, and they have good quality speakers, microphones, and cameras.
The AI is sometimes finicky and inelegant, but it works in a natural
way. The device easily slots into people's lives now, with no future
software update to wait for.

 MICROSOFT TAPS THREE MILE ISLAND NUCLEAR PLANT TO POWER AI (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Microsoft has signed a major deal with nuclear plant operator
Constellation Energy to buy power for its data centers from the energy
company's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant. Constellation plans
to spend $1.6 billion to revive the Unit 1 plant, which was shut down
in 2019 due to a lack of demand for nuclear energy, by 2028. Microsoft
has agreed to purchase all of the power from the reactor, which
promises a capacity of 835 megawatts once restored, over the next 20
years. The plant is expected to create 3,400 direct and indirect jobs,
add $16 billion to Pennsylvania's GDP, and generate more than $3
billion in state and federal taxes. 

 AUTOMATIC TAKEOFFS ARE COMING FOR PASSENGER JETS AND THEY'RE GOING TO
REDRAW THE MAP OF THE SKY (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The first automatic landing system was used in 1965. Now, nearly 60
years later, Brazil's Embraer, the world's third-largest aircraft
manufacturer, is introducing a similar technology for takeoffs. The E2
Enhanced Take Off system improves safety, range, and takeoff weight,
allowing planes that use it to travel further. It enables planes to
take off as early as possible, and more steeply, without ever
incurring a tail strike. Embraer has started flight testing the system
with the aim of getting it approved by aviation authorities by 2025.

 MAJORITY OF REDIS USERS CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVES AFTER LESS
PERMISSIVE LICENSING MOVE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The shift away from permissive open source licensing has motivated
the majority of Redis users to consider alternatives. Many are
considering or testing Valkey, a fork of Redis managed by the Linux
Foundation and backed by AWS, Google, Oracle, and others that was
prompted by the decision to switch licenses. Redis claims the decision
to change licenses was made to prevent AWS and Google from charging
for Redis in their database services without paying for it. It
anticipated the fork, as it was exactly what Amazon did with
Elasticsearch, but the company believes it is better for them to be
able to innovate freely without the fear of its code being taken by
cloud service providers and resold. 

 THE OPEN SOURCE PROJECT MAINTAINER'S GUIDE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This post provides a guide on how not to maintain an open source
project, highlighting mistakes that open source projects make that
discourage contributors from helping. These mistakes include using
source control mechanisms other than git, only accepting patches
through email, requiring a contributor license agreement, ignoring
detailed reports, and prioritizing features over bugs. Making it
easier for people to contribute makes people more likely to want to
contribute.

 AFTER APPLE, JONY IVE IS BUILDING AN EMPIRE OF HIS OWN (19 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 This article looks at Jony Ive's work post-Apple and his plans for
the future. Ive has quietly accumulated nearly $90 million worth of
real estate on a single city block in San Francisco. The purchases
began early in the pandemic when many tech luminaries were fleeing the
city. He has turned the buildings into home bases for his projects,
one for his agency's work on automotive fashion, and travel products
and another for a new artificial intelligence device company he is
developing with OpenAI. 

 THE CRYPTO BROS WHO DREAM OF CROWDFUNDING A NEW COUNTRY (13 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Balaji Srinivasan is a serial tech entrepreneur and venture
capitalist who believes that tech can do pretty much everything
governments currently do, but better. His vision of a network state
involves forming communities on the internet that acquire land and
become physical countries with their own laws, existing alongside
existing nation states and eventually replacing them altogether. These
network states would allow people to choose their nationality and
become citizens of the state of their choice. This article looks at
the network state movement and how it plans to replace governments
with companies.
