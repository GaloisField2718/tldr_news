 OPENAI LAUNCHES GPT-5 FREE TO ALL CHATGPT USERS (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has announced GPT-5 in three variants: GPT-5 Pro, GPT-5 mini,
and GPT-5 nano. Some of the models will be available across all
ChatGPT, including for free users. OpenAI claims the new model family
comes with reduced confabulations, improved coding capabilities, and a
new approach to handling sensitive requests. Free users now have
access to a simulated reasoning AI model. GPT-5 Pro is replacing
o3-pro in ChatGPT for those subscriber tiers with access to it. 

 MEET TBD LAB, META'S SUPERINTELLIGENCE SWAT TEAM (5 MINUTE READ) [6]

from rival labs. It is spearheading Work on the newest version of
Meta's large language model, Llama. The TBD Lab will work alongside
Meta's other AI teams on a variety of projects. Meta has to date
poached at least 18 researchers from OpenAI and a number from Google.

 FDA APPROVES BREAKTHROUGH EYE DROPS THAT FIX NEAR VISION WITHOUT
GLASSES (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The US Food and Drug Administration has approved an eye drop that
improves near vision in adults with presbyopia, a condition that
causes near-sighted vision loss. The aceclidine-based eye drops offer
relief from blurry near vision for up to 10 hours. They work by gently
shrinking the pupil of the eye, creating a pinhole effect that helps
bring nearby objects into sharper focus. The eyedrops do not
significantly affect the eye's focusing muscles, so using them doesn't
blur distance vision or cause myopic shift. 

 ELI LILLY SAYS ITS NEW WEIGHT-LOSS PILL IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Eli Lilly has developed a new pill that causes obese people to lose
significant amounts of weight. The drug targets GLP-1, potentially
increasing access to GLP-1 medications due to price and ease of
application. Its side effect profile is similar to that of the
injectable GLP-1 drugs. Eli Lilly plans to file for approval for the
drug by the end of the year.

 GPT-5 (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GPT-5 rarely screws up and generally feels competent. The model used
in ChatGPT is a hybrid that switches between different models. GPT-5
is available as three models in the API: regular, mini, and nano. Each
can be run at one of four reasoning levels. This post looks at the key
characteristics of the models, how they are priced, and what can be
learned from the GPT-5 system card. 

 BUILT WITH BORROWED HANDS (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ignore the claims about vibe coding or that you don't need to know
how to write code, and instead look for ways to augment what you do.
Experiment with AI and discover what value you can extract - there's a
lot of grift. Learn for yourself what works and what doesn't. AI in
its current form won't ever replace hands-on-keyboards, and it won't
replace engineering.

 THE NEXT PARENTING TREND STARTS BEFORE CONCEPTION (132 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Orchid is a company that lets parents genetically test embryos before
pregnancy. Parents can choose their future baby for as little as
$2,500. This article features a transcript of an interview with the
company's founder, where they debate the scientific, moral, and
ethical implications of designing a 'healthy' child and what we lose
in separating reproduction from sex. With Orchid's technology, parents
in the future will not have to roll the dice with their child's
health. 

 INTEL'S CEO, UNDER ATTACK FROM TRUMP, IS ALREADY AT ODDS WITH HIS
BOARD (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Intel's Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan and some Intel directors disagree
on topics as central as whether the company should stay in the
manufacturing business or exit it entirely. Tan recently tried to
raise new capital to acquire an artificial intelligence company, but
efforts have been stalled by people on the board. Despite Trump
unexpectedly calling for Tan's ouster, the company is so far standing
by Tan, saying that the board and Tan are all deeply committed to
advancing US national and economic security interests. While Intel's
chip factories are a money loser, some view them as politically
important because they help secure the US semiconductor supply chain.
