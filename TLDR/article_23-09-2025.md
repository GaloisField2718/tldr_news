 US-RUN TIKTOK TO LICENSE ALGORITHM, WHITE HOUSE SAYS (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Oracle will oversee the security of Americans' data and monitor
changes and updates to TikTok's recommendation technology under a new
deal. A copy of the recommendation engine that powers the app will be
licensed from China to an American investor group that will oversee
the app in the US. Oracle, along with private equity firm Silver Lake,
will also invest in the new American TikTok. The US-run TikTok will
work to retrain the algorithm on users' data in the US. China will not
have access to the data. 

 NVIDIA TO INVEST UP TO $100 BILLION IN OPENAI (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nvidia and OpenAI have a new partnership that includes plans for an
enormous data center buildout and a $100 billion investment by Nvidia
into OpenAI. The deal will allow OpenAI to build and deploy at least
10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for its artificial intelligence data
centers to train and run its next generation of models. It is a bet on
continued model improvements that runs contrary to the view of some
skeptics, who say model development is hitting a wall. Nvidia will
make its investment in OpenAI progressively as each gigawatt is
deployed.

 MOLTEN REGOLITH ELECTROLYSIS COULD MAKE MOON DUST USEFUL (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Blue Origin's Blue Alchemist is designed to transform lunar and
Martian regolith into solar power systems, breathable oxygen,
propellant, metals, and construction materials. Ensuring
sustainability requires that missions rely on local resources to
provide basic necessities. Blue Alchemist uses a molten regolith
electrolysis reactor, which uses electrical current to separate oxygen
from metals without water, toxic chemicals, or carbon emissions. Blue
Origin is on track to scale the system to make lunar landings up to
60% cheaper and reduce fuel-cell and battery masses by up to 70%. 

 GIZMODO SCIENCE FAIR: A NEW PILL TO TREAT SCHIZOPHRENIA—THE FIRST
IN 50 YEARS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Karuna Therapeutics and Bristol Myers Squibb's Cobenfy pill is the
first novel medication for schizophrenia in 50 years. The drug,
approved by the FDA last fall, reduces symptoms like hallucinations
without the adverse effects common in other antipsychotics, such as
weight gain. Cobenfy's approval was the culmination of an effort that
began over 15 years ago. Karuna Therapeutics and Bristol Myers Squibb
Won the 2025 Gizmodo Science Fair for their research.

 WHY WE BUILT THE RESPONSES API (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's Responses API unlocks persistent reasoning, hosted tools,
and multimodal workflows for GPT-5. It is tailor-made for reasoning
models and the agentic future. While Chat Completions isn't going
away, OpenAI expects Responses to eventually become the default way
developers build with OpenAI models. 

 WHY LOCAL-FIRST APPS HAVEN'T BECOME POPULAR? (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Very few apps get offline support right because syncing is hard.
Building a local-first app means effectively creating a distributed
system where multiple devices can mutate data independently, sometimes
offline, while still converging to the exact same state without losing
data. This involves solving the challenges of unreliable ordering and
conflicts. SQLite is a battle-tested, lightweight, and readily
available solution for local-first apps that guarantees convergence
across devices, regardless of the sync order.

 CLOUDFLARE'S 2025 ANNUAL FOUNDERS' LETTER (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Cloudflare launched in 2010 when less than 20% of the Internet was
encrypted - today, well over 95% is encrypted, thanks in part to its
efforts. The basic business model of the Internet for the past 15
years has been the same: create compelling content, find a way to be
discovered, then generate value from the resulting traffic. There's
always been a reward system that transferred value from consumers to
creators. Ads were previously the only micropayment system that worked
at scale to encourage an open Internet while also compensating content
creators for their work, but change is being driven by AI. This
article looks at how Cloudflare plans to navigate this change and what
the new Internet business model will look like. 

 GOOGLE'S AD MONOPOLY UNDER MICROSCOPE AS JUDGE WEIGHS REMEDIES (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Justice Department has asked a US District Judge to order Google
to divest AdX, an advertising exchange. It claims the divestiture
would enable meaningful change. Google claims that it would be a
radical solution that would remove the company from the
advertising-exchange business completely. Google plans to appeal the
ruling that it violated the law.
