 OPENAI'S O1-PRO IS THE COMPANY'S MOST EXPENSIVE AI MODEL YET (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has launched a more powerful version of its o1 reasoning model
in its developer API. o1-pro uses more computing to provide better
responses. It costs $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million
output tokens - ten times the price of regular o1. OpenAI's internal
benchmarks show that while o1-pro answers coding and math problems
more reliably, it only performs slightly better than the standard o1. 

 GOOGLE'S BUDGET-FRIENDLY PIXEL 9A IS FINALLY HERE, AND IT COMES WITH
A BOLD NEW LOOK (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google has finally launched the Pixel 9a. Starting at $499, the
device, which comes in four colors (Peony, Iris, Porcelain, and
Obsidian), is powered by the Google Tensor G4, Google's most efficient
processor so far. The Pixel 9a has a 6.3-inch display with 2,700 nits
of peak brightness and a 120 Hz adaptive refresh rate. It has a
battery life of 30 hours - over 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver
enabled. The device has a 13 MP ultra-wide camera and a 48 MP main
camera. It is the first Pixel A series device that features Macro
Focus.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 AMAZING NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN 'BEND' SOUNDS INTO YOUR EARS ONLY (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Scientists have discovered a way to create localized pockets of sound
isolated from their surroundings, creating sound exactly where it
needs to be. The technique involves using ultrasound as a carrier for
audible sound - ultrasound transports sound through space silently,
becoming audible only when desired. The ultrasonic beams can bend as
they travel, allowing for the creation of curved sound paths that can
navigate around obstacles and meet at a specific target location. Many
more details about how this technology works are available in the
article. 

 NOT EVERYONE IS CONVINCED BY MICROSOFT'S TOPOLOGICAL QUBITS (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Microsoft's quantum team made waves last month by announcing its
first topological quantum chip, the Majorana 1. Quantum computers run
on qubits valued at 0, 1, or some superposition of the two -
topological quantum computing is a fundamentally different approach to
building a qubit that would be theoretically less fragile. Proving the
claims that it has created at least a single topological qubit remains
difficult for the Microsoft team. Despite difficulties, topological
quantum continues to be a very promising approach.

 MAKING AI WORK IN LEGACY CODEBASES (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI can help engineers even when code bases are big and complex. This
article contains several examples of how to use AI on legacy code
bases. The examples contain prompts, processes, tool tips, links to
resources, and more for better understanding. 

 NOT ALL AI-ASSISTED PROGRAMMING IS VIBE CODING (BUT VIBE CODING
ROCKS) (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Vibe coding is building software with a large language model without
reviewing the code it writes. Making an AI write code, then reviewing
that code and testing it thoroughly is not vibe coding - that's just
software development. Vibe coding could grant millions of new people
the ability to build their own custom tools. It also has a ton to
offer experienced developers - it can help them build an intuition as
to what AI can and cannot do for them.

 ELON MUSK IS JOINING MICROSOFT IN $30 BILLION DATA CENTER PROJECT (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Microsoft, BlackRock, and MGX are partnering with xAI on a $30
billion project to develop data centers and other infrastructure. The
details of the new deal are unclear. The relationship between
Microsoft and OpenAI has increasingly cooled as Microsoft has loosened
its reliance on OpenAI and developed its own in-house AI models.
OpenAI recently announced its own $100 billion infrastructure project
with Oracle and SoftBank - an early sign that the companies were
starting to drift apart. 

 AI IS "TEARING APART" COMPANIES, SURVEY FINDS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Executives across the US have been pushing AI as an inevitable
revolution, but workers aren't buying it. Nearly all C-suite
executives are unsatisfied with their company's current AI solution -
over half say they're looking for new jobs with companies that are
more innovative with generative AI. While almost all C-suite
executives believe their companies have an AI strategy, just over half
of employees say their companies have an AI strategy at all. The
pushback from employees seems to stem from both fear of being replaced
by AI and AI tools not being suited for work.
