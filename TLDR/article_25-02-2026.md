 AIRIA: ENTERPRISE AI ORCHESTRATION THAT UNIFIES EXPERIMENTATION,
PROD, AND GOVERNANCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You want AI to be more than a never-ending work in progress, and that
means enabling no-code, low-code, and pro-code development without IT
gatekeepers standing in the way. Yet that doesn't mean governance goes
out the window.

Airia is the enterprise AI platform [4] built to drive AI adoption by
unifying innovation and security. Teams at Stryker, BuzzFeed, and
ArcelorMittal use it to:

 	* Test prompts, LLMs, and agent variants in safe, prod-like
environments 
 	* End AI anxiety by controlling agent sprawl and implementing
automatic guardrails [4]
 	* Discover risks, orchestrate agents, and monitor threats in one
place

Get a demo [4] and make AI adoption a reality

 PENTAGON GIVES ANTHROPIC ULTIMATUM AND DEADLINE IN AI USE STANDOFF (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic has until Friday to comply with the Pentagon's demands to
use its AI models for all lawful use cases, including mass domestic
surveillance or autonomous weapons, which Anthropic doesn't allow its
models to be used for. Failing to comply will mean the cancellation of
Anthropic's contract. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said he could
also label the company a supply-chain risk or invoke the Defense
Production Act to essentially force Anthropic to work more
collaboratively with the Pentagon. Designating a company as a
supply-chain risk would mean that businesses working with the Pentagon
would have to certify that they don't use Anthropic's models in any of
their work with the military. 

 META AND AMD AGREE TO AI CHIPS DEAL WORTH MORE THAN $100 BILLION (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta has agreed to buy 6 gigawatts' worth of AI computing power from
AMD in a deal valued at more than $100 billion. AMD has agreed to give
Meta warrants to buy up to 160 million AMD shares, roughly 10% of the
company, for $0.01 apiece, as long as certain milestones are met. Meta
said last week that it would buy several million of Nvidia's GPUs as
well, a deal expected to cost tens of billions of dollars. The company
plans to deploy tens of gigawatts of data center computing power this
decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time.

 GOOGLE MOONSHOT SPINOFF LOOKS TO SHIP CITY-SCALE LASER INTERNET (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Taara, a Google moonshot spin-off, plans to create urban data
highways made out of light. Taara Photonics is a wireless
communication platform based on optical phased arrays. The Taara Beam
transmits data wirelessly with Class 1M eye-safe lasers in the
unlicensed infrared band 193 THz. It can support speeds of up to 25
Gbps over a claimed range of up to 10 kilometers. The Taara
Lightbridge Pro can do double that distance. 

 DATA CENTERS ARE RACING TO SPACE — AND REGULATION CAN'T KEEP UP (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Over the past month, six American companies and a Chinese firm have
expressed interest in building data centers in space. Experts warn
that the projects could open governance loopholes, especially for
countries with little say in how they are run. Orbital data centers
could place critical infrastructure beyond regulatory reach for many
developing countries and deepen digital dependence. New frameworks
need to be built to prevent orbital compute from becoming an extension
of existing terrestrial monopolies.

 EXPERT PANEL: PLAID'S 6 FINTECH PREDICTIONS - AND WHY FRAUDSTERS ARE
THE TRUE EARLY ADOPTERS (SPONSOR) [9] 

 The heaviest users of AI in fintech aren't fintechs, they're
fraudsters. If you watch Plaid's 2026 Fintech Predictions [9], you'll
see why that won't change for a while. Plaid CEO Zach Perret, CTO Will
Robinson, and Credit Product Lead Michelle Young share their
predictions in the on-demand webinar. See what's coming [9] 

 WHAT ARE CHINESE PEOPLE VIBECODING? (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post takes a look at the many interesting coding projects that
developers, creatives, and entrepreneurs in China have been creating
with AI tools over the past year. Tinkering culture has no borders,
and companies are cashing in. Vibecoding is changing the landscape of
technology in China. Highlights include a lighting app that became the
most downloaded paid iPhone app in China, an app that suggests meet-up
locations, and a tool that generates elaborate greeting messages based
on occasion, style, and relationship with the intended recipient. 

 AI AND MY CRISIS OF MEANING (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 November was an inflection point with AI coding. Everyone now wants
their own custom app to solve their business problem, and it's easier
than ever to create one. Projects that should take weeks are being
one-shotted by Claude Code. Developers should take advantage of this
moment - in a few years, motivated people will be able to just do it
themselves.

 PAYPAL POPS NEARLY 7% ON REPORT FINTECH STARTUP STRIPE IS WEIGHING AN
ACQUISITION (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Stripe is reportedly considering buying all or some segments of
PayPal's business. PayPal has struggled with growth in an increasingly
competitive financial payments industry. Meanwhile, Stripe hit a $159
billion valuation on Tuesday, up from $91.5 billion a year ago.
Stripe's co-founder and president, John Collison, said that the
company isn't yet aiming for an IPO as that would sidetrack its
current product and business growth. 

 TECH FIRMS AREN'T JUST ENCOURAGING THEIR WORKERS TO USE AI. THEY'RE
ENFORCING IT (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Some tech firms have started tracking their workers' use of AI tools
with an eye on productivity gains, and in certain cases, factoring it
into performance reviews. There are jobs that aren't even considering
candidates unless they demonstrate AI fluency. AI adoption hasn't been
easy, as tech workers have many of the same feelings about AI as the
broader population, including skepticism about how much time it is
actually saving them. There's also the added anxiety about adopting a
technology that will cause them to eventually lose their jobs.
