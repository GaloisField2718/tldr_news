 OPENAI CONFIRMS NEW $200 MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION, CHATGPT PRO, WHICH
INCLUDES ITS O1 REASONING MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's new ChatGPT Pro subscription tier provides unlimited access
to all of OpenAI's models and a pro version of its o1 reasoning model.
It was created for those pushing the models to the limits of their
capabilities on tasks like math, programming, and writing. The pro
version of o1 is faster, more powerful, and more accurate than the
preview version released in September. All paid ChatGPT users can
still access the standard o1 model, which can now reason about image
uploads. o1 will soon be available in OpenAI's API.

LAUNCHES IN PREVIEW (3 MINUTE READ) [6]

can handle tasks like summarizing and translating text, spotlighting
discounted products in store catalogs, and serving as a game
assistant. It deletes data after every session to preserve privacy.

during the preview.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 PROTECTING UNDERSEA INTERNET CABLES IS A TECH NIGHTMARE (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A lot of the global communications and financial system hinges on a
few hundred cables of bundled glass fibers strung across ocean floors
around the world, each about the same diameter as a garden hose.
Defending these undersea fiber-optic cables from damage and sabotage
is increasingly challenging. While there are plans to create future
internet backup routes through satellites, the technology is still
only in a preliminary proof-of-concept stage and may be many years
away from being deployed. It is currently not possible to monitor all
1.5 million kilometers of communication cables in the water, but new
technologies are emerging that will make it easier to monitor activity
where damage is most likely to occur and potentially prevent
disruptions. 

 BITCOIN HITS $100,000 (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bitcoin hit $100,000 on Wednesday. The cryptocurrency has been
experiencing a massive upswing since Donald Trump, who is a crypto
supporter, won the 2024 presidential election. Trump recently
announced his intentions to nominate Paul Atkins, a crypto advocate,
to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission after Gary Gensler, a
noted crypto critic, resigns on Inauguration Day. Trump has vowed to
create a national stockpile of bitcoins to help wipe out US national
debt. Atkins has said before that the US' tough stance on
cryptocurrency has driven investors to other markets where regulations
are clearer. Shifting US regulations to be more accommodating could
bring those investments back to the US.
