 APPLE LAUNCHES NEW IPHONE 16E: HERE'S EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's iPhone 16e features an all-new design, an A18 chip, a
48-megapixel camera, full Apple Intelligence support, and the
first-ever Apple-designed 5G cellular modem, the C1 chip. It starts at
$599 for 128GB and will be available for pre-order tomorrow. The first
orders will arrive on February 28. Apple has discontinued the iPhone
SE along with the iPhone 14 Plus. The iPhone 14 will remain available
from Apple's channel partners but it has been removed from Apple's
website. 

 MICROSOFT DEPLOYS NEW STATE OF MATTER IN ITS FIRST QUANTUM COMPUTING
CHIP (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft's first quantum computing chip, Majorana 1, is the result
of nearly two decades of research in the field. Microsoft claims that
building the chip required the creation of an entirely new state of
matter called the topological state. Microsoft manufactured all the
parts for the chip in the US, which was possible because of the small
scale of the project. Quantum computing may end up being used to boost
Microsoft's other businesses rather than just being a stand-alone
category.

 MIGRAINE IS MORE THAN A HEADACHE — A RADICAL RETHINK OFFERS HOPE TO
ONE BILLION PEOPLE (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Progress in understanding migraines has started to advance beyond
focusing on just headaches. Researchers are now developing measures
for the cognitive symptoms of migraines. Measuring cognitive symptoms
is particularly important to show whether treatments are effective or
not. Previous treatment studies focused on headache severity, light
sensitivity, and nausea, but little else - cognitive symptoms are
commonly felt in between migraine attacks as well. It may require a
serious rethink about the causes of migraines in order to make it
possible to treat all the complexities of the condition. 

 NEW BOOK-SORTING ALGORITHM ALMOST REACHES PERFECTION (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Researchers have created a new algorithm that addresses the library
sorting problem: a challenge to devise a strategy for organizing books
in some kind of sorted order that minimizes how long it takes to place
a new book on the shelf. The problem applies to the arrangement of
files on hard drives and in databases. An inefficient system means
significant wait times and major computational expense. The new
algorithm is very close to the theoretical ideal.

 TRUE AGI MEANS 10% ECONOMIC GROWTH, SAYS SATYA NADELLA (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella says that true AGI should be measured
by economic growth rather than AI advancements alone. The real
benchmark for AGI's success, according to Nadella, should be global
economic growth reaching 10%. The primary beneficiaries of AI
advancements will be industries that use AI to drive productivity. The
increased productivity will cause the economy to grow at a faster
rate. 

 THE ODDS OF A CITY-KILLER ASTEROID IMPACT IN 2032 KEEP RISING. SHOULD
WE BE WORRIED? (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The odds of an asteroid, designated 2024 YR4, hitting Earth eight
years from now continue to increase. Two weeks ago, the odds of the
asteroid striking our planet were estimated at 1.9% - the most recent
estimate has the likelihood at 3.2%. The asteroid is large enough to
cause devastation near its impact site localized to a roughly
city-sized area. This article contains an interview with Robin George
Andrews, author of the recently published book How to Kill an
Asteroid, where Andrews discusses what the impact odds mean and what
humanity's plans are in the case of possible impact.
