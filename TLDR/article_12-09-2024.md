 THE PATH TO BECOMING ENTERPRISE READY: 3 DEVELOPER'S GUIDES TO GET
STARTED (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you have ambitions to sell software to enterprise customers,
single sign-on [5] and SCIM provisioning [6] are likely non-negotiable
features you must support. These are important for security, user
lifecycle management, and access control. Here are 3 TECHNICAL GUIDES
FROM WORKOS:

 	* A guide to organization modeling [7] ‚Äî How your app handles
users, teams, and the relationships between the two ‚Äî is an
important but often overlooked part of building authentication and
authorization into your app.
 	* The developer's guide to SSO [8] ‚Äî A deep dive into the SAML
authentication flow, XML nuances, and why rolling your own SSO is so
challenging.
 	* Unlocking the power of SCIM: streamlining enterprise user
management [4] ‚Äî Besides secure user deprovisioning, SCIM can unlock
additional use cases such as pre-provisioning, automated access
management, and more.

Start selling to enterprises with just a few lines of code. [9]

 OPENAI FUNDRAISING SET TO VAULT STARTUP'S VALUATION TO $150 BILLION
(3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI is in talks to raise $6.5 billion from investors at a
valuation of $150 billion. It is also in talks to raise $5 billion in
debt from banks in the form of a revolving credit facility. The
discussions are still ongoing and the terms could change. The
financing will support the need for computing power and other
operating expenses. OpenAI is aiming to allow employees to sell some
of their shares in a tender offer later this year. 

 GOOGLE WILL NOW LINK TO THE INTERNET ARCHIVE TO ADD MORE CONTEXT TO
SEARCH RESULTS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google Search results now directly link to The Internet Archive to
add historical contexts for the links in results. It had removed its
cached pages feature from Search earlier this year. The feature can be
accessed by tapping on 'More about this page' through the three-dots
menu that appears alongside all search results. It is still rolling
out - a screenshot is available in the article.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 ORACLE IS DESIGNING A DATA CENTER THAT WOULD BE POWERED BY THREE
SMALL NUCLEAR REACTORS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Oracle is designing a data center that will require more than a
gigawatt of power. It will be powered by three small modular nuclear
reactors. Oracle has already received building permits for the
reactors but hasn't publicly disclosed the location of the data center
or future reactors. There are currently three operational small
modular reactors in the world, with experts in the industry generally
agreeing that the technology won't be commercialized in the US until
the 2030s. 

 PROPOSED UNDERWATER DATA CENTER SURPRISES REGULATORS WHO HADN'T HEARD
ABOUT IT (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 NetworkOcean launched out of Y Combinator on August 15 by announcing
plans to dunk a small capsule filled with GPU servers into the San
Francisco Bay. The founders say that moving data centers off land
would slow ocean temperature rise by drawing less power and letting
seawater cool the capsules' shells. Scientists say that the slightest
heat or disturbance from the submersibles could trigger toxic algae
blooms and harm wildlife. The startup has been pursuing its initial
test without seeking any permits from key regulators. It intends to
test its submersible for about an hour in an area it says is privately
owned and not subject to regulatory oversight.

 EVOLVING CX: IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE AND SECURITY OF ONLINE CUSTOMER
EXPERIENCES (SPONSOR) [14] 

 This eBook [14] covers 4 enterprise drivers to continuously evolve
CXs, and how modern unified observability is critical to deliver on
intended benefits. These drivers include state-of-the-art technology,
analytics for IT systems data, modern security and data protection,
and a culture of collaboration. Get the eBook from Datadog [14] 

 THE MODERN CLI RENAISSANCE (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The rate at which new CLI tools are being written has picked up over
the past few years after seeing relatively little activity between
1995 and 2015. This article discusses the trend where people are
rewriting and rethinking staples of the command line interface, why
the trend may be happening, and why the trend is a good thing. New
tools have the opportunity to learn from their predecessors and build
upon them. While the new tools may not be perfect, they are a result
of software becoming more polished and adapted to new use cases. 

 FELAFAX (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Felafax is a framework for continued-training and fine-tuning of open
source large language models using the XLA runtime. It takes care of
the runtime setup while providing a Jupyter notebook to get started.
The project aims to build the infrastructure to make it easier to run
AI workloads on non-Nvidia hardware. Felafax is easy-to-use,
easy-to-configure, and easy-to-scale.

 LIVE FROM SAN FRANCISCO: MARK ZUCKERBERG TAPES A PODCAST WITH 6,000
FRIENDS (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Mark Zuckerberg recorded a podcast about artificial intelligence, the
metaverse, and how he outmaneuvered the rest of Silicon Valley to keep
his company winning at a live event with more than 6,000 attendees who
paid $50 or more for a ticket. The event included appearances from
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase; Daniel Ek, the
founder of Spotify; and Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia.
Tech billions and top executives have been increasingly opting to tell
their stories in the friendly spaces of podcasts and YouTube streams
rather than in traditional media interviews as they allow guests more
leeway to expound on their pursuits and passions. The democratization
of media has allowed anyone to have a personal talk show, and those in
powerful positions now have a wide array of options to choose from
when they want to reach the public. 

 THE PALACE COUP AT THE MAGIC KINGDOM (73 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This article tells the inside story of how Bob Iger undermined and
outmaneuvered Bob Chapek to return to power at Disney. Chapek was
Iger's chosen successor after Iger stepped down in late February 2020.
Iger stayed in the company as a creative director and executive
chairman of the board after stepping down as chief executive. Chapek
was still required to report to Iger, resulting in conflict. The board
ultimately fired Chapek just before Thanksgiving in 2022 and replaced
him with Iger.
