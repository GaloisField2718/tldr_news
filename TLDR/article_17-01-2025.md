 IT'S OFFICIAL: TAKE A FIRST LOOK AT THE SWITCH 2 (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nintendo has unveiled the Switch 2 with a trailer and promo website.
The new device has a larger screen, a slightly more rounded edge on
the top and bottom, an additional USB-C port on the top, and a wider
kickstand that can support the system at a number of wider angles. The
Joy-Cons are significantly larger than those on the original Switch.
They have wider shoulder buttons and a new connector in the center.
The Joy-Cons now snap in horizontally instead of having to slide in
vertically. Pictures of the device are available in the article. 

 TIKTOK BAN POISED TO BE DELAYED AS TRUMP EXPLORES WAYS TO EXTEND
DEADLINE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The ban on TikTok in the US may be delayed as the deadline falls on
the MLK Day holiday weekend. Biden officials see the ban as an issue
for the Trump administration, so there are no plans to intervene
before the ban's January 19 deadline. An official has said that users
should not expect the social network to shut down on Sunday. The
Supreme Court is currently weighing whether to pause the law.

 BLUE ORIGIN REACHES ORBIT ON FIRST FLIGHT OF ITS TITANIC NEW GLENN
ROCKET (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blue Origin has reached orbit for the first time since its founding
nearly a quarter of a century ago. The launch occurred on Thursday
morning, a little more than an hour into its launch window. While the
first stage did not successfully return to Earth, the debut launch of
the New Glenn rocket was a smashing success. SpaceX required 19
launches before it finally landed an orbital rocket for the first
time, so it was unlikely Blue Origin would have succeeded on the first
attempt. 

 SPACEX CATCHES STARSHIP BOOSTER A SECOND TIME, LOSES SHIP TO AN
‘ANOMALY' IN SPACE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SpaceX caught Starship's Super Heavy booster for a second time on
Thursday. However, an anomaly with the upper stage caused it to
disappear after eight and a half minutes into the flight. The Federal
Aviation Administration slowed or diverted a number of flights in the
area where debris was spotted. SpaceX believes that the incident was
caused by an oxygen/fuel leak inside Starship that built up too much
pressure inside the cavity of the craft. A link to a video of the
debris falling back to Earth shared by Elon Musk is available in the
article.

 GOOGLE REPORTS HALVING CODE MIGRATION TIME WITH AI HELP (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Google computer scientists have released a paper describing how the
company uses AI for internal code migrations. The company's focus is
on bespoke AI tools developed for specific product areas instead of
generic AI tools that provide broadly applicable services. While
humans were needed to double-check the AI's work, it is estimated that
AI helped reduce the time required to complete a code migration by
50%. The researchers note that large language models should be used in
conjunction with other tools to prevent the human review process from
becoming a bottleneck and to reduce costs. 

 FIVE YEARS OF REACT NATIVE AT SHOPIFY (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Shopify switched to React Native for three reasons: to stop building
the same features twice, enable devs to work fluently across iOS,
Android, and Web, and ship more value. The transition was successful,
increasing productivity, allowing teams to do more with the same
number of people, and freeing up capacity to ship more value. Shopify
has now migrated all of its apps to React Native. This article
discusses the lessons the team learned along the way.

 TOYOTA'S FUTURISTIC WOVEN CITY IN JAPAN IS READY FOR ITS FIRST
RESIDENTS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Toyota's Woven City, a $10 billion project being built on the site of
a former car factory in Japan, is almost ready for its first
residents. The city is supposed to be a 'living laboratory' where
people can live while testing out futuristic projects. It will allow
residents to test out inventors' ideas in a secure real-life setting.
Toyota will welcome its first 100 residents, all of whom will be
Toyota employees or its subsidiary, Woven by Toyota, to the city in
the fall of 2025. The first phase of the city will eventually house
360 residents. A concept video that details Toyota's plans is
available in the article. 

 HERE'S WHAT NASA WOULD LIKE TO SEE SPACEX ACCOMPLISH WITH STARSHIP

Starship, the launch of a ship into low-Earth orbit, in-orbit
refueling, and more. The company aims to fly as many as 25 Starship
missions this year. It is building a second launch pad to speed up the
launch cadence. This article discusses the space startup's plans for
the year - it includes a transcript of an interview with Lisa
Watson-Morgan, the NASA engineer overseeing the agency's contract with
SpaceX.
