 MISTRAL CEO CONFIRMS ‚ÄòLEAK‚Äô OF NEW OPEN SOURCE AI MODEL NEARING
GPT-4 PERFORMANCE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Files for a quantized version of Mistral were leaked on HuggingFace
on around January 28. Quantization is a technique that makes it
possible to run certain AI models on less powerful computers and
chips. The model surpasses every other LLM in the world except GPT-4
on EQ-Bench. Mistral appears to still be working on the model, so the
final version may be even more capable.

minutes. A video about the project is available in the article.

 THE PERFORMANCE INEQUALITY GAP, 2024 (35 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Performance is a deep and nuanced domain. There's a lot that can go
wrong and how sites manage resources after-load can have huge impacts
on perceived performance. Global baselines matter as many teams have
low performance management maturity and many popular frameworks fail
to ward against catastrophic results. This article looks at current
web technologies to provide an up-to-date understanding for working
web developers. It looks at what's changed since last year and what
technologies new projects should consider.

worldwide. While many of these products are still limited, the

massively transform. This article looks at the biggest developments so
far in AI video generation, companies to keep an eye on, and the
remaining underlying questions in the space. 

 HOW HARD IS IT TO CHEAT WITH CHATGPT IN TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS? WE RAN
AN EXPERIMENT (21 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 ChatGPT can assist people during their technical interviews. An
experiment on how much the tool can help and how easy it is to cheat
uncovered an urgent need for companies to immediately change the types
of interview questions they're asking. Interviewees in the study were
able to trick professional interviewers and pass interviews without
the interviewers suspecting them of cheating. Not only were
interviewees not caught cheating, the interviewers also rated their
confidence in their hiring decisions as high.
