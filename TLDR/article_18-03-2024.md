 OPEN RELEASE OF GROK-1 (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 xAI has released the weights and architecture for Grok-1. Grok-1 is a
Mixture-of-Experts model with 314 billion parameters. The released
model is a raw base model checkpoint from the Grok-1 pretraining
phase, which means that it is not fine-tuned for any specific
application. It was trained from scratch by xAI using a custom
training stack. 

 TWO NEW AIRPODS 4 MODELS EXPECTED TO LAUNCH IN SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER
(1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The fourth generation of AirPods is set to begin production in May.
They will likely be released in September or October. The upcoming
AirPods are expected to feature a new design with better fit, improved
sound quality, and an updated charging case with a USB-C port. The
higher-end models will also feature active noise cancellation and a
speaker in the charging case for Find My location tracking. New
AirPods Pros are not expected to launch until next year at the
earliest, but current models may get a new hearing aid mode with iOS
18.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 VR HEADSETS ARE APPROACHING THE EYE‚ÄôS RESOLUTION LIMITS (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Extremely high pixel density is key for the next generation of
augmented, mixed, and virtual reality headsets. More pixels means more
life-like visuals and smaller, more compact displays. Building
displays at this scale leads to unique technical hurdles that the
industry is still learning to leap. This article looks at
technological developments in the space, the specific challenges the
industry is trying to overcome, and current solutions for these
challenges. 

 TICK-KILLING PILL SHOWS PROMISING RESULTS IN HUMAN TRIAL (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Tarsus Pharmaceuticals is developing a pill that could provide
protection against Lyme disease for several weeks at a time. An
early-stage trial has shown that it can kill ticks on people for up to
30 days after 24 hours of ingestion. The drug only kills the ticks,
rather than the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. It may also protect
against other tick-borne diseases.

 ASK HN: IF YOU'VE USED GPT-4-TURBO AND CLAUDE OPUS, WHICH DO YOU
PREFER? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [11] 

 This Hacker News thread compares GPT-4-Turbo, the default model in
ChatGPT Plus, to Claude Opus, Anthropic's competing model. Most
developers seem to prefer Claude as it is apparently better at coding
and engineering work. Its writing style also seems to be preferred,
but part of that is due to the recognizability of GPT-4-Turbo's style.
OpenAI's app functionalities, like its code interpreter and ability to
search the internet, are still big reasons to continue using ChatGPT
Plus. 

 PG_HINT_PLAN (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 pg_hint_plan allows developers to tweak PostgreSQL execution plans
using hints in SQL comments. Planners estimate the costs of each
possible execution plan for a SQL statement then execute the plan with
the lowest cost. While PostgreSQL's planner does its best to select
the best execution plan using its cost-based optimizer, which uses
data statistics rather than static rules, it is far from perfect as it
doesn't count some data properties. pg_hint_plan has hints to control
scan methods, join methods, join order, behavior on join, row number
correction, parallel query configuration, and more.

 AFTER THURSDAY‚ÄôS FLIGHT, STARSHIP IS ALREADY THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY
ROCKET EVER BUILT (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SpaceX's cameras recorded unprecedented views of atmospheric heating
acting on Starship for a couple of minutes during Starship's descent
on its third test. These views were possible thanks to Starlink
terminals on the ship sending signals to satellites in low-Earth
orbit, which were then sent back to Earth. The low-Earth orbit
satellites were in space thanks to SpaceX's reusable Falcon 9 rocket,
which conducted its first land-based landing days before Christmas in
2015. This article looks at the achievements that made Starship
possible and takes a peek at the future of the project. The video of
Starship reentering the atmosphere is available in the article. 

 STUBBORN VISIONARIES & PIGHEADED FOOLS (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Both success through perseverance and failure through obstinance are
convenient rationalizations. It is impossible to know the future for
anything. Understanding this frees you to make decisions more easily,
with less second-guessing in the moment and less guilt afterwards. You
can not know whether you're in a winning or losing scenario, so the
best you can do is to find out which one you are in as quickly as
possible. This article presents some guiding questions to help you
figure out which path you're on.
