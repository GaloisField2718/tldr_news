 THE PRAGMATIC OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTOR (23 MINUTE READ) [9]

fix tooling that isn't enabling them to do the best job they can. That
mindset influences all aspects of the contribution process. This
article discusses how to contribute to open source projects once you
have identified a potential contribution. Working on open source
technology can provide developers with a great opportunity to spot
issues and areas of improvement that can benefit everyone. 

 THE CASE AGAINST CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACES (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Natural language is a slow method of data transfer and it isn't the
best method to interact with computers. It takes much longer to say
'What's the weather like today?' than to simply tap on the weather app
icon on a device. While the quality of large language model output is
improving at an astonishing rate, the input modality is a step
backwards from what we already have. We shouldn't have to describe a
desired action using natural language when we could simply press a
button or keyboard shortcut. The technology should instead complement
existing methods, acting as an additional input mechanism that
increases the bandwidth of data transfer to make human-computer
interaction feel effortless.

 DEEPMIND IS HOLDING BACK RELEASE OF AI RESEARCH TO GIVE GOOGLE AN
EDGE (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 DeepMind has introduced a tougher vetting process and more
bureaucracy to make it harder to publish studies about its work on AI.
It has been most reluctant to share papers that reveal innovations
that could be exploited by competitors or research that casts Google's
Gemini model in a negative light. This is a significant shift for the
company, which has long prided itself on its reputation for releasing
groundbreaking papers. The company still publishes hundreds of papers
each year and is among the largest contributors to major AI
conferences. 

 TECH'S BIG ANXIETY: FEWER JOBS, LOWER PAY, MORE AI (9 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Until recently, there were abundant jobs in tech. Today, an
increasing number of people are stuck in job-search purgatory. AI is
transforming the job market - some companies have publicly stated that
they do not plan to hire engineers this year due to AI. Workers are
being pushed harder to keep what they have. Students are advised to
learn how to use AI tools and look for jobs at smaller companies -
many tend to underestimate how applicable and transferable their
skills are.
