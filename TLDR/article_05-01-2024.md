 MICROSOFT‚ÄôS NEW COPILOT KEY IS THE FIRST BIG CHANGE TO WINDOWS
KEYBOARDS IN 30 YEARS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Microsoft partners will start shipping a new Copilot key on a variety
of new PCs and laptops. The button will provide quick access to
Microsoft's AI-powered Windows Copilot experience. It is the first big
change to the Windows PC keyboard layout in nearly three decades. The
new Copilot key will replace the menu (or application) key. If Windows
Copilot isn't available in the user's country, the button will launch
Windows Search instead. It is unclear whether Microsoft plans to allow
users to use the key in combination with other keys. 

 GOOGLE APPEARS TO BE WORKING ON AN ‚ÄòADVANCED‚Äô VERSION OF BARD
THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bard Advanced is an upgraded version of Bard that may soon be
available through a paid subscription to Google One. It appears to be
powered by Gemini Ultra, an upgrade over the current version of Bard
which runs the mid-tier Gemini Pro. There may be a feature that allows
users to create custom bots, but it is unclear whether users will be
able to share these bots. It is unknown when or if the feature will
become official.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 GOOGLE WROTE A ‚ÄòROBOT CONSTITUTION‚Äô TO MAKE SURE ITS NEW AI
DROIDS WON‚ÄôT KILL US (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The DeepMind robotics team has revealed three new advances that will
help robots make faster, better, and safer decisions in the wild. One
involves a system for gathering training data with a set of
safety-focused prompts instructing the model to avoid choosing tasks
that involve humans, animals, sharp objects, and electrical
appliances. The others are a neural network architecture designed to
make the existing Robotic Transformer RT-2 more accurate and faster
and RT-Trajectory, which adds 2D outlines to help robots better
perform specific physical tasks. 

 ELON MUSK: SPACEX NEEDS TO BUILD STARSHIPS AS OFTEN AS BOEING BUILDS
737S (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Elon Musk recently made a post on X saying that SpaceX might need to
make up to 300 spaceships a year to achieve Mars colonization.
Establishing a settlement on Mars will require rocket travel to be
nearly as routine as air travel. While SpaceX will be able to reuse
Starship and its Super Heavy boosters, the parts that travel into
orbit won't be able to be reused as often. Ships often have to orbit
the planet several times before they line up with pickup sites, so
they might only be able to be used once a day.

 TERMINAL SMOOTH SCROLLING (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Terminal usually draws lines of text at fixed intervals. When
scrolling, the sudden jumps are incompatible with how eyes track
motion, making it a blurry mess that's hard to read. This blog post
discusses how to implement smooth scrolling in Terminal. While smooth
scrolling uses a lot more resources, it makes it possible to easily
skim text as it scrolls by. A video demonstrating the difference
between normal scrolling and smooth scrolling in Terminal is available
in the post. 

 MISE-EN-PLACE (WEBSITE) [10] 

 mise-en-place manages dev tools like Node, Python, CMake, Terraform,
and more. It manages environment variables for different project
directories and tasks used to build and test projects. It can also
work as a task runner that can replace make or npm scripts.

 AMAZON CAPTURED 29% OF ONLINE ORDERS BEFORE CHRISTMAS (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Amazon's global order volume in the final two weeks before Christmas
was up 21% from the week of Thanksgiving and Black Friday. The
company's speedy delivery is a key competitive advantage. 70% of Prime
orders in the US arrive within two days, with almost a quarter being
delivered within a day. Amazon plans to double its number of same-day
delivery facilities in the coming years. 

 OPENAI‚ÄôS APP STORE FOR GPTS WILL LAUNCH NEXT WEEK (3 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 OpenAI's GPT Store will feature custom apps based on its
text-generating AI models. Developers will have to review OpenAI's
updated usage policies and GPT brand guidelines as well as verify
their user profiles before they will be eligible for listing in the
store. Making a bot doesn't require any coding experience - developers
can just type the capabilities they want their bots to offer in plain
language and a GPT-building tool will attempt to make it. Bots can be
as simple or complex as a developer wishes. It is unclear whether the
GPT Store will launch with a revenue-sharing scheme.

 WHEN "EVERYTHING" BECOMES TOO MUCH: THE NPM PACKAGE CHAOS OF 2024 (5
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 An npm package called 'everything' released in the new year that
depended on every other public npm package, creating millions of
transitive dependencies, caused storage space to run out and system
resource exhaustion for anyone that installed it. 

 THE PULSE: WILL US COMPANIES HIRE FEWER ENGINEERS DUE TO SECTION 174?
(18 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Section 176 of the US tax law made it so all costs related to R&D
cannot be expensed, making bootstrapped software businesses completely
unsustainable.
