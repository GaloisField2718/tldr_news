TLDR 2025-07-18

 AFTER 21 YEARS, BASECAMP REMAINS THE MOST REFRESHINGLY
STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY TO MANAGE PROJECTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 There's big investor money in project management. That's a big
incentive to make bloated, barely-useable products — designed to
tick boxes in a procurement manager's checklist.

Basecamp [4] has been bucking this trend for more than two decades.
It's famously no-nonsense, effective, and reliable [4]. It's designed
for smaller, hungrier businesses who just need to get things done.

And it's still going strong — without spending hundreds of millions
of VC dollars on marketing.

No superbowl ads. No tacked-on AI.

Just the features you need to manage projects — from chat (bye bye
Slack) to Kanban to docs.

 OPENAI'S NEW CHATGPT AGENT CAN CONTROL AN ENTIRE COMPUTER AND DO
TASKS FOR YOU (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ChatGPT Agent is a new tool from OpenAI that completes work on users'
behalf using its own virtual computer. It is powered by a new unnamed
model that OpenAI developed specifically for the product. The model
was trained on complex tasks that require multiple tools, like
briefing users on upcoming client meetings, planning and purchasing
ingredients for a meal, or creating a slide deck based on an analysis
of competing companies. ChatGPT Agent is now rolling out to Pro, Plus,
and Team users - it will be available to Enterprise and Education
users later this summer. There is no rollout timeline for the European
Economic Area and Switzerland. 

 THIS UPCOMING IOS FEATURE WILL MAKE SPAM PHONE CALLS AN ISSUE OF THE
PAST (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple announced two new features to vastly improve the phone calling
experience for iPhone users this year at WWDC25: Hold Assist and Call
Screening. Hold Assist manages calls for users when placed on hold.
Call Screening, designed to deter spam callers, answers calls for
users and asks callers for their names and reasoning. iOS 26 will also
introduce a screening filter for texts.

 IVF BREAKTHROUGH USING 3‑PERSON DNA LEADS TO 8 BABIES BORN FREE OF
GENETIC DISEASE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Eight babies were born healthy thanks to a groundbreaking new
DNA-enhanced IVF technique aimed at preventing children from
inheriting severe, incurable mitochondrial diseases from their
mothers. The babies were born to seven mothers at high risk of passing
on severe mitochondrial DNA diseases. The novel IVF method utilizes
DNA from the mother's egg, the father's sperm, and healthy
mitochondrial DNA from a donor. Children conceived via this technique
inherit the vast majority of their DNA from their biological parents,
but they also receive a minute amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA
from a third person, a genetic alteration that will be passed down to
future generations. 

 NASA'S NEW ROMAN SPACE TELESCOPE AIMS TO DISCOVER 100,000 COSMIC
EXPLOSIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope has a field of view at least
100 times larger than Hubble's. It has the potential to document light
from over a billion galaxies over its career. The telescope will help
researchers better understand exoplanets, infrared astrophysics, and
the nature of dark matter. Roman could potentially find evidence of
the very first stars to ever form in the universe. The telescope is
scheduled to launch in 2027.

and boost productivity. tsx enhances Node.js with TypeScript support
in both CommonJS and ESM modes, allowing users to switch between them
seamlessly.

 HOW ANDROID PHONES BECAME AN EARTHQUAKE WARNING SYSTEM (6 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 The Android Earthquake Alert system, which is on by default in most
Android phones, displays a notification to users when there is an
earthquake nearby to warn them to get to a safer location. The system
uses accelerometers to detect vibrations - an alert is triggered when
there is widespread phone activity that matches the pattern expected
for an earthquake. As of the end of March last year, the system has
sensed a total of 1,279 events, ranging in magnitude from 1.9 to 7.8,
of which only three were false positives.
