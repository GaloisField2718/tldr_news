 APPLE LAUNCHES INVITES, A NEW APP FOR CREATING CUSTOM INVITATIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's new Invites app allows users to create, share, and RSVP to
events. It also allows users to contribute to Shared Albums and create
event soundtracks. The app requires an iCloud+ subscription, but
anyone can RSVP to events regardless of whether they have an Apple
account or device. Invites is now available for free on the App Store
for all iPhones running on iOS 18 or later and can be accessed on the
web. 

 OPENAI'S SORA FILMMAKING TOOL MEETS RESISTANCE IN HOLLYWOOD (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has been talking to the movie industry's largest studios for
months, but those talks have yet to produce any deals. Studios are
reluctant to get into business with an AI company as it may anger the
labor unions that they work with. Screenwriters and actors have been
urging studios to police tech companies and ensure that their work
isn't being used illegally. OpenAI found a receptive audience among
some filmmakers when it released its Sora AI video generator early
last year, but conversations with studios have been more complicated.
While studios recognize that AI is already changing how people work,
they are reluctant to hand over their most valuable assets to large
tech firms without receiving a significant payout.

 WITH GENERATIVE AI, MIT CHEMISTS QUICKLY CALCULATE 3D GENOMIC
STRUCTURES (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 MIT chemists have figured out a new method for determining 3D genome
structures using generative artificial intelligence. The technique can
predict thousands of structures in minutes. It can be used to easily
study how the 3D organization of the genome affects individual cells'
gene expression patterns and functions. It could also be used to
explore how mutations in DNA sequences can cause disease. The model
and all of the data are available on GitHub. 

 OUR BRAINS ARE SOAKING UP MICROPLASTICS MORE THAN OTHER ORGANS (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Microplastics have been detected in human brains at much higher
concentrations than in other organs. Much of the plastic appears to be
smaller than previously thought, with some pieces only about two to
three times the size of a virus. People diagnosed with dementia had up
to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as others, but there is
not enough evidence to definitively conclude on cause or effect. It is
unknown what effect microplastics have on human health, but the
tiniest pieces can cross the blood-brain barrier.

 BEEJ'S GUIDE TO GIT (WEBSITE) [9] 

 Git is a version control system that keeps snapshots of source code
in directory trees. It allows users to make changes and then commit
those changes to the source code repository once a feature is ready.
Git keeps a history of all commits made, so users can look at previous
commits whenever required. This page contains a guide to Git that
covers the basics and how to use it. It assumes readers have basic
POSIX shell usage skills and that they are working in a Unix-like
environment. 

 HOW I USE LLMS AS A STAFF ENGINEER (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post discusses how a staff engineer from GitHub who worked
directly on Copilot uses large language models. Large language models
can be helpful for smart autocomplete, short tactical chains, writing
use-once-and-throwaway research code, asking questions to learn about
new topics, last-resort bug fixes, and proofreading. The technology
still isn't great for writing PR, ADRs, or other technical
communications. It also isn't great for research in large codebases.

 CHAT IS A BAD UI PATTERN FOR DEVELOPMENT TOOLS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coding forces humans to think like machines. While programming has
become more friendly throughout the decades, we are still just
translating human thoughts into computer instructions. AI was supposed
to allow plain English to become a programming language, but it isn't
suitable for building serious software. Current tools pretend that
writing software is like having a conversation, but real software
can't be built without being precise about requirements. Companies
need to build tools for real software instead of toys. 

 OPENAI HAS UNDERGONE ITS FIRST EVER REBRAND, GIVING FRESH LIFE TO
CHATGPT INTERACTIONS (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI has unveiled a crisp new look for its brand and products. The
company has, until now, presented itself with a jumble of fonts,
marks, and colors that lack cohesion. The new identity is more organic
and human while still presenting a sense of authority, technological
sophistication, and research-focused underpinnings. It is present
through the interface and presentation of all of the company's
products. This article takes a detailed look at the design.
