 DETECT 3B OMNI IS A BENCHMARK-BEATING DEEPFAKE DETECTION MODEL THAT
WORKS ACROSS CONTENT TYPES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Deepfakes now span image, voice, and video. They're flooding the
internet and being used in sophisticated social engineering attacks.
But detection tools are getting better as well.

Resemble AI's DETECT-3B Omni [4] is a multimodal AI model trained on 3
billion parameters to deliver unified deepfake protection across all
content types. Released a few days ago, it's now the leading deepfake
detector on HuggingFace [4], ranked #1 on Speech DeepFake Arena and
DFBench with 94-99% accuracy rates.

 BEZOS AND MUSK RACE TO BRING DATA CENTERS TO SPACE (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Google are racing to figure
out the viability of orbital data centers. Operating data centers in
space will require overcoming several technical issues, including
managing temperatures for hardware, protecting that hardware from
radiation, and transferring data back to Earth without long lag times.
Skeptics say that space-based data centers won't be competitive on
cost. It may take tens of thousands of satellites to recreate the
compute capacity of a gigawatt data center in space. 

 META'S NEW AI SUPERSTARS ARE CHAFING AGAINST THE REST OF THE COMPANY
(9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 An us-versus-them mentality has emerged between Meta's top AI team
and Mark Zuckerberg's longtime lieutenants. TBD Lab's researchers have
come to view many Meta executives as interested only in improving the
social media business, while the lab's ambition is to create
superintelligence. Employees have disagreed over which division should
get more computing power. Those working on the social media ranking
algorithm have argued that more of the company's computing power
should be used to improve their business rather than to train AI
models.

 ‘GREETINGS, EARTHLINGS': NVIDIA-BACKED STARCLOUD TRAINS FIRST AI
MODEL IN SPACE AS ORBITAL DATA CENTER RACE HEATS UP (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Nvidia-backed startup Starcloud is running an artificial intelligence
model in space. The Washington-based company launched a satellite with
an Nvidia H100 graphics processing unit last month. It is now running
Google's Gemma large language model in orbit. Starcloud's satellite is
proof that space-based data centers can exist and operate a variety of
AI models. 

 NEURAL BALANCE INNOVATIONS TOOK CONTROL OF MY BODY AND CANCELED MY
MOTION SICKNESS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Neural Balance Innovations has developed a device that cancels motion
sickness in the body via Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation. It sends
electrical signals to the vestibular system, the part of the inner ear
that manages balance, so that it syncs up with what the eyes are
seeing. The Stimbox needs to be calibrated for every user, but after,
it can completely remove the sensation of motion sickness when using
VR devices. The device has the potential to give wearers a more
realistic virtual reality as it can simulate the feeling of falling.
It can be purchased now for 1,200€.

 FORRESTER STUDY: WHY 39% OF AI DEPLOYMENTS ARE FAILING TO DELIVER ROI
_(_SPONSOR) [9] 

 Most AI tools live in silos - ChatGPT for brainstorming, Claude for
writing, Notion for docs. According to new Forrester study [9], this
fragmentation is the top factor limiting returns for 39% of
organizations. The study surveyed 500+ decision makers and found that
the real AI opportunity isn't individual productivity, but better
collaboration. Download the free study. [9] 

 WHY WRITE ENGINEERING BLOGS? (19 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog collates several responses from tech bloggers on writing
for developers. The bloggers tell the story of why they started
blogging and why they continue to blog. The tech bloggers include
antirez, Eric Lippert, Phil Eaton, and Thorsten Ball. A link to the
full interview for each blogger is available. 

 SHOULD CSS BE CONSTRAINTS? (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 CSS is hard, and the rules can be quite complex. It is currently hard
to predict what CSS will result in. One commonly-proposed replacement
for CSS is a constraint system. However, with constraint-based
systems, it is possible to have more than or less than one layout that
satisfies the rules. Predictability suffers again once you have
complicated constraints and conflict handling rules.

 WHY AGI WILL NOT HAPPEN (24 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The thinking around AGI and superintelligence is fundamentally
flawed. A lot of the thinking is created in an echo chamber,
particularly in the Bay Area, where the same ideas amplify themselves
without critical awareness. This amplification of bad ideas is a big
problem in shaping a beneficial future for everyone. Realistic thought
should be used to shape a future that is good for everyone. 

 SILICON VALLEY IS RACING TO MAKE CRITICAL MINERALS—AND BLUNT
CHINA'S DOMINANCE (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 There is a nationwide push by startups to develop sources of raw
materials that the US desperately needs. Record levels of private
investment and advances in artificial intelligence are resulting in
new solutions to deal with China's crackdown on critical mineral
exports. Any success will soften China's edge in the industry. China
currently dominates the high-risk and low-margin mining and processing
of many of the minerals the US depends on to build everything from
smartphones to cars, jets, and satellites.
