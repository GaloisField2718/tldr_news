 OPENAI GPT-5 IS COMING EARLY NEXT MONTH (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI expects to release GPT-5 in August. GPT-5 is expected to
combine the attributes of both traditional models and so-called
reasoning models, such as o3, and be better at coding and more
powerful overall. The OpenAI model that recently achieved gold medal
performance in the International Mathematical Olympiad will not be
included in GPT-5. GPT-5 will be launched with mini and nano versions
and will be available through OpenAI's API. 

 GOOGLE ‘WEB GUIDE' LAB USES AI TO ORGANIZE THE SEARCH RESULTS PAGE
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's Web Guide feature is designed to better organize Search
results into categories with additional context and insights to make
it easier to find information and web pages. It uses a custom version
of Gemini that uses a query fan-out technique to perform multiple
related searches to identify the most relevant results. The feature is
ideal for both open-ended searches and detailed queries with multiple
sentences. Web Guide is available in Search Labs.

 COULD DOWN SYNDROME BE ELIMINATED? JAPANESE SCIENTISTS USE CRISPR TO
TARGET EXTRA CHROMOSOME (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Japanese researchers used CRISPR-Cas9 to remove an extra copy of
chromosome 21 from affected cells in a laboratory setting. The
scientific milestone could reshape future approaches to treating Down
syndrome. The CRISPR system targets the extra chromosome without
affecting the normal pair. If the technique proves safe and reliable,
it could be used in regenerative medicine. 

 ROBOTIC NECK INCISION REPLACES HEART VALVE WITH NO CHEST OPENING IN
WORLD FIRST (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic replaced heart valves through a small
neck incision using robotic assistance, avoiding the need to open the
chest. Four patients have so far undergone the procedure, called
transcervical robotic access for aortic valve replacement, and were
discharged within days, with one even resuming gym workouts just a
week after surgery. The procedure is being performed exclusively at
the Cleveland Clinic for now, but the team hopes to standardize it for
use at other highly specialized centers. It could redefine what is
possible for heart surgery.

 GOOGLE ANNOUNCES GOOGLE TRENDS API (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google has released an alpha version of its Google Trends API, which
is designed to help researchers, journalists, and developers
understand Search behaviors and patterns. Users will need to apply to
get access. Data on the API goes back five years, and it includes
daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly aggregations and geo restrictions.
A video of the Google Trends API announcement is available. 

 I WAS WRONG ABOUT HOW I SPEND MY CODING TIME (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cognitive biases affect how we perceive time. Your actual
productivity patterns, based on data, might actually surprise you.
This post discusses how to optimize coding time with action steps and
tools. Manual tracking often fails because it interrupts flow state -
the key is finding a method that works automatically without adding
friction to workflows.

 IF GLP-1 DRUGS ARE GOOD FOR EVERYTHING, SHOULD WE ALL BE ON THEM? (20
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Many studies seem to make GLP-1 therapies seem like holy water drawn
from the fountain of youth, but the reality is that the final verdict
on this medicine is still many years away. This article looks at
whether GLP-1 drugs are really as good as they seem, how the drugs
work, why they seem to be able to do everything, and whether everyone
should be taking them. While the development of these drugs is
exciting, the current side-effect profile isn't worth the risk for
otherwise healthy patients. 

 WHAT KIND OF WORK I WANT (IN 2025) (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sean Goedecke wrote a post describing the kind of work he wanted in
2021 - this is a follow-up post on the type of work he wants now.
Since 2021, the balance of power in tech has shifted away from
engineers and towards tech companies. The biggest change in Goedecke's
engineering values is that he no longer wants to work in a pure
maintenance role on existing legacy systems. Overall, his 2021 and
2025 statements of values are fairly similar, despite changing a lot
as an engineer over the years.
