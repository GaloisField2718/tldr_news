 CHATGPT AND GPT-4 COULD GET A SWEET UPGRADE THIS FALL (4 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 OpenAI is reportedly planning to launch a new AI as part of a chatbot
this fall. Codenamed Strawberry, the AI has advanced mathematical
reasoning, programming, and other skills that allow it to answer
questions on more subjective topics, like marketing strategies. It can
be used to generate high-quality synthetic training data for training
large language models. The model could help OpenAI obtain the data it
needs to train the GPT-4's successor. 

 ELON MUSK: CELLULAR STARLINK WILL OFFER FREE EMERGENCY SERVICE TO ALL
PHONES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SpaceX's Starlink system for mobile phones will be free for users
connecting to emergency services. The company is currently waiting for
approval from the Federal Communications Commission to let it
commercially operate its 'direct to cell' Starlink technology.
Providing free emergency services access would benefit public safety
communications and first responders. There aren't many details about
how Starlink's system will work, but it will likely be similar to
Apple's Emergency SOS feature for iPhones, which is free for the
iPhone 14 and up.

 SPACEX POLARIS LAUNCH POSTPONED AFTER HELIUM LEAK IS DETECTED (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission has been delayed until later this week
at the earliest due to a helium leak. The mission will send four
private citizens (billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, retired Air
Force Lt. Col. Scott ‚ÄúKidd‚Äù Poteet, and SpaceX engineers Sarah
Gillis and Anna Meno) to space on a mission that will include the
first spacewalk carried out by a civilian crew. It was scheduled to
lift off early Tuesday. Polaris Dawn is the first of three planned
space flights funded and organized by Isaacman and SpaceX. 

 COMPUTE MOONSHOTS: HARNESSING NEW PHYSICS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Digital computing is reaching relative maturity, with traditional
electronics well into the final phase of their S-curve and GPUs in the
middle of theirs. The demand for compute is showing no sign of
slowing. Next-gen approaches will need to harness entirely different
materials systems with more amenable physics. This article looks at
some of the possible technologies that may bring the industry to the
next level.

 VANILLA PRIME (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Vanilla Prime is a spiritual successor to VANILLA TODO with no
frameworks, no bundlers, and no required dependencies. It aims to
provide a simpler, more sustainable way of web development. While it
is less ergonomic than a fully integrated framework, it produces
websites that are performant, lightweight, independent, hackable (in a
good way), and respects users' and the world's resources. Vanilla
Prime can be difficult to get into and hard to master, but the
outcomes can be incredibly rewarding. 

 PREDICTING THE FUTURE OF DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS (21 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There are significant changes happening with distributed systems.
These changes will influence how systems are operated and how they are
programmed. This article shares insights into the changes in
transactional and analytical systems, especially around object storage
and programming models. There are many possible disruptive
technologies, so it is challenging to pick the winners and losers.

 THREE-QUARTERS OF FOUNDERS IN THE LATEST Y COMBINATOR COHORT ARE
WORKING ON AI STARTUPS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Of the 208 startups currently listed in Y Combinator's S24 startup
directory, 156 are working on AI-related products. Nearly half of all
US venture capital investment went to AI companies last quarter. It is
unclear whether Y Combinator is deliberately selecting startups that
are working in the space, if more founders are choosing to work in AI,
or if startups are just saying that their product is AI-related
because they think that's what investors or customers want to hear.
Only 33 Y Combinator startups were related to crypto and Web3 in 2022,
when the technology was the hottest thing to work on. 

 UBER WILL WIN SELF-DRIVING (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While Lyft has been working on innovative features for riders, Uber's
focus in the US has been on supply. With self-driving cars, the
platform power shift will be in the direction of who controls the
demand - most people who own self-driving cars will rent out their
cars to the platform that has the most demand for it. Uber will have
the most types of vehicles available and more flexibility in terms of
how much it can charge. It owns the most demand worldwide today, and
self-driving will make it even more dominant.

for new users to start out on the platform.
