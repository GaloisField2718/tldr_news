 GOOGLE WILL DEVELOP THE ANDROID OS FULLY IN PRIVATE, AND HERE'S WHY
(7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google is doing away with its current two-pronged Android development
strategy and instead shifting all development internally starting next
week. The company previously maintained a public branch and an
internal development branch, which resulted in Google spending a lot
of time and effort merging patches between the two branches. This
change doesn't mean that Google is becoming closed-source - the
company will continue to publish the source code for new Android
releases, but the frequency of public source code releases for
specific Android components will change. 

 OPENAI EXPECTS REVENUE WILL TRIPLE TO $12.7 BILLION THIS YEAR (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI plans to more than triple its revenue this year - it generated
$3.7 billion in annual revenue last year. The company hit 2 million
paid users for the corporate version of ChatGPT in September. It more
recently added a $200 monthly ChatGPT Pro option and is considering
charging thousands of dollars per month for certain AI products. The
company does not expect to be cash-flow positive until 2029. It has
been in talks with regulators to restructure into a for-profit public
benefit corporation.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 FIREFLY AEROSPACE SELECTS BLUE ORIGIN UNIT TO EXPLORE VOLCANIC
FORMATIONS ON MOON (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Firefly Aerospace has partnered with Blue Origin's Honeybee Robotics
for its third lunar mission in 2028. Honeybee will supply a rover to
study the Gruithuisen Domes, unusual volcanic formations located in
the Moon's near side believed to be rich in silica. Studying the
formations could unlock clues about the Moon's geological history and
potential resources for future human missions. The upcoming mission is
part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative. 

 UPCOMING PRIVATE SPACEX MISSION WILL BOLDLY GO WHERE NO HUMAN HAS
ORBITED BEFORE (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Fram2 mission will launch four private astronauts into polar
orbit to observe Earth's polar regions at an altitude of around 265 to
280 miles above the ground. It is set for launch on board a SpaceX
Falcon 9 rocket no earlier than Monday, March 31 at 11:20 PM ET. The
four-person crew will be led by Chun Wang of Malta, who founded
Bitcoin mining companies f2pool and stakefish. The astronauts will
spend three to five days on board SpaceX's Dragon crew spacecraft as
they study an aurora-like phenomenon known as STEVE (Strong Thermal
Emission Velocity Enhancement), known for its hazy purple and green
streaks across the sky. The mission will also include an attempt to
grow mushrooms in space.

 MCP 🤝 OPENAI AGENTS SDK (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Model context protocol (MCP) is a way to provide tools and
context to a large language model. It is an open protocol that
provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data
sources and tools. OpenAI's Agents SDK now has support for MCP,
enabling developers to use a wide range of MCP servers to provide
tools to Agents. The company is still working on MCP support for the
OpenAI API and ChatGPT desktop app. 

 A LOVE LETTER TO THE CSV FORMAT (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 CSV is often criticized for the wrong reasons. It has many strengths
- CSV is dead simple, open and free, text-based, streamable, can be
appended to, and succinct. It is dynamically typed, letting developers
parse values as they see fit. Reverse CSV is still valid CSV, which
means the last rows of a CSV file can be read very efficiently and
easily - just feed the bytes of the file in reverse order to a CSV
parser. Excel hates CSV, which clearly means CSV must be doing
something right.

 HAS THE DECLINE OF KNOWLEDGE WORK BEGUN? (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The unemployment rate for college graduates has risen 30% since
bottoming out in September 2022. Hiring rates have slowed more for
jobs that require a college degree than for other jobs. Some
economists say that these trends may be short-term in nature and
little cause for concern on their own, but there are other signs that
the returns on a college degree may have shifted over a longer period
- the gap in wages between those with college degrees and those
without has flattened during the past 15 years, though it remains
large. The flattening of the gap may reflect employers' reduced need
for college graduates. 

 THE VIBE SHIFT AMONGST APPLE DEVELOPERS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple's AI product offerings are non-competitive. Software
development is moving faster than ever before, and Apple looks like it
is increasingly likely to miss out on a generation of developers
conditioned on tools like Cursor, Replit, or v0. The company's AI
tools remain notably absent. AI may change the equation enough for
Apple to shift its stance, but that could take years. Apple could
change all of this with web distribution, but that would be very risky
for the company.

 THE ROLE OF DEVELOPER SKILLS IN AGENTIC CODING (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While advancements in AI have been impressive, these tools are still
far away from writing code autonomously for non-trivial tasks - this
post looks at the types of skills that developers will still have to
apply for the foreseeable future.
