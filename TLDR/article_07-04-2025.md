 TRUMP'S TIKTOK PLAN UPENDED BY CHINESE OBJECTIONS OVER TARIFFS (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 China has withheld approval for a deal that involved the launch of a
new US-based version of TikTok owned and operated by a majority of
American investors. White House officials had planned for President
Trump to sign an executive order approving the proposal, which had the
blessings of investors and ByteDance. Trump's recent tariffs have
angered China and prompted retaliatory measures against the US. The
deadline to reach a deal has been extended by another 75 days. 

 META INTRODUCES LLAMA 4 WITH TWO NEW AI MODELS AVAILABLE NOW, AND TWO
MORE ON THE WAY (2 MINUTE READ) [6]

to download now from the Llama website and Hugging Face and have been
added to Meta AI. Behemoth is an upcoming model that Meta claims is
among the world's smartest large language models. More information
about Llama 4 Reasoning will be released in the next month.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THIS BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE IS NOW A TWO-WAY STREET (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Scientists at Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research have
developed a technology that allows brain-computer interfaces to
provide touch feedback to users. The technology was implanted into a
patient who was paralyzed from the chest down after a driving
accident. It allowed the patient not only to control movements in his
hand but also to receive touch feedback and 'feel', using those
sensations to guide movements. The patient was able to pick up a cup
and drink from it just by thinking about performing the task and pick
up an empty eggshell without cracking it. 

 THE FIRST PEOPLE TO FLY IN SPACE OVER THE POLES GOT THIS STUNNING
VIEW (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Chun Wang, Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, and Eric Philips were the
first people to fly over Earth's poles in space. The private mission
launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on a Falcon 9 rocket on
March 31. While these were the first people to make the journey,
low-Earth polar orbits are commonly used for weather-tracking and spy
satellites. Photos and video from the mission are available in the
article.

 SPARKS (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Sparks is a typeface for creating sparklines in text without code. It
uses OpenType's contextual alternates feature to perform simple
replacement operations on numbers. Sparks works on desktop and on the
web without JavaScript (but it requires a browser that can make use of
OpenType features in text). It is currently compatible with Microsoft
Word 2010 and later, Apple Pages, Adobe Creative Cloud applications,
Chrome 33+, Safari 6+, Firefox 4+, and Internet Explorer 10+. 

 THE CURVE IS BENDING (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Model output is now actually worth more than the cost of real dev
work. It's starting to make sense to throw a lot of money towards
inference. This will probably cause some disruption in the junior dev
job market - or at least disrupt what it means to be a junior dev.
Code-writing agents are predicted to essentially match college
graduates in almost all software tasks by the end of 2026.

 OPENAI SAYS IT'LL RELEASE O3 AFTER ALL, DELAYS GPT-5 (2 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 OpenAI plans to release both o3 and o4-mini in a couple of weeks. The
company had previously canceled the launch of its o3 reasoning model
but reversed course due to its upcoming GPT-5 model. GPT-5 will now
roll out later than originally anticipated as the company prepares
enough capacity to support what it expects to be unprecedented demand.
The model will incorporate voice, Canvas, search, deep research, and
more.
