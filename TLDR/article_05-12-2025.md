 A FENTANYL VACCINE IS ABOUT TO GET ITS FIRST MAJOR TEST (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 ARMR Sciences is launching a trial to test its fentanyl vaccine in
people for the first time. The vaccine is designed to be given to
people before they use the drug. It neutralizes fentanyl in the
bloodstream before it reaches the brain, preventing the respiratory
failure that comes with overdose, as well as the euphoric high people
get when taking the drug. ARMR is testing an injectable vaccine in the
upcoming trial, but it is also looking into an oral formulation
similar to a Listerine strip for future trials.

 WHY I IGNORE THE SPOTLIGHT AS A STAFF ENGINEER (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 You don't have to chase the spotlight to have a meaningful,
high-impact career at a big company. The tech industry loves to tell
you to move fast, but there is a path where leverage comes from depth,
patience, and the quiet satisfaction of building the foundation others
stand on. It's okay to stay put, dig in, and build something that
lasts. Some projects require engineers to sit with a problem space for
years until they understand it well enough.

 TESLA CEO ELON MUSK ANNOUNCES MAJOR UPDATE WITH TEXTING AND DRIVING
ON FSD (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Tesla says it will allow people to text and drive while using
Full-Self Driving (FSD) within the next couple of months. There are
some concerns with the capability, as laws in the US specifically
prohibit texting and driving. Some states prohibit drivers from even
holding a phone when the car is in motion. Elon Musk has noted that
the capability will only be available depending on the context of
surrounding traffic, but did not provide any details about what
conditions FSD would allow a driver to text and drive.
