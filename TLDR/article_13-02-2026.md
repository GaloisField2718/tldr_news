 THE FASTEST GROWING AI COMPANIES CHOOSE WORKOS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI companies are scaling faster than ever and hitting enterprise
requirements far earlier in their lifecycle.

SSO, SCIM, RBAC, audit logs, compliance. These are non-negotiable for
enterprise customers, and expensive and difficult to build and
maintain in-house.

That's why OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Vercel, and more use WorkOS [4]
to power authentication, identity, and security. It's the
infrastructure layer that makes applications enterprise ready without
slowing teams down.

 ANTHROPIC CLOSES $30 BILLION FUNDING ROUND AS CASH KEEPS FLOWING INTO
TOP AI STARTUPS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic has closed a $30 billion funding round at a $380 billion
post-money valuation. This is the second-largest private tech
fundraising round on record after OpenAI, which closed a round of more
than $40 billion last year. Anthropic's funding round was led by
Coatue and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. The fresh capital will
support the company's infrastructure expansion, research, and
continued investment in enterprise-grade products. 

 WAYMO BEGINS DEPLOYING NEXT-GEN OJAI ROBOTAXIS TO EXTEND ITS US LEAD
(6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Waymo has begun using its sixth-generation driverless system to
provide robotaxi rides to employees. The system uses more
cost-effective parts and should be able to navigate through harsher
weather conditions than previous generations. It will serve as the
primary engine for Waymo's next era of expansion. The company is
currently planning to extend its lead in the US while testing and
planning for commercial operations abroad.

 WHEN AMAZON BADLY NEEDED A RIDE, EUROPE'S ARIANE 6 ROCKET DELIVERED
(6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Europe's Ariane 6 rocket lifted off from the Guiana Space Center in
South America at 11:45 AM EST on Thursday. The rocket's four boosters
generated more than 3.4 million pounds of thrust as it hauled 32
spacecraft to low-Earth orbit for Amazon's satellite broadband
constellation. The successful test demonstrates the European Space
Agency's ability to deliver the most demanding large-scale
constellation missions. The next Ariane 6 launch, to be announced in
the coming weeks, will carry another set of Amazon Leo satellites to
orbit. 

 GOOGLE SAYS DEEP THINK AI CAN PARTNER ON ADVANCED MATH, SCIENCE (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Alphabet has updated its Gemini Deep Think AI model for better
performance in math and science research. The model is now able to
help scientists move from theoretical reasoning to practical
applications. It uses Google Search to avoid inaccuracies and wrongful
citations when doing research. Google has also developed a math
research agent called Aletheia that can conduct autonomous research or
collaborate with humans. Aletheia is available in the Gemini app for
Google AI Ultra subscribers and also for select researchers.

 INTRODUCING GPT‑5.3‑CODEX‑SPARK (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 GPT‑5.3‑Codex‑Spark is a smaller version of GPT‑5.3‑Codex
designed for real-time coding. It is now available as a research
preview to ChatGPT Pro users. The model has a 128k context window. It
is text only, and during the research preview, the model will have its
own rate limits and usage will not count towards standard rate limits.
There may be limited access or temporary queuing when demand is high. 

 IN DEFENSE OF NOT READING THE CODE (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Not reading the code is a bet on the trajectory. The tools may not be
perfect, but they're good enough for many use cases, and they're
improving incredibly quickly. The bet is that models will continue to
improve. People shouldn't be reckless, but code will soon become an
implementation detail, and directly interacting with it will not be
how engineers make sure it is correct.

 CONTEXT IS KING (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Both code and databases are commoditizing. The layer between them is
where the new value forms. This is the context layer, the thing that
makes the difference between an agent that takes action and an agent
that takes the right action. The battle for this layer is the most
important strategic competition in enterprise software. 

 AN AI AGENT PUBLISHED A HIT PIECE ON ME (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 An AI agent of unknown ownership autonomously wrote and published a
personalized hit piece about an engineer after they rejected its code.
The agent's behavior was likely entirely autonomous, with no human
telling the AI what to do. While the threat was ineffective, the
reputational attack could be effective today against the right person.
As AI improves, this could be a serious threat to the social order.
