 AFTER YEARS OF RESEARCH, AN APPLE SMART RING MAY BE IMMINENT (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is supposedly getting very close to launching its rumored ring
wearable. The company has consistently released smart ring-related
patents for several years. A patent from November details a system
that lets users control their smartphones and other devices through
the use of an external band on the ring. The idea of an Apple smart
ring started from rumors in 2007. While the company is apparently
considering a launch date for the device, it hasn't indicated how
close the launch date will be. 

 MUSK CLAIMS NEURALINK PATIENT DOING OK WITH IMPLANT, CAN MOVE MOUSE
WITH BRAIN (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk says that the first human to be implanted with Neuralink's
brain chip has made a full recovery with no ill effects. The patient
is reportedly able to move a mouse around a computer screen by just
thinking. Neuralink is working on getting as many button presses on
the mouse as possible from thinking. The company has been criticized
for releasing information through Musk as he has a huge financial
stake in the outcome.

 MIND-READING DEVICES ARE REVEALING THE BRAIN‚ÄôS SECRETS (15 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has
allowed scientists to learn lessons about the brain that are
overturning assumptions about brain anatomy. BCIs allow scientists to
record single-neuron activity for a lot of brain areas that were
previously not accessible. They also allow for longer measurements
compared to classical tools. Advances in artificial intelligence,
decoding tools, and hardware have propelled the field forward. This
article discusses some of the findings that BCI technology has
enabled. 

 ZUCKERBERG: NEURAL WRISTBAND FOR AR/VR INPUT WILL SHIP "IN THE NEXT
FEW YEARS" (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mark Zuckerberg says that Meta's finger-tracking neural wristband
will ship as a product in the next few years. The wristband uses a
technique called electromyography to sense the neural electrical
signals passing through users' wrists, potentially providing zero or
even negative latency and perfect accuracy, even in poor lighting
conditions. The device could enable low-effort precise manipulation in
any scenario, similar to a computer mouse but more versatile and with
an extra dimension. Videos of the device are available in the article.

 FALSEHOODS JUNIOR DEVELOPERS BELIEVE ABOUT BECOMING SENIOR (12 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Senior developers seem like people who can solve all the problems and
know all the answers. It's easy to believe the fantasy that climbing
the ranks will somehow result in knowledge, authority, and ease. The
reality is much more grounded and rewarding. Advancing in a career is
about embracing new sets of complex and nuanced responsibilities. This
article looks at falsehoods that junior developers believe about
senior developers, showing readers what it really means to be a senior
developer.

 SORA, GROQ, AND VIRTUAL REALITY (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Vision Pro and OpenAI's Sora launched in the same month. At the
same time, Groq is showing that real-time inferencing may be more
attainable than previously thought. TSMC is pushing to 2nm chips and
Intel is making a credible bid to join them. While we are not yet at
an iPhone moment when it comes to virtual reality, a lot of the pieces
are now in sight. The technology still needs a lot more work, but the
path from here is almost clear.
