 BUILDING IN THE AGE OF AI: STARTUP LESSONS FOR EARLY-STAGE GROWTH
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 In an era where AI is reshaping how businesses operate, the journey
of building an early-stage startup [4] has never been more
dynamic—or complex. How do founders navigate finding product-market
fit, delegation, and scaling, all while adapting to technological
innovations?

Join on January 14 at 3 pm PT [4]for a fireside chat with Christina
Cacioppo, CEO and Co-founder of Vanta, and Eric Ries, author of The
Lean Startup and Founder of LTSE, as they explore the journey of the
modern startup founder.

Eric and Christina will discuss:

 	* Learnings from their own experiences
 	* How the principles of “founder mode” and lean methodology
intersect
 	* The ways that today's AI-driven landscape shapes early-stage
growth and startup success

 IOS 18.3 HINTS AT NEW ‘INVITES' APP FROM APPLE TO CREATE AND MANAGE
EVENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 References to an 'Apple Invites' app were first found in one of the
iOS 18.2 betas. They were removed from the final version, but they are
now back in iOS 18.3 beta 2. The app is likely designed to help users
organize meetings and in-person events. It will essentially show a
list of people invited to an event and who has already confirmed
attendance. It is unclear whether Invites will be a standalone app or
if Apple will integrate it with other parts of its system. 

 NVIDIA MAY ENTER THE ARM CPU MARKET AFTER ALL (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has hinted at broader ambitions for the
Arm-based CPU within the GB10 Grace Blackwell chip. MediaTek, the
chip's co-developer, also has its own aspirations. Huang recently
introduced Nvidia's Project Digits at CES 2025. The cutting-edge
$3,000 desktop AI supercomputer delivers an impressive 1 petaFLOPS of
FP4 floating-point performance, making it a powerful tool for running
AI models and workloads for home enthusiasts and researchers.

 NASA HAS JUST TWO MARS SAMPLE RETURN MISSION LANDER OPTIONS LEFT (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NASA will need until 2026 before making a final decision on how the
Mars Sample Return mission will work. The space agency has whittled
the options to two: use the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which
would employ the sky crane technology to deposit a lander on the
surface of the red planet, or use a commercial vendor to get a lander
to Mars. The plan relies on the Perseverance trundlebot being able to
make it to the lander. The JPL option would cost between $6.6 billion
and $7.7 billion, while the commercial providers may cost between $5.8
billion and $7.1 billion. NASA has not provided details on what the
commercial vendors suggested due to proprietary information concerns. 

 CHINESE RISC-V PROJECT TEASES 2025 DEBUT OF FREELY LICENSED ADVANCED
CHIP DESIGN (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Institute of Computing Technology at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences' Xiangshan project aims to use the permissively licensed
RISC-V ISA to create a high-performance chip. It has published the
designs of its third-generation chip called Kunminghu, a 64-bit RISC-V
architecture that supports multiple parallel processing units capable
of integer, floating-point, and vector operations. The designs will be
available under a royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable copyright
license to reproduce, use, modify, or distribute.

 STAGEHAND (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Stagehand is a tool for building browser automations. It offers three
simple AI APIs to provide the building blocks for web automation via
natural language. Stagehand is fully compatible with Playwright - it
makes Playwright more accessible to non-technical users and less
vulnerable to minor changes in the UI/DOM. Anything that can be done
in a browser can be done with Stagehand. 

 DOUBLE-KEYED CACHING: HOW BROWSER CACHE PARTITIONING CHANGED THE WEB
(12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The web's caching model recently underwent a fundamental shift that
challenges many performance optimization assumptions. Browsers
traditionally maintained a simple key-value store for cached
resources. While efficient, this model leaked information. With the
new model, double-keyed caching, browsers use two pieces of
information: the top-level site making the request and the resource's
URL. It caches identical resources separately for each site that
requests them, effectively partitioning the cache and preventing
cross-site tracking and other privacy issues - a trade-off between
security and efficiency.

 STACKOVERFLOW DEC 2024 STATS (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 StackOverflow received 87,105 new questions in March 2023. This
number was reduced to 58,792 by March 2024, and by December it was
25,566. The site is becoming more outdated and questions are being
closed more than ever before. StackOverflow was already in decline
before ChatGPT's launch. It was just so big that it took years to
topple to the ground. 

 CES 2025: ALL THE NEWS, GADGETS, AND SURPRISES (WEBSITE) [12] 

 CES has so far been a big show for laptops, gaming, TVs, and smart
home tech. This year has had a focus on some trendier emerging
categories like AI and AR. This page contains a collection of articles
that cover all the news from the event. Some of the highlights from
the event include the Razer gaming chair, which heats and cools; a
robotic vacuum with arms and legs; Nvidia's Digits supercomputer; and
Mirumi, a shy sloth-like robot.
