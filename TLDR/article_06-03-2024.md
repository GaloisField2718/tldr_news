 OPENAI AND ELON MUSK (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has released a statement detailing its mission and facts about
the company's relationship with Elon Musk. The company plans to
dismiss all of the claims from Musk's recent lawsuit. OpenAI partnered
with Microsoft as it realized that it needed a lot more capital to
succeed at its mission of achieving Artificial General Intelligence.
It continues to advance its mission by building widely-available
beneficial tools. OpenAI's statement includes an email exchange
between Musk and OpenAI regarding funding. 

 IOS 17.4 IS HERE AND READY FOR A WHOLE NEW EUROPE (4 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Apple's iOS 17.4 update introduces new emojis, a cryptographic
security protocol for iMessage, major changes to the App Store and
contactless payments for the iPhone platform in Europe, the ability
for users to download alternative browser engines, and auto-generated
audio transcripts in the Podcasts app. Third-party developers will be
allowed to offer alternative marketplaces and app downloads to EU
users from outside the iOS App Store. While Apple was previously
planning to drop support for progressive web apps, it now says it will
continue to offer existing capabilities using WebKit technology, with
no option for them to be powered by third-party browser engines.

 DELL EXEC REVEALS NVIDIA HAS A 1,000-WATT GPU IN THE WORKS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Nvidia's B200 AI accelerator will consume 1,000 watts without
requiring liquid cooling. The chip isn't expected to launch until late
2024. Nvidia plans to launch its H200 GPUs in the next few months. The
company claims the H200 can double the performance of large language
models thanks to its HBM3e memory stacks, which provide 4.8TB/second
of bandwidth. 

 I WORKED EXCLUSIVELY IN VISION PRO FOR A WEEK ‚Äî HERE‚ÄôS HOW IT
WENT (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Apple Vision Pro's $3,500 price tag would be much easier to
justify if it managed to replace multiple devices at once, just like
the iPhone did when it first arrived. It is possible to get serious
work done while wearing the Vision Pro - if you can work on an iPad,
you can work on a Vision Pro. However, it can't replace a Mac for
everyone due to lacking some heavy-duty applications. One big downside
is the lack of a practical way to use the Vision Pro in meetings.

1 framework, all of the concepts, abstractions, and principles
discussed in the article still apply to TextKit 2, either unchanged or
under a better API. The article covers the TextView class, syntax
highlighting, styling, typing, performance, sharing, and much more. 

 TRAINING GREAT LLMS ENTIRELY FROM GROUND ZERO IN THE WILDERNESS AS A
STARTUP (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Training AI models requires compute, but there's a large amount of
instability and huge variance in the quality of clusters,
accelerators, and connectivity in compute providers. This article
discusses the differences between training models at Google and
training models 'in the wild' - outside of Google, where data
scientists have to use GPUs instead of Google's TPUs. It makes
comparisons between Google's infrastructure and tools to their
equivalents in the outside world. With the right amount of brute
technical strength, it is possible to train models from scratch that
match Gemini Pro/GPT 3.5.

recently hit the 3% milestone in June last year. Windows has seen an
increase in usage, but macOS has seen a drop in its market share,
despite its global computer market share going up in the same period.
Windows and macOS represent 87.59% of desktop OSes. 

 BITCOIN ROCKETS TO AN ALL-TIME HIGH ABOVE $69,000, SURPASSING 2021
RECORD (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high for the first time in more
than two years. It surpassed $69,000 before retreating - the previous
record was $68,982.20 on November 10, 2021. The current rally is
fueled by excitement over bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming halving event.
While investors are cautious about a possible correction, there are
still longer-term catalysts supporting the positive price action.
