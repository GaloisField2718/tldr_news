 NASA ROVER MAKES A SHOCKING DISCOVERY: LIGHTNING ON MARS (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Scientists have observed centimeter-scale electrical discharges on
Mars. The sparks could play an important role in chemical reactions in
the Martian atmosphere. They do not pose any danger of electrocution
for humans. However, they could disrupt or damage electronic devices
over time. Lightning has also previously been observed in the
atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. 

 STUDY CLAIMS TO PROVIDE FIRST DIRECT EVIDENCE OF DARK MATTER (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The first evidence of dark matter may have been discovered.
Scientists have spotted a pattern of gamma rays that appears to match
the shape of the dark matter halo that spreads out in a sphere from
the heart of the galaxy. It closely matches the properties of
gamma-ray radiation predicted to be emitted by dark matter. More work
is needed to rule out other astrophysical processes and background
emissions that could explain the signals.

 TECHNICAL DEFLATION (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Anything you build now will get easier in six months. If the building
part is easy, then your moat has to be something else. Focus more on
selling and less on building. Understanding your customer and their
problems better than anyone else is a real advantage that doesn't go
away. 

 RUNPROMPT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 runprompt is a single-file Python script for running .prompt files.
.prompt is an executable GenAI prompt template file format designed to
be agnostic to programming language and model provider. It allows for
maximum flexibility in usage. The format streamlines the process of
working with AI models and ensuring consistency across different uses
of the same prompt.

 THE MATH OF WHY YOU CAN'T FOCUS AT WORK (37 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Deep work is unlikely unless you deliberately design for it. Your
default state is fragmentation - you are not uniquely undisciplined.
Dropping just one interruption per hour per day can have a huge
effect. Cutting down tasks into smaller chunks can mean the difference
between a hellish day and a passable one. 

 MORE ARTICLES ARE NOW CREATED BY AI THAN HUMANS (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The quantity of AI-generated articles has surpassed the quantity of
human-written articles being published on the web. Despite the
prevalence of AI-generated articles, they largely do not appear in
Google and ChatGPT. The proportion of AI-generated articles has
remained relatively stable over the last 12 months. This is likely
because practitioners found that AI-generated articles do not perform
well in search.
