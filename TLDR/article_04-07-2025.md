 APPLE LOOKED INTO BUILDING ITS OWN AWS COMPETITOR (3 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Apple's Project ACDC (Apple Chips in Data Centers) would have
provided developer cloud services running on Apple's own chips. Apple
executives believed that Apple silicon could offer better AI inference
performance at a lower cost. It already uses its own chips inside its
data centers for Private Cloud Compute, Siri, and services like Photos
and Apple Music. The status of the project is unclear as the executive
who championed the idea left the company in 2023. 

 ILYA SUTSKEVER BECOMES CEO OF SAFE SUPERINTELLIGENCE AFTER META
POACHED DANIEL GROSS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever will assume the CEO role at Safe
Superintelligence, the artificial intelligence startup he launched
last year, as the previous CEO, Daniel Gross, was poached by Meta.
Safe Superintelligence co-founder Danielle Levy will now serve as
president. The company's technical team will continue to report to
Sutskever. Sutskever plans to keep running the company as an
independent organization.

 RECORD-BREAKING RESULTS BRING FUSION POWER CLOSER TO REALITY (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Germany's Wendelstein 7-X, an advanced fusion reactor, set a record
last May by magnetically 'bottling up' superheated plasma for 43
seconds. The large Joint European Torus (JET) fusion reactor near
Oxford, England, achieved even longer containment times of up to 60
seconds in final experiments before its retirement in December 2023.
These results, among other recent advances in the field, are bringing
fusion power closer and closer to reality. This article presents an
overview of the current field of fusion to show how the elusive dream
of controlled nuclear fusion may soon be within reach. 

 SCIENTISTS SPOT MYSTERY OBJECT BELIEVED TO COME FROM BEYOND SOLAR
SYSTEM (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Astronomers have discovered a new object hurtling through the solar
system. Known as 3I/Atlas, the object is about 416 million miles away
from the Sun and believed to be traveling at about 37 miles per second
relative to the Sun. If confirmed, it will provide more evidence that
such interstellar wanderers are relatively common in our galaxy. The
comet poses no threat to Earth. It will reach its closest approach to
the Sun - within about 130 million miles - around October 30.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 INTRODUCING TMUX-RS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This developer ported tmux to Rust - they recently reached the
milestone of having the code base being 100% unsafe Rust. This post
discusses the process of porting the original code base from around
67,000 lines of C code to around 81,000 lines of Rust, excluding
comments and empty lines. The post covers interesting bugs, C patterns
in Rust, development tools, and more. The developer's next goal is to
convert the code base to safe Rust. 

 CACHING IS AN ABSTRACTION, NOT AN OPTIMIZATION (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Caching is best understood as a tool for making software simpler
rather than as a tool to improve performance. It resembles an
abstraction rather than an optimization. Understanding this makes it
possible to come up with designs that work and satisfy the functional
requirements of systems from the perspective of 'having adequate, fast
access to the data it needs'. The problem should be figuring out how
to get data into fast storage as often as possible instead of gaming a
system that is holding data access storage.

 SAMSUNG SEEMS TO HAVE LEAKED ITS OWN TRIFOLD PHONE DESIGN (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Samsung's latest One UI 8 build update contains animations that show
what the trifold Samsung flagship might look like. While it is labeled
the ' Multifold 7' in the files, the device is speculated to be called
the 'Galaxy G Fold'. The animations reveal how the device will likely
fold - there are two differently sized hinges, with the left-hand
display folding inward, suggesting the right-hand display is designed
to sandwich over the top. Samsung is expected to reveal the latest
generation of its Z Fold and Z Flip devices at its next Unpacked event
on July 9. 

 TESLA OPTIMUS IS IN SHAMBLES AS HEAD OF PROGRAM EXITS, PRODUCTION
DELAYED (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Tesla's humanoid robot program is reportedly in disarray due to the
departure of the senior vice-president in charge. Production has been
delayed due to a new redesign. The robot has yet to prove useful in
Tesla's factories. Elon Musk's goal for Tesla to produce 5,000 to
10,000 Optimus humanoid robots this year has been delayed - Tesla has
informed suppliers of a two-month halt on orders. The company is
likely to unveil a new generation of Optimus robots at its
shareholders' meeting this year.
