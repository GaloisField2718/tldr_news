 APPLE'S FOLDABLE IPAD COULD BE LIKE ‘TWO IPAD PROS SIDE-BY-SIDE' (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple hopes to release a foldable 18.8-inch creaseless iPad by about
2028. Its industrial design group has reportedly managed to create
prototypes of the device. It is unknown whether the device will be
able to run Mac apps, but rumors say that iPadOS should be advanced
enough to run macOS apps by 2028. A foldable iPhone is still
apparently in the works. 

 HOW CLAUDE BECAME TECH INSIDERS' CHATBOT OF CHOICE (7 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Claude has become the chatbot of choice for a crowd of savvy tech
insiders. These people claim Claude provides more human-sounding
answers and that it is helping them with things such as legal advice,
health coaching, and therapy. Claude apparently seems more insightful
and good at helping people spot patterns and blind spots. It is
roughly comparable to the most powerful models from OpenAI, Google,
and others on benchmark evaluations, but its fans say its emotional
intelligence sets it apart.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 THE $20-TRILLION TUNNEL THAT COULD LINK NEW YORK AND LONDON (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A transatlantic tunnel connecting the UK to the US may be possible,
but it would be extremely expensive, with estimates of almost $20
trillion for the project. It would take many years for the 3,000-mile
tunnel to be completed - it took six years to build the 23.5-mile
Channel Tunnel linking England and France. Developments in vacuum tube
technology have made the concept more viable. A vehicle traveling in a
hyperloop system could theoretically reach speeds of more than 3,000
mph, making the journey between London and New York barely an hour
long. 

 A ‘SECOND TREE OF LIFE' COULD WREAK HAVOC, SCIENTISTS WARN (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists will be able to create a microbe that could cause an
unstoppable pandemic within a few decades. 38 prominent biologists
have issued a warning and called for a ban on research that could lead
to the synthesis of such an organism. The molecules that serve as the
building blocks of DNA and proteins typically exist in one of two
mirror-image forms, but living cells rely on just one form. A
'mirrored' cell would have proteins that are much harder to break down
as natural enzymes are targeted at un-mirrored proteins. Scientists
have already created mirror proteins and are experimenting with them
to create longer-acting drugs. Creating mirror cells would mean
creating a second tree of life.

 REFLECTIONS ON BUILDING WITH MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (MCP) (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed by
Anthropic for connecting large language models with external tools and
data. It lets AI apps connect to local and remote servers that provide
access to tools and resources like databases, search engines, and
other APIs. MCP provides SDKs in Python and TypeScript. This article
reviews the protocol and provides suggestions on how it can be
improved. 

 A HIGH-VELOCITY STYLE OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (25 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Write code not documents. Focus and express ideas in code and execute
them often. Test ideas, play with variations of them, and make code
easy to handle, read, mix, and match. Make errors and failures cheap.
All things should move smoothly and tools should be accessible. This
allows developers to stay busy all the time with no useless
interruptions.

 WHAT IS VENTURE CAPITAL NOW ANYWAY? (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Benchmark Capital started small and aimed to stay small. Andreessen
Horowitz (a16z) set up shop to do the opposite - raise more money, do
more deals, make more noise, and flash more attitude. Over the years,
a16z's assets have grown to $44 billion. The gaps between the two
firms highlights the divergence in the venture capital industry. This
article looks at how the two firms have performed over the years and
the implications for the venture capital industry. 

 META URGES CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL TO STOP OPENAI FROM BECOMING
FOR-PROFIT (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Meta is urging California's attorney general to block OpenAI's
planned conversion to a for-profit company. It says that allowing
OpenAI to become a for-profit company would set a dangerous precedent
of allowing startups to enjoy the advantages of nonprofit status until
they are poised to become profitable. OpenAI's conduct could have
serious implications for Silicon Valley if its business model is
proven valid.
