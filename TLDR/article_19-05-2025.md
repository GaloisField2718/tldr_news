 🚀 FASTER MOBILE APP RELEASES WITH 100% PARALLEL AUTOMATED QA
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf [5] gets mobile apps to 80% automated test coverage in weeks
[6]. They create and maintain your test suite in Appium (no vendor
lock-in) — and provide unlimited, 100% parallel test runs [7] with
zero flakes.

✅ QA cycles reduced from hours to less than 15 minutes

✅ Tests run on REAL IOS DEVICES and ANDROID EMULATORS

✅ Flake-free runs, no false positives

✅ Human-verified bug reports

No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No more bugs
reaching production.

 WHY APPLE STILL HASN'T CRACKED AI (35 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While Apple has rolled out new AI features just like its competitors,
they've mostly been notable for being delayed and underwhelming. The
company announced Apple Intelligence last June, but some of the
features are still being delayed - the new Siri won't be out in time
for next month's WWDC, a year after it was first announced. Apple has
devoted considerable resources to the technology and has little to
show for it. While some attribute the struggles to decisions made by
executives, others see symptoms of a deeper problem within the
company. 

 OPENAI INTRODUCES CODEX, ITS FIRST FULL-FLEDGED AI AGENT FOR CODING
(2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's Codex is an agentic coding tool that allows experienced
developers to delegate rote and relatively simple programming tasks to
an AI agent to generate production-ready code. It is a unique
interface that can be accessed from the sidebar in the ChatGPT web
app. Developers can include an 'AGENTS.md' file to give the agent
custom instructions. Codex is built on a fine-tuned variation of
OpenAI's o3 reasoning model. It is now rolling out to ChatGPT Pro,
Enterprise, and Team users - Plus and Edu support will come at a later
date.

 LASER-POWERED FUSION EXPERIMENT MORE THAN DOUBLES ITS POWER OUTPUT (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The team at the US Department of Energy's National Ignition Facility
has increased the yield of its net-positive fusion experiment to 8.6
megajoules. They made history in 2022 when they generated 3.15
megajoules in the first controlled fusion reaction to generate more
energy than it consumed. While none of the experiments have been
effective enough to feed electrons back to the grid, they show that
controlled nuclear fusion is more than hypothetical. 

 FDA OKS FIRST BLOOD TEST THAT CAN HELP DIAGNOSE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
(2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A blood test has been approved by US health officials for diagnosing
Alzheimer's in patients 55 and older who are showing early signs of
the disease. The test identifies a key marker for Alzheimer's,
beta-amyloid. The low costs and convenience of the blood test may help
expand the use of drugs shown to slightly slow the progression of the
disease. Previously, the only FDA-approved methods for detecting
beta-amyloid were invasive tests of spinal fluid or expensive PET
scans.

 GOOGLE IS ABOUT TO UNLEASH GEMINI NANO'S POWER FOR THIRD-PARTY
ANDROID APPS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google's new ML Kit GenAI APIs, likely to be announced at I/O 2025,
will enable developers to implement AI features like text
summarization into their apps. The APIs will support image input and
be available on a wide range of Android devices beyond the Pixel 9
series. They will enable on-device execution of AI foundation models
like Gemini Nano to enhance app functionality, keeping user data
private by processing data locally. 

 HOW TO HAVE THE BROWSER PICK A CONTRASTING COLOR IN CSS (17 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 CSS' contrast-color() allows the browser to automatically assign
contrasting color values. This can be handy, especially in large
projects, as managing such small details can be a really hard task to
get right. Developers just need to define one color. This post
provides a guide on how to use contrast-color() and discusses
accessibility considerations when using the function.

 Google I/O is scheduled for May 20 to 21 at the Shoreline
Amphitheater in Mountain View. The developer conference will showcase

Android, Chrome, Search, YouTube, and Gemini. It will likely reveal
more about Android 16 and spotlight the capabilities in the latest
versions of Android XR and Wear OS. Leaks over the past few weeks
suggest that an updated Gemini Ultra model is on the way, which may
indicate a pricier Gemini subscription. 

 APPLE SAYS IT WON'T YET ‘TAKE ACTION' ON FORTNITE RETURN TO THE APP

EU versions of Fortnite when submitting the game to the App Store.
Apple says it will not consider adding the game to the US App Store
until everything is fully settled involving litigation between Epic
and Apple. Epic has asked the courts to force Apple to allow Fortnite
to relaunch on the US App Store.
