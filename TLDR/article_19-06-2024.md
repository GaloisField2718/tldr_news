 NVIDIA PASSES MICROSOFT IN MARKET CAP TO BECOME MOST VALUABLE PUBLIC
COMPANY (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nvidia is now the most valuable public company in the world. Its
market cap surpassed Microsoft's $3.32 trillion on Tuesday, reaching a
high of $3.34 trillion. Nvidia's shares are up more than 170% so far
this year. Its market cap hit $3 trillion for the first time earlier
this month. Nvidia's rise has been so rapid the company has yet to be
added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the stock benchmark of the
30 most valuable US companies. 

 APPLE HALTS WORK ON VISION PRO, AIMS TO RELEASE CHEAPER VISION
HEADSET NEXT YEAR (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple will repeatedly release a cheaper, cut-down version of the
Apple Vision Pro at the end of 2025. Development work on a second
generation of the high-end model of the Vision Pro has been shelved.
Reports suggest that the cheaper Vision Pro will cost around $1,500.
Apple is apparently struggling to find ways to cut the price and
weight of the device without sacrificing too much of the experience.

 AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE GREAT AT DRIVING STRAIGHT (4 MINUTE READ) [7]


 A recent study, which analyzed over 37,000 accidents involving
autonomous and human-driven vehicles, found that while autonomous
vehicles (AVs) were generally less prone to accidents than
human-driven vehicles, they significantly underperformed against
humans in some situations. The study found that level 4 AVs were over
five times more likely to be involved in an accident at dawn and dusk
and that the odds of an accident during a turn were almost double in
AVs compared to human-driven vehicles. It highlights the need for
better data and stronger intelligence for decision-making. 

 ‚ÄòIT'S THE PERFECT PLACE': LONDON UNDERGROUND HOSTS TESTS FOR
‚ÄòQUANTUM COMPASS' THAT COULD REPLACE GPS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists in the UK are developing very precise new sensors using
quantum mechanics to create a quantum compass - an instrument that
exploits the behavior of subatomic matter to accurately pinpoint their
locations no matter where they're placed. This could result in a new
generation of underground and underwater sensors that can provide
location information without interference from weather and other
obstructions. Their device could be ready for widespread use in just a
few years. It works well in a stable laboratory environment but needs
to be tested in more extreme conditions to be turned into a
transportable, standalone device that can be used in remote or complex
locations.

 ‚úÇÔ∏è CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED TESTING
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 QA Wolf [10] offers a cost-effective approach to getting 80%
automated test coverage in just 4 months ‚Äî even for the most complex
web apps. And they guarantee zero flakes. [9]

Plus, they include unlimited parallel runs [9] on their infrastructure
+ 24-hour maintenance and triage.

The result? This case study shows how AutoTrader saved $600K+/year
[11] on QA engineering, reduced QA cycles from days to 15 minutes and
boosted release velocity by 15-20%.

 THE THREADS API IS FINALLY HERE! (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Meta's Threads API is now available to all developers. The API will
enable creators, developers, and brands to build their own unique
integrations, manage their Threads presence at scale, and easily share
content with their communities. It allows people to publish posts,
fetch content, set reply and quote controls, retrieve and respond to
replies, hide and unhide specific replies, and retrieve key metrics.
Links to developer documentation and a sample app are available. 

 COGNITIVE LOAD IS WHAT MATTERS (20 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Confusion, which costs time and money, is caused by high cognitive
load. Cognitive load is how much a developer needs to think in order
to complete a task. Developers should constantly ask themselves
whether they are embedding excessive cognitive load into their code as
far more time is spent reading and understanding code than writing it.
They should make things easy to understand to avoid creating
unnecessary cognitive load for themselves and their colleagues.

 THE PUBLIC INTEREST INTERNET (73 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article looks at the global digital architecture required to
make the internet a public interest technology. It looks at what
should be considered as digital infrastructure and the consequences of
its capture, the problems with current approaches to internet
standards, limits to the main approach to digital regulation that
states are deploying, how to approach the governance of transnational
public infrastructure, how to pay for this, and more. While creating a
public interest internet would be difficult, the alternative, keeping
our digital infrastructure entirely in the hands of a few
megacorporations, could be more costly. 

 AIS ARE COMING FOR SOCIAL NETWORKS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Butterfly is a social network made up of AI characters. Its app
allows users to create AI characters, or Butterflies, which generate
photos and interact with other accounts on their own. There's no limit
to the number of Butterflies users can create. These AI profiles
coexist with human accounts, which can also post and comment. The app
provides a peek into a somewhat dystopian future where AIs start
invading social media feeds - Mark Zuckerberg shared in September that
Meta is building an AI Studio that would let users build AIs that can
post and interact with people on their behalf.

 VISUAL STUDIO CODE EXTENSIONS ARE MUCH LESS SECURE THAN BROWSER
EXTENSIONS OR EVEN NPM PACKAGES (3 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Extensions in Visual Studio Code can do pretty much whatever they
want, they automatically update, publisher accounts are too easy to
verify, the code shipped in an update can differ from what's on
GitHub, and there's no way to verify the data being used in the
extension store indicating popularity or trust-worthiness.
