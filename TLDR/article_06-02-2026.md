 ANTHROPIC RELEASES OPUS 4.6 WITH NEW ‘AGENT TEAMS' (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Anthropic's latest version of Opus features Agent Teams, teams of
agents that can split larger tasks into segmented jobs. It also comes
with a one-million-token context window, allowing for the processing
of larger documents. The segmenting of agent responsibilities allows
them to coordinate work in parallel to complete tasks faster. Agent
Teams is currently available in a research preview for API users and
subscribers. 

 OPENAI UNVEILS FRONTIER, A PRODUCT FOR BUILDING ‘AI CO-WORKERS' (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI Frontier is a new AI platform for building, deploying, and
overseeing AI agents. It makes it easier for businesses to combine
sources of data that agents need to perform tasks. The agents act as
co-workers that can collaborate with humans and can be used alongside
agents developed by other labs. Frontier is currently available to a
limited set of customers. OpenAI has yet to disclose prices for the
feature.

 INSIDE ELON MUSK'S $1.25 TRILLION AI AND SPACE MEGAMERGER (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 SpaceX and xAI signed a merger agreement at the end of last month.
Merging the two companies is a level of risk-taking and ambition that
is novel even for Elon Musk. It is a bet on Musk's plan for the
convergence of AI and space - a wager on unproven technology deployed
at a vast scale. SpaceX representatives have confirmed that the
company plans to go public this summer. 

 CHINA IS RUNNING THE EV PLAYBOOK ON HUMANOID ROBOTS — AND IT'S
WORKING (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Nearly 90% of all humanoid robots sold globally last year were
Chinese. The humanoid robot industry is still in its infancy, but
China's progress will potentially lock it into a commanding position.
Its early advantage is due to a combination of policy support, public
investment, a mature supply chain, and advancements made in AI
software and hardware. The global market for humanoid robots in 2035
is estimated to grow to $38 billion.

 INTRODUCING GPT-5.3-CODEX (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 GPT-5.3-Codex is OpenAI's most capable agentic coding model to date.
It advances both the frontier coding performance of GPT-5.2-Codex and
the reasoning and professional knowledge capabilities of GPT-5.2 while
being 25% faster. The model can take on long-running tasks that
involve research, tool use, and complex execution. Developers can
steer and interact with the model while it's working without losing
context. 

 MY AI ADOPTION JOURNEY (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Mitchell Hashimoto, a developer who co-founded HashiCorp, has reached
a point where he is having success with modern AI tooling. His
approach uses a proper, measured view grounded in reality. This post
shares Hashimoto's approach to navigating these new tools and gives a
glimpse into how he approaches new tools in general, regardless of AI.
Hashimoto is a software craftsman who just wants to build stuff for
the love of the game, so it doesn't matter to him whether AI is here
to stay.

 GOOGLE HINTS AT BIG AIRDROP EXPANSION FOR ANDROID “VERY SOON” (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google is expanding AirDrop support to the rest of the Android
ecosystem this year. Currently, only Google Pixel 10 devices can
initiate an AirDrop session with Apple devices. AirDrop support allows
Android devices to send files to Apple devices without downloading
third-party apps. Google tends to time its Android ecosystem updates
with Pixel Drops, and the next one of those is expected in March. 

 DEATH OF SOFTWARE. NAH (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Wall Street tends to run in herds, and the past couple of weeks have
seen the herd collectively conclude that software is somehow dead.
This is nonsense. There will be more software than ever before.
AI-enabled or AI-centric software is simply moving up the stack of
what a product is. Domain experience will become more important than
it is today because every domain will become vastly more sophisticated
than it is now.
