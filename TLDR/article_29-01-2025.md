 WILL YOUR AI-GENERATED SAAS APP SURVIVE REAL WORLD TRAFFIC? (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 With AI-assisted coding, it's trivial to ship a SaaS in days. But
what happens when you release that app into the wild?

🤖 Bots. Countless bots. Bots that easily bypass traditional
detection [5]—executing JavaScript, handling cookies and sessions
like real browsers, rotating through residential IPs, and even solving
most CAPTCHAs.

Protect your shiny new codebase with WorkOS Radar [4] 😏

WorkOS Radar slots right into your auth flow with a single JS import,
instantly detecting brute force attempts, malicious bots, and
scrapers. When it detects bot activity, Radar checks for trusted
patterns to decide whether to block, allow, or flag.

Keep bots out of your app and live another day.

 APPLE AND SPACEX LINK UP TO SUPPORT STARLINK SATELLITE NETWORK ON
IPHONES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple has been working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US to add support for
the Starlink network in its latest iPhone update. T-Mobile this week
enabled a small number of iPhones as part of its beta test of the
Starlink service. Users in the program have access to a new toggle
switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite
feature. T-Mobile is aiming to support the vast majority of modern
smartphones when the service fully launches. 

 DEEPSEEK CHIEF'S JOURNEY FROM MATH GEEK TO GLOBAL DISRUPTOR (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 China's DeepSeek is led by Liang Wenfeng, a math geek who caught the
investing bug. Liang's hedge fund, High-Flyer, manages around $8
billion, making it one of China's largest quantitative funds. He has
been described as a hands-on leader who sometimes sleeps in the office
with colleagues as they rush to get projects done. Liang keeps a low
profile and was surprised to see DeepSeek turn into a frenzy
overnight. DeepSeek's sudden popularity caught the company off guard,
making Liang work with his team to address the demand before taking a
break for the Lunar New Year holiday in China.

 BOOM'S XB-1 BECOMES FIRST CIVIL AIRCRAFT TO GO SUPERSONIC (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Boom Superconic's XB-1 demonstrator plane went supersonic in the
skies over California's Mojave Desert on its 12th test flight. It
cleared Mach 1 and stayed supersonic for around four minutes, reaching
Mach 1.1. This is the first time a supersonic engine has come from
something other than a nation-state. Boom already has customers
waiting for its technology when it matures. The company is doing some
work with the US Air Force, but it remains focused on making
supersonic passenger travel a reality again. 

 NEW GLOWING MOLECULE, INVENTED BY AI, WOULD HAVE TAKEN 500 MILLION
YEARS TO EVOLVE IN NATURE, SCIENTISTS SAY (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Scientists used an AI model to simulate 500 million years of
molecular evolution, which resulted in the code for a previously
unknown glowing protein similar to those found in jellyfish and
corals. While the simulated protein only exists in computer code, the
model used to create it may help in the development of new medicines.
The model, called ESM3, doesn't design proteins within the usual
constraints of evolution - it is a problem-solver that fills in gaps
of incomplete protein code. ESM3 learns fundamental biology and then
creates functional proteins outside the space explored by evolution.

 COMPLETE HARDWARE + SOFTWARE SETUP FOR RUNNING DEEPSEEK-R1 LOCALLY (6
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This thread details a $6,000 setup for running the full DeepSeek-R1
model locally. The setup requires two CPUs and 768GB of RAM across 24
RAM channels. It doesn't include a GPU, though a GPU can be added for
faster generation speed. The build described in the thread can
generate six to eight tokens per second, depending on the specific CPU
and RAM speed purchased. A video of the build running inference is
available in the thread. 

 INTRODUCING CODENAME GOOSE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Goose is an open source AI agent built to automate tasks. It can be
powered by a range of large language models and features a
user-friendly desktop interface and command-line interface. Goose is
designed to enhance productivity and workflows by taking instructions
and then doing the work for users. Its first use cases are engineering
focused, but the community has been exploring other non-engineering
use cases.

 DEEPSEEK PANIC AT THE APP STORE (63 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DeepSeek's app shot to #1 on the US App Store recently and is getting
around 300,000 global daily downloads. It may be the first
non-GPT-based assistant to get mainstream usage in the US. Released on
January 11, many users see it as a free version of OpenAI's premium
models. This article looks at DeepSeek's rise, why its app is
currently topping the charts, DeepSeek's business model, the company's
impact on the stock market, and much more. DeepSeek's open source
software means that anyone can run the technology on their own
computer, so it is unlikely that the US government will be able to
block it in any reasonable way. 

 INSIDE CHINA, DEEPSEEK PROVIDES A NATIONAL MIC DROP MOMENT (9 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 The news that a Chinese startup could build artificial intelligence
models as good as OpenAI's at a fraction of the cost tanked the stock
market and sent Silicon Valley into a panic. DeepSeek's achievement
was a testament to China's ability to innovate, especially when faced
with efforts to limit the country's access to the most advanced
technologies. The company's rise may be putting it in an awkward
position - China has been cracking down on the tech sector in recent
years as it is wary of tech companies' growing influence. Investors
are hoping the government will refrain from interfering with DeepSeek.
