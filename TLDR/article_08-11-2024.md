 REPORT: 53% OF BUSINESS AND IT LEADERS VIEW CYBERSECURITY IS SEEN AS
THE TOP RISK FOR THEIR ORGANIZATION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Vanta's State of Trust Report [4] uncovers key trends in security,
compliance, and the future of trust based on a survey of 2,500
business and IT leaders.

The survey reveals a security landscape that's never been more
challenging [4]—with cybersecurity threats ranking as the #1 concern
for businesses in 2024.

The report also finds that building good security is good business,
with nearly half (48%) of respondents saying that good security
practices drive customer trust for their business.

 APPLE IS FINALLY LETTING GREEN BUBBLES SEND MESSAGE REACTIONS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 iOS 18.1 can display emoji reactions from Android users correctly.
iOS was unable to display message reactions correctly when RCS first
launched on the platform in September. Apple has been ignoring
Google's campaign to adopt RCS for years, only complying after
pressure from both China and the EU. The company will likely keep as
many exclusive features as possible for its iMessage service as long
as it isn't forced to change. 

 META IS OPENING A POP-UP RETAIL STORE FOR THE RAY-BAN META GLASSES (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta Lab, a pop-up experiential retail space for Ray-Ban Meta Smart
Glasses, will open on November 8 in Los Angeles. The temporary store
will allow customers to try out the glasses and customize glasses
cases. There will be events with various creators, live podcasts, and
cooking classes. The store will close on December 31. Another Meta Lab
experience is planned for Phoenix at the end of January.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 PHYSICISTS STIR A SUPERSOLID FOR FIRST TIME, PROVING ITS BIZARRE DUAL
NATURE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scientists have successfully stirred a supersolid, a strange type of
matter that is both rigid and fluid, for the first time. Supersolids
have the properties of both solids and superfluids - a fraction of
atoms flow friction-free through a lattice of a rigid crystal
structure. Stirring the supersolid resulted in tiny whirlpools called
quantized vortices, an indication of superfluidity. The breakthrough
will make it possible to simulate phenomena in the lab that normally
occur under truly extreme conditions, like in the hearts of neutron
stars. 

 AIRBORNE MICROPLASTICS AID IN CLOUD FORMATION (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 New research suggests that microplastics in the air could affect
weather and climate by producing clouds in conditions where they would
not form otherwise. Clouds form when water vapor sticks to tiny
floating particles in the atmosphere. Water droplets with microplastic
particles can produce ice crystals at temperatures 5 to 10 degrees
Celsius warmer than droplets without microplastics. Precipitation
typically starts as ice particles. More information about microplastic
concentrations at the altitudes where clouds form is needed before
scientists can make theories on how exactly microplastics affect
weather and climate.

 RAILS 8.0: NO PAAS REQUIRED (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Deploying modern web apps has become so hard that many developers
have become reliant on Platform-as-a-Service. Rails 8 includes tools
to make the process more simple. These include Kamal 2, a tool that
turns fresh Linux boxes into application or accessory servers with
just a single command, and Thruster, a proxy that provides X-Sendfile
acceleration, asset caching, and asset compression. This blog post
covers the highlights of the new Rails release. 

 BEMIDB (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 BemiDB is a simple and cost-effective cloud analytics platform. It
connects and automatically synchronizes data from existing PostgreSQL
databases and other data sources, storing data in a columnar format
that's ready for querying. BemiDB makes data accessible for analysis
in near real-time without additional pipelines or transformations.

 AMAZON CEO ANDY JASSY DENIES THAT 5-DAY OFFICE MANDATE IS A 'BACKDOOR
LAYOFF' (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Amazon's five-day in-office mandate was not made to reduce headcount
or appease city officials, according to CEO Andy Jassy. The topic was
brought up during an all-hands meeting on Tuesday. Jassy says that the
decision to get workers back into the office was about the company's
culture and strengthening that culture. Returning workers to the
office will allow employees to be better set up to invent,
collaborate, and be connected. Amazon employees will have to return to
the office five days a week starting from January 2. 

 A NEW CITY SPRINGS FROM THE RAINFOREST TO BECOME INDONESIA'S TECH HUB
(9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Indonesia is building a new capital to replace Jakarta as the current
capital is sinking - in some areas, at a rate of 25 cm per year. This
was caused by the over-extraction of groundwater and the sheer weight
of buildings. Nusantara, the new city, aims to be a model of
livability and sustainability. It will be powered predominantly by
renewable energy with the aim of being carbon neutral by 2045. This
article looks at the project and its aims and challenges. Local
opinions of the project are mixed - many locals have taken to
referring to the city as 'Wakanda' as a way to criticize government
decisions and officials without the risk of imprisonment.
