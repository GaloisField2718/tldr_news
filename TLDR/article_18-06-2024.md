 üëâ¬†GET TO 80% AUTOMATED E2E TEST COVERAGE IN LESS THAN 4 MONTHS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Listen up, engineering leaders üì£: Bugs sneak out when less than
80% of user flows are tested before shipping.

However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there) is hard and
pricey for any team.

Fortunately, QA Wolf [4] takes testing off your plate. They can get
you:

 	* 80% test coverage in just four months [4]‚Äînot years
 	* unlimited parallel test runs [4]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* zero flakes guarantee

This case study shows how AutoTrader saved $600K+/year [5] on QA
engineering, reduced QA cycles from days to 15 minutes and boosted
release velocity by 15-20%.

 US SUES ADOBE FOR ‚ÄòDECEIVING' SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT ARE TOO HARD TO
CANCEL (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The US government is suing Adobe for allegedly hiding expensive fees
and making it difficult to cancel a subscription. The complaint claims
that Adobe failed to properly disclose an early termination fee that
can amount to hundreds of dollars. Customers have to go through an
onerous and complicated process when canceling their subscription that
involves navigating through multiple webpages and pop-ups. They
encounter similar obstacles when attempting to cancel their
subscriptions over the phone or via live chats. A copy of the
complaint against Adobe is available at the end of the article.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SCIENTISTS PRESERVE DNA IN AN AMBER-LIKE POLYMER (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MIT researchers have developed an amber-like polymer that can be used
for long-term storage of DNA. It can store DNA at room temperature
while protecting the molecules from damage caused by heat or water.
The DNA can be easily removed from the polymer without damage. The
process of embedding DNA into the polymer takes a few hours, but the
researchers believe that the process can be sped up with further
optimization. 

 TDK CLAIMS INSANE ENERGY DENSITY IN SOLID-STATE BATTERY BREAKTHROUGH
(3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Japanese company TDK claims it has made a material that provides an
energy density of 1,000 watt-hours per liter, about 100 times greater
than TDK's current batteries. The material will enable smaller device
sizes and longer operating times. It offers a higher degree of
stability and safety, but its fragility makes it impractical for use
in cars or smartphones. TDK plans to start shipping samples of its new
battery prototypes to clients next year before moving into mass
production.
