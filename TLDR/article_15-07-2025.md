 META'S NEW SUPERINTELLIGENCE LAB IS DISCUSSING MAJOR A.I. STRATEGY
CHANGES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A small group of members in Meta's newly formed superintelligence lab
last week discussed the possibility of abandoning the company's most
powerful open source AI model, Behemoth, in favor of developing a
closed model. Meta has chosen to open source its AI models for years,
with executives arguing that it is better for the technology to be
public to accelerate AI development and make the technology more
accessible to developers. A move to a closed AI model would be a
philosophical change as much as a technical one. Meta has been
delaying the release of its Behemoth model due to its poor internal
performance. 

 GOOGLE EXEC: ‘WE'RE GOING TO BE COMBINING CHROMEOS AND ANDROID' (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google plans to combine Android with ChromeOS. Chromebooks can
already run many Android apps, and Android has been moving closer to
ChromeOS with new features like desktop mode, resizable windows, and
improved support for external displays. Bringing the two operating
systems together makes sense as it will speed up feature development
and improve functionality on tablets.

 COVID-19 VACCINE TECHNOLOGY ADAPTED TO DEVELOP FIRST MRNA DEFENSE
AGAINST ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT BACTERIA (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Israeli researchers have created an mRNA-based vaccine against
Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes bubonic plague. The
researchers hope the technology can be used to combat other lethal
bacteria as well. When tested on animal models, the vaccine achieved
100% protection against pneumonic plague. The success of the study
paves the way for a whole world of mRNA-based vaccines against other
deadly bacteria. 

 DARPA SETS NEW RECORD FOR WIRELESS POWER BEAMING (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The United States' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
recently transferred over 800 watts of power over about 30 seconds
with a laser beam across 8.6 kilometers. The estimated power
efficiency was around 20%. The team used commercial ready-to-use solar
cells placed within a receiver to turn the laser beam into
electricity. Laser technologies are more suitable than infrared for
building an airborne power relay network due to their high precision,
long-range reach, and lighter and smaller equipment required to work.

 AWS PREVIEWS KIRO IDE FOR DEVELOPERS WHO ARE OVER VIBE CODING (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AWS has introduced a new agentic IDE called Kiro that apparently
avoids the pitfalls of vibe coding. It is built around a
conversational interface that offers developers the chance to explain
what they are trying to build. Kiro then uses generative AI to produce
its response, which initially takes the form of a spec, not actual
code. Kiro can handle multiple specs created by different teams that
all work on different aspects of a project. It can use plugins written
for VS Code and Open VSX. 

 HOW DOES A SCREEN WORK? (24 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Modern computing isn't possible without digital displays. The
technology is underappreciated because most people have no idea how
the technology works. This article covers the history of digital
displays, how different types of displays work, what pixels are and
why we use them, and much more. Understanding how a screen works
unlocks a lot of understanding of how color works on digital displays,
rasterization, GPUs, and shaders.

 META CEO ZUCKERBERG SAYS FIRST AI DATA SUPERCLUSTER WILL COME ONLINE
IN 2026 (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Meta plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into artificial
intelligence compute infrastructure. It aims to bring its first
supercluster online next year. Meta has been on a multibillion-dollar
AI hiring spree in recent weeks. CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly grew
frustrated with Meta's progress in AI, so he is revamping the
company's approach to better compete with rivals like OpenAI and
Google. 

 TIKTOK OWNER BYTEDANCE IS REPORTEDLY BUILDING ITS OWN MIXED REALITY
GOGGLES (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 ByteDance is reportedly working on mixed reality goggles designed to
layer digital objects over users' view of the real world to compete
directly with Meta's upcoming mixed reality products. They will be
built by ByteDance's Pico, the creators of the Pico 4 VR headset. Pico
will keep the device lightweight by offloading most of the computing
work to a puck connected to the goggles over a wire. Current Pico
headsets aren't sold in the US, and ByteDance may face pushback over a
US release due to its ownership of TikTok.
