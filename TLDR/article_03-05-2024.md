AMERICA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Doctors once told you to skip the salt and drink eight daily glasses
of water‚Ä¶ ü•õ

But recent studies suggest you need 3x more sodium than the US
government advises, and much less H20.

Keeping a good balance of water and minerals [4] is the name of the
game for mental and physical performance.

 OPENAI TO CHALLENGE GOOGLE WITH ITS OWN SEARCH ENGINE IN MAY (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Reports indicate that OpenAI is looking to launch a search engine
soon. OpenAI's in-house event on May 9 may focus on its release,
although the event times and date may be subject to change. Google has
scheduled its annual developer conference for May 14 - OpenAI's event
may be a strategy to upstage Google before the search giant makes its
AI announcements. This article presents the evidence for OpenAI's
search plans. 

 TESLA IS PREPARING TO LAUNCH ITS OWN IN-CAR VOICE ASSISTANT (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Tesla's latest software update includes hidden code that suggests
that the company is preparing for the launch of its voice assistant.
Little is known about the new Tesla voice assistant, but Elon Musk has
previously said that he wants Tesla drivers to be able to do
everything in the car with no manual input. The software update also
introduces a native Audible app.

 SPACEX ADDS COSMIC TOURISM OFFERING TO WEBSITE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new 'Human Spaceflight' tab on SpaceX's website offers flights to
Earth's orbit, the International Space Station (ISS), the Moon, and
Mars, with missions beginning as early as this year. There is no
pricing information for the offerings and interested customers will
have to inquire through email. The Earth orbit mission, which will
last three to six days, offers a view of the planet from 300
kilometers high for two to four passengers. Ten-day commercial
missions to the ISS will be available as early as 2025. The missions
to lunar orbit and Mars do not have listed timelines. 

 FOUND: THE DIAL IN THE BRAIN THAT CONTROLS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scientists have identified the brain cells that regulate inflammation
and determined how they keep tabs on the immune response. The neurons
that act as the master dial for the immune system live in the brain
stem, the stalk-like structure that connects the bulk of the brain to
the spinal cord. The finding could lead to treatments for autoimmune
diseases and other conditions caused by an excessive immune response.
The mechanism by which the brain sends signals back to the immune
system to regulate inflammation remains unclear.

 OFFSET-ALLOCATOR (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 offset-allocator is a fast, simple, and hard real-time allocator
especially useful for managing GPU resources. It is a port of
Sebastian Aaltonen's OffsetAllocator package for C++, rewritten in
100% safe Rust. While the general algorithm in the crate could be
adapted to construct a Rust allocator, this is beyond the scope of the
implementation. offset-allocator is completely agnostic to what it's
allocating. It only knows about a contiguous block of memory of a
specific size. 

 NOT ALL GRAPHS ARE TREES (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Relational algebra can easily be represented as trees as formulas are
already structurally rooted trees where each operator has its inputs
as children. Things get more complicated when introducing non-tree
structures, like some kind of self-join. This can be resolved using
inlining (simply duplicating the expression you want to reference
twice) or let binding. Common methods to open up unrestricted access
to represent graphs containing cycles in programs include
self-referencing, using a fix point operator, and explicitly listing
edges.

 U.S. V. GOOGLE: AS LANDMARK 'MONOPOLY POWER' TRIAL CLOSES, HERE'S
WHAT TO LOOK FOR (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The trial for the US Department of Justice's case against Google for
using anti-competitive tactics to monopolize online search is now over
and closing arguments are underway. Google's parent company Alphabet
controls roughly 90% of the US search engine market, but the company
claims its success is due to the quality of its product, not because
of its business dealings. The ruling for the case could have
far-reaching effects on how people use and interact with the internet.
If the judge rules against Google, the consequences could be anything
from fines to a restructuring of the company. 

 BUILDING A ROCKET ENGINE FROM SCRATCH (26 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Engine development is unforgiving - thousands of decisions have to go
right for them to work. This article looks at how ABL went from
nothing to having ten flight-worthy engines tested and installed on a
rocket in under four years. It covers the decision-making that went
into developing ABL's engines, testing, the company's growth, and
more. Pictures of the company's engines and engine testing rounds are
available in the article.
