 MUSK RESTRUCTURES XAI'S TEAMS AFTER CO-FOUNDERS DEPART (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Elon Musk has restructured xAI following the exit of two of its
co-founders earlier this week. xAI will now be organized into four
core areas: Grok's chatbot and voice product, Coding, the Imagine
video product, and Macrohard. The company plans to launch a new X Chat
app and X Money in the coming months. It is currently looking to hire.


 APPLE'S LATEST ATTEMPT TO LAUNCH NEW SIRI RUNS INTO SNAGS (9 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Several highly anticipated Siri functions may be pushed back as
testing has run into snags in recent weeks. Apple now plans to spread
out new capabilities over several versions, so some features will be
postponed until iOS 26.5 or iOS 27. One feature especially likely to
slip is the expanded ability for Siri to tap into personal data.
Another feature running behind schedule is voice-based control of
in-app actions. While early support for these features exists, they
don't function reliably in all cases.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 SCENT, IN SILICO (37 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Tech is starting to turn to AI to probe the possibility of digitizing
smell in the hopes of understanding and manipulating this sensory
modality. Programming smell may illuminate many mysteries about the
sense. It could also have many practical applications, for example,
computational smell could help detect gas leaks, reduce reliance on
intensive natural ingredients for perfume, or lead to the creation of
entirely novel smells. This article takes a look at the state of the
research and the future of the industry. 

 CHINA SHOWCASES NEW MOON SHIP AND REUSABLE ROCKET IN ONE
EXTRAORDINARY TEST (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 China's space program successfully carried out a flight of a new
reusable booster and crew capsule late Tuesday. The Long March 10
rocket and Mengzhou spacecraft are core elements of China's lunar
architecture. The US and China are racing to accomplish the next human
landing on the Moon in a competition for national prestige and lunar
resources. The successful test moves Chinese engineers closer to
human-rating the Mengzhou crew capsule. A video recapping the test
flight is available in the article.

 CODING AGENTS MEET DISTRIBUTED REALITY (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Most future distributed code will be AI-generated. This makes it
important whether we ask AI to aim for ordinary imperative code or at
frameworks where distributed contracts are part of the language
surface. Targets like this help developers focus on the right
questions rather than chasing shadows. AI can help build systems that
fail less often if given a target that reflects distributed reality. 

 HOW I USE CLAUDE CODE (15 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Never let Claude write code until you have reviewed and approved a
written plan. This separation of planning and execution prevents
wasted effort, keeps users in control of architectural decisions, and
produces significantly better results with minimal token usage. This
post describes a workflow that follows this core principle. The
workflow is radically different from how most people approach AI
tools.

 SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING (28 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI works, it improves predictably, and the richest institutions in
history are committing trillions to it. It isn't a fad. The next few
years will be disorienting in ways most people aren't prepared for.
The people who will come out of this best are the ones who start
engaging now. 

 TOOL SHAPED OBJECTS (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The story of the AI boom so far is one where the dominant narrative
about AI is not what it has built, but the rate at which people are
consuming it, the rate at which companies are spending on GPU farms,
and the rate at which tools are being expensed. AI is everywhere in
consumption and almost nowhere in output. We are spending
unprecedented sums to invest in systems, and the primary product of
that spending is the experience of spending it.

product-market fit has been reached, and the endgame is the infinite
future that is never really reached.
