 HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR HYDRATION FOR PEAK PRODUCTIVITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 As techies, we love optimizing stuff. Ever thought of optimizing your
hydration?

Turns out, the key to unlocking peak mental performance is
electrolytes ‚Äî not chugging more water or caffeine. In fact,
overhydrating can cause brain fog and fatigue by diluting blood sodium
levels.

Enter LMNT [5] ‚Äî a zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix [4] was created
by a former research biochemist to deliver the optimal ratio of
sodium, potassium and magnesium.

Engineers and CTOs use LMNT to power through long coding sessions,
stay in a flow state [4], and boost mental clarity. And with no
artificial ingredients or dodgy chemicals, LMNT is the clean way to
stay productive for longer.

Get your free LMNT Sample Pack [4] with any drink mix purchase. Just

 INSIDE SILICON VALLEY'S GRAND AMBITIONS TO CONTROL OUR PLANET'S
THERMOSTAT (23 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Private interests have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into
reversing climate change in recent years. These private investment
organizations claim that they have been forced to act as governments
and the academic world have been dawdling. There is little regulation
to govern geoengineering. This article looks at different projects in
the space and their challenges. 

 ARE SYNTHETIC WOMBS THE FUTURE OF CHILDBIRTH? NEW CHINESE EXPERIMENT
SPARKS DEBATE (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Chinese researchers recently announced a groundbreaking synthetic
womb experiment without the use of extra corporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO allows for oxygenation of fetus blood after
removal from the mother's body, bypassing the heart and lungs,
allowing these organs to rest and heal. It is expensive and comes with
risks such as blood clots and infections. An ECMO-free artificial womb
would significantly lower costs - the operating costs of ECMO are
around $9,000 a day.

 IS IT TIME TO VERSION OBSERVABILITY? (SIGNS POINT TO YES) (17 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The observability industry has stuck to metrics, logs, and traces
over the years because they describe the daily reality for engineers.
While the language used to describe the problems and solutions has
evolved, the solutions are still largely the same as they were a
decade ago. While they have massively improved, they're structurally
variations on the same pre-aggregated metrics. It's now getting harder
and harder to speak clearly about different approaches and solutions -
a problem semantic versioning was made to solve.

 ENGINEERING THE FIRST FITBIT: THE INSIDE STORY (16 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Inspired by the Wii, entrepreneur James Park came up with the Fitbit
as a gadget to get people out of the house. The activity tracker has
sold more than 136 million units since 2009. Google bought the company
in 2021 for $2.1 billion and absorbed it into its hardware division.
This article looks at the origins of Fitbit and the challenges it
faced early in development. 

 WHY GOOGLE DECIDED NOW'S THE TIME TO MOVE ON FROM CHROMECAST (7
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Google is phasing out the Chromecast in favor of the new Google TV
streamer after more than a decade. The company decided to focus on a
higher-end device because there is too much competition for
inexpensive streaming devices. The Google TV steamer infuses Gemini AI
smarts into the software and puts smart home controls on the TV
screen. It is faster than the often-laggy Chromecast. The device will
go on sale in September for $99.
