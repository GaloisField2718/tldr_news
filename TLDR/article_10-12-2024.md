 TESLA MODEL Q IS REPORTEDLY COMING IN FIRST HALF 2025: HERE'S WHAT IT
WILL COST (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Tesla Model Q will launch in the first half of 2025 and cost less
than $30,000 with subsidies, or $37,499 if Trump cancels the IRA tax
credit. It will be built on Tesla's existing lines. Tesla told
investors during its Q3 earning calls that it planned to develop a
more affordable model in H1 2025. The Model Q will be 15% smaller and
30% lighter than the Model 3. It will have a steering wheel and pedals
but will be geared toward autonomous driving functionality. 

 OPENAI RELEASES SORA, ITS BUZZY AI VIDEO-GENERATION TOOL (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has released Sora, its AI video-generation model. Sora will be
available to US users and most countries internationally but OpenAI
has no timeline yet for launching the tool in Europe and the UK. It
will be included in existing ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscriptions. Sora
is aimed at competing with video-generation AI tools from other
companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and Stability AI.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 QUANTUM COMPUTERS CROSS CRITICAL ERROR THRESHOLD (11 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Researchers have shown that adding more qubits to a quantum computer
can make it more resilient. The scientists transformed a group of
physical qubits into a single logical qubit and then showed that the
logical qubit's error rates dropped sharply as they added more
physical qubits to the group. The result has thrilled quantum
computing researchers, but the technology still has a long way to go.
There are still many challenges to overcome before quantum computing
becomes a viable technology. 

 BLUE ORIGIN SAYS NEW GLENN ON TRACK TO LAUNCH BEFORE END OF 2024 (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Blue Origin says it's on track to launch New Glenn before the end of
the year, but it is still waiting on regulatory approval to conduct a
final key test of the rocket. The hot fire test will involve powering
up all seven of the first stage's BE-4 engines and firing them to full
thrust while the rocket sits on the pad. It is designed to mirror how
the vehicle will operate during lift-off. The 320-foot-tall rocket
will be capable of carrying 45 metric tons to low Earth orbit.

 TASK-SPECIFIC LLM EVALS THAT DO & DON'T WORK (33 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post shares useful evaluations for large language models that
focus on simple, common tasks like classification/extraction,
summarization, and translation. The post also discusses the role of
human evaluation and how to calibrate the evaluation bar to balance
between potential benefits and risks. It was written to be accessible
for those without a data science or machine learning background.

 WHY THE COOLEST JOB IN TECH MIGHT ACTUALLY BE IN A BANK (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Jobs in financial services companies are more desirable than they
have ever been. Banks say they are still aggressively hiring.
Compensation is similar for comparable roles across tech and banking.
However, tech companies are no longer rolling out the red carpet for
their employees. Banks are increasingly looking to publicize their AI
work, invest in pure research departments, and focus on upskilling and
internal development. 

 THE ‚ÄúQUIET QUITTING‚Äù MYTH IS TOXIC FOR TECH (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The idea that $300k/year engineers are doing next to nothing as a
norm in tech is damaging and ridiculous. The myth misleads aspiring
engineers, fuels layoff culture, and damages the industry's
reputation. While it is true some employees coast, glorifying this
idea only perpetuates toxicity. Engineers should instead focus on
creating realistic expectations, better leadership, and healthier work
cultures.
