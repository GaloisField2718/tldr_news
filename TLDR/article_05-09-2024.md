 TESLA RELEASES 'ACTUALLY SMART SUMMON': FEATURES & VIDEOS (6 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Tesla's FSD v12.5.3 features Actually Smart Summon, a type of summon
available on vehicles without ultrasonic sensors. The update is
currently going out to early-access customers. It is being rolled out
to both AI4 and HW3 cars. Actually Smart Summon has greatly improved
capabilities over its predecessor and uses end-to-end AI rather than
relying on hand-coded features to control vehicles. The feature is
expected to roll out to North America first before gradually rolling
out to additional countries.

THEY'RE A MIXED BAG (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI's SearchGPT aims to rival Google Search by offering a new
AI-driven approach to finding information online. It compiles its
answers using data from Bing and other sources. Reports from early
users say that the tool sometimes provides inaccurate or hallucinated
information. The tool is not yet ready to challenge Google's
dominance.

 INSIDE THE TENSE DECISION BETWEEN NASA AND BOEING TO SEND STARLINER
HOME ALONE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NASA made the announcement that Boeing's Starliner would return
uncrewed on August 24. Starliner is now scheduled to undock this
Friday, with another window four days later if conditions are
unfavorable. The decision took many weeks to make. While Boeing
believed Starliner was capable of bringing back its crew, NASA was not
comfortable with the idea due to uncertainty in the modeling. The
astronauts will return home on a SpaceX Dragon vehicle in late
February 2025 at the earliest.

year.

 THE DAWN OF A NEW STARTUP ERA (31 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Purely Internet-based startups are approaching a saturation point. A
new breed of startups that are willing to take on a lot more tech risk
are starting to supplant the currently dominant species. The new
startup era coming up will be heavier on technology and have longer
incubation periods and likely higher capital intensity to fund
ultra-specialized research that won't be easily commoditized.
Investors will need to be more comfortable with tech slides and do
more scientific due diligence. 

 HACKING SALES AS AN INTROVERT (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The sales process is just finding prospects, convincing them to talk
to you, and getting them to buy. Sales is information theory and
charisma can be systematized. Reaching out gives prospects more
information - doing this well massively boosts the likelihood of
success. Use questions as launch points to tell stories that portray
what you want - this works because of how humans build rapport.
