 NLWEB IS MICROSOFT'S PROJECT TO BRING MORE CHATBOTS TO WEB PAGES (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Microsoft's NLWeb project enables websites to provide a
conversational interface for users with a few lines of code, the AI
model of their choice, and their own data. Sites using NLWeb can make
their content discoverable and accessible to platforms that support
MCP. NLWeb could play a similar role to HTML for the agentic web and
allow users to interact directly with web content in a rich, semantic
manner. The NLWeb project started with OpenAI, which was working on an
early version last November. 

 IPHONE 17 AIR BATTERY CAPACITY AND WEIGHT ALLEGEDLY REVEALED (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's iPhone 17 Air, which is expected to launch later this year,
will weigh approximately 145 grams. The 6.6-inch, 5.5 mm-thin device
will have a battery capacity of 2,800mAh and may use Apple's
power-efficient C1 modem. There have been mixed reports regarding the
iPhone 17 Air's potential battery performance, but Apple apparently
determined that 60% to 70% of users will be able to use the device for
a full day without needing to recharge throughout the day. The company
is reportedly planning to release a battery case as an optional
accessory to mitigate this problem.

 NVIDIA OPENS UP SPEEDY NVLINK INTERCONNECT TO CUSTOM CPUS, ASICS (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nvidia's NVLink Fusion, introduced at Computex this week, opens the
NVLink interconnect tech to non-Nvidia-designed accelerators. NVLink
enables multiple GPUs in a system or rack to behave like a single
accelerator with shared compute and memory resources. The technology
will be offered in two configurations: the first will be for
connecting custom CPUs to Nvidia GPUs, and the second involves using
NVLink to connect Grace and Vera CPUs to non-Nvidia accelerators. This
should theoretically open up the possibility of superchip-style
compute assemblies that feature any combination of CPUs and GPUs as
long as Nvidia technology is involved. 

 23ANDME AND ITS USER DATA WILL SOON BELONG TO A PHARMACEUTICAL GIANT
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 23andMe will be sold to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for $256 million.
The sale includes 23andMe's Total Health and Research Services
business and biobank of customer data and genetic samples. 23andMe
says that customer data is anonymized and stored genetic samples are
destroyed when users delete their accounts, but it is unclear how much
information is retained. Regeneron's co-founder said that the purchase
will further the company's large-scale genetics research into future
drugs and treatments. 23andMe has collected genetic samples and data
from more than 15 million customers.

 GITHUB COPILOT CODING AGENT IN PUBLIC PREVIEW (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Copilot coding agent lets developers delegate issues so they can
focus on the creative, complex, and high-impact work that matters
most. Developers simply assign issues to Copilot as they would another
developer, and Copilot will work in the background using a secure
cloud-based development environment. The agent will explore the
repository, make changes, and validate its work before it pushes.
Developers can ask Copilot to make changes to pull requests by leaving
comments. The agent excels in low-to-medium complex tasks in
well-tested codebases. 

 CLAUDE CODE SDK (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Anthropic's Claude Code SDK allows developers to programmatically
integrate Claude Code into their applications. It enables running
Claude Code as a subprocess. The SDK currently supports command-line
usage. TypeScript and Python SDKs are coming soon. This page provides
a guide on basic SDK usage.

 VIBE CODING IS REWRITING THE RULES OF TECHNOLOGY (20 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Vibe coding represents a fundamental reimagining of the software
development process. Instead of crafting lines of code, developers get
to focus on vision and creative direction. It has the potential to
transform technology development for the better - anyone with an idea
for how technology could solve a problem can create that solution
without specialized technical training. Vibe coding isn't just a
technical shift, it's a cultural one that challenges assumptions about
who gets to create technology and how that creation happens. 

 THERE'S NO FREE LUNCH AT APPLE (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Apple is known for not giving its employees free lunches - even Steve
Jobs paid for his own lunch. However, recently, the team working on
Apple Intelligence were given vouchers to eat for free, breeding
resentment among other teams. The team still shipped late. This
article looks at the multiple failures within Apple's AI efforts.
Apple may need to make some big changes to catch up, such as a big
acquisition. While it doesn't usually make such moves, the current
situation isn't typical - the company needs to let go of the past and
operate in the future.
