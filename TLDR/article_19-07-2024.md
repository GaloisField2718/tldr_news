 OPENAI DEBUTS MINI VERSION OF ITS MOST POWERFUL MODEL YET (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has launched a new AI model called GPT-4o mini. It is
available to free users. The 'o' in the name stands for 'omni',
hinting at the model's audio, video, and text capabilities. The model
will be made available to ChatGPT Enterprise users next week. 

 AMAZON PRIME DAY DRIVES U.S. ONLINE SALES TO RECORD $14.2 BILLION (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Online spending during this year's 48-hour Amazon Prime Day event was
up 11% year-over-year, with customers spending $14.2 billion. The
strong showing was driven by back-to-school shopping and an apparent
product refresh cycle. Consumer behaviors during the sale indicate a
shift to more conscious shopping and a preference for saving over
splurging.

 WHAM! NUCLEAR FUSION EXPERIMENT HITS NEW RECORD FOR MAGNET STRENGTH
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new fusion experiment has set a record for the strongest steady
magnetic field confining a plasma. Strong magnets are essential for
certain types of fusion power - for every doubling of the strength of
a magnetic field, the power output of one reactor design increases
16-fold. The team was able to produce a 17 tesla magnetic field, more
than twice as powerful as the high-resolution MRI scanners used to
image human brains. They are now working on more advanced magnet
designs. 

 A SCIENTIST TOOK A PSYCHEDELIC DRUG ‚Äî AND WATCHED HIS OWN BRAIN
'FALL APART' (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A study on psilocybin suggests that psychedelic drugs work by
disrupting certain brain networks, especially one that helps people
form a sense of space, time, and self. The study, which involved
scanning participants' brains with an MRI while under the influence of
the drug, showed that the drug caused populations of neurons usually
in synchrony to fall out of synchrony. The brain appears to respond to
this by entering a state of enhanced plasticity that can last for
weeks. The study hints at how psychedelic drugs could be used to treat
people with addiction, depression, or post-traumatic stress.

 GOTCHAS WITH SQLITE IN PRODUCTION (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 SQLite provides lower operational complexity. It is the best choice
for getting applications running on a single machine. However, SQLite
becomes less appealing if a project requires multiple machines, has a
write-heavy workload, or has long-running transactions. In these
cases, developers are better off using a more traditional database
like MySQL or Postgres. 

 PYTHON GRAPPLES WITH APPLE APP STORE REJECTIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Apple's macOS App Store is automatically rejecting apps that contain
the string 'itms-services' - the URL scheme for apps to ask Apple's
iTunes Store to install another app. The string exists in the urllib
parser in Python's standard library. The discovery of this issue led
to a discussion among Python developers about whether 'acceptable to
app stores' should be a design goal for CPython. The developers
decided to implement a `--with-app-store-compliance` configuration
option to remove the problematic code.

 META REPORTEDLY UNHAPPY WITH HOW MUCH MONEY ITS VR DIVISION BURNS (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Meta has told its AR/VR teams to cut spending by around 20%. The
division has lost $55 billion since 2019. The company is still aiming
to release a new Meta Quest 4 headset, a Quest Pro sequel, and new AR
glasses in the next three years. Meta has been shifting its focus over
to AI. It is gearing up to release its Llama 400B AI model by the end
of the month. 

 APPLE TV+ WILL SOON GET A LOT MORE MOVIES MADE BY STUDIOS OTHER THAN
APPLE (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple is in talks with major studios to bring more movies to Apple
TV+, expanding and extending the service's appeal. The company's
previous experiments with licensing movies and making them available
for limited runs seem to have gone well. While Apple has found some
success in terms of series, it has struggled to make as much of an
impact with its movies. Apple TV+ accounted for $23.9 billion, more
than half the revenue generated by iPhone hardware sales, in the
second quarter of this year.
