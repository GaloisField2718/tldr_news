 GOOGLE GOES ‚ÄúOPEN AI‚Äù WITH GEMMA, A FREE, OPEN-WEIGHTS CHATBOT
FAMILY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's new family of AI language models, Gemma, are free
open-weights models built on technology similar to Gemini. Gemma
models can run locally on a desktop or laptop computer. There are two
models, one with 2 billion parameters and the other with 7 billion.
Each model has pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants available.
Google claims the 7 billion parameter model outperforms Meta's Llama 2
7B and 13B models on several benchmarks in math, Python code
generation, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning tasks. This
is Google's first significant open large language model release since
OpenAI's ChatGPT was revealed in late 2022. 

 75K LOYAL REDDITORS CAN SNAG SHARES BEFORE REDDIT GOES PUBLIC (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Reddit hopes to entice its users to become shareholders to help drive
change and make the market more fair to individual traders. 75,000 of
the most prolific Redditors will have the opportunity to buy shares
before trading starts when the company goes public later this year,
possibly as soon as March. The privilege is usually reserved for big
investors. Reddit announced its IPO in December 2021, when it was
valued at about $10 billion. The site experienced widespread protests
in June last year after it killed off many third-party apps by
charging for access to its API. Users are still questioning the
company's leadership over the decision.

 A PEEK AT INTEL‚ÄôS FUTURE FOUNDRY TECH (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Intel has revealed new chip technologies for its foundry customers.
The advances include more dense logic and a 16-fold increase in the
connectivity within 3D-stacked chips. Intel is moving from being a
company that only produces its own chips to becoming a foundry that
makes chips for others. This article takes a look at the new
technologies that Intel will be offering in its new business model. 

 NASA FACES A QUANDARY WITH ITS AUDACIOUS LUNAR CARGO PROGRAM (9
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Flying to the Moon is expensive, so NASA decided to reach out to
private companies for help. NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services
(CLPS) program originally aimed to launch its first missions by 2020.
Years later, the first vehicles are now ready. Astrobotic's Odysseus
lander will attempt to land on the Moon on Thursday. No private
company has successfully landed on the Moon yet. If the CLPS program
is successful, in a few years, NASA will have laid the foundation for
a highway to the Moon.

 READYSET (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 ReadySet is a transparent database cache for Postgres and MySQL. It
provides the performance and scalability of an in-memory key-value
store without requiring users to rewrite their apps or manually handle
cache invalidation. ReadySet can turn even the most complex SQL reads
into lightning-fast lookups. It keeps cached query results in sync
with databases automatically by utilizing the database's replication
stream. ReadySet can be used along with an existing ORM or database
client. 

 PARK UI (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Park UI contains components built on Ark UI that work for any
JavaScript or CSS framework. The components have sensible defaults
that can be easily customized. Park UI ships packages tailored for
each supported CSS framework, allowing developers to only install the
components they need. Examples for inspiration are available.

 I RAN A BACKGROUND CHECK ON A STARTUP (27 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Employers regularly run background checks on potential employees.
However, companies don't always make their history public - there's
only so much you can learn from career pages and recruiter emails.
This article presents an example of what a background check on an
employer might look like. The check goes through checking a company's
funding rounds, Glassdoor reviews, and court orders. Performing a
background check on a company can turn up interesting facts that could
help you decide whether you really want to work with them. 

 THE KILLER APP OF GEMINI PRO 1.5 IS VIDEO (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Gemini Pro 1.5 is an enormous upgrade for the Gemini series. The
model has a 1,000,000 token context size, much larger than Claude
2.1's 200,000 and gpt-4-turbo's 128,000 token context sizes. While the
model can still miss things and hallucinate incorrect details, it is
able to process and extract text information from short videos. This
article contains an example where Gemini Pro 1.5 is used to extract
book names from a short video.
