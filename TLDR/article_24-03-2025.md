 TESLA AIMING TO PRODUCE FIRST “LEGION” OF OPTIMUS ROBOTS THIS
2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla aims to start producing Optimus this year. The company plans to
produce enough parts to make 10,000 to 12,000 Optimus robots this year
and 50,000 units next year. The product is totally new, so Tesla's
measure of success is to produce at least 5,000 robots. The article
includes a video of Tesla's Q1 2025 All-Hands Meeting, during which
Elon Musk discusses the project. 

 APPLE WANTS TO TURN ITS WATCHES INTO WEARABLE AI (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple plans to turn the Apple Watch into an AI-infused wearable. It
is working on a version of the smartwatch equipped with cameras, which
will allow the device to do things like identify objects or translate
text in a picture. Apple has had issues with implementing AI features
and its past attempts at expanding the functionality of the Apple
Watch have not gone well. The company is reportedly close to ditching
a plastic version of the Apple Watch SE that was supposed to help
bring the price of the device down.

 1X WILL TEST HUMANOID ROBOTS IN ‘A FEW HUNDRED' HOMES IN 2025 (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 1X plans to start early tests of its Neo Gamma humanoid robot in up
to a few thousand homes by the end of 2025. The company will be
initially relying on teleoperators - customers will be able to decide
when a 1X employee can view Neo Gamma's surroundings. The in-home
tests will allow the company to collect data on how the robot operates
to create a dataset for training AI models and upgrading the robot's
capabilities. A video of the robot vacuuming carpet during a demo at a
show is available in the article. 

 POST 50: GOOD RESEARCH TAKES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR GOOD STRATEGIC
TAKES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Having a good research track record is evidence of good big-picture
takes about AGI, but it's weak evidence. Strategic thinking requires
different skills - people often conflate these skills, leading to
excessive deference to researchers without evidence of whether that
person is good at strategic thinking specifically. Having good
strategic takes is important and researchers should spend a fair
amount of time developing the skill. People should be skeptical about
people's strategic takes until they have proven they have the skill to
make good strategic takes.

 REVENGE OF THE JUNIOR DEVELOPER (32 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There will still be plenty of jobs in the software industry in the
future - just not the kind that involves writing code by hand. The
world is changing, so junior developers are adapting. Junior
developers have been far more eager to adopt AI than senior
developers. Developers who don't adopt the new technology have lost.

 THE STRUGGLE THAT MADE US IN WATERLOO (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The power in the software industry is transferring from the employee
to the employer, causing many seasoned professionals to question their
self-worth and students to worry. Being a student back amid the global
financial crisis was a stressful experience, with the pressures
causing many students to drop out every year. It didn't get easier for
students - they just got better at playing the game. Current students
need to stay strong and keep going. School can be challenging - the
experience will change you in ways you won't understand until much
later, but when you finally do, you'll look back and know it was worth
it. 

 META HAS REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH LLAMA AI MODEL HOSTS, FILING
REVEALS (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 While Mark Zuckerberg claims that selling access to Meta's Llama AI
models isn't in Meta's business model, the company does at least make
some money from the models through revenue-sharing agreements. A court
filing has revealed that Meta shares a percentage of the revenue that
companies hosting its Llama models generate from users. These
companies may include AWS, Nvidia, Databricks, Groq, Dell, Azure,
Google Cloud, and Snowflake.
