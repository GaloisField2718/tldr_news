annual report. OpenAI is listed as a competitor in AI offerings,
search, and news advertising. The companies have a long-term

 INTEL IS LAYING OFF OVER 15,000 EMPLOYEES AND WILL STOP
‚ÄòNON-ESSENTIAL WORK' (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Intel is downsizing its workforce by over 15 percent as part of a new
cost savings plan for 2025. The $10 billion cost saving plan will mean
a headcount reduction of greater than 15,000 roles. Intel plans to
reduce its R&D and marketing spending by billions each year through
2026, reduce capital expenditures by more than 20 percent this year,
restructure to stop non-essential work, and review all active projects
and equipment to make sure it's not spending too much. The company
recently reported a loss of $1.6 billion for Q2, which is
substantially more than the $437 million it lost the previous quarter.

 FULLY-AUTOMATIC ROBOT DENTIST PERFORMS WORLD'S FIRST HUMAN PROCEDURE
(4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 An AI-controlled autonomous robot has performed an entire dental
procedure on a human patient for the first time. The system uses a
hand-held 3D volumetric scanner that builds a detailed 3D model of the
mouth using optical coherence tomography, cutting X-ray radiation out
of the process. The robot surgeon plans out the operation after the
human dentist and patient agree on what needs to be done. It can
prepare a tooth for a dental crown in 15 minutes, a procedure that
usually takes two hours split into two visits. Video of the robot is
available in the article. 

 A PROTEIN CALLED REELIN KEEPS POPPING UP IN BRAINS THAT RESIST AGING
AND ALZHEIMER'S (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A key protein called Reelin appears to protect the brain from
Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging. Studies suggest that the
protein helps maintain thinking and memory in ailing brains. The
research has inspired efforts to develop a drug that boosts Reelin or
helps it function better. The discovery of Reelin was aided by the
cooperation of about 1,500 members of an extended Colombian family
that carries a gene that almost guarantees the development of
Alzheimer's in middle age.

 WHY CSV IS STILL KING (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CSV is simple, resilient, and seemingly impossible to kill off. The
standard developed naturally as a simple way to store data in tables
when storage was very limited. It has become crucial for business data
- companies use it to share financial data, import customer
information, and exchange data between different systems. While it has
its problems, the format will likely remain king, as its core
simplicity will keep it relevant for years to come.

 ZUCKERBERG SAYS META WILL NEED 10X MORE COMPUTING POWER TO TRAIN
LLAMA 4 THAN LLAMA 3 (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Meta believes it will need significantly more computing power to
train models in the future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's
second-quarter earnings call that he would rather risk building
capacity before it is needed rather than too late given the long lead
time for spinning up new inference projects. The company is
considering different data center projects, which may increase capital
expenditures in 2025. India is currently the largest market for Meta's
AI chatbot. 

 ELON MUSK'S LITTLE COMPANY TOWN IS GETTING A SCHOOL, IF REGULATORS
ALLOW IT (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Elon Musk plans to launch an experimental private school called Ad
Astra in September ahead of the 2024 to 2025 school year. Ad Astra
will be based in Bastrop, Texas, a rural community that has been
transformed into somewhat of a hub for several of Musk's companies.
Musk previously founded another school in 2014 after pulling five of
his children from public school. His nonprofit, the Foundation, plans
to eventually build a futuristic university in Texas. Ad Astra is now
accepting applications for kids between the ages of 3 and 9.
