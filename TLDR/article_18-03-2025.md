 OPENAI TO START TESTING CHATGPT CONNECTORS FOR GOOGLE DRIVE AND SLACK
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI plans to start testing ways for business customers to connect
apps to ChatGPT. It will soon begin beta testing a new feature called
ChatGPT Connectors that will allow ChatGPT Team subscribers to link
workspace Google Drive and Slack accounts to ChatGPT so the chatbot
can answer questions informed by content across those accounts. None
of the data synced from the apps will be used for training. The
company plans to expand the feature to other platforms like Microsoft
SharePoint and Box in the future. 

 IPHONE SALES AT RISK, BUT APPLE'S FIRST FOLDABLE IN 2026 WILL CHANGE
THAT (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple plans to launch its first foldable in 2026. Market expectations
for iPhone sales are lower due to the delay of the new Siri
experience, but the launch of a foldable may help the company recover
from weak demand for iPhones. At least one new foldable is targeted to
enter mass production in the second half of 2026. The first foldable
iPhone may cost more than $2,000 and look like an iPad mini when
unfolded. Apple is also working on a foldable device with an 18-inch
screen that could end up becoming a new Mac or iPad.

 BYD CONFIRMS NEW 1,000V ‘SUPER E-PLATFORM' CAPABLE OF FAST CHARGING
400KM IN 5 MINUTES (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 BYD has a new EV architecture that will enable charging parity with
gas station visits. The Super E-Platform promises 1,000 kW charge
speeds - double the current industry leaders. Most fast chargers on
the market can only reach about 350 kW and many of them are usually
more in the 200s. BYD has launched new Han L and Tang L models that
use the new fast-charging platform. The company plans to implement
over 4,000 ultra-fast charging stations around China. 

 RESEARCHERS ENGINEER BACTERIA TO PRODUCE PLASTICS (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 A team of Korean researchers has engineered a bacterial strain that
can make useful polymers starting with nothing but glucose for fuel.
The system can be tweaked to incorporate a huge range of chemicals
into a variety of polymers. The resulting plastic can be tuned across
many properties. There are still some issues, as the process doesn't
allow complete control over what gets added into the polymer - the
scientists couldn't stop enzymes from mixing random chemicals from the
cells' metabolism into the polymers - and the polymers still need to
be purified from the rest of the cell components before being used in
manufacturing.

 DISCORD LAUNCHES SDK TO HELP DEVELOPERS ENHANCE SOCIAL EXPERIENCES IN
THEIR GAMES (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The new Discord Social SDK is a free toolkit that allows developers
to enhance their games' social and multiplayer experiences by
leveraging Discord's social infrastructure. Developers will be able to
improve their in-game experiences for players regardless of whether
they have a Discord account. The social integrations include a unified
friends list and deep-linked game invites that enable players to
invite their friends to directly join their party or lobby. The SDK is
compatible with C++, Unreal Engine, and Unity and supports Windows 11+
and macOS - support for console and mobile is coming. 

 VERIFIABILITY IS THE LIMIT (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 There are many beliefs about the limits, usefulness, and potential of
large language models. Every piece of software needs to be 'correct',
which means that the software conforms to the intent of the creator.
The creator has to verify such conformance - it cannot be offloaded.
Verifiability is the limit that tells us what we can't implement via
large language models, and it cannot be solved with agentic
approaches.

 RIPPLING SUES DEEL, DEEL DENIES ‘ALL LEGAL WRONGDOING,' AND SLACK
IS THE MAIN WITNESS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 HR company Rippling has launched a lawsuit against Deel, another big
player in the industry, alleging racketeering, misappropriation of
trade secrets, tortious interference, unfair competition, and aiding
and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. Deel has denied the
allegations, saying the lawsuit was an attempt to shift attention away
from Rippling after it was accused of violating sanctions law in
Russia. A lot of the evidence for Rippling's claims is based on Slack
activity. 

 ADOBE ANALYTICS: TRAFFIC TO U.S. RETAIL WEBSITES FROM GENERATIVE AI
SOURCES JUMPS 1,200 PERCENT (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Generative AI chat interfaces are changing how consumers act online.
Adobe has issued a report that shows how generative AI sources are
directing a significant surge of traffic to US websites. Generative AI
has been embraced by users as a shopping assistant. Shoppers say
AI-powered chat interfaces help shorten the time required for them to
receive information that is personalized to their needs. The
technology is causing businesses to rethink customer engagement,
especially as future AI agents will be able to handle more complex
tasks and make highly tailored recommendations.
