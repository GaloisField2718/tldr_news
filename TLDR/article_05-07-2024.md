 Apple is working on a new home accessory. The accessory's internal
identifier name suggests that it will receive Apple's upcoming A18
chip, which means it will have the power for Apple Intelligence. The
home accessory will likely run a software variant of tvOS. Apple may
be launching an updated Apple TV later this year. 

 A HACKER STOLE OPENAI SECRETS, RAISING FEARS THAT CHINA COULD, TOO (8
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A hacker gained access to OpenAI's internal messaging systems early
last year. They accessed details from discussions in an internal
online forum but did not get into the systems where the company houses
and builds its artificial intelligence. Details of the incident were
revealed to employees in April 2023. Executives decided not to share
the news publicly because no information about customers or partners
was stolen. It is believed that the hacker was a private individual
with no known ties to a foreign government. OpenAI did not inform the
FBI or anyone else in law enforcement about the incident.

 Japan Railway's new humanoid robot employee is being put to use for
maintenance work on the company's rail network. The 12-meter-high
robot can carry objects as heavy as 40kg, hold a brush to paint, and
use a chainsaw. Its current primary tasks are to trim tree branches
along rails and paint the metal frames that hold cables above trains.

 0X.TOOLS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 0x.tools is a set of utilities for analyzing application performance
on Linux. It allows users to measure individual thread level activity
and drill down into the CPU usage of any thread or the system as a
whole. 0x.tools enables users to be systematic in their
troubleshooting. Some of the tools work on over-decade-old Linux
kernels.

 APPLE M5 CHIP'S DUAL-USE DESIGN WILL POWER FUTURE MACS AND AI SERVERS
(1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Apple will reportedly use a more advanced System on Integrated Chip
(SoIC) technology for its M5 chips. SoIC technology allows for the
stacking of chips in a three-dimensional structure. It provides better
electrical performance and thermal management compared to traditional
two-dimensional chip designs. Apple intends to start mass producing
the chips in 2025 and 2026 for new Macs and AI cloud servers. The M5's
dual-use design is believed to be part of Apple's plans to vertically
integrate its supply chain for AI functionality across computers,
cloud servers, and software. 

 AGAINST INNOVATION TOKENS (21 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The idea of using innovation tokens to identify which technologies
are innovative implies that everyone knows which technologies are
innovative. It also assumes that innovative technologies are
inherently costly and that their supply should be restricted. This
model is reactionary and borders on anti-intellectualism. It is better
to look at whether using a particular technology will introduce a
boundary between two different technologies with different conceptual
models.
