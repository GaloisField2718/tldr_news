 The world might get an ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù energy source sooner than
later. And you have less than one month to invest in the company
making it: Infinity Fuel Cell & Hydrogen, Inc. [4] Their fuel cells
are like batteries that renew themselves. They've spent decades
inventing ways to supply power underwater and in space, acquiring
$50M+ in contracts to date with the US Navy [4], NASA, and major
commercial space partners. Now, they're aiming to bring their
innovation to areas like EVs and off-grid power. The final day to
invest is 10/25. Become an Infinity shareholder while you still can

 META'S NEW LIGHTWEIGHT AR PROTOTYPE SHOWS A FUTURE BEYOND BULKY VR
HEADSETS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mark Zuckerberg revealed a prototype of Meta's Orion AR glasses at
this year's Meta Connect keynote. While the 100g pair of see-through
augmented-reality glasses won't likely be ready for consumer release
anytime soon, the demo represents a new vision of lightweight,
wide-ranging, see-through smart glasses. Getting the glasses down to a
weight of 100 grams was a challenge - a small amount of processing is
done in a 'small puck' that connects wirelessly to the glasses. The
glasses use tiny projectors embedded into the arms that shoot light
into specially designed waveguides instead of a screen, creating a
holographic display that allows for a 70-degree field of view.
Pictures and more details are available in the article. 

 OPENAI CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING TO FOR-PROFIT, CTO MIRA MURATI AND
TWO TOP RESEARCH EXECS DEPART (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI's board is considering plans to restructure itself into a
for-profit business while still retaining its non-profit segment as a
separate entity. The structure will make investing more
straightforward and make it easier for OpenAI employees to realize
liquidity. OpenAI's Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati is leaving
the company after six and a half years. Research chief Bob McGrew and
Barret Zoph, a research vice-president, are also departing the
company.

 NASA SPACECRAFT TO PROBE POSSIBILITY OF LIFE IN EUROPA'S SALTY OCEAN
(36 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Jupiter's moon Europa possibly contains a liquid saltwater ocean that
may be potentially as welcoming to life as Earth's. In 2030, NASA's
Europa Clipper spacecraft will swoop past the moon in a series of
nearly 50 flybys to remotely probe the ocean in hopes of finding a
chemistry that could support life. It may even be capable of detecting
microbes directly. It will be a habitability mission rather than a
life search mission. If Europa is found to be habitable to life, it
could fundamentally change the definition of a habitable zone around a
star as it would mean that all that is required for life is ice and
gravitational tides. 

 'WORLD-FIRST' INDOOR VERTICAL FARM TO PRODUCE 4M POUNDS OF BERRIES A
YEAR (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The world's first farm to grow indoor, vertically farmed berries at
scale is opening in Richmond, VA. The farm is designed to produce more
than four million pounds of strawberries while using a fraction of the
land needed for traditional strawberry production. It will not be
subject to seasonal and environmental factors that limit yield. The
company aims for its strawberries to be on grocery store shelves by
early 2025.

 MARKETERS, HERE ARE 6 TAKEAWAYS FROM POSTING ON LINKEDIN FOR 30 DAYS
STRAIGHT (SPONSOR) [9] 

 LinkedIn demands strong hooks due to high competition, post reach
depends heavily on the algorithm, engagement boosts impressions but
doesn't always convert to followers, timing seems to be less important
than content quality, shorter posts perform best, and external links
may impact organic reach. Follow Dan for more marketing tips. [10] 

 WEBJSX (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 WebJSX is a minimal library for building web applications with JSX
and Web Components. It provides two core functions: createElement,
which creates virtual DOM elements using JSX, and applyDiff, which
efficiently applies changes to the real DOM by comparing virtual
nodes. Examples and an API reference are available. 

 SUMMARY OF ILYA SUTSKEVERS AI READING LIST (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A reading list shared on X earlier this year went somewhat viral due
to claims that it was originally compiled by OpenAI co-founder Ilya
Sutskever and part of onboarding at OpenAI. The combined contents of
this list amount to about 300,000 words of dense, technical text that
requires a decent investment in time and energy for self-study. This
post provides a condensed and structured summary of the readings to
capture the essential key points, context, and perspective gained,
free of mathematical notation. The list contains 27 reading items -
papers, blog posts, courses, one dissertation, and two book chapters -
all originally dating from 1993 to 2020.

 91% OF POLLED AMAZON STAFF UNHAPPY WITH RETURN-TO-OFFICE, 3-IN-4 WANT
TO JUMP SHIP (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A staff poll suggests that Amazon's recent return-to-office mandate
has not gone down well. Of the over 2,500 Amazon employees polled,
only nine percent said they were happy with the order. 73 percent are
now considering moving jobs. Amazon is reportedly having trouble
hiring staff since the policy was announced, with employees at other
companies agreeing that the policy meant Amazon was off their list of
potential employees.
