 10 YEARS AFTER FACEBOOK BOUGHT OCULUS, WHAT'S NEXT FOR META'S VR
PLANS? (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Smartwatches weren't even mainstream yet when Facebook bought Oculus
10 years ago. VR is still not massively adopted in 2024, but it has
gone mainstream several times. This article contains an overview of
where Meta is heading next with the Quest 3, AI, smart glasses, and AR
glasses. Meta is bringing its own generative AI features to its
Ray-Ban smart glasses later this month. The glasses will use their
onboard cameras to recognize things in the real world. 

 PHYSICISTS TAKE A MAJOR STEP TOWARD MAKING A NUCLEAR CLOCK (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Scientists were recently able to use a tabletop laser to bump an
atomic nucleus into a higher energy state, a feat that paves the path
towards creating the first nuclear clock. Nuclear clocks keep time
based on the inner workings of atomic nuclei. They could be more
simple and portable than atomic clocks. They could also be used to
test fundamental physics theories in new ways. Nuclear clocks are
based on different physics than atomic clocks, so comparing the two
types of timepieces could allow for new studies of fundamental
physics.

 DOTLOTTIE-RS (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 dotLottie-rs is a Rust implementation of the dotLottie player and its
related tools. It utilizes uniffi-rs to generate FFI bindings for
Kotlin, Swift, and WebAssembly (WASM) for use in native dotLottie
players. dotLottie-rs builds on the Lottie format, adding new
improvements and features like theming support, multi-animation
support, built-in interactivity powered by state machines, reduced
animation file sizes, and more. It brings consistency of playback and
dotLottie features across all platforms. 

 SIGNALS FOR TAILWIND CSS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Signals for Tailwind CSS is a plugin that utilizes style queries via
container queries to reactively enable custom states that can be
consumed by descendants in the DOM. It reduces development effort and
the need to compose a chain of variants. Signals for Tailwind CSS is
useful for simplifying the application of styles based on ancestor
states, improving developer experience with a more declarative API,
and reducing the need for complex selector chaining and arbitrary
targeting. Browser support for style queries is still limited, so
Signals for Tailwind CSS may not be suitable for projects that require
broad compatibility.

 ANATOMY OF A CREDIT CARD REWARDS PROGRAM (26 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Credit cards earn money in multiple different ways. One important
method is interchange, a fee paid by card-accepting businesses. The
fee is split between various parties in the credit card ecosystem for
marketing. Credit card issuers offer rewards cards so customers use
their rails and then compete with each other for 'share of wallet' by
bidding with interchange. Not every card is a reward card due to
different card applications and features, regulations, collusion, and
other reasons. This article explains how credit card rewards programs
work and the systems that work together that make them profitable.
