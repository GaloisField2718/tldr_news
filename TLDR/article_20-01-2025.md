 TIKTOK BEGINS RESTORING SERVICE FOR U.S. USERS AFTER TRUMP COMMENTS
(5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TikTok is restoring service to US users after Trump posted to Truth
Social calling for it to remain available so he can broadcast his
inauguration. Trump said that he will issue an executive order to
extend the period of time before the law banning the platform takes
effect so that his administration can make a deal to protect US
national security. There will be no liability for any company that
helped keep TikTok from going dark. Some Republicans have made
statements that appear to contradict Trump on how things might play
out, saying that he will try to force a true divestiture of the social
media platform. 

 PERPLEXITY AI MAKES A BID TO MERGE WITH TIKTOK U.S. (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Perplexity AI has submitted a bid to ByteDance to create a new merged
entity that will combine Perplexity AI, TikTok US, and new capital
partners. The new structure would allow for most of ByteDance's
existing investors to retain their equity stakes. Any potential
transaction between Perplexity AI and ByteDance will likely take
months to complete. ByteDance has publicly implied that it will not
sell TikTok US, but Perplexity AI believes that it might be interested
in a merger.

 OPENAI IS TRYING TO EXTEND HUMAN LIFE, WITH HELP FROM A LONGEVITY
STARTUP (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI trained a new AI model called GPT-4b micro with a longevity
science startup called Retro Biosciences. Retro, which is backed by
Sam Altman, is trying to extend the human lifespan by 10 years. The
GPT-4b micro model tries to re-engineer proteins that can turn human
skin cells into young-seeming stem cells. It is the first model by
OpenAI custom-built for biological research. OpenAI and Retro plan to
release research on the model and its outputs. 

 BEHIND THE CURTAIN — COMING SOON: PH.D.-LEVEL SUPER-AGENTS (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are rumors that a top AI company will be announcing Ph.D.-level
super-agents in the coming week. OpenAI's Sam Altman has scheduled a
closed-door briefing with US government officials on January 30. The
developments may explain why top AI developers have been talking
publicly about AI replacing mid-level software engineers and other
human jobs this year. A super-agent breakthrough could turn generative
AI into a true replacement for human workers. While the AI world is
full of hype, sources say that the coming advancement is significant.

 SO YOU WANT TO BUILD YOUR OWN DATA CENTER (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post discusses how Railway built out its physical
infrastructure. Railway used Google Cloud when it started, but the
platform caused a multitude of problems that posed an existential risk
to its business, so Railway decided to build its own data centers. The
Railway Metal project kicked off last year with its first site in
California. The company is currently building three more data center
regions. 

 EVOLVING GITHUB ISSUES (PUBLIC PREVIEW) (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GitHub has released sub-issues, issue types, and advanced search for
issues to everyone. It has also updated the issues frontend to enable
developers to work faster. Sub-issues allow developers to break down
and organize issues within a parent-child hierarchy. Issue types let
developers classify and manage issues with a shared and consistent
language across all repositories in an organization. Advanced search
enables complex filters so that developers can find the exact set of
issues they are looking for.

 WHY TECH COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON, GOOGLE, AND TSMC ARE FLOCKING TO
PHOENIX (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Phoenix has been growing into an innovation hub over the past several
decades. It has become the epicenter for semiconductor manufacturing
and testing self-driving cars and drones. The city offers a favorable
business environment, an ecosystem of companies, a close proximity to
a university with a strong engineering program, and plenty of
available talent. Technology companies are flocking to the city to
capitalize on its perks. 

 BALANCE OF POWER SHIFTS BACK TOWARD BOSSES (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While the job market looks as strong as ever, big companies are
tightening remote-work policies, shrinking travel budgets, and cutting
back on benefits. The balance of power between employers and employees
has shifted as the labor market has gone from white-hot to merely
solid. The power shift is evident across most of the labor market, but
it is most prominent in white-collar roles. While the shift in
leverage was displayed in layoffs and wage cuts in the past, it is now
more subtle, often seen through changes to working conditions.
