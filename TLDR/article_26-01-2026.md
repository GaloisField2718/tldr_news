 PRODUCTION INFERENCE FOR OPEN-SOURCE LLMS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Nebius Token Factory [4] is built for teams running open-source LLMs
in real products. We deliver managed inference with explicit control
over execution paths: speculative decoding, cache-aware routing, and
post-training tuned to real traffic. Predictable tail latency, stable
cost, and production-grade systems for AI that actually ships.

 INSIDE APPLE'S AI SHAKE-UP AND ITS PLANS FOR TWO NEW VERSIONS OF SIRI
(18 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's AI efforts have resulted in a Google partnership, management
changes, and two new versions of Siri. The company had considered
partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic, but Anthropic wanted too much
money, and OpenAI was actively poaching Apple engineers. Google was
willing to agree to a financial structure Apple deemed reasonable, and
its technology had improved significantly in recent months. Apple is
planning an announcement for the second half of February that will
include demonstrations of the new Siri. 

 CHATGPT'S LEAD SHRINKS AS GEMINI SURGES IN AI TRAFFIC WAR (9 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 ChatGPT's worldwide traffic declined in January as Google's Gemini's
traffic increased. The shift marks a significant acceleration of
competitive pressure. ChatGPT had a commanding share last year, but
its dominance eroded over the course of the year. Gemini's growth
reflects Google's systematic integration across its services and
devices, which creates a distribution advantage through existing
userbases.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 BLUE ORIGIN MAKES IMPRESSIVE STRIDES WITH REUSE—NEXT LAUNCH WILL
REFLY BOOSTER (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The next launch of Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket will carry an AST
SpaceMobile large communications satellite into low-Earth orbit. The
mission will use a refurbished booster from New Glenn's second
mission. It will launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station no
earlier than late February. Blue Origin's turnaround time for the
rocket (less than four months) is impressive, even for a
well-capitalized program. 

 HARMFUL CHOLESTEROL LEVELS CUT IN HALF WITH ONE-TIME GENE EDITING
DRUG IN EARLY TRIAL (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new experimental drug uses CRISPR to manipulate a single gene in
the liver that normally boosts cholesterol levels. The approach works
after one dose, helping people lower their levels of cholesterol and
other fats in the blood permanently. While a Phase 1 clinical trial
showed that the treatment is effective, its long-term safety is
unknown. There are already safe and effective medications that can
control cholesterol and fats, but patients tend to stop using them
within a year due to side effects.

 GAS TOWN'S AGENT PATTERNS, DESIGN BOTTLENECKS, AND VIBECODING AT
SCALE (32 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Gas Town is a provocative piece of speculative design, but its design
is too poorly thought through to persist. The problems with Gas Town
will undoubtedly show up in the next generation of development tools.
Thoughtful design, critical thinking, user research, and planning and
coordination within teams will become more important as the pace of
software development speeds up. The most valuable tools will help
people think more clearly, plan more carefully, and keep the quality
bar high. 

 CLAUDE CODE TEAMMATETOOL - SOURCE CODE ANALYSIS (12 MINUTE READ) [12]


 TeammateTool is an existing-but-hidden functionality found in the
Claude Code v2.1.19 binary. While it is fully implemented, it is gated
behind feature flags. The tool could potentially be used to review PRs
through multiple perspectives, build complete features with
specialized agents for each layer, investigate a production bug from
multiple angles, and more. This post documents what has been
discovered about the feature.

 THE WARNER BROS. BIDDING WAR IS OVER (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Netflix has agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and
streaming business in an all-cash deal for $27.75 a share. The deal
has been unanimously approved by Warner Bros.' board, and shareholders
will vote on it in the next couple of months. The deal could be
blocked by regulators, and Paramount could still increase its offer,
but it previously said that the last bid was final. 

 TESLA KILLS AUTOPILOT, LOCKS LANE-KEEPING BEHIND $99/MONTH FEE (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tesla will start to charge $99 per month for its Full Self-Driving
(FSD) subscription starting on February 14. The capability can be
bought for a one-time fee of $8,000 until then. The $99 per month
price will rise as FSD's capabilities improve. Tesla's falling profit
margins, declining sales, and loss of emissions credits may be pushing
the company to find other sources of regular income.
