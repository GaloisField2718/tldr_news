 GOOGLE GOES “AGENTIC” WITH GEMINI 2.0'S AMBITIOUS AI AGENT
FEATURES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google has unveiled Gemini 2.0, the next generation of its AI model
family. Gemini 2.0 Flash, the smallest model of the family in terms of
parameter count, launches today through Google's developer platforms.
It can generate text, images, and speech while processing multiple
types of input including text, images, audio, and video, but its image
generation and text-to-speech features will remain limited to early
access partners until January 2025. Google plans to integrate the
technology into products like Android Studio, Chrome DevTools, and
Firebase. 

 THE VISION PRO'S ULTRAWIDE MAC DISPLAY IS VERY CLOSE TO BEING A
KILLER APP (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The visionOS 2.2 update upgrades Mac screen mirroring on the Apple
Vision Pro with a curved and sharper display. There are now three
screen options - Standard, Wide, and Ultrawide. The Ultrawide mode can
display resolutions of up to 10240 x 2880. The update makes the Vision
Pro more than a personal movie theater.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 WHY IT'S TIME TO GET OPTIMISTIC ABOUT SELF-DRIVING CARS (10 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Self-driving cars are now ready for prime time, with robotaxis
leading the charge. There is evidence that the industry is making
progress on overlapping technologies that make adoption possible. This
article looks at the adoption of self-driving cars, robotaxis, public
perceptions of the technology, and the future of self-driving cars.
The regulatory environment will determine how long it takes for
markets to adopt self-driving technology. It will still likely be a
couple of decades before consumers are buying self-driving cars in
meaningful numbers. 

 THE CASE AGAINST GOOGLE'S CLAIMS OF “QUANTUM SUPREMACY”: A VERY
SHORT INTRODUCTION (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google Quantum's claims should be approached with caution,
particularly those of an extraordinary nature. Its supremacy claims in
the past have been refuted by several groups. This article looks at
Google's 2019 experiment to review its claims of quantum supremacy.
The methodology used in the experiment was flawed and the competition
in the space is a serious additional reason to not take Google's
assertions seriously.

PROGRAMMING, DESIGN & DATA SCIENCE

 IS MANUAL TESTING THE ROOT CAUSE OF YOUR SLOW RELEASES? (SPONSOR) [9]


 Every dev team wants to ship faster. But when E2E testing takes hours
to run, everything slows down. The alternative? Ditch manual testing
and try QA Wolf [10]. Run 100% of your test suite in parallel with
pass/fail results within 3 minutes, and no cap on test runs. Test
constantly. Deploy continuously. Start here [11] 

 THE DEATH OF THE STUBBORN DEVELOPER (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The circuit that lets junior developers grow into senior developers
is broken, or at least damaged. Many tasks can now be automated, so
companies don't need as many junior contributors. Developers who don't
adopt chat-based programming as their primary modality will be left
behind. 

 SETUP-UCACHER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 ucacher is a CLI tool that tracks which files are accessed by
commands, skips unnecessary executions, and restores cached outputs
when possible. It brings faster feedback loops, simplified caching and
skipping, enhanced precision, resource efficiency, scalability for
complex workflows, and more. Using ucacher can result in significantly
reduced execution times.

 A LETTER TO OPEN-SOURCE MAINTAINERS (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 People contributing to open source are under no obligation to stay in
a project. The best thing to do is to make sure projects can continue
to operate smoothly even after you leave. The license maintainers
choose will influence how their project is utilized and how it
develops, so maintainers should fully understand the implications of
each license before making a decision. It's okay to step away from
projects if they don't make you happy.
