INVEST IN SUPERCOMPUTERS POWERING THE AI BOOM FOR 30-50% ANNUALIZED
RETURNS (SPONSOR) [4]

InfraHub Compute is now allowing the public to buy a range of
GPU-accelerated servers. These servers are plugged into the InfraHub
Compute cloud API network supporting over 45 cloud resellers and
distributors globally. 

This offering is the first of its kind in the world. [4] Previously,
opportunities like this were only available to Big Tech companies and
hyperscalers. InfraHub Compute is already managing large volumes of
infrastructure globally that are driving returns today and is now
opening the door to private investors to own their own GPUs powering
the AI gold rush, an industry that is expected to reach $1.8 Trillion
by 2030.

 IPHONE USERS CAN NOW SET WHATSAPP AS THEIR DEFAULT CALLING AND
TEXTING APP (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 iPhone users on WhatsApp version 25.8.74 have the option to choose
WhatsApp as their default app for calls and text messages. The setting
can be changed in Settings > Apps > Default Apps and then selecting
the Messaging and Calling options. The feature was introduced in iOS
18.2. A screenshot of the options menu to enable the feature is
available in the article. 

 META DEBUTS FRIENDS TAB (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta has introduced a Friends tab on Facebook to revive the original
spirit of the social networking app. The Facebook Friends tab is
designed to show users the latest posts from their friends instead of
recommended content. It is now available in the US and Canada - there
is no word on when it will debut in other countries.

 PARALYSED MAN STANDS AGAIN AFTER RECEIVING ‚ÄòREPROGRAMMED' STEM
CELLS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scientists at Keio University in Tokyo injected neural stem cells
into four patients to treat spinal cord injuries - one patient, who
was previously paralyzed, can now stand on his own. Another patient
can move their arms and legs, but the remaining two did not show
substantial improvements. While trials have shown that the therapy is
safe, it has so far had mixed results. Preliminary analysis of the
data suggests that the treatment works, but larger trials will be
needed. 

 SCIENTISTS JUST TRANSPLANTED A PIG LIVER INTO A PERSON FOR THE FIRST
TIME (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A Chinese team has successfully implanted a genetically modified pig
liver into a human. The organ remained functional until the end of the
experiment 10 days later - there were no signs of rejection or
inflammation. The pig liver is designed to be a stop-gap measure
rather than a full replacement. It can keep patients temporarily alive
until a human donor organ becomes available or the patient's own liver
recovers.

 FRAGMENTED TOOLS = FRAGMENTED TEAMS (SPONSOR) [9] 

 As an IT expert, you're no stranger to solving cross-departmental
technical difficulties. But how many problems can be resolved by
simply moving from siloed to centralized project management? This
Atlassian playbook [9] offers strategies to identify + address
inefficiencies, foster lasting cross-departmental alignment, and
manage the roll out to build tangible results. Download the guide. [9]


 OPEN SOURCE DEVS ARE FIGHTING AI CRAWLERS WITH CLEVERNESS AND
VENGEANCE (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sites hosting free and open source projects share most of their
infrastructure publicly, so they tend to have fewer resources than
commercial products. Many AI bots don't honor the Robots Exclusion
Protocol robot.txt file, hide behind other IP addresses, and pretend
to be other users, making it difficult to block them. Anubis is a
reverse proxy proof-of-work check that must be passed before requests
are allowed to hit a server - it blocks bots but lets through browsers
operated by humans. It has been popular among the FOSS community as
many projects are experiencing the same issue. 

 HOW TO WRITE BLOG POSTS THAT DEVELOPERS READ (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The biggest mistake software bloggers make is meandering - Internet
attention spans are short. Readers are looking for relevant material
that benefits them, so try to show readers you're writing for them and
make it clear how your article will benefit them within the first
three sentences. This article teaches techniques that help blog posts
succeed and discusses pitfalls that cause some blogs to languish in
obscurity. Many errors, once recognized, are easy to fix.

 SCARCITY AND ABUNDANCE IN 2025 (20 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Consumers adopt a new S-curve when they are both overserved by what
exists already and also underserved by the existing solution - and
like the new thing because it's cheaper and better. Right now, code is
capital, but going forward, the true capital asset will be big models
and chips - things that you can finance and rent. We are now solidly
in the agent S-curve - this will change how we think about software
businesses and their profit potential. 

 APPLE NEEDS A SNOW SEQUOIA (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Snow Leopard was an update released two years after macOS Leopard
that added very little and took a lot away. It was one of the most
solid software releases Apple has ever put out. Snow Leopard improved
the underlying system while shrinking it in size. Apple's latest
releases are screaming for such a reset - they feel like software
developed by people who don't actually use that software. Snow
Leopard's clean-up paved the way for years of solid, reliable upgrades
- spring cleaning would make the Mac, iPhone, and iPad really shine.
