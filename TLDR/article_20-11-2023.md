 A TIMELINE OF SAM ALTMAN‚ÄôS FIRING FROM OPENAI ‚Äî AND THE FALLOUT
(6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sam Altman was fired as CEO of OpenAI late Friday. The company's
president and co-founder Greg Brockman and three senior OpenAI
researchers resigned following Altman's departure. The situation is
fast-moving. This article presents a timeline to make it easier to
follow what's happening. 

 SPACEX LAUNCHES STARSHIP FOR THE SECOND TIME, GOING FARTHER THAN EVER
BEFORE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX flew Starship for the second time on November 18. While both
the Super Heavy booster and the Starship upper stage had to be blown
up mid-air, the test was still a huge success for SpaceX. It appears
that the new water deluge system successfully protected the launch
infrastructure. The hot staging separation technique was also
successful. A video of the test is available in the article.

 SCIENTISTS 3D PRINT A ROBOTIC HAND WITH HUMAN-LIKE BONES AND TENDONS
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 One of the reasons robots seem to move differently from living
creatures is due to their lack of bones and flexible tissues.
Researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and
US-based startup Inkbit have figured out how to 3D print a robotic
hand with an internal structure composed of human-like bones,
ligaments, and tendons. The technique can create robots that
outperform hard robots in terms of flexibility and overcome the design
and scale-related issues faced by soft robots. A picture of the
3D-printed robot hand is available in the article. 

 WHY SUPERCONDUCTOR RESEARCH IS IN A ‚ÄòGOLDEN AGE‚Äô ‚Äî DESPITE
CONTROVERSY (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Superconductivity research is enjoying somewhat of a renaissance
fueled in part by the new capabilities of computer simulations to
predict the existence and properties of undiscovered materials.
Scientists have unearthed several families of materials over the past
few years that could have revolutionary properties. This article
covers some of the history behind superconductivity research and the
current state of the field.

 ALL OF THE WRITING I DID IN A WEEK AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEER (7 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Empathy and communication are less obvious skills that are helpful
for working as a software engineer. One of the ways software engineers
communicate is through writing. This article takes a look at all of
the writing that a software engineer working at the Cloud Gateway team
at Netflix does in a single week. In a week, the engineer wrote zero
emails, a few dozen lines of code, a handful of Jira tickets, a couple
of investigation and debugging docs, a few technical docs, and
hundreds of Slack messages. An ergonomic keyboard is a very worthwhile
investment.

 A TIMELINE OF THE OPENAI BOARD (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI's board has undergone numerous changes over the years,
especially recently. These changes weren't big news, so they didn't
spark the concerns that they maybe should have. This blog post goes
through the Internet Archive and OpenAI's non-profit filings to try to
make sense of OpenAI's governance. It attempts to chronicle the
composition of OpenAI's board, point out conflicts, and show what led
to Sam Altman being fired. It should be noted that the people involved
in this act of corporate governance are roughly the same people trying
to position themselves to govern policy on artificial intelligence. 

 HERE IS HOW FAR WE ARE TO ACHIEVING AGI, ACCORDING TO DEEPMIND (6
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The path to achieving artificial general intelligence remains a topic
of debate among scientists. A team of scientists from Google DeepMind
has proposed a new framework for classifying the capabilities and
behavior of AGI systems and their precursors. It is critical for the
AI research community to explicitly reflect on what it means when
discussing AGI. This article explores the framework, which includes
criteria for measuring artificial intelligence, a matrix that measures
performance and generality, and another matrix for measuring autonomy
and risk.
