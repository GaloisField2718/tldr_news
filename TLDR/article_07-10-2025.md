 🚀 FASTER MOBILE APP RELEASES WITH 100% PARALLEL AUTOMATED QA
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf [5] gets mobile apps to 80% automated test coverage in weeks
[6]. They create and maintain your test suite in Appium (no vendor
lock-in) — and provide unlimited, 100% parallel test runs [7] with
zero flakes.

✅ QA cycles reduced from hours to less than 15 minutes

✅ Tests run on real iOS devices and Android emulators

✅ Flake-free runs, no false positives

✅ Human-verified bug reports

No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No more bugs
reaching production.

 OPENAI LAUNCHES APPS INSIDE OF CHATGPT (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ChatGPT users can now access interactive applications from companies
like Booking.com, Spotify, Figma, and Canva right inside the
conversation. OpenAI is trying to build an ecosystem of apps that can
be launched directly in ChatGPT's responses, letting users call up
third-party tools in their conversations. It has launched a preview of
its Apps SDK for developers to start building apps. OpenAI says the
new system is built using the Model Context Protocol, which allows
developers to connect data sources to AI systems. 

 OPENAI, AMD ANNOUNCE MASSIVE COMPUTING DEAL, MARKING NEW PHASE OF AI
BOOM (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI and AMD have announced a multibillion-dollar partnership to
collaborate on data centers running on AMD processors. OpenAI has
committed to purchasing 6 gigawatts worth of AMD chips starting with
the MI450 chip next year. The deal is AMD's biggest win against
Nvidia's dominance in the artificial intelligence space. OpenAI plans
to use the AMD chips for inference functions.

STARLINK RIVALS (28 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 SpaceX has signed a $17 billion deal to buy spectrum licenses from
EchoStar. The deal will help Starlink satellites deliver better
service to smartphones. SpaceX will acquire EchoStar's AWS-4 and
H-block spectrum licenses, giving it the rights to 50 MHz of spectrum
in the 1.9 and lower 2 GHz spectrum bands. The spectrum will allow
SpaceX to provide phone, text, and broadband services from space to
mobile users globally. 

 DISCOVERY OF CELLS THAT KEEP IMMUNE RESPONSES IN CHECK WINS MEDICINE
NOBEL PRIZE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi were awarded the
2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work in the
discovery of specialized immune cells that keep potentially harmful
immune responses in check. These regulatory T cells play a key role in
peripheral immune tolerance, a non-central process that allows the
immune system to balance its response. The discovery has opened up new
lines of research into peripheral immune tolerance. Researchers are
now working on manipulating T cells so that they can't protect
cancerous tumors, engineering them to treat autoimmune diseases, and
recruiting them to protect transplanted organs and tissues.

 OpenZL is a novel data compression framework that delivers high
compression ratios while preserving high speed. It takes descriptions
of data and builds specialized and optimized compressors. OpenZL is
designed for engineers who deal with large quantities of specialized
data sets that require high speed for their processing pipelines. It
consists of a core library and tools to generate specialized
compressors, all compatible with a single universal decompressor.

 US V. GOOGLE: WHAT EACH SIDE ARGUED FOR FIXING GOOGLE'S AD TECH
MONOPOLY (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Justice Department and Google spent two weeks arguing over how to
address Google's illegal monopoly in advertising software. The
government argued that the only way to end Google's dominance in ad
tech is to force a breakup and make Google sell the software that
connects the buyers and sellers of ad space. Google says that the
proposal was too complicated to pull off without harming publishers
and instead proposed that the company make its systems work better
with products produced by its competitors. The judge presiding over
the case will reach a decision in the coming months. 

 ELON MUSK GAMBLES BILLIONS IN MEMPHIS TO CATCH UP ON AI (18 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 xAI is preparing to build a new plant in Memphis capable of
generating over a gigawatt of electricity to power a
million-square-foot data center that is also under development nearby.
The Colossus data center houses over 200,000 Nvidia chips and powers
the technology behind Grok, xAI's AI chatbot. xAI is close to
finishing another bigger facility called Colossus 2. Colossus 2 will
have a total of 550,000 chips and cost tens of billions of dollars.
