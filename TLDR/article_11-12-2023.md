 üòò KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [5] 

 Traditional QA solutions take years to scale, and high test coverage
is never guaranteed. Consider QA Wolf [5] - a new approach to getting
80% test coverage in just 4 months.
They‚Äôll build and maintain your test suite in Playwright (no vendor
lock-in, you own the code) + include unlimited parallel test runs on
their infrastructure. And they guarantee zero flakes [5].

‚úîÔ∏è¬†No more manual e2e testing

‚úîÔ∏è¬†No more QA bottlenecks

‚úîÔ∏è¬†No more bugs reaching your customers

‚úîÔ∏è¬†Multiple customer case studies calling out savings of
$200k+/year [5] in QA engineering and infrastructure costs.

 APPLE CUTS OFF BEEPER MINI‚ÄôS ACCESS AFTER LAUNCH OF SERVICE THAT
BROUGHT IMESSAGE TO ANDROID (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Beeper Mini, an app that brought iMessage to Android, recently
experienced an outage. It appeared that Apple found a way to make the
app stop functioning. The service is now back online. Apple claims
that the app poses significant risks to user security and privacy.
Beeper claims that its service increases iPhone security as without
it, texts would be sent to Android devices unencrypted. 

 THE REAL RESEARCH BEHIND THE WILD RUMORS ABOUT OPENAI‚ÄôS Q* PROJECT
(15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's Q* model can reportedly perform math on the level of
grade-school students. While Q* might not be the crucial breakthrough
that will lead to artificial general intelligence, it might be an
important step towards an AI with general reasoning abilities. This
article takes a look at the area of AI math research and explains why
step-by-step reasoning techniques designed for math problems could
have much broader applications. Building a general reasoning engine
will require a way for language models to learn new abstractions that
go beyond their training data and have these evolving abstractions
influence the model's choices as it explores the space of possible
solutions.

SCIENCE & FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY

 WHY SCIENTISTS ARE MAKING TRANSPARENT WOOD (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Transparent wood could soon find uses as super-strong screens for
smartphones, glowing light fixtures, and structural features like
color-changing windows. The material outperforms plastic and glass in
tests measuring how easily materials fracture or break under pressure.
It is a far better insulator than glass, so windows made out of the
material could help buildings retain heat or keep it out. For now,
transparent wood still has a higher environmental impact than glass,
but scaling up manufacturing and embracing greener production schemes
could help make it more sustainable. 

 FDA APPROVES FIRST CRISPR THERAPY (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The FDA has approved two gene therapies for treating sickle cell
disease. These treatments have been shown to be highly effective at
preventing vaso-occlusive events and crises. One of the treatments,
the first CRISPR/Cas9 therapy approved in the US, turns on the
production of fetal hemoglobin to replace deformed red blood cells.
The other therapy uses a Lentiviral vector to insert the genetic code
for a modified type of hemoglobin designed to be anti-sickling.

 MEDIA QUERIES IN HTML VIDEO (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article demonstrates how to serve videos using some of the
features used for serving content based on user preferences and
accessibility features. It presents alternate versions of a video for
assorted media queries. Each example embeds the video with its
alternate version, shows the HTML code used, and provides the
alternate version alone. The examples are designed so developers can
compare and confirm whether changes made to their browsers, systems,
or within dev tools were successful. 

 FRANKENPHP V1.0 IS HERE (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 FrankenPHP is a modern PHP application server that can create a
production-grade PHP server with just one command. It has native
support for Symphony, Laravel, WordPress, and more. Most popular PHP
extensions should work with FrankenPHP.

 THE QUIET PLAN TO MAKE THE INTERNET FEEL FASTER (22 MINUTE READ) [12]


 A new internet standard called L4S could significantly lower the
amount of time we spend waiting for things to load. Many Big Tech
companies are on board with the plan, which could help developers
create applications that currently aren't possible. The standard
allows packets to inform devices whether they experienced congestion
on their journey, allowing devices to start making adjustments
immediately to keep congestion from getting worse and potentially
eliminate it altogether. It keeps data flowing as fast as possible and
gets rid of the disruptions and mitigations that can add latency with
other systems. 

 IS THE TEXAS BOOM TOWN OF AUSTIN LOSING ITS LUSTER? (5 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Investors and startup founders flocked to Austin during the COVID-19
pandemic due to its lower cost of living, hip lifestyle, and
business-friendly environment. Some are now leaving or looking to
leave the city. The weather and economy were not as favorable as
they'd expected. This article looks at a few of the companies that are
leaving and the reasons why.
