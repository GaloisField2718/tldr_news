 OPENAI NEARS LAUNCH OF AI AGENT TOOL TO AUTOMATE TASKS FOR USERS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI agent codenamed 'Operator' that
will be able to use a computer to take actions on users' behalf. It
plans to release the tool as a research preview in January. OpenAI has
been working on several agent-related research projects. The one
nearest to completion is a general-purpose tool that executes tasks in
a web browser. OpenAI and its competitors are moving towards agents as
they are seeing diminishing returns from their costly efforts to
develop more advanced AI models. 

 AMAZON DEBUTS DISCOUNT STORE WITH EVERYTHING UNDER $20 TO TAKE ON
TEMU AND SHEIN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Amazon has rolled out a new storefront that features items priced
below $20. Amazon Haul, created to fend off competition from Temu and
Shein, is accessible through the company's mobile app. Shoppers get
free delivery on orders over $25. Amazon will be screening Haul
products to make sure they're safe, authentic, and comply with
regulatory requirements. The company will not accept returns on items
$3 or less. Items on Haul will be imported directly from manufacturers
in China.

 SUPERHUMAN VISION LETS ROBOTS SEE THROUGH WALLS, SMOKE WITH NEW
LIDAR-LIKE EYES (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 PanoRadar is a system created by researchers at the University of
Pennsylvania that converts basic radio waves into rich 3D views,
allowing robots to see beyond traditional sensor limits. The device
processes radio waves using AI algorithms, making it possible for
robots to precisely navigate through challenging situations and
obstructions where conventional sensors are inadequate. PanoRadar
could be used to complement existing sensing technologies to develop
more reliable multi-modal perception systems for robots. A video
explaining how the technology works is available in the article. 

 NEW STUDY ON MOONS OF URANUS RAISES CHANCE OF LIFE (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Uranus and its five biggest moons may have oceans - the moons may
even be capable of supporting life. Much of what we know about the
planet and its moons was gathered by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft,
which visited nearly 40 years ago, apparently on a bad day. New
research shows that Voyager 2 flew past during a solar storm, which
temporarily distorted the magnetic field and gave us an incorrect view
of what Uranus and its moons are normally like. NASA has plans to
launch a new mission to go back for a closer look. It is expected to
arrive by 2045 and inform scientists about whether the moons have the
possibility of being home to life.

 WILL WE CARE ABOUT FRAMEWORKS IN THE FUTURE? (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Frameworks are abstractions over a platform designed for people and
teams to accelerate work and maintenance while improving the
consistency and quality of projects. They frequently force a certain
type of structure and architecture. Software development is radically
shifting to a world where a person never actually has to manipulate
code directly anymore. AI doesn't care about shared logic,
extensibility, or inheritability of components - it just implements
what it needs. Frameworks may become obsolete in the future unless new
patterns of software architecture that work with AI are created. 

 🤔🔍 B2C BILLING IS ACTUALLY HARDER THAN B2B BILLING (14 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 B2C billing is often underestimated because it feels like a solved
problem. Choosing a billing system is a business-critical decision
that can have wide-reaching impacts on flexibility, compliance, and
customer retention. It may be tempting to build a custom solution, but
most companies are better off choosing an existing solution as they
cover most common billing challenges.

 FBI SEIZES POLYMARKET FOUNDER'S PHONE IN RAID OF HOME (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The FBI has seized the phone of Polymarket's founder and CEO Shayne
Coplan. Federal agents raided Coplan's Manhattan home early Wednesday
morning. It is unclear what prompted the FBI's search. A Polymarket
spokesperson claims that the raid is an act of obvious political
retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for
providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential
election.
