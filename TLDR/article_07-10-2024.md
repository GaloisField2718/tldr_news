greater emphasis on local community information, videos, and Facebook
Groups. The changes are aimed at making Facebook more approachable for

 GOOGLE'S GRIP ON SEARCH SLIPS AS TIKTOK AND AI STARTUP MOUNT
CHALLENGE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 TikTok has recently started allowing brands to target ads based on
users' search queries and Perplexity, an AI search startup, plans to
introduce ads later this month under its AI-generated answers.
Google's share of the US search ad market is expected to drop below
50% next year for the first time in over a decade. Generative AI,
which serves fully formed answers to user queries, is transforming
search products. Companies are experimenting with ways to monetize ads
with chatbots, but some analysts are uncertain whether ads in chatbots
will be as valuable as traditional search because people might be less
likely to click on them.

 THE US HAS PASSED PEAK OBESITY, A NEW SURVEY SUGGESTS. IS IT THE
OZEMPIC EFFECT? (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The obesity rate in adults in the US fell by 2% between 2020 and
2023. There is no established direct link between new weight-loss
drugs like Ozempic and the decline in obesity, but there is a strong
possibility of a link considering the medications hit the market
around 2021. Approximately one in eight US adults have tried the new
weight-loss drugs, with more than 15 million using a prescription. At
least 25,000 people in the US are starting the drug every week. 

 TO BE BORN IN A BAG (27 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Several research groups are developing artificial wombs to replicate
their basic life-support functions for extremely premature infants. At
least one group is working on a system to grow a fetus from embryo to
birth entirely outside of the womb. Such technology could have
profound implications for the future of human reproduction. Despite
several technology hurdles, it might not be very long before the first
human baby is birthed from a bag.

 CONTENT-VISIBILITY: THE NEW CSS PROPERTY THAT BOOSTS YOUR RENDERING
PERFORMANCE (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The content-visibility property launching in Chromium 85 may be one
of the most impactful new CSS properties for improving page load
performance. It enables the user agent to skip an element's rendering
work until it is needed. It also allows for faster interactions with
on-screen content. Reducing rendering work can in some situations
reduce a page's Interaction to Next Paint, a metric that evaluates a
page's ability to be reliably responsive to user input.

 WE'RE ENTERING UNCHARTED TERRITORY FOR MATH (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Terence Tao, a mathematics professor at UCLA widely considered to be
the world's greatest living mathematician, recently posted his
impressions of OpenAI's o1 model, comparing it to a mediocre but not
completely incompetent graduate student. This article contains an
edited transcript of an interview with Tao where he describes a kind
of AI-enabled 'industrial-scale mathematics' in which AI acts as a
lubricant for mathematicians' hypotheses and approaches to unlock new
information. This approach keeps humans at its core, embracing both
the strengths of people and machines. 

 THIS TEENAGE HACKER BECAME A LEGEND ATTACKING COMPANIES. THEN HIS
RIVALS ATTACKED HIM (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Arion Kurtaj is a hacker accused of breaking into Uber and stealing

hospital order for his crimes, confined to a secure mental health ward
until doctors and UK officials decide he is no longer a danger to the
public. His lawyers are seeking an appeal, arguing that evidence fails
to prove Kurtaj committed many of the offenses he is accused of or was
the central player. This article tells the story of Kurtaj's life.
Kurtaj lived a very empty offline life with all sorts of difficulties,
challenges, and limitations, but online, he was a bit of a superhero.
