EARLY LOOK AT IT (3 MINUTE READ) [5]

open-ended/exploratory questions and get generated AI Overview-style
responses. The company has started testing the experience with
employees. AI Mode is powered by a custom version of Gemini 2.0 that

 APPLE JUST BUILT AN ADORABLE ROBOT LAMP, A SNEAK PEEK INTO ROBOTICS
WORK (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple recently published a research paper and video that explains how
the company built a non-anthropomorphic robot lamp prototype with an
expressive design model rather than a functional one. The lamp
resembles Pixar's iconic Luxo and displays human-like gestures. It can
perform a variety of tasks with human-like expressions. A link to the
full video from Apple is available.

 WORLD'S FIRST LAB-GROWN MEAT FOR PETS GOES ON SALE (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Meatly's Chick Bites, a dog treat made from lab-grown meat, are
getting a limited release at a single pet store in the UK today. The
company plans to expand production in hopes of making its lab-grown
meat more widely available. The UK gave Meatly the green light to
produce pet food made from lab-grown meat in July last year. Chick
Bites are made from a combination of plant-based ingredients and
Meatly's lab-grown chicken, which the company claims is just as tasty
and nutritious as traditional chicken breast. 

 HOW DOES LIFE HAPPEN WHEN THERE'S BARELY ANY LIGHT? (14 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Life still exists in some of the coldest, darkest places on Earth,
where there is barely any light. Some phytoplankton living in the
Arctic are able to survive without becoming dormant even during
periods of 24-hour darkness. These organisms have their photosynthetic
machines up and running as soon as the barest amount of sunlight
returns. It is still unclear how the microalgae stay alive out of
dormancy. The ability may be shared by algae in other areas of the
deep sea, which means that the zone of productive ocean may be deeper
than previously thought.

 NONTRADITIONAL RED TEAMS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Every development team should have some exposure to red team
practices. Developers should check user-generated content for
offensive messaging and make sure their sites work correctly with ad
blockers. They should also make sure their forms work with password
managers. None of these factors are major blockers, but they're easy
to prevent. It's important to use your eyes before shipping. 

 WHERE DID TIKTOK'S SOFTWARE ENGINEERS GO? (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The uncertainty over TikTok's future has motivated the company's
engineers to interview and quit when they get an offer. Publicly
traded companies appear to be the most popular destination for
employees who leave. People appear to be quitting for better liquid
total compensation packages. A chart showing the flow of employees
from TikTok to other companies is available in the article.

 THE FUTURE BELONGS TO IDEA GUYS WHO CAN JUST DO THINGS (8 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 AI will make execution cheap. This will make brand, distribution, and
ideas much more important. There is currently an unbounded opportunity
for any proficient software engineer. People are still stuck at the
level of thinking about singular AI coworkers - it will be possible to
have thousands of agents working on the same problems at the same
time. 

 OPENAI LEAKS SALES AGENT IN TOKYO (3 MINUTE VIDEO) [12] 

 OpenAI recently demoed an AI sales agent in Tokyo. The demo showed
the agent using a Deep Research-like search to fill in customer
information, check available time slots, and email leads to schedule
meetings. It is unclear whether the demo was a mock-up of a product
its API users could build or an actual release for Enterprise
customers.
