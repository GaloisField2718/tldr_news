 TESLA HAS BEEN TESTING A ROBOTAXI SERVICE IN THE BAY AREA FOR MOST OF
THE YEAR (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk revealed during Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday that the
company has been testing a robotaxi service in the Bay Area. Tesla
employees have been able to summon an autonomously operated Tesla
vehicle for trips using the company's prototype ride-hailing app for
the past few months. The vehicles are operating using the latest
version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving software, which Musk claims will
be 1,000 times better than human driving by the second quarter of
2025. Musk says that he expects to roll out a paid ridehailing service
in California and Texas starting next year, pending regulatory
approval. 

 APPLE'S FIRST IOS 18.2 BETA ADDS MORE AI FEATURES AND CHATGPT

developer beta, now available, has new Apple Intelligence tools, but
doesn't include Genmoji.

 YOU SHOULD PROBABLY PAY ATTENTION TO TOKENIZERS (14 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Tokenization is the process of breaking down a piece of text into
smaller pieces called tokens. These tokens are then assigned an
integer value for identification within the tokenizer vocabulary, a
set of all possible tokens used in the tokenizer training. There are
different types of tokenizers. It's a good idea to be aware of which
one is used by the large language model you are trying to use. This
article discusses the different types of tokenizers and how they can
influence processing. 

 USING RUST IN NON-RUST SERVERS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE (22 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 This article discusses different strategies for incrementally adding
Rust into a searcher written in another language. Developers may want
to do this if they identify functions not meeting their performance
requirements because they're being bottlenecked by the CPU and the
usual techniques of memoizing the function or improving its algorithm
aren't feasible or effective. Sometimes, it's worth investigating
swapping out the function implementation for something written in a
more CPU-efficient language - like Rust.

 ARM CANCELS QUALCOMM'S ARCHITECTURE LICENSE, ENDANGERING ITS CHIP
BUSINESS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Arm has canceled Qualcomm's license for making Arm chips as part of
an escalation of a fight that began in late 2022 when Arm sued
Qualcomm over its acquisition of Nuvia in 2021. Qualcomm has 60 days
before it will be forced to stop manufacturing and selling its Arm
chips. It bought Nuvia to assist with developing high-performance Arm
chips, but Arm claimed the acquisition caused Nuvia to breach its Arm
licenses. Arm demanded that Qualcomm and Nuvia destroy any designs
that Nuvia had created pre-acquisition, but the companies didn't
comply. Qualcomm's shift to using Nuvia's designs means that Arm could
make less money from the partnership than it used to. 

 FORMER OPENAI STAFFER SAYS THE COMPANY IS BREAKING COPYRIGHT LAW AND
DESTROYING THE INTERNET (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Suchir Balaji, a former researcher at OpenAI, recently wrote in his
personal blog that he believes the company is not complying with US
copyright law, adding to the growing number of voices that say the
company's giant data scraping business is based on shaky legal ground.
Balaji worked at OpenAI for four years before leaving this summer. He
says that AI companies are destroying the commercial viability of the
individuals, businesses, and internet services that created the
digital data used to train AI systems. OpenAI claims it builds its AI
models using publicly available data in a legal and fair way. The
company is currently dealing with multiple lawsuits for its use of
copyright material.
