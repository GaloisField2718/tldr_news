 MANUS, A NEW AI AGENT FROM CHINA IS GOING VIRAL—AND RAISING BIG
QUESTIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Manus is an autonomous agent that can analyze, plan, and execute
tasks on its own. It is currently only accessible through invitation
codes, which are in short supply - demand is through the roof as the
AI community is raving about its capabilities. Many are now asking
whether China has leapfrogged the US in AI. Manus likely achieved its
impressive capabilities through innovative fine-tuning rather than
core model innovation. A video introducing Manus is available in the
article. 

 APPLE DELAYS SIRI UPGRADE INDEFINITELY AS AI CONCERNS ESCALATE (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is delaying updates to Siri for the foreseeable future. The
company's engineers believe that the features introduced last June
won't be released until next year at the earliest. Several executives
have voiced strong concerns as the features didn't work as advertised
in their personal testing. Apple may have to rebuild the features from
scratch.

 NATURAL ALTERNATIVE TO OZEMPIC BRINGS RESULTS WITHOUT SIDE EFFECTS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Stanford scientists have identified a naturally occurring molecule
that works like semaglutide, producing weight loss and improved
glucose and insulin tolerance, when tested in mice and minipigs. The
peptide, named BRP, only works in the brain, as opposed to
semaglutide, which has widespread effects. It specifically acts in the
hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism, which could be
an improvement over semaglutide. The scientists intend to move to
human clinical trials for BRP. 

 STARSHIP FLIGHT 8: SPACEX NAILS SUPER HEAVY BOOSTER CATCH BUT LOSES
UPPER STAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SpaceX's eight Starship test flight last Thursday aimed for the third
successful booster recovery and the deployment of a satellite
simulator. While the Super Heavy booster returned successfully to
Starbase's launch tower, the mission's upper stage disintegrated
during its flight. SpaceX has been reviewing the data from the flight
to better understand the incident's root cause. Video of the explosion
is available in the article.

 BUILDING AN AGENTIC SYSTEM (WEBSITE) [9] 

 This site provides a practical deep dive and code review into how to
build a self-driving coding agent, execution engine, tools, and
commands. It focuses on the systems and design decisions that go into
making agents that are real-time, self-corrective, and useful for
productive work. The site provides documentation on every tool and
command it covers, as well as implementation details. It covers the
underlying patterns that make real-time AI coding assistants feel
responsive, safe, and genuinely useful.

 MICROSOFT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH OPENAI IS NOT LOOKING GOOD (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 More evidence has surfaced that Microsoft is looking to split with
OpenAI. Microsoft is developing its own in-house reasoning models and
has been testing models from xAI, Meta, and DeepSeek to replace
ChatGPT in Copilot. Copilot has so far been received poorly in
enterprise due to its high cost and limited results. OpenAI and
Microsoft are quickly becoming competitors, so it makes sense that the
companies would want to detach from each other. Microsoft has an
interest in controlling the technologies and writing its own destiny. 

 META TAKES ANOTHER HIT AFTER REPORTS THAT IT BLACKLISTS EX-EMPLOYEES
(6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Meta reportedly maintains a de facto blacklist of ex-employees - even
some former workers with sterling track records have been blocked. The
company uses multiple systems to track rehire ineligibility, but the
exact mechanisms and number of affected employees are unclear. While
the blacklist may not sit well with outsiders, it is not illegal. The
routine banishment of ex-workers isn't exclusive to Meta, with Amazon,
Google, Microsoft, and many other companies purportedly maintaining
similar lists.
