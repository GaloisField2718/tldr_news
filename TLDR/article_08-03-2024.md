 KEY OPENAI EXECUTIVE PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE IN SAM ALTMAN‚ÄôS OUSTER
(9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI's chief technology officer Mira Murati questioned Sam Altman's
management in front of the board last year before Altman was briefly
ousted from the company. This move helped to propel the board's
decision to force Altman out. Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and chief
scientist of OpenAI, expressed similar concerns. Both executives said
that Altman sometimes created a toxic work environment by freezing out
executives who did not support his decisions. WilmerHale, the law firm
investigating the incident, is expected to release a report in the
coming days that could shed more light on the board's decision.

[5] 

 Apple is planning to release a 20.3-inch MacBook with a foldable
screen in 2027, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. It will have
a screen measuring about 20 inches diagonally when fully expanded. The
laptop is Apple's only foldable product with a clear development
schedule. A foldable iPhone or iPad is not likely to come any time
soon.

 NEW WEIGHT LOSS PILL MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OZEMPIC, TESTS FIND (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Novo Nordisk's new obesity treatment drug, amycretin, helped patients
lose 13% of their body weight in just 12 weeks. The drug may be more
effective than semaglutide. Amycretin targets GLP-1 and another
hormone called amylin, both of which are believed to be linked to
hunger and satiety. The drug still needs to go through much larger
trials that will likely drag on for years before it will be publicly
available. The results of the initial trials sent Novo Nordisk's stock
rising as much as 8.3%. 

 ENGINEER PLANS SOLAR PANEL IMPLANT FOR HUMAN RETINA TO RETAIN
EYESIGHT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Engineers from the University of New South Wales in Australia are
working on a prototype solar panel implant for the retinas to restore
sight. The implant converts light into electrical signals that can be
directed to the optic nerve, enabling vision. Users may need to wear
special glasses or goggles that amplify sunlight for the device to
work. The device is still in a proof-of-concept stage - a lot more
work still needs to be done before it is ready for human implantation.

 WHY FACEBOOK DOESN‚ÄôT USE GIT (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mercurial is a tool for creating and managing code changes used at
Facebook. Facebook started out on Git, but it began hitting scaling
limits in around 2012. Mercurial's developers were receptive to the
idea of Facebook engineers contributing patches to scale it better
while Git's developers were not. There were other alternatives, but
all were quickly disqualified. Facebook adopted Mercurial not because
it had better technology, but because the maintainers and codebase
felt more open. 

 GRATS (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Grats makes building GraphQL servers as simple as writing functions.
It leverages existing type annotations to automatically extract an
executable GraphQL scheme from generic TypeScript resolver code. Grats
makes the TypeScript implementation into a source of truth so
developers don't have to worry about validating whether their
implementations match their schemas.

 OPENAI: FACTS FROM A WEEKEND - AN UPDATE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The investigation into OpenAI's sudden ousting of Sam Altman is
almost over, and it appears Altman won. A new board has apparently
been chosen. Leaks about the case are likely moves from the
anti-Altman faction to strike first before WilmerHale's report is
released. This post makes predictions about the results of the
investigation and who will be on the new OpenAI board. 

 US LAWMAKERS VOTE 50-0 TO FORCE SALE OF TIKTOK DESPITE ANGRY CALLS
FROM USERS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The House Commerce Committee has voted to approve a bill that would
force ByteDance to sell the company or lose access to the US market.
The bill still has to pass in the House and Senate and be signed into
law before it comes into effect. TikTok is urging its users to protest
the bill. Lawmakers responded by noting that the app will only be
banned if it doesn't sever its relationship with the Chinese Communist
Party.
