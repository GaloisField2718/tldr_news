 THE ARCHITECTURE OF GRAB'S DATA LAKE (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Grab uses a data lake to store and analyze data from its various
services. The company carefully selects data storage formats based on
data throughput, using different strategies for high and low
throughput scenarios. For high-throughput data, it uses Apache Avro
with Merge on Read for faster write speeds. For low-throughput data,
it uses Parquet with Copy on Write for faster read speeds. 

 FACETCONTROLLER: HOW WE MADE INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES AT LYFT SIMPLE (7
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Lyft uses Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) called
"facets" to manage and deploy microservices, which are composed of
smaller Kubernetes components. To simplify infrastructure changes, it
developed FacetController, which manages the lifecycle of these facets
by creating or updating individual facet resources instead of all
associated Kubernetes objects. FacetController automates
infrastructure updates, making sure changes like Kubernetes upgrades
and autoscaling adjustments are rolled out safely and efficiently
across all services. 

 EXTREME SERVER SIDE RENDERING (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Extreme Server Side Rendering (XSSR) is a technique where the server
continuously streams HTML updates to the client, creating dynamic web
pages without JavaScript. This post demonstrates how to use XSSR with
a Flappy Bird clone, where the game logic runs entirely on the server,
updating the client-side display with constantly streamed CSS. While
XSSR has acceptable performance and bandwidth usage, it suffers from
latency issues due to server round trips for every user interaction.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 IT'S STILL WORTH BLOGGING IN THE AGE OF AI (8 MINUTE READ) [7]

portfolio. 

 APPLYING THE WEB DEV MINDSET TO DEALING WITH LIFE CHALLENGES (16
MINUTE READ) [8]

manipulating language, can be applied to personal growth and
self-defense. He compares toxic people to blackhat hackers and verbal
abuse to cross-site scripting attacks. 

 THE TRUTH ABOUT WORKING IN BIG TECH (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google and Meta have great perks like high pay, great work-life
balance, access to various resources, and talented colleagues. Despite
these benefits, the author Andrew left to pursue entrepreneurship,
driven by a desire to build something of his own and avoid the
stagnation and "corporate theatre" he felt in big tech.

body handling, and providing lifecycle hooks for request control. It
also has error handling, authentication, and customization options for
response parsing, error handling, and parameter/body serialization.

 HOW THE BIGGEST HACK IN HISTORY HAPPENED (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 $1.4 billion was stolen from Bybit in a hack orchestrated by North
Korea's Lazarus Group. Attackers manipulated the "operation" parameter
in a Safe smart contract transaction to enable something called
delegatecall, granting them control over Bybit's wallet through
malicious contracts. The compromised transaction bypassed standard
security checks by replacing the legitimate one in the signing
interface, which then allowed unauthorized fund transfers. 

 AI CRACKS SUPERBUG PROBLEM IN TWO DAYS THAT TOOK SCIENTISTS YEARS (4
MINUTE READ) [15]

London used the AI tool to replicate their findings. It also offered
four additional hypotheses, one of which the team hadn't considered
and is now investigating.
