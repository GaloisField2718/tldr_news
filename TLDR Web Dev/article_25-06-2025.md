ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING THE TWITTER 1.0 WEB EXPERIENCE (35 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Twitter Lite was a Progressive Web App designed to provide a fast,
responsive, and data-efficient Twitter experience across all devices,
especially in emerging markets with low-end devices and unreliable
internet. Starting in 2015, Twitter Lite aimed to create a universal
web app from a single codebase, leading to a 65% increase in pages per
session and a 75% increase in tweets sent. This article goes over the
technical aspects, like code splitting, service workers for caching,
image optimization, lazy loading, and responsive design principles. 

 FAST(ER) REGULAR EXPRESSION ENGINES IN RUBY (18 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article compares the performance of different regular expression
engines in Ruby, including the default Onigmo, re2 (Google),
rust/regex, and pcre2. Benchmarks show that rust/regex is the fastest
overall, while re2 is generally faster than Ruby's default, except
when dealing with Unicode text. 

 WORKER THREADS IN NODE.JS: A COMPLETE GUIDE FOR MULTITHREADING IN
JAVASCRIPT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Worker Threads allow you to spawn multiple threads of execution
within a single process, with each worker running in its own isolated
V8 environment to execute heavy JavaScript code without blocking the
main event loop. They are ideal for CPU-intensive tasks like image
processing, data parsing, complex mathematical computations, and
machine learning inference.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WRITING TOY SOFTWARE IS A JOY (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Writing "toy programs" is a way to rekindle joy in software
development, especially as AI and commodification threaten the craft.
These programs focus on 20% effort for 80% functionality. 

 PROGRAMMER YELLING AT THE CLOUDS ABOUT VIBE CODING (4 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 While AI can be helpful for simple tasks like auto-completion, it
struggles with complex problems and often provides solutions no better
than existing resources like StackOverflow. Reviewing AI-generated
code requires a deep understanding, potentially more than reviewing
code from human colleagues. 

 WHY ENGINEERS HATE THEIR MANAGERS (AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT) (7 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Engineers often have frustration towards their managers due to common
management anti-patterns. These include disrupting focus with frequent
meetings, making uninformed technical decisions, taking credit for
engineers' work, and scheduling excessive unnecessary meetings.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WORKSHOP: DEBUGGING AI IN PRODUCTION WITH SENTRY (SPONSOR) [11] 

 With AI, finding what went wrong takes more than a stack trace. It
means chasing weird responses, deciphering model behavior, and
untangling workflows that were definitely working before the newest
model came out. Join Sentry engineers for a hands-on workshop [11] on
debugging AI applications and agents with full-stack visibility. Join
live to code along [11] 

 VSCAN (WEBSITE) [12] 

 VSCan is a tool that analyzes Visual Studio Code extensions for
security vulnerabilities. You can input an extension's name or ID, and
VSCan performs a deep analysis of its code, permissions, and metadata.
The tool then generates a report detailing potential risks and
recommendations. 

 AUTUMN (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Autumn is an open-source platform that makes pricing and billing
easier by acting as an intermediary between Stripe and your
application. It supports various pricing models like subscriptions,
credit systems, and usage-based models, without requiring extensive
webhook management. 

 INTL-T (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Intl-T is a fully-typed, object-based i18n translation library for
TypeScript with features like autocomplete, node-based translations,
and support for JSON files and dynamic remote imports. It integrates
easily with React and Next.js and provides components for React
injection and server-side rendering.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE BITTER LESSON IS COMING FOR TOKENIZATION (29 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Tokenization-free LLMs are possible. Tokenization is efficient but
can lead to information loss and various issues that have to be
addressed later on with different methods. The post explains recent
advancements in byte-level models like ByT5, MambaByte, MEGABYTE,
SpaceByte, and ends with a detailed analysis of the BLT architecture,
which uses an entropy-based dynamic patcher to compress sequences and
allocate compute more efficiently. 

 BASIC FACTS ABOUT GPUS (33 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article goes over the intricacies of GPU performance, focusing
on maximizing efficiency through understanding the compute and memory
hierarchy. It explains how to analyze kernel performance, categorized
as memory-bound, compute-bound, or overhead-bound, and introduces the
Roofline model for visualization. 

 MCP IS EATING THE WORLD—AND IT'S HERE TO STAY (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 MCP is gaining traction despite previous attempts at connecting LLMs
to external tools falling short. This is because MCP benefits from
better LLMs, a vendor-neutral protocol design, and straightforward
tooling, making it easier for developers to adopt it for building and
sharing tools.

 (MAP LLMS EXCEL) SAVED MY PASSION FOR GAME DEV (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Frustrated by tedious data entry in his game development project,
this developer rediscovered his passion by using LLMs to map his Excel
data into C# code, saving him time and preventing burnout. 

 GEMINI ROBOTICS ON-DEVICE BRINGS AI TO LOCAL ROBOTIC DEVICES (5
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Gemini Robotics On-Device is a new, efficient, and adaptable
on-device robotics model optimized for general-purpose dexterity, fast
task adaptation, and operation in environments with limited
connectivity. 

 INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE IS A MUST HAVE (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) means defining infrastructure
configurations as code (e.g., using Terraform) - it is necessary for
modern cloud environments because it allows for reusability, easy
rollbacks, transparency, and faster deployment. 

 CONNECT ANY REACT APPLICATION TO AN MCP SERVER IN THREE LINES OF CODE
(11 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Cloudflare's use-mcp is a React library that makes the connection of
React applications to MCP servers easier with just three lines of
code.
