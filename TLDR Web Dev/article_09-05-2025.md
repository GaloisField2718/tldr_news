 HOW NODE.JS WORKS BEHIND THE SCENES (30 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that uses a complex event loop with
six distinct phases (timers, pending callbacks, idle/prepare, poll,
check, and close callbacks) to perform non-blocking I/O operations on
a single thread. It uses the libuv C/C++ library to directly access
operating system resources for handling asynchronous operations like
file reading, network requests, and timers. 

 HARDENING GITHUB ACTIONS: LESSONS FROM RECENT ATTACKS (11 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Hardening GitHub Actions workflows means making them more secure. The
basics of making these workflows more secure include following best
practices for writing safe workflows and managing secrets properly.
Focus on minimizing third-party actions, limiting permissions, and
auditing for poisoned pipeline execution.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MICROSERVICES ARE A TAX YOUR STARTUP PROBABLY CAN'T AFFORD (18 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Premature adoption of microservices can reduce startup velocity due
to increased complexity in deployment, development, and testing.
Monoliths, while potentially messy, allow teams to focus on delivering
customer value and have simpler deployment supported by strong
community frameworks. Microservices should be reserved for addressing
real scaling bottlenecks and only implemented when the organizational
structure and operational overhead can support them. 

 NEXTJS IS A PAIN IN THE ASS (REDDIT THREAD) [7] 

 Next.js sometimes feels unnecessarily complex for a small project,
particularly when managing state high in the component tree. The
benefits of server-side rendering in Next.js may not outweigh the
associated development headaches and potential for large refactors. 

 NOBODY CODES HERE ANYMORE (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI coding agents like Cursor and Claude Code were rolled out to a
team of 40 Ruby on Rails developers. Developers who used the tools
were around 20% more productive, especially when increasing code
ambition and refactoring. The biggest limitation was remembering to
use the agents. While they were great at straightforward tasks, they
produced ugly code and required oversight to avoid subtle errors. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 VOID (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Void is an open-source alternative to Cursor. It allows for the use
of AI agents, checkpointing, and local model hosting. Void is forked
from the VS Code repository. 

 REACT SOUNDS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 A lightweight library with hundreds of ready-to-use sound effects
that you can add to your web app. It can be added with a hook. The
sounds are lazy-loaded for performance. 

 BROKK (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Brokk is an AI-native code platform for large codebases that provides
compiler-grade context to LLMs.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FINDING A BUG IN CHROMIUM (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A developer discovered a memory leak bug in Chromium related to WASM
memory management in their Electron app, Atrium. The issue was from
the JavaScript engine failing to consistently call finalizers in the
FinalizationRegistry, which led to unreleased WASM memory. This
behavior persisted across reloads, requiring a new window to resolve
the leak. 

 THE FUTURE OF AI INTERACTION: BEYOND JUST TEXT (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Model Context Protocol has the potential to enable AI to deliver
dynamic, on-demand user interfaces instead of just text responses.
Examples like interactive maps and stopwatches show the importance of
UI in making the user experience top-notch. This means that UI
developers will be essential in building these AI-powered, multimodal
experiences. 

 ARE 'CSS CAROUSELS' ACCESSIBLE? (20 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 CSS Carousels, a new experimental feature that allows JavaScript-free
carousel creation with CSS, fails accessibility requirements because
browsers incorrectly expose scroll markers as ARIA tab roles
regardless of the pattern being implemented. This results in missing
relationships, identical accessibility names, broken keyboard
navigation, and inconsistent states that confuse screen reader users.

QUICK LINKS

 FROM: STEVE JOBS. "GREAT IDEA, THANK YOU." (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A new NeXT employee inadvertently grabbed the email alias
steve@next.com, panicked from the misdirected emails meant for Steve
Jobs, reassigned it to Steve Jobs, and received a surprisingly
positive "Great idea, thank you" email in return. 

 PODFOX (WEBSITE) [16] 

 Podfox allows for container-aware browsing that eliminates port
conflicts by allowing direct communication with Podman containers. 

 A FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE STARLINK USER TERMINAL (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This security rundown of the Starlink user terminal goes over its
hardware architecture, firmware, security measures (including a
dedicated security chip), potential telemetry data collection, and the
presence of numerous SSH keys. 

 TY (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 Ty is an extremely fast Python type checker and language server
written in Rust.
