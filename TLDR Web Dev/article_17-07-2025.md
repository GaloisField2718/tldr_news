ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CRAWLING A BILLION WEB PAGES IN JUST OVER 24 HOURS, IN 2025 (17
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This dev successfully crawled a billion web pages in just over 24
hours on a budget of a few hundred dollars. The crawler was designed
with politeness and fault-tolerance in mind, focusing on HTML content
only and adhering to robots.txt rules. The system used a cluster of
optimized nodes, each with its own Redis instance, fetcher processes,
and parser processes, overcoming bottlenecks like parsing speed by
using modern libraries and truncating page content. 

 DEBUGGING THE ONE-IN-A-MILLION FAILURE: MIGRATING PINTEREST'S SEARCH
INFRASTRUCTURE TO KUBERNETES (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pinterest's engineering team encountered a performance issue while
migrating their internal search system, Manas, to Kubernetes, where a
small percentage of search requests experienced massive latency
spikes. Through a process of elimination and profiling, they
discovered that the monitoring tool cAdvisor was the culprit,
specifically its default collection of the container_referenced_bytes
metric. This metric invasively scanned and cleared page table entries,
causing memory contention with Manas' memory-intensive search indices.
Disabling the problematic metric in cAdvisor resolved the latency
spikes. 

 ARTISANAL HANDCRAFTED GIT REPOSITORIES (24 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 You can manually create Git repositories by bypassing standard Git
commands and directly manipulating the underlying Git objects. This
post explains Git's internal workings, focusing on content addressable
storage, commit objects, and tree objects, and walks through how to
manually create file blobs, tree blobs, and commits.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I WAS WRONG ABOUT ROBOTS.TXT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This dev initially blocked all web crawlers using robots.txt to
protect his data, but this inadvertently broke link previews on his
LinkedIn posts. LinkedIn's bot couldn't access the necessary Open
Graph meta tags to generate previews because it was blocked by the
robots.txt file. To fix this, he updated his robots.txt to
specifically allow the LinkedInBot to crawl his website. 

 I'M SWITCHING TO PYTHON AND ACTUALLY LIKING IT (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This dev shifted to Python for AI development. His Python toolbox
includes uv for package management, ruff for linting and formatting,
and FastAPI for building APIs. For version control and infrastructure
management, he uses GitHub Actions, Dependabot, Gitleaks, pre-commit
hooks, Make, and Docker.

(SPONSOR) [9] 

 QA Wolf's [10] AI-native service gets web and mobile apps to 80%
automated end-to-end test coverage in just 4 months. They build and
maintain your automated test suite, plus provide unlimited parallel
test runs.

 CLAUDE CODE ROUTER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Claude Code Router is a tool that allows devs to route Claude Code
requests to different language models and customize requests while
still using the official Claude Code infrastructure. It's configured
via a `config.json` file, enabling routing based on factors like
background tasks, reasoning needs, or context length to services like
OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, Gemini, and Volcengine. 

 SHIPPING WEBGPU ON WINDOWS IN FIREFOX 141 (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Firefox 141 will ship WebGPU on Windows, enabling high-performance
web applications for games, visualization, and computation. This
implementation, based on the Rust crate WGPU, follows the WebGPU and
WGSL standards developed with Mozilla's participation. 

 EULER HS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 EulerHS is a Haskell framework that makes the creation of concurrent
backend and console applications easier. It has pre-integrated
subsystems like SQL databases, logging, and KV databases.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE PRAGMATIC ENGINEER 2025 SURVEY: WHAT'S IN YOUR TECH STACK? (29
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Pragmatic Engineer conducted a survey with nearly 3,000 tech
workers to analyze the current tech landscape. The survey covered
demographics, AI tools, programming languages, IDEs/terminals, version
control, CI/CD, and cloud providers. It found that AI tools are
rapidly gaining popularity, with GitHub Copilot leading and Cursor
showing fast growth. TypeScript and Python are the most-used
languages, while JIRA is the most-disliked tool. 

 LLM DAYDREAMING (13 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A "day-dreaming loop" (DDL) for LLMs might address their lack of
novelty and insight. The DDL involves a background process that
continuously samples concepts, explores connections, and filters for
valuable ideas. This process, while computationally expensive, could
kickstart more innovation and generate proprietary training data. 

 HOW AND WHERE WILL AGENTS SHIP SOFTWARE? (10 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 InstantDB provides agents with full-stack backends, including
databases, sync engines, and auth tools, to make the creation of
applications easier. Agents and humans benefit from built-in
abstractions, cost-efficient hosting, and exposed data.

QUICK LINKS

 GASLIGHT-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 "Gaslight-driven development" is a new trend where AI language models
subtly influence API design by consistently suggesting certain
features or methods, leading developers to implement them even if they
weren't initially planned. 

 AM I BECOMING IRRELEVANT? (5 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 After transitioning from a hands-on role to a leadership position,
this person feels more and more irrelevant, grappling with the lack of
visible impact and recognition despite enabling their team's success. 

 SCALABILITY IS NOT PERFORMANCE (8 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Scalability is the ability to adjust system throughput based on
demand, and it is distinct from performance, which refers to the
throughput itself. 

 HOW AI VIBE CODING IS DESTROYING JUNIOR DEVELOPERS' CAREERS (15
MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Vibe coding makes developers slower, despite their perception of
increased productivity, so devs should use AI as a tool to improve
their existing skills and focus on mastering the fundamentals of
programming.
