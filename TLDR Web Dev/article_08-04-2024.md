ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE LIFECYCLE OF A CODE AI COMPLETION (30 MINUTE READ) [3] 

 Code completion tools provide background LLMs with the right context,
such as related files and code snippets from the project. This
process, known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG), helps guide
LLMs to produce more accurate code completions. Sourcegraph's team has
detailed the engineering optimizations they implemented to improve
code suggestion quality and speed with Cody autocomplete. For example,
they found that including whitespace at the end of prompts causes
significantly worse responses. 

 GLOBAL PROGRESS IN NEXT.JS (14 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The solution presented in this article adds a loading progress bar to
Next.js sites using a custom ‚ÄòuseProgress‚Äô hook and a
‚ÄòProgressLink‚Äô component, making page transitions smooth without
needing router events. It keeps sites responsive and interactive
during loads by utilizing React‚Äôs ‚ÄòstartTransition‚Äô. The method
is future-proof and improves the user experience.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HIGH-FUNCTIONING WORKAHOLISM (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The typical definition of workaholism focuses on long hours, which
typically comes with negative consequences. True "high-functioning"
workaholism affects a person's well-being (like sleep and healthy
habits). It is about maximizing output within a set window of time
rather than simply working more hours. 

 EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY IN CODE REVIEWS (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 When giving feedback in code reviews, use gentle questions like "I
wonder" and "What do you think" to keep the conversation friendly.
Avoid "why" questions - use "what" instead to be less direct. Choose
softer words to help everyone feel comfortable and open to
suggestions. This way, you can share ideas without making anyone
defensive. 

 SHIPPING CODE FASTER (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To ship code faster, identify where you spend most of your time:
design, coding, testing, review, or deployment. If you‚Äôre new to a
codebase, focus on understanding code flow, tracing techniques, and
learning from experienced colleagues. To optimize testing and review,
use feature flags, batch changes, automate testing, and aim for
smaller, well-explained code changes for faster reviews.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AUTOMQ (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 AutoMQ is a cloud-native implementation for Apache Kafka. It‚Äôs
serverless, works with any cloud provider, and can cut your cloud
infrastructure bill by up to 90%. 

 CLANGQL (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 ClangQL is a tool that allows you to run SQL-like queries on C/C++
Code instead of database files using the GitQL SDK. 

 PGMOCK (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 pgmock is an in-memory PostgreSQL mock server for unit and E2E tests.
It requires no external dependencies and runs entirely within
WebAssembly on both Node.js and the browser.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW GOOGLE BUILT AN OPEN SOURCE AI TO PROVIDE ACCURATE FLOOD WARNINGS
FOR 460 MILLION PEOPLE (25 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google AI is helping to predict floods better, which could save lots
of people and money around the world every year. Utilizing machine
learning, particularly LSTM models, Google AI has significantly
improved the accuracy and extended the reliability of flood
predictions, especially in data-scarce regions like Africa and Asia.
It advocates for open-source collaboration, targeted AI investments,
and the development of a robust data infrastructure. 

 GOOGLE PUBLIC DNS‚ÄôS APPROACH TO FIGHT AGAINST CACHE POISONING
ATTACKS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DNS cache poisoning attacks exploit weaknesses in DNS to redirect
users to malicious sites. Google Public DNS protects against these
attacks using a few techniques. It randomizes cases, altering the
capitalization of domain names. This protects over 90% of Google
Public DNS traffic. Google also uses DNS-over-TLS (ADoT) to encrypt
communications with authoritative nameservers.

 ASK HN: WHAT IS THE MOST USELESS PROJECT YOU HAVE WORKED ON? (HACKER
NEWS THREAD) [13] 

 Many engineers have worked on internal systems and tools that have
cost years of time and millions of dollars, just for those systems to
never be used. 

 10 MUST-READS FOR ENGINEERING LEADERS (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A list of books covering team building, management styles, and career
growth. 

 FACES.JS (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Faces.js is a JavaScript library for generating and displaying
customizable cartoon faces using SVGs. 

 A PROPOSAL TO ADD SIGNALS TO JAVASCRIPT (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 The JavaScript Signals proposal is about creating a standard way for
JavaScript programs to automatically update when data changes, making
it easier for different tools and frameworks to work together.
