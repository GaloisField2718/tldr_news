ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY LOAD BALANCING AT SCALE IS HARD (11 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Load balancing at scale is quite complex. While simple approaches
like round-robin work initially, challenges come up from unequal
request types, dynamic server lists, and the need for server
warm-up/draining strategies. Proxies must also grapple with making
load balancing decisions based on limited, local views and
architectural considerations that can impact distribution. 

 HOW LLMS SEE THE WORLD (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 LLMs see and process text through tokenization, breaking text into
smaller units before converting them into numerical representations.
Common tokenization methods include BPE, WordPiece, and SentencePiece.
The method of tokenization can impact costs, context limits, and model
performance in areas like non-English languages and mathematical
reasoning.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY LLMS CAN'T REALLY BUILD SOFTWARE (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 LLMs can't truly build software. While LLMs are great at generating
and updating code, they struggle to maintain clear mental models of
code and requirements, leading to confusion and flawed
decision-making. This limitation is due to issues like context
omission, recency bias, and hallucination, preventing LLMs from
properly iterating towards working solutions for complex tasks. 

 IS CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT AI REASONING A MIRAGE? (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chain-of-thought reasoning in AI is a mirage because, often, the
reasoning demonstrated in papers is usually too simplistic to draw
conclusions from. Reasoning likely requires language use and a certain
level of model size. 

 NO, AI IS NOT MAKING ENGINEERS 10X AS PRODUCTIVE (19 MINUTE READ) [8]


 The notion that AI is making engineers 10x more productive is not
true. While AI can be helpful for specific tasks, it doesn't
drastically increase overall productivity due to bottlenecks in the
software development process and the importance of human factors like
code review and critical thinking.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 VAULTRICE (WEBSITE) [9] 

 Vaultrice is a globally distributed key-value store that offers
real-time state management without backend complexities using a
familiar API. It lets devs define state, sync it instantly via
WebSockets, and collaborate across multiple clients and devices.
Built-in features include a simple `localStorage`-like API, real-time
sync, and configurable security with optional End-to-End Encryption. 

 YAMS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 YAMS (Yet Another Memory System) is a tool for persistent memory
designed for use with LLMs and other applications. It uses
content-addressed storage with features like deduplication,
compression, full-text and semantic search, and crash recovery. 

 CRUSH (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Crush is an AI coding agent designed to work within your terminal,
integrating with various LLMs and tools. It has features like
multi-model support, session management, LSP enhancement, and
extensibility via MCPs.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NEW TREND: EXTREME HOURS AT AI STARTUPS (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI startups are increasingly adopting extreme work hours, similar to
the "996" schedule previously common in China. Companies like
Cognition, Replit, and xAI expect employees to work 80+ hours per week
as they believe that early AGI dominance will lead to industry-wide
control. While this intense work culture is incentivized by potential
financial rewards and the fear of being outpaced, it can also lead to
burnout and reduced productivity. 

 YOUR MAC GAME IS PROBABLY RENDERING BLURRY (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Many Mac games on notched displays render blurry due to using the
wrong resolution, drawing to the entire screen instead of the area
below the notch. The `CGDisplayCopyAllDisplayModes` function returns
resolutions for both the full display and the usable area under the
menu bar, but games often default to the former, causing a compressed
image. A solution is to filter the resolution list using
`safeAreaInsets` to find resolutions fitting within the usable area. 

 DO WE UNDERSTAND HOW NEURAL NETWORKS WORK? (15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 While we understand the mathematical code and training processes
behind modern neural networks like LLMs, we don't have a deep
understanding of how they achieve specific results or the complex
statistics they derive from data. We can reverse engineer some
specific functions, like identifying a "Golden Gate Bridge" neuron or
how arithmetic is performed, but these are limited and often
surprising. The end result of training is a vast, interconnected web
of statistics that is difficult to comprehend, and it is hard to
determine in advance what poem an LLM will write by looking at the
training code.

 I MADE A REAL-TIME C/C++/RUST BUILD VISUALIZER (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 What the Fork is a cross-platform tool that visualizes software
builds in real-time, allowing devs to identify and address
inefficiencies, such as a lack of parallelism or unnecessary
processes. 

 STEVE WOZNIAK: LIFE TO ME WAS NEVER ABOUT ACCOMPLISHMENT, BUT ABOUT
HAPPINESS (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Steve Wozniak gave away his Apple wealth to pursue happiness and fund
charitable causes, finding fulfillment in his work and philanthropy
despite not focusing on accumulating wealth.
