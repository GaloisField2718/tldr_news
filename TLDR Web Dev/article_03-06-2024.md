ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WANT TO UNLOCK PERFORMANCE AND CLARITY? USE STRONG TYPES! (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Strong types in programming languages like C++ and Rust, which
enforce specific data types and rules for variables, lead to fewer
bugs, more expressive APIs, and potentially better performance. They
prevent invalid input, improve code clarity, and reduce the need for
repetitive error checking (like in JavaScript with undefined). 

 THINGS YOU WISH YOU DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW ABOUT S3 (18 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Amazon S3 has some aspects that can lead to security vulnerabilities.
This article goes through some of these, such as the ability to
perform certain actions without authentication, alternative ways to
retrieve object keys, incomplete multipart uploads that can be deleted
but not downloaded, and the potential for accidental public exposure
of buckets through misconfigurations. 

 GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED POSTGRES FOR MULTI-TENANT APPLICATIONS (11
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article describes a pattern for geographically distributing
PostgreSQL databases for multi-tenant applications using only standard
PostgreSQL functionality. The pattern involves separating per-tenant
data from control plane data, placing tenant data in the nearest
region, creating a global view using Foreign Data Wrappers, and
partitioning, while keeping authentication and control plane data
centralized. This approach lowers latencies, complies with data
residency laws, and allows edge computing while maintaining most
PostgreSQL features and ACID guarantees within tenants.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SOME THOUGHTS AS I SIT HERE IN ANOTHER STANDUP (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Agile and Scrum are too rigid and bureaucratic as implemented in the
industry right now. Daily standup is a prime example of a pointless
and unproductive ceremony that wastes developers' time and fails to
actually foster progress. 

 SPEND 2 HOURS DISCUSSING, MAKE THE WRONG DECISION ANYWAY (10 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Meetings are timesuck for devs. To be useful and effective, meetings
should have an authoritative document to guide discussions. This makes
sure that everyone is on the same page about the project's goals and
complexities. 

 MY 3-STEP PROCESS FOR WRITING CLEAN CODE (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A three-step process for writing clean code: first, prioritize making

and clean up the code while relying on the tests.

database. To support this paradigm, PowerSync [11] allows you to build
local-first apps with simple state management and real-time reactivity
[11] by continuously syncing your SQL databases.
