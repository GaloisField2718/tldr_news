ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 RUNNING OCR AGAINST PDFS AND IMAGES DIRECTLY IN YOUR BROWSER (6
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This article is a breakdown of a web app that combines PDF.js for PDF
processing and Tesseract.js for OCR functionality, allowing users to
drag and drop PDFs or images directly in their browser for text
extraction. The project was built quickly with the help of Claude 3
Opus and ChatGPT for code generation. The end result is a program that
is simple, runs locally without data uploads, and will work well
without needing any updates in the future. 

 THE GREAT MIGRATION FROM MONGODB TO POSTGRESQL (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Infisical, a secrets management platform, migrated from MongoDB to
PostgreSQL because of difficulties configuring transactions in
MongoDB, a lack of relational features, inconsistent versioning across
cloud providers, and a lack of a good user experience with MongoDB.
The migration process required a temporary block on write operations
and involved careful data transformation to map MongoDB's structure to
PostgreSQL's relational model. LevelDB was used to persistently store
and map identifiers between the databases. The migration itself led to
significant performance gains and cost reductions. 

 REACT COMPILER & REACT 19 - FORGET ABOUT MEMOIZATION SOON? (7 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 React 19 and the React Compiler have been dominating the React
discussion over the past month over the possibility of never having to
think about memoization in React very soon. However, a huge change
like this is not as simple as a version or tool release. This post
summarizes and clarifies what is coming in React 19 and the React
Compiler and offers a technical explanation of the coming changes.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO GET DEEP, TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AS AN ENGINEER (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 It is important to understand fundamentals as a software engineer. A
good way to do so is to challenge yourself by building without
frameworks and proactively seek out areas where you can take ownership
in your projects. Anyone can achieve a high level of technical
proficiency by taking initiative, focusing on the fundamentals, and
embracing a growth mindset. 

 DON‚ÄôT USE YOUR ORM ENTITIES FOR EVERYTHING ‚Äî EMBRACE THE SQL! (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) are useful tools, but shouldn't be
treated as the only way to interact with your database. The belief
that ORMs completely eliminate the need to write SQL is misguided -
SQL should be used directly to optimize your database interactions.
Using techniques like projections that select only the necessary data
can improve performance a lot. 

 "INSECURE VIBES" ARE A SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Insecure vibes are subtle signals you may unintentionally emit when
feeling anxious or uncertain. They can weaken your communication and
interactions. These vibes manifest as overcompensating, defensiveness,
or a lack of confidence, which are the very things you may be trying
to hide. To combat insecure vibes, be mindful of your behavior and
actively project confidence, even if you don't feel it internally.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SPICE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Spice is a runtime that provides developers with a unified SQL query
interface to locally materialize, accelerate, and query datasets
sourced from any database, data warehouse, or data lake. 

 CREATE VUE3 APP (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This tool uses Vite to help you spin up a new Vue-based app using
tools based on answers you give to a number of questions. 

 PRAGMATIC DRAG AND DROP (WEBSITE) [12] 

 A performance-focused drag-and-drop library that can be used to power
experiences on any frontend stack.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT THE XZ BACKDOOR (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A sophisticated security attack compromised the xz compression
library, a critical dependency of OpenSSH. The backdoor, introduced by
a seemingly helpful new maintainer, allowed attackers to gain
unauthorized access to affected servers. The backdoor was discovered
by Andres Freund, a software engineer at Microsoft, when he found that
SSH logins were using a lot of CPU power compared to normal. 

 CAN DEMIS HASSABIS SAVE GOOGLE? (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Demis Hassabis, the founder of DeepMind, is now tasked with keeping
Google in the lead of the AI race. To succeed, Hassabis must translate
DeepMind's research into tangible product improvements and convince
Google to embrace potentially disruptive changes. If he is successful,
DeepMind's focus on reinforcement learning could position the company
well as chatbots evolve into autonomous agents that can take action in
the real world. 

 HOW GITHUB REPLACED SOURCEFORGE AS THE DOMINANT CODE HOSTING PLATFORM
(12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Before GitHub, sites like SourceForge and Google Code existed for
hosting open-source software, but they lacked the social features and
focus on Git that makes GitHub so useful. GitHub's focus on making
collaboration seamless and social catapulted it to its dominant
position. However, GitHub's market share might decline in the future
as the market for code development tools matures and engineers demand
more specialized tools for closed-source development.
