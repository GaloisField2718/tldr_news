 RISK METER BY LAUNCHDARKLY: A FREE TOOL FOR SOFTWARE RELEASE RISK
ASSESSMENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You're about to launch a highly-anticipated feature. What if it
glitches, doesn't load, or crashes your customer's environment?

This software release risk assessment [4] will help you avoid unhappy
customers, lost revenue, or catastrophes like recent news-making
outages and issues. Check your risk level now [4].

‚Üí Identify the easy-to-overlook risks that could be affecting your
feature releases.

‚Üí Find out which parts of your release strategy and system
monitoring practices are working well and which need to be improved.

‚Üí Get an informed overview of risks like poor user experience,
latency, and outages, and learn how to protect your customers from
them.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE STRANGE BEHAVIOR OF THE VOID TYPE IN TYPESCRIPT (6 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 In TypeScript, the `void` type signifies "nothing" and is mostly used
to declare the return type of functions. While you can declare a
variable as `void`, it's generally not recommended as it can only hold
the value `undefined`, making it impractical. Functions declared with
a `void` return type are expected to return `undefined`, either
explicitly or implicitly. However, due to how TypeScript handles
function type declarations and shorthand syntax, functions with a
`void` return type can actually return non-`undefined` values - it's
important to note that this is a special case to accommodate common
usage patterns. 

 THE RISE OF OPEN SOURCE TIME SERIES DATABASES (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Time series databases store and query data with timestamps, which is
useful for infrastructure monitoring, finance, and IoT applications.
These databases are an alternative to traditional relational
databases, especially when dealing with billions or trillions of data
points. The future of time series databases will likely involve
solutions for high cardinality, where a large number of unique data
points can strain performance, and time series churn, where frequently
changing data points can make historical analysis challenging.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TERENCE TAO: I HAVE PLAYED A LITTLE BIT WITH OPENAI'S NEW ITERATION
OF GPT, GPT-O1 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Terence Tao, a famous mathematician and UCLA professor, says that
OpenAI's GPT-o1 is getting closer to helping with advanced math tasks
and research. It successfully identified and applied Cramer's theorem
to solve a complex mathematical query, something that previous models
struggled with. However, it still needed lots of hints and prodding
for complex analysis problems. 

 MONOLITH FIRST (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A "monolith-first" strategy is better for building new applications,
even if microservices are anticipated later. Starting with a monolith
is more practical and less risky than starting with microservices due
to the significant overhead associated with managing a distributed
system. Also, it's hard to define stable service boundaries upfront,
making a monolith a better platform for experimentation and refining
boundaries before moving to a microservices architecture. 

 WHY YOU SHOULD "DESIGN IT TWICE"? (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Brainstorming at least two distinct designs when creating software
allows you to compare and identify the best solution and potentially
combine ideas from both. This requires more upfront effort, but
prevents costly rework later and improves design quality.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SECURITY LAYER FOR DEVELOPERS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Arcjet helps developers protect their apps in code (no agents
required). Implement bot protection, rate limiting, email validation,
PII detection, and defense against common attacks; test everything
locally so you don't break prod. Start free. [11] 

 VIOLENTMONKEY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Violentmonkey provides userscripts support for browsers. It works on
browsers with WebExtensions support. 

 AMPLIFY UI (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Amplify UI is an open-source library that offers a range of
customizable, accessible, and cloud-connected UI components. It has
connected components for streamlined cloud workflows, primitive
components for consistent branding, data-bound components for dynamic
data display, and various theming options. 

 CONFORM (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Conform is a type-safe form validation library for HTML forms. It
integrates with server frameworks like Remix and Next.js.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EX-CROWDSTRIKE EMPLOYEES DETAIL RISING TECHNICAL ERRORS BEFORE JULY
OUTAGE (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A report says that CrowdStrike prioritizes speed over quality, which
may be a reason behind the huge failure it had recently, which
paralyzed airlines and caused significant financial losses. Former
employees claim they repeatedly raised concerns about rushed
deadlines, insufficient training, and increasing technical problems,
but their warnings were ignored. The company disputes these claims,
stating that it is committed to quality control and that the
information came from disgruntled former employees. 

 GROUNDING AI IN REALITY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM DATA COMMONS (8
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google's DataGemma models address the issue of hallucinations in LLMs
by grounding them in real-world data from the Data Commons knowledge
graph. Two approaches are used: Retrieval Interleaved Generation (RIG)
and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RIG fine-tunes the model to
identify statistics and verify them against Data Commons, while RAG
retrieves relevant information before the LLM generates text. 

 EXPLORING THE SCALABLE MATRIX EXTENSION OF THE APPLE M4 PROCESSOR (16
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Apple M4 chip's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) unit can achieve
impressive peak compute rates for matrix multiplication. However, its
performance for vector operations is much lower due to limitations in
data movement. This is due to the architecture's reliance on tile
storage, where data needs to be moved from the CPU registers to the ZA
storage for optimal performance.
