 THE POSTMAN VS CODE EXTENSION JUST GOT A MAJOR OVERHAUL (SPONSOR) [6]


 API development just got a power boost with the latest features added
to the Postman VS Code extension:
üèÉ¬†Collection Runner [7]: Test API functionality by running a
collection‚Äôs requests in a specified sequence and logging the
results. Use scripts to pass data between requests and alter the
workflow.

üñ•Ô∏è¬†Postman Console [8]: Monitor network requests, track
responses, and effortlessly inspect variables to troubleshoot issues.
Now you can test and troubleshoot your APIs directly within the
comfort of your VS Code.

üìÑ¬†Enhanced Documentation: [9] Seamlessly view and edit
documentation for collections, folders, and requests right from your
VS Code.

_‚Üí _If you haven‚Äôt already tried it out, you can install the
Postman VS Code extension [5] from the VS Code marketplace.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SIMPLIFYING COMPLEXITY: THE JOURNEY FROM WEBSOCKETS TO HTTP STREAMS
(7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article discusses the need to capture tablet screen gestures and
transmit them to a browser for local actions. To do these actions, the
author initially considered using WebSockets for message exchange due
to their suitability for handling streams of messages. However,
WebSockets were hard to test and debug, so the author eventually moved
towards developing with HTTP streaming. HTTP streaming is a method
that Airbnb uses to improve its web performance too. 

 THE HIDDEN DEPTHS OF THE INPUT ELEMENT (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The HTML input element can be assigned 1 of 22 attributes, all of
which have different behaviors and purposes. This article covers some
of the lesser-known input attributes like inputmode, capture, and
more. It describes when and why you should use each of them for the
best user experience.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THREE TYPES OF AI-ASSISTED PROGRAMMERS (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While AI can generate code, it often produces mediocre results and
its reliability varies. For no-code entrepreneurs, AI can be enticing
but may hide underlying issues. Junior developers may benefit from AI
tools by learning and improving their skills. Senior engineers can use
AI to speed up coding tasks but should not sacrifice code quality for
velocity. Each type of programmer is given tips throughout the article
to utilize AI effectively as a tool. 

 BEHAVIOR BELONGS IN THE HTML (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article proposes the idea of using custom attributes, such as
"message," to extend the behavior of HTML elements like buttons. By
adding custom attributes to HTML elements, you can define their
behavior and functionality directly in the HTML markup, making the
code more readable and maintainable.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TEMPL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Templ is a way to convert Go into HTML UI. 

 BRICKSLLM (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 BricksLLM is a cloud-native AI gateway written in Go. It lets
developers create OpenAI API keys that have rate limits, cost limits,
and TTLs. These API keys can be used in both production and
development since they have fine-grained access control.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EXPLAINING CHATGPT TO ANYONE IN <20 MINUTES (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article introduces a three-part framework for understanding and
explaining generative LLMs. The first part covers decoder-only
transformer architecture, a deep neural network architecture used for
language tasks. The second part covers language model pretraining,
where these models are pretrained on large textual datasets using
self-supervised learning. The last part is the alignment process,
which makes LLMs more useful and aligned with human intent through
supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). 

 TEXT EDITOR DATA STRUCTURES: RETHINKING UNDO (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The concept of undo and redo operations in text editors needs
innovation in how they work. Using a graph-based data structure to
store undo/redo information allows for a more flexible and intuitive
way to navigate and visualize the editing history. Incorporating
diffing will show the changes between different editing states, making
it easier for users to understand the impact of undo/redo actions.

 IS REACT NATIVE STILL POPULAR? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [18] 

 A Hacker News commenter asks if React Native is still used in the
industry. Commenters respond with their thoughts, most of whom say
yes. However, there are a fair amount of people who also believe
native development is a better dev experience. 

 MOTIVATION ‚Äî THE SECRETS BEHIND HOW TO CREATE DRIVE IN YOURSELF AND
OTHERS (9 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Thoughts on motivation from a director who was genuinely surprised to
find a team that remained motivated and in order even when their
manager left. The team was used as an example to demonstrate the major
components of motivation (autonomy, mastery, purpose). This post
outlines tools you can use to build an energizing workspace. 

 FASTER TESTING WITH ANGULAR AND VITEST (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 There are many tools for running unit tests in Angular, and Vitest is
a new addition. Vitest is built on top of Vite and offers a host of
features including snapshot testing, Typescript support, and more.
This article explains how to quickly integrate Vitest with Angular and
includes code samples that will help you easily replicate the steps.
