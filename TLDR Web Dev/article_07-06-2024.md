ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW DEEP IS YOUR DOM? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Excessive DOM size in websites can negatively impact performance,
especially on lower-end devices. Deeper DOM trees, while not affecting
page load time significantly in a simple experiment, slow down
rendering when combined with many elements and complex CSS. This is
because the browser needs more time to calculate styles and update the
positions of each element, which potentially blocks the main thread
and makes the site unresponsive. 

 WHAT IS GOOGLE ZANZIBAR? (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google Zanzibar is a globally distributed authorization system
designed to address the complex access control needs of Google's
software ecosystem. It combines the granularity of Access Control
Lists (ACLs) with the simplicity of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
to make handling permissions simpler. By modeling permissions as data
in a graph, Zanzibar allows for querying and derivation of
relationships between objects. It uses standard functions like Read,
Write, Watch, Check, and Expand to interact with the graph, and a
tuple-based language to describe resources and relationships.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SOFTWARE MVPS CAN NO LONGER BE LOW QUALITY (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The traditional philosophy of shipping a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
with compromised quality is no longer viable in today's
software-saturated market. Software developers must focus on creating
truly differentiated products with exceptional craft and taste to
stand out from the competition as users have numerous alternatives
today. 

 COMPROMISED VISIONS ARE SUPERIOR (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Constraints can foster creativity and lead to better products. A
system where product owners set clear constraints on scope and time is
much better than unconstrained product backlogs that lead to
complexity and project overruns. 

 YOU SHOULD KEEP A DEVELOPER'S JOURNAL (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Keeping a developer's journal helps you write better code by forcing
you to clarify your goals and plan your work. It also helps you learn
from your experience by tracking your thought process and solutions to
problems.

 HOW I LEARNED VULKAN AND WROTE A SMALL GAME ENGINE WITH IT (45 MINUTE
READ) [14]

small game engine with it. The engine is suitable for smaller
level-based games and was initially a project for learning Vulkan.
They recommend starting with OpenGL and learning the latest OpenGL 4.6
practices before moving to Vulkan. 

 ADA LOVELACE'S 180-YEAR-OLD NOTES PREVIEWED THE FUTURE OF COMPUTERS
(6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Ada Lovelace's annotations to a paper about the analytical engine,
the world's first general-purpose computer, are considered
foundational to computer science. In her notes, Lovelace demonstrated
a deep understanding of the engine's capabilities and envisioned the
machine manipulating symbols according to rules to create music and
other forms of media. Despite her insights, the analytical engine was
never built due to a lack of funding.
