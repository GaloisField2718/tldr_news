ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SMARTER THAN 'CTRL+F': LINKING DIRECTLY TO WEB PAGE CONTENT (5 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Text fragments allow linking directly to specific text on a web page
without needing an ID using a special URL syntax that highlights the
desired text. They improve user experience by making deep linking
easier and can even reveal hidden content when matched. This feature
is supported in most modern browsers, with custom styling possible
through the ::target-text pseudo-element. 

 SERVER SIDE STATE MANAGEMENT IN NEXTJS: A DEEP DIVE INTO REACT CACHE
(11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 NextJS provides built-in tools like cache, unstable_cache, and
patched fetch for server-side state management, but these tools
require a shift in thinking from traditional client-side approaches.
There are benefits in using the mutable cache to manage server-side
state as it can simplify code by eliminating prop drilling. This
article goes into further detail about proper server-side caching with
examples. 

 OUR JOURNEY WITH CACHING (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Next.js's new experimental caching system uses two main concepts:
Suspense for dynamic data and "use cache" for static content. It
eliminates the need for complex configuration options and hidden
caches by providing a clear and consistent approach to managing data.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SELF-DOCUMENTING CODE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Self-documenting code is code that uses descriptive error messages,
named constants, and separate functions for complex logic.
Short-circuit evaluation can be used to streamline conditional
statements, and type annotations can be used with JSDoc comments for
better static type checking. 

 THROW MORE AI AT YOUR PROBLEMS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI applications can be improved by utilizing multiple, smaller LLM
calls instead of relying solely on one large model. A “compound AI
system" approach is one where each step in a workflow is handled by a
specialized, smaller model. This leads to better reliability,
cost-effectiveness, and overall quality. 

 DO'S AND DON'TS OF COMMENTING CODE (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When commenting code, use consistent commenting standards, explain
the "why" behind code rather than just the "what", and use annotations
like TODO and FIXME for clear communication. Also, avoid common
mistakes like commenting on obvious code, leaving outdated comments,
and including personal or informal remarks.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REACT NATIVE 0.76 - NEW ARCHITECTURE BY DEFAULT, REACT NATIVE
DEVTOOLS, AND MORE (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 React Native 0.76 has the New Architecture, which offers better
performance and native-like app development, enabled by default. The
release also introduces React Native DevTools, a new debugging
experience with familiar web-aligned tooling and improved integration
with React DevTools. React Native 0.76 also adds enhancements to
Metro, the module resolver, and new style props. 

 TYPESCHEMA (WEBSITE) [11] 

 TypeSchema is a JSON specification for describing data models. It has
easy-to-understand syntax, supports advanced concepts like inheritance
and generics, and allows for easy generation of clean and usable data
transfer objects. 

 GENERATIVE AI SCRIPTING (WEBSITE) [12] 

 GenAIScript is a JavaScript-based scripting environment by Microsoft
that provides tools and features for programmatically assembling
prompts for large language models. It lets developers build and
automate complex AI-powered workflows. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 NEW ARCHITECTURE IS HERE (22 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 React Native 0.76 introduces the New Architecture by default, a
complete rewrite of the core systems that underpin React Native. This
new architecture improves performance, enables full support for modern
React features like Suspense and Transitions, and allows for more
responsive user interfaces. It features a new Native Module system for
type-safe and synchronous communication between JavaScript and native
code, a rewritten Renderer that supports multiple threads and
concurrent rendering, and a well-defined Event Loop aligned with web
specifications. 

 THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE RUNS JAVASCRIPT, APPARENTLY (7 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 The James Webb Space Telescope uses JavaScript to control its
scientific instruments. This choice stems from the telescope's long
development timeline, which began in 1989, leading to the adoption of
technologies that were prevalent during the early 2000s. The core
script processor is written in C++.
