 HOW NOTION DECREASED LATENCY BY 20% WITH CACHING (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Notion recently improved its browser performance by using SQLite for
client-side caching. This led to a 20% increase in page navigation
speeds through a SharedWorker architecture to manage concurrency and
prevent database corruption. SQLite was implemented using WebAssembly
for local data storage and offline functionality. In this post, the
team at Notion goes through challenges they faced with slow disk reads
and initial page load times. 

 "WE RAN OUT OF COLUMNS" - THE BEST, WORST CODEBASE (11 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 This author recounts his experience working with a messy, yet
strangely enjoyable legacy codebase. The system was riddled with
quirks like a table with only one row used for generating IDs, a
manually-updated calendar that controlled logins, and a daily data
refresh process that could crash the system. The codebase itself was a
chaotic mix of technologies, including outdated frameworks and a
haphazardly built shipping application. Despite its flaws, the lack of
overarching design allowed for independent development and quick
fixes, which gave developers a sense of creative freedom. 

 PORTING MY JAVASCRIPT GAME ENGINE TO C FOR NO REASON (17 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The creator of the Impact JavaScript game engine rebuilt it in C and
called it high_impact. This new engine is designed for 2D action games
and runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and the web. high_impact utilizes a
simple framework with minimal code and is highly extensible, offering
support for tile-maps, entities, collision detection, and rendering
through OpenGL or a software renderer. The developer ported two of his
original Impact games, Biolab Disaster and Drop, to high_impact to
demonstrate the engine's functionality.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO BUILD ANYTHING EXTREMELY QUICKLY (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ‚ÄúOutline speedrunning‚Äù is a technique for accelerating the
building process of any project. It involves recursively outlining a
project into smaller and smaller components, then filling in these
components as quickly as possible without focusing on perfection. Only
after completing all components does one go back and refine the work,
resulting in a faster and less stressful process. This approach is
significantly faster than the traditional "loading bar" style of
building, which involves working through the project sequentially. 

 HOW TO GET PROMOTED (WITHOUT GETTING LUCKY) (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Promotions to Staff Engineer focus on sustained, measurable impact
aligned with company goals, often demonstrated over at least six
months. Leveraging people, writing, and high-quality code multiplies
your influence, differentiating higher-level ICs from others. Building
a strong internal brand through quality work, collaboration, and
effective communication is necessary. 

 HOW I USE "AI" (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 LLMs are already providing tangible value, contrary to the claims of
many who consider them just hype. This post details how the author
uses LLMs to simplify code, automate boring tasks, provide API
references, search for things difficult to find, explain concepts,
solve one-off tasks, and various other tasks. While LLMs might not be
able to solve complex or novel problems, their ability to handle
mundane tasks can significantly improve productivity and allow
developers to focus on the interesting aspects of their work.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 üëâ GET 80% AUTOMATED E2E TEST COVERAGE IN WEEKS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Over 2/3rd of dev teams test less than 50% of their workflows,
causing bugs to sneak out. QA Wolf [11] gets your organization to 80%
automated E2E test coverage in weeks, not years.

They create and maintain your test suite in open-source Playwright.
Plus, they provide unlimited parallel test runs [11] on their
infrastructure (24-hour maintenance included).

The results? With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [12] achieved
4x more test cases and 86% faster QA cycles.

‚≠ê Rated 4.8/5 on G2.

 ELL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Ell is a command-line interface for LLMs written in Bash. You can
chat with LLMs and have them call functions through your terminal. 

 PLAIN VANILLA (WEBSITE) [14] 

 Plain Vanilla is an explainer for doing web development using only
vanilla techniques. This means no tools and no frameworks ‚Äî just
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

 MORPHIC (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Morphic is an AI-powered search engine with a generative UI.

MISCELLANEOUS

 USING YOUR KINDLE AS AN E-INK MONITOR (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This developer jailbroke their Kindle Paperwhite to use as an e-ink
monitor. The process involved jailbreaking the Kindle, setting up a
listener server on it to receive image files, and using screen capture
and image manipulation tools to send images from a computer to the
Kindle. 

 SHOULD YOU AVOID BARREL FILES FOR BETTER CODEBASE CONSISTENCY AND
PERFORMANCE? (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Avoiding barrel files can prevent issues like circular imports and
improve development speed by reducing unnecessary module loading.
Consistency in file organization can be enforced by lint rules like
`import/no-cycle`. A single casing format for filenames is useful for
team style guides. While barrel files may be necessary for libraries,
they often complicate application code and should be avoided. 

 WHAT WE GOT WRONG ABOUT HTTP IMPORTS (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Deno's initial HTTP imports aimed to simplify JavaScript development
by using distributed URLs instead of a centralized registry, but this
approach faced issues like long URLs, cumbersome dependency
management, and reliability concerns. Deno introduced Import Maps and
JSR to address these problems, offering better version management and
reliability while maintaining the benefits of granular, HTTP-based
module loading.

enhancing their type safety and usability through features like direct
initialization from underlying types, the 'using enum' keyword, and
the std::to_underlying utility.
