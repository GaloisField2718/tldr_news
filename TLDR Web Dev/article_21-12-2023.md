 THE PITFALLS OF MEASURING DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY, AND HOW TO USE THE
DEVELOPER THRIVING FRAMEWORK (SPONSOR) [6] 

 Developer productivity is meant to measure ability to produce and
deliver adept code directly related to a company‚Äôs business
outcomes. In practice, most companies fixate on surface definitions,
incentivize the wrong behaviors [6], or fall into measurement
paralysis.
This blog post by Pluralsight [6] introduces the Developer Thriving
framework [6] ‚Äî a new way to measure productivity that‚Äôs focused
on agency, learning, motivation and efficiency, support and belonging.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FETCH WATERFALL IN REACT (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A ‚Äúfetch waterfall‚Äù is a common data fetching issue in React. It
happens when you create a hierarchy of components that fetch their own
data and show ‚Äúloading‚Äù states before child components are
rendered. There are a couple of ways to resolve this: by fetching data
from the server (it‚Äôs not always as simple as using a server
component), hoisting the data fetching to a higher level component, or
through Suspense, which triggers the whole component tree‚Äôs fetches
in parallel. 

 BUILDING A FASTER HASH TABLE FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE SQL JOINS (11
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article introduces a specialized hash table called FastMap used
for hash joins and aggregate handling. FastMap takes an unconventional
approach to speeding up SQL execution by using various hash functions
(shown through code examples). Benchmarks show how FastMap is faster
than standard Java Hashmaps. 

 MAKING SOFTWARE RELIABLE: THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTABILITY (9 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Testability refers to how easily software can be tested. It plays a
crucial role in identifying and fixing errors, ensuring software
reliability. This article discusses automated testing basics,
including unit tests, integration tests, and system tests, with
examples in Go. It also highlights design principles for enhancing
testability, such as modular design, the use of interfaces, and
dependency injection.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ALL CODE IS TECHNICAL DEBT (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Technical debt is the idea that rushing software development for
short-term gains can lead to future slowdowns. Features add to this
debt, so their value must outweigh the debt they introduce. Once
added, features are challenging to remove, making it crucial to work
within existing assumptions to minimize debt. 

 ADVICE FOR NEW SOFTWARE DEVS WHO'VE READ ALL THOSE OTHER ADVICE
ESSAYS (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 It‚Äôs important to critically evaluate advice, considering that
software development is not an extensively researched field. It‚Äôs
better to try out different approaches and learn from experience. A
good way to get better at software engineering is to understand the
context and origins of best practices and conventions, take walks to
refresh the mind, and explore the hidden depths of the tools used in
programming. 

 THE 7 RULES FOR SUCCESSFUL JOB HOPPING IN DATA ENGINEERING (13 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 The author of this article went from being a junior data engineer to
a staff engineer at big tech companies like Facebook, Netflix, and
Airbnb. He outlines seven rules for successful job hopping in data
engineering, including rapid onboarding, focusing on high-priority
work, measurable impact, and not forcing promotions when your manager
doesn't support it. He also shares experiences from job interviews,
promotions, and the skills he acquired along the way.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BUILD A SEARCH ENGINE, NOT A VECTOR DB (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Vector database startups have proliferated in the last 12 months.
However, vector databases should not be solely seen as a way to expand
a language model's memory, but rather should be thought of as a
specialized search engine. While embeddings and vector search can
enhance search results, building a robust search engine with a
combination of high-quality embeddings and traditional search methods
is a better approach to utilizing AI well. 

 USING STRONGLY TYPED VS. STATICALLY TYPED CODE (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Strongly typed languages enforce strict type rules, ensuring that
variables adhere to their defined types, while statically typed
languages require explicit type declarations for variables during
compilation. Statically typed languages catch type errors early in
development, enhancing code reliability. TypeScript is a language that
combines strong and static typing, providing a balance between type
safety and flexibility.
