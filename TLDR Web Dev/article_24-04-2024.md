page load times and user action responsiveness online are often

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE MAN WHO KILLED GOOGLE SEARCH (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google Search's search quality has been reportedly declining since
2019 due to revenue pressures. In 2020, Prabhakar Raghavan, the former
head of Yahoo Search, replaced Ben Gomes, a dedicated search engineer
who prioritized user experience, as the head of Google Search.
Raghavan's focus on advertising and growth metrics prioritized profit
over search quality, leading to more ad-heavy search. 

 HELP US INVENT CSS GRID LEVEL 3, AKA ‚ÄúMASONRY‚Äù LAYOUT (20 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 A potential implementation of CSS Grid Level 3 called the ‚ÄúMasonry
layout‚Äù allows for much more flexibility in designing web pages.
Developers would be able to define grid columns, use subgrid
functionalities, and explicitly place grid items. Level 3 is still
being developed, so the WebKit team is inviting feedback from the web
development community to guide the direction of this CSS
specification. 

 APPLE'S RISKY BET ON CARPLAY (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Apple's latest version of CarPlay deeply integrates with a car's
entire infotainment system. While some carmakers are excited to
partner with Apple, others see CarPlay 2 as a threat to their own
software platforms and brands. Apple has to balance control over the
user experience with carmaker desires, while carmakers need to see how
much CarPlay is a factor in car buying decisions.
