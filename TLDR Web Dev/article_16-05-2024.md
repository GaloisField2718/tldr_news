ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILD YOUR OWN REACT.JS IN 400 LINES OF CODE (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This article explains how to build a simplified version of React with
400 lines of code. The simplified React utilizes Fiber architecture
and concurrency mode to avoid blocking the main thread during
rendering. It is able to execute tasks during browser idle time. It
uses a linked list structure to connect work units and triggers
updates through a custom useState implementation. 

 HOW FACEBOOK SERVED BILLIONS OF REQUESTS PER SECOND USING MEMCACHED
(8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Facebook used Memcached, a key-value store, to efficiently handle
billions of requests per second. It achieved this by scaling Memcached
at three levels: cluster, region, and worldwide. It used parallel
requests and batching, optimized client-server communication, and
managed congestion effectively to reduce latency. ‚ÄúMemcache pools‚Äù
were used to reduce load on their databases. 

 MAKING A POSTGRES QUERY 1,000 TIMES FASTER (18 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This developer discovered a significant performance issue in a
database query used for indexing posts in their application
Mattermost. The query was initially slow due to too much filtering,
but was sped up by using PostgreSQL's row constructor comparisons. To
help find this speed boost, the developer used the BUFFERS option in
EXPLAIN statements for detailed insights and prioritized Index Cond
over Filter for efficient queries.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED MICROSERVICES (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Microservices are popular and great for scalability and team
organization, but can bring problems to smaller organizations. Too
many services can be hard to maintain, create excessive
interdependencies, and make downsizing difficult in tough economic
times. 

 HOW NOT TO DO CODE REVIEWS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Traditional code reviews, which focus on manually finding errors,
have become a bottleneck for engineering teams. With advancements in
automated testing and static code analyzers, code reviews can now
shift their focus from error-finding to knowledge sharing and
long-term codebase health. 

 I CODED SOMETHING DUMB AND I'M PROUD OF IT (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This developer added a quicksort animation feature to a game to
visually sort items while handling potential changes in the list being
sorted. Instead of optimizing the quicksort algorithm to resume from
its last state, the developer chose a simpler, inefficient solution
(on purpose): the sorting illusion is created by repeatedly running
the algorithm from the start until a change occurs.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW I MADE MY GITHUB PROFILE README DYNAMIC (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 You can add a README to your profile repository by naming it the same
as your GitHub username. GitHub Actions can be used to integrate
dynamic content such as real-time statistics and latest blog posts
using tools like `github-readme-stats` and `metrics`. 

 THE CARCINIZATION OF WEB FRAMEWORKS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 JavaScript frameworks have evolved and converged towards a common set
of features, such as immutability for developer experience and code
stability, single-directional data flow for simplified state
management, signals for granular reactivity, and server-side rendering
(SSR) for improved SEO and performance.
