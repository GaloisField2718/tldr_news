ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REAL-TIME MOUSE POINTERS (18 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Canva's collaboration team implemented real-time mouse pointers to
make its whiteboard product better. Initially, they utilized a
backend-centric architecture using WebSockets and Redis, which scaled
to support hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users, but had
limitations in update rate. Recognizing these limitations, the team
migrated to a WebRTC-based architecture, which allowed direct
peer-to-peer communication between clients, reducing latency and
improving scalability. 

 DEPENDENCY INJECTION IN REACT - HOW TO MANAGE DEPENDENCIES IN YOUR
REACT APP FOR CLEANER AND EASIER TO MAINTAIN CODE (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that improves
flexibility, testability, and maintainability by injecting external
dependencies into your code rather than hard-coding them. In React
applications, DI can be implemented using createContext and useContext
to manage dependencies across components without prop drilling. This
approach simplifies testing, makes code less coupled, and provides
better separation of concerns, though it does add some complexity.
