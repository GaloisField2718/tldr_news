ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REACT'S EXPERIMENTAL ANIMATIONS API (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 React's first animation API, `ViewTransition`, is built upon the
browser's View Transition API. It offers animation capabilities
previously unavailable in React. The View Transition API has
limitations like uninterruptible animations and complex pseudo-element
management. `ViewTransition` fixes these by integrating deeply with
React's render cycle and using asynchronous updates. 

 FIVE YEARS OF REACT NATIVE AT SHOPIFY (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Shopify successfully transitioned all its mobile apps to React Native
over five years. This decision resulted in blazing-fast and stable
apps, exceeding its performance goals. While it still had common React
Native challenges like debugging and updates, Shopify found the
benefits of React Native, like hot reloading and Typescript's
contribution to talent flexibility, very useful. 

 TYPESCRIPT WITHOUT BUILD TOOLS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Many tools today natively support TypeScript, including frameworks
(e.g., Next.js, Astro), runtimes (e.g., Deno, Bun), and bundlers
(e.g., Vite, Parcel), reducing the need for custom configuration. With
Node.js soon supporting TypeScript by default, the ecosystem is
shifting toward making TypeScript integration a standard.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE RIGHT TO ROOT ACCESS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Consumers should have the “right to root access,” which means
they have the freedom to install any software on devices they own
outright regardless of the device type. Currently, manufacturers often
lock bootloaders and restrict software installation for “security
reasons.” 

 20 LINES OF CODE THAT WILL BEAT A/B TESTING EVERY TIME (7 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A/B testing is inefficient and flawed because it sacrifices user
experience for data. A better alternative is the "multi-armed bandit"
algorithm, specifically the epsilon-greedy method, which allows for
simultaneous testing of multiple options and dynamically optimizes
choices based on real-time performance.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW ELASTIC USES SEMANTIC RERANKING FOR SEARCH AND RAG (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Semantic reranking often improves relevance, particularly in a
zero-shot setting, and can also be used to trade-off indexing compute
cost for querying compute cost. This blog post [9] introduces semantic
reranking and how it can fit into your search and RAG pipelines. Read
it on Elastic Search Labs [9] 

 WERK (WEBSITE) [10] 

 werk is a new build system written in Rust that addresses
shortcomings found in existing tools like make and just. These
shortcomings include unreliable handling in spaces in file paths and
cross-platform compatibility. werk is a simpler, more portable, and
easier-to-debug alternative for building complex projects, especially
video games. 

 TRIMMIDDLE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 trimMiddle shortens strings by removing characters from the middle
and replacing them with a specified filler. It handles emojis
correctly.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WORDPRESS IS IN TROUBLE (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The legal battle between WordPress's creator Matt Mullenweg and WP
Engine has caused a lot of issues in the WordPress community.
Mullenweg's actions, including a prolonged WordPress.org holiday break
and a drastic reduction in Automattic's open-source contributions,
have led to community unrest. This has led to the resignation of key
members from the WordPress Sustainability committee. 

 TESTING ACCESSIBILITY WITH SCREEN READERS (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Screen readers rely on the accessibility tree to help users with
disabilities navigate and interact with web apps, providing
information about element roles, labels, states, and hierarchy. Proper
accessibility testing involves using multiple screen readers,
double-checking proper keyboard navigation, focus management,
descriptive labels, and dynamic content announcements. 

 MODERN SQLITE FOR REACT NATIVE APPS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Expo SQLite and Drizzle can be used together to make using a local
database in React Native. The combination offers type safety and
developer-friendly abstractions, removing the need for raw SQL queries
(though they still can be used) and manual schema management.

 2024 JAVASCRIPT RISING STARS (WEBSITE) [15] 

 2024 saw advancements in JavaScript tooling, including new and
improved frameworks, package managers, and runtimes, but the most
impactful changes were the emergence of AI-powered tools capable of
generating and deploying entire applications. 

 5 TIPS TO EFFECTIVELY OPTIMIZE INP IN REACT (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Optimizing Interaction to Next Paint (INP) in React apps can be done
by reducing DOM size, dividing components into simple and extended
versions, using `Suspense`, handling hydration errors, and carefully
using `useEffect()`. 

 CHEATING IS ALL YOU NEED (22 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 LLMs offer a productivity boost by automating a large portion of
coding tasks.
