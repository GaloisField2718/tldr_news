 HOW TO ACTUALLY USE CODING AGENTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Autonomous coding agents are everywhere: Devin, Codex, Jules, etc.
But how do you actually use them?

The Devin team just shared their proven playbook for _any_ coding
agent here [4].

Key theme: how to 10x productivity & STOP SHIPPING AI SLOP.

Want to try? The $20 SOC 2-COMPLIANT Core plan for Devin is a great
way to get started [5].

DEVIN IS FOR SERIOUS SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. It works where your team
does—Jira, Linear, Slack, GitHub, GitLab, and via API.

NOT A TOY: it's built for real-world engineering, not vibecoding.
Customers like Ramp use Devin [6] to save 10,000+ hours/month.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REVERSE ENGINEERING VERCEL'S BOTID (23 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Vercel's BotID is an anti-bot solution, which in its Basic mode uses
client-side signals to detect bots. Basic mode uses obfuscated
JavaScript to collect browser fingerprints and detect automation
frameworks, but the current implementation appears to be passive,
collecting data rather than actively blocking bots. Deep Analysis mode
uses an anti-bot system by Kasada, which is a software security
company. 

 FINDING PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS BY DIFFING TWO GO PROFILES (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The DoltHub team had a mysterious 3x performance regression while
working on Doltgres (a version-controlled Postgres-compatible
database) compatibility with SQLAlchemy. They used Go's pprof tool to
diff performance profiles between branches, which revealed that a
hard-coded parameter was unnecessarily calling an expensive method to
generate system table names on every table lookup.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THERE ARE NO NEW IDEAS IN AI… ONLY NEW DATASETS (11 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Major AI breakthroughs aren't driven by novel ideas, but rather by
unlocking new datasets. The core mechanisms behind recent advancements
have existed for a while, so major progress happens when AI can learn
from previously untapped sources like ImageNet, the internet, human
feedback, and verifiers. The next paradigm shift won't come from
better algorithms, but from harnessing data from video or embodied
systems like robots. 

 THE NEW SKILL IN AI IS NOT PROMPTING, IT'S CONTEXT ENGINEERING (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Unlike prompt engineering, context engineering designs dynamic
systems that deliver the right information and tools at the right time
for LLMs to accomplish tasks. This means structuring various forms of
context, like instructions, short and long-term memory, retrieved
data, and available tools, into a properly detailed input. The quality
of this context is necessary to better AI agents. 

 REACT STILL FEELS INSANE AND NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT (14 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 React has become overly complex and confusing to use. The
components-based architecture coupled with features like React Hooks
leads to convoluted state management and hard-to-parse code. Part of
this complexity is due to the inherent challenge of building reactive
UIs with many inputs and outputs, rather than it being a
React-specific problem. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CLAUDE CODE HOOKS (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that extend Claude
Code's behavior by executing at specific points in its lifecycle.
These hooks offer control over actions like notifications, code
formatting, logging, feedback, and custom permissions. They can be
configured in JSON settings files (user, project, and local) and can
be organized by event type (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, and
Stop) and matchers. 

 REACT NATIVE NITRO IMAGE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 React Native Nitro Image is a high-performance image processing
library built with Nitro. It provides an instance-based Image type
with pixel data access and supports in-memory operations like resizing
and cropping. The library has fast web image loading and caching using
SDWebImage (iOS) and Coil (Android), along with ThumbHash support for
placeholders. 

 CERTMATE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 CertMate is an open-source SSL certificate management system designed
for modern infra, with multi-DNS provider support, Docker
containerization, and a REST API. It automates certificate renewal. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 TESTING OPENAI CODEX AND COMPARING IT TO CLAUDE CODE (8 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 OpenAI Codex and Claude Code can both be used as command-line AI
coding assistants. This developer tested them on a JSON file merging
task. Codex successfully completed the task with detailed
explanations, while Claude Code wasn't able to. Though Codex was less
transparent about its process, it was powerful and successful, which
means it may be more useful for experienced devs over vibe coders. 

 RELIABILITY FOR UNRELIABLE LLMS (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 As generative AI becomes more integrated into software, these systems
will end up inheriting the unreliable, non-deterministic nature of
LLMs. This isn't great for enterprise software that requires reliable,
predictable results, which means companies need to implement
guardrails on inputs/outputs, filtering mechanisms, and specialized
observability tools to monitor AI behavior.

QUICK LINKS

 I WRITE TYPE SAFE GENERIC DATA STRUCTURES IN C (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Unions and macros in C can be used to create type-safe generic data
structures like linked lists, maps, and arrays, which allows for
compile-time type checking and better memory management. 

 PREFER GAPS TO MARGINS (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Gaps in CSS are better than margins for spacing elements in layouts
because gaps are applied by parent containers (using Flexbox or Grid)
to space their children, while margins are applied to individual
elements, requiring more manual code management. 

 DON'T BE ASHAMED TO SAY "I DON'T KNOW": THE QUIET POWER OF HONESTY (3
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Admitting "I don't know" is better for creating trust with others and
is better for learning. 

 SNAPAI (GITHUB REPO) [20] 

 SnapAI is an AI-powered CLI tool for React Native & Expo devs to
generate app icons quickly using OpenAI's image generation models.
