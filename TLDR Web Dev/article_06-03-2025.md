ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 {TRANSITIONS} = F(STATE) (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 React components can be viewed as defining a state machine, where the
UI and valid state transitions are functions of the current state
({transitions} = f(state)). Asynchronous and concurrent updates in
React can create situations where users can trigger invalid updates
because the UI doesn't immediately reflect the new state. To prevent
this, devs should use optimistic or pending updates that flush
synchronously to the DOM, making sure that the UI accurately reflects
the valid transitions. 

 WEB SCRAPING WITH PLAYWRIGHT (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Playwright is a tool often used for end-to-end testing, but can be
used for web scraping dynamic websites. Unlike other libraries,
Playwright opens websites in a real browser, allowing it to scrape
content rendered by JavaScript. This article walks through an example
of scraping YouTube for video titles, URLs, and the number of likes,
while also navigating through multiple pages at a time. 

 BUILDING APIS WITH NEXT.JS (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This post goes over how to set up a Next.js project with an example
route, explains how to use Route Handlers for different HTTP methods,
and explores working with Web APIs, dynamic routing, and reusable
middleware. It also discusses deployments for both standard Node.js
environments and static SPA exports.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 50 THINGS WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT BUILDING SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS (12 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Building successful products at PostHog came from having small,
autonomous teams empowered to make decisions based on user feedback
and metrics. Trust, transparency, and a focus on shipping fast are
necessary, with product engineers playing an important role in
understanding user needs and iterating quickly. 

 TAILSCALE IS PRETTY USEFUL (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tailscale is a service that creates a virtual private network for
easy device access. This developer found that Tailscale's free tier
was really generous for their use cases, which needed simple remote
connections, file sharing, and exit node functionality. 

 THE ART OF TECH INTERVIEWING (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Exceptional candidates think aloud, use uncertainty to demonstrate
clarity, and prioritize problem-solving over immediate perfection.
They also showcase their authenticity, reframe failures as learning
opportunities, and practice structured adaptability to handle
unpredictable challenges.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SEMANTIC SEARCH USING ELASTIC'S OPEN CRAWLER AND SEMANTIC TEXT
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Follow this tutorial [10] to learn how to easily configure and run a
website crawl with Open Crawler, automatically chunk and generate
sparse vector embeddings with ELSER for the crawled web content (blog
text), and run a few sample searches to ensure everything's working.
Read more on the Elastic Search Labs blog [10] 

 LYNX (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Lynx is a new cross-platform technology from TikTok that allows devs
to create native UIs for mobile and web from a single codebase. It is
currently used in various TikTok apps, from lightweight panels to
complex e-commerce storefronts, and is now being open-sourced. 

 ANNOUNCING TANSTACK FORM V1 (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 TanStack Form v1 is a stable, production-ready form library with
support for React, Vue, Angular, Solid, and Lit. It has extreme type
safety, schema validation (Zod, Valibot, ArkType), and asynchronous
validation with built-in debouncing. 

 MALIBU (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Malibu is a native ESM middleware for Node.js that helps protect web
apps from CSRF attacks. It's designed to work with frameworks like
Express, Tinyhttp, and Polka, and it depends on either Cookie Parser
or Session middleware. The middleware allows devs to acquire CSRF
tokens and provides options for configuration, including middleware
type, cookie settings, and token location.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TRIMODAL NATURE OF TECH COMPENSATION IN THE US, UK, AND INDIA (28
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The US is unique in having a tier above Big Tech. Across the UK,
India, and the Netherlands, the highest compensation is Big Tech, but
in the US, hedge funds, quant firms, and top scaleups can pay more.
However, these positions are usually reserved for workers already in
Big Tech, and switching can be difficult. It's a lot harder now to get
into top-tier companies in today's tough job market. 

 APPLE REVEALS M3 ULTRA, TAKING APPLE SILICON TO A NEW EXTREME (13
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apple has announced the M3 Ultra chip, its highest-performing chip
ever. Designed for heavily threaded and bandwidth-intensive
applications, the M3 Ultra has a 32-core CPU, an 80-core GPU, a
doubled Neural Engine, and support for up to 512GB of unified memory.
It also incorporates Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, with more than double
the bandwidth per port for faster data transfer. 

 SIGNALS IN REACT? NOT A GOOD IDEA (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 While Signals in React offer efficiency and direct UI updates,
React's component-based, coarse-grained reactivity model makes it
difficult to implement them effectively. There are practical problems
like handling data rawness, conditionals, and loops, as well as
conceptual issues with React's fundamental re-rendering approach.
