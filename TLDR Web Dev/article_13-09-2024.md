 NOTES ON OPENAI'S NEW O1 CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT MODELS (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has released two new "chain-of-thought" models, o1-preview and
o1-mini, which prioritize reasoning over speed and cost. These models
are trained to think step-by-step, enabling them to handle more
complex prompts requiring backtracking and deeper analysis. While the
reasoning process is hidden from users due to safety and competitive
advantage concerns, it allows for improved results in tasks like
generating Bash scripts, solving crossword puzzles, and validating
data.

 LEARNING TO REASON WITH LLMS (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI o1 is a new large language model trained to reason by
generating a chain of thought before responding. This model
demonstrates significant advancements in reasoning capabilities,
achieving impressive performance in various tasks, including
competitive programming, math Olympiads, and scientific
problem-solving. OpenAI o1-preview is now available for use in ChatGPT

abilities. 

 AN UNPOPULAR PERSPECTIVE ON THE SSO TAX (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The so-called "SSO Tax" in SaaS pricing is not an unfair practice but
rather a form of price discrimination that is both logical and
beneficial for both vendors and customers. Price discrimination is
inherent in any market, as buyers have different preferences and
willingness to pay. Vendors need to segment their customers to
maximize their revenue. For example, airlines have different pricing
tiers that allow vendors to offer more affordable basic tiers while
still catering to the needs of high-paying customers.
