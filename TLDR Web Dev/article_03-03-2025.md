 CATCH THE BEST MINDS IN PRODUCT & ENGINEERING LEADERSHIP AT SWARMIA
CIRCLE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 On March 27, seasoned engineering and product leaders will take the
(virtual) stage at Swarmia Circle, a half-day event [4] centered on
the 3 pillars of engineering effectiveness: business outcomes,
developer productivity, and developer experience.

You'll hear from:

 	* John Cutler, Head of Product at Dotwork and the author of The
Beautiful Mess Substack
 	* Nathen Harvey, DORA Lead at Google Cloud
 	* Meri Williams, CTO of fintech scaleup Pleo

☝️ If you're interested in building a more effective engineering
organization in 2025 and beyond, you don't want to miss this event.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 USING AI IN THE BROWSER FOR TYPO REWRITING (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Chrome's new built-in AI APIs can be used to correct typos in user
input. This article experiments with both the general-purpose Prompt
API and the Rewriter API, providing code snippets and examples of
their performance on deliberately misspelled text. The Prompt API
produced cleaner, but slightly altered results, while the Rewriter API
stayed closer to the original phrasing but sometimes failed to correct
all errors. 

 ABUSING C TO IMPLEMENT JSON PARSING WITH STRUCT METHODS (14 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A memory-safe JSON parser can be made in C using struct methods for a
more ergonomic API. The parser represents JSON values using a
`json_value` struct with unions for different data types and includes
functions for freeing memory and printing the parsed structure. The
parsing process combines lexing and parsing into a single pass,
handling atoms (numbers, null, true, false), strings, arrays, and
objects with helper functions for whitespace skipping and error
handling. 

 CROSS-SITE REQUESTS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 By default, browsers allow cross-site write requests but restrict
cross-site reads, a behavior governed by the Same-Origin Policy. CORS
is a mechanism to selectively allow cross-origin requests, while CSRF
protection uses tokens to verify the legitimacy of requests. CSRF
protection is especially important for simple POST requests allowed
cross-site. 

🧠 

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 API DESIGN NOTE: BEWARE OF ADDING AN "OTHER" ENUM VALUE (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Including an "Other" enum value can create too much ambiguity as new
enum values are added later. Returning new values contradicts the
meaning of "Other" as "not mentioned elsewhere." Instead, document the
enum as open-ended, letting each application define its own "Other"
category for unrecognized values. 

 SPEEDRUNNERS ARE VULNERABILITY RESEARCHERS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Video game speedrunners use reverse engineering, static/dynamic
analysis, and custom tooling to discover and exploit game glitches,
which is similar to techniques used by cybersecurity professionals.
Their skills translate directly to valuable security roles and should
be used more often for testing security in software in general. 

 WHY WE DITCHED NEXT.JS AND NEVER LOOKED BACK (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Northflank ditched Next.js because they found it had negative SEO
impacts for them, poor performance at scale, and also was a "black
box" during debugging. They replaced it with a custom React SSR
solution using Express. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BLAFS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 BLAFS is a bloat-aware filesystem that reduces container size by
identifying and removing unused files, leading to smaller, faster, and
still functional containers. 

 MAESTRO (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Maestro is a UI testing framework for mobile and web apps. It
addresses flakiness and delays inherent in mobile testing with
built-in tolerance and fast iteration. The framework uses a
declarative YAML syntax, has a simple setup with a single binary, and
is open-source.

MISCELLANEOUS

 I STRUGGLED WITH GIT, SO I'M MAKING A GAME TO SPARE OTHERS THE PAIN
(13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 After struggling with Git, this developer created Git-Sim to
visualize Git commands, but realized it only helped those already
familiar with Git. To make Git more accessible, they created Devlands,
a voxel-world game where users can explore Git concepts and codebases
in an immersive, tangible way. Devlands has a Git tutorial and a
freeform mode to interact with files, commits, and branches within the
game world. 

 HOW TO GAIN CODE EXECUTION ON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND HUNDREDS OF
POPULAR APPS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A security researcher discovered a vulnerability in todesktop, an
Electron app bundler service, that could allow remote code execution
on millions of users of popular applications like ClickUp, Cursor, and
Linear. The researcher found hardcoded Firebase credentials and
secrets within todesktop's deployment pipeline, letting them push
malicious auto-updates to any application using the service. They
promptly reported the issue to todesktop, who quickly implemented a
fix involving a privileged sidecar for signing and uploading. 

 XCODE CONSTANTLY PHONES HOME (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Slow Xcode builds can often be due to unnecessary connections to
developerservices2.apple.com during the "Gather provisioning inputs"
phase. This developer blocked these connections with Little Snitch,
which sped up builds. He also found that Xcode connects to
devimages-cdn.apple.com on launch and appstoreconnect.apple.com
whenever an Xcode project is opened, likely to send data to Apple.

QUICK LINKS

 JAVASCRIPT FATIGUE STRIKES BACK (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Despite advancements in JavaScript tooling and the unification of
client and server-side rendering, the sheer amount of JavaScript
frameworks and the challenges of choosing the right one continue to
create "JavaScript fatigue" for developers. 

 MY EXPERIMENTS WITH WASM AND OPENGL (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This developer, with no prior OpenGL experience, rendered 1 million
dynamic, lit, and textured spheres at 60 FPS by porting a C++ OpenGL
implementation to WASM/WebGL after encountering performance issues on
their local machine. 

 RE: VSCODE EXTENSION DRAMA (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 VSCode has a lack of transparency and inconsistently applies security
measures in remotely uninstalling an extension based on a potentially
flawed threat analysis. 

 MAKING O1, O3, AND SONNET 3.7 HALLUCINATE FOR EVERYONE (3 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 A developer discovered that LLMs like ChatGPT sometimes suggest a
non-existent syntax for dynamically preloading associations in Rails,
which ironically originated from a flawed idea they themselves posted
on a Rails forum years ago.
