ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 LIQUID GLASS, BUT IN CSS (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This article explains how to recreate Apple's new “Liquid Glass”
design language from WWDC25 using CSS and SVG filters. The effect can
be broken down into layers with box-shadows, backdrop-filter blur,
color adjustments, and complex SVG displacement maps for refraction
simulation. However, the implementation shown only works in Chrome,
requires a lot of GPU resources, and is only practical for hero
elements rather than full UI due to performance constraints. 

 A GUIDE TO SCROLL-DRIVEN ANIMATIONS WITH JUST CSS (11 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Scroll-driven animations can be implemented in CSS, allowing
animations to be controlled by user scrolling instead of time. There
are three key components: the target element, the keyframes defining
the animation, and the timeline (either `scroll()` or `view()`) that
links the animation to scrolling. The `scroll()` timeline triggers
animations based on scrolling, while `view()` activates them when an
element enters the viewport. 

 OPENTELEMETRY FOR GO: MEASURING THE OVERHEAD (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Everything comes at a cost, even logging. This article benchmarks
logging overhead in a Go HTTP server that handles over 10k
requests/second. It finds that enabling OpenTelemetry increased CPU
usage by 35% (from 2 to 2.7 cores), memory by 50% (10MB to 15-18MB),
and p99 latency from 10ms to 15ms while adding 4MB/second of network
traffic for telemetry export.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 START ALONE, THEN TOGETHER: WHY SOFTWARE MODELLING NEEDS SOLITARY
BRAINSTORMING (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Software modeling sessions often suffer from the "CTO effect," where
dominant voices override other useful perspectives. To counter this,
it's better to start modeling sessions with 10-15 minutes of silent,
solitary brainstorming to encourage everyone to generate ideas
independently first. 

 PREPARING FOR GOOGLE ZERO (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google is declining as a reliable traffic source due to AI-powered
search. Its new approach uses creators' work to compete against them
without compensation, breaking the traditional SEO model that rewards
valuable content with traffic. To adapt, businesses needing
distribution need to start looking into niche communities, referral
programs, conferences, audio content, and word-of-mouth marketing.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DID THAT LAST MODEL UPDATE BREAK YOUR APPLICATION? LEARN TO DEBUG AI
IN PRODUCTION (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Join the Sentry team for the latest Sentry Build hands-on workshop
[9]. This month, you'll be debugging AI-integrated applications and
agents. Identify model misbehavior that breaks your application,
untangle workflows that stopped working with that last model update,
and solve other AI-specific debugging riddles. Join live on July 9.

 GEMINI CLI: YOUR OPEN-SOURCE AI AGENT (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Gemini CLI is an open-source AI agent that brings Gemini directly to
your terminal. It has generous free usage limits, with access to
Gemini 2.5 Pro and up to 60 free model requests per minute. It also
has Google Search integration and Model Context Protocol support. 

 BUILD AND HOST AI-POWERED APPS WITH CLAUDE - NO DEPLOYMENT NEEDED (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Claude app now allows users to build, host, and share interactive
AI-powered apps directly within the platform. These apps are built
using artifacts that interact with Claude through an API. When users
access these shared apps, their usage is charged to their own Claude
subscription, removing scaling costs and API key management for the
developer. 

 PLJS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 PLJS is a lightweight and fast JavaScript language extension for
PostgreSQL 14+ powered by QuickJS. It has integrations, type
conversions, and configurable functions with documentation available.

 OPENAI CHARGES BY THE MINUTE, SO MAKE THE MINUTES SHORTER (10 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 To reduce the cost and time of OpenAI transcriptions, speed up your
audio using ffmpeg before uploading it. Transcribing 2x or 3x sped-up
audio reduces the number of audio tokens charged by OpenAI with barely
any impact on transcription quality. In the example shown in this
article, there was a 33% cost reduction with 3x speed compared to the
original audio duration using the gpt-4o-transcribe model. 

 THE PROBABILITY OF A HASH COLLISION (13 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This post explains the math behind hash collisions, which occur when
a hash function assigns the same value to different inputs. It not
only shows the exact formula to predict a collision, but also has a
few simpler approximations that can be used for large datasets. 

 A SHORT HISTORY OF WEB BOTS AND BOT DETECTION TECHNIQUES (28 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Simple bots are easily identified. Nowadays, there are more
sophisticated bot detection methods like IP reputation checks, TCP/TLS
fingerprinting, and JavaScript analysis. As headless browsers have
evolved and the use of orchestration frameworks has grown, so have
advanced detection techniques like behavioral analysis and latency
checks to detect bots attempting to mimic human behavior.

 WHAT PROBLEMS TO SOLVE - BY RICHARD FEYNMAN (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Richard Feynman advises a former student to find satisfaction and
value in tackling solvable, even humble, problems where they can make
a meaningful contribution, rather than pursuing grand, unattainable
goals. 

 CLAUDE CODE ROUTER (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Claude Code Router is a tool that allows users to route Claude Code
requests to different models, customize requests with plugins, and
integrate with GitHub Actions. 

 BRINGING REACT'S `VIEWTRANSITION` TO VANILLA JS (10 MINUTE READ) [18]


 React's View Transition feature can be reimplemented in vanilla
JavaScript by queuing and batching updates for smooth animations. 

 -2000 LINES OF CODE (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 In 1982, a developer protested his team's management's decision to
measure software progress by lines of code by reporting that his
optimization of an application resulted in -2000 lines of code.
