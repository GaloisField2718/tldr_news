 SHIP DOMAIN FEATURES IN HOURS, NOT WEEKS WITH THE AI-READY NAME.COM
API (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Skip the complex integrations. The name.com API lets you build domain
search, registration, and management directly into your app with clean
API calls that just work.

WHY DEVELOPERS CHOOSE THE NAME.COM API:

	* AI-FIRST DEVELOPMENT: Built for Claude, Cursor, and modern AI tools
with OpenAPI spec + MCP support
	* ENTERPRISE-PROVEN: Powers domain operations for Replit, Vercel,
Netlify, and Bolt
	* ZERO OVERHEAD: 99.9% uptime, 24/7 support, transparent pricing with
no hidden fees

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 A SQL HEURISTIC: ORS ARE EXPENSIVE (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OR clauses in SQL queries can be much slower than AND clauses due to
how query planners use indexes. When using OR, the database might
resort to less efficient strategies like merging separate filtered
results or performing a full table scan. Rewriting queries to use AND
clauses, often by using unions or restructuring the schema, can
improve performance. Common schema issues that lead to needing OR
clauses can be addressed by creating secondary tables or using an
extension table pattern. 

 PARALLEL AND RECURSIVE ROUTE RENDERING (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 RSC routers use a unique approach to route rendering, performing it
in parallel on the server and then recursively stitching the results
together on the client to avoid waterfalls. They render a list of
components in parallel, each potentially with a placeholder, and then
serialize the output into a stream. On the client, a recursive
component called `StackReader` uses the `Placeholder` component to
traverse a stack-like data structure created from the stream,
reassembling the nested component tree. 

 REACT VIEWTRANSITION: SMOOTH ANIMATIONS MADE SIMPLE (8 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 React is introducing a new experimental `ViewTransition` component
that wraps the browser's View Transition API to create smooth,
declarative animations between component states without animation
libraries. The component automatically handles enter/exit animations,
shared element transitions, and list filtering when used within
React's concurrent features like `startTransition` or
`useDeferredValue`. It allows CSS customization for different
animation effects.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FRICTION IS NECESSARY FOR GROWTH (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Overcoming friction is necessary for growth. Readily available AI
could stifle creativity by removing the need to struggle and learn
through mistakes. Excessive comfort reduces personal potential and can
lead to stagnation of your skills. 

 TO AI OR NOT TO AI (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An experiment was conducted over two weeks to build an app with full
AI assistance. While the team found AI helpful in specific areas like
searching, code snippets, and language tasks, they were frustrated
with its limitations in providing context, maintaining code, and
uncovering corner cases. Overall, the code became messy, control was
lost, and the team returned to their traditional workflow.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING CLAUDE SONNET 4.5 (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Anthropic has released Claude Sonnet 4.5, a new frontier model with
huge improvements in coding, computer usage, reasoning, and math. The
model has state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like SWE-bench
Verified and OSWorld (for real-world software coding and computer task
abilities). Along with the model, Anthropic has released Claude Code
2.0 and new features to the Claude apps. 

 BUY IT IN CHATGPT: INSTANT CHECKOUT AND THE AGENTIC COMMERCE PROTOCOL
(5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI has launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT, powered by the
Agentic Commerce Protocol developed with Stripe. This allows users in
the US to directly purchase items from participating merchants like
Etsy and soon Shopify, within the chat interface. The Agentic Commerce
Protocol, an open standard for AI commerce, allows AI agents,
individuals, and businesses to collaborate on transactions while
giving merchants control over payments and customer relationships. 

 GIVE YOUR AI EYES: INTRODUCING CHROME DEVTOOLS MCP (8 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 The Chrome DevTools MCP is a new tool that allows AI coding
assistants to see and interact with a live Chrome browser through the
Model Context Protocol, giving AI "eyes" to observe and debug web
applications in real-time. The tool acts as a bridge between AI agents
(like Cursor, Claude, and Gemini) and Chrome's DevTools capabilities,
letting them navigate pages, inspect DOM elements, analyze
performance, simulate user interactions, and debug issues based on
actual browser feedback rather than coding blindly. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 SUBTLETIES OF SQLITE INDEXES (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This dev improved the performance of SQLite queries for his custom
content feed by understanding how SQLite's query planner uses indexes.
Composite indexes are better than multiple single-column indexes, and
the order of columns in an index matters, following the "Left to
right, no skipping, stops at the first range" rule. Also, the
conditions in WHERE clauses for partial indexes must exactly match the
corresponding query conditions. 

 SANDBOXING AGENTS AT THE KERNEL LEVEL (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI agents can be sandboxed at the kernel level in Linux to prevent
unauthorized file access. Tracing the `open` syscall shows three
points of failure where file access can be denied: permission checks,
mount point redirections, and changing the root directory of the
process. Combining mount namespaces and root changes offers control
over the agent's filesystem view.

QUICK LINKS

 STOP USING .REVERSE().FIND(): MEET FINDLAST() (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 `Array.prototype.findLast()` and `Array.prototype.findLastIndex()`
are cleaner, more performant alternatives to reversing arrays for
searching from the end. 

 TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT: BAD EXAMPLE (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Test-driven development is sometimes a flawed theory supported by
anecdotal evidence and doesn't always work in the real-world. 

 TUNING AIO IN POSTGRESQL 18 (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 When tuning the new Asynchronous I/O (AIO) feature in PostgreSQL 18,
users should generally stick with the default `io_method = worker` and
increase the `io_workers` setting to around 25% of the system's cores.


 ELIMINATING COLD STARTS 2: SHARD AND CONQUER (21 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Cloudflare reduced cold starts for Workers by implementing a
consistent hash ring to shard requests, improving memory efficiency
and warm request rates.
