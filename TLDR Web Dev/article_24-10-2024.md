ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE TRUE NATURE OF USEACTIONSTATE (16 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The useActionState hook in React 19 helps manage return values from
server functions and makes the user experience for asynchronous
operations. This article introduces a simple TODO app built with
useReducer and shows how to refactor it to utilize useActionState for
persistence, adding optimistic UI updates and error handling.
Integrating useActionState with useOptimistic makes the user
experience much better and smoother. 

 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MAKE A MOVE IN LICHESS.ORG? (8 MINUTE READ) [6]


 On the chess platform Lichess, moves are sent as JSON packets through
a WebSocket connection, acknowledged by the server, and then published
to a Redis Pub/Sub channel for processing by the core service, lila.
lila updates the game state and stores it in MongoDB. The updated game
state is then sent back to the client. 

 YOU SHOULD PROBABLY PAY ATTENTION TO TOKENIZERS (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tokenizers break down text into smaller units. Their ability to
handle different types of data, such as emojis, misspelled words, and
dates, can affect the accuracy of RAG models. Poor tokenization can
lead to incorrect embeddings and flawed results from LLMs. Data should
be carefully preprocessed and standardized for better LLM retrieval
reliability.

 A LOVE LETTER TO GOLANG (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Go is a valuable programming language for building web applications
thanks to its streamlined syntax, robust standard library, and
concurrency features. Go frameworks like Templ make full-stack
development much easier. 

 OOP IS NOT THAT BAD, ACTUALLY (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Mainstream statically-typed OOP enables straightforward and
backwards-compatible evolution of types, making them easy to compose.
This post shows a simple example involving a logging library and a
database library to demonstrate how OOP allows for adding new
functionality and dependencies without breaking existing code.

 ASYNC RUST IN THREE PARTS (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Async/await in Rust is a way to achieve concurrency without using

tasks. Async/await, using futures and tasks, is a more scalable and
efficient way to manage concurrency, especially for tasks that involve
I/O operations.
