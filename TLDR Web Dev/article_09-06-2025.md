ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE DECREASED GITLAB REPO BACKUP TIMES FROM 48 HOURS TO 41 MINUTES
(7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 GitLab reduced its GitLab repository backup times from 48 hours to 41
minutes by identifying and fixing a performance bottleneck in a
15-year-old Git function. The issue was from an inefficient O(N²)
algorithm used to handle duplicate references within the `git bundle
create` command. GitLab replaced the nested loops with a map data
structure, leading to a 6x performance improvement. 

 A JAVASCRIPT DEVELOPER'S GUIDE TO GO (30 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This is a guide for JavaScript devs transitioning to Go. It covers
fundamental concepts like compilation, packages, variables, structs,
error handling, and concurrency, comparing them to their JavaScript
equivalents. It also goes over important Go-specific concepts, like
its explicit error handling and its powerful concurrency model using
goroutines. 

 SEARCH PARAMS ARE STATE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article discusses the common issue of treating URL search
parameters as an afterthought in web development, leading to
inconsistent data handling and potential bugs. TanStack Router
integrates search parameter schemas directly into the routing layer.
This allows URL search parameters to be treated as state, making them
easily shareable and resistant to reloads. The approach also allows
for type-safe validation, inference, and coordination of search
parameters across different routes and components.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FIELD NOTES FROM SHIPPING REAL CODE WITH CLAUDE (27 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There are three effective modes of AI collaboration: AI as
First-Drafter, Pair-Programmer, and Validator, highlighting the shift
from writing code to editing and directing AI. To use AI effectively
as a collaborator, it's useful to have infrastructure components like
CLAUDE.md files and anchor comments, along with git workflows, to
manage AI-generated code. 

 WHAT "WORKING" MEANS IN THE ERA OF AI APPS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI startups are achieving faster revenue and quicker funding rounds
than pre-AI startups. Both enterprise and consumer AI companies are
showing impressive growth, with consumer companies now generating
significant revenue compared to pre-AI. 

 SELF-HOST & TECH INDEPENDENCE: THE JOY OF BUILDING YOUR OWN (12
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Devs should own their domain and host their own content to maintain
control and build long-term value. This dev self-hosts various
services like their blog, second brain, and home server. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ODYC.JS (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Odyc.js is a small JavaScript library designed to make video game
creation accessible even without prior programming experience. 

 BEACHPATROL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Beachpatrol is a CLI tool that automates and replaces your everyday
web browser using Playwright scripts. It lets users control a Chromium
or Firefox browser with the command line, integrating browser tasks
into custom workflows and OS scripts.

 WHAT WAS RADIANT AI, ANYWAY? (92 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This a deep dive into Bethesda's Radiant AI system, exploring its
origins, promises, and realities in the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
The article traces the evolution of Radiant AI from Morrowind through
subsequent Bethesda titles like Skyrim and Starfield, detailing how it
was intended to create a dynamic and living world through non-scripted
NPC behavior. While the system never fully achieved its initial
ambition, it laid the groundwork for later AI advancements in Bethesda
games and is still used in current versions of the engine. 

 THE HIDDEN TIME BOMB IN THE TAX CODE THAT'S FUELING MASS TECH LAYOFFS
(11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A change to Section 174 of the US tax code, implemented as part of
the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, disallowed companies from immediately
deducting research and development expenses, requiring them to
amortize them over several years. This shift made R&D more expensive,
impacting cash-strapped tech companies and contributing to mass
layoffs that were often blamed on other factors like over-hiring or
AI. 

 I READ ALL OF CLOUDFLARE'S CLAUDE-GENERATED COMMITS (5 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Cloudflare's open-sourced OAuth 2.1 library, which was primarily
written by Claude, has a commit history with prompts. Some patterns in
the creation of it include prompt-by-example and iterative refinement
with specific feedback. Prompts could be treated as part of the source
code in the future, allowing for easy regeneration of codebases with
improved models.

 AI CODING AGENTS (WEBSITE) [17] 

 A performance comparison of AI coding agents like GitHub Copilot,
OpenAI Codex, Cursor Agents, Devin, and Codegen that shows their
success rates in generating merged pull requests - OpenAI Codex
currently leads at 83.3%. 

 FOCUS AND CONTEXT AND LLMS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 While LLMs can complete complex coding tasks with sufficient context
and algorithmic supervision, the current hype around "agentic coding"
as a hands-off solution is misplaced, as these models require intense
management and context curation from skilled engineers for valuable
results.
