 üòò KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE

shipping. But getting that kind of coverage ‚Äî and staying there ‚Äî

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE THREE BYTE FIX (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Our World in Data, a charity org that shows charts about the world,
received a complaint about slow map charts. After some profiling, a
developer found that the k-means clustering algorithm the site was
using was the reason. The issue was due to a 3-character typo in the
JavaScript port of the algorithm. Fixing the typo resulted in a 20x
speed improvement. 

 PRINTING MUSIC WITH CSS GRID (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article describes a new way to show music notation responsively
on the web using CSS Grid. The system defines musical staves as grids,
allowing notes to be positioned by pitch (on the y-axis) and time (on
the x-axis). This approach is responsive, allows for easy swapping of
clefs and time signatures, and makes sure elements like chords and
lyrics are aligned properly.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 "GOOD ENOUGH" IS GOOD ENOUGH! (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Creating software that is ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù is much better than
trying to create software that is perfect. Software can always be
iterated upon after release. HTTP and HTML are examples of imperfect
technologies that have staying power thanks to their continuous
improvement. 

 THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN TODAY'S WORK CULTURE - DISTRACTIONS (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Distractions, usually from too many meetings, are the biggest problem
in today's work culture. They prevent engineers from entering a
‚Äúflow state‚Äù where they can do deep work and complete their tasks
much faster. Managers can help by clustering meetings together and
improving meeting culture. Engineers should protect their focus time
and keep their phones away while in deep work.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SVELTE 5 RELEASE CANDIDATE (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Svelte 5 is now in the Release Candidate stage, which means the
design of the framework is mostly set. There will probably be no
breaking changes, which means developers can now try it out without
worries about future changes breaking their project. 

 EXTENSION.JS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Extension.js is an easy way to create cross-browser web extensions
without any build configuration. It's plug-and-play and has built-in
support for TypeScript, WebAssembly, React, and modern JavaScript. 

 PYINFRA (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Pyinfra automates infrastructure using Python with features for
ad-hoc command execution, service deployment, configuration
management, and more.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AI LEADERBOARDS ARE NO LONGER USEFUL. IT'S TIME TO SWITCH TO PARETO
CURVES (21 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Current AI leaderboards aren't useful anymore because they don't
account for the cost of running AI agents. Researchers should instead
use Pareto curves to visualize the tradeoff between accuracy and cost.
Surprisingly, simple baseline agents can be just as accurate as the
complex, costly agents that top leaderboards. 

 HOW PERPLEXITY BUILDS PRODUCT (15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The AI-powered search engine Perplexity, which has tens of millions
of users with less than 50 employees, uses AI internally to inform all
aspects of building the company. It has small teams of 2-3 people that
work in parallel to reduce any coordination costs. The company hires
self-driven and very proactive engineers.
