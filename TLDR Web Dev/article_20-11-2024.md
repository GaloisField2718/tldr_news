 ZERO MEETINGS? IT'S POSSIBLE - AND EASIER THAN YOU THINK (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 ‚ÄúI love having a calendar full of meetings‚Äù ‚Äî said no
developer, ever. But is it really possible to deliver a project
without any meetings at all?

The answer is yes. Join Andrew Boyagi from Atlassian as he walks
through the "meeting-less project" that went viral on LinkedIn, and
see how you can do it too.

You'll leave with clear guidance on how to structure and communicate
throughout a zero-meetings project [4], while managing async work with
tools like Jira and Loom. You'll also get hear some interesting
perspectives on introducing flexible ways of working to any team.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REACT ANTI-PATTERN: STOP PASSING SETTERS DOWN THE COMPONENTS TREE (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Passing `useState` setter functions as props to child components is a
React anti-pattern. This creates an abstraction leak, tightly coupling
the child to the parent's internal state management and making the
code fragile and less reusable. The solution is to instead pass a
callback function that encapsulates the state change, allowing the
child to update the parent's state without knowing the specific
implementation details. 

 CONDITIONAL PROPS IN REACT USING TYPE DISCRIMINATION (7 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 TypeScript's type discrimination can be used to manage conditional
props in React components, making sure props are type-safe and
mutually exclusive when required. This article shows practical
examples, like defining components that accept either one prop or
another but not both. 

 OFFSET CONSIDERED HARMFUL OR: THE SURPRISING COMPLEXITY OF PAGINATION
IN SQL (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SQL pagination is complex and using the offset keyword can make it
worse. `offset` can lead to duplicate results and degrade performance,
especially with large datasets, due to its need to process and skip
data. A better alternative is to use predicate-based pagination with a
`where` condition.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ONCALL SHIFT SHOULD BE TUESDAY TO TUESDAY (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A Tuesday-to-Tuesday on-call rotation is better than Monday-to-Monday
because it accommodates weekend issue resolution and holiday
scheduling, allowing for a more thorough follow-up on problems. It's a
simple, low-cost improvement to overall team efficiency. 

 HOW I SHIP PROJECTS AT BIG TECH COMPANIES (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Engineers should prioritize impact over optics and focus on
delivering meaningful results that improve metrics and benefit users.
Trust and recognition are gained through impactful work and should not
be the primary goal.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW TO SECURE LIVEBLOCKS ROOMS IN NEXT.JS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Learn how to secure real-time collaborative apps by integrating
Liveblocks with Clerk in a Next.js setup. This guide addresses
unauthorized access risks by ensuring only authenticated users can
access Liveblocks rooms, enhancing security in apps like team-based
task managers. Perfect for developers prioritizing data protection in
collaborative environments. 

 REACT SCAN (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 React Scan is a tool that automatically detects and highlights
performance issues in React applications. Unlike other tools, it
requires minimal code changes and provides clear visual cues to
pinpoint problematic components. 

 PGLITE-FUSION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Pglite-fusion lets users embed SQLite databases into their PostgreSQL
tables.

MISCELLANEOUS

 UNDERSTANDING THE BM25 FULL TEXT SEARCH ALGORITHM (14 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 The BM25 algorithm is a full-text search algorithm widely used in
systems like Lucene/Elasticsearch and SQLite. This post goes over the
algorithm's mathematical components - inverse document frequency
(IDF), term frequency, and document length normalization - showing how
they contribute to a relevance score. 

 AWS LAMBDA TURNS TEN ‚Äì LOOKING BACK AND LOOKING AHEAD (7 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 AWS Lambda launched in 2014 and quickly gained traction. Today, it

invocations monthly. 

 GO TURNS 15 (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Go recently celebrated its 15th anniversary as an open-source
project. Its user base has more than tripled in the last five years.
Recent Go releases (1.22 and 1.23) were focused on improving for
loops, iterators, and generics, along with improvements to the
standard library, including the HTTP router and execution traces.

 PLEASE JUST STOP SAYING "JUST" (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The word "just," when used to describe a software engineering
solution, minimizes the complexity of the task, discourages critical
thinking and alternative solutions, and contributes to imposter
syndrome.
