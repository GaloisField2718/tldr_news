ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW GRAB CATEGORIZES TENS OF MILLIONS OF USERS IN MILLISECONDS (9
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Grab operates a Segmentation Platform to categorize users, drivers,
and restaurants into segments for various purposes, such as
experimentation, blacklisting, and marketing. This platform handles
substantial workloads, with impressive performance metrics of up to
12,000 reads per second, 36,000 writes per second, and a low P99
latency of 40 milliseconds. It consists of two key subsystems: Segment
Creation, powered by Apache Spark, and Segment Serving, supported by
Go services and ScyllaDB for efficient data storage and retrieval. 

 TAO OF REACT - SOFTWARE DESIGN, ARCHITECTURE & BEST PRACTICES (20
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article dives into best practices for React application
structure and design, with general rules for building a productive
codebase. It covers various aspects, including components, state
management, application structure, performance, testing, styling, and
data fetching. The article advocates favoring functional components,
maintaining consistency in component styles, and using meaningful
component names. It also suggests organizing helper functions outside
the component definition, avoiding hard-coded repetitive markup, and
managing component size effectively. 

 THE SYSTEM DESIGN CHEAT SHEET: API STYLES (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A well-designed API can enhance performance, while a poorly designed
API can cause a multitude of issues, such as bottlenecks and security
vulnerabilities. Different API styles include REST, GraphQL,
WebSocket, Webhook, RPC (gRPC), and SOAP. This article breaks down
different API styles and explores the key features and drawbacks of
each API type. For example, GraphQL offers flexibility by allowing
clients to specify their data requirements and is suitable for
scenarios with complex frontend needs.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 7 TYPES OF DIFFICULT COWORKERS AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM (13 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 This article explains the 7 types of difficult coworkers you may
encounter, why they‚Äôre difficult, and how to turn situations with
them into wins for both of you. The author is a tech lead at Meta and
has over 10 years of industry experience. An example is the
risk-averse coworker: they want to avoid risks and tend to push back
on new initiatives because they want to make sure you have done your
research. The key to working with them is recognizing what they‚Äôre
doing is good for you - they are a forcing function for ensuring your
plans are well thought out. 

 WHEN TO START WRITING TESTS (REDDIT POST) [9] 

 An engineering team built a product that grew fast without writing
any tests. However, the product is now starting to have flakiness and
bugs from its lack of tests, so a Reddit user asked when the right
time to start writing tests is. Commenters respond with advice, such
as writing unit tests to make sure functionality doesn‚Äôt change over
time. They advise selling the idea of taking time to write tests to
management by using a perspective of risk.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 OPENSIGN (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 OpenSign is an open-source document e-signing solution. It ensures
document security through advanced cryptographic algorithms, features
a user-friendly interface for all users, and supports various browsers
and devices. OpenSign also allows collaboration among team members,
maintains detailed audit trails, generates completion certificates,
and offers API support for integration with other software and
services. 

 SCRATCHDB (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 ScratchDB is a Clickhouse wrapper that enables users to input
arbitrary JSON data and conduct analytical queries effortlessly. It
automatically generates tables and columns as new data is introduced.

 THE THREE CS: ü§ù CONCATENATE, üóúÔ∏è COMPRESS, üó≥Ô∏è CACHE (12
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There are a number of different things we need to take into
consideration in order to balance ergonomics, performance, and
effectiveness when serving and storing files on the web. This post
breaks these processes down into three parts: concatenating files on
the server, compressing them over the network, and caching static
assets. 

 WHEN TO USE CSS TEXT-WRAP:BALANCE VS TEXT-WRAP:PRETTY (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Two new values for the text-wrap property were recently introduced:
balance and pretty. This article explores when and why you should use
them, with code samples to help you visualize their effects.

 TOP 5 GITHUB REPOSITORIES TO ACHIEVE SYSTEM DESIGN MASTERY (2 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 A list of GitHub repositories containing system design tutorials,
blogs, videos, and case studies. 

 WHEN A/B TESTING DOESN'T WORK (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A/B tests are used to gauge the impact of simultaneous changes on
different segments of a user base. While A/B tests can be highly
beneficial for tech giants like Google or Meta, they often pose more
challenges than advantages for other companies. Reasons for this
include insufficient data, the tendency for incremental changes, the
added workload of building and maintaining both features, and
difficulty in determining what exactly to measure. Startups, in
particular, benefit from being opinionated due to resource constraints
and the inability to conduct extensive tests.
