ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW I SOLVED A DISTRIBUTED QUEUE PROBLEM AFTER 15 YEARS (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Jeremy Edberg, formerly responsible for Reddit's infrastructure,
discusses the challenges and limitations of traditional task queues
using RabbitMQ for operations like Reddit's vote processing. While
they do have scalability and flow control benefits, they are also
fragile and have the potential for data loss due to queue failures. A
better solution is durable queues that checkpoint task status to a
persistent store like Postgres, as this can enable the resumption of
failed jobs and prevent data loss. 

 COLOR SHIFTING IN CSS (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post goes over CSS color animation techniques, specifically
addressing the challenge of creating smooth color shifts. It
highlights the limitations of using RGB for color transitions, which
can result in washed-out, greyish intermediate colors due to how
browsers calculate these transitions. CSS filters like `hue-rotate()`
are a more performant solution that avoids these issues, offering a
more vibrant color shift.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WRITING CODE IS EASY. READING IT ISN'T (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While writing code can be relatively simple, the real challenge is in
reading and understanding existing codebases. Building a mental model
of a system, which involves understanding its components,
dependencies, and potential side effects, is a time-consuming and
effort-intensive process. This is necessary for debugging though. 

 FORMATTING CODE SHOULD BE UNNECESSARY (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 We should revisit the approach of systems like the Rational R1000,
which used an intermediate representation (DIANA) instead of plain
text source code to remove formatting debates and improve development
efficiency. 

 'MAKE INVALID STATES UNREPRESENTABLE' CONSIDERED HARMFUL (12 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The principle of making invalid states unrepresentable in software
design is not a good one. State machines, foreign key constraints, and
Protocol Buffers are all examples where strict enforcement can lead to
complications when dealing with edge cases or schema changes. While
constraints are important for reasoning about systems, software should
allow for some invalid states to accommodate real-world complexities
and avoid rigid, difficult-to-change designs.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DEVCYCLE'S MCP SERVER BRINGS FEATURE FLAGGING TO AI AGENTS (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 With DevCycle's MCP server, your AI agent can create, manage and
evaluate feature flags [11] - and you can stay in code and in context.
Use it to create / QA features end-to-end with a prompt, or to
investigate incidents right from your AI-enabled IDE. Want to get
started fast? Use AI to install DevCycle for you [11]. 

 JAAZ (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Jaaz is an open-source, privacy-focused alternative to Canva and
Manus, functioning as a multimodal creative assistant that can be used
locally. It lets users generate images and videos from prompts, create
visuals with "Magic Canvas" and "Magic Video" features, and use an
infinite canvas for storyboarding. 

 QUARTZ (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Quartz is a free set of tools for publishing digital gardens and
notes as websites. It's a static-site generator with features like
Obsidian integration and networked thought capabilities. 

 HEROUI (WEBSITE) [14] 

 HeroUI is a React UI library built on Tailwind CSS for creating
accessible and customizable web apps. It has themeability with custom
TailwindCSS plugins, automatic dark mode, and pre-made components with
210+ templates. HeroUI's components are designed for accessibility,
follow WAI-ARIA guidelines, and can be used directly in React server
components.

 WHAT IF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS JUST A “NORMAL” TECHNOLOGY? (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Artificial intelligence should be viewed as a "normal technology.”
This view, presented by Princeton computer scientists, suggests AI's
development could follow the trajectory of previous technological
revolutions. This means a slower adoption rate, a gradual impact on
jobs with increased human oversight, and a focus on downstream
defenses against misuse, rather than alignment. 

 USING CLAUDE CODE TO MODERNIZE A 25-YEAR-OLD KERNEL DRIVER (10 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 This dev modernized the ftape Linux kernel driver, which hadn't been
updated in 25 years and was necessary for recovering data from old
QIC-80 tapes. He used Claude Code to update the driver to be
compatible with modern Linux kernels, addressing deprecated functions
and build issues. Despite requiring some manual adjustments and prior
kernel module knowledge, Claude Code made the process really fast
comparatively.

QUICK LINKS

 LOOK OUT FOR BUGS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Proactively find bugs by carefully and slowly reading code to build a
mental model of the program and identify discrepancies, rather than
relying solely on iterative testing. 

 NINTENDO SECURES $2 MILLION SETTLEMENT AGAINST SWITCH MODDER —
MODDED HARDWARE CREATOR AGREED TO STOP SELLING BACKUP DEVICES, BUT
CONTINUED TO, PROMPTING LAWSUIT (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Nintendo won a $2 million settlement and a broad injunction against a
modder who sold devices that circumvented Switch security, banning him
from selling or possessing such devices, reverse engineering Nintendo
systems, or linking to related materials. 

 MAC ANGLE (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Mac-Angle is a C++ library for reading the lid angle sensor data from
supported MacBooks that provides real-time angle measurements with
exception handling and a CMake build system. 

 PACKAGE MANAGERS ARE EVIL (10 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Package managers, while automating dependency handling, ultimately
contribute to "dependency hell" and are a net-negative for programming
due to their unnecessary automation, poorly defined package concepts,
and encouragement of unvetted dependencies.
