 REARCHITECTING CORE SERVICES AT X (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 X's Core Services team rearchitected the read path for Posts by
splitting the read and write path of Tweetypie, a core service, into
two separate services. They did this because of the service's resource
intensity, unbalanced read and write traffic, and code complexity
issues caused by its monolithic nature. The new architecture uses X's
distributed ecosystem and has resulted in a highly performant Tweet
Entity Service capable of handling millions of operations per second. 

 THE STATE OF ES5 ON THE WEB (16 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A Google engineer examines the current state of ES5 on the web,
challenging the traditional practice of transpiling to ES5. Data shows
that many popular websites unnecessarily bundle ES5 helpers with ES6+
code, leading to unnecessary bloat. Instead, it's better for
developers to shift towards "Baseline Widely Available" features,
which benefits both library authors, who can focus on publishing
modern code, and website developers, who can tailor browser support to
their specific needs through their build tools. 

 MODERN DATA-FETCHING IN REACT (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Data-fetching in React has shifted from client-side fetching in
traditional SPAs to server-side fetching using frameworks like NextJS
and Remix. The React team advocates for server-side data-fetching due
to its efficiency and the complexity of client-side approaches. This
post goes over using React Router loaders, Tanstack Query, and React
Server Components for handling data in React.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MENTORSHIP: UNDERRATED PERK OF BIG TECH (REDDIT THREAD) [8] 

 Working at a Big Tech company offers rare mentorship opportunities
that are often overlooked. This developer shares how they learned a
lot from experienced colleagues at their Big Tech company, like the
engineer who revamped Facebook's newsfeed. Mentorship isn't always a
structured program, but rather about proactively reaching out to
people for advice and guidance. 

 WHY SCRUM IS STRESSING YOU OUT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Sprints in Scrum can lead to chronic stress due to their constant
nature, lack of autonomy, and insufficient time for preparation.
Traditional Waterfall methods have waves of high-pressure periods
balanced with more reasonable periods. The ongoing, medium-level
stress of sprints, in contrast, can be more damaging. 

 HOW TO LEAD YOUR TEAM WHEN THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE (12 MINUTE READ) [10]


 When a company is going through challenging times (‚Äúwartime‚Äù),
engineering managers should focus on goal-aligned delivery, proper
building and leading of the team, and supporting individual success.
This post provides specific strategies and tactics for each area.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 YOU DON'T NEED A DOZEN MONITORING TOOLS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Teams today use an average of 12+ monitoring tools to collect and
analyze trillions of data points (including cloud and on-premises
resources). Tool sprawl of this scale can take a severe toll on your
ability to mitigate outages and risks. Learn how to consolidate
monitoring tools [11], maximize uptime, and ship faster. Read the
Datadog solution brief [11] 

 REACT-CALL (WEBSITE) [12] 

 react-call provides a simple and flexible way to imperatively call
React components from anywhere in an application, even outside of
React. This makes it ideal for scenarios like confirmations,
notifications, popups, and more. It also lets devs present UI, wait
for user interaction, and receive response data. 

 ADZE (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Adze is a universal logging library for TypeScript and JavaScript
that can run in any JS runtime without configuration. It supports both
server and browser environments. Adze has first-class TypeScript
support, a chainable API, log listeners, middleware support, log
annotations, and various log formats. 

 JAQT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 jaqt is a JavaScript library that uses native array functions to
provide a query engine inspired by GraphQL and SQL. It lets devs
perform complex data transformations while still writing JavaScript
(instead of SQL).
