ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 KEYSET CURSORS, NOT OFFSETS, FOR POSTGRES PAGINATION (8 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Offset pagination in Postgres can decrease performance and
correctness as the offset increases. Keyset pagination, using a
compound cursor based on multiple columns, has much better performance
and handles deletions gracefully, maintaining a stable order even with
data modifications. However, keyset pagination still has subtle
correctness issues related to concurrent inserts causing rows to be
skipped, but there are strategies to get around this. 

 7 DATABASES IN 7 WEEKS FOR 2025 (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article lists seven diverse databases to explore in 2025, with
each warranting a week of dedicated study. The list includes both
embedded databases like SQLite and DuckDB (focused on local and
analytical processing respectively) and distributed systems like
CockroachDB and FoundationDB. Each entry includes suggested projects
for a better understanding of the database and its capabilities.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HAUNTED BY MY OWN PROJECTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This developer is struggling to finish their numerous side projects,
often abandoning them before completion in pursuit of new ideas.
Currently, despite having time and motivation, they're paralyzed by
the perceived effort required to revive their unfinished projects,
even though they genuinely want them to be completed. The allure of
starting something new overshadows the almost-finished projects, even
though finishing them would be relatively easier. 

 WHY DO OPEN SOURCE APPLICATIONS OFTEN HAVE LESS POLISHED UIS THAN
COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Open-source software often prioritizes functionality over aesthetics
due to limited resources and volunteer-driven development. Commercial
software companies, in contrast, dedicate large budgets to UI/UX
designers and maintain consistent design languages through centralized
teams.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GET YOUR TEAM ON LOOM TO GET MEETINGS OFF YOUR CALENDAR (SPONSOR) [8]


 You probably know Loom as a screen recorder - but it can be much
more. With powerful recording features and AI-powered workflows [9],
you can turn it into a productivity powerhouse and turn those 30
minute status meetings into 3 minute video messages. Join a demo and
see what teams can do with Loom [8] 

 REACT 19 (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 React 19 introduces numerous new features, including hooks for
managing asynchronous actions and optimistic updates
(`useActionState`, `useOptimistic`), a new resource reading API
(`use`), and improved form handling. Large changes include a
refactoring of how refs are used and new support for enhanced document
metadata, stylesheets, and scripts. 

 INTRODUCING CHATGPT PRO (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI's ChatGPT Pro is a $200 monthly subscription that offers
unlimited access to the company's most powerful AI models. It includes
a "pro mode" with better accuracy and reliability for complex tasks. 

 CHECKMATE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Checkmate is an open-source, self-hosted server and website
monitoring application that tracks uptime, performance, and incidents.
It has real-time alerts and reports and optionally utilizes an agent
for detailed server resource monitoring.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TEACHING ELDERLY PEOPLE TO USE ANDROID - LESSONS LEARNED (8 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 This developer created a comprehensive video course teaching elderly
people how to use Android smartphones. The project involved extensive
work, including scriptwriting, video production, app development, and
marketing, and took approximately a year to complete. However,
reaching the target audience proved challenging due to their limited
online proficiency and the course not appearing in relevant search
results. 

 DATAVIZ ACCESSIBILITY PRINCIPLES, DEMONSTRATED BY THE 2024
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DASHBOARDS (29 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Several 2024 US presidential election dashboards had accessibility
issues, including problems with zooming, keyboard navigation, screen
reader compatibility, and sufficient alternative text for images.
Automated testing revealed numerous WCAG 2.1 violations, ranging from
3 to 62 errors per dashboard, with Fox News having the most problems. 

 LOSSLESS LOG AGGREGATION (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Log storage in observability has a high cost and the common practice
of reducing log volume by discarding data. Lossless Log Aggregation
(LLA) is a possible solution, which is a technique that aggregates
similar logs to drastically reduce storage needs without losing any
data. LLA works by deduplicating common metadata and merging similar
logs.
