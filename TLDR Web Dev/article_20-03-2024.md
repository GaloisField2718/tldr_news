ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE ARCHITECTURE OF DOORDASH'S SEARCH ENGINE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Elasticsearch was not scaling well for DoorDash‚Äôs search engine and
lacked customization for the company‚Äôs needs in modeling complex
data and search ranking, so DoorDash built its own search engine using
Apache Lucene, a core search library, and designed its own indexer and
searcher to meet its specific requirements. The indexer processes
documents into easily searchable formats, while the searcher
replicates index data and uses Lucene's search functionality to match
queries and rank results. 

 UNDERSTANDING GOOGLE‚ÄôS FILE SYSTEM (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 When Google revealed its File System (GFS), it was a breakthrough in
distributed storage. Designed for storing massive files across
commodity hardware, GFS stored files in 64MB chunks replicated across
machines for redundancy and performance. A central "master" managed
metadata (file names, chunk locations, and versions) and coordinated
reads/writes. To append data to files, the client would get write
permission from the master, send data to multiple chunk servers, and
have the designated "primary" server coordinate final writes. 

 A BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO NODE.JS WORKER THREADS (19 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Worker threads provide a way to create independent JavaScript
execution threads that run in parallel. This post walks through an
example of offloading CPU-intensive tasks to a worker thread in
Node.js. Without offloading, tasks can block the event loop and
prevent the server from processing other requests. The article shows
an example of the server going from processing 7.3k requests to 0
tasks due to a CPU-intensive task.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO START GOOGLE (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Paul Graham, the founder of Y Combinator, gives advice to people who
want to create the next Google. They should be makers and work on
their own passion projects to learn fast. The best ideas come from
projects you build for yourself and your friends to use. Something you
truly need is a great sign. Great co-founders come from working
together on things. 

 IS THE ‚ÄúAI DEVELOPER‚Äù A THREAT TO JOBS ‚Äì OR A MARKETING STUNT?
(8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI tools like Devin claim to replace software engineers. These
startups face an uphill battle against established AI coding
assistants like GitHub Copilot, so their claims need to be bold to get
attention. For decades, there have been attempts to automate away the
need for programmers, yet software engineers remain high in demand.
The future likely lies in improved versions of existing AI coding
assistants, not standalone "AI developers." 

 BUILD SYSTEM SCHISM: THE CURSE OF META BUILD SYSTEMS (11 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Meta‚Äôs build systems follow a two-step process. The first step
generates instructions for what to build and the second step executes
the build. This separation makes them inflexible, as you can't add new
files without re-running the first step. "End-to-end" (E2E) systems
combine both steps, allowing for dynamic target discovery. In these
systems, cloud caching, early cutoff, suspending schedulers, and
minimal builds are all features easier to implement correctly.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FIND VULNERABILITIES FASTER¬†(SPONSOR) [18] 

 Web applications have critical vulnerabilities that only dynamic
analysis can find. Rapidly find and fix runtime vulnerabilities with
Veracode [18]:
‚úÖ Scan hundreds of web apps and APIs simultaneously

‚úÖ <5% false positive rate

 ETA (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Eta is a lightweight and fast embedded JavaScript templating engine
that works inside Node, Deno, and the browser. It is written in
TypeScript and emphasizes great performance, configurability, and
small bundle size. 

 CAPO.JS (GITHUB REPO) [20] 

 How you order elements in the `head` tag can have an effect on the
perceived performance of the page. Capo.js helps identify which
elements are out of order in your `head` tag on a web page. 

 GARNET (GITHUB REPO) [21] 

 Garnet is a remote cache store developed by Microsoft Research. It is
compatible with standard Redis clients and features a wide range of
APIs, custom server-side operations, a robust storage layer, security,
and more.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY DOES AN EXTRANEOUS BUILD STEP MAKE MY ZIG APP 10X FASTER? (11
MINUTE READ) [22] 

 This author built a Zig implementation of an Ethereum virtual machine
with the aim of making it faster than the official Go version. A
seemingly unrelated change to a benchmarking script made the Zig app
slower. This was because commands in bash pipelines run in parallel,
so a Zig app, when freshly compiled, has to wait for input from
preceding commands. The author limited memory usage at compile time
and used buffered reads to make his implementation faster than the
official Go version. 

 INSIDE THE MASSIVE ALLEGED AT&T DATA BREACH (6 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 An alleged AT&T data breach leaked data on 70 million customers,
including sensitive information like SSNs. AT&T maintains the data did
not originate from its systems, leaving the source of the breach
unclear. The accuracy of the leaked data, which has now been dumped
publicly, has been verified. 

 PARSING THE HN WHO IS HIRING THREAD WITH CHATGPT AND NODE.JS (7
MINUTE READ) [24] 

 This author built a tech job board based on Hacker News threads using
Node.js and the ChatGPT API. They found that ChatGPT was good at
converting unstructured job post text into structured JSON data. The
input size for the OpenAI API calls was optimized to stay within token
limits and concurrent requests were made to speed up the entire
process. They then used Node.js, TypeScript, and SQLite to track and
store data. Most work in building AI apps is in building the
infrastructure around it and handling error cases.

QUICK LINKS

 WHO COMMITS CODE AND AT WHAT FREQUENCY? (1 MINUTE READ) [25] 

 The median active developer merges 2 PRs per week. 48% of active
developers are responsible for 80% of PRs merged since 2023. 

 JNV (GITHUB REPO) [26] 

 jnv is designed for navigating JSON, offering an interactive JSON
viewer and jq filter editor. 

 C++ CREATOR REBUTS WHITE HOUSE WARNING (2 MINUTE READ) [27] 

 Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, disagrees with the White
House's recommendation to avoid C++ due to memory safety concerns, as
the language has improved its safety over time. 

 JAVA 22 / JDK 22: GENERAL AVAILABILITY (2 MINUTE READ) [28] 

 Java 22 has been officially released.
