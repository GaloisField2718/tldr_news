 WHY AIRBNB MOVED AWAY FROM A MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE (6 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Airbnb's migration from a monolithic Ruby on Rails architecture to a
service-oriented architecture (SOA) in 2018 was driven by the need for
improved maintainability and reduced single points of failure. The
company outlined four key lessons learned during this transition:
invest in shared infrastructure early, simplify service dependencies,
centralize data hydration, and separate UI logic from backend logic.
This article discusses the transition and compares Airbnb's
architectural choices with those of other tech giants like Meta,
Google, and Uber. 

 HOW POSTGRES STORES DATA ON DISK (35 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Postgres stores data on disk by using a system of files and folders
for each database. This post explains the structure of these folders,
including the 'base' directory which contains subdirectories for each
database, and the various files within, such as 'pg_hba.conf' for
authentication. The post then focuses on the 'heap,' where actual
table data is stored, and the 'pages' that make up the heap, each
containing fixed-size blocks of data. 

 BOOSTING PERFORMANCE: FAIRE'S TRANSITION TO NEXTJS (13 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Faire's migration to the NextJS framework improved its web
application's load performance by leveraging server-side rendering and
other modern techniques. This transition reduced its page load times
and abandonment rates, while improving metrics like Largest Contentful
Paint. The migration also included custom solutions for localization
and maintaining compatibility with existing systems, setting the stage
for future performance optimizations.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO UNDERSTAND/RETAIN COMPLEX CONCEPTS 10X BETTER (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This article presents a learning technique for understanding and
retaining complex concepts: iterative compression through repeated
explanation. The idea is to repeatedly explain a concept, with the
goal of simplifying it and making it easier to understand. This
process involves refining your explanation, focusing on clarity and
using first principles, eventually reaching a point where you can
explain it from scratch. By doing so, you create a deeper
understanding of the concept and make it easier to work with. 

 SHOULD THE DAILY STAND-UP DIE? (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The daily stand-up meeting has become a tedious and time-consuming
ritual in many organizations. However, many agile coaches and leaders
argue that the stand-up itself isn't the problem, but rather the way
it is implemented. They advocate for a shift in focus from status
reporting to collaboration and communication instead, making changes
for the team's specific needs.

 THERE ARE BETTER THINGS TO CODE THAN FORMS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Stop coding forms! Use the SurveyJS [10] drag-and-drop form builder
to generate and style dynamic, JSON-driven forms [10] of any
complexity, right in your JavaScript application (Angular / React /
Vue.js / jQuery). SurveyJS comes with a friendly UI, form branching,
CSS theme editor, and integrations with your backend systems. Try a
fully-featured demo [11]

 GOOGLE MONOPOLIZED SEARCH THROUGH ILLEGAL DEALS, JUDGE RULES (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A US judge ruled that Google illegally monopolized the search market
by paying billions to make its search engine the default on
smartphones and web browsers, effectively blocking competitors. This
decision is the US government's first major antitrust case win against
a US tech giant in over two decades. Judge Amit Mehta found that
Google's exclusive deals with companies like Apple and Samsung
foreclosed competition and enabled the company to raise advertising
prices without consequence. 

 KALMOGOROV-ARNOLD NEURAL NETWORKS SHAKE UP HOW AI IS DONE (4 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Researchers have developed a new type of neural network called
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which offer greater
interpretability and accuracy compared to traditional neural networks.
KANs learn complex functions at each connection, allowing them to
represent data more efficiently and with fewer parameters. This new
architecture has shown promising results in scientific tasks like
solving partial differential equations and predicting topological knot
attributes, outperforming traditional networks with significantly
fewer parameters.
