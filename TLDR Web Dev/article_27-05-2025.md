ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 6 WAYS SLACK, NOTION, AND VSCODE IMPROVED ELECTRON APP PERFORMANCE
(10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Electron apps often face performance challenges like slow startup
times and poor interaction, but these can be improved with strategic
optimizations. The most impactful strategies include using a bundler
to avoid synchronous `require()` calls, deferring non-critical imports
with code splitting, and migrating computationally expensive tasks to
WebAssembly or native modules. More improvements come from using V8
snapshots for faster initialization and by actively monitoring
end-user performance with tools. 

 PARTICLE LIFE SIMULATION IN BROWSER USING WEBGPU (23 MINUTE READ) [5]


 This article goes over a Particle Life simulation implemented in the
browser using WebGPU. WebGPU was used for its modern API, compute
shader support, and browser compatibility. The simulation loop
involves computing forces using spatial hashing, advancing particles,
applying boundary conditions, and rendering, with performance
optimization through parallel prefix sum for binning and GPU-based
force calculations. 

 WHICH GO ROUTER SHOULD I USE? (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article evaluates 30 third-party routers and recommends five:
http.ServeMux, httprouter, chi, flow, and gorilla/mux. http.ServeMux
is good due to its standard library status, while alternatives like
gorilla/mux or chi are better for complex matching requirement.
httprouter and flow are good for custom 404/405 responses.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED A DI FRAMEWORK (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Manual dependency wiring is better than using Dependency Injection
(DI) frameworks in Go. DI, at its core, is simply passing dependencies
into constructors rather than creating them internally. As a result,
DI frameworks can introduce complexity by relying on reflection or
code generation, leading to runtime errors or difficult debugging. 

 THE COPILOT DELUSION (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot promote an illusion of
progress and degrade programming skills. While they are occasionally
helpful for syntax and brainstorming, they lead to lazy coding,
technical debt, and a disconnection from the underlying hardware. 

 ASK HN: ANYONE STRUGGLING TO GET VALUE OUT OF CODING LLMS? (HACKER
NEWS THREAD) [9] 

 LLMs aren't always great for core coding tasks, as the generated code
often requires excessive micromanagement and isn't maintainable. Some
find LLMs highly productive for greenfield projects, but less helpful
for maintaining existing systems or handling complex features. Others
find that LLMs raise the floor of software dev skills.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW TO ADD AN IN-APP NOTIFICATION FEED TO A NEXT.JS APP (SPONSOR)
[10] 

 Learn how to handle real-time updates, manage read/unread states,
implement pagination, and create an intuitive UI. You'll be using
Knock's pre-built components [11] while maintaining the flexibility to
customize the experience for users. Read the blog [10] 

 PGDOG (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 PgDog is a Rust-based transaction pooler and logical replication
manager designed to shard PostgreSQL databases. It acts as a load
balancer, supporting healthchecks, failover, and various connection
routing strategies, including directing SELECT queries to replicas. 

 ANTHROPIC RUBY SDK (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Anthropic Ruby SDK provides easy access to the Anthropic REST API
from Ruby apps, with features like streaming responses, pagination,
file uploads, error handling, retries, timeouts, AWS Bedrock and
Google Vertex integration, and Sorbet typing. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE IS BURYING THE WEB ALIVE (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's new AI Overviews and AI Mode are changing how users interact
with search results. Instead of directing users to external websites,
these features summarize information directly within Google's
interface, effectively demoting and burying the original sources. This
shift risks undermining the websites that supply Google with data,
starving them of traffic and revenue. 

 THE DOUBLE STANDARD OF WEBHOOK SECURITY AND API SECURITY (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 There's a common practice of signing webhook requests with
HMAC-SHA256 while API requests often rely on just API keys. Request
signing has benefits like reduced secret leakage, replay protection,
and integrity verification, but it also introduces complexity and
performance overhead. Herd mentality and historical precedent
contribute to this double standard, but in today's world, it's fine
for webhooks to also just use shared secrets like API requests.

QUICK LINKS

 HOW TO RUN LLMS ON-DEVICE IN REACT NATIVE WITH VERCEL AI SDK (10
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 `react-native-ai` is a React Native library powered by the MLC LLM
Engine and compatible with Vercel AI SDK, letting devs run LLMs
on-device within React Native apps. 

 MAKING NEXT.JS NAVIGATION FAST AF (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Faster Next.js page navigation is possible by using React Router and
a static app shell for client-side routing instead of Next.js's
default navigation. 

 I THINK IT'S TIME TO GIVE NIX A CHANCE (16 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Despite its steep learning curve, Nix, a functional package manager,
is worth considering because it solves the growing problem of
irreproducible software development environments through its approach
of isolated, cryptographically-assured package management, and
reproducible environments with flakes. 

 AI MAKES BAD MANAGERS (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Relying on AI to perform core management tasks, like performance
reviews, prevents managers from developing the core skills needed to
become good managers, such as the difficult decision-making required
for effective leadership.
