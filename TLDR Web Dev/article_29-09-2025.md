 CONTROLLING SHADOW AI: THE ROAD TO SECURITY HELL IS PAVED WITH GOOD
INTENTIONS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your most ambitious employees might be your biggest security risk.
They're early adopters of AI to drive productivity - but many of them
(up to 46% in some surveys) are also sending sensitive data or
proprietary IP to public AI tools.

If you don't want customer credit cards showing up on the dark web,
it's time to get a handle on shadow AI. This guide from you.com [4]
covers:

>> Concrete ways to detect shadow AI in your organization

>> Using the AI Tool Risk Heatmap [4] to assess different AI tools

>> A checklist to vet the security risk of new AI vendors

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING A NEXT-GENERATION KEY-VALUE STORE AT AIRBNB (8 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Airbnb completely re-architected its key-value store, Mussel,
replacing the original version with a new NewSQL backend (v2) to meet
demands like real-time checks and massive data. Mussel v2 addresses
v1's limitations with better scalability, predictable performance,
reduced operational complexity, and more flexible consistency options.
The migration process involved a blue/green deployment strategy with
shadowing, reverse traffic patterns, and a custom pipeline to
guarantee zero data loss. 

 BUILDING A RESILIENT DATA PLATFORM WITH WRITE-AHEAD LOG AT NETFLIX
(13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Netflix built a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) system for data consistency,
reliability, and efficient operations across its massive
infrastructure. The WAL system has a simple API, allowing it to
function as a delayed queue, enabling generic cross-region replication
for services like EVCache and handling multi-partition mutations in
Key-Value stores. By writing to the WAL first, applications gain
eventual consistency, systematic replication, and automatic retries.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 QUESTIONS TO ASK WHEN YOU THINK NEED TO FINISH SOMETHING (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 When trying to figure out if you want to finish or stop working on a
side project, you should do a mental audit to figure out if it's worth
continuing. Ask yourself if it still aligns with your current goals
and whether there are better options to work on than this one. 

 WHEN I SAY "ALPHABETICAL ORDER", I MEAN "ALPHABETICAL ORDER" (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The author and his dad took photos on a hike, and the author expected
them to sort correctly by date when alphabetically ordered. However,
he found that graphical file managers (Windows, Google Drive, KDE
Dolphin, Gnome) sorted the files incorrectly, with his photos
consistently appearing before his dad's. The problem was that his
phone included an underscore to separate milliseconds, but his dad's
didn't, causing the file managers to treat the milliseconds part of
the filename as a large numerical value and mis-sort the files. 

 THE AI CODING TRAP (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The "code first, ask questions later" approach when using AI coding
agents too much leads to increased time spent on debugging and
integrating AI-generated code, reducing overall productivity. Instead,
treat AI agents like fast but inexperienced junior engineers.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ANOTHER "QUICK SYNC" AT 4 PM? THERE'S A BETTER WAY (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Your team nailed Jira workflows and Confluence docs, but somehow
you're still drowning in status meetings. Reclaim your time with
Loom's async video approach [10] — record bug reproductions, design
reviews, and project updates. Share them where it makes sense, or
generate PRDs and documentation from recordings with Loom AI. See how
engineering teams use Loom [10] 

 ZUSTAND SYNC (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Zustand Sync is a middleware that synchronizes Zustand stores across
multiple clients using JSON Patch. It translates state changes into
patches that are sent through a transport layer for real-time state
sharing. 

 TYPST: A POSSIBLE LATEX REPLACEMENT (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Typst is a new document typesetting program designed to replace LaTeX
with a simpler markup system and faster compilation. Typst's
advantages include an easier markup syntax, more user-friendly error
messages, and better handling of floating figures and tables. 

 SSH3 (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 SSH3 is a reimplementation of SSH that uses HTTP/3 mechanisms for
better session establishment, security, and features. It uses
QUIC+TLS1.3 for secure channels and HTTP Authorization for
authentication, supporting methods like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
SSH3 has resistance to port scanning, UDP port forwarding, and
connection migration.

 WHY WE THINK (41 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Increasing test-time compute, or "thinking time," can greatly improve
LLM performance, especially in complex reasoning tasks. This article
discusses techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, parallel
sampling, and sequential revision to use this thinking time.
Reinforcement learning approaches are also discussed, along with the
challenge of making models provide faithful and human-readable
reasoning. 

 SMALL DATA (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The "Small Data" movement advocates for simpler and cheaper solutions
over Big Data, driven by the fact that most organizations don't use
massive amounts of data. While large-scale systems are appealing, the
median query often scans relatively small amounts of data, easily
handled by a single, powerful node. Modern hardware, including SSDs
and CPUs, has drastically improved in speed, capacity, and
cost-effectiveness, making single-node solutions even more viable. 

 WHY TODAY'S PYTHON DEVELOPERS ARE EMBRACING TYPE HINTS (11 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Python's popularity continues to grow, especially in AI and data
science, but its dynamic typing can lead to reliability issues as
projects scale. However, Python does support types. Python type hints,
introduced by PEP 484, address this by allowing developers to add
static type annotations.

 POSTGRESQL PERFORMANCE COMPARISON (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The newly released Postgres 18 is the fastest version. 

 FUNDAMENTAL OF VIRTUAL MEMORY (19 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Virtual memory uses techniques like paging and demand paging to
abstract physical memory, allowing processes to access more memory
than physically available, manage memory efficiently, and isolate
processes from each other. 

 DAYFLOW (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Dayflow is an open-source macOS app that automatically generates a
timeline of your daily screen activity with AI summaries and
distraction highlights by taking a screenshot of your screen every 15
minutes. 

 WRITE THE "STUPID" CODE (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Write "stupid" code and experiment with new technologies without
criticizing yourself.
