ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE 1 HOUR PER YEAR BUG (BUT ONLY IN PACIFIC TIME!) (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Google Docs encountered a peculiar bug in 2021. Users in the Pacific
Time Zone reported seeing timestamps for new comments and replies in
Docs that were displayed as being created "tomorrow", despite being
created the previous day. The cause was traced to an error in the date
formatting logic used by Google Docs, which incorrectly calculated the
number of hours between the current time and a past time due to the
change in time zone offset caused by daylight saving time. This bug
only affected users in the Pacific Time Zone during the single hour
when daylight saving time transitioned. 

 NEXT.JS + SUPABASE APP IN PRODUCTION: WHAT WOULD I DO DIFFERENTLY (13
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This developer built a mid-sized Next.js application with Supabase
and, as a result, he recommends using server components for data
fetching, server actions for data mutations, and shared utility
wrappers for authorization, validation, and authentication. In terms
of database design, the developer emphasizes the importance of using
surrogate keys, implementing row-level security (RLS) in a performant
way, and utilizing server-side routing for mutations. 

 EVERYTHING ABOUT GOOGLE TRANSLATE CRASHING REACT (AND OTHER WEB APPS)
(21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google Translate can cause significant issues for modern web apps
that rely on dynamic DOM manipulation, especially React applications.
These issues stem from Google Translate's modification of the DOM. The
responsibility lies with browser extension developers to minimize
interference with web apps. A platform-level solution might be
necessary in the future.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I'VE BUILT MY FIRST SUCCESSFUL SIDE PROJECT, AND I HATE IT (22 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This developer built a successful side project that generated over
$15,000 in revenue, but he quickly grew tired of the maintenance and
customer support demands. While he initially enjoyed the
entrepreneurial adventure, the constant stream of emails, disputes,
and requests for features became overwhelming, especially after he
stopped using the project himself. The developer ended up putting the
project on autopilot by automating payment processing, trial access,
and customer support. 

 THE DYING WEB (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The dominance of Chrome has created a browser monoculture, which has
resulted in websites being optimized for Chrome. While convincing
people to switch to other browsers is hard, it's important to try
other browsers so that the web stays open and alive. 

 BEING ON THE SEMANTIC WEB IS EASY, AND, FRANKLY, WELL WORTH THE
BOTHER (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Semantic Web refers to machine-readable websites. This technology
is already widely adopted and utilizes JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data)
to embed metadata within web pages, providing information for bots and
search engines to interpret content more effectively. Its use results
in better website previews, richer search results, and increased
discoverability for web content.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE U.S. NAVY'S $100 MILLION CHECKBOX (27 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A poorly designed user interface contributed to the 2017 collision of
the USS John S McCain. A confusing checkbox on a touchscreen caused
the crew to lose control of the ship's propellers, leading to a
collision with a tanker. Afterwards, the Navy reverted to physical
controls. 

 AN UNPOPULAR PERSPECTIVE ON THE SSO TAX (13 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The so-called "SSO Tax" in SaaS pricing is not an unfair practice but
rather a form of price discrimination that is both logical and
beneficial for both vendors and customers. Price discrimination is
inherent in any market, as buyers have different preferences and
willingness to pay. Vendors need to segment their customers to
maximize their revenue. For example, airlines have different pricing
tiers that allow vendors to offer more affordable basic tiers while
still catering to the needs of high-paying customers. 

 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS LOSING HYPE (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 AI enthusiasm is going down. Some argue this dip is merely a natural
part of the "hype cycle," but others think that AI won't be able to
provide the value that it was promised to provide.

 COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT HOW TO OPTIMIZE LCP (10 MINUTE READ) [22]


 While optimizing images is important for LCP, field data shows that
improving the time to first byte (TTFB), reducing resource load delay,
and minimizing render delay are larger factors in getting good LCP
performance.
