ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SNEAKY REACT MEMORY LEAKS: HOW THE REACT COMPILER WON'T SAVE YOU (11
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The new React compiler has some limitations in addressing memory
leaks caused by closures, particularly in the context of memoization
hooks. While the compiler effectively caches values that don't depend
on state or props, it doesn't prevent the underlying issue of shared
closure contexts that can lead to prolonged memory retention. The
author demonstrates this with a code example where creating a new
object dependent on state within a memoized function results in a
memory leak despite the compiler's memoization. 

 WEIRD THINGS I LEARNED WHILE WRITING AN X86 EMULATOR (12 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 This article explores unusual aspects of the x86 instruction set
architecture discovered while creating an x86 emulator for time travel
debugging. There are multiple encodings for the same instructions in
the architecture. It uses prefixes to modify instruction behavior. The
author also notes the peculiar nature of segment overrides in both
32-bit and 64-bit modes, the surprising behavior of shift
instructions, and the inconsistent handling of flags by different
instructions. 

 REAL-TIME AUDIO PROGRAMMING 101: TIME WAITS FOR NOTHING (11 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Real-time audio programming requires avoiding any code that might
cause delays or unpredictable behavior, as such glitches would disrupt
the smooth flow of audio data and lead to undesirable sound artifacts.
People working with real-time audio need to understand worst-case
execution times and avoid common pitfalls like locking, memory
allocation, and external events within the audio callback function. To
achieve seamless audio processing, employ lock-free data structures
and atomic operations for communication between real-time and
non-real-time contexts.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOUR PAIN IN 2024 AS A WEB DEVELOPER (REDDIT THREAD) [7] 

 Web developers have a hard time keeping up with new developments that
are happening all the time. They also feel like they don't have enough
time and/or are getting bored of their jobs. 

 MARGIN OF SAFETY - MENTAL MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Margin of Safety is a mental model that emphasizes the importance of
accounting for potential errors and uncertainties when making
estimations. It essentially acts as a buffer, preventing failure by
providing extra capacity to handle unexpected events. It's a useful
model to apply when estimating software projects (and most other
things in life).

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 üëâ GET 80% AUTOMATED E2E TEST COVERAGE BY OCTOBER (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Over 2/3rd of dev teams test less than 50% of their workflows,
causing bugs to sneak out. QA Wolf [9] gets your organization to 80%
automated E2E test coverage in less than 4 months.

They create and maintain your test suite in open-source Playwright.
Plus, they provide unlimited parallel test runs [9] on their
infrastructure (24-hour maintenance included).

The results? With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [10] achieved
4x more test cases and 86% faster QA cycles.

 POSTING V1 (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Posting is an HTTP client that lives in your terminal. It can be used
over SSH and enables efficient keyboard-centric workflows. Your
requests are stored locally in simple YAML files, so they're easy to
read and version control. 

 VUE VINE (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Vine is a new syntax for organizing Vue components within a single
file. It addresses the common pain point of navigating between
multiple files when developing small, reusable components. It helps
handle the increasingly logic-heavy nature of frontend development
better. 

 TAILKITS (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Tailkits is a TailwindCSS template directory.

 GITHUB COPILOT EXTENSIONS ARE ALL YOU NEED (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GitHub Copilot Extensions are a new way to enhance VS Code by
integrating AI directly into the developer workflow. These extensions
utilize LLMs to provide context-specific answers, generate code, and
offer insights within VSCode itself. Developers can build custom chat
participants using the Chat API and access LLMs directly through the
Language Model API. 

 ASKING AN LLM TO BUILD A SIMPLE WEB TOOL (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This author used ChatGPT to build a simple web tool for configuring
box shadows. They were impressed by ChatGPT's ability to create a
functional tool without any external dependencies. Despite requiring
some manual adjustments for aesthetics and layout, the process was
efficient, with ChatGPT reliably modifying only the parts requested. 

 LEVELS OF COMPLEXITY: RAG APPLICATIONS (13 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This roadmap is an overview of RAG (retrieval augmented generation).
It starts with the basics of RAG, explaining how to traverse file
systems, chunk and batch text, and interact with embedding APIs. It
then progresses to more advanced techniques, including asynchronous
programming, improved chunking strategies, and robust retry
mechanisms. The roadmap also goes over observability and evaluation
techniques.

 JUDGE DISMISSES LAWSUIT OVER GITHUB COPILOT AI CODING ASSISTANT (3
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A US judge has dismissed a lawsuit alleging that GitHub Copilot
violated open-source licenses by using code samples for AI training. 

 NO MORE BOOT LOADER: PLEASE USE THE KERNEL INSTEAD (35 MINUTE VIDEO)
[19] 

 Red Hat boot loader engineering is developing a new bootloader called
nmbl that uses the Linux kernel as its own bootloader, aiming to
replace GRUB with a fast, secure, and user-space solution.
