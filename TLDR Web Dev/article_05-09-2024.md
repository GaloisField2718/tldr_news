 AUTH DONE RIGHT WITH STYTCH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Stytch provides complete auth infrastructure for developers (far
beyond basic widgets) _and_ built-in fraud and risk prevention in a
single, API-first platform [5].¬†

You can easily implement enterprise auth features [6] like SSO, RBAC,
MFA, and SCIM. And with device fingerprinting [7], you can secure your
application from new AI threats.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWe migrated tens of millions of users from Auth0 to Stytch in less
than a month. It was far and away the easiest migration I've ever
worked on.‚Äù ‚Äî Archana S., Director of Engineering, Tome

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE BOOLEAN TRAP (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Using boolean flags in function parameters is a trap - enums should
probably be used instead. Boolean flags can lead to confusion and
maintenance issues, especially when dealing with multiple output
types. While boolean flags can be appropriate in specific cases, enums
are generally preferable for API and function parameters because they
are more readable, maintainable, extensible, and future-proof. 

 CSS @PROPERTY AND THE NEW STYLE (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CSS's @property is a new at-rule allowing explicit definition of
custom property syntax, initial value, and inheritance. This article
shows how @property enables smooth animations and transitions,
demonstrated by a shiny animated button with rotating gradients, a
silky smooth hover effect, and tiny shimmering dots. @property lets
developers create intricate designs and complex animations, previously
difficult or impossible with standard CSS. 

 COMPONENT TESTING IN STORYBOOK (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Component testing may be the future of UI testing. While end-to-end
(E2E) tests provide the highest fidelity, they are often impractical
for comprehensive UI coverage due to slow execution, difficulty in
managing complex states, and setup overhead. Component tests, on the
other hand, offer a balance between unit tests and E2E tests, allowing
for both faster and more reliable testing. Component tests are not
necessarily a replacement for E2E tests, but rather a complement.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 EXPLICIT IS BETTER THAN IMPLICIT (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Explicit code is better than implicit code because implicit code has
a higher number of WTFs per minute (basically being more frustrating
and confusing). This post presents two code examples to make this
point, showing how explicit code makes it easier to understand and
maintain the codebase by clearly defining variables and permissions. 

 THINGS I WISHED MORE DEVELOPERS KNEW ABOUT DATABASES (19 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Jaana Dogan, a Principal Engineer at Google, wrote a post about
database-related issues commonly overlooked. It emphasizes the
importance of understanding nuances like ACID compliance, isolation
levels, and data consistency. It also talks about the pitfalls of
auto-incrementing primary keys, optimistic locking, write skews, and
clock skews.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING @SVG-USE (16 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 @svg-use is a set of tools and bundler plugins that facilitate the
use of 'use href' for better SVG loading in a React context. It's more
efficient than the current common practice of inlining SVG as JS code.


 MIDDAY CREATE V1 (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This is an open-source starter kit for building production-ready SaaS
applications. It uses a curated stack of tools, including Next.js,
Supabase, and TailwindCSS, organized as a monorepo with a focus on
code reuse and best practices. 

 FETCHFOX (WEBSITE) [15] 

 FetchFox is a Chrome extension for extracting any data from any
website. It takes the raw text of a website and uses AI to extract
data the user is looking for.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A REAL LIFE OFF-BY-ONE ERROR (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 There was a subtle off-by-one error during the European Climbing
Championships in Villars-sur-Ollon. A hold on the right-hand side of
the wall was off by one position compared to its counterpart on the
left side. Despite the error going unnoticed for years, this author
spotted it because he had a reference point from a previous
competition and was not visually fatigued by repeated exposure to the
same wall. 

 INTEL HONESTY (16 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Intel once dominated the chip industry. Despite its historic success,
Intel's failure to adapt to changing market demands, particularly in
mobile and AI, has led to a situation where its foundry business,
Intel Foundry, is struggling to compete with industry leaders like
TSMC. Intel Foundry's existence is no longer justified by market
forces and the U.S. government will need to provide substantial
financial support, such as purchase guarantees, for it to survive. 

 EXACTLY-ONCE PAYMENTS AT AIRBNB (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Airbnb manages the challenge of idempotency in payment processing by
coordinating both client and server systems to avoid double charges,
despite the technical impossibility of "exactly-once" delivery in
distributed systems. Airbnb's approach involves splitting requests
into phases and ensuring mutual exclusion to handle retries
effectively.
