 WHY BUILD A NOTETAKER BOT FOR YOUR APP? THIS API HAS YOUR COVERED
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 A notetaker bot goes beyond transcription to generate summaries,
action items, formatted notes – and (if implemented wisely) big
revenue for your application. But try to create one yourself and
you'll quickly find that building a bot to take the minutes can
take… well, months.

The Nylas Notetaker [5] is one API for all your recording, analysis,
and transcription needs. It sends meeting bots to join Google Meet,
Microsoft Teams, and Zoom calls, and forwards the recordings &
diarized transcripts [5] direct to your application. The results? The
industry's fastest setup, highest quality, and happiest customers.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 ADVANCED REACT IN THE WILD (34 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Companies like Vio, DoorDash, Preply, GeekyAnts, and Inngest have
tackled performance and architecture challenges in large React and
Next.js apps. This post uses these companies as case studies for
techniques such as optimizing Interaction to Next Paint (INP),
migrating from CSR to SSR, using React Server Components, and adopting
the Next.js App Router. 

 MORE ACCURATE DEVTOOLS PERFORMANCE DEBUGGING USING REAL-WORLD DATA (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chrome DevTools now includes CPU throttling calibration, allowing
devs to generate accurate performance presets for low- and mid-tier
mobile devices based on their own hardware. This helps simulate
real-world user experiences more reliably, especially for CPU-bound
tasks. DevTools also integrates field data from CrUX to suggest
realistic settings and highlight mismatches between lab and real-user
performance. 

 SOME NICE THINGS WITH SVG (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post goes over SVG animation techniques with code examples
written in JSX. It shows how to create animated wires using SVG lines,
masks, and CSS animations using methods like masking animated blocks.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 CLEVER CODE IS PROBABLY THE WORST CODE YOU COULD WRITE (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Clear, readable code is more valuable than clever code in the long
run. Even though clear code might seem trivial, it's actually more
difficult to write and maintain. Documentation is important for
demonstrating the complexity of the work. 

 A REDDIT BOT DROVE ME INSANE (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 An AI-powered Reddit bot was faking human connection to secretly
promote AI-illustrated books. It went viral because it sounded so
human-like. 

 43 THINGS WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HIRING AT POSTHOG (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 PostHog has reviewed 30,000 applications, interviewed 2,000
candidates, and hired 65 people in a year. The best advice it has for
hiring is to write job ads that actually stand out, make interview
processes simpler, pay candidates for their time, be transparent about
salary, and focus on culture fit over credentials.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DASHBOARDS DON'T FIX BUGS. ARE YOUR OBSERVABILITY TOOLS ACTUALLY
HELPING? (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Observability tools overwhelm you with data, and at the end of the
day you still don't know where your code went wrong. Instead of just
showing you another graph about how something's broken, Sentry hands
you real context about your code [12] with stack traces, replays, and
commits. Make sense of your code, start debugging. [12] 

 FASTIFY VITE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This Fastify plugin allows you to run Vite's development server as
middleware and expose your Vite app to your Fastify application. It
has configuration hooks to simplify router integration and other
customizations. 

 EXPO SDK 53 BETA IS NOW AVAILABLE (19 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Expo SDK 53 beta is now available with support for React Native 0.79
and React 19. It has the New Architecture enabled by default.
Edge-to-edge display is also enabled by default for new Android
projects, with plans to extend this to existing projects in SDK 54.
There's also a new experimental Expo UI package for integrating Swift
UI and Jetpack Compose, alongside experimental support for caching
local builds for faster development. 

 WEBTUI (WEBSITE) [15] 

 WebTUI is a CSS library that allows devs to create visually appealing
Terminal-like UIs within web browsers.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WRITING CURSOR RULES WITH A CURSOR RULE (16 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Devs can use Cursor rules to provide LLMs with consistent
project-specific instructions. The best strategy is to create a
"meta-cursor rule" – a template that guides AI in generating new
rules based on conversations or specific ideas. This approach makes
rule creation easier and is more efficient. 

 ESSAYS ON PROGRAMMING I THINK ABOUT A LOT (13 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This is an index of programming essays along with summaries of what
they're about. The essays cover topics like approaches to software
development, how to make technical decisions, how to succeed as an
engineer at a startup, and more. Each entry in the list includes a bit
about the lessons learned from the essay along with an excerpt. 

 WHAT ARE AI AGENTS? WHY DO THEY MATTER? (18 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AI agents are autonomous programs that use AI models and tools to
achieve specific goals through a series of interactions, unlike
traditional AI models that usually have single input-output exchanges.
This autonomy allows agents to understand their environment, make
decisions, take actions, and maintain context over time, letting them
handle complex, multi-step tasks. New standardized protocols like MCP
and A2A show that agents are going to be more prominent in the future.

equity compensation, including stock options, restricted stock, and
restricted stock units, to help employees, hiring managers, and
founders make informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes in C-corps
in the USA. 

 GOOGLE IS WINNING ON EVERY AI FRONT (10 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Google DeepMind, with its state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 and
its integration across Google's ecosystem, has surpassed competitors
like OpenAI and Anthropic in the AI race in performance,
cost-effectiveness, and hardware capabilities. 

 ARKTYPE (WEBSITE) [21] 

 ArkType is a 1:1 TypeScript validator for both editor and runtime
environments. 

 EVERYTHING WRONG WITH MCP (18 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 The Model Context Protocol (MCP), a growing standard for integrating
third-party data and tools with LLM-powered chats and agents, still
has some vulnerabilities and limitations in protocol security, UI/UX,
and LLM security.
