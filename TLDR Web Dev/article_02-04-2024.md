ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW LEVELS.FYI BUILT SCALABLE SEARCH WITH POSTGRESQL (6 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Levels.fyi developed a scalable fuzzy search solution using
PostgreSQL to help users quickly find relevant salary information. Its
team's initial approach used simple LIKE queries, but evolved to use
materialized views for optimization and full-text search with tsvector
for improved results. To further improve search accuracy, they
implemented a custom relevance algorithm that used factors like exact
matches, popularity, and similarity. 

 BUILDING A MICRO HTMX SSR FRAMEWORK (25 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This blog post dives into how you can use Fastify, Vite, and
@fastify/vite to produce a small, low-overhead application setup that
has the absolute minimal set of dependencies and moving parts. This
setup achieved similar SSR performance but with a fraction of
dependencies from Astro, making the overall development setup much
smaller. The post first gives a crash course on Vite, then walks
through how to integrate it into Fastify applications, before finally
moving on to the rewrite. 

 HOW SLACK AUTOMATES DEPLOYS (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Slack automated deployments with a program called ReleaseBot.
ReleaseBot monitors deployments, detects anomalies using z-scores and
dynamic thresholds, and can pause or roll back deployments if
necessary. This proved to be a big improvement compared to Slack‚Äôs
previous process, which involved engineers serving as ‚ÄúDeployment
Commanders‚Äù that oversaw manual deploys.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO SELF-MANAGE EVEN IF YOU HAVE A MANAGER (YOUR FUTURE SELF WILL
THANK YOU) (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Self-management allows you to work independently, builds trust with
your manager, and frees you both to focus on strategic goals. To
self-manage effectively, developers should manage timelines well, be
self-motivated, give feedback, manage multiple stakeholders, and own
their career development. 

 THE TECH LEAD'S PLAYBOOK (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A tech lead's role involves setting a strategic direction,
influencing project staffing, and ensuring successful execution. They
identify key problems, propose solutions, seek alignment across teams,
and collaborate to secure resources for their initiatives. While tech
leads still write code, their success relies heavily on strong
communication and interpersonal skills to guide the team and promote
the project's visibility. 

 DEVELOPING ESSENTIAL SOFT SKILLS FOR ENGINEERS AND LEADERS (12 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Some of the most important soft skills include empathy,
communication, adaptability, problem-solving, and leadership. Learning
soft skills takes effort, but can be done through practice,
self-reflection, seeking feedback, and utilizing resources like books
and courses.

 HEADLINE DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Headline-driven development is a method for shipping software by
creating and focusing on a stream of short, clear headlines that
communicate the key features of each release before writing any code.
This approach helps prioritize the most important features and cuts
out any unnecessary work. 

 YOUR AI PRODUCT NEEDS EVALS (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 For AI products to succeed and improve over time, it‚Äôs important to
have an evaluation approach. This article lays out a three-level
approach. First, unit tests should assert expected AI outputs. Second,
tools should log AI interactions for easy analysis. Lastly, AI
products should have A/B testing to better understand user behavior. 

 THE WI-FI ONLY WORKS WHEN IT'S RAINING (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This author had a weird internet problem where their home Wi-Fi
connection would only work when it was raining. Debugging revealed
that a neighbor's tree had grown tall enough to intermittently
obstruct the signal. The rain would weigh down the branches,
temporarily clearing the obstruction, but the connection would fail
again as the tree dried. The author upgraded their Wi-Fi hardware to a
newer standard that was more resistant to interference to fix the
issue.
