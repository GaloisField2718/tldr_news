ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DOTSLASH: SIMPLIFIED EXECUTABLE DEPLOYMENT (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DotSlash is an open-source tool developed by Meta that manages large
executables efficiently by replacing them with small text files. These
files tell DotSlash where to download and verify the actual executable
for your platform. This avoids storing large binaries in source
control and reduces clone times. DotSlash is used at Meta for managing
internal tools and open-source projects alike and it integrates with
GitHub releases for easy distribution. 

 REMIX TAKES ON NEXT.JS IN BATTLE OF THE REACT FRAMEWORKS (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Remix and Astro are currently getting a lot of buzz as simpler
alternatives to Next.js, the dominant framework of the React era.
Remix is a more direct competitor to Next.js, since they are both
based on the React library, but its origins go back a full decade.
This article looks at what inspired the creators of Remix to start the
framework and how Remix tackles the complexity of React. Shopify, for
example, is using Remix internally for its admin dashboard and apps.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT IT WAS LIKE WORKING FOR GITLAB (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This author shares their learnings from their time at GitLab,
focusing on aspects like company culture, product development, and
team structure. GitLab prioritized self-hosted installations over the
SaaS offering, leading to performance issues. Since GitLab offered
both a SaaS and self-hosted model, it created conflicts of interest
and challenges in maintaining separate codebases. Using Ruby on Rails
allowed the company to grow fast, but created some challenges with
performance and maintainability. 

 HOW TO HIRE LOW EXPERIENCE, HIGH POTENTIAL PEOPLE (8 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Hiring inexperienced but high-potential individuals can be valuable
for startups. Some tips on identifying such individuals include
assessing their "wins above replacement," unconventional path, chip on
their shoulder, positivity, high EQ, "theory of excellence," openness,
and sense of humor. Finding such candidates is like looking for
diamonds in the rough, but taking calculated risks on unconventional
candidates can often pay off well. 

 HOW TO ONBOARD (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 To onboard a new company or team effectively as a software engineer,
it‚Äôs helpful to start by building knowledge and relationships
quickly through targeted conversations with colleagues. Then,
contributing code quickly, even through small changes, helps solidify
understanding and integrate into the team even faster. Onboarding
buddies and well-structured processes like documentation and backlog
support smooth the process.

combination of traditional search and more generative AI experiences. 

 SHOULD YOU STAY TECHNICAL AS AN ENGINEERING MANAGER? (10 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 While staying "hands-on" with coding decreases as you climb the
leadership ladder, maintaining technical knowledge ("staying
technical") is still important. It allows you to understand your
team's challenges, make informed decisions, and communicate
effectively. Aim to dedicate 20% of your time to technical activities
like attending meetings, contributing to documentation, working on
small internal tools, and participating in ongoing learning.
