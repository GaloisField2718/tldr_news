ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE ROOTED COPILOT (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Eye Security researchers discovered a vulnerability in Microsoft's
Copilot Enterprise that allowed code execution in a live Python
sandbox. By exploiting the ability to run Jupyter Notebook commands,
they got root access within the container by poisoning the `pgrep`
command, but found limited ways to use this privilege due to security
mitigations. They reported the issue to Microsoft, which fixed it as a
moderate-severity vulnerability, and were acknowledged for their
research. 

 PERFORMANCE AND TELEMETRY ANALYSIS OF TRAE IDE: A DEEP DIVE INTO
BYTEDANCE'S VSCODE FORK (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Trae IDE, a ByteDance fork of VSCode, has some issues. It consumes
more resources than VSCode, with up to 6 times the memory usage and a
much higher process count. Telemetry data is persistently transmitted
to ByteDance servers, even when telemetry settings are disabled by the
user, collecting granular system and usage information.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 NEVER WRITE YOUR OWN DATE PARSING LIBRARY (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The creator of Eleventy started replacing the Luxon date parsing
library due to its large size. He explored alternatives like dayjs but
found them inaccurate, leading him to create a new RFC 9557-compatible
library called `@11ty/parse-date-strings`. This new library offers a
smaller bundle size and prepares Eleventy for future native Temporal
API support. 

 IT'S TIME FOR MODERN CSS TO KILL THE SPA (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Modern CSS features like View Transitions and Speculation Rules have
made Single Page Applications (SPAs) obsolete. SPAs were initially
adopted to create smoother, app-like navigation, but they often result
in performance issues and unnecessary complexity. 

 DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP, USE THE WEBSITE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Don't download apps when websites offer the same functionality. Apps
can access contacts, location, microphone, and installed apps -
information that websites struggle to obtain.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [9] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

QA Wolf's AI-native service SUPPORTS WEB AND MOBILE APPS, delivering
80% automated test coverage in weeks [10] and helping teams SHIP 5X
FASTER by reducing QA cycles to minutes.

QA Wolf [11] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs for mobile and web apps
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes guarantee

The result? Drata [12] achieved 4x more test cases and 86% FASTER QA
CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 VANILLA JAVASCRIPT SUPPORT FOR TAILWIND PLUS (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tailwind Plus now offers full Vanilla JavaScript support for its UI
blocks through a new library called `@tailwindplus/elements`. This
library provides headless custom elements that handle complex UI
behaviors without requiring a JavaScript framework. 

 ES-TOOLKIT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 ES-Toolkit is a high-performance JavaScript utility library designed
to replace lodash with better speed and smaller bundle size. It has
various utility functions with modern implementations and supports
tree shaking and TypeScript out of the box.

MISCELLANEOUS

 RUST RUNNING ON EVERY GPU (19 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A Rust developer has created a demo allowing a single Rust codebase
to run on various GPU platforms, including CUDA, SPIR-V, Metal,
DirectX 12, WebGPU, and even CPU fallback. This removes the need for
specialized shader languages, letting standard Rust code be directly
compiled for GPU targets. The project uses Rust GPU, Rust CUDA, and
Naga to bridge different graphics backends and compile kernels to
appropriate device formats. 

 PROGRAMMING VEHICLES IN GAMES (36 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Vehicle simulation can be broken down into three core components: the
engine/gearbox, the tires, and the chassis. It's important to
understand both the mechanical aspects and the desired driving
experience. This article goes into the intricacies of tire modeling,
including slip ratio, slip angle, and the friction circle, offering
code examples and visual aids. 

 THE FUTURE IS NOT SELF-HOSTED (12 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Relying on corporate cloud services means we don't truly own our
digital content, but instead rent it. This dev built his own home
server as an alternative, but realized self-hosting is impractical and
isolating. Instead, he proposes community-hosted cloud services funded
publicly.

 FONT-SIZE-ADJUST IS USEFUL (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The CSS `font-size-adjust` property with a fixed value normalizes
font sizes across different fonts on a webpage. 

 MAKING POSTGRES 42,000X SLOWER BECAUSE I AM UNEMPLOYED (15 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 A web dev shows how they successfully made a Postgres database 42,000
times slower by tweaking configuration parameters in
`postgresql.conf`, focusing on disabling caching, maximizing
background processes, reducing WAL efficiency, essentially deleting
indexes and forcing single-threaded I/O. 

 WINDSURF EMPLOYEE #2: I WAS GIVEN A PAYOUT OF ONLY 1% WHAT MY SHARES
WERE WORTH (2 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Prem Qu Nair explains his decision to join Cognition, the company
that created AI software engineer Devin, despite a significant
financial loss from forfeiting vested shares at his previous company,
Windsurf, due to a time-sensitive offer from Google DeepMind. 

 THE MANY, MANY, MANY JAVASCRIPT RUNTIMES OF THE LAST DECADE (22
MINUTE READ) [22] 

 The JavaScript ecosystem has exploded in the last decade with
numerous runtimes and engines optimized for environments like edge
computing, microcontrollers, and native applications, reflecting a
shift from browser-centricity to execution everywhere.
