 1 BUG, $50,000+ IN BOUNTIES, HOW ZENDESK INTENTIONALLY LEFT A
BACKDOOR IN HUNDREDS OF FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A 15-year-old bug hunter discovered a vulnerability in Zendesk's
email collaboration feature that allowed attackers to access customer
support tickets from any company using the service. This exploit was
initially dismissed by Zendesk's bug bounty program as "out of scope,"
but subsequent public disclosure of the vulnerability forced Zendesk
to take action. The bug hunter then discovered a second, more serious
exploit that could allow attackers to gain access to private Slack
workspaces using Zendesk, which was fixed later. 

 NODE.JS, PIPES, AND DISAPPEARING BYTES (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Piping large amounts of JSON data from a Node.js command to another
command results in truncated output. The issue stems from the
asynchronous nature of Node.js's `process.stdout.write` when writing
to a pipe on POSIX systems. When the pipe buffer is full,
`process.stdout.write` returns false, and further writes are blocked
until the pipe is read. The solution involves subscribing to the
`drain` event of the `process.stdout` stream to resume writing after
the pipe has been filled. 

 THE INTERACTIVE GUIDE TO RENDERING IN REACT (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 React re-renders a component only when its state changes, triggered
by an event handler that modifies the state using useState's updater
function. It handles multiple updates within an event handler by
batching them, applying only the result of the last invocation.
StrictMode is a development mode that forces components to re-render
twice to ensure purity and resilience.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 3 CAREER PRINCIPLES THAT GOT ME TO DIRECTOR AT GOOGLE (10 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 A former Google director shares three career principles that helped
her achieve five promotions in ten years: Glue, Grit, and Friction.
Glue refers to the less glamorous tasks that are vital for team
success but might not be directly promotable. Grit is a commitment to
pursuing long-term goals despite challenges and viewing failures as
opportunities for learning. Friction represents the gap between
reality and the ideal state. It must be overcome to show a force
multiplier effect. 

 WRITE DOWN THE PLAN (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Writing down plans is a simple yet powerful habit that can help one's

amongst teams, and increases visibility. 

 LESSONS FROM PLAIN TEXT (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Plain text is more complex than it seems on the surface. For example,
tabs and spaces differences can cause inconsistencies during
collaboration. Soft-wrapping text is better for improved readability
and compatibility.

 $2 H100S: HOW THE GPU BUBBLE BURST (23 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The price of H100 GPUs has plummeted from $8/hour to under $2/hour in
just a year. This is due to the resales of reserved compute, the rise
of open-source models for fine-tuning, and a decline in the number of
companies developing new foundation models. 

 HOW GENAI WILL IMPACT DATA ENGINEERING (11 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Generative AI is a fundamental shift that will push data engineers to
merge with data analysts to focus on business needs and merge with
software engineers to own online systems end-to-end. Current data
engineers should try to get ahead by incorporating LLMs into their
workflows, exploring AI infrastructure, and staying informed about
advancements in the field. 

 DESIGNING A FAST CONCURRENT HASH TABLE (17 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Papaya is a fast and concurrent hash table for Rust. It uses a novel
approach to address the challenges of lock-free design, including
using a metadata table for cache efficiency and a probabilistic
approach to resizing. It also uses various memory reclamation
strategies to be faster than other concurrent Rust hash tables in
terms of read throughput, latency, and async support.
