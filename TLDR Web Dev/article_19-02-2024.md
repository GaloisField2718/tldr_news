 JAVASCRIPT ON DEMAND: HOW QWIK DIFFERS FROM REACT HYDRATION (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Qwik, a web framework, offers a unique approach to managing
client-side JavaScript, focusing on "resumability" and loading
JavaScript on demand. This method contrasts with React's hydration
process by aiming to improve performance and efficiency in web
applications. Qwik's strategy reduces initial load times and enhances
interactivity by only loading the necessary JavaScript code when
needed. 

 SEQUENTIAL A/B TESTING KEEPS THE WORLD STREAMING NETFLIX PART 1:
CONTINUOUS DATA (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Netflix developed a statistical procedure for A/B testing to detect
changes in software performance. The traditional fixed-horizon testing
methods are not suitable for this task because they require waiting
for a predetermined amount of data before analysis, which can delay
the detection of important regressions. The new method, called
sequential testing, allows for continuous analysis of data streams and
provides guarantees on false positive rates. It has been successfully
implemented at Netflix to prevent bugs and performance regressions
from reaching production.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 10 THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AT AMAZON (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This author worked as a software engineer at Amazon from 2019 to
2024. Some of the surprising things they found from working there
include how supportive most of their team was, how the company could
act both big and small, and how easy it was to move between teams.
However, on the negative side, they didn‚Äôt like working on a team
with a lot of technical debt and having a manager who didn't know much
about software engineering. 

 A BEGINNER‚ÄôS GUIDE TO MAKING BEAUTIFUL SLIDES FOR YOUR TALKS (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article offers tips for creating beautiful slides for tech
talks. It emphasizes using good fonts, focusing on powerful editing
features like actions and smart objects in Photoshop, and keeping
design elements minimal. Slides should have a consistent visual theme
and contain visuals. They shouldn‚Äôt be overloaded with information. 

 I WORRY OUR COPILOT IS LEAVING SOME PASSENGERS BEHIND (20 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 GitHub Copilot may have negative consequences for accessibility on
the web. Examples of how Copilot can generate code that is
inaccessible to users with disabilities include using JavaScript to
create a link instead of a native HTML link or not using proper ARIA
attributes. Copilot is not very transparent about how it works and
there needs to be better quality control for tools like it.

 OBSERVABLE 2.0 (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Observable 2.0 is a platform focused on building data apps,
dashboards, and reports. It comes with Observable Framework, a static
site generator that combines the strengths of JavaScript for
interactive graphics with any language for data analysis. Framework
offers a better user experience with precomputed data for fast loading
and beautiful design, a better data architecture with flexible data
loaders that run on your servers for security and privacy, and a
better developer workflow with files, code review, and offline work. 

 UV (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 uv is an extremely fast and efficient Python package installer and
resolver designed to replace pip and pip-tools. It boasts 10-100x
faster speeds, uses a global cache to save space, and supports a wide
range of features like version overrides, conflict tracking, and
support for various dependency formats. 

 MAGIKA (GITHUB REPO) [12]

open-sourced by Google. It uses an optimized 1MB Keras model that
enables precise file identification within milliseconds. Magika is
currently used within Google to help improve Google users‚Äô safety by
routing Gmail, Drive, and Safe Browsing files to the proper security
and content policy scanners.

 I'VE PUT A COMPLEX CODEBASE INTO A SINGLE 120K-TOKEN PROMPT, AND
ASKED 7 QUESTIONS GPT-4 AND GEMINI 1.5. HERE ARE THE RESULTS! (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article compared LLMs Gemini 1.5 and GPT-4-Turbo-128K on their
ability to understand a complex 120K-token codebase. Gemini 1.5
outperformed GPT-4 in almost all aspects, demonstrating a better
understanding of the code syntax, memory layout, bug fixes, and
removed functions. While neither model achieves true AGI (Artificial
General Intelligence), Gemini's ability to navigate large contexts and
connect information is impressive. 

 THE STEEP RISE OF HACKERNEWS IN GOOGLE RANKINGS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Hacker News has seen a dramatic rise in Google rankings, likely due
to Google's "hidden gem" update prioritizing personal experiences. The
site saw a 162% visibility increase in the UK and 75% in the US. This
could lead to a potential increase in spam. 

 WE‚ÄôRE ENTERING A GOLDEN AGE OF ENGINEERING BIOLOGY (15 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Biology is a complex field that has been difficult to predict and
engineer. However, recent advancements in AI, lab automation, and
CRISPR are making it possible to build more predictive models of
biological systems and to edit DNA with greater precision.
