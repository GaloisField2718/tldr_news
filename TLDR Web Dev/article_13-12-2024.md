ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW GOOGLE TAKES THE PAIN OUT OF CODE REVIEWS, WITH 97% DEV
SATISFACTION (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's code review tool, Critique, is highly rated among software
engineers internally. This article looks at what makes Critique so
loved and explains how it pairs with Google's code review process. It
covers Google's guidelines for efficient code review, internal
statistics on Google code reviews, and how Google uses AI to speed up
code reviews for engineers. 

 THE SECRET LIFE OF DNS PACKETS: INVESTIGATING COMPLEX NETWORKS (11
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stripe experienced unexpected DNS errors manifested as SERVFAIL
responses, impacting internal requests. Investigation revealed a
backlog of reverse DNS lookups (PTR records) waiting on the VPC
resolver (10.0.0.2), despite seemingly normal query volume and
resource usage. Analyzing packet captures and Hadoop job logs
pinpointed a single job performing numerous reverse DNS lookups,
exceeding the VPC resolver's per-interface packet limit due to request
retries. 

 SMARTER THAN 'CTRL+F': LINKING DIRECTLY TO WEB PAGE CONTENT (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Text fragments allow linking directly to specific text on a web page
without needing an ID using a special URL syntax that highlights the
desired text. They improve user experience by making deep linking
easier and can even reveal hidden content when matched. This feature
is supported in most modern browsers, with custom styling possible
through the ::target-text pseudo-element.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DEAR OAUTH PROVIDERS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Several OAuth providers have inconsistencies in their token
endpoints. This post points out specific errors, such as incorrect
HTTP status codes (GitHub), non-standard JSON error responses
(Facebook), and deviations from the OAuth specification in parameter
usage (TikTok, Strava, and Naver). 

 PARKINSON'S LAW: IT'S REAL, SO USE IT (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Parkinson's Law, which states that work expands to fill the time
available, highlights the importance of deadlines in project
management. Setting challenging but achievable deadlines improves
productivity and forces prioritization, making sure the project's
scope, resources, and time constraints are all in line.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 IS MANUAL TESTING THE ROOT CAUSE OF YOUR SLOW RELEASES? (SPONSOR)
[10] 

 Every dev team wants to ship faster. But when E2E testing takes hours
to run, everything slows down. The alternative? Ditch manual testing
and try QA Wolf [10]. Run 100% of your test suite in parallel with
pass/fail results within 3 minutes, and no cap on test runs. Test
constantly. Deploy continuously. Start here [10] 

 LFI (WEBSITE) [11] 

 LFI is a JavaScript and TypeScript library that provides lazy,
functional iteration for synchronous, asynchronous, and concurrent
operations. Its concurrent iterables outperform alternatives like
`p-map` and `p-filter` by processing items independently. 

 DATAFUEL (WEBSITE) [12] 

 DataFuel is an API that transforms websites into structured data
suitable for LLMs. It has clean Markdown or JSON output optimized for
RAG systems and various AI applications, including model training and
knowledge base creation. 

 WREN AI (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Wren AI is an open-source SQL AI agent that allows users to extract
data insights through natural language queries in multiple languages.
It integrates with tools like Excel and Google Sheets and uses a
semantic engine to understand business context and generate accurate
SQL queries.

 DEVIN REVIEW: IS IT A BETTER AI CODING AGENT THAN CURSOR? (12 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Devin, a new $500/month AI coding agent accessed via Slack, is
compared to Cursor, an AI code editor. Devin is able to clone
repositories, generate code, and even deploy previews, but its
Slack-based workflow is cumbersome and unreliable compared to Cursor's
more integrated IDE approach. Cursor's real-time feedback and local
control are a much better experience than Devin's long wait times and
unpredictable results. 

 A CHATGPT CLONE, IN 3,000 BYTES OF C, BACKED BY GPT-2 (15 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 This post goes through the creation of a ChatGPT clone in
approximately 3,000 bytes of C code using the GPT-2 model. The program
implements GPT-2's functionality, including tokenization, transformer
architecture, and inference, using a custom linear algebra library. 

 "RULES" THAT TERMINAL PROGRAMS FOLLOW (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Some unwritten "rules" of terminal program behavior include using
Ctrl-C to quit non-interactive programs and Ctrl-D to exit REPLs on
empty lines. Other rules include color limitations (16 colors),
readline keybinding mimicry, and the use of "-" to represent
stdin/stdout.

READ) [17] 

 Google, in partnership with Samsung and Qualcomm, announced Android
XR, a new operating system for headsets and glasses that uses AI to
create immersive experiences and integrate easily with existing
Android apps and services. 

 THE GPU IS NOT ALWAYS FASTER (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 While GPUs are great for parallel applications, a vectorized CPU can
outperform a GPU for specific tasks like dot products due to factors
like memory bandwidth limitations. 

 THE OPEN SOCIAL WEB IS THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET. HERE'S WHY I'M
EXCITED (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The open social web, with platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky, offers
a decentralized, user-controlled alternative to traditional social
media, which is exciting because of the greater level of user freedom
offered.
