ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HANDLING BILLIONS OF INVOCATIONS – BEST PRACTICES FROM AWS LAMBDA
(12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Lambda manages asynchronous requests using internal queues and
addresses challenges like noisy neighbors and traffic spikes through
techniques like simple queueing, consistent hashing, and
shuffle-sharding. Shuffle-sharding, which randomly assigns tenants to
multiple queues, is quite effective for workload isolation and fault
tolerance. The AWS team has multiple methods in practice for smooth
Lambda function operations, including proactive detection, automated
isolation, resilience, failure handling, and many observability
metrics. 

 MEMORY SAFETY FOR WEB FONTS (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Chrome replaced FreeType with Skrifa, a Rust-based font processing
library, to improve memory safety and reduce security vulnerabilities
related to web fonts. FreeType is written in unsafe code and has a
history of security issues that cost Google significant resources to
address. Skrifa uses Rust's memory safety features and has rigorous
testing to provide a more secure and reliable solution. 

 LIFE ALTERING POSTGRESQL PATTERNS (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article goes over a few important PostgreSQL patterns. For
example, it recommends using UUID primary keys as the tradeoffs are
usually worth it. Also, `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
should always be automatically added in tables and `on update restrict
on delete restrict` for foreign key constraints should always be set.
Enum tables should be used for controlled values, tables should be
named singularly, and soft deletes should be used instead of real,
hard deletes.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY AI WILL NEVER REPLACE HUMAN CODE REVIEW (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI will not fully replace human code review because humans understand
context, need collaboration, and provide accountability. AI can assist
with routine scanning and identifying potential issues, but it lacks
the domain expertise, forward-thinking alignment, and ability to learn
from experience that human reviewers possess. Also, code review serves
as a valuable platform for teaching, learning, and building a shared
understanding of the system for teams. 

 WHY I'M NO LONGER TALKING TO ARCHITECTS ABOUT MICROSERVICES (7 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Debates about microservices are often unproductive. The term
"microservice" doesn't have a consistent definition, which results in
confusion and abstract discussions disconnected from actual business
goals. Also, adopting microservices without accompanying
organizational changes, such as cross-functional teams and
decentralized decision-making, makes the change pointless. 

 HOW I USE AI CODING TOOLS AS A RAILS DEV (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This Rails dev uses LLMs for debugging, code completion, and code
generation. He prefers RubyMine, but mentions that Cursor has
potential and sees a future of seamless AI collaboration within IDEs.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CODEMCP (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Codemcp is a tool that integrates Claude Pro with a local codebase,
allowing AI to directly implement features, fix bugs, and refactor
code with file editing and test execution. The main benefit of it is
that it uses Claude Desktop instead of the Claude API, which makes it
much cheaper comparatively. Codemcp is IDE agnostic and is configured
via `codemcp.toml` for defining commands like formatting and testing. 

 NODE MODULES INSPECTOR (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 An interactive tool that lets you visualize your node_modules and
inspect dependencies of your local project. 

 MCP SERVER CLOUDFLARE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This is a Cloudflare MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows
devs to manage and interact with various Cloudflare services like
Workers, KV, R2, and D1 using natural language commands through an MCP
client like Claude Desktop. It has features for managing storage,
databases, AI models, and more.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LLM AGENTS ARE SIMPLY GRAPH — TUTORIAL FOR DUMMIES (14 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Agents are basically graphs with decision nodes, action nodes, and
loops, allowing them to "think," take actions, and learn from results.
The tutorial uses PocketFlow, a 100-line framework, to show how to
build a basic research agent that can answer questions by searching
the web. It breaks down the agent into simple "stations" (nodes) and
defines the flow between them. 

 AI'S EFFECTS ON PROGRAMMING JOBS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI isn't replacing programming jobs but creating more of them by
creating a new layer of abstraction. This abstraction will enable
individuals with structured thinking skills, but less knowledge of
coding languages, to become "software developers" who instruct AI.
Overall, software production will increase, but mediocre devs might be
replaced.

QUICK LINKS

 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT HAS TOO MUCH SOFTWARE IN IT (6 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Software development is burdened by excessive complexity and
unnecessary tools, including trendy frameworks, overzealous unit
testing, and a lack of developer input in product direction. 

 COMMON MISTAKES IN RESTFUL API DESIGN (14 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Common mistakes in RESTful API design include inside-out thinking,
improper URI definition, misuse of HTTP methods, bad error handling,
lack of versioning, and overcomplicated responses. 

 HOW TO GET DEEP TRACES IN YOUR NODE.JS BACKEND WITH OTEL AND DENO (8
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The new version of Deno allows immediate access to logs and traces
without additional instrumentation by using the `--unstable-otel`
flag, which adds OTel to Node.js easily. 

 SELF GAP (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Customizing gaps between specific flex or grid items is not flexible
enough - current workarounds include adjusting margins or wrapping
elements.
