ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW PINTEREST OPTIMIZED VIDEO PLAYBACK (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pinterest optimized video playback by embedding video manifest files
directly into their API responses, removing the extra network requests
needed to initiate playback. This reduced startup latency, as the
video player could immediately access the necessary metadata. To fix
the increased API response time caused by this change, Pinterest
implemented a MemCache layer to cache frequently accessed manifest
files, which led to a 36.7% reduction in startup latency on iOS. 

 PARSING JSON IN 500 LINES OF RUST (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A JSON parser built in 500 lines of Rust is able to convert JSON text
into a Rust enum representing the JSON structure and handle various
data types and errors. Performance testing revealed speeds comparable
to other parsers. Surprisingly, the parser has a performance boost
when run with sudo.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MY LLM CODEGEN WORKFLOW ATM (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This developer uses LLMs in three steps: brainstorming a detailed
specification, creating a plan broken down into small, testable steps,
and executing the plan using an LLM code generation tool like Claude
or Aider. For existing codebases, he uses tools like Repomix to
provide context to the LLM for tasks such as code review and test
generation. 

 WE SWITCHED FROM JAVA TO GO AND DON'T REGRET IT (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Glasskube, creators of a Kubernetes package manager, announced the
release of their open-source software distribution platform, Distr, on
GitHub. The company switched from Java to Go for Distr, because it has
much faster startup times (milliseconds vs. seconds) and lighter
resource consumption. 

 THOUGHTS ON DAYLIGHT COMPUTER (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Daylight Computer (DC-1) is a grayscale tablet designed for
outdoor use, with sunlight readability and nighttime amber backlight.
The main pro of the DC-1's design is that it leads to a better
relationship with technology and the outdoors.

 A YEAR OF UV: PROS, CONS, AND SHOULD YOU MIGRATE (24 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 "uv” is a Python project management tool. uv's strengths are in its
streamlined Python installation process across different operating
systems, its dependency management, and its ease of use. After using
it for a year, this developer believes that “uv” is the best tool
to use for every Python project if possible. 

 A NEW INTERPRETER IN PYTHON 3.14 DELIVERS A FREE SPEED BOOST (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Python 3.14 will include a new interpreter offering up to a 30%
performance increase for existing code without requiring any code
changes, with a beta release expected in May 2025. This is going to
happen by an optimization that the C compiler performs on CPython
code, which speeds up the way the interpreter dispatches its bytecode
instructions.
