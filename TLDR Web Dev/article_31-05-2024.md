 CATCH PERFORMANCE REGRESSIONS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN WITH SPEEDCURVE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your site was super fast when you built it ‚Äì but now it's 6 months
later, and that thing feels slower than a 4-hour Scorcese movie.

Next time, use SpeedCurve.

Their regression monitoring platform was created by a team of web
performance pioneers [5] to help you catch performance regressions
_before_ they happen.

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:

 	* Create performance budgets [6] by setting thresholds for metrics
you care about, like Core Web Vitals
 	* Integrate SpeedCurve with your CI/CD process to send you alerts or
even break the build [7] when the performance budget is violated
 	* Get all the diagnostics [8] you need to find and fix the problems,
when there's an issue

Check out their free trial [9] ‚Äì and see why developers at Airbnb,
Shopify, and many more really love it [10].

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DON'T DRY YOUR CODE PREMATURELY (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle can be harmful if applied
prematurely. Early abstractions can lead to unnecessary complexity
where future requirements may require independent evolution of
seemingly similar looking pieces of code. Instead of blindly following
DRY, developers should always think through what code sections are
truly redundant or may evolve in the future based on business
requirements. 

 HOW WE USED ESBUILD TO REDUCE OUR BROWSER EXTENSION BUILD TIMES BY
90% (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 1Password's browser extension build system, which was over half a
decade old, had become slow and inefficient. The team integrated
esbuild into the production build system, which achieved a 90%
reduction in build times.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE DECLINE OF THE USER INTERFACE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 UI and UX over time have gotten worse. For example, current web
interfaces often lack basic functionalities like "Ok" and "Cancel"
buttons, require overly precise mouse movements, and lack clear visual
cues for active elements or application identification. 

 UNEXPECTED ANTI-PATTERNS FOR ENGINEERING LEADERS ‚Äî LESSONS FROM
STRIPE, UBER & CARTA (32 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article challenges three common engineering leadership
anti-patterns. First, it argues against always avoiding
micromanagement, suggesting that leaders should engage in "conflict
mining" to understand context and write down the details of company
strategies. Second, it advocates for measuring imperfect but useful
metrics over waiting for perfect ones. Lastly, it challenges the idea
of managers as umbrellas, suggesting that exposing teams to the "gory
details" and providing less buffered information is probably better in
the long run. 

 WHY, AFTER 6 YEARS, I'M OVER GRAPHQL (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 After initially being a GraphQL advocate, this developer now advises
against its use due to several issues he encountered. These include
increased attack surface due to query language exposure, difficulties
in implementing effective rate limiting, challenges with query parsing
and server overload, performance issues like N+1 problems and data
authorization inefficiencies, and the overall complexity of
maintaining a GraphQL codebase.

MISCELLANEOUS

 UNDERSTANDING THE COST OF GENERATIVE AI MODELS IN PRODUCTION (4
MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Deploying Generative AI models is expensive just beyond raw compute.
Developers also need to be mindful of the costs of container services,
networking, load balancing, autoscaling, logging, and continuous
integration. Sometimes, managed services might be cheaper than
self-hosted solutions even if raw compute costs are higher initially. 

 AI OVERVIEWS: ABOUT LAST WEEK (4 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Google recently launched AI Overviews, an AI-powered search feature
designed to help users with complex queries. Odd and erroneous
overviews were reported on social media, some of which were faked.
Google explained that AI Overviews, unlike chatbots, are integrated
with the company's core web ranking systems and prioritize accuracy by
linking to reputable sources. The odd results stemmed from
misinterpretations of nonsensical queries, satirical content, and
user-generated content, as well as data voids. Google has now made
improvements to detect these issues.
