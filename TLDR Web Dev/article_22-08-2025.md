ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 AN INTERACTIVE GUIDE TO SVG PATHS (23 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This is an interactive guide to SVG paths, focusing on the path
element and its various commands for drawing shapes. It covers basic
commands like Move and Line, then goes into Bézier curves (quadratic
and cubic) and the complex Arc command, explaining each parameter with
interactive examples. The guide also covers extra details like closing
paths, relative commands, and chained curves. 

 CREATIVE WAYS TO FUND OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Open source projects are often underfunded, leading to maintainer
burnout, but innovative revenue models are starting to show up. The
Wix Toolset uses an "Open Source Maintenance Fee," which charges users
for issue reporting and pull requests based on company size, providing
income for maintainers. Another example is Astral's uv package
manager, which offers a free version and a paid, enterprise-focused
registry called pyx with more features. 

 YOU SHOULD ADD DEBUG VIEWS TO YOUR DB (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Creating debug views in your database can simplify complex queries
and improve debugging efficiency. These views predefine joins and
include relevant information, making it easier to find specific data
based on various criteria. By making these views, it removes the need
to repeatedly write lengthy queries.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AWS CEO SAYS USING AI TO REPLACE JUNIOR STAFF IS 'DUMBEST THING I'VE
EVER HEARD' (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AWS CEO Matt Garman dismissed the idea of replacing junior staff with
AI as the dumbest thing he's ever heard, arguing that these employees
are inexpensive and AI-savvy. Instead, it's important to continue to
hire and train junior developers to create a future workforce with
critical thinking and problem-solving skills. 

 THE UNBEARABLE SLOWNESS OF AI CODING (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When first coding with Claude Code, this dev had a speed boost in his
coding tasks. However, as his app grew, the review and debugging
process became painstakingly slow, despite using multiple instances of
Claude Code simultaneously. He found himself spending a lot of time as
a QA engineer, fixing issues generated by Claude, including
hallucinations about library features. 

 BUILDING AI PRODUCTS IN THE PROBABILISTIC ERA (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The industry is experiencing a shift from deterministic software,
where inputs predictably map to outputs, to a probabilistic era driven
by AI. Traditional methods of building and managing software based on
pre-defined features and measurable funnels are becoming obsolete as
AI models exhibit emergent, unpredictable behaviors. To succeed,
companies must adopt an empirical, scientific approach, focusing on
managing uncertainty and understanding user behavior through user
trajectories. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SIM (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Sim is an open-source platform for building and deploying AI agent
workflows. It supports local AI models using Ollama. 

 EXPO SDK V54 BETA (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Expo SDK 54 beta is now available, with React Native 0.81, React
19.1.0, and new features like iOS 26 Liquid Glass icons. A big
improvement is precompiled React Native for iOS, reducing build times
by a lot. This release also targets Android 16, enabling edge-to-edge
display by default and introducing predictive back gestures.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MY AI HAD ALREADY FIXED THE CODE BEFORE I SAW IT (16 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Compounding engineering is a development approach where AI tools
learn from every code review, bug fix, and pull request, building
systems that improve themselves. By codifying preferences and
architectural decisions, engineers can train AI agents like Claude to
automate tasks and enforce consistent standards. This method turns
production errors into permanent fixes. 

 GOOGLE SCORES SIX-YEAR META CLOUD DEAL WORTH OVER $10 BILLION (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google has secured a big six-year cloud contract with Meta worth over
$10 billion. Meta has usually been reliant on Amazon Web Services and
Microsoft Azure, but is expanding its cloud infrastructure to support
its growing artificial intelligence workloads. 

 GPT-5: IT JUST DOES STUFF (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GPT-5 automatically selects the right model for each task and
proactively suggests solutions rather than just answering questions.
It's possible to give it a vague coding prompt and receive a fully
functional app with features never requested. This shows a shift in AI
becoming more proactive over time.
