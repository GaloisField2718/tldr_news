 THE BIGGEST-EVER GLOBAL OUTAGE: LESSONS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS (26
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 CrowdStrike caused a global outage by pushing a faulty configuration
update to its Falcon product, resulting in the crash of 8.5 million
Windows machines. The update aimed to enhance threat detection but
contained a logic error that caused the CSAgent.sys process to crash
the operating system. The recovery process was slow and manual,
requiring physical access to each impacted machine. While CrowdStrike
is primarily responsible, Microsoft's inability to restrict
third-party software from running at kernel level due to a 2009
agreement with the European Commission also worsened the situation. 

 HOW CANVA COLLECTS 25 BILLION EVENTS PER DAY (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Canva's product analytics pipeline collects 25 billion events per day
with high uptime, using Protobuf to define event schemas and Datumgen
to generate code and enforce compatibility rules. The event collection
process starts with analytics clients on various platforms, then
events are validated and enriched in ingest-workers before being sent
to a Kinesis Data Stream (KDS). KDS serves as the primary streaming
platform, with SQS as a fallback for overflow protection and failover
mode. 

 RUBY METHODS ARE COLORLESS (26 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ruby methods are "colorless," meaning there's no distinction between
synchronous and asynchronous methods, allowing for asynchronous
behavior without explicit markers. Ruby achieves this through
independent call stacks, enabled by Threads and Fibers, which allow
for switching between tasks without blocking the main thread. This
concurrency model, similar to Go's, allows for efficient handling of
blocking operations like file reading, HTTP calls, and database
queries.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SOFTWARE ENGINEERS ARE NOT (AND SHOULD NOT BE) TECHNICIANS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A good software engineer should automate repetitive tasks, which is
not incentivized in most large tech companies. These companies tend to
favor predictability and hire technicians who do well-understood work
instead of engineers who tackle unpredictable challenges. This focus
on predictability leads to over-hiring and reduced productivity. 

 I'VE USED (AND LOVED) RUST FOR ~10 YEARS. HERE ARE THE WAYS IT
DISAPPOINTS ME (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This author loves Rust, but finds some of the syntax cumbersome,
especially for library and application code. The orphan rule and the
flexibility of the module system can make organizing code difficult.
Compile times and IDE tooling are also slow, particularly for large
projects. 

 HOW TO USE PERPLEXITY IN YOUR DAILY WORKFLOW (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Perplexity is useful thanks to its ability to choose between
different AI models and a Pro Search function that asks clarifying
questions. It can be integrated into daily workflows for tasks like
morning briefings, fact-checking, brainstorming, and writing
assistance.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GLHF CHAT (WEBSITE) [10] 

 GLHF Chat allows you to chat with any open-source large language
model. You can use the chat UI or an OpenAI-compatible API. 

 POKU (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Poku is a JavaScript test runner that aims to bring back the
simplicity of JavaScript testing. It has high performance, a low
memory footprint, and the ability to run tests across different
platforms like Node.js, Bun, and Deno. 

 BRIEFER NOTEBOOKS (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Notebooks that live on the cloud. They support SQL and Python. An AI
assistant is included. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPEN SOURCE AI IS THE PATH FORWARD (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Mark Zuckerberg believes open source AI is the best way to develop AI
technology for several reasons: it allows developers to customize
models to their needs, avoids vendor lock-in, protects sensitive data,
and is more cost-effective. Zuckerberg also believes that open source
AI is safer and more secure because it allows for wider scrutiny and
transparency. 

 FORGET ‚ÄúSHOW, DON'T TELL‚Äù. ENGAGE, DON'T SHOW! (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Good UIs and knowledge transfer should have a smooth curve of
incremental effort leading to incremental value. People learning
should understand why the information is useful and apply it quickly
in order to truly retain and understand it. Explaining things in
context, rather than upfront, is the most effective.

QUICK LINKS

 ASK HN: FAST DATA STRUCTURES FOR DISJOINT INTERVALS? (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [15] 

 This author asks for recommendations on fast data structures for
disjoint intervals and a commenter suggests using a custom btree that
understands ranges instead of singular keys. 

 TYPES AS INTERFACES (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Types can be used as interfaces in Haskell, but since they're not
composable, devs can use typeclasses. 

 DEMYSTIFYING COOKIES AND TOKENS (22 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Cookies are small text files stored in your browser used for session
management, personalization, and tracking, while tokens are
self-contained JSON objects used for secure data exchange between
applications and services. 

 SQLITE-JIFF (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 A date-time SQLite extension based on the jiff library that will
support timezones, complex durations, and daylight savings
calculations.
