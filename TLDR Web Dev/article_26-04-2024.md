ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 NO ABSTRACTIONS: AN INCREASE API DESIGN PRINCIPLE (5 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Increase has a ‚Äúno abstractions‚Äù principle when designing APIs.
This means using real-world naming conventions from underlying
networks, modeling resources after immutable real-world events, and
separating resources with distinct use cases. The approach may seem
more complex at first, but it actually makes the API more predictable,
more consistent, and reduces cognitive load for developers. 

 HOW ROBINHOOD USES GRAPH ALGORITHMS TO PREVENT FRAUD (8 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Robinhood uses graphs to represent relationships between user
accounts. To combat fraud, it uses vertex-centric algorithms (BFS,
DFS) for targeted exploration and graph-centric algorithms (Connected
Components, PageRank) for broader network analysis. The company uses
graph databases to store and query graph-structured data with built-in
analytics. 

 TYPESCRIPT: BRANDED TYPES üîß (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 TypeScript's structural typing can make it difficult to differentiate
between types with identical structures. To solve this, this article
introduces the concept of "branding," which adds a unique symbolic
identifier to a type. It shows real-world examples of a ‚ÄúBrand‚Äù
type and relevant methods like AddBrand and RemoveBrand.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MOST TECH JOBS ARE JOKES AND I AM NOT LAUGHING (27 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While recruiting for a tech job, this author went through a lot of
negative interviewing experiences and found that interviewers often
focused on superficial factors during interviews. They also found it
hard to find a ‚Äúgood‚Äù work environment with talented colleagues,
minimal bureaucracy, and meaningful work. Still, the author tells
readers to not settle for a mediocre job and to try their best to
prioritize passion and meaning in their work. 

 WHAT'S YOUR ONBOARDING LIKE? (REDDIT THREAD) [9] 

 The dev onboarding process at companies varies a lot, but a good
onboarding process allows new devs to build relationships across the
team, improve the team's documentation, and get up to speed quickly. A
popular comment on this Reddit thread emphasizes the importance of
giving a new hire a tiny bug or feature that allows them to push to
prod within the first week. This allows them to build momentum and
confidence within the team's codebase.

MISCELLANEOUS

 F.C.C. VOTES TO RESTORE NET NEUTRALITY RULES (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The FCC has voted to reinstate net neutrality regulations, which
means that broadband providers cannot block or slow down access to
their competitors' services. While broadband providers are expected to
take legal action to overturn these reinstated rules, this ruling
stands to make the internet more open by not allowing providers to
play favorites with internet traffic. 

 AN ENGINEER'S GUIDE TO TALKING TO USERS (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 When engineers talk to users, they get the rich context that they may
miss by relying solely on filtered information from others, like
product managers. The best users to talk to are power users and those
frequently contacting support teams. Engineers should focus on two
areas when asking questions: problem exploration (to guide future
product direction) and solution validation (to assess new features or
demos). 

 PIET (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Piet is a programming language where programs are represented by
abstract paintings. The language uses 20 colors with commands
determined by the color changes encountered as an interpreter travels
through an image. The program manipulates data using a stack and
includes commands for arithmetic, logic, stack operations, and
input/output.
