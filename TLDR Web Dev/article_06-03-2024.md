ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REACT 19: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IN ONE PLACE (6 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 React 19 introduces several significant improvements designed to
streamline development and boost application performance. Key features
include a performance-enhancing compiler, simplified form handling
with Actions, server-side rendering optimizations with Server
Components, and better integration with Web Components. The update
promises faster rendering, smoother user experiences, and easier
development workflows. 

 MAKING SVG LOADING SPINNERS: AN INTERACTIVE GUIDE (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 SVG spinners are simple to create and offer a visually appealing way
to indicate loading progress. This guide demonstrates how to build
basic spinners using SVG's circle element and attributes like
stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset. To make the spinners dynamic,
CSS animations are used to rotate the circle or animate the stroke
attributes.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FEATURE FLAGS ARE RUINING YOUR CODEBASE (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Feature flags are a valuable tool for separating code deployment from
feature releases, but their overuse can complicate codebases and
hinder testing. Too many feature flags leads to difficult testing and
complex code and creates excuses for PMs to not make hard decisions
like completely removing a feature. To deal with this, you should
separate your feature flags into categories and deal with them
differently: release toggles for merging not-ready code into
production, ops toggles for features with unknown performance
implications, experiment toggles for A/B tests, and permission toggles
to enable different experiences for different users. Only let PMs
manage the latter two and let developers remove control release and
ops toggles as soon as they're done. 

 MODERN GIT COMMANDS AND FEATURES YOU SHOULD BE USING (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Most people stick to basic Git commands. This article discusses less
common but powerful Git commands. One useful command is git switch,
which offers safer, more focused branch switching compared to git
checkout. Another is git restore, which simplifies file restoration
and replaces some uses of git reset and git checkout. For large
monorepos, git sparse-checkout improves performance by checking out
only specific directories. git worktree enables working on multiple
branches simultaneously, removing the need for stashes or multiple
repo clones. 

 THE "MISSING" GRAPH DATATYPE ALREADY EXISTS. IT WAS INVENTED IN THE
'70S (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Programming languages lack built-in graph support not because graphs
are too complex, but because modern languages' imperative model makes
it difficult to write graph algorithms without committing to a
specific graph representation. A declarative language like Datalog,
based on relational algebra, is a much more natural fit for expressing
graph algorithms. Datalog's ability to optimize queries based on
dataset characteristics and its expressiveness makes it both
performant and easy to use for graph-related tasks.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY TECH JOB INTERVIEWS BECAME SUCH A NIGHTMARE (6 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 The recent wave of tech layoffs has shifted power back to employers,
leading to more demanding hiring processes with lengthy assignments
and aggressive negotiation tactics. Job seekers are frustrated with
excessive interview requirements and disrespectful treatment from some
companies. Experts warn that these laborious hiring practices could
backfire, especially once the market shifts. 

 ARRAY LANGUAGES VS. THE CURSE OF THE SPREADSHEET (10 MINUTE READ)
[22] 

 Spreadsheets are widely used for data entry, computation, and
presentation, but their design makes them prone to hidden errors and
difficult to manage as complexity grows. This presents an opportunity
for array programming languages, which offer a more reliable and
expressive way to perform complex calculations. The Kap array
programming language aims to bridge the gap between spreadsheets and
traditional programming, providing a familiar spreadsheet-like
interface for data entry and presentation while using an actual
programming language for computation. 

 CRACKING META‚ÄôS MESSENGER CERTIFICATE PINNING ON MACOS (4 MINUTE
READ) [23] 

 Meta's Messenger app for macOS uses certificate pinning to prevent
users from easily analyzing network requests sent to Meta's servers.
Using the Hopper disassembler, this author identifies a key function
(IsUsingSandbox()) that controls certificate pinning behavior. By
modifying a few bytes within the Messenger binary to force this
function to return "true", the author is able to effectively disable
certificate pinning and successfully intercept network traffic for
analysis.
