 BUCKET: FEATURE FLAGGING FOR B2B WITH REALTIME CUSTOMER FEEDBACK
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Will that new feature you've been working on make a difference?

Or will users not get it?

De-risk your releases with Bucket [4] - the better way for B2B product
teams to release features.

 	* Increase iteration velocity and customer satisfaction with feature
flagging + built-in feedback and adoption metrics [4].
 	* Gradually roll out features with powerful company-level targeting
rules. Instantly roll back releases that go wrong.
 	* Get ready-to-use feature engagement metrics and qualitative
feedback for every feature as soon as you release.

It's feature flagging, feedback, and analysis ‚Äî all from a single
code snippet. Create your free account now. [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DEBUGGING TILL DAWN: HOW GIT BISECT SAVED MY DEMO (3 MINUTE READ) [5]


 This developer was debugging late at night because a critical bug
emerged in their project just hours before a crucial demo. Faced with
over 100 commits to sift through, they used git bisect, which uses
binary search, to find the commit that introduced the bug. They saved
themselves hours of pain by knowing that git bisect exists and also
knowing how to use git bisect properly. 

 SQLITE ON RAILS: THE HOW AND WHY OF OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE (19 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 SQLite out-of-the-box on Rails isn't production ready. It needs some
performance improvements with the help of some Ruby gems (packages)
that enable immediate transactions, manage write query queues, and
release the Global VM lock while queries wait for database responses.
SQLite should be used in the write-ahead-log (WAL) mode and should
have separate connection pools for reading and writing operations.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY COPILOT IS MAKING PROGRAMMERS WORSE AT PROGRAMMING (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 AI tools like GitHub Copilot are making programmers worse at
programming. These tools can erode fundamental programming skills and
create a false sense of expertise. Relying on them without a deep
understanding of the code and the ability to problem-solve
independently will make developers dependent on AI. 

 WHY NOT COMMENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Comments that explain why a certain approach wasn't taken in the code
are valuable. While identifiers can describe "what" the code does,
they cannot always properly convey the reasoning behind choosing a
less optimal but simpler solution. 

 WHY SOME OF US LIKE "INTERDIFF" CODE REVIEW (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Traditional code review systems, like GitHub, suffer from a "diff
soup" problem, where multiple commits are crammed together and
reviewed as a single diff. This makes it difficult to follow the
evolution of code changes and leads to issues with blaming, bisecting,
and incremental review. An "interdiff" approach, where revisions of
the original commits are published instead of new commits, lets
reviewers see incremental changes and lets authors avoid cluttering
history with "fix review" commits.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ‚úÇÔ∏è CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES (SPONSOR) [10] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it ‚Äî you need to check out QA
Wolf.

QA Wolf [10] gets engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test
coverage [10] and helps them ship 2x faster by reducing QA cycles from
hours to minutes.

The result? With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [11] achieved
4x more test cases and 86% faster QA cycles.
