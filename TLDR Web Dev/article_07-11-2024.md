ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 TWO WAYS TO THE TWO REACTS (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This article goes over two approaches to building React apps: Next.js
App Router, which prioritizes server-side rendering and data
management, and TanStack Start, which has a client-centric focus while
offering server-side capabilities as an extension. Next.js App Router
advocates for a unidirectional flow of data from server to client,
while TanStack Start has an incremental approach that allows
developers to gradually integrate server-side features into their
existing client-focused React apps. 

 EXPLORING THE BROWSER RENDERING PROCESS (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 After typing a URL into a browser, a DNS lookup translates the domain
name into an IP address, followed by a TCP handshake to establish a
connection and potentially a TLS handshake for secure communication.
Once connected, an HTTP request is sent for the website's content, and
the browser begins parsing the HTML response. This involves
tokenization to identify HTML elements, building the DOM tree to
represent the structure, and creating the CSSOM tree for styling. The
browser then combines these into the Render Tree to determine the
visual layout, and the painting phase renders the visual
representation on the screen based on the Render Tree and associated
styles. 

 HOW WEBSOCKETS COST US $1M ON OUR AWS BILL (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Recall.ai discovered its AWS bill was inflated by $1 million annually
due to inefficiently using WebSockets for inter-process communication.
It was transferring large volumes of video data through WebSockets,
causing significant CPU overhead due to fragmentation and masking in
the WebSocket protocol. To address this, Recall.ai opted for shared
memory with a custom ringbuffer implementation, which reduced its CPU
usage by up to 50%.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DON'T RETURN NAMED TUPLES IN NEW APIS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Using named tuples for new APIs is discouraged due to their
complexity. While they might seem simple to define, they introduce
dual access methods (index-based and attribute-based) that increase
complexity and also allow for potentially unwanted operations like
slicing and iteration. 

 MONOREPO - OUR EXPERIENCE (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A platform called Ente transitioned from a multi-repository setup to
a monorepo. As a result, the team had a reduction in grunt work, as
multiple changes across different projects now required only one pull
request. Also, the unified repository has boosted the platform's
open-source visibility.

 WHY THE DEEP LEARNING BOOM CAUGHT ALMOST EVERYONE BY SURPRISE (21
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The surprising rise of deep learning was thanks to three visionaries:
Geoffrey Hinton, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Fei-Fei Li. While
Hinton's work on backpropagation laid the groundwork for efficient
deep neural network training, it was Huang's CUDA platform that
enabled the necessary parallel processing power. Li's ImageNet dataset
provided the large amount of data required to train these models. 

 WHY COMPANIES ARE DITCHING THE CLOUD: THE RISE OF CLOUD REPATRIATION
(6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Companies are increasingly moving workloads back from public clouds
to on-prem or private cloud environments. This shift is driven by
concerns about rising cloud costs, vendor lock-in, and the limitations
of cloud-based solutions for certain workloads. 

 LINUX BUILT-IN TOOLS ARE SO POWERFUL, YOU CAN BUILD A DATABASE WITH
THEM. HERE'S HOW (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Linux offers an alternative to traditional SQL databases with its
text-based command-line tools. This approach allows devs to build
simple databases using plain text files and commands like grep, cut,
awk, sort, head, tail, and join. Combined, these tools can perform
operations like selecting columns, filtering rows, sorting data, and
joining tables.
