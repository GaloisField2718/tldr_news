ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 ALL THE DATA CAN BE YOURS (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This post goes over various methods for discovering and utilizing
undocumented APIs to reverse-engineer web apps. These techniques range
from searching GitHub for public code and analyzing fetch requests and
robots.txt files to leveraging Google's cached errors and guessing API
endpoints based on patterns. 

 OPTIMIZING A WEBGPU MATMUL KERNEL FOR 1TFLOP+ PERFORMANCE (15 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 This article discusses the optimization of a WebGPU matrix
multiplication kernel that achieved over 1 TFLOPS performance. It
explores each stage of the kernel optimization, starting with a naive
implementation and progressing through increasing thread count, 2D
workgroups, kernel tiling, and loop unrolling. Through these
optimizations, the kernel achieved a performance improvement
approaching the theoretical peak of the Apple M2 Pro chip.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO SHIP PROJECTS AT TECH COMPANIES (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Shipping projects in big tech companies requires a unique skillset
that goes beyond just writing code. The most important aspect of
shipping is gaining the trust and approval of company leadership,
which means understanding their expectations, communicating well, and
proactively addressing potential problems. 

 SECURITY IS A USELESS CONTROLS PROBLEM (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Many security controls are useless because they lack clear,
understandable explanations. These controls often arise from
compliance requirements or security "best practices" that don't
consider their actual value. 

 ARE AI ASSISTANTS MAKING US WORSE PROGRAMMERS? (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While AI can help with repetitive tasks and code generation,
over-reliance can lead to a deterioration of fundamental skills. AI
assistants are most beneficial for handling implementation details and
tedious aspects of coding so that devs can focus on problem-solving,
design, and strategic thinking.

 INSIDE THE $20 MILLION BUSINESS OF GUTTING FAILED BAY AREA TECH
COMPANIES (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Better Source is a $20 million business that specializes in
liquidating office furniture from failed Bay Area tech companies. The
company has witnessed the rise and fall of numerous tech giants. Its
business has boomed in recent years because of the shift to remote
work and the changing demands for office spaces. 

 THE DEATH AND LIFE OF PREDICTION MARKETS AT GOOGLE (23 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Google has experimented with two internal prediction markets, Prophit
and Gleangen. Prophit, launched in 2005, was initially popular but
ultimately failed to launch publicly due to legal challenges and a
shifting regulatory landscape. Gleangen, launched in 2020, has been
much more successful internally, with a larger user base and more
consistent use, but faces ongoing challenges in proving its value to
Google management. 

 REVERSE ENGINEERING: FINDING EXPLOITS IN VIDEO GAMES (7 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 You can reverse engineer game data by extracting and decrypting files
and scripts to find exploits in video games. You can also analyze
network traffic using tools like AssetsTools.NET, Fiddler, and
Wireshark. By analyzing the game's authentication flow, packet
structures, and opcodes, you can identify vulnerabilities and test for
potential exploits.
