 REBUILDING NETFLIX VIDEO PROCESSING PIPELINE WITH MICROSERVICES (9
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Netflix's video pipeline has transformed from Standard Dynamic Range
(SDR) to 4K and High Dynamic Range (HDR) support, increasing its
efficiency needs. The Netflix team transitioned the pipeline from a
monolithic platform to a microservices-based one called Cosmos. Cosmos
allows Netflix to deliver features faster. The team breaks down in
this blog post how exactly they determined service boundaries while
breaking up monoliths into microservices. 

 DO WE THINK OF GIT COMMITS AS DIFFS, SNAPSHOTS, AND/OR HISTORIES? (9
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Most people have varied perspectives on git commits, with roughly
equal numbers thinking of commits as either diffs or snapshots based
on a poll. Git internally represents Git commits as snapshots and uses
packfiles to store snapshots efficiently. However, no mental model is
‚Äúwrong‚Äù as long as it provides a solid intuition for everyday Git
usage.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY INFLUENCE WITHOUT AUTHORITY IS A VITAL SKILL FOR ANYONE (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Having positional authority alone is not enough to make people comply
willingly. Influence is necessary to get things done, whether at the
team level or organization level. It is required for turning ideas
into reality, finding larger scope, and aspiring to senior management
or C-suite roles. 

 THE TWO REACTS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article discusses the dilemma of whether React components should
run on users' computers or on servers. Components requiring instant
interactivity, like a counter, should run on the client (user's
computer) to provide a smooth user experience. On the other hand,
components that rely on server-side data should run on the server. The
article poses questions about how to split components across different
environments while preserving React's advantages so you can make the
best decisions for your application.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TIDY FIRST? (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The book ‚ÄúTidy First?‚Äù introduces the concept of "tidyings,"
which are small refactorings that don't change program behavior, but
make it easier to implement behavioral changes. It‚Äôs important to
structurally prepare code before implementing behavioral changes. A
balance must be struck between the time value of money and optionality
in software, highlighting the need to create a structure that supports
quick changes. 

 INSIDE REWIND‚ÄôS PATH TO 170 SERIES A OFFERS (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI startup Rewind initially started as a meeting recording and
transcription product and eventually pivoted towards enhancing human
memory using AI technology. It achieved viral success by looking at
both qualitative data during manual onboarding and quantitative data
around product usage to figure out how to pivot correctly. To generate
hype around its launch, it told a great story around its product, was
transparent in its mission, and created a memorable demo.
