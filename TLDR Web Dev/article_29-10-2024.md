ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 USING RUST IN NON-RUST SERVERS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE (17 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 There are various ways to integrate Rust into non-Rust (i.e. Node.js)
servers to improve performance. This article presents four tiers of
Rust integration: Tier 1 uses a Rust CLI tool, Tier 2 uses a Rust Wasm
module, Tier 3 uses a Rust native function, and Tier 4 involves a
complete Rust rewrite of a server. Using a Rust native function (Tier
3) offers the best balance of performance gains and ease of
implementation, while rewriting an entire server in Rust (Tier 4)
achieves the highest performance (but is often impractical). 

 HTML FORM VALIDATION IS HEAVILY UNDERUSED (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 HTML forms have powerful validation mechanisms, but they aren't used
much because the setCustomValidity API is cumbersome to use. A better
way to make it easier to use is to use a declarative custom-validity
attribute, which lets developers define input validations within their
components. 

 ANGULAR'S APPROACH TO PARTIAL HYDRATION (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Angular's approach to partial hydration ("incremental hydration‚Äù)
involves deferring the hydration of certain sections, typically those
not immediately visible or interactive, until needed. Angular uses
deferrable views, event replay, and defer blocks to achieve this.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WRITE CODE THAT IS EASY TO DELETE, NOT EASY TO EXTEND. (18 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 It's better to have a mindset of writing code that is easy to delete.
To do this, you can start by copying and pasting code to avoid
unnecessary dependencies, then progressively layer and modularize code
to isolate complex or changeable parts. The end goal is to create code
that can easily adapt to change and iteration. 

 WHAT YOU WORK ON >> HOW HARD YOU WORK (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 What you work on is more important than how hard you work. It's
better to focus on high-impact projects that align with both
organizational goals and career advancement and say no to low-priority
work by clearly communicating your reasoning. 

 ON THE WEB, AND OPTIMISM (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This author reflects on the shift from optimistic to more realistic
views of the web's potential. He critiques techno-optimism,
highlighting the web's vulnerabilities to disinformation and
manipulation and the concentration of power in a few tech giants. The
author remains hopeful, drawing inspiration from the web's
decentralized origins and the potential for new technologies like the
Fediverse and Interledger to create a more equitable and open
internet. Ultimately, he acknowledges the possibility that his
optimism may prove naive, but emphasizes the importance of learning
from past mistakes and building a better web for the future.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LEARN HOW TO BUILD A FULL STACK APPLICATION USING REACT NATIVE & EXPO
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Build a cross-platform full-stack React Native application using a
single codebase with scalable, real-time backend support,
authentication, and user management. 

 TRENCH (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Trench is an open-source, real-time event tracking system built on
Apache Kafka and Clickhouse. It offers GDPR-compliant analytics and
scalable deployment options for self-hosting or a fully managed cloud
solution. 

 RADIX VUE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Radix Vue is an open-source, accessibility-focused UI component
library for Vue.js that ports the Radix UI primitives. 

 OUTLINES (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Outlines is a library for structured text generation. It has features
like multiple choices, type constraints, regex-structured generation,
efficient JSON generation, and the ability to use context-free
grammars to guide generation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WE'RE FORKING FLUTTER. THIS IS WHY (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Flock is a new fork of Flutter created due to the Flutter team's
limited labor and slow response times. Flutter's open-source nature
and large developer base make it possible for external contributors to
improve the framework faster than the Flutter team themselves. 

 INVESTIGATION OF A WORKBENCH UI LATENCY ISSUE (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Netflix engineers investigated a latency issue affecting JupyterLab
UI on their Workbench platform. They started with identifying the
"bad" notebook and ruling out potential culprits like the pystan
library and network issues. The root cause was traced to the
jupyter_resource_usage extension, which was causing CPU contention by
recursively querying all child processes, resulting in excessive
memory usage and slow parsing of a file. 

 DEBUGGING AUDIO ARTIFACTS CAUSED BY... A SERIAL PORT? (6 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 A company that processes millions of video call meetings per month
migrated its cluster from Kubernetes to a self-built system. After the
migration, customers reported popping noises in captured audio,
despite no changes to the application code. The issue was traced back
to the cloud-init logging system, which writes to a virtual serial
device. The system received too much data from the audio encoding
process and became overwhelmed, causing the audio processing to
experience CPU starvation and leading to the popping noises.

(26 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Apple announced a new iMac with the powerful M4 chip and Apple
Intelligence, improved performance, a nano-texture display option, a
12MP Center Stage camera, Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, and more. 

 I HUMBLY SUBMIT AN OPTION FOR THE NEW 'CLICK TO CANCEL' LAW (REDDIT
POST) [19] 

 A funny rendition of an impossible ‚Äúclick to cancel‚Äù
implementation.

OFT-UNSTATED FOSS-RELATED FREEDOMS (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 "Free software" users and developers have the freedom to engage or
disengage with software in any way they choose, including criticizing
