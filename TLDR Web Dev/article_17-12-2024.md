ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 IN SEARCH OF A FASTER SQLITE (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Researchers from the University of Helsinki and Cambridge developed
Limbo, a Rust-based rewrite of SQLite. Their approach uses
asynchronous I/O using io_uring, eliminating the blocking behavior of
traditional SQLite's synchronous I/O calls. This, coupled with storage
disaggregation, reduces tail latency (up to 100x improvement at p999),
leading to more efficient concurrency in multi-tenant serverless
environments. 

 REACT, VISUALIZED (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article provides a visualized walkthrough to React, explaining
its historical context by contrasting it with jQuery, Backbone.js, and
AngularJS. React's core innovation is representing the view as a
function of the application's state (v = f(s)), implemented through a
component-based API that uses JSX for combining HTML and JavaScript.
The article details key concepts like managing props (data passed
between components), state (data within components), rendering
(updating the UI based on state changes), and effects (managing side
effects) along with advanced topics like Context and refs. 

 YOU MIGHT NOT NEED A REACT FORM LIBRARY (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 React developers often unnecessarily use form libraries. Basic forms
can be effectively managed without them until complexity increases.
This article shows an example of building a React form with
server-side validation using React Server Actions and Zod for schema
validation, including error handling and the creation of reusable
helper functions. Client-side validation is then added using native
HTML attributes and the Zod schema.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 NEW GRAD TO STAFF AT META IN 3 YEARS: EVAN KING (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A staff engineer at Meta got there in 3 years starting as a new grad.
He attributes his success to six key principles: prioritizing speed
and efficiency, operating beyond his current level, embracing
uncertainty and sharing ideas, focusing on practical solutions over
complex ones, building strong relationships, and maintaining a
positive attitude. 

 MEASURE WHAT MATTERS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Alert fatigue, with too many irrelevant alerts, can lead to engineers
ignoring the important ones. Engineers should instead prioritize
actionable alerts by focusing on metrics directly impacting users and
implementing Service Level Objectives (SLOs) tied to these key
metrics.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SURVEYJS: A FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE FORM BUILDER THAT FEELS LIKE AN
INTEGRAL PART OF YOUR APPLICATION (SPONSOR) [9] 

 SurveyJS is your go-to alternative to mainstream SaaS survey
platforms and expensive custom survey solutions. Customize absolutely
everything [9]—tabs, questions, properties, and even appearance—so
it looks like you built it yourself. Integrate with any backend to
retain full ownership of your data, export your forms as PDFs, build
survey data dashboards, and much more. Try out a free demo [10] 

 BOLT.DIY (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 bolt.diy is an open-source, AI-powered full-stack web development
tool that allows users to build applications in their browsers using
various LLMs. 

 BOA RELEASE V0.20 (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Boa is an ECMAScript engine written in Rust. Boa v0.20 improves
JavaScript engine conformance and adds features like Temporal API
support, Atomics.pause, and getters/setters in the js_class! macro. 

 GO PROTOBUF: THE NEW OPAQUE API (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Go programming language has released a new Opaque API for
Protocol Buffers, improving performance and memory efficiency by
hiding struct fields and using accessors while maintaining backwards
compatibility with the existing Open Struct API through a Hybrid API.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW NIGHTSHADE WORKS (13 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Nightshade is an algorithm that generates poisoned data to confuse AI
image generators. It improves upon simpler data poisoning methods by
creating images that are undetectable to humans yet highly effective
at altering AI training. The technique uses a perturbation process to
subtly change images, making them appear similar to the AI. 

 STATE OF NODE.JS PERFORMANCE 2024 (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Node.js versions 20 to 22 have various performance differences in key
modules like assert, buffers, fs, and streams. This report presents
benchmarks using dedicated hardware for accurate comparisons. The
results were evaluated through statistical analysis. The report
highlights big gains, such as faster buffer operations and
improvements to WebStreams, alongside some regressions, like slower
text decoding for certain encodings.

 ASK HN: SWES HOW DO YOU FUTURE-PROOF YOUR CAREER IN LIGHT OF LLMS?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [16] 

 This Hacker News discussion explores how software engineers can
future-proof their careers against LLMs, with some arguing that LLMs
will primarily affect junior and mid-level roles while others maintain
that expertise and problem-solving skills will remain the most
important. 

 THE SUBTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PUSHING DEVELOPERS TO START THEIR
ENGINE AND PUSHING THEM OFF A CLIFF (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 There are two approaches to motivating employees - pushing them to
take on new challenges versus respecting their autonomy - both of
which depend on identifying an employee's strengths and working
styles. 

 USEENCAPSULATION (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 To improve React code readability and maintainability, encapsulate
all React hook usage within custom hooks, which simplifies component
logic and enables easier refactoring. 

 KEEPING RAILS COOL: THE MODERN FRONTEND TOOLKIT (8 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This "silver toolbox" approach to Rails frontend development combines
Hotwire, Turbo Mount, and Inertia.js to optimize productivity for
startups.
