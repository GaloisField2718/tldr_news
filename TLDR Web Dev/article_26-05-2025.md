ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CONCURRENT RENDERING (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 React 18's concurrent rendering is an update that makes rendering
interruptible, allowing React to prepare multiple UI versions
simultaneously and prioritize urgent updates over non-urgent ones for
better responsiveness. This also includes updates to the
startTransition API, useTransition and useDeferredValue hooks, and
automatic batching to improve app performance during heavy rendering
tasks. 

 10 UPDATES FROM GOOGLE I/O 2025: CSS CAROUSELS, AI-POWERED DEVTOOLS,
PROMPT API WITH MULTIMODAL CAPABILITIES, AND MORE (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google I/O 2025 introduced 10 updates for web dev. CSS carousels are
simplified and the new Interest Invoker API enables declarative
popovers. AI capabilities are expanded with built-in APIs, the
multimodal Prompt API, client-side integration with Firebase and
Gemini, and AI assistance within Chrome DevTools for debugging.
There's also improved performance analysis in DevTools.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOU CAN CHOOSE TOOLS THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 People often choose obscure or outdated technologies for emotional
reasons, like feeling connected to a certain tradition or aligning
with specific aesthetics. They then create rationalizations for these
choices, downplaying the downsides of their preferred tech and
exaggerating the drawbacks of popular alternatives. However, it's
perfectly fine to use tools that bring you joy without any need for
justification. 

 REINVENT THE WHEEL (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It's common advice to avoid reinventing the wheel. However,
recreating existing tools and technologies is a valuable learning
experience. By building your own versions, you gain insights into
trade-offs, limitations, and potential improvements of existing
solutions. 

 GOOD WRITING (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Good writing is both aesthetically pleasing and conceptually
accurate, and these qualities are surprisingly interconnected.
Polishing the sound of writing often clarifies and refines the ideas
themselves, similar to how shaking a bin helps objects pack together
efficiently. This is because making writing sound good forces the
writer to confront and resolve inconsistencies or awkwardness in their
thinking.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A BRIEF HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT (33 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article traces JavaScript's 30-year evolution from Brendan
Eich's 10-day creation in 1995 to becoming the world's most popular
programming language, with major milestones like the browser wars,
AJAX enabling dynamic web apps (2005), Node.js bringing JavaScript to
servers (2009), and the rise of modern frameworks like React and
Angular. The timeline also covers the introduction of TypeScript, npm,
ES6's standardization, and recent innovations including edge
computing, AI integration, and new runtimes like Deno and Bun. 

 AT AMAZON, SOME CODERS SAY THEIR JOBS HAVE BEGUN TO RESEMBLE
WAREHOUSE WORK (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Amazon software devs are being pushed to use AI, leading to a faster
pace and higher output goals. Some engineers feel like they are
"bystanders" in their own jobs, as the focus has shifted from writing
code to reviewing AI-generated code, which reduces the time for
reflection and collaboration. While companies like Amazon argue AI can
relieve tedious tasks, some workers worry about the impact on career
advancement and the degradation of work quality.
