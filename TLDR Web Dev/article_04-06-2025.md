ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 ADOPTING DOCS-AS-CODE AT PINTEREST (11 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pinterest Engineering adopted a "docs-as-code" strategy. This
involved treating documentation like code, using Markdown, version
control, and CI/CD pipelines. They built PDocs, a centralized static
site generator, to host documentation across multiple repositories and
improve the developer experience. 

 WHAT HAPPENS IF WE INLINE EVERYTHING? (20 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Modifying LLVM to always inline every function call results in the
compiler bypassing typical profitability checks and reveals unexpected
interactions with other optimization passes. While compilation times
and executable sizes drastically increase, runtime performance is not
much worse and can even be slightly better.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOUR MANAGER IS NOT YOUR BEST FRIEND (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Managers should act as objective "scientists" to uncover the truth of
tough situations, providing perspective and constructive
communication. They should not agree with negative statements about
other teams or individuals and instead focus on solutions and
objective frameworks. 

 WHY GUIS ARE BUILT AT LEAST 2.5 TIMES (21 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Lean Software Development model is flawed because it
misinterprets the core activity of software creation. Software
development is not manufacturing, but rather a design process, where
the "factory" is the program itself, and developers are designers
constantly iterating to understand and fulfill user needs.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GEMINI IN CHROME — AI ASSISTANCE, RIGHT IN YOUR BROWSER (2 MINUTE
READ) [8]

 STORYBOOK 9 (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Storybook 9 introduces a streamlined component testing experience
with better testing capabilities and performance improvements. It
partners with Vitest and Playwright for faster test execution and
browser fidelity, with better interaction, accessibility, and visual
tests. 

 MONSTERUI: BRINGING BEAUTIFUL UI TO FASTHTML (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 MonsterUI makes web UI development easier in FastHTML Python apps by
providing pre-styled components and smart defaults. It has features
like themes, base components, semantic text styles, layout helpers,
common UI patterns, higher-level components, and markdown rendering.

 SWIFT AT APPLE: MIGRATING THE PASSWORD MONITORING SERVICE FROM JAVA
(8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Apple migrated its Password Monitoring service from Java to Swift,
resulting in a 40% performance increase. The team chose Swift due to
its efficiency and ability to better manage memory compared to Java,
which allowed for faster scaling and reduced server overhead. Using
the Vapor web framework and custom Swift packages, they rewrote the
service with less code, benefiting from Swift's protocol-oriented
approach and built-in safety features. 

 HOW WE WRAP EXTERNAL C AND C++ LIBRARIES IN RUST (8 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Rust's `build.rs` files can be kept simple by primarily using the
`cc` and `bindgen` crates for wrapping external C/C++ libraries.
Feature flags should be used to control vendoring and bindgen
generation. 

 "LEARN TO CODE" BACKFIRES SPECTACULARLY AS COMP-SCI MAJORS SUDDENLY
HAVE SKY-HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Today's Computer Science graduates are facing worse job prospects
than the average college graduate, and even worse than journalism
grads. The oversaturation of CS graduates, coupled with automation and
recent hiring practices, has created a job market that doesn't match
the promises made.

MINUTE READ) [14]

 A COMPLETE GUIDE TO META PROMPTING (29 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This is a comprehensive guide to meta prompting, a technique using

 VISION LANGUAGE MODELS ARE BIASED (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This paper shows that Vision Language Models show a lot of bias,
relying on memorized knowledge rather than visual analysis, which
leads to big failures when presented with slightly modified images. 

 GENERATIVE AI WILL PROBABLY MAKE BLOGS BETTER (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Generative AI will replace SEO-optimized content with genuine,
human-centered blog posts, returning the internet to a less
commercially driven and more authentic state.
