 JUST SAY NO TO MORE END-TO-END TESTS (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A testing strategy that relies heavily on end-to-end tests can cause
a lot of issues in reality. While end-to-end tests seem like a good
idea in theory, they often lead to delays in bug identification and
fixes, as well as flaky test results. Instead, a better approach is to
focus on unit tests and integration tests, which are often faster and
more reliable. 

 VISUALIZING ALGORITHMS FOR RATE LIMITING (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Rate limiting is used to control traffic on a service by blocking
requests that exceed a set limit. Three common algorithms for rate
limiting are fixed windows, sliding windows, and token buckets. Fixed
windows are easy to understand and implement, sliding windows are
better for high traffic, and token buckets allow for bursts of traffic
while enforcing a long-term average rate. 

 HOW TO DOCUMENT YOUR JAVASCRIPT PACKAGE (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 JSDoc is used to document JavaScript packages. It helps users
understand how to use your code and provides additional context within
their workflow. The key is to provide clear and concise information:
write succinct summaries, include accurate type information, use tags
to describe parameters and return values, and provide examples for
clarity.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SYSTEM TESTS HAVE FAILED (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 System tests often fail to live up to their promise. They are slow,
prone to errors, and rarely provide a good return on investment. While
they can be useful for basic functionality checks, they are not the
best tool for testing business logic or UI interactions compared to
manual testing. 

 ASK HN: VIDEO STREAMING IS EXPENSIVE YET YOUTUBE "SEEMS" TO DO IT FOR
FREE. HOW? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [8] 

 Engineers give their opinion on how YouTube seems to stream video for
free. Google has special relationships with major US ISPs to get low
bandwidth costs and also have the advantage of scale. 

 BUILDING A WAITLIST (THE WRONG WAY) (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This developer used a waitlist approach to validate the demand for
their failed product, PresetBot, an API to apply Lightroom presets on
images. They used Google Ads to drive traffic to a landing page, but
after attracting 250 signups and building the product, no one
purchased it. The developer realized that most of the signups were
likely from bots and click farms.

better.
