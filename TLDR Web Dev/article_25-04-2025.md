 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes and flaky tests are a bottleneck for your
engineering team, you need QA Wolf.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native platform SUPPORTS BOTH WEB AND MOBILE APPS,
delivering 80% automated test coverage in weeks [6] and helping teams
SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles to minutes.

With QA Wolf, you get:

✅ Unlimited parallel test runs

✅ 15-min QA cycles

✅ 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation

✅ Zero-flake guarantee

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] saw 4x more test cases
and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 GUIDE TO FAST WEBSITES WITH NEXT.JS: TIPS FOR MAXIMIZING SERVER
SPEEDS AND MINIMIZING CLIENT BURDEN (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Devs can build ultra-fast websites by focusing on user journey
metrics like server response, rendering, and interaction speed. Using
Next.js features such as pre-rendering, caching, and React Server
Components can help optimize performance. Each technique adds up to a
smoother overall user experience over time. 

 IMPOSSIBLE COMPONENTS (30 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post discusses a class of React components that attempt to mix
server-only and client-only logic, such as reading a file from the
filesystem (server-side) while handling user input (client-side). Such
components are “impossible” in traditional React rendering models.
This tension illustrates the need for clear boundaries between server
and client responsibilities. 

 HOW DOORDASH'S IN-HOUSE SEARCH ENGINE ACHIEVED A 50% DROP IN LATENCY
(13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 DoorDash replaced Elasticsearch with a custom-built search engine
using Apache Lucene to better handle complex relationships, custom
ranking, and large-scale indexing needs. Its architecture separates
indexing and search, supports fast segment replication, and includes a
declarative schema system with query planning.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ACQUISITIONS, CONSOLIDATION, AND INNOVATION IN AI (7 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 There's a difference between AI model and AI application innovation,
and value will accrue differently in each area. Startups can innovate
by focusing on specific use cases and integrating deeply with customer
workflows, which happens in the AI application side of things. 

 ON LOYALTY TO YOUR EMPLOYER. (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 There are four key criteria for vetting potential employers: fair
pay, good treatment of employees, financial stability, and openness to
new ideas. While a job may seem great initially with appealing perks,
employees are ultimately a transaction and should not sacrifice their
well-being or values for their employer.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NODE-MLX (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 node-mlx is a Node.js machine learning framework based on MLX. It has
support for GPU acceleration on Macs with Apple Silicon and CPU
support on x64 Macs and x64/arm64 Linux. node-mlx provides JavaScript
APIs that mirror the official Python MLX APIs with some adjustments
for JavaScript limitations. The repository includes examples for large
language models, vector databases, and image search. 

 INTRODUCING OUR LATEST IMAGE GENERATION MODEL IN THE API (8 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 OpenAI has released gpt-image-1, a new image generation model based
on the model that powers image generation in ChatGPT, in its API. This
API allows devs to integrate high-quality image generation into their
own tools and platforms with features like diverse styles, custom
guidelines, and accurate text rendering.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GENERATING 1 MILLION PDFS IN 10 MINUTES (17 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This blog post goes over a high-performance and cost-efficient PDF
rendering pipeline using Rust, AWS Lambda, and Typst. The solution
uses AWS services like API Gateway, SQS, Lambda, and S3 along with
performance optimizations like caching and batching. The resulting
system had a rendering latency of 34ms and a cost of $0.35 per million
PDFs. It was able to generate 1 million PDFs in 10 minutes. 

 MARK ZUCKERBERG SAYS SOCIAL MEDIA IS OVER (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Social media has evolved into a platform for content consumption,
with Meta's Facebook and Instagram leading the shift. The FTC is
challenging Meta's acquisitions of competitors like Instagram and
WhatsApp, arguing they reduce competition, while Meta claims the
market is too diverse for monopolies to exist.

 UNDERSTANDING WHY COUNT(*) CAN BE SLOW IN POSTGRESQL (6 MINUTE READ)
[21] 

 COUNT(*) can be slow in PostgreSQL due to MVCC and the need to verify
row visibility, but optimizations like filtering on indexed columns or
using approximate counts from pg_class can speed the query up.
