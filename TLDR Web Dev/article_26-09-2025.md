 YOUR DEVS ARE ALREADY USING AI. YOUR SECURITY TEAM JUST DOESN'T KNOW
IT YET (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Remember when devs were spinning up random cloud services without
telling ops? Now it's AI tools. 30% of employees are using AI without
telling their managers. Good luck explaining that the next time
something breaks in production.

This Enterprise AI Governance Kit [4] has 6 templates to get ahead of
the chaos: vendor security checklists, developer-friendly usage
policies, and a matrix to figure out which AI projects actually
matter.

Grab the free kit [4] before your next security audit asks awkward
questions. Download it free from you.com [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE WEB'S MOST TOLERATED FEATURE (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The CSS `zoom` property was a non-standard feature initially
introduced by Internet Explorer. Despite its initial lack of
standardization and quirks, `zoom` surprisingly ranked high in usage
metrics due to a "hack" used to fix IE behavior. Eventually,
developers and the CSS Working Group recognized the need for a
standardized, layout-affecting zoom, leading to its formal
specification and widespread support decades later. 

 YOU MAY BE LOOKING FOR A USESYNCEXTERNALSTORE (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 When you see a `useEffect` updating a `useState` with a subscription,
you should consider using `useSyncExternalStore` instead. This
pattern, while common, can cause jank because React renders the
component multiple times. `useSyncExternalStore` provides a cleaner
API, allows specifying a server-side default value, and reduces jank
by making sure the correct value is used on the initial render. 

 HOW TO ORGANIZE EXPO APP FOLDER STRUCTURE FOR CLARITY AND SCALABILITY
(8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To improve clarity and scalability in Expo Router projects, organize
your folder structure with a `/src` directory to separate app code
from configuration files. Create `/components` and `/screens` folders
for reusable UI elements and route-specific content, respectively.
Finally, use a `/utils` and `/hooks` folders for utility functions and
reusable React hooks, and a `/server` folder to manage API routes and
server-side logic.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE SELF-TRIVIALIZATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The self-trivialization of software development is the process of
solving complex problems so thoroughly that they become routine and
easily reusable. This trend is shown by the shift to high-level
languages, the rise of open-source libraries, and the usage of
AI-powered coding assistants. While it may seem like developers are
working themselves out of a job, they are instead evolving to focus on
architecture, integration, and innovation, freeing up their
creativity. 

 THE THEATRE OF PULL REQUESTS AND CODE REVIEW (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 PRs are often too large and complex, leading to shallow reviews and
code quality issues. Smaller, focused PRs (under 300 lines of code)
and commits tell a story that improves reviewability and
understanding. 

 THE ATTRIBUTE OF GREATNESS: DECISION LOG (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Your past self is a valuable mentor if you document important
decisions you make to learn from them later. Write down the context,
possibilities, and rationale behind decisions to later analyze and
understand how your perspective has evolved. By revisiting past
decisions, you can identify missed opportunities and improve your
future decision-making process.

 ATHLON 64: HOW AMD TURNED THE TABLES ON INTEL (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 In 2003, AMD released the Athlon 64, a 64-bit CPU, challenging
Intel's reluctance to extend the x86 architecture. Intel initially
pursued its own 64-bit architecture, Itanium, aiming for a clean break
from legacy systems and potential market dominance. However, AMD's
Athlon 64 offered backward compatibility and strong 32-bit
performance, appealing to users and businesses alike, leading to Intel
abandoning Itanium and adopting AMD64 (renamed Intel64). 

 OUR PLAN FOR A MORE SECURE NPM SUPPLY CHAIN (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In response to recent security breaches, GitHub is improving npm

two-factor authentication for local publishing, implementing granular
tokens with limited lifespans, and promoting trusted publishing.
Legacy tokens and TOTP-based 2FA will be deprecated, and token
publishing access will be restricted by default.
