 CRINGEY, BUT TRUE: HOW UBER TESTS PAYMENTS IN PRODUCTION (11 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Uber tests payment systems in production, since traditional staging
environments aren't enough for catching real-world bugs. It treats
deployments as experiments, carefully selecting a region for initial
rollout and continuously monitoring business metrics. This allows it
to identify and resolve issues early on with real-world data while
reducing the impact on users. 

 REACT COMPILER, HOW DOES IT WORK? (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article explains how React compiler works, specifically how it
applies memoization techniques for efficiency on functions and hooks.
The compilation involves traversing nodes, compiling functions, and
replacing original functions with optimized versions. If memoization
is applied, the compiler adds an import for `useMemoCache`. The
article details the compiler's operation from entry through Babel to
function transformation. 

 TONY HAWK'S PRO STRCPY (49 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the "Create-A-Park"
feature of various Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games. The vulnerability,
dubbed "Tony Hawk's Pro Strcpy", allows attackers to gain code
execution on multiple gaming consoles, including the original Xbox,
PlayStation 2, GameCube, and even the Xbox 360 (on a specific older
kernel version). This article explores the various methods used to
exploit the bug, ranging from simple save game hacks to intricate ROP
chains and network-based attacks.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE IN BECOMING AN ENGINEERING MANAGER (REDDIT
THREAD) [7] 

 This Redditor regrets becoming an Engineering Manager, finding the
role soul-sucking, boring, and tedious. They miss the hands-on coding
work they used to do and feel the management role is significantly
different and more complex than being a lead. Commenters note that
management is not a progression from engineering but rather a
different job entirely. 

 THE SENIOR ENGINEER ILLUSION: WHAT I THOUGHT VS. WHAT I LEARNED (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post debunks common misconceptions about senior engineers,
revealing that they are not coding superheroes but rather seasoned
professionals with experience dealing with complexity. Seniority
involves handling legacy systems, managing stakeholder expectations,
and orchestrating teams, not just writing code. True seniority comes
with continuous learning and adaptability. 

 PYTHON EXTENSIONS SHOULD BE LAZY (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Python's "everything is an object" philosophy slows down the parsing
of large codebases with the ast module due to the overhead of
converting C structs to Python objects. This conversion results in
excessive memory allocations and garbage collection. To address the
issue, this developer implemented a Rust extension that processed the
ASTs in Rust, only returning the final results to Python, resulting in
a 16x speedup and significantly reduced memory pressure. They argue
that Python extensions should be designed to be lazy, meaning that
they should only create Python objects when explicitly required, and
instead keep data in a compact, optimized format within their own
language.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ANNOUNCING OFFICIAL PUPPETEER SUPPORT FOR FIREFOX (10 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Puppeteer, a browser automation library, now officially supports
Firefox. Users can now write automation and perform end-to-end testing
using Puppeteer across both Chrome and Firefox. This support is built
on WebDriver BiDi, a cross-browser protocol currently undergoing
standardization. 

 VERCEL AI SDK 3.3 (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vercel AI SDK 3.3 introduces several new features for building AI
applications with JavaScript and TypeScript, including tracing with
OpenTelemetry for observability, multi-modal file attachments for chat
applications, a `useObject` hook for streaming structured object
generation to clients, and additional LLM settings like JSON schema
support, stop sequences, and custom headers.

 BENCHMARKING AWS LAMBDA COLD STARTS ACROSS JAVASCRIPT RUNTIMES (10
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article benchmarks the cold start performance of AWS Lambda
functions using Deno, Node.js, and Python runtimes. Deno shows
significantly better performance with faster startup times, especially
in smaller function configurations. This is likely due to Deno's
various runtime caches. You can make your Deno app start time even
faster by populating these caches ahead of time during the Docker
image creation so that they're immediately available when your
application executes in AWS Lambda. 

 FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF GLEAM: LOTS OF JOYS AND SOME ROUGH EDGES (15
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Gleam is a functional programming language targeting both the BEAM
and JavaScript. Its strengths lie in its excellent documentation,
welcoming community, and powerful features like pattern matching and
shadowing. However, the lack of loops, confusing type aliases, and
idiosyncratic grouping mechanisms may pose challenges for developers
accustomed to more traditional syntax.

 ASK HN: HOW DIFFERENT IS AWS/GCP/AZURE IN EVERYDAY WORK (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [15] 

 The foundations of each cloud platform are the same - edge cases are
where deeper knowledge and experience help one be more productive in
one cloud stack over another. 

 APPLE MEMORY HOLED ITS BROKEN PROMISE FOR AN OCSP OPT-OUT (2 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Apple broke its promise to allow Mac users to opt out of Developer ID
certificate revocation checks, erasing the promise from its support
document shortly after releasing macOS 14 Sonoma.

 Release is an AI development and deployment platform. 

 DON'T PIVOT INTO AI RESEARCH (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Despite its current allure, the field of AI research is likely to
become increasingly competitive and less lucrative due to the
dominance of large, capital-intensive companies and an oversupply of
talent, mirroring the decline of chip design as a high-status
profession.
