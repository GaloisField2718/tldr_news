ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 A VIRTUAL DOM IN 200 LINES OF JAVASCRIPT (18 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A virtual DOM makes UI modification easier by tracking changes in a
simplified representation of the DOM. A library tracks changes to the
root DOM element by keeping a structure of virtual nodes, representing
each HTML element. When the state changes, the library creates a new
virtual DOM, compares it to the previous one (diffing), and applies
the differences to the real DOM, making sure it matches the desired
state. 

 REMOVING AD TRACKERS AND COOKIES - THE TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE (18
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sentry recently removed non-essential cookies and trackers from its
public websites. It identified cookies using Chrome's developer
console and specialized scanners while using Content-Security-Policy
(CSP) reporting for a comprehensive overview. To maintain a cookieless
environment, Sentry implemented CSP with strict rules and continuous
monitoring using custom scripts and a cookie scanner. 

 WINTERJS VS. BUN: COMPARING JAVASCRIPT RUNTIMES (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 WinterJS is a new high-speed JavaScript runtime built with Rust and
the SpiderMonkey engine. While Bun has more comprehensive toolkit
features, WinterJS focuses more on speed and WinterCG compliance, but
lacks Windows and TypeScript support. While initial performance tests
favor Bun, WinterJS shows potential when it is run natively.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TRAINING IS NOT THE SAME AS CHATTING: CHATGPT AND OTHER LLMS DON'T
REMEMBER EVERYTHING YOU SAY (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A common misconception about LLMs like ChatGPT is that they learn and
memorize everything said to them during conversations. This is
inaccurate as these models function as stateless functions, processing
each conversation independently without retaining memory of previous
interactions. Features like ChatGPT's "memory" are actually prompting
tricks that insert relevant information into the context of ongoing
conversations.

laptop by making sure they had enough free disk space and RAM and
disabling swap. They used an indexing library that supported indexing
larger-than-memory datasets by compressing vectors.
