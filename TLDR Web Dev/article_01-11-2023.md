 JSON IS SLOWER. HERE ARE ITS 4 FASTER ALTERNATIVES (11 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 JSON's popularity is due to its human-readable format,
language-agnostic nature, and support in web browsers and APIs.
However, it can introduce performance challenges such as parsing
overhead, serialization/deserialization inefficiencies, and lack of
support for binary data. This article explores alternatives like
Protocol Buffers, MessagePack, BSON, and Avro, and provides
optimization strategies such as minimizing data size, using arrays
wisely, optimizing number representations, and employing server-side
caching. Real-world examples from LinkedIn, Uber, Slack, and Auth0 of
these alternatives in practice show improved performance over JSON. 

 HOW I SCALED AMAZON‚ÄôS LOAD GENERATOR TO RUN ON 1000S OF MACHINES
(10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TPSGenerator was created to handle large-scale livestreams like
Taylor Swift's concert. It initially worked on a single machine,
generating a specified number of transactions per second. As the need
for higher throughput grew, especially with events like Cyber Monday,
the tool evolved from a single-host system to a distributed one.
Utilizing a divide-and-conquer strategy, the tool‚Äôs developer
implemented a Controller ‚Üí Queue ‚Üí Worker architecture, where
tasks were broken down into smaller, manageable ones, and distributed
among multiple machines for execution. 

 THE TEN RULES OF SCHEMA GROWTH (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Development and production environments have different rules and
purposes, with production requiring strict adherence to guidelines for
stability. Schemas should prioritize growth (adding new elements) over
breakage (removing or changing existing elements). Effective schema
management emphasizes careful naming, the use of aliases and
namespaces, annotations for clarity, and planning for continuous
expansion.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TOP NON-TECHNICAL SKILLS FOR SENIOR ENGINEERS AND TECHNICAL LEADERS
(7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Even if not pursuing a management track, it‚Äôs important for senior
engineers to invest in non-technical skills to grow. This article
discusses several key non-technical skills that enhance engineering
leadership, including running effective meetings, mentoring junior
engineers, negotiating technical priorities, and communicating
clearly. 

 SIMPLIFY YOUR CONTROL FLOWS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Adding loops and conditionals can quickly make code harder to
understand. To reduce cognitive overhead and improve code readability,
it's advisable to encapsulate complex logic within functions or
methods. This simplifies control flow and makes it easier for
reviewers to understand and identify logic errors, leading to
maintainable and less error-prone code.
