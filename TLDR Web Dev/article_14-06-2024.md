üëÄ Identify the issues causing your poor Core Web Vitals

üë©‚Äçüíª¬†Setup Sentry to trace issues through your stack [4] to
the code level

üîé Find the backend problem that's responsible for your frontend
pain

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE ARCHITECTURE OF STRIPE'S DOCUMENT DATABASE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Stripe's internal database as a service, DocDB, is built on MongoDB
and designed for scalability and reliability. DocDB uses a proxy
server to handle read/write requests, a central Chunk Metadata Service
to track data chunk locations, and a Data Movement Platform for easy
data migration between shards. 

 ASYNC RUBY ON RAILS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Async programming can make Ruby on Rails apps faster by delaying
non-essential tasks and parallelizing I/O-bound operations. This can
be achieved using methods like `deliver_later` for emails,
`load_async` for database queries, and `dependent: :destroy_async` for
dependent associations. However, while async can speed up apps, it can
also add complexity, so it's better to address basic performance
issues first and use async judiciously.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 NOTEBOOKS ARE MCDONALDS OF CODE (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Python Notebooks promote bad coding habits like neglecting testing
and linting due to their ease of use and impermanence. They also
worsen personal productivity by causing distractions and creating
inconsistencies between the notebook environment and production. While
they seem fast to iterate on, they slow down team collaboration by
making it difficult to track changes, maintain awareness of ongoing
work, and share useful code snippets. 

 WHAT DO GENZ SOFTWARE ENGINEERS REALLY THINK? (40 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Pragmatic Engineer's survey of GenZ software engineers revealed
that despite generational labels, young software engineers share
common traits with older ones, particularly in valuing supportive and
accommodating work environments. GenZ respondents are described as
energetic, ambitious, and adept communicators who are ready to make a
significant impact in the tech industry. 

 MY THOUGHTS ON PYTHON IN EXCEL (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Microsoft's Python in Excel is designed as an alternative to Excel's
formula language, not VBA, and integrates Jupyter Notebook cells into
the grid. It is not ideal for beginners due to its non-interactive
data analysis and challenging diagnostics pane. However, it's still
pretty useful for computationally intensive tasks, AI applications,
advanced visualizations, and time-series analysis.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SAP + APACHE KAFKA FOR REAL-TIME CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES (SPONSOR) [10] 

 In this online talk by Confluent and SAP, you'll learn how to keep
every system that relies on SAP data in sync with the latest and
greatest real-time data. The session includes a demo of using SAP
Datasphere and Confluent's Kora Engine [11] to build real-time
applications at 60% lower cost. Watch now‚Üí [11] 

 WRITE BUG REPORTS DEVELOPERS LOVE (WEBSITE) [12] 

 A simple checklist of the essential items to include in your bug
reports. This includes a title, steps to reproduce, visual proof,
expected vs actual results, log statements if applicable, and
environment details. 

 QUARTZ (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your digital garden
and notes as a website for free. 

 REACT & CODEMOD ANNOUNCEMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Codemod provides tools to migrate code quickly. It is partnering with
the React team to build and maintain the `react-codemod` repo, which
offers open-source codemods to make React-related migrations fast.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PROVABLE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS HAVE LOTS OF PROMISE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Provable software systems guarantee the correct functioning of
software by using mathematical logic and proofs. This approach can
help to catch bugs and vulnerabilities early on, making systems more
reliable and secure. Simple systems that are more provable include an
IoT light bulb and a Lego garage with a cryptographic library. 

 GROUP CHATS RULE THE WORLD (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Private group chats have become the hub for interesting tech
discussions due to the cultural shifts and the rise of online
communities. The success of these group chats depends on a strong
leader, active members who inject new ideas, and the existence of
smaller side chats for private conversations. Groups should be diverse
and sizes should be limited, while inactive members should be pruned
to maintain the quality of discussions. 

 UNLOCKING THE POWER OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA WITH RAG (10 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Unstructured data like README files, code comments, and issue
descriptions are hard to analyze but hold valuable insights.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) uses additional data sources like
vector databases or search engines to improve the quality and
relevance of outputs from large language models. RAG can help surface
organizational best practices and uncover user pain points from
unstructured data by providing contextually relevant responses to
developers' questions to improve their productivity.

 Development on Firefox is now moving to Git for version control. 

 WHY SWIFT'S TYPE CHECKER IS SLOW (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Swift's type checker can be slow due to the way it infers types,
especially in complex expressions with multiple possible combinations,
leading to exponentially increasing compilation times. 

 SCAN HTML FASTER WITH SIMD INSTRUCTIONS: CHROME EDITION (5 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 Google Chrome's engine has adopted SIMD parsing of HTML to quickly
jump to specific characters.
