ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 COMMON CAUSES OF MEMORY LEAKS IN JAVASCRIPT (18 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Memory usage is tracked in Node.js (V8) with metrics like RSS, Heap
Total, Heap Used, External, and Array Buffers. There are various
causes of memory leaks, such as improperly managed variables,
persistent global objects, unremoved event listeners, closures
capturing variables, and circular references. Developers can profile
memory usage by using the `--prof` flag and analyzing the resulting
profile file to identify areas of potential memory leak. 

 HOW WE RUN MIGRATIONS ACROSS 2,800 MICROSERVICES (11 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Monzo manages library migrations across its 2,800 microservices by
having a dedicated team handle migrations, avoiding coordination
overhead. Its team has automated mass deployment tooling and automated
rollback checks, along with a monorepo structure to streamline the
process. This strategy, combined with a gradual roll-out approach and
the use of configuration systems for quick rollbacks, makes sure
downtime and headaches are minimized. 

 HOW META ENFORCES PURPOSE LIMITATION VIA PRIVACY AWARE INFRASTRUCTURE
AT SCALE (18 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta's Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI) is a large-scale initiative
designed to enforce purpose limitation. PAI's key component, Policy
Zones, provides a comprehensive mechanism for encapsulating,
evaluating, and propagating privacy constraints for data in transit
and at rest. Its integration across various Meta systems, including
function-based and batch-processing systems, makes sure that data is
only used for its intended purpose.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ANYONE ELSE FIND TAILWIND CSS A BIT TOO REDUNDANT? (REDDIT THREAD)
[7] 

 Reddit users debate whether Tailwind is too redundant or not. Some
people find the class names to be repetitive and difficult to
maintain. Others find Tailwind CSS to be helpful and time-saving. 

 MERCHANTS OF COMPLEXITY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 People often prefer complex solutions over simple ones, even though
they claim to want simplicity. This is because complex solutions make
people feel special and superior. Basic problems are often turned into
insurmountable challenges during development, requiring expensive
subscriptions for "sophisticated" solutions.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 [FUSIONAUTH BLOG] DON'T TRUST AN AUTH VENDOR WITHOUT SEEING IT RUN IN
YOUR APPLICATION (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Authentication is one of the main building blocks of any software
product, and you want to be really sure you're making the right
choice. The only reliable way to do that is to run it in your actual
code [9], in your actual application logic. If there's no free trial,
walk away. Read the blog [9] 

 SIMULACRUM (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Simulacrum allows you to write code to build interactive diagrams for
complex software flows. It's a React component with an IDE, a
compiler, and a runtime all working together. The compiler converts
your code into something that can emit the program's custom
instructions. 

 FREE PUBLIC APIS (WEBSITE) [11] 

 A collection of 224 free public APIs for developers that have been
verified and tested. 

 BACKGROUND REMOVER (WEBSITE) [12] 

 This is a free background remover that uses WebGPU to remove
backgrounds locally in-browser.

 5,000X FASTER CRDTS: AN ADVENTURE IN OPTIMIZATION (45 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 This developer was able to optimize CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated
Data types) for collaborative editing by 5,000x. They started with a
simple data structure change using a flat list instead of a tree. Then
they adopted a bidirectional linked list and run-length encoding,
leading to a 30x speedup compared to the original Automerge
implementation. Finally, by using Rust's memory control capabilities
and a range tree data structure, the developer achieved a 5,000x
speedup, demonstrating that CRDTs can achieve performance comparable
to native strings. 

 LOOMING LIABILITY MACHINES (LLMS) (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Using LLMs for root cause analysis (RCA) for cloud incidents is
probably not a great idea. LLMs, while capable of automating some
aspects of RCA, lack the depth and nuance of human experts.
Furthermore, there's the "automation surprise" problem, where
unexpected LLM behavior could lead to dangerous situations due to user
misunderstanding. 

 ACCURATE PROXY METRIC EVALUATION (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Netflix researchers developed methods to analyze historical A/B test
data to understand the relationship between proxy metrics and
long-term business outcomes. They propose three estimators that offer
more robust solutions for understanding the true relationship between
proxy metrics and north star metrics: Total Covariance (TC), Jackknife
Instrumental Variables Estimation (JIVE), and Limited Information
Maximum Likelihood (LIML).

AI models and plans to continue being transparent moving forward. 

 DOCKER APP HOSTING (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This article describes how to use Docker to host applications on a
VPS, which is cheaper and often easier to maintain than using
traditional cloud providers.
