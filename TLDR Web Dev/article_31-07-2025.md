 DEVCYCLE: FEATURE FLAGS WITHOUT VENDOR LOCK-IN, BUILT ON OPENFEATURE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Feature flags are an essential capability in modern software - do you
really want yours locked behind proprietary APIs?

	* OpenFeature is the CNCF-backed standard that lets you switch
providers without touching your code. It gives you one SDK that works
with any backend.
	* DevCycle [4] is the first and only platform built natively on
OpenFeature—deployed on edge architecture to deliver scalable
performance backed by enterprise-grade security and support.
 	* DevCycle's SDKs are open source [5], with well documented APIs, so
you're always in control of your feature flags wherever you decide to
run them.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FLUID COMPUTE: HOW WE BUILT SERVERLESS SERVERS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Vercel's Fluid compute optimizes serverless computing by efficiently
using resources, minimizing cold starts, and reducing costs. This
approach uses a custom TCP-based protocol and Rust-based core to
create secure tunnels between Vercel and AWS Lambda functions, turning
on HTTP streaming. The system also routes requests to existing idle
function instances, increasing resource utilization and breaking free
from the traditional one-invocation-per-instance model. 

 FROM ASYNC/AWAIT TO VIRTUAL THREADS (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Virtual threads in Python have the potential to be a better
alternative to async/await for concurrent programming. While
async/await exposed more people to concurrency, it introduced complex
machinery and colored functions, unlike threads, which are simpler in
concept. Embracing threads with structured concurrency and virtual
threads can improve ergonomics and performance, moving complexity to
the interpreter and internal APIs.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE HYPE IS THE PRODUCT (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Large tech companies prioritize stock prices over customer
satisfaction, creating monopolies through barriers to migration. These
companies use hype, like the current focus on AI, to drive investment
and inflate stock value, regardless of the actual usefulness of the
technology. In this case, the hype is the product itself. 

 FAST (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Software speed is often overlooked, yet it fundamentally changes
behavior. Fast software removes cognitive friction, shows simplicity
through focused design, and improves the user experience a lot.
Achieving speed demands prioritization, stripping away non-essential
features, and handling complexity behind the scenes. 

 VIBE CODE IS LEGACY CODE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vibe coding creates a lot of legacy code, which creates tech debt
upon creation due to a lack of understanding. While it's useful for
rapid prototyping and throwaway projects, vibe coding becomes
problematic when used for large, maintainable projects.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CODE AT THE SPEED OF THOUGHT WITH CLAUDE CODE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Build new functionality, create tests, and fix bugs with Claude Code,
your code's new collaborator.

 OLLAMA'S NEW APP (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Ollama has released a new macOS and Windows app that simplifies
interacting with language models. The app allows users to easily
download and chat with models, including the ability to drag and drop
files for analysis. It also supports multimodal functionality. 

 CRUSH (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Crush is an AI coding assistant for your terminal, allowing you to
integrate your tools, code, and workflows with various LLMs. It
supports features like multi-model selection, session management, and
extensibility via MCPs, working across macOS, Linux, and Windows. 

 UNDERCOVER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Undercover warns about methods, classes, and blocks that were changed
without tests, to help you easily find untested code and reduce the
number of bugs. It does so by analysing data from git diffs, code
structure, and SimpleCov coverage reports.

MISCELLANEOUS

 YES, THE MAJORITY OF LANGUAGE MIGRATIONS ARE DRIVEN BY HYPE (5 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 A recent survey showed that over 71% of language migrations are
driven by industry hype rather than proven results, with only half of
developers finding their migrations worthwhile. While AI tools are
making migrations easier and are used by 87% of developers, this can
lead to unnecessary revisions and technical debt. Instead, it's better
to pilot small-scale migrations, review case studies, and focus on
clear metrics to avoid regret. 

 THE MATH IS HAUNTED (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Lean is a programming language used by mathematicians to formalize
mathematics as code. Lean's syntax is shown with a simple theorem
proving 2 = 2, with tactics explained like `rfl` (reflexivity) and
`sorry` (which bypasses proof checking). Axioms can be introduced too,
even allowing for "haunted math" where 2 = 3. 

 CRITICAL VULNERABILITY IN AI VIBE CODING PLATFORM BASE44 (8 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Wiz Research discovered a vulnerability in the Base44 vibe coding
platform that allowed unauthorized access to private applications by
exploiting undocumented registration and email verification endpoints.
This vulnerability bypassed authentication controls and was quickly
reported to and fixed by Wix (Base44's parent company) within 24
hours.

 Figma announced the pricing of its IPO at $33.00 per share, with
shares expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under
the ticker symbol "FIG" on July 31. 

 I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE VIBE CODING (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Developers are sacrificing code quality and project conventions for
the sake of speed by blindly accepting LLM-generated code.

expired domains from 17 unfinished projects, finding value in the
learning process despite the lack of monetary success.
