 MAKING MULTIPLAYER GAMES IN JAVASCRIPT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Multiplayer games can be a scary concept for indie game developers as
it's really hard to design for all the different network conditions
with e.g. people playing on terrible 3G connections and across
continents.

If you're looking to dip your toes in the water, check out these new
articles on the Dusk blog:

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WINDOWS SECURITY BEST PRACTICES FOR INTEGRATING AND MANAGING SECURITY
TOOLS (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog post discusses the recent CrowdStrike outage, which was
caused by a memory safety error in the CSagent driver, and provides
technical insights into the root cause. Windows usually has safeguards
for the quality of third-party security products. Microsoft
discourages the use of kernel drivers by security solutions, but it is
forced to allow them due to regulation, which is one of the reasons
why the CrowdStrike outage happened. 

 HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST RENDERING STRATEGY FOR YOUR APP (11 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This article offers a detailed explanation of various rendering
strategies. It explores the ideal use cases, advantages, and
considerations for each strategy - Static Site Generation (SSG),
Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Client-Side Rendering (CSR), and
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR). SSG is good for static content,
ISR is great for periodically changing content, and SSR and CSR are
the best for real-time data. 

 A GENTLE INTRODUCTION TO SAML (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 SAML is a standard for exchanging security-related messages between
different entities, most commonly used for single sign-on (SSO). In
SSO, users authenticate with a centralized identity provider (IDP) and
then access multiple applications without having to log in to each one
individually. The service provider (SP) and IDP communicate via the
user's browser, exchanging SAML requests and responses. SAML responses
contain assertions about the user's identity, which are digitally
signed by the IDP to ensure authenticity and integrity.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 JUNIOR (IC3) TO STAFF (IC6) VIA JOB HOPPING (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Zach Wilson rapidly climbed the engineering ladder from Junior to
Staff in five years through strategic job hopping from Meta to Netflix
to Airbnb. He would build a strong internal brand by building trust
and would communicate his impact well to get promoted quickly. 

 PERFECTIONISM - ONE OF THE BIGGEST PRODUCTIVITY KILLERS IN THE
ENGINEERING INDUSTRY (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Perfectionism leads to wasted time, unnecessary stress, and
ultimately, hindered progress. Developers should shift their mindset
towards "good enough" and making progress. This post highlights the
importance of getting feedback early and shipping the smallest unit of
value. 

 DON'T BLINDLY PREFER `EMPLACE_BACK` TO `PUSH_BACK` (6 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 It is a common misconception that `emplace_back` in C++ automatically
enables move semantics. `emplace_back` is not magic and does not
implicitly move objects. Using `std::move` is necessary to explicitly
request a move operation. While both `push_back` and `emplace_back`
can achieve the same result with `std::move`, `push_back` should be
used by default for better compile-time performance, as `emplace_back`
involves more complex template instantiation.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 KY (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Ky is a lightweight HTTP client built on the Fetch API. It offers
simplified requests, automatic error handling, and JSON support. Ky
provides features like timeouts, retries, URL prefixes, and hooks for
advanced customization. It is compatible with modern browsers and
Node.js. 

 REACT-NATIVE-FILAMENT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 react-native-filament is a 3D rendering library for React Native
apps. It utilizes Filament for high-quality graphics and Bullet3 for
physics simulation. react-native-filament offers a declarative API,
GPU acceleration, and multithreading for efficient rendering. 

 OPSLANE (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Opslane is a tool that helps make the on-call experience less
stressful. It reduces alert fatigue by classifying alerts as
actionable or noisy and providing contextual information for handling
alerts.

 TWO THREADS, ONE CORE: HOW SIMULTANEOUS MULTITHREADING WORKS UNDER
THE HOOD (21 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article explains how Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) works in
modern CPUs. SMT enables a processor to handle instructions from two
different threads simultaneously by duplicating certain resources and
sharing others. This can improve resource utilization and system
throughput, but also introduces potential performance issues due to
resource competition and security vulnerabilities. 

 HOW DID FACEBOOK INTERCEPT ITS COMPETITOR'S ENCRYPTED MOBILE APP
TRAFFIC? (13 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A technical investigation revealed that a decade ago, Facebook,
through its Onavo Protect app, intercepted encrypted mobile traffic
from users' devices. This was achieved by exploiting a vulnerability
in Android's security controls, which allowed Facebook to install a
custom certificate authority (CA) certificate on users' devices,
enabling it to decrypt HTTPS traffic. This practice, dubbed "SSL
bump," was used to target competitor analytics domains like Snapchat,
YouTube, and Amazon, granting Facebook insights into their in-app
actions. 

 MY FAVORITE TOOLS + TECHNIQUES FOR PROCEDURAL GAMEDEV (13 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 This author goes over their procedural game development tools and
techniques, such as triplanar mapping, hex tiling, depth pre-passes,
and AI-powered texture synthesis. Each offers unique benefits for
enhancing visual quality and performance in 3D scenes. The author also
discusses his work on procedural mesh processing and manipulation, a
pipeline for creating realistic deformations, and modifications to
game assets in real-time. Looking ahead, the author intends to explore
constructive solid geometry, a method for applying Boolean operations
to 3D space.
