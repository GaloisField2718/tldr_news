ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 YOU'RE LOADING FONTS WRONG (AND IT'S CRIPPLING YOUR PERFORMANCE) (8
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Most websites handle fonts terribly, creating unnecessary performance
bottlenecks even though typography directly impacts user experience
and business results. This deep dive traces how we got here - from
early "web-safe" fonts through clunky Flash workarounds to today's
Google Fonts - and explains why outdated practices and misconceptions
still plague modern web development. The author makes the case that
fonts deserve as much optimization attention as images or JavaScript,
and promises to show you how browsers actually load fonts and how to
do it right. 

 UNLOCKING WEB WORKERS WITH REACT: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 This guide shows React devs how to use Web Workers to prevent their
apps from freezing during heavy computations. Starting with a common
problem - UI that locks up when calculating something like Fibonacci
numbers - the author walks through moving these tasks off the main
thread. The tutorial covers practical implementation details and
progresses to more advanced patterns like task queuing, caching
results, and using Shared Workers to communicate between different
browser tabs. 

 ROLLING THE DICE WITH CSS RANDOM() (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Until now, there hasn't been a way to create random numbers in CSS.
CSS is getting a built-in random() function that can be useful for
adding natural variation to animations, layouts, colors, and
positioning. The function works with different number types like
pixels, percentages, and angles, opening up possibilities for randomly
scattered star backgrounds, organic grid layouts, and tilted photo
stacks. You can even share the same random values across multiple
elements using named identifiers.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 STANFORD STUDY FINDS AI HAS REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF ENTRY-LEVEL
PROGRAMMING JOBS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A Stanford study tracking millions of payroll records revealed that
entry-level programming jobs for recent graduates have dropped 20%
since ChatGPT launched in late 2022. The researchers found that AI
automation - not broader economic trends - is driving job losses
across software development, customer service, accounting, and admin
roles. Overall, entry-level positions in AI-exposed fields are down
6%. Meanwhile, older workers and people in jobs where AI serves as a
helpful tool rather than a replacement are actually seeing 6-13% job
growth. 

 SOME THOUGHTS ON LLMS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 We're measuring AI adoption all wrong - most surveys focus on basic
autocomplete features instead of more powerful workflows where AI
directly modifies your codebase. We're in an AI bubble that will
eventually burst, but it might deliver genuine value first. There are
some concerning security risks, especially AI browser extensions that
could be manipulated into accessing private accounts. It is unknown
what this all means for programming careers. 

 CAREER FRAMEWORKS 🪜 (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Career frameworks are structured documents that map out how engineers
progress through different levels and what skills they need at each
stage. They solve three key problems: making hiring decisions more
consistent by clarifying what each role actually requires, helping
engineers understand how to advance their careers, and reducing bias
in performance reviews through objective criteria. Small teams under
10 people should start with basic engineering principles, then build
out full frameworks once clear seniority gaps appear or when they
introduce management tracks.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LIFTKIT: UI FRAMEWORK BASED ON THE GOLDEN RATIO (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 LiftKit is a UI framework built around golden ratio proportions that
takes you from design mockups to production code. It automatically
corrects visual spacing and uses Material 3's dynamic color system
while offering both a component library and matching Figma/Webflow
templates. You can either start with a Next.js template or add LiftKit
to an existing project through its CLI. LiftKit is aimed at designers
and developers who want pixel-perfect results with advanced visual
features. It automatically removes unused CSS to keep builds lean. 

 D2: A MODERN LANGUAGE THAT TURNS TEXT INTO DIAGRAMS (WEBSITE) [11] 

 D2 lets users create polished diagrams by writing simple text
descriptions instead of dragging boxes around. It comes with
professional themes, a hand-drawn sketch style, animations, and
built-in support for software-specific elements like code blocks,
database tables, and UML diagrams. It can be used anywhere - through
command line tools, editor plugins, or a web playground - and diagrams
can be exported to whatever format required.

 DESIGNING THE BUILT-IN AI WEB APIS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Chrome's AI team is building web APIs that let users run AI models
directly in the browser, aiming to make these capabilities standard
across all browsers. The tricky part is designing APIs for such a
fast-moving field - they're creating client-side JavaScript interfaces
that work with models running locally on users' devices instead of the
usual server-based approach. Their key decisions include using
persistent sessions to manage resources better, creating unified
message formats that work across different AI providers, and solving
compatibility issues, since each browser might use completely
different AI models under the hood. 

 FINDINGS FROM A PILOT ANTHROPIC - OPENAI ALIGNMENT EVALUATION
EXERCISE (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In summer 2025, Anthropic and OpenAI tested each other's AI models
for dangerous behaviors like being overly agreeable, helping with
harmful requests, and trying to preserve themselves when threatened.
With some safety features turned off, they found that while no models
were seriously misaligned, OpenAI's o3 reasoning model performed best
overall. However, several OpenAI models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o4-mini)
were more willing to help with dangerous tasks like synthesizing drugs
or bioweapons compared to Claude. Both companies' models showed
troubling tendencies to agree with users holding harmful beliefs and,
when given the chance, attempted self-preservation through tactics
like blackmail.

 WHAT IS THE GO PROXY EVEN DOING? (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Go module proxy has a wasteful habit of downloading entire
repositories from scratch every time it checks for updates, even when
nothing has changed. 

 FROM NEXT.JS TO ASTRO: A PAGE SIZE COMPARISON (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A numbers comparison after porting a small static Next.js site to
Astro, reducing bundle size from 257kB -> 91kB and faster LCP. 

 CREATE DEVELOPMENT BUILDS WITHOUT AN APPLE DEVELOPER PROGRAM (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Registering all team devices through Expo, having the paid developer
regenerate credentials to include everyone's device IDs, and then
downloading those credentials locally to build and install development
versions using 'eas build --local' lets unpaid team members test on
real devices without cloud build credits while using the paid
account's signing capabilities.
