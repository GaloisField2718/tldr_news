ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE MISSING TIER FOR QUERY COMPILERS (14 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Modern database query engines are bottlenecked by interpreter
overhead, and while vectorized interpreters are great for OLAP
queries, compiling queries to native code makes OLTP queries faster.
However, building query compilers is complex and currently lacks a
commoditized baseline compiler approach like that used successfully in
browser JavaScript/WebAssembly engines, leaving a performance gap that
a baseline compiler could fill. 

 LEAKING THE EMAIL OF ANY YOUTUBE USER FOR $10,000 (8 MINUTE READ) [5]


 A vulnerability was discovered allowing the leakage of YouTube users'
Gaia IDs through the `/get_item_context_menu` endpoint. This ID could
then be used with the Pixel Recorder service to get the user's email
address, even though the service initially required a long recording
title to suppress notification emails.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I FAILED MY ANTHROPIC INTERVIEW AND CAME TO TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT SO
YOU DON'T HAVE TO (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This developer's unsuccessful Anthropic Research Fellowship interview
had three stages. The first stage was a challenging, timed automated
coding test, which required him to code fast. The second stage
included a LeetCode-style coding problem and reference checks. The
third stage was a virtual onsite which consisted of a research
brainstorm, a take-home assignment (partially completed despite
cancellation), and a culture fit interview. 

 VILLAIN ERA - PART 1 (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Through developing an iOS app, this developer found SwiftUI to be
unstable and hard to work with on the side of his full-time job.
Furthermore, paid ads were a money sink, which led the dev to abandon
the app until a pivot led to unexpected success later on. 

 MOVE ON TO ESM-ONLY (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Modern tools like Vite and Vitest, along with Node.js' improved ESM
(ES Modules) support, have made the adoption of ESM-only packages
worth it. The benefits of ESM-only include simpler maintenance,
smaller bundles, and improved tooling. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 💔 WHY DEVELOPERS HATE LINTERS (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Linters sound great in theory. In practice, they're often a source of
warning fatigue, endless debates about style, and awkward code written
to appease the linter. Read about how to make linting a friend rather
than a foe on the CodeRabbit blog [9]; or explore modern ways to
improve code quality with AI-powered code review [10]. 

 PGASSISTANT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 PgAssistant is an open-source tool that helps developers understand
and optimize their PostgreSQL database performance. It provides
insights into database behavior, identifies schema-related issues, and
assists in correcting them. 

 FULLSOAK (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 FullSoak is a no-build TypeScript full-stack framework for creating
web apps fast. It removes the need for tools like tsc and webpack
while prioritizing SSR. FullSoak uses a controller-based architecture
with client-side hydration.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LEAGUE OF LEGENDS DATA SCRAPING THE HARD AND TEDIOUS WAY FOR FUN (25
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 By reverse-engineering the replay files of League of Legends, a
high-fidelity dataset was able to be created. This was a big win
because existing datasets are limited in granularity and completeness.
The tool decrypts and processes replay files, extracting precise
gameplay data at millisecond intervals through custom emulation and
techniques like trampoline hooking. 

 SMUGGLING ARBITRARY DATA THROUGH AN EMOJI (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Arbitrary data can be embedded within a single emoji using Unicode
variation selectors. These selectors, while invisible in rendering,
can be concatenated after a base character to represent bytes of data.
This effectively hides information, as shown further with example
code. 

 ARE EFFICIENCY AND HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY AT ODDS? (9 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Systems optimized for scalability often perform poorly on a single
machine, and vice-versa, due to factors like coordination overhead and
the loss of shared resources when distributing computation. Amdahl's
Law and real-world examples, such as CPython's GIL, show this
trade-off.

QUICK LINKS

 STATE OF REACT 2024 (WEBSITE) [16] 

 The 2024 State of React survey gathered 7,870 responses to identify
trends in the React ecosystem, such as the fact that forwardREf and
memo were pain points among common APIs that React 19 aims to address.


 THE OVERUSE OF BROWSER ENGINES IN DESKTOP APPLICATIONS (3 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 While convenient for developers, the increasing use of browser
engines in desktop apps leads to excessive resource consumption and
performance issues. 

 SMOLMODELS (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 Smolmodels is a Python library that allows users to create machine
learning models using natural language descriptions, as the library
handles data generation, feature engineering, training, and model
saving/loading. 

 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ESLINT AND TYPESCRIPT (12 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 ESLint is a linter that enforces coding style and best practices,
while TypeScript is a type checker for type safety.
