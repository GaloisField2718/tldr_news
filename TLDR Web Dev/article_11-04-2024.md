 üîß SENTRY‚ÄôS NEW AI-POWERED AUTOFIX IS HERE TO FIX YOUR BROKEN
CODE (SPONSOR) [3] 

 There are many genAI tools that can help you write code. But do they
have the contextual data to help you fix errors in production?
Sentry‚Äôs Autofix [3] understands what your users are doing when an
error occurs, analyzes the error, generates a fix and even opens a PR.
It‚Äôs like having an extra junior developer.

Join this virtual session [3] to see a live demo of Autofixing a
frontend and backend issue, and how Sentry is using ML to better
prioritize issues and alerts [3] ‚Äî including more intelligent issue
grouping and alerting.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CODE SEARCH IS HARD (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Code search is a hard problem to solve compared to normal search.
Search tools often optimize for natural language, but these techniques
make code search worse. Most big companies have custom code search
tools, which is a sign of how difficult the problem is. Postgres has
functions that can make code search easier, like its full text search
options. 

 HOW I WRITE TESTS IN GO (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Golang comes with its own testing library, which is not common among
popular programming languages. Unit tests in Go should be written to
run in parallel by default so that concurrency issues are surfaced
early on. The testing package has a comprehensive set of flags and can
provide code coverage reports, race condition detection, static
analysis, shuffled test execution, and more.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SHELL HISTORY IS YOUR BEST PRODUCTIVITY TOOL (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This blog demonstrates how customizing ZSH shell history
configurations can be a boon for your productivity. These tips make it
easier to find and reuse past commands quickly. You can efficiently
access a personalized command library by tuning history storage and
implementing advanced search techniques such as ‚Äòfzf‚Äô and
‚Äòag‚Äô. 

 DON'T REQUIRE PEOPLE TO CHANGE 'SOURCE CODE' TO CONFIGURE YOUR
PROGRAMS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Programs should avoid requiring users to modify source code files
(like Makefiles or header files) for configuration purposes. This is
because it can often lead to merge conflicts during updates later on,
which can be difficult to debug. Configurations should be handled
through other methods instead.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CODEGEMMA (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CodeGemma, a collaborative effort between Google and Hugging Face, is
a family of open-access, code-specialized LLMs. The models are
available in 2B and 7B configurations. They have been fine-tuned with
a lot of data to bring better performance in logical reasoning and
programming suggestions. 

 AIDER (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Aider is a command-line tool that lets you directly edit code in your
files while pair-programming with GPT. It will git commit changes with
AI-generated commit messages. 

 DECO (WEBSITE) [10] 

 Deco is a real-time TypeScript web editor. You can code directly on
the web or on your machine and get instant feedback.

 GEMINI 1.5 AND GOOGLE‚ÄôS NATURE (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The recent Google Cloud Next keynote showcased Google‚Äôs vast,
scalable AI infrastructure, which is difficult to replicate. Gemini
models can now be integrated with Google Search and enterprise data
sources, reducing hallucinations and creating better answers. Gemini
1.5 Pro can process up to 1 million tokens of information, which is a
breakthrough in long context understanding. Google is integrating
Gemini into many of its enterprise products, such as Google Workspace
and code development tools, which is another competitive advantage for
them. 

 NOTES ON GIT'S ERROR MESSAGES (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Git‚Äôs error messages can be confusing to understand, but there are
some great strategies to help decode them. Git status clarifies the
current branch state, and git log helps examine commits and identify
divergence points. You can also customize your shell prompt to display
branch status, which can be helpful. 

 WHY CAN'T MY MOM EMAIL ME? (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This author was receiving encrypted emails with blank bodies from his
mother. The issue was Proton's use of the Web Key Directory (WKD),
which automatically encrypts emails if a public key is found for the
recipient's address, even if the user didn't explicitly enroll in the
service. The author‚Äôs email address was enrolled, so he received
blank emails.

 "BATBADBUT" VULNERABILITY DISCOVERED IN RUST STANDARD LIBRARY ON
WINDOWS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A vulnerability named "BatBadBut" was discovered in the Rust standard
library on Windows that allows arbitrary command execution due to
improper argument escaping when invoking batch files.

memory leaks, disabling redundant type checking, and optimizing some
functions.
