ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY "WHAT HAPPENED FIRST?" IS ONE OF THE HARDEST QUESTIONS IN
LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Determining the precise order of events in large-scale distributed
systems is challenging due to imperfect clock synchronization across
computers. Network latency and clock drift make it impossible to rely
on wall-clock time for accurate ordering. Instead, computer scientists
use logical clocks to track the "happened-before" relationship between
events, which assign increasing counters to events and messages,
making sure that if event A caused event B, A's logical timestamp will
be lower than B's. 

 TERMINAL SESSIONS YOU CAN BOOKMARK: BUILDING ZELLIJ'S WEB CLIENT (13
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Zellij's new built-in web client allows users to access terminal
sessions from a browser. The web client uses a client/server
architecture, with a Rust-based web server acting as a translation
layer between the browser's websockets and the Zellij server's IPC
channels. The web server supports unique URLs for each session,
authentication using tokens, and separate WebSocket channels for
terminal data and control messages. The client-side uses xterm.js for
terminal emulation and incorporates custom integrations for features
like mouse tracking and window titles.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOU SHOULD DELETE TESTS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 While automated tests are necessary for maintaining confidence when
making code changes, they should be deleted when they are flaky. Tests
that are flaky, too strict, too slow to run regularly, or outdated due
to changed business requirements all harm developer productivity. 

 COGNITIVE LOAD IS WHAT MATTERS (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cognitive load refers to the mental effort required to understand and
work with code. Excessive cognitive load can lead to confusion,
errors, and delays. Developers should work on reducing extraneous
cognitive load while working on code by avoiding overly complex
conditionals, minimizing inheritance, and using clear, self-describing
variable names. 

 USE ONE BIG SERVER (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The conventional wisdom of scaling horizontally with distributed
systems and microservices is not always true. Sometimes, using a
single, powerful server is enough for most web services. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AGENT CLIENT PROTOCOL (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 The Agent Client Protocol standardizes communication between code
editors and AI coding agents. The project provides libraries and
schemas in Rust and TypeScript, along with a JSON schema. 

 SOSUMI.AI (WEBSITE) [10] 

 Sosumi.ai is a service that converts Apple Developer documentation
into AI-readable Markdown format, allowing LLMs to access and utilize
this information for tasks like generating Swift code.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE DEFAULT TRAP: WHY ANTHROPIC'S DATA POLICY CHANGE MATTERS (6
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Anthropic's recent policy change is that Claude user conversations
are now used for training data by default unless users opt out. Users
should stay informed and intentional about their data sharing. 

 VIBE SHIFT? SENIOR DEVELOPERS SHIP NEARLY 2.5X MORE AI CODE THAN
JUNIOR COUNTERPARTS (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A survey found that senior developers ship much more AI-generated
code than junior developers. Senior developers also reported spending
more time fixing AI code, but overall, they find that AI tools help
them ship faster. 

 WHAT EVERY ARGUMENT ABOUT SIDELOADING GETS WRONG (3 MINUTE READ) [13]


 There's an ongoing debate about sideloading in the context of
Google's recent Android restrictions. Restrictions on sideloading are
not about controlling hardware usage, but about controlling the
software (operating system) provided with the hardware. The core issue
should be the ability to install alternative operating systems on
hardware, with manufacturers providing adequate support.

QUICK LINKS

 WE NEED TO SERIOUSLY THINK ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH C++ MODULES (13
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 C++ modules should be removed from the standard if they cannot
demonstrate a large (5-10x) compilation time speedup across multiple
open-source projects, as the current implementation is overly complex,
lacks a clear product owner, and doesn't provide enough benefit to
outweigh the disadvantages for the average developer. 

 AI MODELS NEED A VIRTUAL MACHINE (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A standardized virtual machine for AI models is useful to improve
security, interoperability, and management by decoupling model logic
from integration logic, similar to the Java Virtual Machine. 

 MY PHONE IS AN EREADER NOW (16 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Minimal Phone is an Android phone with an e-paper display and a
physical keyboard. 

 IS IT POSSIBLE TO ALLOW SIDELOADING *AND* KEEP USERS SAFE? (20 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 There's a dilemma of balancing user freedom to sideload Android apps
with the need to protect vulnerable users from scams, which makes the
sideloading discussion with Android difficult.
