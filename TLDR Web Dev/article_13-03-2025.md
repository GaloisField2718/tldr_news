ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 A LOOK UNDER THE HOOD: HOW (AND WHY) WE BUILT QUESTION ASSISTANT (8
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Stack Overflow developed Question Assistant, a tool designed to
provide automated feedback to question askers, using both classic ML
techniques and Google's Gemini AI. Initial attempts to use LLMs to
directly rate question quality proved unreliable, so it created
feedback indicators and individual logistic regression models for
areas like context and background. These models flag questions needing
specific feedback, which is then synthesized by Gemini into actionable
suggestions for improvement. 

 CSS RELATIVE COLORS (17 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CSS relative colors are a new feature that allows devs to dynamically
generate colors based on existing ones. This article goes over the
syntax of relative colors and provides practical visual examples, such
as adjusting opacity, creating lighter or darker shades, and
generating dynamic gradients. Different color spaces like hsl, lch,
and oklch can also be used for use cases like having more consistent
brightness and contrast. 

 7 BEST PRACTICES OF FILE UPLOAD WITH JAVASCRIPT (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 When optimizing file uploads in JavaScript, devs should make sure to
optimize images, set file boundaries for size and type, and use
placeholder images like ThumbHash for faster loading. Even better
would be to give users cropping tools, initiate their uploads before
the send button is pressed, allow them to upload files in parallel,
and slice large files into smaller chunks behind the scenes.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE 7 BEHAVIORS THAT SEPARATE JUNIORS FROM SENIORS (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Junior devs tend to report problems, await clear instructions, and
focus on individual growth, while senior employees offer solutions,
proactively communicate status, and prioritize team and business
success. Adopting these behaviors, regardless of current title, is
necessary for career advancement. Seniors also embrace ambiguity, take
ownership of career growth, and prioritize pragmatic solutions over
unattainable perfection. 

 HOW I USE CURSOR (+ MY BEST TIPS) (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This developer uses Cursor's "YOLO mode" for automated testing and
bug fixing, and uses a test-driven development approach when using AI.
In this post, he shares tips for using Cursor to fix TypeScript
errors, generate commit messages, debug with logs, and improve UI
design. 

 AN OPINIONATED GUIDE ON WHICH AI MODEL TO USE IN 2025 (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 ChatGPT is the best all-around option due to its multimodal
capabilities, voice conversations, and Deep Research feature. Claude
is great at writing and coding, making it a top choice for editors and
developers. Gemini stands out with its long context window and video
processing capabilities.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING GEMMA 3: THE MOST CAPABLE MODEL YOU CAN RUN ON A SINGLE
GPU OR TPU (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google DeepMind has released Gemma 3, a collection of
state-of-the-art open models built from the same technology as Gemini
2.0 designed to be fast and run directly on devices. Gemma 3 comes in
various sizes (1B to 27B) and has great performance, multilingual
support for 140 languages, advanced reasoning capabilities, and a
large 128k-token context window. 

 YAAK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Yaak is an open-source desktop API client built with Tauri, Rust, and
ReactJS. It's used for interacting with various APIs including REST,
GraphQL, and WebSockets. It can authorize requests, filter responses,
and chain requests together, with features like workspace
organization, environment variables, template tags, theming, data
mirroring for Git integration, and response history. 

 NUANCED (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Nuanced is a tool that uses static analysis to generate enriched
function call graphs of Python modules. This helps AI agents and
coding assistants in understanding code behavior. It provides a
command-line interface for initializing, enriching, and adding context
to these graphs. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 REVERSE ENGINEERING OPENAI CODE EXECUTION TO MAKE IT RUN C +
JAVASCRIPT (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 After discovering the inner workings of OpenAI's code execution
environment by debugging port allocation with ChatGPT, this developer
was able to make the execution environment run C and JavaScript by
compiling them within the Python Jupyter Kernels. OpenAI has Jupyter
Kernels running on ZeroMQ, and its environment uses Kubernetes on
Azure with gVisor for isolation. 

 WHAT EVERY DEVELOPER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT GPU COMPUTING (16 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 GPUs are especially important to understand today due to their
necessity in deep learning and AI. This article goes over the
fundamental differences between CPUs and GPUs, with GPUs optimized for
parallelism and high throughput. It also discusses GPU architecture,
including streaming multiprocessors (SMs), memory hierarchy, and how
GPUs tolerate high latencies to achieve their throughput. 

 MY SALES PITCH FOR TYPESCRIPT (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 TypeScript makes JavaScript better by adding type information, which
allows for earlier error detection and better auto-completion during
development. This added type layer serves as documentation while also
helping with safer refactoring. Modern tooling makes TypeScript
adoption easier with direct execution on platforms like Node.js and
built-in bundler support.

QUICK LINKS

 THE DUCKDB LOCAL UI (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 DuckDB has released a new local web UI, providing an easy-to-use
alternative to the CLI for querying, exploring, and managing DuckDB
databases. 

 FILEPIZZA (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 FilePizza is a browser-based, peer-to-peer file transfer service that
uses WebRTC for fast, private, and secure file sharing without
intermediary server storage. 

 A COMMITTED YEAR (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A year of daily coding taught this developer lessons about the
challenges of web dev and the importance of iteration and rest. 

 WHY I STOPPED EVERYTHING AND STARTED WRITING C AGAIN (5 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Driven by frustration with virtual machine and container security and
the limitations of garbage collection in languages like Common Lisp,
this developer returned to C to develop a performant and portable
language (KC3) and reimplement their Common Lisp graph database. 

 GEMINI ROBOTICS BRINGS AI INTO THE PHYSICAL WORLD (8 MINUTE READ)
[20]
