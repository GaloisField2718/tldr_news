ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY WOULD ANYONE NEED JAVASCRIPT GENERATOR FUNCTIONS? (18 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 JavaScript generator functions provide a way to create lazy
iterators, allowing on-demand data processing for tasks like handling
large datasets or infinite sequences. They allow for the creation of
custom iterators without loading all elements into memory, which is
helpful for complex operations such as generating prime numbers or
managing unique identifiers. Generators support two-way message
passing, which can be used to mimic async/await syntax in JavaScript. 

 EVOLVING A NOSQL DATABASE SCHEMA (25 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 NoSQL database schemas evolve over time. Evolving them in an
efficient manner requires a good understanding of keys, indexes, and
queries. For example, knowing how to set and use composite primary
keys and secondary indexes is necessary for handling various search
and sort requirements. This article goes into how to evolve NoSQL
schemas, with a deep dive into both concepts and also advanced issues
like getting around the issue of partition limits by using shard keys.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ALGORITHMS WE DEVELOP SOFTWARE BY (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This developer discusses an interesting software development
methodology where developers start a feature each day and delete it if
not completed, repeating the process until success. This encourages
frequent rewrites, leading to cleaner code and a deeper understanding
of the problem. 

 THOUGHTS ON THE RESILIENCY OF WEB PROJECTS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Starting new projects has a cost of maintenance due to framework
versions and dependencies going out of date. Using solutions like
plain PHP and considering commitment levels beforehand can make sure a
new project survives to see long-term usage. 

 SALARY EXPECTATIONS QUESTIONS - HOW SHOULD YOU ANSWER THEM? (34
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to navigate salary
expectations questions during job interviews. For example, disclosing
your current salary or expected salary can reduce your negotiation
power.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT IN THE NEXT UNICORN APP (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 In this post, the CTO of Roots, a mindfulness app, goes through his
approach to leading a remote team. Leading a remote team requires
having a strong vision and hiring highly independent people. In terms
of team culture, Roots' team focuses on investing in the right
features before hiring more people and prioritizing thoughtful product
development over rapid releases. 

 ON TYPESETTING ENGINES: A PROGRAMMER'S PERSPECTIVE (30 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 There are various typesetting engines available, and they can be
evaluated on some key criteria: Knuth Plass line breaking algorithm,
CJK typesetting support, pagination, and instant preview. This article
goes over HTML and CSS, LaTeX.js, Typst, and React-pdf. Only LaTeX
consistently meets all the requirements. 

 ADVENTURES IN PROBABILITY (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Exponential distributions come into play in various fields like
queueing theory, control theory, and performance modeling. The
"memoryless" property of the exponential distribution makes it useful
for simulating systems involving events occurring independently at
random intervals. This post explains how to simulate such events using
the exponential distribution and provides an example of how to model a
queuing system with code.
