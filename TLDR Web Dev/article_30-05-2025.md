 HOW NASA IS USING GRAPH TECHNOLOGY AND LLMS TO BUILD A PEOPLE
KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 NASA is using graphs and LLMs to create a People Knowledge Graph.
This graph-powered system is built on Memgraph and runs on AWS. It
connects employees, projects, and skills to facilitate subject matter
expert discovery, project similarity analysis, and real-time
organizational insights. NASA ingests data from various sources,
extracts skills using LLMs, and uses a RAG-based chatbot interface for
querying the graph in natural language. 

 WHY REACT ERROR BOUNDARIES AREN'T JUST TRY/CATCH FOR COMPONENTS (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 React error boundaries are not simply `try/catch` blocks for
components, but a declarative way to handle errors within the UI.
Error boundaries, implemented as class components, catch errors during
rendering, lifecycle methods, and constructors, displaying fallback
UIs instead of crashing the app. However, they don't catch errors in
event handlers or asynchronous code, which means that methods like
`react-error-boundary` are needed to surface these errors.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HUMAN CODERS ARE STILL BETTER THAN LLMS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This dev had an experience fixing a complex bug in Redis using Vector
Sets and compared their problem-solving abilities to those of Gemini
2.5 Pro. While the LLM provided some helpful suggestions, the dev
ended up coming up with a more creative and efficient solution
involving a fixed accumulator and murmur-128 hashing to detect
corrupted links. Human creativity and out-of-the-box thinking are
still better than LLMs for complex problem-solving. 

 MY WEBSITE IS UGLY BECAUSE I MADE IT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The "ugliness" of this dev's website is what makes it uniquely
theirs. They designed the site with chaotic elements and
unconventional CSS tricks to achieve a "used bookstore" feel,
prioritizing personal expression over conventional aesthetics.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REDWOODSDK (WEBSITE) [8] 

 RedwoodSDK is a React framework for building server-side web
applications on Cloudflare. It has a standards-based router with
middleware and interruptors for controlling requests and responses. It
also provides built-in integration with Cloudflare services like D1,
R2, and Workers, along with local emulation through Miniflare. 

 FORESIGHTJS (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 ForesightJS is a JavaScript library that improves website performance
by predicting user intent through mouse movement analysis. It does
data prefetching before clicks or hovers to reduce unnecessary
prefetch requests and improve perceived loading speed. 

 ANNOUNCING ANGULAR V20 (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Angular v20 has been released. This release stabilizes reactivity
APIs like effect and toSignal, improves debugging with Angular
DevTools and Chrome DevTools integration, and improves the developer
experience with style guide updates and language service support. New
experimental APIs, such as resource streaming and httpResource, are
introduced for managing asynchronous state.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY DID MICROSOFT-BACKED $1.3BN BUILDER.AI COLLAPSE? ACCUSED OF USING
INDIAN CODERS FOR 'AI' WORK (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Builder.ai was a startup valued at $1.3 billion and backed by
Microsoft. It collapsed in May after being accused of misleading
investors by overstating its AI capabilities and relying primarily on
Indian coders behind the scenes. The company's business model, which
promised AI-driven app development for non-engineers, was revealed to
be largely a marketing gimmick, leading to inflated revenue
projections and unsustainable expansion. 

 LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS CAN RUN TOOLS IN YOUR TERMINAL WITH LLM 0.26
(13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 LLM 0.26 introduces support for tools, allowing LLMs to access
external functionalities via the LLM CLI tool and Python library.
These tools are accessible through plugins or ad-hoc Python functions.
This addition allows for the creation of "agents" by enabling tools in
a loop. 

 GETTING A CEASE AND DESIST FROM WAFFLE HOUSE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 During a hurricane in 2024, this dev reverse-engineered the Waffle
House website to create an unofficial "Waffle House Index" map
tracking restaurant closures as an indicator of disaster severity. The
website unexpectedly gained traction, catching the attention of Waffle
House's corporate team and even political commentators. Waffle House
requested the author to cease and desist due to trademark
infringement.
