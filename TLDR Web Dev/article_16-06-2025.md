ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THINGS TO AVOID IN JAVASCRIPT (11 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 JavaScript devs should avoid common pitfalls that can lead to bugs
and reliability issues. Important things to avoid include using
`innerHTML` for setting text, relying on `JSON.stringify()` for object
cloning, overusing regular objects as associative arrays, and
utilizing `eval()` for code execution. 

 USE ASYNC LOCAL STORAGE TO PREVENT PROPS DRILLING IN NEXT.JS ROUTE
HANDLERS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Async Local Storage acts like React Context but for Node.js, storing
data accessible within the same execution context. It can be used to
pass a user object through multiple functions easily. The code
provided uses `userContext.run()` to wrap functions needing access.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE CASE FOR SOFTWARE CRAFTSMANSHIP IN THE ERA OF VIBES (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The increased accessibility of code generation through AI should
elevate the standard for software quality, not just quantity. System
design and taking ownership of the user experience is even more
important now. 

 LESSONS FROM 9 MORE YEARS OF TRICKY BUGS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In this developer's nine years of tricky bugs, common coding errors
involved empty cases, date-related logic, data format upgrades, and
aliased dictionaries. Good testing had exploratory methods, smaller
test environments, and accounted for varied access rights. Debugging
relied on detailed logging, collaboration, alerting systems, and
reproducing issues with minimal examples.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SHIP DELIGHTFUL INBOXES, NOTIFICATION FEEDS, AND LIFECYCLE MESSAGES
INSIDE YOUR APP (SPONSOR) [8] 

 Knock is the complete toolkit for in-product messaging [8] with
drop-in React components and realtime stateful APIs. It's used by
companies you use everyday: Vercel, Zapier, Webflow. It's got
everything you need for best-in-class notifications that actually
feels native to your product. It's free for 10k notifications/mo. Get
started [8] 

 AMAZINGPRINT (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 AmazingPrint is a Ruby gem that provides customizable, colorized
pretty-printing of Ruby objects with proper indentation, including
support for Rails and IRB/PRY integration. 

 WILDCAT (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Wildcat is a high-performance, open-source, embedded key-value
database engine written in Go with C interoperability. It has a
log-structured merge tree architecture, multi-version concurrency
control, ACID transactions, and various iteration and configuration
options for optimal read/write performance and durability.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CAN AI REBUILD A RAILS PAGE IN NEXT.JS? WE TRIED IT (3 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 These developers attempted to rebuild a page from an internal Rails
app using Cursor with different LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude 4).
After three attempts with varying degrees of success, the LLMs almost
completed the task, missing only a simple "use client" directive to
make it fully functional. 

 SOURCE CODE SANDBOXING (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 It's easier than expected to implement source code sandboxing, which
limits a program's access to system resources, across various
operating systems and languages in 2025. This article goes over tools
like seccomp, landlock, seatbelt, Capsicum, pledge, JSM, secmodel, and
privileges, analyzing the complexity of their documentation and
implementation through code examples and a case study of OpenSSH. The
findings suggest OpenBSD's pledge has seen the most success due to its
simplicity, while Linux's seccomp is considerably more complex.

QUICK LINKS

 GOOGLE CLOUD SERVICE HEALTH (15 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A faulty code deployment triggered by an invalid automated quota
update caused a widespread Google Cloud and Workspace service
disruption with API request errors across multiple regions on June 12.


 MCP INDEX (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The MCP Index repository provides a curated list of MCP servers,
giving AI applications access to many tools and data sources across
categories like official servers, web search, browser automation,
memory management, weather and location, Git workflow, and business
tools. 

 TIP: PUT YOUR RAILS APP ON A SQL QUERY DIET (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 To improve Rails application performance, minimize SQL query count by
monitoring queries, eliminating unnecessary and duplicate queries,
consolidating data access, and focusing on retrieving only the data
needed for client application use cases. 

 ONE MORE REASON TO CHOOSE POSTGRES OVER MYSQL (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A big advantage of Postgres over MySQL is Transactional DDL, which
allows database schema changes within a single, reversible
transaction.
