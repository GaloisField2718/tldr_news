ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 MICROBENCHMARKS ARE EXPERIMENTS (15 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A benchmark comparing Dart and JavaScript code initially showed
JavaScript as faster, but this discrepancy was resolved by making sure
equivalent data structures (Int64List in Dart) were used. Further
investigation revealed that Dart's interrupt checks impacted
performance negatively, while JavaScriptCore's optimizations,
including modulo strength reduction, contributed to its speed
advantage, which was negated by one-line code change in Dart that took
advantage of Dart's compiler. 

 HOW LINKEDIN SCALED THEIR SYSTEM TO 5 MILLION QUERIES PER SECOND (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 LinkedIn scaled its restriction enforcement system to handle 5
million queries per second using a multi-faceted approach. It used
BitSets for efficient boolean storage and Bloom Filters for
probabilistic set membership checks. Its final architecture
incorporated a Venice database as the central source of truth, Kafka
for near real-time updates, and a client layer utilizing a REST API. 

 BUILDING REDDIT'S FRONTEND WITH VITE (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Reddit was experiencing slow Rollup-based frontend build times,
averaging nearly two minutes for initial builds and 40 seconds for
incremental ones. To address this, it adopted Vite, a build tool using
ESBuild's JIT compilation. The migration resulted in build times under
one second for both initial and incremental builds.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO BURNOUT A SOFTWARE ENGINEER, IN 3 EASY STEPS (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Burnout isn't always caused by working long hours. Often, it's caused
by deeper issues during engineering. This author tells two stories
about burning out in the same way at both a startup and a big tech
company. The burnout was caused by micromanagement, a lack of trust in
engineers, the introduction of unnecessary processes, not shipping
code to customers, and overpromising. 

 7 QUESTIONS I GET ASKED FREQUENTLY AS AN EM (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This engineering manager usually gets questions about project
timelines, team performance (including metrics like MTTR and KTLO
costs), and the impact of projects on key performance indicators. In
this post, he provides practical advice on using project management
tools, operational metrics dashboards, and BI tools to gather
information quickly and efficiently.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SCREEN SHARING (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Screen Sharing is a real-time screen-sharing application built with
Next.js, WebRTC, and PeerJS. It has room-based sharing, cross-browser
support, and a simple interface. 

 VINCE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Vince is a self-hosted, privacy-friendly alternative to Google
Analytics that offers features like automatic TLS, outbound link
tracking, and unlimited sites and events. 

 LITDB (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 LitDB is a TypeScript/JavaScript library that provides type-safe,
parameterized SQL builders for SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. It lets
developers write familiar SQL with better safety and portability. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 WEAPONIZING SSO FOR PROFIT (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Many SaaS vendors are charging extra for Single Sign-On (SSO), which
is increasingly mandated by regulations like NIS2 and DORA. This
practice forces companies, particularly regulated ones, into higher,
more expensive pricing tiers to meet security and compliance
requirements, despite SSO's relatively low implementation cost. 

 DESIGNING (AND EVOLVING) A NEW WEB PERFORMANCE SCORE (11 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 CrRRUX is a relative-ranking score designed to simplify competitor
analysis by aggregating Core Web Vitals data (LCP, INP, and CLS) into
a single comparative score. The score accounts for “passingness”,
continuity, and real user experiences. It can be automated through
Google Sheets and the CrUX API. 

 STRUCTURED EDITING AND INCREMENTAL PARSING (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Structured editing is a method where code editors understand a
program's syntax, offering benefits like instant feedback and accurate
selections. Structured editors often restrict non-structural editing,
which frustrates many programmers who frequently edit code in ways
that violate its syntax. A solution to this is incremental parsing,
which allows for both structured understanding and free-form editing
by maintaining a parse tree in the background, even if the code
becomes temporarily invalid.

QUICK LINKS

 HOW MUCH MEMORY DO YOU NEED IN 2024 TO RUN 1 MILLION CONCURRENT
TASKS? (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A 2024 benchmark comparing memory usage across various programming
languages while running one million concurrent tasks showed C# (with
NativeAOT) to be the most memory-efficient, followed closely by Rust,
while Go performed significantly worse than expected. 

 HETZNER CUTS TRAFFIC ON US VPSS, RAISES PRICES (HACKER NEWS THREAD)
[16] 

 Hetzner is reducing included data traffic and raising prices for its
US-based virtual private servers (VPS), effective December 1, due to a
need to balance costs based on regional conditions. 

 INTRODUCING SOME CHANGES TO OUR WEB API (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Spotify is making changes to its Web API that will affect
functionalities like related artists, recommendations, and audio
analysis.
