 👋 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [4] AI-native service provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA
cycle to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks [4]—not years
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs [4]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata [5] achieved 4x more test cases and 86% faster QA
cycles.

⭐ Rated 4.8/5 on G2.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO BUILD A CODING AGENT: FREE WORKSHOP (27 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Building a coding agent is surprisingly simple. It requires only
around 300 lines of code and a loop with LLM tokens. 

 DYNAMICALLY PATCH A PYTHON FUNCTION'S SOURCE CODE AT RUNTIME (12
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Python functions can be dynamically patched at runtime using
`compile` and `exec` for building flexible AI bots. This can be used
to generate and execute code with access to the current environment,
enabling useful functionalities such as manipulating dataframes
without pre-defined tools. However, this also has security risks, as
malicious LLM outputs could harm the system. 

🧠 

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MATERIALIZED VIEWS ARE OBVIOUSLY USEFUL (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Maintaining derived data, like task counts per project, is a common
problem and often has complexities that arise when using caching and
manual updates. Instead, "incremental view maintenance" or
"differential dataflow" is a better solution. This approach involves
defining desired data transformations with SQL, after which the system
automatically keeps the results up-to-date. 

 TURNING CLAUDE CODE INTO MY BEST DESIGN PARTNER (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Claude Code can be used as a design partner by creating an initial
plan document, which serves as the single source of truth. The plan is
a "living document," so it's constantly updated as the design gets
updated, creating a collaborative design process. 

 EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT GOOD API DESIGN (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 When designing good APIs, avoid breaking existing code and use
versioning for necessary changes. The success of an API heavily relies
on the product it supports, and a poorly designed product can ruin API
elegance.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FREE COURSE: TECHNICAL DIAGRAMMING, AI WORKFLOWS, AND MORE (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 Better diagramming can be your secret weapon to boost productivity.
Learn technical diagramming, Agile integrations with Jira/Azure,
AI-powered workflows, how to run better retrospectives, and much more
in Miro Academy's curated video course [11] — designed
specifically for engineering teams. Free and ungated [11] 

 UNLOCKING RICH UI COMPONENT RENDERING IN AI RESPONSES (8 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 react-markdown-with-mdx is a library that renders rich UI components
within LLM-generated markdown using JSX. This HOC wrapper improves
react-markdown to safely support JSX component tags in markdown,
validating attributes with Zod. By allowing LLMs to generate JSX tags,
developers can embed framework-native React components directly into
AI-generated text, creating a more visually engaging and interactive
UI. 

 SIDEQUEST (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Sidequest is a modern, TypeScript-based background job processor for
Node.js applications. It has features like worker threads, multiple
database backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL), ESM/CJS support,
and a web dashboard for monitoring.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT MAKES CLAUDE CODE SO DAMN GOOD (AND HOW TO RECREATE THAT MAGIC
IN YOUR AGENT)!? (15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Claude Code is good because it's simple. It has a single main loop,
simple search, and clear task management. Smaller models are great for
simple tasks like parsing and summarizing, and using techniques like
`claude.md` files, XML tags, and Markdown improve the outputs of
Claude Code. 

 HOW I MADE MY ONLINE GAME WORK WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT AND WHY YOU
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This dev built an online board game website with fully optional
JavaScript. They used server-side rendering with SvelteKit, standard
HTML elements like `summary` and `details` for interactive components,
and URL parameters for managing UI state. To mimic real-time updates
without WebSockets, they used the auto-refresh meta-tag.

QUICK LINKS

 MAKING GAMES IN GO: 3 MONTHS WITHOUT LLMS VS. 3 DAYS WITH LLMS (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 LLMs have made a 3-month game creation effort that takes just 3 days.


 AI-POWERED PROTOTYPING WITH DESIGN SYSTEMS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI-native design systems, like shadcn/ui, can be used to generate
on-brand, production-ready prototypes by having open, composable
components, token-based styling, and a registry for scaling and
contextualizing design elements. 

 RESERVE FIRST (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Exception safety bugs in memory management code can be prevented by
reserving memory before modifying data structures to avoid data
corruption during allocation failures.
