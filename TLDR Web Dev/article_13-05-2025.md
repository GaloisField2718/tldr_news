 HOW BROKEN OTPS AND OPEN ENDPOINTS TURNED A DATING APP INTO A
STALKER'S PLAYGROUND (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 There were critical vulnerabilities in the Cerca dating app that
exposed sensitive user data like personal messages, passport
information, and sexual preferences. Using simple techniques, this
developer found an OTP bypass and unprotected API endpoints, allowing
for complete account takeover and mass data extraction. The
vulnerabilities were later patched.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO TITLE YOUR BLOG POST OR WHATEVER (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Think of the title of a blog post you write as a "classifier"
designed to attract readers who will genuinely appreciate the content
and deter those who won't. Titles should give a strong signal to the
intended audience that the content is specifically for them, even if
it alienates a broader audience. 

 4 WAYS I USE AI AS AN ACCESSIBILITY SPECIALIST (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An accessibility specialist at Shopify uses AI in four ways: to write
accessibility issue tickets, automate testing for common WCAG
violations, for accessibility audits and compliance reporting across
Shopify surfaces, and to implement accessibility fixes more quickly
with coding assistants like Cursor.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING CLERK BILLING (SPONSOR) [8] 

 Set up subscriptions in your B2B or B2C app without writing custom
payment code or building your own UI. Use Clerk to define plans,
manage billing, and connect it directly to your existing
authentication setup. Enable Billing, drop in `PricingTable` on your
/pricing page. Start Building [9]. 

 NODE V24.0.0 (WEBSITE) [10] 

 Node.js v24 is here. It comes with the latest V8 engine, which lets
you do explicit resource management with the new using keyword. It
also has a new stable permission model (out of experimental in v20),
and the URLPattern API is now a global object. 

 BIPPY (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Bippy is a toolkit that bypasses React's restrictions to access its
internal fiber tree and other internals by mimicking React DevTools.
This lets devs inspect and manipulate React components without
modifying React code.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CAN YOU REALLY TRUST THAT PERMISSION POP-UP ON MACOS?
(CVE-2025-31250) (21 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A macOS vulnerability allowed malicious applications to spoof
permission prompts, making them appear to originate from a different
application than the one actually receiving the granted permissions.
This flaw was within the TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control)
system, specifically in how it handled Apple Events permissions. By
crafting a malicious XPC message, an attacker could manipulate the
user interface to display a misleading prompt while applying the
user's response to a different application. 

 Q&A WITH JASON PRUET (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory's National Security AI
Office believes AI is a disruptive force reshaping science and
security. Government investment in AI infrastructure is necessary for
public benefit and national competitiveness. Large AI models will have
a huge impact, and scientists should embrace AI as a fundamental shift
in problem-solving and discovery. 

 PASSKEYS FOR NORMAL PEOPLE (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Passkeys are a phishing-resistant alternative to passwords and OTPs
for authentication. They can be stored on devices or in password
managers like 1Password. Physical security keys (U2F) are an extra
layer of security on top.

 Codigo is a repository for programming languages, providing news,
rankings, and information about various languages like Python, Java,

 REDIS IS OPEN SOURCE AGAIN. BUT IS IT TOO LATE? (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 After a period of proprietary licensing that led to the Valkey fork,
Redis is open source again with version 8 under AGPLv3, but its
reputation and the adoption of Valkey may make it difficult to regain
the community's trust and user base.
