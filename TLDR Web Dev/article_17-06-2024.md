 COLLABORATING ON APIS IS EASIER WITH POSTMAN (SPONSOR) [4] 

 For dev teams relying on APIs, collaboration is crucial. To ship
better software, API producers and consumers need to share, discover,
and reuse high-quality API assets.

Luckily, Postman Collections [5] and workspaces [6] have
revolutionized the experience of collaborative API development.¬†

Used together, they enable API design, testing, and documentation
while providing a shared canvas for collaborating on API assets.¬†

Learn how companies like Cvent [7], Visma [8], Built Technologies [9],
and Amadeus [10] are using Postman to collaborate more easily and
deliver better APIs‚Äîfaster.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE STORY OF REFORMATTING 100K FILES AT GOOGLE IN 2012 (6 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 In 2012, Google embarked on a project to reformat all Bazel BUILD
files, which was tough because of inconsistent formatting and a
variety of developer preferences. A new tool called Buildifier, which
strictly enforced a unified style, was developed to automate this
process. The rollout was successful - it allowed for better code
maintenance and enabled large-scale changes that were previously
considered impossible. 

 DEMYSTIFYING INP: NEW TOOLS AND ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS (12 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a Core Web Vital metric that
measures the time it takes for a web page to respond to user
interaction. It can be optimized by minimizing JavaScript execution
time, shortening event handler duration, and reducing the amount of
DOM that needs to be re-rendered. 

 HOW GITHUB REBUILT THEIR PUSH PROCESSING SYSTEM (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GitHub revamped its code push handling system by transitioning from a
single monolithic job to a decoupled architecture using Apache Kafka.
This change involved breaking down the original large job into
smaller, independent tasks based on dependencies and ownership. They
improved reliability by enabling targeted retries and reduced latency
by allowing parallel processing.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GOOD CODE IS RARELY READ (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Good code should prioritize ease of use over readability. It should
be intuitive and self-explanatory and shouldn't require much reading
to understand its purpose and functionality. 

 GEN AI WILL INCREASE DEMAND FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 This author believes that generative AI will increase demand for
software engineers. He compares it to autopilot systems on airplanes
which made piloting more accessible and grew the aviation industry,
leading to increased demand and higher salaries for pilots. While the
specific skillset required for software engineers might change due to
generative AI, general skills like communication, problem-solving, and
creativity will remain and be even more important. 

 WHY STRUCTURE AND INTERPRETATION OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS MATTERS (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The textbook, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
(SICP), revolutionized introductory computer science education by
focusing on big-picture ideas like abstraction and functions as data,
rather than just programming language details. It chose Scheme as the
teaching language, which allowed students to grasp concepts without
getting bogged down in syntax. SICP set a high bar for student
expectations, challenging them with complex tasks like building
interpreters. The SICP course has been very popular at UC Berkeley and
has served well in educating computer science students that do well in
industry and graduate school.
