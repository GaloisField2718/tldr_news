ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THIS AI AGENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SQL QUERY (19 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Building AI Agents as streaming SQL queries can be done using
platforms like Apache Flink. This approach can offer consistency,
scalability, and a better developer experience, similar to how
microservices can be implemented as SQL queries. Flink's ability to
interact with LLMs, its event-driven architecture, and its capacity to
manage context through features like lookup joins and
retrieval-augmented generation makes it great for building agentic
systems. 

 REACTIVITY IS EASY (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This post goes through a simple, elegant solution for fine-grained
selector-based reactivity, achieving targeted re-renders using a
simple store and `useSelector` hook. It avoids unnecessary re-renders
of components by subscribing them to specific slices of state.
Furthermore, `use-sync-external-store` can be used for React
edge-cases, ergonomic store updates, and memoized selectors for
derived state.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WRITING DOCUMENTATION FOR AI: BEST PRACTICES (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI systems process documentation in chunks, relying on content
matching and explicit connections, so documentation should be
self-contained and contextually complete. To optimize content for AI,
use semantic HTML, prefer HTML or Markdown over PDFs, create
crawler-friendly content, have semantic clarity with descriptive
headings and URLs, and provide text equivalents for visuals. 

 IS THERE A HALF-LIFE FOR THE SUCCESS RATES OF AI AGENTS? (16 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 AI agent performance can be characterized by a "half-life" related to
human task completion time. There is an observed exponential decline
in success rates with task length and the model proposed in this
article allows for predictions of success rates at different task
lengths and improvement over time.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LSTR (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 lstr is a fast, minimalist directory tree viewer written in Rust. It
has both classic and interactive TUI modes with features like Git
integration, smart filtering, and customizable display options. 

 SCRAPPY: MAKE LITTLE APPS FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS (20 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Scrappy is a prototype tool for creating personalized, easily-shared
apps for small groups of friends and family. It has a simple
development environment inspired by canvas-based tools and "media with
scripting" environments. 

 NPMGRAPH (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 npmgraph is a tool for visualizing npm modules and their
dependencies. It allows users to explore module relationships and can
be configured using URL parameters to customize the graph's appearance
and content, such as colorization, dependency types, and module
selection.

 ANDREJ KARPATHY'S YC AI SUS TALK (40 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Andrej Karpathy's recent YCombinator talk focused on the evolution of
software and introduced the concept of Software 3.0, where programs
are written in natural language and program people. He drew parallels
between LLMs and operating systems - both have a utility-like nature.
Moving forward, devs should build infrastructure that caters to LLMs
as agents, where software is rewritten for both professionals and
non-professionals alike. 

 2025 STATE OF AI CODE QUALITY (23 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 According to a 2025 Qodo report, AI coding tools are widely adopted
by developers, with 82% using them daily or weekly. However, one of
the main challenges they face is the lack of contextual awareness in
AI suggestions. AI's impact on code quality and developer satisfaction
rises a lot when productivity is coupled with automated review and
increased confidence in the AI's output. 

 HOW JAVASCRIPT WAS WRITTEN BACK IN THE DAY (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 JavaScript was written in the past (2006-2015) with frameworks like
jQuery and Backbone.js. Devs came up with creative solutions to
overcome browser inconsistencies and language limitations before
modern JavaScript features like `fetch()` and `Object.assign()`. For
example, jQuery used clever tricks like method chaining with
`$('#element').addClass('active').fadeIn()` and `[].push.apply(this,
num)` to make jQuery objects behave like arrays.

 SAM ALTMAN SAYS META TRIED AND FAILED TO POACH OPENAI'S TALENT WITH
$100M OFFERS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sam Altman revealed that Meta unsuccessfully attempted to recruit
OpenAI's top talent with offers of up to $100 million. 

 MY IPHONE 8 REFUSES TO DIE: NOW IT'S A SOLAR-POWERED VISION OCR
SERVER (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 An old iPhone 8 was repurposed into a solar-powered, off-grid Vision
OCR server using Apple's native framework and an EcoFlow River 2 Pro. 

 PERFORMANCE AND STRESS TESTING IN NODE.JS (14 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 It's important to perform performance and stress testing of Node.js
apps with tools like AutoCannon, Artillery, and k6. 

 A BETTER API FOR THE RESIZE OBSERVER (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article proposes a refactored and more user-friendly API for the
ResizeObserver, putting its functionality into a `resizeObserver`
function that takes an element and an optional callback to simplify
its usage.
