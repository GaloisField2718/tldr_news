 BEYOND ESIGNATURES: BUILDING NEXT-GEN APPLICATIONS FOR THE ENTIRE
AGREEMENT LIFECYCLE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 For many organizations, agreement data is trapped in static files,
making it difficult to access, update, or connect with systems. A
challenge called the Agreement Trap — resulting in an estimated $2
trillion lost in global economic value each year. 

To address this, Docusign's new Intelligent Agreement Management
platform [5] offers a modular approach that enables developers to
build scalable, tailored solutions across the entire agreement
lifecycle. This includes:

 	* APIS for end-to-end agreement management.
 	* EXTENSION APPS for bringing your own products into Docusign to
accelerate growth.
 	* MAESTRO, a no-code automation tool for creating and managing
complex agreement workflows.
 	* NAVIGATOR, an AI-powered digital repository to store and extract
data, delivering actionable insights.

Explore the full suite of tools and learn how to build smarter,
scalable agreement solutions. [4]

 HOW WE BUILT A SELF-HEALING SYSTEM TO SURVIVE A TERRIFYING
CONCURRENCY BUG AT NETFLIX (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A concurrency bug in a Netflix internal library was causing CPUs to
die at a rate of one every two minutes. Due to the bug being unfixable
until Monday, Netflix engineers implemented a self-healing system by
pinning their cluster size to the maximum and randomly terminating a
few instances every 15 minutes. This let the system stay running until
Monday when it could be fixed. 

 ADOPTING BAZEL FOR WEB AT SCALE (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Airbnb migrated its large-scale web monorepo to Bazel, Google's
open-source build tool, to overcome scaling limitations and
inefficiencies in its existing build system. The migration process
involved preparing the codebase for Bazel, which involved cycle
breaking and automating BUILD.bazel file generation, and then
migrating CI jobs to Bazel. 

 REACT IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, AND ITS RULES ARE SYNTAX (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Refs, which are used to reference DOM nodes, don't work in React
Server Components. This limitation stems from the fact that the server
doesn't have access to the DOM, which is a browser-specific concept.
Allowing refs in Server Components would introduce potential issues
with lexical scope and UI consistency.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE MAGIC OF KEEPING ONE LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION PER FUNCTION (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 It's important to maintain a single level of abstraction per function
in code. Mixing different levels of detail within a single function
can lead to confusion and make code harder to understand. Break down
code into smaller, focused functions so that each function addresses a
specific task at a consistent level of abstraction. 

 WHAT ARE SOME PAST "FAD" FIELDS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE THAT DIDN'T AGE
WELL? (REDDIT THREAD) [10] 

 Past fads in computer science include Java applets, SOAP, and XML.
NoSQL and code generation tools have stuck around, but were initially
overly hyped.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 IF YOU'RE TESTING <80% OF USER FLOWS BEFORE SHIPPING, YOU'VE GOT A
BUGS-SNEAKING-OUT PROBLEM (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Getting to 80% test coverage with traditional QA is a slog… so
don't do it. In just 4 months, QA Wolf's AI-native service [12]
automates hundreds / thousands of tests, ready to run in the QA Wolf
cloud on every deploy. The Playwright / Appium code stays yours. Learn
about their 90 day pilot [11] 

 EXPO SDK 52 (26 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Expo SDK 52 has been released. The New Architecture has been enabled
by default for all newly created projects. The release includes React
Native 0.76, a stable release of the new expo-video library, beta
releases of expo-audio and expo-file-system/next, and large updates to
other packages. 

 HYPERDX (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 HyperDX is an open-source observability platform that allows
engineers to quickly diagnose production issues by providing a unified
search and visualization interface for logs and traces from any
Clickhouse cluster. 

 INTRODUCING SPIN 3.0 (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Spin is an open-source developer tool for building and running
serverless WebAssembly applications. Its latest release includes new
features like component dependencies and selective deployments.

 THINKING ABOUT RECIPE FORMATS MORE THAN ANYONE SHOULD (6 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 This developer considered Cooklang, a recipe markup language, and the
Recipe Schema Type, a JSON-LD format used by large recipe sites, for
his own recipe site. Cooklang is more simple and flexible, but Schema
Type has benefits for SEO and recipe extraction. The developer decided
to use a combination of both, rendering Cooklang recipes on his
website, providing the raw Cooklang content for download, including
the Schema Type for extractors, and using the h-recipe microformat for
better semantic markup. 

 WHAT IS THE BEST REACT NATIVE LIST COMPONENT? (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 ScrollView in React Native for large datasets has limitations
compared to FlatList and SectionList as built-in solutions. FlashList
is a new type of list built by Shopify that has 5x-10x faster
performance compared to FlatList. It uses an optimized
RecyclerListView that provides near-native list performance.
