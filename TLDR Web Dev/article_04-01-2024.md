 HOW DISCORD MODERNIZED MFA WITH WEBAUTHN (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This post discusses how Discord modernized its Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) with WebAuthn. WebAuthn provides a non-phishable,
non-guessable, and user-friendly form of authentication. The switch to
WebAuthn solved issues with Discord‚Äôs legacy MFA system by
integrating with a new authentication flow (MFAv2), which addressed
many existing issues in UX, architecture, and platform support. 

 A GLIMPSE INTO TAX CALCULATIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Etsy uses a Quotation Request API to handle tax calculations for its
marketplace and determine tax based on buyer and seller location,
product category, and tax rules. It has a map of its product
categories to tax categories. Etsy faced the challenge of increased
API traffic and handled it by using multiple instances for the API
calls and implementing shadow logging for stress testing.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY AND HAPPINESS FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAMS
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LinkedIn‚Äôs Developer Productivity & Happiness Framework (DPH) is a
collection of documents that describe the systems, processes, metrics,
and feedback systems used to understand developers and their needs
internally at LinkedIn. The framework starts off by attempting to
answer the question, ‚ÄúHow do I choose what to measure?‚Äù. Next,
LinkedIn creates Developer Personas, which categorizes developers into
different groups based on their workflows. The company thinks about
priorities separately for each of those groups, with different data
and metrics collected for each. This data is used to improve developer
and team productivity and happiness. 

 THINK MORE ABOUT WHAT TO FOCUS ON (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There is a trade-off between exploring new options and exploiting
known ones. It‚Äôs important to do both exploration and exploitation
in life, as focus and prioritization can lead to greater achievements
and richness in life.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SSH3 (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 SSH3 is a redesigned version of the SSH protocol that offers faster
session establishment, new authentication methods like OAuth 2.0 and
OpenID Connect, enhanced security against port scanning attacks,
support for UDP port forwarding, and access to modern QUIC protocol
features. 

 TERMINAL SUNDAY (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Terminal Sunday provides a graphical view of one's lifespan. It shows
the amount of Sundays left in one‚Äôs life as both a number and a
visual in Terminal.

 THE END OF FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 While concerns around AI replacing front-end development are common,
it‚Äôs more likely that AI will actually accelerate the need for
software in general. This will lead to more software developers
overall and change the way developers work. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs
important to use AI tools like GPT-4 while working to see how they can
fit into your workflow without using them as a replacement for
understanding your code. 

 MAKING SMALL GAMES, WHICH IS FUN IN ITSELF (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This author has created over 350 small games that can be concluded
within 10 minutes and easily played on browsers. It allows for quick
experimentation with various ideas and for beginner developers to work
their way up to tackling larger, longer-term projects. When making
good small games, it‚Äôs important to fulfill promises to the user,
minimize unnecessary elements, and focus on the enjoyment of the
creative process.

QUICK LINKS

 UNDERSTANDING THE TYPES OF JAVASCRIPT ERRORS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Common JavaScript errors include syntax errors, reference errors,
type errors, range errors, URI errors, internal errors, and the now
deprecated eval errors. 

 WHAT SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS USING CHATGPT CAN TELL US ABOUT HOW IT'S
CHANGING WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI chatbots help assist in tasks such as generating code, finding
information quickly, and optimizing code efficiency. Developers use
chatbots to streamline their work processes and save time, allowing
them to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their projects. 

 BENCHMARKING 20 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES ON N-QUEENS AND MATRIX
MULTIPLICATION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 The fastest languages are V+, C, and Rust. The slowest are Ruby,
Perl, and CPython. 

 OPENVOICE (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Easy, instant voice cloning done locally, with various settings to
tune.
