ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING A HIGHLY-AVAILABLE WEB SERVICE WITHOUT A DATABASE (12 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 This blog post shows off a novel web dev architecture that removes
the need for a separate database. It uses in-memory data storage,
periodic snapshots, and transaction logs for high availability. The
author details how the Raft Consensus Protocol can be integrated to
achieve 99.999% availability, making it suitable even for demanding
enterprise clients. 

 BUILD YOUR OWN REACT STATE MANAGEMENT LIBRARY IN UNDER 40 LINES OF
CODE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article explains how to create a simple React state management
library using the `useSyncExternalStore` hook introduced in React 18.
It outlines the key components of the library, including subscribing
to state changes, retrieving the current state, and updating the
state. The article also compares this approach to using React Context
and discusses potential improvements like using reducers and immer for
state management. 

 WHY YOUR DATA STACK WON'T LAST - AND HOW TO BUILD DATA INFRASTRUCTURE
THAT WILL (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Data infrastructure projects are often quickly replaced and difficult
to maintain. To prevent this, it's important to avoid "resume-driven
development," where teams prioritize trendy technologies over
practical needs, and the "key person dependency" problem, where only
one person has all the knowledge of a system.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 PROGRAMMERS SHOULD NEVER TRUST ANYONE, NOT EVEN THEMSELVES (9 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Programmers should embrace a mindset of skepticism and constant
verification, as trusting abstractions can lead to unexpected
problems. Abstractions, while necessary for efficient thinking, are
often leaky and can fail in unpredictable ways, so it's important to
understand the underlying mechanisms. That's why "trust, but verify‚Äù
is necessary when working on a project with a lot of abstractions. 

 MICROFRONTENDS SHOULD BE YOUR LAST RESORT (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Microfrontends (MFEs) are often touted as a solution for large,
complex front-end applications, but they should be a last resort.
While MFEs can offer benefits like team independence and modularity,
they also introduce complexities like increased deployment overhead
and a distributed monolith if not implemented correctly. Before
adopting MFEs, prioritize refactoring your codebase and try starting
with a modular monolith first. 

 7 THINGS I'VE LEARNED BUILDING A MODERN TUI FRAMEWORK (13 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 While building a modern TUI (Terminal UI) framework, this author
found that it's important to have smooth animation in terminals,
achieved through techniques like overwriting instead of clearing,
single-write updates, and the Synchronized Output protocol. He also
advocates for DictViews for efficiently comparing data structures, and
lru_cache for improving performance by caching function results.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MITIGATING OAUTH'S RECENTLY DISCOVERED OPEN RESPONSE TYPE
VULNERABILITY (SPONSOR) [10] 

How Clerk mitigated the recently discovered Open Response Type
vulnerability. We dive into the technical details of the
vulnerability, why most customers were protected by default, and how
we mitigated the attack for the last few. 

 NOUS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Nous is an AI platform with advanced autonomous agents for complex
workflows, offering features like intelligent planning, flexible
function calling, LLM integrations, and human-in-the-loop
capabilities. 

 PG_REPLICATE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 pg_replicate is a Rust crate published by Supabase that simplifies
building data pipelines for replicating Postgres data to other systems
by providing high-level abstractions over Postgres's logical streaming
replication protocol.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW I CREATED 175 FONTS USING RUST (30 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This author created a massive 175-font pixel font megapack, using
Rust to build his own custom font generation toolchain. He aimed to
improve upon his previous packs by offering a wider range of styles
and language support, and implemented automatic kerning and quality
control measures to streamline the process. The author developed a
tool called pifo, which uses algorithms to analyze and generate
contours from pixel art, calculates kerning pairs, and exports the
fonts in various formats. 

 IMAGINING A PERSONAL DATA PIPELINE (23 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A personal data pipeline is a system to collect, manage, and utilize
personal data generated from various online services. This article
goes over an architecture to create this pipeline, made of Data
Getters, Processors, and Recipes, allowing users to extract,
transform, and combine data from different sources. 

 HOW THE SNES GRAPHICS SYSTEM WORKS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article goes into the four chips responsible for the SNES (Super
Nintendo Entertainment System) graphics system: the two Pixel
Processing Units (PPU1 and PPU2) and two SRAM chips. The PPU1 acts as
the brain, while the PPU2 acts as a compositor to display the visuals.
The article then discusses the different types of RAM used for storing
graphics data, including VRAM (which is designed uniquely), OAM, and
CGRAM.
