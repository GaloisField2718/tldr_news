 IMPLEMENTING MULTI-TENANCY INTO A NEXT.JS SUPABASE APP (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you're building something team-based—think workspaces, orgs, or
shared dashboards—you've probably bumped into the “how do I handle
multi-tenancy?” question.

Good news: Clerk just dropped a guide showing how to do this with
Supabase + Next.js using Postgres RLS. No custom auth hacks, no messy
logic.

In the guide, you'll see how to:

	* Set up org-based access with minimal config
	* Use Clerk's organizationSwitcher to manage context
	* Keep your database logic simple and secure with RLS
	* Avoid the usual headaches around auth and permissions

It's clear, practical, and you'll walk away with code you can actually
use.

👉 Read the guide. [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PROGRESSIVE JSON (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Most apps send JSON all at once, forcing the client to wait until
everything is ready, but what if we streamed it progressively, like
how progressive JPEGs load from blurry to clear? A "Progressive JSON"
approach is explored here that sends data breadth-first with
placeholders, letting the client process what's ready and treat
missing parts as Promises. This is similar to how React Server
Components stream UI and use Suspense to control visual loading
states. 

 VIRTUAL THREADS ATE MY MEMORY: A WEB CRAWLER'S TALE OF SPEED VS.
MEMORY (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Switching a web crawler from platform threads to Java Virtual Threads
improves speed, but also causes an OutOfMemoryError due to a lack of
built-in backpressure. Virtual Threads allows downloads to race ahead,
but without limits, the system quickly floods memory with unprocessed
tasks. The fix is to introduce explicit concurrency control (like
semaphores) to balance speed with memory. 

 CONCURRENT WEB CRAWLING IN RUBY WITH ASYNC (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article shows how to transform a slow, synchronous Ruby web
crawler into a fast concurrent one using the Async library. Crawling
time is reduced from 3 seconds to half a second in the example by
implementing non-blocking I/O with Fibers, connection reuse, and rate
limiting.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT'S WORKING FOR YC COMPANIES SINCE THE AI BOOM (8 MINUTE READ) [8]


 An analysis of YC companies from the four batches following the
ChatGPT launch shows a low Series A success rate (2.4%), though it is
too early to draw firm conclusions given the typical Seed-to-Series A
timeline. There's also a dominance of business automation/operational
tooling companies, surprisingly narrow "AI for X" verticals (mainly
legal/patent), and a prevalence of platform/API-first approaches. 

 WHEN FINE-TUNING ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE: A DEVELOPER'S GUIDE (8 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Fine-tuning helps solve specific, high-impact problems that prompting
alone can't, like inconsistent JSON output, bloated prompts, or models
that ignore custom logic or tone. It's especially valuable for
improving task-specific quality, reducing cost and latency, and making
smaller models smarter through training on targeted examples.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 KNOCK: INFRASTRUCTURE TO SEND PRODUCT MESSAGING (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Building, managing, and scaling cross-channel notifications gets
complicated fast. Knock [10] is a single API for managing messages
across email, in-app, Slack, push, and SMS. Plus, a visual workflow
builder and template editor anyone can use. All with observability,
like you built it in-house. Send 10k notifications per month for free
[10]. 

 MCP SERVER IN BASH (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 `mcp-server-bash-sdk` is a lightweight implementation of a Model
Context Protocol (MCP) server in Bash. It provides a zero-overhead
alternative to other MCP server implementations by using Bash and `jq`
for JSON processing. 

 CAP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Cap is a fast, lightweight, open-source CAPTCHA alternative that uses
SHA-256 proof-of-work instead of tracking or fingerprinting. It has a
tiny JavaScript widget, zero-dependency server, optional CLI,
Docker-based standalone mode, and middleware for frameworks like
Express, Hono, and Elysia.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ROOT SHELL ON CREDIT CARD TERMINAL (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This dev reverse-engineered a Worldline Yomani XR credit card
terminal and found it had surprisingly weak security despite hardware
tamper protections. He discovered a root shell accessible via a debug
port, even from outside the device without triggering tamper
detection. However, the vulnerable Linux system appears isolated from
the secure processor handling sensitive card data, which limits the
potential damage. 

 HOW GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (GEO) REWRITES THE RULES OF SEARCH
(8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is a new paradigm shifting from
traditional SEO's focus on page rank to language models and how
content is referenced in AI-generated answers. This new approach
prioritizes well-organized and meaningful content that language models
can easily extract and reproduce, requiring brands to optimize for
model relevance rather than just search engine rankings. 

 ESLINT V9.0.0: A RETROSPECTIVE (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 ESLint v9.0.0 was released in April 2024 with a new configuration
system, but its launch faced initial negative feedback from users due
to numerous breaking changes, such as the combination of the new
configuration system and rule API changes. While the ESLint team
provided documentation, users found it overwhelming and preferred
automated tooling for upgrades. The lessons learned include
prioritizing smaller, more frequent releases, focusing on tooling over
documentation, and improving error message context.

QUICK LINKS

 WHY ARE 2025/05/28 AND 2025-05-28 DIFFERENT DAYS IN JAVASCRIPT? (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 JavaScript interprets dates with the `/` separator as local time and
dates with the `-` separator as UTC, leading to different date
calculations due to browser parsing inconsistencies and historical
standards. 

 PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME: THE PRINCETON INTERCAL COMPILER'S
SOURCE CODE (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The original source code for the influential esoteric programming
language INTERCAL-72, created by Princeton undergraduates in 1972 and
known for its intentionally difficult and parodic design, has been
rediscovered, transcribed, and made publicly available. 

 CODEX CLI IS GOING NATIVE (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenAI is rewriting Codex CLI in Rust to improve cross-platform
stability, security, performance, and extensibility. 

 WHY DEEPSEEK IS CHEAP AT SCALE BUT EXPENSIVE TO RUN LOCALLY (12
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 DeepSeek-V3's architecture, like other Mixture-of-Experts models,
benefits from large batch sizes to efficiently utilize GPUs, making it
cost-effective at scale.
