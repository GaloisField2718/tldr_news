ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WE STUDIED 100 DEV TOOL LANDING PAGES—HERE'S WHAT REALLY WORKS IN
2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An analysis of 100+ developer tool landing pages found that
successful pages follow a consistent structure: hero section, trust
block, feature block, social proof, supporting blocks, and final CTA.
The research showed that great dev tool landing pages avoid flashy
interactions and focus on clean, centered layouts with clear
typography, while hero sections typically use centered composition
with either static or animated product UI screenshots. 

 BIG O (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Big O notation is a way to describe a function's performance by
showing how its execution time scales with the size of the input. This
article explains four common Big O notations: constant O(1),
logarithmic O(log n), linear O(n), and quadratic O(n^2), providing
examples for each. It then discusses practical coding scenarios, such
as finding items in lists, looping with indexes, and caching results,
to demonstrate how understanding Big O can optimize code. 

 AN ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO OAUTH (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OAuth allows third-party apps to access user data or perform actions
on behalf of a user without requiring the user's password. The process
involves redirecting the user to the authorization server (like
Chase), where they log in and grant specific permissions (scopes) to
the app (like YNAB). The authorization server then redirects the user
back to the app with an authorization code, which the app exchanges
for an access token via a secure back-end request. This access token
enables the app to access user data from the resource server, all
while keeping the user actively involved and in control of what data
is shared.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY I SWITCHED FROM CURSOR TO CLAUDE CODE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This dev switched from Cursor to Claude Code, finding that it feels
much better for real development work. He works with it by creating a
Claude.md file as onboarding documentation for the AI, following an
"Explore → Plan → Code" workflow instead of jumping straight to
implementation, and using features like custom slash commands and
screenshot sharing to maximize productivity. 

 HOW TO MAKE THINGS SLOWER SO THEY GO FASTER (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The problem of synchronized demand in computer systems is where many
clients request resources at the same time, leading to overload.
Jitter is a technique that introduces random delays to spread out
requests and prevent peaks. The optimal jitter window is determined by
balancing overload risk with added latency, considering factors like
system headroom, service time, and product requirements.
