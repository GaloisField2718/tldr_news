ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REVERSE ENGINEERING LINEAR'S SYNC ENGINE: A DETAILED STUDY (1 HOUR
READ) [4] 

 This document reverse-engineers Linear's Sync Engine (LSE). LSE uses
models defined with JavaScript classes and decorators, using MobX for
observability and a sophisticated bootstrapping and lazy loading
system. Client-side changes are sent as transactions to the server and
are managed using a transaction queue, with conflict resolution
handled using a "last-writer-wins" strategy. 

 ONE ROUNDTRIP PER NAVIGATION (20 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Navigating to a new page should ideally involve a single request to
fetch the necessary data. Client-side logic and component-based
architectures, while offering colocation of UI and data fetching,
often lead to inefficient multiple requests and client-server
waterfalls. Server Loaders centralize data fetching but sacrifice
colocation, while GraphQL and React Server Components (RSC) attempt to
achieve both colocation and single-round trip efficiency by composing
data dependencies or rendering components on the server. 

 WHAT A DEVELOPER NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT SCIM (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standard used
by identity providers to communicate user changes (additions, updates,
and removals) to other software. It makes integration easier by
standardizing JSON formats for CRUD operations between the identity
provider and the software application.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TRACK ERRORS FIRST (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Error tracking is the most valuable signal in observability, but is
often overshadowed by logs, metrics, and traces. Exceptions show that
programmer assumptions have failed, making them the most informative
events to track with detailed context. Errors should never be treated
as generic events. 

 I THINK I'M DONE THINKING ABOUT GENAI FOR NOW (28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The discourse around generative AI often avoids serious criticisms,
such as the demoralizing impact of it on software development.
However, because the technology is evolving so quickly, having a
consistent negative opinion on it is hard to maintain. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HYPERDX (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 HyperDX is an open-source observability platform built on ClickHouse
and OpenTelemetry. It helps engineers quickly diagnose production
issues by unifying logs, metrics, traces, session replays, and errors
into a single searchable and visualizable interface. 

 ELEVEN V3 (ALPHA) (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ElevenLabs' Eleven v3 (alpha) is a text-to-speech model that offers
world-class expressiveness and control through audio tags. This new
version supports dynamic conversations between multiple speakers with
shared context and emotions across over 70 languages. Users can now
control the emotion, delivery, and direction of the generated audio.

 ANTHROPIC CO-FOUNDER ON CUTTING ACCESS TO WINDSURF: 'IT WOULD BE ODD
FOR US TO SELL CLAUDE TO OPENAI' (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Anthropic cut Windsurf's access to its Claude AI models due to rumors
of OpenAI acquiring the AI coding assistant. According to Anthropic
co-founder Jared Kaplan, it would be "odd" to essentially sell Claude
to its main competitor. 

 THE SIGNALFIRE STATE OF TECH TALENT REPORT (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The SignalFire 2025 Talent Report shows large shifts in the tech
talent landscape, such as a sharp decline in new grad hiring and a
growing geographic distribution of tech talent. Entry-level hiring has
dropped a lot as companies prioritize experienced talent and
high-leverage technical roles. Elite AI labs like Anthropic are
dominating the talent race through high retention rates and strategic
poaching from competitors. 

 THE NO-NONSENSE APPROACH TO AI AGENT DEVELOPMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [13]


 AI agents are software systems that automate complex, multi-step
tasks. The process of developing them involves three key steps:
manually prototyping the agent to understand the task, automating the
loop by using code for deterministic steps and LLMs for judgment, and
optimizing for reliability through prompt refinement and structured
evaluations. Agents should start off with a narrow scope in order to
work well.

 GOOGLE RESTRICTS ANDROID SIDELOADING—WHAT IT MEANS FOR USER
AUTONOMY AND THE FUTURE OF MOBILE FREEDOM (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's increasing restrictions on Android sideloading, framed as
security measures, are raising concerns about user autonomy,
innovation, and competition. 

 OPENAI SLAMS COURT ORDER TO SAVE ALL CHATGPT LOGS, INCLUDING DELETED
CHATS (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI is contesting a court order to preserve all ChatGPT user logs,
including deleted chats, arguing it violates user privacy and
contractual obligations. 

 LLMS & ELIXIR: WINDFALL OR DEATHBLOW? (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Elixir community should embrace large language models (LLMs) as a
potential force multiplier by investing in tools and documentation
that allow LLMs to effectively work with Elixir. 

 API DOCUMENTATION - SCREEN TIME NETWORK (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Screen Time Network API allows users to access current and
historical screen time data and subscribe to screen time-related
events for themselves or public users.
