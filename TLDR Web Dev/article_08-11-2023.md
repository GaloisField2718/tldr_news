 TURN EVERY ENGINEER INTO A SUPERHERO (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Teams need alerting and incident management tools to respond to
incidents ‚Äì but today, they‚Äôre separate. What's more, the way we
build software continues to evolve and become more complex, but
alerting tools are still stuck in the past.
Introducing Signals by FireHydrant [5] a modern alerting tool that
helps you:

 	* LOWER COSTS and only pay for users who have actually been paged. 
 	* REDUCE NOISY ALERTS and only amplify the signals that require
incident response. 
 	* IMPROVE ASSEMBLY TIME by paging teams and services. 

It‚Äôs time to start thinking about the full incident lifecycle, from
ring to retro. Sign up [5] for Signals today.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WRITING A COMPILER IS SURPRISINGLY EASY (PART 1) (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article discusses the process of writing a code generator for a
systems programming language with a focus on translating a high-level
language into x86-64 assembly code. It explains how to represent
integer literals, variables, negation, and addition in the compiler
and provides code examples for each. 

 HOW WE REDUCED OUR DOCUMENTDB COST BY NEARLY 50% AND OPTIMIZED
PERFORMANCE (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The activity feed team at Postman investigated their DocumentDB usage
and was able to reduce the monthly cost from $6k to $3k with 50%
performance gains. They optimized their feed collation query, refined
their indexing strategy, shifted from TTL-based deletes to direct
deletes, and updated their collation strategy to use updates instead
of inserts and deletes. These changes led to significant reductions in
both read and write I/O operations and a 35% reduction in CPU
utilization. 

 REACT SERVER COMPONENTS, WITHOUT A FRAMEWORK? (30 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article explores React Server Components and React Server
Actions, clarifying key terms and concepts related to these features
and highlighting the experimental and under-documented nature of these
APIs. It shows how both can be used to address various challenges in
web development, such as data fetching, routing, latency, and more.
The article uses an example of migrating a React Notes App to React
Server Components without using a framework, showcasing the use of
React Canary, React Server & React Flight APIs, and other
dependencies.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 OH MY POOR BUSINESS LOGIC (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In large organizations, there is a tendency to focus on technical
minutiae and overcomplicate solutions rather than addressing core
business problems. There are two types of companies: the ones that
prioritize measurable business outcomes but accumulate technical debt,
and those that obsess over technical details and tools without
considering the business impact. Finding a middle ground where
developers can focus on core business logic without unnecessary
complexity is essential. 

 NAVIGATING CAREER ADVICE IN THE TECH INDUSTRY (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 It's crucial to be aware of survivorship bias when seeking advice in
the tech industry as individuals tend to believe their path is the
only path to success. The job market is constantly changing and what
worked in the past may not work today. Your experience will also vary
depending on factors like location and educational background.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 IMPROVE YOUR SEO FOR FREE WITH AHREFS WEBMASTER TOOLS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Google Search Console is great in some ways, but limited in others.
[11] Ahrefs is now offering a free tool [11] that lets you identify
140+ SEO issues, get an accurate picture of ALL backlinks [11], see
every keyword [11] that‚Äôs driving traffic to your site ‚Äî and how

 INSHELLISENSE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 inshellisense, made by Microsoft, provides IDE-style autocomplete for
shells. It's a terminal native runtime for autocomplete which has
support for 600+ command line tools. inshellisense supports Windows,
Linux, & macOS. 

 HOTKEY (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Hotkey allows the triggering of actions on target elements when
specific keys or key combinations are pressed on the keyboard. These
hotkeys can be scoped to form fields and are extracted from a target
element's data-hotkey attribute by default. GitHub uses hotkeys
extensively to declare shortcuts on its platform.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ARE LANGUAGE MODELS GOOD AT MAKING PREDICTIONS? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A recent experiment showed that GPT-4 is not well-calibrated in
predicting the probability of various events and questions, often
overestimating or underestimating probabilities. It also shows
variations in prediction quality across different categories, with
better performance in some areas like sports, and poorer performance
in others like personal questions. This suggests that GPT-4's
performance variations are not solely due to question difficulty but
also reflect differences in its ability to provide confident and
well-calibrated predictions across categories. 

 HOW TO WRITE COMPONENTS THAT WORK IN ANY FRAMEWORK (11 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Web Components that work in any framework consist of three key
technologies: Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML Templates. Custom
Elements allow you to define your own custom HTML elements that can be
reused across your site and even published for use by other
developers. Shadow DOM provides encapsulation, ensuring that the
styles and behavior of your custom elements are not affected by global
styles. HTML Templates allow you to create reusable templates for
rendering content within your web components. While building web
components can involve some boilerplate code, there are tools like Lit
that simplify the process, making it more streamlined and ergonomic.

 HOW CORE WEB VITALS SAVED USERS 10,000 YEARS OF WAITING FOR WEB PAGES
TO LOAD (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Chrome introduced Core Web Vitals (CWV) in 2020 to measure web
performance. Today, over 40% of sites pass all of the CWV metrics,
resulting in pages that load and respond to interactions more quickly.


 WHAT‚ÄôS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN API LATENCY AND API RESPONSE TIME? (5
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 API latency refers to the time it takes for a request to travel from
the client to the server, get processed on the server, and then return
a response back to the client. API response time encompasses the
entire time it takes for a client to send a request to an API, the
server to process that request, and for the server to send a complete
response back to the client.
