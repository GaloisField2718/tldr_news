ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 A DEEP DIVE INTO DEEPLY RECURSIVE GO (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Deep recursion in Go programming is dangerous as it can lead to stack
exhaustion and program crashes. This is because Go doesn't support
tail call optimization and has limited stack memory that grows in 2KB
increments until hitting system limits. This can be a security concern
in Go, as stack exhaustion was the root cause of three
Denial-of-Service vulnerabilities fixed in Go 1.22.7 and 1.23.1. 

 ARCHITECTING WITH CONSTRAINTS: A PRAGMATIC GUIDE (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A "constraint-based architecture" approach is when developers analyze
project requirements before choosing tools rather than defaulting to
heavy frameworks like React or Next.js for simple tasks. For example,
a mostly static product page with one interactive carousel component
can be built more efficiently using Astro with Web Components (via
Lit) to create "islands of interactivity" that only ship JavaScript
where needed. This allows devs to match tool complexity to actual
project needs.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MY EXPERIENCE WITH CLAUDE CODE AFTER 2 WEEKS OF ADVENTURES (14 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 This dev used Claude Code for two weeks for tasks such as bounty work
and consulting. Initially, they heavily used Cursor, but were drawn to
Claude Code by its power-user capabilities and the promise of
unlimited access to Sonnet 4 and Opus 4 models. Their workflow, which
involves dumping problems like a "therapist", uses Opus for planning
and Sonnet for execution, while documenting everything in files for
better context management. 

 ALL AI MODELS MIGHT BE THE SAME (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI models are converging towards a universal representation of
information. This hypothesis suggests that as models grow larger and
smarter, they learn increasingly similar features and relationships
within data due to the singular nature of reality. A practical
application of this hypothesis is the development of a "universal
embedding inverter" that can translate between different models'
representations, potentially enabling the decryption of ancient texts
or the understanding of whale speech. 

 HOW I USE CLAUDE CODE TO SHIP LIKE A TEAM OF FIVE (12 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Claude Code allows this dev to focus on high-level tasks like system
architecture and product thinking while AI handles the implementation
details and mundane coding tasks. He effectively acts as an
engineering manager, overseeing AI developers while working on
multiple features simultaneously.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BUILD AN MCP SERVER IN YOUR NEXT.JS APPLICATION (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Clerk's new MCP Server support for Next.js lets you securely
integrate AI tools into your app. Add a spec-compliant MCP endpoint in
minutes, allowing LLMs to access user data with user consent — no
separate servers needed. Ship AI features faster without compromising
security. Read Guide [10] 

 INTRODUCING CHATGPT AGENT: BRIDGING RESEARCH AND ACTION (14 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 OpenAI has released ChatGPT agent, a new capability that allows
ChatGPT to autonomously perform complex tasks by using its own virtual
computer to interact with websites, analyze information, and use
various tools. This integrated system combines the strengths of
previous features like Operator and deep research, letting ChatGPT
handle requests such as planning trips, creating presentations, and
managing schedules. 

 LE CHAT DIVES DEEP (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Mistral AI has updated Le Chat, its AI assistant, with several new
features. These include a Deep Research mode for structured research
reports, a Voxtral voice mode for conversational interaction, and
Magistral reasoning model for thoughtful, multilingual answers. Users
can now organize conversations into Projects and edit images directly
within Le Chat. 

 REACT NATIVE SCREENS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 React Native Screens is a library that provides native navigation
container components to React Native. Intended for use as a dependency
of navigation libraries like React Navigation and Expo, it supports
multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and Windows, and can be
easily integrated into React Native projects. The library also has
experimental support for react-freeze and allows disabling native
screens for specific navigators or entirely.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE AI REPLACES SERVICES MYTH (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The idea of AI replacing services and expanding the tech market by
100-200x is a myth driven by VCs' need for a new investment narrative.
Customers view AI as software, expecting predictable costs and prices
lower than human salaries, which limits the potential revenue capture.
The author's own experience with pricing AI software supports this, as
customers readily adopted fixed, low-cost pricing but balked at
pricing that reflected the value of replacing a human employee. 

 GITLAB CATCHES MONGODB GO MODULE SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK (8 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 GitLab's automated detection system identified a supply chain attack
targeting Go developers through fake MongoDB drivers that closely
mimicked legitimate packages using typosquatting techniques. The
malicious modules, published under usernames nearly identical to the
real MongoDB Go driver (changing "qiniu" to "qiniiu" and later
"qiiniu"), contained backdoor malware that established persistent
remote access to infected systems through a multi-layered payload
delivery system.

QUICK LINKS

 ANTHROPIC TIGHTENS USAGE LIMITS FOR CLAUDE CODE – WITHOUT TELLING
USERS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic has quietly tightened usage limits for Claude Code, leaving
paying users frustrated and in the dark about the changes. 

 RUNNING TYPESCRIPT NATIVELY IN NODE.JS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Node.js versions 23.6.0 and later allow running TypeScript code
directly with type stripping enabled by default. 

 GET THE INDEX OF AN ELEMENT WITHIN ITS PARENT (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 CSS' new `sibling-index()` and `sibling-count()` functions can be
used to get an element's position among its siblings and the total
number of siblings, which then can create dynamic styling effects like
progressive border thickness and opacity based on element position. 

 AI DOESN'T MAKE DEVS AS PRODUCTIVE AS THEY THINK, STUDY FINDS (3
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A recent study found that software developers using AI assistance
perceived a 24% speed increase in their work, but in reality, they
took 19% longer to complete tasks.
