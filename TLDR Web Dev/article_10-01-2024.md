 HOW DISCORD SERVES 15-MILLION USERS ON ONE SERVER (7 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Discord is powered by Elixir and the BEAM virtual machine, allowing
lightweight parallel processes for efficient messaging. To address the
scaling challenge of the Midjourney server, which exceeded Discord‚Äôs
one million user limit for a server, Discord created a team called
MaxJourney. It implemented optimizations like "passive" connections
for inactive guilds, optimized relays, and worker processes with ETS
for handling slow tasks. 

 LOAD BALANCING ALGORITHMS EXPLAINED VISUALLY (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Load balancing algorithms are necessary as applications grow in size.
The Round Robin algorithm assigns requests to servers sequentially.
Weighted Round Robin assigns requests based on server weights. The
Least Connections algorithm directs requests to the server with the
fewest current connections. Finally, the Least Response Time algorithm
sends requests to the server with the shortest response time. 

 AVOID THESE 6 COMMON REACT USESTATE HOOK MISTAKES (4 MINUTE READ) [7]


 There are six common mistakes devs make when using React‚Äôs useState
hooks: not understanding how useState works, passing functions inline
to event handlers, mutating arrays and objects directly, making
unnecessary useState calls for each field, making incorrect state
comparisons, and not setting a proper initial state. This article
demonstrates each mistake and corresponding best practice with a code
example.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 PRODUCT MANAGEMENT IS BROKEN, A CHANGE IS COMING (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The model of product and engineering managers sounds like a promising
concept - PMs decide what to make, and EMs decide how to make it - but
it doesn‚Äôt always work in practice. For one, most people cannot be
good PMs of a new product/industry immediately, leading to bad
decision-making. Secondly, engineers build things without ever talking
to the customers and can‚Äôt make important decisions as a result.
There are two ways to fix this: get PMs closer to the business domain
and have engineers be more involved in the product side. 

 HOW TO GET üí© DONE AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEER (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The post introduces the Time Sector System, a productivity method
that helped the author finish 8 tasks a day, totaling 944 tasks in 4
months, while significantly reducing stress. The system involves
planning tasks monthly, weekly, and daily, categorizing them into time
sectors, and adjusting as needed. Even if this specific system isn't
used, the principles and lessons learned from the experience can still
be valuable.

 BEWARE OF ALL GREEN DASHBOARDS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Jeff Bezos once discussed the dangers of using metrics as proxies in
an interview. He observed how over time, companies would find
themselves blindly managing to a metric without understanding the true
underlying purpose the metric was supposed to serve as a proxy for. If
all metrics on your dashboard are green, there‚Äôs probably something
you‚Äôre not measuring correctly (or at all). 

 PERFORMANCE REVIEWS MATTER (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Performance reviews help companies reward employees correctly, give
them feedback regularly, and assess the effectiveness of managers.
While performance reviews have taken a hit in terms of frequency among
many companies over the last year, there are ways to streamline the
process to reduce the time taken for them. This includes focusing only
on essential information, simplifying the review process, and
adjusting the timeline. 

 WHERE HAVE ALL THE WEBSITES GONE? (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Internet browsing habits have changed over time in favor of
algorithm-driven content on social media platforms. As a result, the
joy of discovering interesting websites on the web has been lost.
People have stopped curating and sharing websites, leading to the
feeling that the web has lost its charm.
