ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DOUBLE-KEYED CACHING: HOW BROWSER CACHE PARTITIONING CHANGED THE WEB
(6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Double-keyed caching changes how browsers store resources by
partitioning cache entries based on both the top-level site and
resource URL, preventing cross-site tracking and timing attacks. This
is better for security, but it increases cache misses, bandwidth
usage, and performance costs. 

 BUILD SYSTEMS AND BUNDLERS (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article explores the relationship between bundlers and build
systems, arguing that bundlers can be viewed as build systems with
additional task descriptions. It analyzes various build systems (Make,
Excel, Bazel, and Shake) based on their schedulers (topological,
restarting, and suspending) and rebuilders (dirty bit, verifying
traces, and constructive traces). Bundlers are then examined through
this lens, and the approaches in Webpack, Turbopack, Vite, and Rspack
are compared. This comparison revealed that many lack features already
present in established build systems. A path to having features like
minimality, early cutoff, parallelism, and remote caching/execution is
presented.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I AM (NOT) A FAILURE: LESSONS LEARNED FROM SIX (AND A HALF) FAILED
STARTUP ATTEMPTS (23 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This author goes over lessons from his six-and-a-half failed startup
attempts and a failed academic career. His initial foray into startups
was after the Google IPO, where he was an early employee. These
failures spanned various industries, from networking technology to
private jet chartering and financial software, with challenges in
execution, market dynamics, and securing funding. The author
attributes their current happiness not to financial success, but to
self-acceptance and the ability to persevere through repeated
failures. 

 I'LL THINK TWICE BEFORE USING GITHUB ACTIONS AGAIN (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 GitHub Actions has limitations when used with a large monorepo and
frequent deployments. A major issue is the difficulty of enforcing
required checks across multiple independent modules within the
monorepo, requiring cumbersome workarounds. This author criticizes the
lack of reusability and maintainability in GitHub Actions workflows,
leading to complex YAML files and potential errors. 

 WILL AI EAT THE BROWSER? (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The browser, originally designed for document-centric navigation, is
increasingly ill-suited for the emerging AI-driven, immersive web
experience. Devices like Apple's Vision Pro show the limitations of
traditional browsers, especially when integrated with AR, VR, and
generative AI. The future of the browser will likely evolve into a
more personalized, AI-centric system.
