ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 VIDEO GAME BLURS (AND HOW THE BEST ONE WORKS) (41 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 There are different ways to implement blurs in video games, from
basic box blur to the efficient Dual Kawase Blur. This article goes
over their mathematical principles and performance trade-offs. It even
shows interactive visualizations and benchmarks to help understand the
impact of different blur algorithms on visual quality and GPU
performance. 

 KEEPING SECRETS OUT OF LOGS (36 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 It can be challenging to prevent secrets from being logged. There's
no single solution - instead, one can use multiple imperfect methods
for defense-in-depth. This article covers these methods: better data
architecture, transformations, domain primitives, log formatters,
tests, scanners, and pre-processors. 

 THE WHOP CHOP: HOW WE CUT A RAILS TEST SUITE AND CI TIME IN HALF (8
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Whop's Rails test suite runtime was cut in half by using TestProf and
StackProf to identify performance bottlenecks. The biggest win came
from disabling Rails' verbose SQL logging and query log tags in the
test environment, which eliminated I/O overhead from thousands of
database queries being written to disk. Additional optimizations
included disabling Sentry logging during tests and addressing
FactoryBot overhead, reducing single process test runs from ~25
minutes to ~12 minutes and CI runs from ~4 minutes to ~2 minutes.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BEING GOOD ISN'T ENOUGH (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Being technically skilled is a good start to advancing your career,
but eventually, it will not be enough to stand out, as everyone
becomes skilled. Expanding your impact requires combining technical
skills with product thinking, project execution, and people skills.
The most important trait is agency: taking initiative to make things
happen and continually improving in the open. 

 STOP SHIPPING PNGS IN YOUR GAMES (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Using PNGs for game textures is suboptimal. There are better
alternatives like KTX2 and DDS. These formats are designed for texture
data, such as features like pregenerated mipmaps, cubemaps, and
GPU-compatible compression (like BCn) for improved storage, VRAM
usage, and performance. Tools like Zex can help export to these
formats, as most image editors lack native support. 

 SWITCHING FROM DOCKER TO PODMAN (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Podman is a better containerization tool than Docker due to its
daemonless architecture. It is better for security and reduces single
points of failure.  Podman integrates well with systemd and
Kubernetes, making deployment and management easier.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 THE 4 DRIVERS OF BETTER CX (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Everyone claims to be customer-centric. How can dev teams actually
deliver on this promise? This Datadog eBook [10] looks at 4 key
drivers: technology, analytics, security, and collaboration. Get your
copy [10] 

 CK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Ck is a semantic grep tool that makes code search better by
understanding meaning rather than just keywords. It offers drop-in
grep compatibility with added features like semantic, hybrid, and JSON
output search modes. The tool indexes code once for fast semantic
searches and automatically excludes common build and cache
directories. 

 REACT SERVER COMPONENTS SUPPORT WITHOUT A FRAMEWORK (8 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Forket is a tool that enables the use of React Server Components
(RSC) without requiring a specific framework like Next.js. It works by
splitting code into client and server versions, building a component
dependency graph, and managing the serialization and hydration of
components. To use it, run Forket during the build process to
transform the code and then integrate runtime glue code into the HTTP
server to handle component streaming and hydration. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY LANGUAGE MODELS HALLUCINATE (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This research paper from OpenAI investigates why language models like
ChatGPT hallucinate. Current training and evaluation methods
inadvertently reward guessing over admitting uncertainty, as
accuracy-focused scoreboards prioritize correct answers, even if
obtained through chance. This incentivizes models to guess instead of
abstaining when unsure, leading to confident errors on low-frequency
facts that are difficult to predict. 

 CLAUDE CODE FRAMEWORK WARS (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Providing structure to AI coding workflows improves output and shifts
developer roles towards higher-level tasks. For example, devs can use
markdown backlogs, role simulation, and custom tool libraries to
improve Claude Code's capabilities. 

 GOOGLE CHROME AT 17 - A HISTORY OF OUR BROWSER (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google Chrome launched on September 2, 2008, with a multi-process
architecture that isolated tabs into separate processes for better
stability, along with the V8 JavaScript engine that improved web app
performance. Over its 17-year history, Chrome has continuously focused
on four core principles: speed, security, stability, and simplicity.
The browser evolved from a small skunkworks project by ex-Firefox
engineers at Google into a platform used by billions. It pioneered
technologies like SPDY (which became HTTP/2) and QUIC (which became
HTTP/3).

 WHY ML NEEDS A NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (86 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This is an interview with Chris Lattner, creator of LLVM and Swift,
about his new programming language Mojo, which is designed to address
the performance and portability challenges of modern AI hardware by
combining Python-like syntax with metaprogramming and type system
features. 

 THE MATHS YOU NEED TO START UNDERSTANDING LLMS (19 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This guide goes over the necessary high-school-level math concepts
like vectors, matrices, and projections, essential for understanding
LLM inference. 

 KRUCI: POST-MORTEM OF A UI LIBRARY (23 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This dev tried to create a new terminal UI library in Rust, but
ultimately concluded that the potential gains in performance were
outweighed by the increased complexity and development challenges,
leading them to abandon the project.
