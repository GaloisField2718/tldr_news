 THE NEW DEVEX DILEMMA: TIME SAVED, COMPLEXITY GAINED (SPONSOR) [4] 

 While AI is accelerating development, it's also introducing friction
in unexpected places. In Atlassian's _2025 State of Developer
Experience_ report [4], 3,500 developers and managers weigh in on
what's working, what's not, and how AI is reshaping the future of
software teams.

The results? More time gained, but also more complexity, unclear
alignment, and a growing need for better DevEx strategy [5].

Whether you're navigating tool sprawl or rethinking team workflows,
this report is packed with insights to help you cut through the noise
and build better. Click to get the full report [4]and level up your
team's experience.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY OBSERVABILITY ISN'T JUST FOR SRES (AND HOW DEVS CAN GET STARTED)
(11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenTelemetry (OTel) is a vendor-agnostic framework that introduces
the idea of signals, primarily traces, metrics, and logs, which
describe what your application is doing. It acts as a safety net for
bugs, especially as systems scale. 

 WHAT IS THE N+1 QUERY PROBLEM AND HOW TO SOLVE IT? (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The N+1 query problem is a performance bottleneck where a program
makes one initial query and then N additional queries within a loop.
The problem happens when fetching related data, resulting in excessive
database traffic and slow application performance. The solutions
include using a single query with a JOIN or fetching related data in
batches using an IN clause, then building the relationship in code.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 6 WEEKS OF CLAUDE CODE (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Claude Code changed Puzzmo's engineering over the past six weeks,
with a huge reduction in maintenance costs and an increased capacity
for handling technical debt. It enabled rapid prototyping and sped up
triage by offering immediate pull requests. Claude Code is most
effective for developers with product and technical skills who have a
"full-breadth developer" mindset. 

 LIVE CODING SUCKS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Live coding interviews are unfair because the stress induced by being
watched reduces cognitive function, specifically working memory, which
is necessary for solving coding problems. A study by Microsoft showed
a large decrease in performance when candidates were observed during
coding. Live coding measures stress response more than actual coding
ability and may lead to the rejection of qualified engineers. 

 IF YOU'RE REMOTE, RAMBLE (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 For small remote teams, creating individual "ramblings" channels in
their chat app allows each member to share thoughts and updates
without disrupting main group channels. These channels function as
personal journals or microblogs, allowing for better social connection
and "water cooler talk" in the absence of in-person interactions. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LANGEXTRACT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 LangExtract is a Python library by Google that uses LLMs to extract
structured information from unstructured text documents based on
user-defined instructions. It has source grounding, reliable
structured outputs, and optimization for long documents with
interactive visualization. LangExtract supports various LLMs,
including cloud-based models like Gemini and OpenAI, as well as local
open-source models. 

 TRACEROOT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 TraceRoot is an open-source debugging platform that uses AI to help
engineers resolve production issues faster by combining traces, logs,
and source code. The platform has features such as real-time tracing
and logging, structured logging for improved AI agent performance, and
integration with tools like GitHub and Notion. 

 INTRODUCING CEREBRAS CODE (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cerebras is launching Cerebras Code, two new plans (Pro at $50/month
and Max at $200/month) that offer access to the Qwen3-Coder, a recent
open-weight coding model. These plans provide speeds up to 2,000
tokens per second with a large context window and no vendor lock-in.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A.I. RESEARCHERS ARE NEGOTIATING $250 MILLION PAY PACKAGES. JUST LIKE
NBA STARS (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI researchers are being recruited like NBA stars and offered huge
compensation packages. Tech companies like Meta are offering
nine-figure salaries and perks to lure top AI talent, even engaging in
personal recruitment efforts by CEOs. One 24-year-old researcher
landed a $250M pay package to quit the startup he co-founded and join
Meta's Superintelligence Lab. 

 PERSONA VECTORS: MONITORING AND CONTROLLING CHARACTER TRAITS IN
LANGUAGE MODELS (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic has identified "persona vectors" within AI models' neural
networks that control character traits, allowing for control of
personality. These vectors were discovered through the analysis of
activity patterns associated with specific traits like "evil" or
"sycophancy." They can be used to monitor personality shifts, mitigate
undesirable traits during training (even acting as a "vaccine" by
preemptively steering towards those traits), and flag problematic
training data. 

 DOES THE BITTER LESSON HAVE LIMITS? (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The "bitter lesson" in AI argues that general methods that use
computation outperform human-centric approaches in the long run.
However, the bitter lesson depends on high-quality, quantifiable data,
which is often difficult to obtain in messy organizational
environments. Also, prioritizing computation over efficient,
purpose-built models might not always be practical or optimal in the
real world.

QUICK LINKS

 I COULDN'T SUBMIT A PR, SO I GOT HIRED AND FIXED IT MYSELF (3 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Frustrated by a long-standing search bug on Mintlify that he couldn't
fix as a vendor, this dev joined the company and finally resolved the
issue using an AbortController. 

 HTML IN CANVAS (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 The "HTML-in-Canvas" proposal introduces new HTML Canvas APIs for
rendering HTML content into a canvas, addressing limitations in
accessibility, internationalization, and performance when using
canvas-based content. 

 TRY DEEP THINK IN THE GEMINI APP (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Google is releasing "Deep Think," a more powerful version of Gemini
2.5 Pro, for Google AI Ultra subscribers and providing the gold-medal
standard version to select mathematicians. 

 ANTHROPIC REVOKES OPENAI'S ACCESS TO CLAUDE (7 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Anthropic revoked OpenAI's access to its Claude API due to OpenAI's
alleged violation of terms of service by using Claude and Claude Code
internally during development.
