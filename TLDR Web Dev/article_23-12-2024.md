ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT EVERY DEVELOPER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT OFFLINE-FIRST APPS (12 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Offline-first app development prioritizes local data storage and
synchronization with the server after the fact, so that data persists
even without internet connectivity. This article goes into the various
ways to implement offline-first architectures natively on the web
using components like IndexedDB, the Cache API, and Service Workers.
It also goes over strategies for conflict resolution, state
management, error recovery, and testing. 

 HOW BLOOM FILTERS MADE SQLITE 10X FASTER (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers significantly improved SQLite's analytical query
performance by using Bloom filters. The original nested loop join
implementation in SQLite, used for joining tables, resulted in many
costly B-tree probes. By incorporating Bloom filters, the researchers
created a pre-filtering mechanism, drastically reducing the number of
B-tree probes needed. This optimization, implemented via new "Filter"
and "FilterAdd" opcodes, resulted in a 7x-10x speed increase for
analytical queries in SQLite. 

 WHY WE USE OUR OWN HARDWARE AT FASTMAIL (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Fastmail uses its own hardware for email services because it allows
for cost optimization and long-term planning over the dynamic scaling
offered by cloud services. This approach allows for more efficient
hardware usage, where equipment can be used for 5-10 years. Fastmail
recently upgraded to a ZFS-based NVMe SSD system, leading to big
performance and space savings through compression while eliminating
the complexities of traditional RAID setups.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ON LONG TERM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Long-term software development is best done by minimizing
dependencies, rigorously testing, and prioritizing simple,
well-documented code to combat complexity that inevitably increases
over time. The importance of a stable team, regular dependency audits,
and comprehensive logging were also stressed in the author's
presentation shown in this article. 

 KEEPING A CHANGELOG AT WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The author advocates for maintaining a personal changelog of work
activities, inspired by open-source best practices. This changelog
improves communication in one-on-one meetings, onboarding new
employees, and provides a personal reference and self-reflection tool.
The author's changelog, updated weekly, enhances transparency and
trust with colleagues and managers by providing a clear record of
their work. The benefits include increased productivity, improved
knowledge sharing, and self-assessment of work efficiency, ultimately
leading to professional growth. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING S2 (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 S2 is a new serverless stream storage service designed to be a
cloud-native alternative to traditional streaming platforms like
Kafka. It offers a simple, scalable API for appending and reading
records with strong consistency and concurrency control. It has more
throughput and lower latency than existing serverless options. 

 STAGEHAND (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Stagehand is an open-source, AI-powered web automation framework
built on Playwright that offers simple APIs (act, extract, and
observe) for natural language-driven web interactions. It supports
various LLMs. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW TO MAKE LLMS SHUT UP (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 To address the problem of an AI code review bot generating excessive
comments, the Greptile team experimented with various methods,
including prompt engineering and using the LLM to judge its own
comments, but these attempts failed. They eventually succeeded by
implementing a clustering approach, using vector embeddings of past
comments to identify and filter out "nit" comments (those technically
correct but unimportant). This resulted in a big increase in the
percentage of Greptile's comments addressed by developers from 19% to
over 55%. 

 TRANSLATING JAVA TO KOTLIN AT SCALE (16 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Meta undertook a massive project to translate its Android codebase
from Java to Kotlin, exceeding the halfway point despite having one of
the world's largest codebases. To manage this at scale, it created the
Kotlinator, a tool that automates the conversion process using
JetBrains' J2K, supplemented by extensive pre- and post-processing
steps to handle complexities and custom frameworks. This automation
involved addressing build speed issues and creating a headless version
of J2K to run conversions remotely, integrated with Meta's internal
code review system.

QUICK LINKS

 FINDMY.PY (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 FindMy.py is a cross-platform Python library for interacting with
Apple's Find My network. 

 BEING A DEVELOPER IN THE AGE OF REASONING AI (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI's o3 model synthesizes code like a developer, blurring the
lines between user and developer roles and prompting questions about
developer relevance and the ethical implications of trusting
AI-generated code without understanding its logic. 

 GITHUB ASSISTANT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 GitHub Assistant is a proof-of-concept application that allows devs
to ask questions to GitHub repositories using natural language. 

 ASK HN: HOW DOES JETBRAINS PROTECT THEIR IDE JAVA SOURCE CODE?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [16] 

 The JetBrains IDE source code is easily accessible and people will
pay for it still due to other benefits, such as release cadence of new
features.
