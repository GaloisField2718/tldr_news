ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 JAVASCRIPT VISUALIZED - PROMISE EXECUTION (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This blog post shows how to use promises in JavaScript to enable
non-blocking async tasks. It breaks down the process from start to
finish. Promises can trigger an asynchronous action if a handler is
attached by either then or catch. Since the handlers are pushed to the
Microtask Queue, you can handle the eventual result in a non-blocking
way. This makes it easier to handle errors, chain multiple operations
together, and keep your code more readable. 

 WHY CHOOSE ASYNC/AWAIT OVER THREADS? (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The debate between using threads and async/await in Rust revolves
around simplicity, performance, and composability. While threads may
offer familiarity and straightforwardness, async/await is better in
I/O-bound scenarios due to its composable code.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FEAR MAKES YOU A WORSE PROGRAMMER (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Fear leads to overly cautious behavior and can hinder important code
or system changes. Tools and team processes like version control,
testing, and blameless postmortems can help mitigate fear. Programmers
should feel comfortable making changes without the fear of breaking
things or facing punishment. While some fears may be irrational,
overcoming them through positive experiences can build confidence and
improve software development. 

 SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING IS A WASTE OF AN INFORMATION CHANNEL (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Syntax highlighting today uses color to distinguish code elements,
but this doesn‚Äôt fully utilize the power of color to convey
information. We could use dynamic color highlighting overlays to
communicate things like scope, imports, argument flow, types, or even
metadata about test failures. 

 A16Z BLOGS ARE JUST GLORIFIED MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 a16z blog posts are subtle marketing for its portfolio companies
rather than offering impartial overviews of technology landscapes.
This author notes how an a16z post on LLM architectures omitted
competing open-source vector database solutions in favor of one it
funded. This pattern extends to other a16z publications and even its
voting practices with crypto companies.

 AI HALLUCINATES SOFTWARE PACKAGES AND DEVS DOWNLOAD THEM ‚Äì EVEN IF
POTENTIALLY POISONED WITH MALWARE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Researchers found that AI bots often invent fake software packages

installing it.
