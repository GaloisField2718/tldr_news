 FROM WEB TO NATIVE WITH REACT (23 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 React Native is a framework that lets developers build native mobile
apps using JavaScript and React. It has some key differences from
React, such as the use of native UI primitives and the lack of global
styling. This transition guide for React devs interested in building
mobile apps provides a deep dive into the differences between React
and React Native and discusses common mistakes new devs make, such as
using array.map for large lists, using the default Button element, and
placing secrets in app code. 

 REACT ARCHITECTURE DOMAIN LOGIC (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Domain logic refers to code that operates on the core models of an
application. Extracting domain logic from components and placing it in
a dedicated domain layer improves code readability, testability, and
reusability. It also reduces the need for complex testing setups and
allows for focused unit tests. 

 ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES FOR BUILDING FINANCIAL SYSTEMS (11 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Accounting systems should be accurate, auditable, and timely. Data
should be immutable, durable, and recorded at the smallest grain and
code should be idempotent. This article also goes through best
practices for building financial systems, such as using integers for
financial amounts, consistent rounding methods, delayed currency
conversion, and integer representations of time.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 UBUNTU SECURITY UPDATES ARE A CONFUSING MESS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A patch for a vulnerability in Apache Tomcat 9 on Ubuntu 22.04 is
only available to Ubuntu Pro subscribers. This is because Tomcat 9 is
part of the universe repository, which is only supported on a "Best
Effort" basis for regular users. Canonical has decided to withhold the
patch from regular users despite having it available for Ubuntu Pro
subscribers.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ICONOGRAPHY OF THE X WINDOW SYSTEM: THE BOOT STIPPLE (18 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 The X Window System's boot stipple, a mesh pattern displayed during
startup, served as an early indicator of successful configuration and
helped users troubleshoot issues in the era of slow computers. Its
disappearance in the mid-2010s was likely due to efforts to modernize
and speed up Linux boot processes. While the stipple can be brought
back through command-line flags, the process is fragmented across
different display managers, reflecting the complex and sometimes
unpolished nature of the X ecosystem.
