 ELIMINATING JAVASCRIPT COLD STARTS ON AWS LAMBDA (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Porffor is a new JavaScript engine that compiles JS code
ahead-of-time to WebAssembly and native binaries, creating much
smaller and faster executables compared to Node.js and other runtimes.
In AWS Lambda cold start benchmarks, Porffor performed ~12x faster
than Node.js and ~4x faster than Amazon's LLRT while being over 2x
cheaper to run than Node.js. However, Porffor is still in pre-alpha
development with limited JavaScript support and no current Node.js API
compatibility, making it unsuitable for production use yet. 

 FROM PYTHON TO GO: WHY WE REWROTE OUR INGEST PIPELINE AT TELEMETRY
HARBOR (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 At Telemetry Harbor, the team initially chose Python FastAPI for
their time-series data ingestion pipeline to prioritize rapid
prototyping and market validation, but as their user base grew, they
encountered severe performance bottlenecks with CPU usage spiking to
800% and system crashes under moderate loads. After careful evaluation
between Rust and Go, they decided to rewrite their core ingest system
in Go due to its balance of performance, simplicity, and easier
learning curve compared to Rust's steep complexity. 

 FLASHLIST V2: A GROUND-UP REWRITE FOR REACT NATIVE'S NEW ARCHITECTURE
(8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Shopify first released FlashList in 2022 and has now introduced
FlashList v2, a complete rewrite of React Native's list component that
eliminates the need for devs to provide item size estimates and
achieves better load and scroll perf by using React Native's New
Architecture for synchronous layout measurements. FlashList v2 is now
production-ready and powers thousands of lists in Shopify's mobile
app, with 2M+ monthly downloads.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BEST PRACTICES FOR BUILDING AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS: WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS
IN PRODUCTION (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article outlines best practices for building agentic AI systems
based on real production experience. The optimal architecture features
a two-tier system with Primary Agents that maintain context and
orchestrate tasks, plus stateless Subagents that work like pure
functions without memory or state. Critical principles include keeping
subagents stateless for parallel execution, using structured
communication protocols, and employing orchestration patterns like
MapReduce and Sequential Pipeline, depending on task dependencies. 

 HOW TO SCALE CODE REVIEWS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Key practices to scaling code reviews include keeping changes small,
responding to reviews within 24 hours, and using automated checks like
unit tests and static analysis to let reviewers focus on high-level
feedback. This article advocates for a structured 5-step workflow from
PR creation through deployment, complemented by AI tools to reduce
review time and improve developer velocity.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MINECRAFT MCP SERVER (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Microsoft has released a Minecraft MCP server that enables Claude and
other supported LLMs to control a Minecraft character. 

 CRONICLE (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Cronicle is a multi-server task scheduler and runner with a web-based
front-end UI that handles both scheduled, repeating, and on-demand
jobs across multiple slave servers. It provides real-time statistics
and a live log viewer for monitoring job execution.

 THE FUTURE OF JAVASCRIPT: WHAT AWAITS US (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 JavaScript continues to evolve rapidly. The TC39 committee has
advanced nine proposals, including the newly standardized explicit
resource management feature using the using keyword for automatic
cleanup, and Array.fromAsync for handling async iterables. Other
notable developments include candidate features like immutable
ArrayBuffers, draft proposals for deterministic random number
generation and number clamping methods, and early-stage proposals for
improved internationalization formatting and comparison utilities. 

 REACT INTERNALS: WHICH USEEFFECT HOOK RUNS FIRST (4 MINUTE READ) [13]


 If you've ever stacked up multiple useEffect hooks and found yourself
wondering which one fires first, this article breaks it down with
clarity. A child's useEffect runs before its parent's, thanks to
React's depth-first traversal during the commit phase. This is a great
explanation with drawings to show you what's really happening under
the hood in an useEffect hook and how React traverses the DOM tree at
the Render and commit phases.

 An AI generated book about React that teaches React and humorously
complains about its complexity and design decisions. 

 FIXING A 10 YEAR OLD MISTAKE IN RAILS (PULL REQUEST) [15] 

 This PR found and removed a 10 year old mistake in Rails, proving
that there's always low-hanging performance-gaining fruit to be found.
