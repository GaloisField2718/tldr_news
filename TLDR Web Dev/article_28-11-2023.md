 KEEP ALL YOUR API WORK IN ONE PLACE‚ÄîREQUESTS, DOCUMENTATION, TESTS,
AND MORE (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Managing APIs and requests gets messy fast.
We all know the feeling: you trawl through documentation and code to
figure out how to write a request. A month later, you need to update
some parameters and end up repeating most of your work. Not ideal!

Postman Collections [5] keep you organized and effective. With
collections, you can link related API elements together for easy
editing, sharing, testing, and reuse. Improve developer productivity
with all of the API elements you need, bundled together in one place.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WEB COMPONENTS ELIMINATE JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORK LOCK-IN (12 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 HTML Web Components are versatile because they can be decoupled from
JavaScript frameworks, allowing for multiple frameworks to be used at
the same time. This article demonstrates this approach through the
creation of a simple todo app where each component is written in a
different framework including React, Solid, Svelte, and Vue, as well
as a component in vanilla JavaScript. From a usage point of view, web
components are just HTML tags, even though they are more complex under
the hood. 

 FRONT-END SECURITY BEST PRACTICES (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Front-end security plays a critical role in safeguarding web
applications against threats like cross-site scripting (XSS),
cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and other vulnerabilities. Key
practices for front-end security include input validation and
sanitization to filter and clean user input, avoiding inline scripts
and implementing Content Security Policies (CSPs) to restrict
unauthorized code execution, using HTTPS for secure data transfer,
conducting penetration testing to identify and address
vulnerabilities, and efficient dependency management to keep libraries
updated. 

 CONVERTING STATEFUL APPLICATION TO STATELESS USING AWS SERVICES (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article by AWS outlines a five-step process for transitioning
from a stateful to a stateless architecture, which includes
identifying stateful components, decoupling user profile data,
offloading session data, scaling components dynamically, and designing
a stateless architecture. Data from one session carries over to the
next in stateful systems, while stateless systems do not preserve data
between sessions and rely on external entities for state management.
The article elaborates on the benefits of stateless architecture, such
as scalability and extensibility, while acknowledging that the right
architecture depends on the specific needs of the application.

 6 TINY WORDING TWEAKS TO LEVEL UP COMMUNICATION AS A SOFTWARE
ENGINEER (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Communicating in the workplace effectively is essential for a growing
developer career. This article suggests six small changes you can make
in the way you phrase questions and requests, with evidence and
anecdotes provided for each one. These small tweaks can help
facilitate smooth communication with your team and collaborators on
the job. 

 JUST SHIP, BABY (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 While practices like test-driven development (TDD) provide stability
and help in maintaining quality, they can become a trap if they hinder
the delivery of the software. Kent Beck, the creator of TDD, reflects
on their own experience with JUnit, emphasizing the need to sometimes
prioritize progress over perfection. They advocate for a pragmatic
approach, acknowledging that while it's essential to follow good
practices, they shouldn't become an excuse for not shipping.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HTML DOM (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This repository introduces browser DOM APIs and teaches how to use

real use cases. 

 CHARDET (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Chardet is a character detection module developed entirely in
TypeScript designed to identify encoding based on occurrence analysis.

Browser, Native) and platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows), without any
dependencies or native code/bindings. 

 ACTIONS/GITHUB-SCRIPT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This GitHub Action makes it easy to quickly write a script in a
GitHub workflow that uses the GitHub API and the workflow‚Äôs context.
To use this action, a developer needs to provide an input named
`script` that contains the body of an asynchronous function call.

 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND POST MORTEMS (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Effective crisis management and learning from failures in tech
leadership roles are essential for successful software companies.
Blameless post-mortems are crucial learning tools for improving future
practices. Mistakes are inevitable, but the response to these
mistakes, including clear communication, owning up to errors, and
implementing corrective measures, defines effective leadership. 

 WHAT IS OPENAI, REALLY? (26 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI, which initially opted for a non-profit model when it was
founded in 2015, later adopted a for-profit model. The company
recently experienced a major crisis, with its CEO Sam Altman being
fired, leading to employee revolt and threats of mass resignation. The
crisis was resolved with Altman's return and board restructuring. This
article not only summarizes the recent OpenAI saga, but also touches
on OpenAI's fast-paced success with ChatGPT, the contrasting
directions it has pulled the company in, and Microsoft's interest in
maintaining an independent OpenAI team. 

 RESHAPING THE TREE: REBUILDING ORGANIZATIONS FOR AI (9 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Organizational structures have evolved constantly in response to
technological advancements, beginning with the New York and Erie
Railroad in 1855 and its innovative use of the telegraph and
organizational charts. This article draws parallels between historical
shifts in organizational practices due to technological changes, like
Henry Ford's assembly lines, and the current potential impact of AI on
organizational processes. Using the example of Wharton Interactive, a
software startup, the article illustrates how AI, specifically large
language models like GPT-4, can be integrated into various
organizational roles.
