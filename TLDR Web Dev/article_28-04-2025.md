 TRADITIONAL OBSERVABILITY IS A DEAD END. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE WITH
SENTRY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 3 AM. Production is down. You dive into logs, metrics, traces. Your
dashboard shows you _something_ is wrong..._somewhere_. Four energy
drinks later, you've learned nothing.

Sentry [4] cuts through the noise. It shows you exactly which query is
causing that database meltdown or which API call is breaking your
frontend. Now you have a clear understanding of your code [4] — and
how to actually fix it.

✅ Class Technologies shortened time-to-resolution by 40% and cut
observability costs by 80% with Sentry. So can you.

Want to see how? Hop on a bi-weekly group demo [5] to learn about
Sentry in a casual, no-slides-attached environment.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SMARTER SEARCH AT AIRBNB: HOW EMBEDDING-BASED RETRIEVAL WORKS (11
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Airbnb improved its search system using Embedding-Based Retrieval,
which represents both listings and search queries as vectors in a
shared space to find relevant matches. The system used a two-tower
model architecture, where one tower processes listing information and
the other processes search query information to create embeddings that
were compared to quickly narrow down results. Airbnb trained this
model using contrastive learning, pushing similar queries and listings
closer together while distancing dissimilar ones. 

 BEST PRACTICES FOR REDUCING LAG IN EXPO APPS (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 One of the best ways to reduce lag in Expo apps is by focusing on
JavaScript performance and thread management. Modern JavaScript
features like TypeScript and ESM syntax, with tools like ESLint for
React rule enforcement, help make code more efficient. React Compiler
also adds for automatic memoization and optimization. For advanced
optimization, using React 19's `use` API and multi-threading with
Reanimated worklets for complex animations are good options to
explore.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BUSINESS FOUNDERS ARE LESS VALUABLE THAN THEY THINK (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Non-technical business founders often overestimate their value in
tech startups and struggle to find technical co-founders because they
lack the skills to execute their ideas. While ideas are important,
execution, primarily driven by technical expertise in the early
stages, holds greater value. Business founders can become valuable by
focusing on their strengths: customer acquisition, relationship
building, and their ability to create a significant customer base or
get strategic partnerships. 

 THAT'S HOW WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THINGS AROUND HERE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Software teams often follow outdated and unnecessary practices
without questioning their purpose. These practices in software
engineering, such as limiting line width or adhering to outdated team
rules, can slow down teams for no good reason. Instead, devs should
ask clarifying questions, suggest alternatives, and test the relevance
of existing processes. 

 STARTUP WEEKEND: HOW WE WON THE COMPETITION (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A team won an Italian startup weekend competition. In this post, they
talk about what they learned, such as the importance of validating a
real-world problem by talking to potential users. Their solution to
the problem was also reasoned well, with their pitch deck being clear,
clean, and concise.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 EBOOK: DE-RISKING AI-DRIVEN RELEASES WITH METRICS-DRIVEN GUARDED
RELEASES (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Traditional APM tools often miss targeted issues during complex
feature deployments. LaunchDarkly's Guarded Releases capability ties
specific metrics to feature flags, enabling enhanced observability of
a single feature and dramatically reducing MTTR. Learn how to get
started [11] with common engineering metrics, and progress to critical
business metrics, in this free ebook [11]. 

 TILT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Tilt is a tool that automates microservice development on Kubernetes,
making the process of building, deploying, and updating applications
easier. 

 MAGNITUDE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Magnitude is an open-source, AI-native testing framework for web apps
that utilizes visual AI agents to adapt to UI changes. It allows devs

 LOGCHEF (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Logchef is a high-performance log analytics platform for efficient
log management and analysis. It uses ClickHouse for fast log storage
and querying, with schema-agnostic exploration and flexible query
options, including both simple search syntax and full ClickHouse SQL.
It also has team-based access control and is deployed as a single
binary.
