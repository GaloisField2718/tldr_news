 FRONTEND PREDICTIONS FOR 2024 (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In 2023, there were significant advancements in server-side
rendering, increased interest in AI integration, browser and
JavaScript engine improvements (like Bun), and improvements to
cross-platform frameworks like React Native and Flutter. In 2024,
there will be a focus on consolidating tools and frameworks, increased
competition to own the entire software stack, more diversity in web
engines with Apple's changes that will open up the web on mobile,
continued AI advancements, and the dominance of existing UI frameworks
like React. Native mobile development is expected to remain relatively
unchanged. 

 THE WEBSITE VS. WEB APP DICHOTOMY DOESN'T EXIST (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The website vs. web app dichotomy posits that websites can be grouped
into two categories: mostly static ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù with little user
interaction beyond following links (websites) and ‚Äúapplications‚Äù
that involve rich dynamic behavior, needing JavaScript frameworks (web
apps). There‚Äôs a spectrum between websites and web apps, and where a
project sits determines which technologies are appropriate for
building it. This post argues that such a spectrum is not conclusive
and should be broken down more with axes spanning static/dynamic and
online/offline.

responsibilities. 

 IS HTMX JUST ANOTHER JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORK? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 HTMX can function as both a library and a framework, depending on its
usage. HTMX primarily relies on HTML, making it more adaptable and
compatible with various development tools, reducing the risk of code
obsolescence.

 HOW GOOGLE PERFECTED THE WEB (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google controls 90% of the search market, so businesses and content
creators are heavily focused on search engine optimization to enhance
their visibility on Google. This optimization has led to an abundance
of content designed specifically to capture Google's attention,
resulting in repetitive and sometimes low-quality material competing
for limited search real estate. 

 HOW BIGTECH INVESTED IN AI COMPANIES IN 2023 (8 MINUTE READ) [13]

that struck blockbuster deals. Their deals accounted for two-thirds of
the $27 billion raised by AI companies. Nvidia emerged as a prominent
investor, participating in 35 deals and establishing a venture capital
arm called NVentures. Foundation models and development platforms in
the AI sector experienced substantial growth, with major tech
companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Salesforce
investing in these areas.
