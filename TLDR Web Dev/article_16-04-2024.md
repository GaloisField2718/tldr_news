ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CSS IN REACT SERVER COMPONENTS (24 MINUTE READ) [3] 

 React Server Components (RSCs) allow server-exclusive code, which can
lead to better performance. However, this means that popular styling
options, like CSS-in-JS libraries which rely on React's lifecycle, can
conflict with RSCs. RSC's server-side focus clashes with the
browser-centric nature of traditional CSS-in-JS libraries, but there
are ‚Äúzero-runtime‚Äù CSS-in-JS libraries that are fully compatible
with RSCs today. If your application doesn't use these and already has
a good ‚Äútime-to-interactive‚Äù time, then migrating to these
libraries is not worth it. 

 HOW TO WRITE A CODE FORMATTER (27 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This article is a detailed walkthrough in building a basic code
formatter, with code examples along the way. To create a code
formatter, first transform the code into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
and then build a formatting tree using nodes that represent concepts
like text, whitespace, and indentation. Traverse the formatting tree,
rendering each node into the final formatted code. 

 DB INDEXES DO NOT MAGICALLY COMPOSE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Database indexes are similar to organized lists that help you find
information quickly. To be most effective, indexes should align
closely with how you typically query your data. Indexes don't
magically work well at random and take careful thought to get correct.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW SHOULD I EXPRESS TO MY MANAGER THAT I NEED TO "COAST" FOR A YEAR
OR TWO? (REDDIT THREAD) [6] 

 An engineer is dealing with serious family matters that requires them
to put in less effort at work. While they want to tell their manager,
commenters tell the original poster not to. Instead, they should
continue working, albeit slower, and not tell the manager anything as
nobody will probably notice. 

 HOW TO SUCCEED AS A DATA ENGINEER WITHOUT THE BURNOUT (13 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Data engineers can avoid burnout and build effective data platforms
by aligning the infrastructure with business needs, automating tasks,
and prioritizing reliability. They should monitor infrastructure
proactively and plan for failures ahead of time. 

 NAVIGATING CODE REVIEWS AS A CODE AUTHOR (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A code author should have a growth mindset and approach code reviews
as an opportunity to learn. A fixed-mindset code author views feedback
during code reviews in a defensive way.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 STOP CODING FORMS WITH A FULLY-INTEGRATED DRAG-AND-DROP FORM BUILDER
(SPONSORED) [9] 

 Tired of coding forms? With SurveyJS UI components [9], you can
generate and style dynamic JSON-based forms of any complexity right in
your JavaScript application with no need for manual coding.
The libraries utilize JSON objects for both form metadata and results,
and support seamless integration with any backend system. You can
render your custom forms and collect responses, while retaining full
control over your data.

The JSON form builder component offers a user-friendly drag-and-drop
interface, GUI for form branching, and an integrated CSS theme editor
for customizing form design.

Check out its free full-featured demo [10] to explore its capabilities
firsthand.

 SEMANTIC AUTOCOMPLETE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Semantic Autocomplete is a performant React component that extends
Material UI's autocomplete component with a local, quantized ML model.
The model is used to perform similarity search and helps match by
meaning, not just letters. The component is full-featured and doesn't
require any extending. 

 MORPHIC (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 An AI-powered answer engine with a generative UI. 

 MARKDOWNDOWN (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Convert any webpage to Markdown with images included.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WEIRD MONITOR BUGS PEOPLE SENT ME IN THE LAST 5 YEARS (8 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 This author, who develops an app that controls monitor settings, has
observed unusual monitor bugs over the years. These bugs include
monitors randomly swapping positions after standby, turning monochrome
unexpectedly, blacking out after receiving specific commands, and
ignoring input switching or mute commands. Monitors often have faulty
firmware and weird workarounds to these problems. 

 HOW DO MACHINES ‚ÄòGROK' DATA? (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Researchers have discovered that overtrained neural networks can
develop unexpected and innovative solutions to problems, a phenomenon
they have termed ‚Äúgrokking". These grokked networks solve problems
like modular arithmetic using mathematical manipulations that mimic
trigonometric functions. 

 THE ONE BILLION ROW CHALLENGE IN CUDA: FROM 17M TO 17S (10 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 This author attempted to solve the One Billion Row Challenge using
CUDA to much success. While a pure C++ solution took 16.5 minutes, the
CUDA solution achieved a 60X speedup, completing in 16.8 seconds.
