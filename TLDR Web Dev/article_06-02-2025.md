ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 STATEMENTS ABOUT STATELESS (15 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The core principles of stateless architecture are independent
requests, external state management, idempotency, decoupled
components, and horizontal scalability. The advantages of it are
better resilience and scalability, while the disadvantages include
increased network overhead and having to deal with more complex state
management. 

 DURABLE OBJECTS CALLBACKS ARE WEIRD (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Durable Objects Callbacks are a novel "static callback" pattern for
Durable Objects in Cloudflare Workers. They solve the problem of
long-running asynchronous operations needing human interaction by
decoupling callbacks from their initiating functions. This allows
Durable Objects to sleep and be awakened by events like alarms,
webhooks, or emails. 

 AVOIDING `ANY`S WITH LINTING AND TYPESCRIPT (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Using `any` in TypeScript removes type safety and can lead to hidden
errors, but people often use it anyway. It's a good practice to enable
ESLint rules to avoid `any` from sneaking into a TypeScript codebase
and use the unknown type as a safer alternative to it.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 7 PROVEN MENTAL MODELS FOR ENGINEERING MANAGERS (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There are seven mental models - Inversion, Inertia, Second-Order
Thinking, Entropy, Hanlon's Razor, Bottlenecks, and Activation Energy
- that can help engineering managers make better decisions and avoid
costly mistakes. This post explains each model along with real-world
examples. For example, inversion means to invert a problem to look at
it from the opposite perspective, such as thinking about what you
don't want in an engineer when hiring. 

 ZIG; WHAT I THINK AFTER MONTHS OF USING IT (31 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 After using Zig for a few months, this developer likes Zig's
arbitrary-sized integers, type-level functions, and C
interoperability. However, the downsides of using it include a lack of
good memory safety guarantees and a lack of features like traits and
destructors. While Zig improves upon C, it still has a ways to go to
be production-ready. 

 INGESTING MILLIONS OF PDFS AND WHY GEMINI 2.0 CHANGES EVERYTHING (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It's quite challenging to convert PDFs into machine-readable text for
RAG systems, but Google's Gemini Flash 2.0 is a cost-effective option.
It achieves near-perfect accuracy in PDF-to-markdown conversion,
outperforming other models in terms of pages processed per dollar.
However, it struggles with accurately generating bounding boxes for
text within the original PDF.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SURVIVING A PIVOT (SPONSOR) [10] 

 One year ago, the Jolt team was building an API load testing tool -
but it wasn't getting traction. Then, they built Jolt, a popular AI
coding assistant for 100K+ line codebases. Read the story [10] of how
the Jolt team realized things weren't working, and how they
successfully pivoted by aggressively investing in problem discovery.
Read more on the Jolt blog [10] 

 GEMINI 2.0 IS NOW AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google DeepMind has announced the general availability of Gemini 2.0
Flash. It also released an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Pro, its
best model yet for coding and complex prompts, and a cost-efficient
model, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite. 

 EMOJI PICKER (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Emoji Picker is a composable React emoji picker component styled with
Tailwind CSS. It offers features like virtualized lists for smooth
scrolling, keyboard navigation, and customizable styling. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 I SPENT FIVE YEARS BUILDING A WEB APP, POSTED IT ON HACKER NEWS, AND
GOT MY FIRST $1 (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This developer spent five years developing a minimalist music
composition web app. After many redesigns and optimizations, he
finally launched it on Hacker News, which gained some traction and
earned him his first dollar. 

 THE END OF SEARCH, THE BEGINNING OF RESEARCH (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 As AI learns to reason more and AI agents become more prevalent,
these systems can now conduct in-depth research and solve deeper
problems. For example, Google and OpenAI both have a Deep Research
feature, which asynchronously grabs multiple sources, parses them,
analyzes them, and outputs a report based on what the user requested.

QUICK LINKS

 PERSONAL SOFTWARE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI is making it easier for people to create custom personalized
software tailored to their specific needs rather than being forced to
use one-size-fits-all apps from others. 

 REACT QUERY - THE BAD PARTS (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A slide deck on the tradeoffs made when choosing React Query, such as
it having a large bundle size. 

 FEATURE: DOM STATE-PRESERVING MOVE (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A new DOM `moveBefore` primitive added to the latest version of
Chrome (133) allows elements to be moved within a DOM tree without
losing their state, preserving features like iframe content, focus,
and active CSS transitions.
