 FLASHLIST V2: A GROUND-UP REWRITE FOR REACT NATIVE'S NEW ARCHITECTURE
(8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 FlashList v2 is a complete rewrite of the popular React Native list
component that removes the need for item size estimates and has faster
load times with improved scrolling performance. The new version uses
React Native's New Architecture to synchronously measure layouts and
make corrections before rendering, removing the dependency on native
code that caused issues in v1. Some of the improvements include
pixel-perfect scrolling precision, better horizontal list support,
adaptive rendering algorithms, and better masonry layouts. 

 UNLOCKING WEB WORKERS WITH REACT: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 This article is a step-by-step guide on how to implement Web Workers
in React apps to prevent UI freezing during heavy computational tasks.
It teaches this through the progression from a basic problem
(calculating Fibonacci numbers blocking the main thread) to more
complex solutions. It goes over using Web Workers for background
processing, implementing task queues for ordered execution, and using
Shared Workers to share state across browser tabs. 

 GO'S RACE DETECTOR HAS A MUTEX BLIND SPOT (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Go's race detector has a blind spot when detecting data races
involving mutex-protected code. While the detector can identify races
that don't involve synchronization primitives regardless of timing, it
may miss races in mutex-protected sections depending on the execution
order. Despite this limitation, Go's race detector is one of the best
tools available for dynamic race detection to keep code relatively
race-free.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WE REPLACED PASSWORDS WITH SOMETHING WORSE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The increasingly common login method of using a 6-digit code sent to
an email or phone number isn't a good thing. It's bad for account
security because it makes users vulnerable to attacks where they
unknowingly enter codes prompted by attackers. Password managers
cannot protect against this type of phishing, leaving users exposed. 

 A NEW WORST CODER HAS ENTERED THE CHAT: VIBE CODING WITHOUT CODE
KNOWLEDGE (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While vibe coding makes creating a simple app easy, the resulting
code is often messy, insecure, and requires a lot of troubleshooting
from AI and real devs. On the other hand, devs can use AI to their
advantage to speed up their learning.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GPT-5 (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI's GPT-5 is its smartest and fastest model yet. It is now
available to everyone in ChatGPT. GPT-5 has better intelligence for
math, science, finance, law, and more, with more useful and accurate
responses and deeper thinking capabilities. It also comes with more
customization options, voice improvements, study mode, and connector
integration with Gmail and Google Calendar. 

 CURSOR CLI BETA BUILT TO HELP YOU SHIP, RIGHT FROM YOUR TERMINAL (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Cursor CLI is a tool designed to help users plan, search, and build
code directly from their terminal, integrating with various IDEs and
terminals. It provides full control, allowing users to review agent
edits, steer in real-time, and set custom rules. 

 MEET YOUR NEW AI CODING TEAMMATE: GEMINI CLI GITHUB ACTIONS (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Gemini CLI GitHub Actions is a free AI coding teammate now available
in beta. Designed for the automation of routine coding tasks within
GitHub repositories, it is triggered by events like new issues or pull
requests. It offers three initial open-source workflows: intelligent
issue triage, accelerated pull request reviews, and on-demand
collaboration through the "@gemini-cli" tag.

 BUILDING BLUESKY COMMENTS FOR MY BLOG (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Existing blog comment systems like Disqus and self-hosted solutions
annoyed this dev due to performance issues, maintenance overhead, and
lack of ownership. They decided to use Bluesky as a comment system,
using its decentralized nature, rich content support, real identities,
and cross-platform conversations. The implementation involved fetching
comments from Bluesky using the AT Protocol and rendering them in a
nested structure within their Astro blog. 

 ADDRESS FORMATS AROUND THE WORLD (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Address formats vary a lot around the world, with differences in
element order (house numbers before or after street names), numbering
systems (sequential vs. distance-based), and postal code formats
(ranging from 4-8 characters with various patterns). These variations
create challenges for web devs and form designers, who must
accommodate different cultural expectations and address structures
rather than assuming a single "standard" format. 

 PUBLISHERS OPPOSE W3C PLAN TO KILL THIRD-PARTY COOKIES (8 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 The Movement for an Open Web (MOW), a web publishers' advocacy group,
has filed a complaint with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority
challenging the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) call to eliminate
third-party cookies. MOW argues that the W3C's position is
anti-competitive and favors Google over smaller publishers, who rely
on third-party cookie data since they don't have access to the large
first-party data sources available to tech giants like Google, Apple,
and Meta. The complaint asks the CMA to pressure the W3C to withdraw
its announcement supporting the removal of third-party cookies,
claiming it violates antitrust obligations and Google's previous
commitments to involve competitors in privacy-related design
processes.
