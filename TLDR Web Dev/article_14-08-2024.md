ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FRONTEND SECURITY CHECKLIST (11 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A notorious hack of a fast-food chain's mobile app exposed a loophole
that allowed users to generate unlimited free meal vouchers. This
incident shows the importance of securing both frontend and backend
systems against vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and IDOR. Proper input
validation, content security policies, and secure handling of
environment variables are important for security. 

 EFFECT BEST PRACTICES (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This is a compilation of best practices, pitfalls to avoid, and code
snippets for using the Effect library. It emphasizes the importance of
using Effect for fallible operations and avoiding unnecessary use of
"any" and "unknown" types. Developers should also handle errors
appropriately and avoid common mistakes like swallowing errors and
misusing Effect.catchAll and Effect.retry.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOU SHOULD MAKE A NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Programmers should create their own programming language as a
learning exercise. Creating a language, even if it's "bad," offers
valuable insights into language design, parsing, runtime execution,
and the inner workings of other languages. By experimenting with
different language features and implementation choices, programmers
can gain a deeper understanding of the tools they use daily. 

 MAKE THINGS SIMPLER THAN POSSIBLE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Simplifying concepts beyond what is strictly accurate makes them
easier to learn. This concept originates from Dante Alighieri's work,
which in turn references Aristotle's observation that examples are not
always the foundation of an argument. Simplifying beyond truth can be
useful in the initial stages of learning something, allowing for
learning complex concepts turn-by-turn. 

 IT'S IN THE STORIES (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Leaders who go beyond their expected roles to connect with employees
are more memorable and influential than those who don't. Good leaders
should focus on producing these memorable anecdotes that carry their
desired message, rather than simply focusing on their official duties.
This article goes over various stories and examples of good leaders
who have done so.

 350M TOKENS DON'T LIE: LOVE AND HATE IN HACKER NEWS (15 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 This post analyzes Hacker News posts to understand community
sentiment and trends. Using a large language model, its author
analyzed over 100,000 posts and millions of comments to identify
popular topics, like programming and computer science, and topics that
evoke negative reactions, such as FTX and police misconduct. Certain
topics, like GNOME and Google, can generate both positive and negative
reactions because they are divisive. 

 ONBOARDING AS A WEB ENGINEER @ PINTEREST (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Rebecca Yi and Jordan Cutler, two Senior Web Engineers at Pinterest,
share their onboarding experience, detailing the structured learning
program they went through, from the first week's Pintro sessions to
launching their first projects two months later. The onboarding
program included a combination of company-wide engineering sessions
(Basecamp) and team-specific web engineer curriculum, which covered
topics like web architecture, data fetching, and performance
optimization. They both found their first projects, a performance
audit and a Pin video feature improvement, an impactful and valuable
learning experience. 

 THE C̶A̶K̶E̶ USER LOCATION IS A LIE!!! (19 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This blog post discusses the complexities of location-based
programming and the challenges of accurately determining a user's
location. There are various methods used like user reporting, device
heuristics, IP address, and edge compute. However, none of these
methods can be fully trusted due to user dishonesty, device
manipulation, IP spoofing, and the inherent limitations of edge
compute.
