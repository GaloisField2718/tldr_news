ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE REDUCED THE IMPACT OF ZOMBIE CLIENTS (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 "Zombie clients" are abandoned servers that continuously and
unsuccessfully request certificate renewals from LetsEncrypt, wasting
resources. LetsEncrypt implemented a "pausing" approach, temporarily
limiting an account-hostname pair's ability to request certificates if
repeated validation failures occur. This system included a
self-service unpause feature, allowing users to quickly resume
certificate issuance if they resolve the underlying issues. 

 MACHINE CODE ISN'T SCARY (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Machine code is not as scary as it seems. It involves understanding
instructions, registers, and memory. This article breaks down the
structure of instructions in both architectures, showing how
operations are encoded into binary data.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY I WROTE THE BEAM BOOK (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 "The BEAM Book" is a technical resource for Erlang and Elixir
systems. The process of writing it was tough, with the author having
to deal with canceled publishing deals and periods of stalled
progress. The motivation derived from understanding the BEAM and the
support from the community kept them going. 

 WRITING A POSTMORTEM: AN INTERVIEW EXERCISE I REALLY LIKE (11 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Mapbox used a blameless postmortem as a take-home exercise. This type
of exercise is great for assessing a candidate's writing ability,
empathy, and critical thinking skills, compared to an in-person coding
interview.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 90 MINUTE WORKSHOP: FULL STACK PERFORMANCE AND DEBUGGING (SPONSOR)
[8] 

 Sometimes things are broken, sometimes they're just weird. Tracing
shows you what's actually going on. Join the Sentry team [8] live on
June 10th for hands-on walkthroughs with some of the popular
development technologies – Vite, React, Bun, Neon and Drizzle.
You'll learn to use tracing to understand exactly what your code is
doing across the entire app, frontend to backend. Register for the
live workshop. [8] 

 CURSOR 1.0 (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cursor 1.0 has big upgrades, including the BugBot for automatic code
reviews and the general availability of Background Agent, a remote
coding assistant. The update also integrates with Jupyter Notebooks,
allowing code changes directly within cells, and introduces a beta
feature called Memories, allowing the tool to recall and reference
past conversations. 

 APP.BUILD (WEBSITE) [10] 

 App.build is an open-source AI agent that generates full-stack
applications using the Neon platform. It serves as a reference
implementation for codegen products. 

 THE ART OF SQL QUERY OPTIMIZATION (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Plan Explorer is a tool developed to visualize and analyze PostgreSQL
query optimization decisions. It iterates over a search space,
executes SQL queries, and generates diagrams showing query plans,
estimated costs, and actual execution times, both in a browser with
PGlite or through a proxy to a real PostgreSQL server. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHEN MEMORY WAS MEASURED IN KILOBYTES: THE ART OF EFFICIENT VISION (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 In the early days of computer vision, when memory was extremely
limited, researchers at Inria developed "An Efficient Chain-Linking
Algorithm" to extract meaningful information from images. This
algorithm, created by the PASTIS team, processed images line by line,
storing only a few lines at a time, making it memory-efficient. The
code's dynamic memory allocation was ingenious and was necessary. 

 EXPLAINER FOR LOCAL NETWORK ACCESS (20 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Chrome Secure Web and Network team has proposed a new "Local
Network Access" feature to mitigate security risks from websites
probing and attacking devices on local networks. It will require user
permission before a website can make requests to a private IP address
or loopback, unlike the previous Private Network Access (PNA) proposal
which relied on preflight requests. This approach involves gating
local network requests behind a permission prompt, giving users more
control over which sites can access their local network.

QUICK LINKS

 IRS DIRECT FILE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Direct File is a free open source U.S. government service that lets
taxpayers electronically file federal tax returns. 

 AGI IS NOT MULTIMODAL (22 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Achieving true AGI requires embodied intelligence and interaction
with the environment, rather than simply scaling up multimodal models
that lack a genuine understanding of the physical world and rely on
just symbol manipulation. 

 DOUBLING DOWN ON OPEN SOURCE (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Langfuse is doubling down on its open-source commitment by releasing
all remaining product features, including LLM-as-a-judge evaluations
and prompt experiments, under the MIT license. 

 APPLE NOTES EXPECTED TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR EXPORTING IN MARKDOWN IN IOS
26 (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Apple Notes in iOS 26 is expected to allow users to export their
notes in Markdown format, though it is unlikely to support writing in
Markdown directly.
