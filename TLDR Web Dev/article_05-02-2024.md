 SQUEEZING LAST BIT OF JAVASCRIPT PERFORMANCE FOR MY AUTOMATION GAME
(13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 An author of a web-based factory automation and economy simulation
game shares how they used various performance optimization techniques
to reduce the game‚Äôs execution time from 21 seconds to 4 seconds.
These techniques include replacing strings with small integers, using
memoization extensively, and switching to Map/Set data structures when
possible. Each optimization is walked through with a corresponding
code example. 

 CONSISTENCY (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The concept of linearizability involves translating potentially
overlapping histories of operations into equivalent sequential
behaviors. This is an important concept to understand when
implementing queue data structures. Achieving linearizability in a
distributed queue is difficult as it‚Äôs challenging to achieve
consistency without trading off availability and partition tolerance.
This post explains various consistency properties, including monotonic
reads, read-your-writes, writes follow reads, monotonic writes, and
the consistent prefix. These properties allow developers to understand
how to reason about correctness in distributed systems. 

 INTRODUCTION TO WEB COMPONENTS AND HOW TO START USING THEM (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Web components are a way to create encapsulated, reusable code blocks
for web development. They are custom HTML elements that allow
developers to define their own elements, register them, and control
them using JavaScript. The benefits of web components are that they
offer stability, independence from JavaScript frameworks, and allow
for better collaboration between UX and development teams.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WRITE CODE FOR THE WEB (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple primarily prioritizes its consumers over developers, so some
developers are shifting their focus towards writing code for the web.
The web is open and therefore cannot be locked down by corporations.
Each company has different incentives when it comes to users, which
can lead to Google not fixing certain bugs and Apple being strict
about the capabilities of developers on its devices. A strategy for
dealing with this is reducing your dependence on big company products
when they try to put you in a zero-sum game and re-engaging more with
them if they're willing to be more symbiotic. 

 BROWSER EXTENSIONS ARE UNDERRATED: THE PROMISE OF HACKABLE SOFTWARE
(8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Browser extensions are a great platform for users to modify and
personalize their online experiences in creative ways. Today, most
users use browser extensions for utilities like ad blocking and
password management. Extensions in the future should be more
malleable, where users are able to control and personalize the
experience each browser extension offers. This article shares some
tools to help developers monetize browser extensions and also create
extensions from a spreadsheet.

 THE PAIN POINTS OF BUILDING A COPILOT (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI copilots are AI assistants that use LLMs to assist with various
tasks. The development process for copilots involves exploration,
implementation, evaluation, and productization. However, it is a messy
and iterative process due to the non-deterministic nature of LLMs.
Pain points faced by developers in this process include prompt
engineering, orchestration of data sources, testing difficulties, lack
of best practices, safety and privacy concerns, and the developer
experience. There are opportunities for tools and processes to assist
developers in building copilots more effectively, such as prompt
authoring and validation support, transparency and control
enhancements, automated measurement methods, and a centralized
platform for integrating AI into projects. 

 OVER THE EDGE: THE USE OF DESIGN TACTICS TO UNDERMINE BROWSER CHOICE
(3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Mozilla commissioned a report by independent researchers that details
how Microsoft hinders browser choice on Windows. Microsoft promotes
its Edge browser within its operating system, using user interface
design tactics to discourage users from selecting rival browsers.
These tactics are not always in line with Microsoft's own design
guidelines and can harm consumers and competition. The report
emphasizes the need for global regulatory action to ensure browser
choice and competition are restored to be more fair. 

 41 YEARS IN UX: A CAREER RETROSPECTIVE (14 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In this article, Jakob Nielsen, a prominent figure in the field of
user experience (UX), reflects on his 41-year career in UX. He traces
his journey from childhood experiences with psychology and early
encounters with computers to his time as a university professor and
his transition into the real world of UX. Nielsen highlights three
significant achievements: presenting a paper on discount usability and
the 10 usability heuristics, publishing the book "Designing Web
Usability," and his efforts to raise public awareness of UX. He also
mentions his involvement with Google in its early days and emphasizes
that while technology has evolved, the mission of making computers
suitable and pleasant for humans has remained constant throughout his
career.

 WHY QUORA ISN‚ÄôT USEFUL ANYMORE: A.I. CAME FOR THE BEST SITE ON THE
INTERNET (10 MINUTE READ) [18]

 WHY ISN‚ÄôT THE HTML ELEMENT 100% SUPPORTED ON CANIUSE.COM? (2 MINUTE
READ) [21] 

 The html element is not 100% supported on CanIUse because of some
deprecated and non-standardized features associated with the element.
However, that doesn‚Äôt explain it entirely and the exact reasons are
unknown, though rounding errors are suspected as a possible cause.
CanIUse is a site that lists what HTML tags are supported by browsers.
