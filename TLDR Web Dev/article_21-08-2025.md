ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 INTRODUCTION TO AT PROTOCOL (43 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Authenticated Transfer Protocol (ATProto) is the underlying
technology of Bluesky. This article describes the core components of
ATProto, including records, blobs, lexicons, DIDs, handles, and AT
URIs, outlining how they structure data and identify users. It also
goes over the server architecture, focusing on the roles of PDSes
(Personal Data Servers), relays, AppViews, labellers, and feed
generators in processing and distributing data across the network. 

 HOW I BUILT A FULL-STACK REACT FRAMEWORK 4X FASTER THAN NEXT.JS WITH
4X MORE THROUGHPUT (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Rari is a full-stack React framework built on a custom Rust runtime
with V8. Its architecture consists of three layers: a Rust core
runtime for executing React Server Components, smart Vite integration
for RSC-aware transformations and dependency management, and true
server-side rendering with streaming support. It uses file-based
routing with automatic code splitting and prefetching, optimizing
bundle sizes and performance. 

 STATE MANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE IN NX (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nx and NgRx Signal Store provide a structured approach to Angular
application state management. The architecture in this article goes
over a library-based structure with clear separation of concerns
between data access, state management, UI, and features. It enforces
dependency rules to prevent architectural drift and allows benefits
like build optimization, testing isolation, and team scalability.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AWS IN 2025: THE STUFF YOU THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S NOW WRONG (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Security configurations can now be altered live in EC2. Instance
reliability has improved a lot, and Spot Instance pricing is less
volatile. S3 now has read-after-write consistency, deprecated ACLs,
and simpler Glacier integration. AWS networking has been updated with
better VPC options, quicker CloudFront updates, and advancements in
load balancing. 

 WHY I'M ALL-IN ON ZEN BROWSER (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This dev switched to Zen Browser after being disappointed with Arc's
shift to an AI-focused browser called Dia, which lacked the power-user
features he valued. He found Dia's privacy concerns and increased
competition unappealing. While Firefox is a reliable option, Zen
Browser offers a more streamlined, Arc-inspired UI with customizable
features built on top of the Firefox framework.

 ZEDLESS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Zedless is a fork of the Zed editor with a focus on privacy and
local-first functionality. It removes reliance on cloud services,
removes telemetry, and prioritizes user-configurable infrastructure
with disabled-by-default network features. 

 HERB (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Herb is an ecosystem of developer tools designed to improve the
experience of working with HTML+ERB templates through accurate
parsing. The core of Herb is a fast, portable, HTML-aware ERB parser
written in C that generates a detailed syntax tree. This ecosystem
includes tools such as a language server, formatter, and linter,
integrating into editors and CI pipelines. 

 TIDEWAVE WEB: IN-BROWSER CODING AGENT FOR RAILS AND PHOENIX (5 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Tidewave Web is a new in-browser coding agent for Rails and Phoenix
web applications that runs directly in the development environment.
Unlike traditional coding agents, it provides shared context by
understanding the UI state, framework, and accessing developer tools
like the database and logs. This removes the need for constant
back-and-forth between the developer and the agent.

 DRIVING AI ADOPTION AT DROPBOX: A CONVERSATION WITH CTO ALI DASDAN (8
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Dropbox had over 90% AI adoption among its engineering teams in 2025
due to strong leadership alignment and a culture of knowledge-sharing.
The company uses a hybrid approach of both external AI tools like
GitHub Copilot and internally-built custom solutions to address
specific needs in coding, code reviews, testing, and debugging. 

 “AI FIRST” AND THE BUS FACTOR OF 0 (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The "Bus Factor" measures the risk of losing knowledge if key team
members leave. With the rise of "AI first" approaches using tools like
ChatGPT, many people are becoming comfortable with a Bus Factor of
zero, where no one understands the AI-generated code. This reliance on
LLMs for code generation makes maintaining and debugging software
extremely difficult. 

 SEQUOIA BACKS ZED'S VISION FOR COLLABORATIVE CODING (5 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Zed is a coding platform that raised $32M in Series B funding led by
Sequoia Capital. Its goal is to create an IDE where code discussions
are directly linked to the code, addressing the limitations of current
snapshot-based systems like Git. Zed is developing DeltaDB, a new
operation-based version control system that tracks every edit,
allowing for real-time collaboration with both humans and AI agents.
