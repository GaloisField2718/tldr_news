 HOW WE‚ÄôVE SAVED 98% IN CLOUD COSTS BY WRITING OUR OWN DATABASE (6
MINUTE READ) [3] 

 HiveKit, a company focused on tracking vehicles and people, faced a
scaling problem where storing billions of location updates per month
became prohibitively expensive with conventional databases. To
overcome this, the company built a custom database specialized for its
write-heavy load. It also optimized storage by storing delta updates
instead of full state for each update. These changes, combined with
moving from AWS Aurora to EBS, reduced the company's cloud storage
costs by 98%. 

 HOW GITHUB COPILOT WORKS (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 GitHub Copilot analyzes code in your editor to understand what
you‚Äôre working on and then sends gathered context to a backend
service that sanitizes the input by removing harmful content and
irrelevant prompts. The cleaned prompt is run through OpenAI‚Äôs
ChatGPT API and then a final suggestion is presented in your editor. 

 REVERSE SEARCHING NETFLIX‚ÄôS FEDERATED GRAPH (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Netflix's Graph Search has improved to include reverse search
functionality, enabling precise notifications and dynamic updates for
users. By using Elasticsearch and CockroachDB, Netflix efficiently
handles SavedSearches, improving performance. The system's flexibility
also allows for expanding reverse search to other teams and exploring
responsive UIs through subscriptions.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ADVICE TO YOUNG PEOPLE, THE LIES I TELL MYSELF (24 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This essay from a software engineer gives a wide range of advice on
life topics, covering personal growth, choosing the right things, and
happiness. Generally, the author believes that effort matters more
than inherent talent and confidence stems from action. Engineers
should try to ‚Äúbe the plumber‚Äù by being someone who is trusted to
solve tough, crappy problems. 

 MY WAY BACK FROM MANAGEMENT TO CODING (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After transitioning from an Individual Contributor to an Engineering
Manager role at LeanIX, this author found that management didn't align
with their passion for coding. Despite their tough journey, they want
to encourage everyone who is willing to try out management to do the
step and not feel bad if they figure out it is not how they intend to
work. 

 IMPROVING CODE REVIEWS WITH STORYTELLING (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Adopting a storytelling approach to code reviews has greatly improved
the process for the company Doppler. By focusing on clear commit
narratives (using comments, commit messages, and PR comments), it has
made reviews easier to understand and better organized.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW STACK OVERFLOW REPLACED EXPERTS EXCHANGE (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Experts Exchange came before Stack Overflow and had a paywall model.
Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky created Stack Overflow as a free,
open-source Q&A platform for developers that was a big improvement
over Experts Exchange. Stack Overflow has its own share of challenges
with the rise of ChatGPT and the battle with ever-changing
technologies.

MINUTE READ) [13]
