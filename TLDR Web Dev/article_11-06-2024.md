 PRIVATE CLOUD COMPUTE: A NEW FRONTIER FOR AI PRIVACY IN THE CLOUD (20
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple's newly announced Private Cloud Compute is designed
specifically for private AI processing. It makes sure that computation
is done statelessly, with verifiable transparency and protection
against targeted attacks. This blog post by Apple goes over the
requirements and details of Private Cloud Compute. 

 INVESTIGATING INP ISSUES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a Core Web Vital that assesses a
page's overall responsiveness to user interactions by observing the
latency of all click, tap, and keyboard events. To address any low INP
scores, developers should focus on optimizing JavaScript execution on
the page (such as through lazy loading and tree shaking). They should
also try to reduce hydration time by implementing progressive
hydration for their components. These steps should help improve
interaction responsiveness and overall performance. 

 SHOULD YOU SELF-HOST GOOGLE FONTS? (27 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Self-hosting fonts can often be much more performant, but it requires
careful implementation of web performance techniques like
font-display: swap, subsetting, and removal of hinting. Google Fonts
simplifies this process with its delivery mechanisms, but can come at
a slight cost to performance.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT MAKES A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO A CODEBASE? (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Great contributions to a codebase prioritize well-tested features
over rushed solutions, have TODOs and feature flags to manage ongoing
work, and refactor existing code in-place whenever possible. New
changes should be broken down into digestible pull requests. They
should also have the same patterns and code style of the existing
codebase. 

 SHIP SOMETHING EVERY DAY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Shipping something, even a minor change, in your code every day
provides a dopamine rush and creates momentum. It also makes you more
personally satisfied and shows productivity to your team and manager. 

 THE CODE THAT LIVED IN MY HEAD RENT FREE FOR 30 YEARS (6 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 This developer encountered a Pascal code snippet for disk parking at
a young age but couldn't understand it. The code was filled with
seemingly arbitrary numbers and letters and it frustrated the
developer. Upon revisiting it decades later, the developer realized
that the code was essentially just invoking a system call, using
registers and arguments specific to the BIOS. It goes to show how
experience and knowledge gained in the field can often be subtle but
dramatic in approaching complex code and situations.

 APPLE EMPOWERS DEVELOPERS AND FUELS INNOVATION WITH NEW TOOLS AND
RESOURCES (22 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple introduced new tools for developers at WWDC24. Xcode 16
introduces Swift Assist with predictive code completion for faster
development. Swift 6 has features like compile-time data-race safety
for a better dev experience. visionOS 2 has new APIs and frameworks.
There are also updates to the Game Porting Toolkit 2 to make game
development easier for Apple devices. 

 INTRODUCING APPLE'S ON-DEVICE AND SERVER FOUNDATION MODELS (15 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Apple introduced Apple Intelligence at WWDC24, a personal, private
intelligence system powered by generative AI models. The on-device and
server-based foundation models are fast and efficient thanks to
techniques like low-bit palletization and adapters for specific tasks.
Apple evaluated these models through human evaluation and various
benchmarks. 

 THREAD (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Thread is a Jupyter Notebook that combines the experience of OpenAI's
code interpreter with a Python notebook. You can use natural language
to generate cells, edit code, ask questions, or fix errors while being
able to edit or re-run code as you would in a regular Jupyter
Notebook.

 APPLE WWDC 2024: THE 13 BIGGEST ANNOUNCEMENTS (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apple's revealed Apple Intelligence (personal AI) and Siri got a
significant AI upgrade at WWDC. The company is integrating OpenAI's
ChatGPT for improved understanding and query handling. iOS 18
introduces enhanced customization options for the Control Center and
homescreen, while macOS 15 allows users to mirror their iPhone on
their Mac. watchOS 11 will automatically surface relevant widgets
based on user needs. visionOS 2 brings spatial photos and ultrawide
Mac display support to the Vision Pro headset. 

 WHY TRIPLEBYTE FAILED (24 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Triplebyte, a technical recruiting company, failed due to three main
factors: it never solved candidate acquisition at scale, it pivoted to
a product that didn't meet market needs, and it tried to change user
behavior instead of catering to it. These challenges were made worse
by the catch-22 of venture capital, where the need for funding to
achieve viability often leads to pressure for aggressive,
unsustainable growth.

 ASK HN: IF YOU ARE STARTING IN 2024, WHAT IS THE MOST PRODUCTIVE SOLO
DEV STACK? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [17] 

 The most productive solo dev stack is the one that you can code the
fastest in. 

 CREATING PERFECT FONT FALLBACKS IN CSS (9 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 CSS provides properties like size-adjust, ascent-override, and
descent-override to override font metrics and minimize layout shifts
caused by font swapping. 

 THE BENEFITS OF A CONCISE CHAIN OF THOUGHT ON PROBLEM-SOLVING IN
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (32 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Researchers found that adding a simple ‚Äòbe concise' instruction to
chain-of-thought prompts can reduce the length of AI responses by 50%
with minimal impact on accuracy, leading to a 20%+ cost savings on API
calls.
