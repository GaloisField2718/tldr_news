 COLLABORATING ON APIS IS EASIER WITH POSTMAN¬†(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Whether you're a team of four or 40,000, dev teams need to
collaborate on APIs. API Collaboration [5] improves developer
productivity by empowering API¬† producers and consumers to share,
discover, and reuse high-quality API assets.

Postman revolutionizes the experience of collaborative API development
with Postman Collections [6] and Workspaces [7].¬†

Used together, they enable API design, testing, and documentation
while providing a shared canvas for collaborating on API assets.¬†

 FLAKY TESTS OVERHAUL AT UBER (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Uber developed Testopedia, a centralized system for managing flaky
tests in its CI pipelines, to address the issue of flaky tests in its
legacy system. Testopedia focuses on tracking test entities identified
by Fully Qualified Names (FQNs). It uses a finite state machine model
to capture their states. Testopedia supports scalable data ingestion,
flexible partitioning for efficient cone queries, and customizable
analyzers and ticketing systems. 

 THE GAP (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Using CSS margins to manage spacing in web layouts can be complex
with dynamic or changing content. The CSS gap property simplifies
spacing between items in flexbox and grid layouts and works well with
both left-to-right and right-to-left designs. Combining CSS gap with
margins and logical properties can make layouts more responsive and
easier to maintain. 

 AWS LAMBDA UNDER THE HOOD (24 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AWS Lambda supports trillions of invocations per month for millions
of customers. It has components like Firecracker, a lightweight
virtual machine manager, which is used to secure and fast-boot
microVMs for running functions.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ASK HN: GOING LOW-LEVEL ‚Äì WHAT TO LEARN NEXT? (HACKER NEWS THREAD)
[14] 

 The author of this thread wants to go lower level in development out
of their own curiosity. Commenters recommend various paths, like CUDA
programming, writing an OS kernel module, going deep into Android/iOS,
working on game engines, and more. 

 YOU'LL REGRET USING NATURAL KEYS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 ‚ÄúNatural keys‚Äù (pre-existing unique identifiers like chassis
numbers or social security numbers) shouldn't be used in database
design. This is because uniqueness is not guaranteed and there are
often clerical errors, like errors in data entry or data conversion.
Synthetic keys like UUIDs are always a more reliable choice. 

 NOT JUST SCALE (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Modern computers aren't powerful enough to negate the need for
distributed systems. While many workloads can fit on a single powerful
machine, distributed systems still offer advantages like improved
availability, durability, and isolation. Single-machine systems may
seem simpler, but coordination issues start to arise in larger
organizations.

 USING VECTORIZE TO BUILD AN UNREASONABLY GOOD SEARCH ENGINE IN 160
LINES OF CODE (15 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Creating a semantic search engine involves using an embedding model
to convert text into vectors, storing these vectors in a vector
database, and then querying the database using the embedding of the
user's search query to find semantically similar documents. This
article is a step-by-step guide on setting this up. 

 HAS IT BEEN 50 YEARS OF SQL ALREADY? (13 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 SQL has become the dominant language for interacting with relational
databases in the last 50 years. It faced competition from other query
languages like QUEL, but its adoption by IBM's Db2 and subsequent
endorsement by standards bodies cemented its position as the industry
standard. SQL has evolved a lot since then to stay relevant. 

 WORKING AS UNEXPECTED (5 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 A security vulnerability in GitHub's branch protection feature allows
for protected credential exfiltration. This occurs when a wildcard
branch protection rule is used, as it immediately protects any newly
created branches, making them eligible to access secrets restricted to
protected branches. This can be exploited to exfiltrate sensitive
information, such as signing keys, by creating a new branch and
setting up a workflow to access the secret.
