ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 STOP GOING TO THE CLOUD AND GETTING SCAMMED. $200 INFRA TO SERVE YOUR
STARTUP TILL 100K MONTHLY USERS IN 15 MINUTES (20 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 For many startups, the complexity and cost of cloud services can be
replaced with a smaller, simpler setup. A self-hosted $200
infrastructure setup can easily handle up to 100k monthly users
without breaking a sweat. The setup consists of PostgreSQL, a
load-balanced API with automatic SSL using Caddyserver, and Docker for
simple deployments and scaling. 

 A/B TESTING AT SCALE: HOW WE ENGINEERED A SOLUTION FOR MILLIONS OF
USERS WITH AWS (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 To conduct large-scale A/B tests without sacrificing user experience,
Unacademy engineered a solution using AWS serverless tech. Instead of
determining which test variant to show after the page loads (causing a
distracting flicker), its team selected a test variant before the
webpage even reached the user's browser. This was done by running code
at the network edge to intercept requests, determine the variant, and
fetch the appropriate content from the CDN. 

 THE TWO-TREE PROBLEM WITH STYLING ON THE WEB (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 One of the root problems with web styling is the ‚Äútwo-tree
problem,‚Äù which is the need to maintain separate, interconnected
trees for document structure (HTML) and styles (CSS). TailwindCSS
solves the two-tree problem with atomic CSS, but its composability is
limited due to potential CSS class conflicts. Styled components offer
composability, but don't solve the two-tree problem. Inline styles
combined with JavaScript can handle most styling needs without running
into the two-tree problem.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 NEVER STRUGGLE TO GIVE FEEDBACK AGAIN (EVEN TO YOUR MANAGER) (12
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Constructive feedback can be given in a way that builds trust and
strengthens relationships - even to a manager. You should ask for
permission to give feedback first before giving feedback and make sure
that your feedback actually helps the other person grow. Feedback
should be focused on specific observations paired with explanations
and actionable advice. 

 PROGRAMMING IS MOSTLY THINKING (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Developers spend most of their time thinking rather than typing code.
They read existing code, understand requirements, and thoroughly
document possible changes before making them. The actual concrete
output of devs isn't always present in the number of actual code
changes, meaning developers do a lot of ‚Äúinvisible work.‚Äù 

 DO YOU ATTACH YOURSELF TO WORK AND SUCCESS? (REDDIT THREAD) [9] 

 Most developers feel that in order to be good at their job, they have
to believe in the company's product and find their work meaningful.
Just clocking in and clocking out is difficult when work takes up over
half of someone's waking hours. As a result, they find that they
increasingly attach themselves to the work they do and the resulting
success.

 HOW DOES CHATGPT WORK? AS EXPLAINED BY THE CHATGPT TEAM (7 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 ChatGPT works by predicting the next most likely word. After ChatGPT
receives text, it breaks down the text into tokens. These tokens are
converted into numerical vectors that represent their meaning and
relationships to other words. The vectors, called embeddings, are
multiplied by a massive matrix of weights (parameters) that have been
learned during the training process. The result of the multiplication
is a probability distribution over possible next words. ChatGPT
samples a word from this distribution to continue the text. 

 I WROTE MY OWN EDITOR (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This author was frustrated with bugs, slowness, and limited debugging
features in VSCode. Specifically, slow debugging, a limited watch
panel, and a lack of GDB integration led them to create their own text
editor. Their new editor prioritizes debugger speed, flexible watch
variables, and smooth performance with large files. It already
includes core features like syntax highlighting, find functionality,
and support for GDB and other debugging protocols. 

 LESSONS FROM STARTUP FOUNDERS ON NAVIGATING THEIR CHALLENGES (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 First-time startup founders often fail due to mistakes caused by a
lack of experience. Successful founders' first startups often failed
because they tried to scale before reaching product-market fit, hired
too early, validated with the wrong people, and didn't create a 10x
better solution. Successful startups have good founder-market fit and
balance user feedback with their own product vision.
