 THE LAST DORA METRICS GUIDE YOU‚ÄôLL NEED - BY PLURALSIGHT (SPONSOR)
[6] 

 The DevOps Research and Assessment Program [5] (DORA) has become a
widely accepted benchmark to measure the effectiveness of software
development. This new guide by Pluralsight [5] covers:

	* Detailed definitions for each of the 4 DORA metrics [5]
	* Ways to improve your engineering team‚Äôs performance on each
metric
	* Using tools like Pluralsight Flow [5] to create more frequent and
consistent releases, reduce mistakes and testing time, and get updates
to end users faster.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HEADLESS COMPONENT: A PATTERN FOR COMPOSING REACT UIS (15 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The Headless Component pattern separates UI presentation from logic
and state management. This article demonstrates how to implement a
dropdown component using this pattern. It uses a custom hook called
useDropdown that centralizes state and logic management, resulting in
a cleaner and more maintainable component. This pattern allows
developers to better handle a multitude of requirements, such as
accessibility, keyboard navigation, async data loading, UI variations,
and feature extensions. 

 NEXT.JS VS REMIX: AN IN-DEPTH CASE STUDY (33 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article is a comprehensive deep dive into Next.js and Remix,
both React frameworks. It explores and compares many topics, such as
how both approach nested layouts, data fetching, and more. For
example, Remix utilizes loaders for parallel data retrieval, while
Next.js introduces React Server Components (RSCs) to handle
server-side rendering and data fetching. 

 PASSKEYS: A NO FRILLS EXPLAINER ON THE FUTURE OF PASSWORDLESS
AUTHENTICATION (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Passkeys are a new method of authentication that replaces traditional
passwords. With passkeys, a third-party service provider generates and
stores a cryptographic key pair (public and private keys) associated
with a website domain. Users can access these keys through the service
provider for authentication, eliminating the need to remember
passwords. Passkeys rely on signatures generated using private keys to
authenticate messages, protecting against threats like database leaks
and phishing attacks.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 CONFUSING GIT TERMINOLOGY (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There are various confusing Git terms like "detached HEAD state,"
"ours" and "theirs" in merging or rebasing, and "fast-forward." This
article provides explanations for these terms. "HEAD" is the current
branch, "detached HEAD state" occurs when HEAD points to a commit ID
instead of a branch, and "fast-forward" refers to an easy branch
update. The article also touches on other terms like "reference,"
"symbolic reference," "tree-ish," "index," "staged," and "cached" and
the differences between "reset," "revert," and "restore.‚Äù 

 TYPE SAFETY DOESN'T MATTER (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Type safety is valuable primarily because it moves errors from
runtime to compile time, reducing the occurrence of runtime errors.
However, type safety is not the only way to achieve this. Programmers
should also consider other bug reduction techniques, including static
analysis and automated testing, rather than being ideologically driven
towards a single approach.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ANNOUNCING DOCUSAURUS 3.0 (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Docusaurus is a popular React-powered documentation site tool by
Meta. It‚Äôs used by companies like Supabase, Redux, and Temporal for
their documentation sites. Version 3 focuses on modernizing the tool
with upgrades to MDX v3, React 18, Mermaid v10, and more. 

 GRIST (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Grist combines the flexibility of a spreadsheet with the robustness
of a database to organize your data. Its columns work similarly to how
they do in databases and cells can be filled with formulas like in
spreadsheets. 

 LIVEGREP (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Livegrep is a tool, partially inspired by Google Code Search, for
interactive regex search of ~gigabyte-scale source repositories.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW TO DESIGN YOUR COMPANY FOR SPEED (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 There are a couple of ways to achieve rapid software development. For
example, empowering engineers to design user experiences, hiring
autonomous product engineers, maintaining transparency with clear
goals and metrics, forming small startup-like teams, and focusing
resources on building rather than non-engineering roles are all
methods to ship faster. 

 THE EVOLUTION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND FUTURE OUTLOOK (8 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 This is a brief history of the evolution of software development from
the 1970s to the present. It walks through how software development
went from a niche field to a mainstream industry and describes how the
gap between product management and development is closing. Based on
these trends, engineers and managers should focus on gaining more
product perspectives in order to thrive in the upcoming AI world.

 CHROME NOT PROCEEDING WITH WEB INTEGRITY API DEEMED BY MANY TO BE DRM
(3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Web Integrity API would let websites request a token that tells
websites key facts about the environment of the user. However, Chrome
is no longer working on this API. 

 WHO INVENTED FILE EXTENSIONS IN FILE NAMES? (STACKEXCHANGE POST) [18]


 The MIT Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) had two "names" for
each file in 1961, where the second name was for processing the file.
The second name eventually became a filename extension, since at the
time, it was not separated by a dot.
