ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 JAVASCRIPT SCOPE HOISTING IS BROKEN (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 JavaScript scope hoisting is an optimization used by bundlers to
concatenate modules into a single scope instead of wrapping each in a
function, but it breaks when combined with code splitting because it
can't preserve the correct execution order of modules with side
effects. This leads to different program behavior, with shared modules
executing in the wrong order compared to unbundled code, affecting
bundlers like Rollup, ESBuild, and others. The solution requires
wrapping modules in functions to control execution order. 

 WHAT'S //GO:NOSPLIT FOR? (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Go's `//go:nosplit` directive removes the usual stack overflow check
from functions to improve performance. Nosplit functions skip the
preemption check that normally compares the stack pointer against a
limit and calls `runtime.morestack` when needed, making them about 2%
faster in hot loops but potentially much faster when the goroutine
struct isn't cached. However, nosplit functions are dangerous because
they can cause stack overflows, so the Go linker includes safety
checks to make sure chains of nosplit functions don't exceed a small
stack limit (792 bytes).

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 REFLECTIONS ON OPENAI (20 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A co-founder of Segment, which was acquired for $3.2B by Twilio,
worked for OpenAI for a year. He liked the company's bias for action,
its fast decision-making pace, its focus on practical AI safety, and
its commitment to broadly distributing the benefits of AI. He played a
key role in launching Codex, the coding agent, within an incredibly
short timeframe. 

 TO BE A BETTER PROGRAMMER, WRITE LITTLE PROOFS IN YOUR HEAD (14
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To improve as a programmer, practice writing small, mental proofs to
guarantee code correctness. Strive for code with high
"proof-affinity," making it easy to reason about and verify. This gets
easier with consistent practice. 

 NO TIME TO LEARN (WEB) FRAMEWORK X (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Learning specific web frameworks like React may not be worth the time
since they frequently change or become obsolete. Instead, focus on
transferable fundamentals like vanilla JavaScript, strongly-typed
languages, and understanding core specifications rather than
framework-specific features like React hooks. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BNA UI (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 BNA UI is a beautiful and customizable UI component library for React
Native. It has features like light/dark theme support, Expo Router
integration, TypeScript support, and zero configuration setup. 

 UZU (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Uzu is a high-performance inference engine for AI models on Apple
Silicon that offers a simple API, hybrid GPU/MPSGraph architecture,
unified model configurations, traceable computations, and bindings for
Swift and CLI. 

 REACT NATIVE APPLE LLM (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 The `react-native-apple-llm` plugin enables React Native apps to use
Apple's on-device Foundation Models for AI tasks. It has
functionalities like checking model availability, configuring LLM
sessions, and generating both structured JSON outputs and natural
language text.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT CAN AGENTS ACTUALLY DO? (17 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI agents use LLMs to evaluate contexts, suggest and utilize tools to
enrich those contexts, and manage flow control for tool usage.
Customer support and bug triaging are good use case examples, and AI
agents should be treated as software products requiring careful
design, iteration, and human oversight. 

 ASYMMETRY OF VERIFICATION AND VERIFIER'S LAW (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 "Asymmetry of verification" is where some tasks are much easier to
verify than to solve, which is an important concept in improving AI.
Examples include Sudoku, website operation, and BrowseComp problems,
where easy verification enables AI training. The "Verifier's Law"
states that AI's ability to solve a task is proportional to its
verifiability.

QUICK LINKS

 GPUHAMMER (WEBSITE) [14] 

 GPUHammer demonstrates the first successful Rowhammer attack on GPU
memory (GDDR6 in an NVIDIA A6000), enabling malicious users to induce
bit flips, tamper with data, and degrade ML model accuracy in shared
environments. 

 DEATH BY A THOUSAND SLOPS (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The curl bug bounty program has gotten a surge in low-quality
vulnerability reports, many seemingly generated by AI, which wastes
the security team's time and resources. 

 CLOUDFLARE 1.1.1.1 INCIDENT ON JULY 14, 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A misconfiguration in Cloudflare's systems caused a global outage of
the 1.1.1.1 DNS Resolver service for about an hour on July 14 due to
an error in managing service topologies. 

 10 MOST(LY DEAD) INFLUENTIAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES (19 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 This blog post explains the historical significance of ten "mostly
dead" programming languages (COBOL, ALGOL, APL, BASIC, PL/I, SIMULA
67, Pascal, CLU, ML, and Smalltalk), highlighting their contributions
to modern programming concepts and paradigms.
