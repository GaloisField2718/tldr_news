ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CACHING (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Caching involves using faster, smaller storage to hold frequently
accessed data, reducing latency. This article goes over various
caching concepts such as hit rate, temporal and spatial locality,
geospatial considerations, and different replacement policies like
FIFO and LRU. It also touches on how databases like Postgres and MySQL
implement caching internally. 

 LEVERAGING ELIXIR'S HOT CODE LOADING CAPABILITIES TO MODULARIZE A
MONOLITHIC APP (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elixir's hot code loading can be used to create client-specific
features within a monolithic application fast. This approach involves
dynamically loading and compiling client-specific LiveView apps at
runtime, isolating client code during the main app's build process. By
removing client-specific code during build time, it enforces
dependencies and makes testing easier. 

 FORGET BORROW CHECKERS: C3 SOLVED MEMORY LIFETIMES WITH SCOPES (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The C3 language has a Temp allocator, a region-based memory
management system that simplifies memory handling. This allocator
automatically resets when execution leaves its scope, preventing
memory leaks without needing manual cleanup or garbage collection. By
tying memory lifetimes to scopes, C3 is able to have efficient,
performant memory management without the complexity of traditional
methods like reference counting.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS A COMMODITY, BUT UNDERSTANDING IS A
SUPERPOWER (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While AI is increasingly accessible, the ability to understand and
effectively apply it is still uncommon. AI can generate code, but it
doesn't have the human capacity to fully understand project goals,
system complexities, and the deeper intention behind the code.
Therefore, devs who have a strong understanding of both technical
implementation and strategic purpose will be the most valuable. 

 PARSE, DON'T VALIDATE AKA SOME C SAFETY TIPS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Instead of repeatedly validating input throughout the system, it's
better to parse untrusted input into specific, opaque data types (like
`email_t` and `name_t`) at the system's boundary. This makes sure that
internal functions only handle well-defined, structured data, reducing
attack surfaces and preventing misuse of raw character pointers. 

 TAILWIND IS THE WORST FORM OF CSS, EXCEPT FOR ALL THE OTHERS (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Tailwind CSS has drawbacks like verbose class names and a learning
curve, but it is still great for teams. Its opinionated nature
enforces consistency and reduces decision fatigue.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 >_ CLAUDE CODE LETS YOU UNLEASH THE RAW POWER OF CLAUDE OPUS 4
DIRECTLY IN YOUR TERMINAL (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Run Claude Opus 4‚ÄîAnthropic's most powerful model‚Äîdirectly in
your environment, without leaving the terminal. Search million-line
codebases [10]. Create new functionality. Run tests. Build faster than
you ever dreamed you could build. Install NodeJS 18+ and then run
‚Üí_npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code_ [10] 

 MVPBLOCKS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 MVPBlocks is an open-source, developer-first component library built
with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It has reusable UI blocks and CLI
support to help devs quickly launch MVPs with customizable and
copyable code. 

 KIBO (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Kibo is a custom registry of accessible and open-source components to
enhance shadcn/ui. It wraps complex logic from various headless
libraries. 

 LANGFAST - PROMPT PLAYGROUND (WEBSITE) [13] 

 LangFast is a prompt playground that allows users to test, share, and
save prompt templates using Jinja2 templates and variables without API
abstractions. It offers instant access with no signup required and a
customizable workspace.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE'S REAPS THE REWARDS AS OPENAI'S DEAL TO ACQUIRE WINDSURF
COLLAPSES (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI's planned $3 billion acquisition of AI coding startup Windsurf
collapsed after Anthropic cut off Windsurf's access to its Claude
models, creating an opening for Google to swoop in. Google hired
Windsurf's CEO, co-founder, and key researchers for $2.4 billion
through an "acquihire" deal that avoids regulatory scrutiny while
still getting talent and technology licensing without taking equity in
the company. 

 HOW I FOUND A BYPASS IN GOOGLE'S BIG ANTI-ADBLOCK UPDATE (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 This dev discovered a bug in Google Chrome that allowed MV3
extensions to bypass the intended restrictions on
`webRequestBlocking`, a feature necessary for adblockers that Google
was phasing out. The bug exploited a loophole in how Chrome handled
WebView IDs within the `webRequest` API, allowing extensions to spoof
permissions and reinstate the blocking functionality. 

 SWITCHING TO CLAUDE CODE + VSCODE INSIDE DOCKER (10 MINUTE READ) [16]


 Claude Code can be used within a Docker container using VSCode's Dev
Container feature. This dev switched from a ChatGPT Plus/Cursor Pro
setup due to annoyances with rate limits. By using Docker, Claude's
access is restricted to the project files within the container,
minimizing potential harm to the host system.

QUICK LINKS

 NEW DATE("WTF") (WEBSITE) [17] 

 A 28-question quiz on JavaScript's Date class. 

 ZIG'S NEW ASYNC I/O (13 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Zig's new asynchronous I/O interface allows devs to inject I/O
implementations, express concurrency for potential parallelism, and
support cancellation. 

 HOW DOES A SCREEN WORK? (22 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 An overview of the history of digital displays, from CRTs to modern
LCD and OLED technologies, with explanations of the underlying
hardware principles and trade-offs involved in creating the images we
see on our screens. 

 OPENAI DELAYS OPEN-WEIGHT MODEL LAUNCH (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The planned launch of OpenAI's open-weight model has been delayed
indefinitely to allow for further safety testing and risk review due
to the irreversible nature of releasing the model.
