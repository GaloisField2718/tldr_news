ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 COMPARING AI UNIT TEST GENERATORS ON TYPESCRIPT: TUSK VS. CURSOR
AGENT VS. CLAUDE CODE (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Tusk, Cursor Agent, and Claude Code were tested in generating unit
tests for a TypeScript PR with a bug in it. Tusk, a verticalized unit
testing agent, outperformed general-purpose agents like Cursor Agent
and Claude Code by detecting the bug in 90% of runs and consistently
following codebase mocking patterns. While general-purpose LLMs are
easily accessible, verticalized agents are better for catching edge
cases and for overall reliability. 

 BUILDING ROBUST REACT APPS WITH ZUSTAND AND IMMER (10 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Zustand and Immer can be used for state management in React apps.
Zustand is more of a minimalist state management solution, with much
less boilerplate compared to Redux. Immer makes immutable state
updates easy, especially with nested data.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOUR STARTUP DOESN'T NEED TO BE A UNICORN (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There's a "missing middle path" for B2B SaaS startups, a fundraising
strategy between the high-growth VC model and bootstrapping. Raising a
small amount of capital (under $1M) while maintaining equity allows
founders to build profitable, valuable assets without excessive
financial risk or sacrificing too much time. 

 RECENT AI MODEL PROGRESS FEELS MOSTLY LIKE BULLSHIT (47 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A company using AI models for security vulnerability detection found
that recent AI model improvements beyond Claude 3.5-3.7 Sonnet have
not improved much on its internal benchmarks or in developers' ability
to find new bugs. This goes to show that current benchmarks may not
accurately reflect real-world usefulness and generality, with AI labs
probably overfitting to specific benchmarks. 

 THE BEST PROGRAMMERS I KNOW (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Good programmers get knowledge from original sources like
documentation, rather than relying on quick fixes from online forums.
They also have a deep understanding of tools and the ability to
thoroughly analyze error messages. They can break down complex
problems into manageable pieces and are unafraid to dive into code.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BROWSER MCP (WEBSITE) [9] 

 Browser MCP is a tool that connects AI apps to your web browser,
allowing them to automate tasks, such as testing, form filling, and
data collection. It runs locally and securely using your existing
browser profile. 

 BARE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Bare is a small, modular JavaScript runtime designed for desktop and
mobile environments. It uses libjs and libuv for engine-independent V8
bindings and async I/O. This allows module authors to implement native
addons that can run on the JavaScript engine directly. 

 UNCURL (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Uncurl makes sharing curl commands easy by allowing users to paste
commands, generate shareable URLs, and access them from anywhere.

MISCELLANEOUS

 20 YEARS OF GIT. STILL WEIRD, STILL WONDERFUL (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Git has evolved from a small project to the dominant version control
system in 20 years. It was originally created to improve patch and
tarball management for Linux kernel development and was envisioned as
a low-level toolset rather than a full-fledged version control system.
Over time, user-friendly "porcelain" commands were created, turning
Git into the tool we know today. 

 INSIDE THE CODEBOT: A GENTLE INTRODUCTION TO HOW LLMS UNDERSTAND
NULLABILITY (22 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 By analyzing the internal "thoughts" of LLMs as they generate code, a
"nullability probe" was created to determine if a model recognizes
when a variable could be null. From this, it was found that LLMs do
develop an internal concept of nullability during training, although
their ability to apply this understanding depends on factors like code
complexity and model size. 

 10 YEARS OF NETLIFY, FROM JAMSTACK TO AGENT DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In 10 years, Netlify popularized the Jamstack architecture and made
frontend dev lives easier. Over the past decade, there has been a big
shift from server-side development to frontend-focused teams,
especially with the rise of tools like React and Next.js. Looking
forward, AI agent-driven development will probably be the next
frontend dev trend.

QUICK LINKS

 DON'T MOCK YOUR FRAMEWORK: WRITING TESTS YOU WON'T REGRET (8 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Devs should avoid mocking framework dependencies directly and instead
create thin adapters around libraries they control and use integration
tests with real implementations. 

 TESTING FRAMEWORKS AND MINI LANGUAGES (27 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 While using testing frameworks with domain-specific languages DSLs
might seem concise, they can complicate large-scale code refactoring
and programmatic maintenance due to their added complexity. 

 TIL: ANY PROGRAM CAN BE A GITHUB ACTIONS SHELL (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 GitHub Actions allows the `shell` keyword to be set to any executable
on the `$PATH`, allowing for unexpected and potentially risky custom
shell execution within workflows. 

 WHY COMPANIES DON'T FIX BUGS (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Companies often fail to fix obvious bugs because their priorities
shift a lot and they focus on profit-generating requirements over user
experience.
