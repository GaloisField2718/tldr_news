ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW AN EMPTY S3 BUCKET CAN MAKE YOUR AWS BILL EXPLODE (4 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 An S3 bucket can lead to a massive AWS bill, even when it's empty.
AWS charges for all S3 requests, including unauthorized ones (4xx
errors), meaning someone trying to mistakenly write to your bucket
still incurs costs for you. Misconfigured open-source tools and S3
requests without a specified region can also create unexpected costs
that add up. 

 COMMON DB SCHEMA CHANGE MISTAKES (26 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Database schema changes are complex and mistakes can cause errors or
downtime. This article goes over 18 different schema change mistakes,
including common ones like leaving accidental changes in the schema or
failing to acquire locks. It also goes over more complex, specific
mistakes and how to not make them by following best practices. 

 WHY SQLITE USES BYTECODE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SQLite uses bytecode to represent prepared SQL statements. This is
because bytecode is easy to print and review. It also makes debugging
easier because it separates the SQL parsing stage from the SQL
execution stage. As SQLite is designed to run within the same process
as the application, bytecode allows SQL statements to be executed
step-by-step.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ASK HN: WHAT WAS THE JOB MARKET LIKE DURING THE DOT-COM CRASH?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [7] 

 This is an old Hacker News thread where people share their
experiences of the dot-com crash. At the time, developers had to try
much harder to get a job and learn the ‚Äúboring technologies‚Äù.
Others left the tech industry completely and never came back. Most
that were affected were either entry-level or near-retirement. 

 GROUND RULES OF FAIRNESS AT WORK (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Employees are motivated by fairness and transparency at work. This
means managers should explain how decisions are made, how compensation
works, and why recognition is awarded. They should also be as
objective as possible when making decisions that affect employees.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 THRELTE (WEBSITE) [9] 

 Threlte is a 3D framework for the web. It combines the simplicity of
Svelte and the power of Three.js to allow devs to quickly create 3D
apps online. 

 NETPROBLE LITE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 A simple tool written in Python for measuring Internet performance at
home. It measures several performance metrics such as packet loss,
latency, jitter, and DNS performance. It also aggregates these metrics
into a common score, which you can use to monitor the overall health
of your internet connection.

 WHAT CAN LLMS NEVER DO? (30 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 LLMs have an important limitation: they cannot truly generalize or
extrapolate beyond their training set. For example, they can't solve
word puzzles like Wordle because these tasks require iterative steps
with memory that LLMs can't effectively manage. LLMs also fail to
‚Äúthink ahead‚Äù and their ‚Äúthought‚Äù drifts over multiple steps
of prompting. 

 HOW DOES LINUX START A PROCESS? (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Linux starts a process first by calling the execve() system call,
which provides the kernel with a path to the executable file. The
kernel then prepares the new process and maps its relevant sections
into memory. Then, control is passed to the program, and execution is
started.

 FAKING DEMOS FOR DEVS CAN COME BACK AND HURT YOU (2 MINUTE READ) [13]


 The ML engineer that posted the Upwork task in the demo of Devin AI
has responded saying that Devin did not solve his project. 

 BLOCKIN' BOTS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This author blocked AI bots from scraping their website's content by
directly editing their .htaccess file to enforce the block, rather
than relying solely on robots.txt. 

 NEW C# 12 FEATURE PROVES CONTROVERSIAL: PRIMARY CONSTRUCTORS ‚ÄòWORST
FEATURE I'VE EVER SEEN IMPLEMENTED' (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The new C# 12 primary constructors feature (for easier class/struct
creation) is poorly implemented and less readable, according to C#
devs.
