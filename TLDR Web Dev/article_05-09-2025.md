ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT IF OPENDOCUMENT USED SQLITE? (20 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 SQLite can be used as the foundation for file formats like
OpenDocument Presentation (ODP) instead of the current ZIP archive
structure. SQLite has advantages such as smaller file sizes, faster
file saving and startup times, and reduced memory usage due to its
ability to store and retrieve data in smaller, incremental pieces.
Furthermore, SQLite allows for features like document versioning. 

 MEMORY IS SLOW, DISK IS FAST (24 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Memory is not always faster than disk, as disk I/O can outperform
memory caching in specific scenarios. Experiments involving counting
integers in a large dataset show that traditional memory access
methods like `mmap()` introduce overhead due to memory latency. By
using an `io_uring` based I/O engine to stream data directly from
disk, faster data processing is achieved compared to accessing data
from the page cache. 

 HOW WE BUILT AN INTERPRETER FOR SWIFT (A COMPILED LANGUAGE) (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Bitrig built a Swift interpreter to dynamically run Swift apps on
iPhones without requiring compilation and signing through Xcode. The
interpreter uses SwiftSyntax to parse Swift code and represents
runtime values using an `InterpreterValue` enum, handling both native
and custom types. For framework APIs like SwiftUI, it pre-compiles
calls to initializers and other functions, parsing `.swiftinterface`
files to automate the process.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHERE'S THE SHOVELWARE? WHY AI CODING CLAIMS DON'T ADD UP (11 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Claims of increased developer productivity due to AI coding tools are
unfounded. Data shows no real surge in software releases despite
widespread AI adoption. If these claims were true, there would be a
noticeable increase in new software releases and a flood of
"shovelware”. 

 I SHOULD HAVE LOVED ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This dev was initially drawn to Electrical Engineering by the promise
of hardware innovation and better human-computer interaction. However,
their experience in a Computer Science and Engineering program led to
disillusionment with the memorization-heavy engineering coursework and
a lack of connection to real-world innovation. They found more
satisfaction in software development, web applications, and research
in physics, eventually switching their major to CS + Physics. 

 SAYING NO IS NOT A FREE ACTION IN THE WORLD OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
(6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Saying no in software engineering, while important for work-life
balance, comes with psychological and social costs, making it harder
than it seems. People often avoid refusing requests due to negative
connotations, potential career risks, and the desire to please others.
Instead of simply telling people to "just say no," we should
understand the burden of refusal and create a supportive culture that
encourages saying no when necessary.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TERRAGON (WEBSITE) [10] 

 Terragon is a platform to help devs run Claude Code and OpenAI Codex
in the background. It has features such as isolated dev environments,
Git workflows, cross-platform access, monitoring, automation, and
security. 

 OPEN SWE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Open SWE is an open-source, cloud-based coding agent built with
LangGraph that autonomously understands codebases and implements
solutions, from planning to pull requests. It has human-in-the-loop
feedback, parallel task execution, and automatic issue/pull request
management. Users can initiate tasks via a UI or directly from GitHub
issues with specific labels.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MIT SAYS AI ISN'T REPLACING YOU… IT'S JUST WASTING YOUR BOSS' MONEY
(3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Most companies are failing to see a return on their AI investments.
Fewer than 10% of AI pilot projects generate real profit. This shows
that the value lies not in flashy AI applications, but in practical
uses like streamlining operations and automating tasks that free up
human employees for higher-value work. Startups focusing on solving
specific problems with AI are seeing more success. 

 ATLASSIAN AGREES TO ACQUIRE THE BROWSER CO. FOR $610 MILLION (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Atlassian is acquiring The Browser Co., the startup behind the Arc
and Dia browsers, for $610 million in cash. The Browser Co. debuted
Arc in 2022 and attracted interest from OpenAI and Perplexity before
the acquisition. The acquisition is expected to close in Atlassian's
fiscal second quarter. 

 A PM'S GUIDE TO AI AGENT ARCHITECTURE: WHY CAPABILITY DOESN'T EQUAL
ADOPTION (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There are four layers of agent architecture: context & memory, data &
integration, skills & capabilities, and evaluation & trust. Most AI
agent flows should start with a simple, single-agent architecture and
prioritize graceful escalation to humans over striving for constant
correctness to build user trust.

QUICK LINKS

 ANDREJ KARPATHY ON HOW TO BECOME AN EXPERT AT ANYTHING (1 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 One can become an expert at anything by learning through real
projects on demand and teaching what you learn. 

 VIBE CODING OUR WAY TO DISASTER (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 To avoid AI-driven code complexity, devs should prioritize thorough
problem understanding and structured planning before using AI tools
for implementation. 

 WRITING CODE WAS NEVER THE BOTTLENECK (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 While LLMs have reduced the cost of writing code, understanding,
testing, and maintaining that code, especially in a team setting,
still remains the true bottleneck in software engineering. 

 LLM VISUALIZATION (WEBSITE) [18] 

 This is an interactive visualization of an 85,000-parameter LLM that
sorts a sequence of letters and predicts the next token, explaining
the process from token embedding to transformer layers and probability
output.
