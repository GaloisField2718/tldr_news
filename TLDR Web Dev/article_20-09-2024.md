ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 INTRODUCING NETFLIX'S KEY-VALUE DATA ABSTRACTION LAYER (13 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Netflix's Key-Value Data Abstraction Layer (KV DAL) addresses
challenges the company had with datastore misuse by providing a
consistent interface layer over storage to application developers.
This abstraction offers a two-level map architecture and supports
usage through basic CRUD APIs, complex multi-item and multi-record
mutations, and efficient handling of large blobs through chunking. It
uses idempotency tokens, client-side compression, and adaptive
pagination for predictable performance. 

 COMPILE AND RUN C IN JAVASCRIPT (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bun 1.1.28 introduces experimental support for compiling and running
native C code directly from JavaScript. This allows developers to
utilize system libraries and APIs that are not directly accessible
through JavaScript, overcoming the limitations of N-API and
WebAssembly. This article goes over how Bun does it by using TinyCC
for fast in-memory compilation that provides near-zero call overhead. 

 HOW TO REASON ABOUT EXCEPTIONS (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 While every function has the potential to throw an exception, it's
more helpful to think about whether the entire function succeeds or
fails rather than focusing on individual operations that could cause
errors. Make functions more simple to improve readability and
reasoning and write clean-up code that keeps a consistent program
state regardless of how the function exits.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 STOP DESIGNING YOUR WEB APPLICATION FOR MILLIONS OF USERS WHEN YOU
DON'T EVEN HAVE 100 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 It doesn't make sense to over-engineer web apps by focusing on
scalability from the beginning, especially when the user base is still
small. Spending time and resources on building for millions of users
before even having 100 users is a waste of time and money. It is more
important to focus on creating a product that people want, gathering
user feedback, and iterating quickly. 

 STOP USING SERIAL IN POSTGRES (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 It's better to use identity columns instead of using the serial data
type in Postgres. This is because `serial` has several issues, like
permission complexities, a lack of integrity guarantees, and awkward
ergonomics. Identity columns provide a better way to manage
auto-incrementing primary keys and are also compliant with the SQL
standard.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TECH JOBS ARE GONE AND NOT COMING BACK (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The tech job market has changed a lot, with constant layoffs and
hiring freezes. The surge in hiring during the pandemic has reversed,
leading to a decrease in demand for software developers and a struggle
for entry-level positions. While companies are focusing on AI
development, leading to high demand for specialists in that field, the
overall job market for tech workers is much more competitive than
before. 

 LEGACY MODERNIZATION MEETS GENAI (19 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Generative AI can be used to modernize legacy code. This article goes
over a tool that combines an LLM with a knowledge graph derived from a
legacy codebase, allowing it to understand existing code and extract
low-level requirements, build high-level explanations, and even
generate automated documentation. 

 PAYING DOWN TECH DEBT: FURTHER LEARNINGS (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While it's important to address tech debt incrementally, sometimes a
codebase requires a significant rewrite. Rewrites like these need
management support, careful planning, and stakeholder buy-in.

QUICK LINKS

 AI-GENERATED CODE IS CAUSING OUTAGES AND SECURITY ISSUES IN
BUSINESSES (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI-generated code is causing downtime and security issues in

needed to run inference for different LLMs - this can be done with a
simple formula.
