 EXPLORE THE CODING PERSONALITIES OF LEADING LLMS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Understanding the unique coding "personality" of each LLM—where it
excels and where it's likely to make mistakes—is key to generating
code safely and securely. Check out this deep-dive study on GPT-4o,
Claude, Llama, and more to examine:

	* The shared strengths and flaws of LLMs
	* Coding archetypes for five of the leading LLMs
	* Hidden quality & security risks of using LLMs for code generation
	* How to select the best LLM model for your needs

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CONTEXT ENGINEERING CASE STUDIES: ETSY-SPECIFIC QUESTION ANSWERING
(14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Etsy explored using prompts with LLMs to answer onboarding questions
related to internal and external policies. It tested the system on
Travel & Entertainment policies and Etsy seller forums, but ran into
hallucinations and incorrect answers. While prompt engineering can
help fix these errors through specific instructions and context,
complex reasoning with LLMs still has a lot of challenges. Asking the
LLM to identify specific source snippets is a good way to flag
potential hallucinations. 

 WHY SEMANTIC LAYERS MATTER — AND HOW TO BUILD ONE WITH DUCKDB (21
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Semantic layers provide a unified source of truth for business
metrics across various tools. They are beneficial when you have
multiple consumers of data, complex business logic, and the need for
consistent metrics. This article shows a simple semantic layer using
YAML, Python, Ibis, and DuckDB to query NYC taxi data.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT LEARNING REACT WON'T TEACH YOU: IMAGE FORMATS (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Many developers neglect choosing the right image format during
development, leading to unnecessarily large file sizes and slower
website performance. JPEG is good for complex images and photographs,
thanks to its lossy compression, and PNG is great for simpler graphics
with solid colors, sharp edges, and transparency. 

 AI IS A JUNIOR DEV AND NEEDS A LEAD (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI coding assistants are like junior developers. They need clear
guidelines, detailed scenarios, and precise prompts to create
production-ready code.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN TO MINUTES WITH QA WOLF (SPONSOR) [9] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf [10].

QA Wolf's fully-managed, AI-native service SUPPORTS WEB AND MOBILE
APPS, delivering 80% automated test coverage in weeks [11] and helping
teams SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles to minutes.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [12] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

⭐ Rated 4.8/5 on G2. Trusted by Cohere, AutoTrader, Salesloft, and
many others.

 NEXT.JS 15.15 (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Next.js 15.5 introduces beta Turbopack builds for faster performance
and stable Node.js middleware. The release also includes TypeScript
improvements for better type safety in routing and deprecates the
`next lint` command in favor of ESLint or Biome. 

 EPICENTER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Epicenter is an open-source ecosystem of local-first apps focused on
data ownership, allowing users to store their data in plain text and
SQLite files. The project aims to replace siloed apps with
interoperable alternatives. Current available tools include
Whispering, a desktop transcription app, and epicenter.sh, a
local-first assistant. 

 REUI (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 ReUI is an open-source React component library built with Tailwind
CSS, Motion, and other technologies, with copy-and-paste components
designed for customization, AI-optimization, and production use.

 HOW WE EXPLOITED CODERABBIT: FROM A SIMPLE PR TO RCE AND WRITE ACCESS
ON 1M REPOSITORIES (23 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A vulnerability in CodeRabbit, an AI code review tool, allowed for
remote code execution (RCE) on its production servers. By exploiting
Rubocop, a static analysis tool integrated with CodeRabbit, the
Kudelski Security team was able to inject malicious code and
exfiltrate sensitive environment variables, including API keys and
secrets. This access granted them potential read and write access to 1
million code repositories, including private ones, through the leaked
CodeRabbit GitHub app private key. CodeRabbit quickly fixed the
vulnerability by disabling Rubocop, rotating secrets, and implementing
stronger security measures. 

 HOW TO THINK ABOUT GPUS (55 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article explains the architecture of GPUs, focusing on Streaming
Multiprocessors (SMs), CUDA Cores, Tensor Cores, and memory hierarchy,
and summarizes the specifications of different GPU generations. It
then compares GPUs and TPUs at the chip level and covers GPU
networking, detailing intra-node and cross-node collectives and their
performance implications.

 WORKING OFFLINE IN NOTION—EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW (5 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Notion now has an offline mode to view, edit, and create pages on
desktop and mobile. 

 THE STATE OF MCP SECURITY: HOW AI PLUGINS CREATE SILENT EXPLOITS (3
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The combination of multiple MCP plugins in AI agents creates often
overlooked security risks, allowing for exploits like code execution
from untrusted inputs such as emails or web content. 

 ASK HN: HAVE ANY SUCCESSFUL STARTUPS BEEN MADE BY 'VIBE CODING'?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [20] 

 Vibe coding has been great for small, focused apps and fast
prototyping, but it isn't as great when the codebase grows large.
