 🚀 FASTER MOBILE RELEASES WITH AUTOMATED QA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual testing on personal devices is TOO SLOW AND TOO LIMITED. It
forces teams to CUT RELEASES A WEEK EARLY just to test before
submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage,
issues slip through.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-NATIVE SERVICE delivers 80% AUTOMATED TEST COVERAGE
IN WEEKS [6], with tests running on REAL IOS DEVICES and ANDROID
EMULATORS—all in 100% PARALLEL with ZERO FLAKES. [7]

✅ QA cycles reduced to just 15 minutes

✅ Multi-device + gesture interactions fully supported

✅ Reliable test execution with no flakes or false positives

✅ Zero flakes, human-verified bug reports

Engineering teams MOVE FASTER, releases stay on track, and testing
happens automatically—so developers can focus on building, not
debugging.

 YES, YOU SHOULD USE SQLITE: NOTION'S CREATIVE SQLITE USAGE FOR 20%
FASTER LOADS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Notion implemented WebAssembly SQLite in its web app. This resulted
in a 20% reduction in page navigation latency. To achieve this, its
team used Web Workers to offload database operations to background
threads and a SharedWorker with the Web Locks API to fix data
integrity issues. They also addressed issues of slow disk reads by
implementing a "race" between disk cache and network requests. 

 RELIABLY REPLICATING DATA BETWEEN POSTGRESQL AND CLICKHOUSE PART 1 -
PEERDB OPEN SOURCE (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Clickhouse is increasingly used for analytics by PostgreSQL users,
and this often requires data replication between the two. PeerDB is an
open-source CDC (Change Data Capture) solution that can be used to
make data replication easy. This article goes over how to deploy
PeerDB, create test data, and set up initial replication and schema
evolution. 

 SVELTE 5 IS NOT JAVASCRIPT (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Svelte 5 introduces deep reactivity using proxies and implicit
component lifecycle state, which has better performance at the expense
of more complexity. However, these changes create unexpected issues,
such as proxies breaking IndexedDB storage and component state
disappearing in closures.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ASK FOR NO, DON'T ASK FOR YES (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Instead of seeking permission ("yes") from your boss for initiatives
within your role's scope, tell them about your plan and offer them a
chance to object ("no"). This means stating your intention to complete
a project by a specific deadline and keeping your boss informed along
the way. Usually, your boss will say yes or give some comments for
improvement. 

 UNDERSTANDING THE TRADE-OFFS OF USING TAILWIND CSS (9 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 While Tailwind allows devs to ship faster with predefined styles and
no custom CSS, it also is harder to maintain and scale in larger
projects. Thoughtfully named styles and a well-designed CSS
architecture might be better in the long run for complex projects. 

 WHY RUBY ON RAILS STILL MATTERS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Despite the rise of newer tech like Next.js, Ruby on Rails is still
valuable due to its simplicity, stability, and focus on web
fundamentals. It abstracts away technical complexities, allowing devs
to concentrate on key details of the product. Rails is great for
projects where speed and lower maintenance are the priority.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MDQ (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 mdq is a command-line tool that allows users to query and extract
specific parts of a Markdown document. It has a simple filter syntax
mirroring Markdown structure for selecting elements like sections,
lists, links, and tables. 

 DIRECTUS (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Directus is a real-time API and app dashboard for managing SQL
database content. It has support for most popular SQL databases and
layers a fast Node.js API layer on top of any SQL database. 

 ARTIFACTS MMO (WEBSITE) [17] 

 Artifacts is a sandbox MMORPG for devs where players use programming
languages to control their characters via an API. The game has a
player-driven economy and activities like monster fighting, resource
gathering, crafting, and quests. Players can automate their
characters' actions using HTTP endpoints and control up to five
characters at the same time.

 OPENAI RESEARCHERS FIND THAT EVEN THE BEST AI IS "UNABLE TO SOLVE THE
MAJORITY" OF CODING PROBLEMS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenAI researchers found that even the most advanced AI models
struggle to solve most coding problems. They tested frontier models
like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on software engineering tasks from
Upwork. While the AI models were fast, they often failed to grasp the
context and scope of bugs, creating incorrect or incomplete solutions.


 ANSWERING READER FEEDBACK: WAR ROOMS VS. DEEP INVESTIGATIONS (9
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 During a major Facebook outage in 2014, known internally as "Call the
Cops", this developer found that "war rooms" were pointless for deep
investigations. He struggled to diagnose the root cause of the outage
while confined to a poorly ventilated room with limited resources. He
needed to escape that environment and use his usual setup to
effectively investigate. The root cause was eventually traced to a bug
in the fbagent process that caused it to kill all processes on the
machine when the fork failed due to running out of memory. 

 THE CSS TRANSFORM PROPERTY AND INDIVIDUAL TRANSFORMS ARE ADDITIVE (2
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 CSS now supports individual transform properties (translate, rotate,
and scale), which are all additive. This means they combine with the
transform property in a set order—translate first, then rotate,
scale, and finally any transformations listed in transform.
