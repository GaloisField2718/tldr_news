ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE ARCHITECTURE OF DROPBOX'S LOAD BALANCING SERVICE (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Dropbox's Robinhood load balancing service improved its hardware
utilization, reducing fleet sizes by 25% and saving millions annually.
Robinhood operates by collecting load reports from services, using
these reports to distribute traffic evenly across servers based on
metrics like CPU utilization and geographic location. The performance
indicators for Robinhood include max/avg ratio, p95/avg ratio, and
p5/avg ratio. 

 WRITING SECURE GO CODE (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 It's easier to write secure Go code with tools for static code
analysis, such as go vet, staticcheck, and golangci-lint, which help
identify potential security issues and improve code quality. This
article covers the use of govulncheck for scanning code and binaries
for known vulnerabilities and introduces fuzzing as a method for
automatically testing code with randomly generated inputs. 

 THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO IMPROVE CORE WEB VITALS (19 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Better Core Web Vitals mean better web page user experiences. To
improve Core Web Vitals, focus on breaking up long tasks, minimizing
JavaScript, and optimizing rendering to improve Interaction to Next
Paint (INP). Images should be preloaded and a CDN should be used where
possible to reduce Time to First Byte.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I'VE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART REGARDING EMPLOYEE METRICS (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Tools designed to track individual work output initially may have
been predicted to identify "slackers" but they aren't a good gauge for
productivity. Instead, managers should take responsibility for their
own teams' performance. 

 PLEASE JUST STOP SAYING "JUST" (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Using the word "just" in software engineering discussions can be
detrimental. This is because "just" implies simplicity, which is very
often not the case when building software. 

 GET ME OUT OF DATA HELL (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This author worked in a data warehouse platform he calls the "Pain
Zone." It had poorly designed code, illogical data structures, and a
culture that prioritizes speed over quality. After deciding to resign,
he decided that he prefers places that respect good code and
craftmanship over speed.

work from, and use AI to customize them.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BENCHMARKING RUBY PARSERS (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Prism is a new Ruby parser that is much faster than other parsers.
It's tested against other parsers like RubyParser, Ripper, and the
Parser gem in different scenarios like parsing and walking the
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and parsing directly to C structs. Prism is
more than 10 times faster than the Parser gem and RubyParser when
parsing and walking the AST, and it is 2.56 times faster than the
traditional parse.y when parsing to C structs. 

 ANTHROPIC HIKES THE PRICE OF ITS HAIKU MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic has released Claude 3.5 Haiku, which surpasses its
predecessor in performance on various benchmarks. The company has
decided to increase the price of the model fourfold from Claude 3
Haiku due to its increased intelligence. 

 REWRITE IT IN RAILS (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This developer tried to rewrite a Rails application he was working on
in Rust and Svelte. This effort failed due to the complexity and the
lack of immediate user benefits. After returning to Rails, he realized
that while learning new tech is fun as a developer, it comes with
significant trade-offs.
