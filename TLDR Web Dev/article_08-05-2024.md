 MULTI-TENANT DATA LAKES AND EMBEDDED ANALYTICS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Multi-tenant data lakes provide a secure and scalable foundation for
customer-facing analytics [4]. Companies like Zendesk (145,000
accounts), Asana (100,000+ customers), and Zuora (1000s of platforms)
leverage this combination for efficient resource utilization, tenant
data isolation, and contextual insights, unlocking value from
increasing data volumes. Read the full article on the Qrvey blog. [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION AND JWTS (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Token-based authentication is when a user is authenticated by
presenting a digitally signed token instead of entering a password.
It's a common alternative to session-based authentication. JSON Web
Tokens (JWTs) are a popular implementation of token-based
authentication as they have a self-contained structure that includes
user data and a signature for integrity verification. This article
provides code implementations for both generic token-based
authentication and JWTs. 

 REACT QUERY AND REACT CONTEXT (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 React Query and React Context can be used together to manage data
dependencies and make component logic simpler. Combining both makes
implicit dependencies (like knowing a query has been executed
elsewhere) clear and visible in your code.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW DO YOU ADDRESS AND PREVENT FLAKY TESTS? (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Flaky tests are when tests sometimes pass and sometimes don't. Most
of the time, they occur due to tests being poorly written and not
hermetic. Sometimes, they can be due to resource constraints or data
conflicts in the test environment. To prevent flaky tests, developers
should catch them early by running tests often and reduce dependencies
on external factors as much as possible. 

 HOW REFACTORING ALMOST RUINED MY MARRIAGE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Developers often feel the urge to rewrite code they perceive as
messy, even if it's their own relatively recent work. This is because
reading code is inherently harder than writing it. However, code that
works and has been in production for a long time is often more stable
and robust than developers realize.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW TO USE JSON PATH (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 JSONPath is a language for querying and extracting data from JSON
documents. It can be used for tasks like updating OpenAPI descriptions
or writing validation rules. Its syntax is inspired by XPath, making
it easy to navigate JSON structure and find specific data. 

 HOW AI APPS MAKE MONEY (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While AI applications offer new capabilities to users, the pricing is
mostly the same as traditional software applications. Most AI apps use
subscription models, often based on the number of users. Free versions
or trials are common to drive initial adoption. A new pricing model
that AI could help facilitate is success-based pricing, where the user
gets charged only when the product delivers a successful outcome.

 IF SOMEONE'S HAVING TO READ YOUR DOCS, IT'S NOT ‚ÄúSIMPLE‚Äù (2
MINUTE READ) [13]

and adoption of your product.
