ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 OAUTH FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OAuth 2.0 authorization with PKCE is a standard way for third-party
apps to authenticate users on websites. This article starts with a
basic example of a user sharing their credentials with an app, then
progressively introduces security flaws and their corresponding
solutions. It breaks down each attack, explaining how it works and how
the OAuth flow is improved to prevent it. 

 AN SSR PERFORMANCE SHOWDOWN (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In benchmarks of server-side rendering (SSR) across frontend
frameworks, like React, Vue, Svelte, and Solid, fastify-html and Vue
are the top performers. Svelte and Solid are close behind, while React
and Preact are significantly slower. As a result, Vue and Svelte
provide the best balance of SSR performance and ecosystem maturity. 

 THE COMPLETE DEVELOPER GUIDE TO REACT 19, PART 1: ASYNC HANDLING (10
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 React 19 beta introduces new hooks like useTransition and
useActionState to streamline async handling, improve form management,
and enable optimistic updates for smoother user experiences. These

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TELL HN: BURNOUT IS BAD FOR YOUR BRAIN, TAKE CARE (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [7] 

 This Hacker News post discusses the effects of burnout on the brain,
with the original poster describing a decline in cognitive function,
learning ability, and problem-solving skills. One commenter shares
their personal experience of burnout and how setting boundaries and
prioritizing personal well-being prevents it. Others talk about
various techniques to combat it, most of which involve recognizing
burnout symptoms early and addressing them before they become too
much. 

 STOP USING SERIAL IN POSTGRES (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 PostgreSQL users should stop using the "serial" data type and switch
to "identity" columns instead. There are several issues with "serial,"
including its lack of integrity guarantees, awkward ergonomics, and
non-compliance with SQL standards. "Identity" columns, on the other
hand, offer better safety, easier management, and align with SQL
standards. 

 WHY I STILL SELF HOST MY SERVERS (AND WHAT I'VE RECENTLY LEARNED) (26
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This developer self-hosts a large number of services, including a
3-node Proxmox cluster and an external VPS. Self-hosting has taught
him valuable lessons about complex systems, from the importance of
redundant DNS to the silent failures of aging UPS batteries. In this
post, he goes over some classic technologies he works with that he
still finds relevant along with how to choose the right VPS providers.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY DON'T TECH COMPANIES PAY THEIR ENGINEERS TO STAY? (5 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Tech companies should pay their engineers more, especially those with
long tenures. Companies often fail to adequately compensate engineers
for their accumulated expertise and impact, which leads to higher
turnover and attrition. An impact-based compensation structure where
salaries are determined by an individual's contribution to the company
might be a better way to keep the best employees and pay them well. 

 DEPLOYING RUST IN EXISTING FIRMWARE CODEBASES (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google has presented a practical approach to gradually introduce Rust
into existing firmware codebases. The approach replaces new and
high-risk code with Rust using drop-in Rust replacements for C
functions. In this post, the Google team shows readers how to build
Rust code in bare-metal environments, covering how to choose and port
libraries, create custom targets, and integrate Rust panic handlers
and allocators. 

 GIVING C++ STD::REGEX A C MAKEOVER (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article shows how to wrap the C++ `std::regex` library in a
clean C interface for use in C projects. This is done by creating a
custom allocator that utilizes an arena-based memory management
system, preventing the need for individual object deallocation and
eliminating the use of `new` and `delete` within the C++ library. By
doing this, the C++ regex library can be used without directly
exposing its C++ objects to the C code while still benefiting from the
existing functionality of `std::regex`.
