ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REACT QUERY SELECTORS, SUPERCHARGED (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The `select` option in React Query allows for fine-grained
subscriptions to specific parts of data fetched from an API. Using
`select` prevents unnecessary re-renders by subscribing components
only to the data they need, improving performance. For computationally
expensive `select` functions, `useCallback` should be used for stable
references and libraries like `fast-memoize` for memoization. 

 HOW WE REPLACED ELASTICSEARCH AND MONGODB WITH RUST AND ROCKSDB (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Radar, a geolocation infrastructure company, replaced its
Elasticsearch and MongoDB setup with HorizonDB, a new geospatial
database written in Rust. This change was due to the high costs and
operational complexities of the previous system. HorizonDB was built
using technologies like RocksDB and S2, and it improved performance,
scalability, and developer experience. 

 NEXT.JS MIGRATION - CHANGELOG (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The LLM Gateway team migrated from TanStack Start (alpha version) to
Next.js and saw performance improvements, including perfect Lighthouse
scores for Performance and SEO (both jumping to 100), and a Speed
Index improvement from 2.4s to 1.1s. The switch was motivated by
Next.js' better built-in optimizations, simpler development model,
edge compatibility, and better system resource efficiency with more
stable CPU and memory usage.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 CLAUDE IS THE DRUG, CURSOR IS THE DEALER (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Many AI startups are essentially distributors ("dealers") for the
models created by larger AI labs ("chemists") like OpenAI and
Anthropic. These startups, despite high valuations and user growth,
don't control the core product or supply chain, making them
vulnerable. There are two possible futures: either the labs will go
direct, cutting out the wrappers, or models will become commoditized,
allowing the wrappers to thrive. 

 RUST, PYTHON, AND TYPESCRIPT: THE NEW TRIFECTA (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Rust, Python, and TypeScript will become the dominant programming
languages as AI-powered coding tools shift language selection from
tribal loyalty to practical fundamentals. This new "idea-oriented
programming" paradigm has the programmer as chief architect while AI
handles implementation, making strong type systems, healthy
ecosystems, and good package managers more important than syntax
preferences. These three languages perform well in their respective
domains (Rust for performance, Python for ML/data science, and
TypeScript for web). 

 THE VALUE OF INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Institutional memory is important, and there are often negative
consequences that come up when organizations forget crucial
information or processes. For example, in history, the Chesterfield
Canal disaster, Volkswagen's emissions scandals, and the Space Shuttle
explosions show how a lack of institutional memory can lead to costly
mistakes and tragedies. Forgetting can occur due to employee turnover,
technological obsolescence, deliberate deletion, or simply a decline
in activity leading to skill atrophy.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 V0.DEV -> V0.APP (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 v0.dev is now v0.app, an AI-powered platform that allows anyone to
create and deploy fully functional applications with a single prompt.
This new version uses agentic AI, enabling it to research, reason,
debug, plan, and handle complex app development tasks autonomously. 

 PANDA (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Panda is a universal and type-safe CSS-in-JS framework for web dev.
It allows writing styles using style objects or props that are
extracted at build time, generating modern CSS with features like
cascade layers and CSS variables. Panda supports various JavaScript
frameworks and has recipes, variants, design tokens, and type-safe
styling. 

 FORESIGHTJS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 ForesightJS is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to predict
user intent and prefetch content for improved perceived speed on both
desktop and mobile devices. It uses strategies like mouse trajectory
prediction, keyboard navigation tracking, and viewport enter
detection.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GITHUB JUST GOT LESS INDEPENDENT AT MICROSOFT AFTER CEO RESIGNATION
(3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke has resigned to become a startup founder.
The CEO position will not be replaced. GitHub's leadership team will
report directly to Microsoft's CoreAI team. 

 FUTURE AI BILLS OF $100K/YR PER DEV (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI coding tools are rising in cost due to constant token prices and
increased token consumption. The industry's initial assumption of
decreasing costs has been wrong, leading to throttling on paid plans
like Cursor's. Kilo, along with other open-source tools like Cline and
Roo, try to mitigate these costs by offering users more control and
cost-saving features. 

 LINEAR SENT ME DOWN A LOCAL-FIRST RABBIT HOLE (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Linear, a project management tool, is fast because it's local-first.
There are various production-ready local-first solutions for building
something like this, like Electric SQL, PowerSync, and Jazz. Despite
the trade-offs of blind servers, permanent data storage, and local
development quirks, the author found Jazz to be impressive and
productive, and plans to explore Electric SQL and Zero more.

QUICK LINKS

 CLAUDE CODE IS ALL YOU NEED (26 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Claude Code can be used in various projects ranging from autonomous
startup demos to practical tasks like bank statement organization, and
is surprisingly good as a text editor. 

 UI VS. API. VS. UAI (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The evolution of application interfaces has progressed from UI
(human-operated) to API (application-operated) to UAI
(agent-operated). 

 GO FEATURES BY VERSION (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A summary of the major features introduced in each version of the Go
programming language, from version 1.0 to the upcoming version 1.25. 

 I TRIED EVERY TODO APP AND ENDED UP WITH A .TXT FILE (6 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 The most effective system for this dev ended up being a simple `.txt`
file for daily task management.
