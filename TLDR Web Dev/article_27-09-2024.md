ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 ELIMINATING MEMORY SAFETY VULNERABILITIES AT THE SOURCE (10 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Google advocates for Safe Coding, a secure-by-design approach that
prioritizes using memory-safe languages, to eliminate memory safety
vulnerabilities at scale. By transitioning to memory-safe languages
for new code, Google observed a significant decline in memory safety
vulnerabilities in Android, dropping from 76% to 24% over six years.
This counterintuitive result is explained by the exponential decay of
vulnerabilities over time, meaning older code becomes inherently
safer. 

 HOW I BUILT MY BLOG (30 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This developer rebuilt their blog using Next.js's App Router, MDX for
content management, Linaria for styling, Shiki for code snippets, and

experience, challenges, and workarounds for each technology along with
demonstrative code examples. 

 ZERO-LATENCY SQLITE STORAGE IN EVERY DURABLE OBJECT (24 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Cloudflare's Durable Objects offer SQLite storage which allows
zero-latency database access within application code. This eliminates
network communication overhead by embedding the database directly

 OUR ANDROID APP IS FROZEN IN CARBONITE (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This indie app developer has been struggling to maintain access to
Google Drive on its Android app due to Google's ever-changing API

The situation has become untenable, so the developer is now focusing
on other platforms and a B2B model where it can control its software
development and avoid the complexities and costs associated with the
Android ecosystem.
