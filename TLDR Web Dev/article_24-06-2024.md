ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 EXPOSITION OF FRONTEND BUILD SYSTEMS (14 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Frontend build systems evolved as JavaScript codebases grew larger
and developer needs became more complex. They consist of three steps:
transpilation to address unsupported language features, bundling to
reduce network requests, and minification to decrease file sizes.
These steps are facilitated by tools like Babel, SWC, and Webpack,
among others, and enhanced by developer tools like meta-frameworks,
sourcemaps, hot module replacement, and monorepo tools. 

 SVG: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SVG is a widely supported and powerful format for vector graphics,
but it's also bloated, complex, and not well-suited for either machine
processing or direct human use. It's part of the web standard, making
it annoying for implementation due to its large specification and
dependencies on other standards like XLink, CSS, and JavaScript. The
ideal solution would be a simpler machine-focused exchange format,
potentially JSON-based, with a minimal feature set and strict test
suite for universal compatibility and easier implementation. 

 LIVE TYPES IN A TYPESCRIPT MONOREPO (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 You can use custom conditions to live-update TypeScript types in
monorepos. This involves user-defined conditional exports in
package.json and customConditions in tsconfig.json.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE TROUGH OF DESPAIR (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Improving software design to support new features is a process that
inevitably involves a temporary decline in performance before reaching
a better state. The software designer's role is to envision the
desired state and strategically manage the transition process,
considering factors like the size of improvement steps, the time to
achieve initial value, and the rate of improvement after the initial
dip. This process is called "succession" and involves making choices
about the design transformation, sequencing steps to minimize
disruptions, and balancing risk with efficiency. 

 THE REAL 10X DEVELOPER MAKES THEIR WHOLE TEAM BETTER (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The concept of the "10x developer" is a myth, as individual
contributions have less impact on project success than the quality of
collaboration. Successful organizations foster a culture of community
learning, enabling knowledge sharing and collaboration across teams.
Developers can contribute to this culture by actively engaging in
learning and sharing mistakes. 

 GETTING 100% CODE COVERAGE DOESN'T ELIMINATE BUGS (4 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Achieving 100% code coverage doesn't guarantee the absence of bugs.
This developer provides an example of a single line of code with 100%
coverage that still contains a critical error. Code coverage is not a
reliable indicator of software quality and formal verification/proof
checkers are better used for mission-critical software.

 WHY YOUR BRAIN IS 3 MILION MORE TIMES EFFICIENT THAN GPT-4 - DEAD
SIMPLE INTRODUCTION TO EMBEDDINGS, HNSW, ANNS, VECTOR DATABASES AND
THEIR COMPARISON BASED ON EXPERIENCE FROM PRODUCTION PROJECT (33
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This author initially tried chromaDB for their vector database needs,
but found limitations in scalability and build time. After evaluating
options like Pinecone and pgvector, they ultimately chose Qdrant for
its performance, ease of use, feature set, and supportive community.
The author advises against Milvus and pgvector due to performance and
compatibility issues. 

 FORMAL METHODS: JUST GOOD ENGINEERING PRACTICE? (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Formal methods are techniques used to model complex systems as
mathematical entities. While initially perceived as costly, they can
actually save time and money by reducing rework and helping with early
interface changes in large-scale, distributed, or low-level systems.
Unlike agile development, which is better suited for projects with
evolving requirements, formal design is best when requirements are
well-understood. 

 FROM THE 80'S TO 2024 - HOW CI TESTS WERE INVENTED AND OPTIMIZED (11
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Software testing was a manual process in the 1980s, with engineers
reviewing code printouts for errors. Automated unit tests became more
prevalent in the 1990s, but they were often written and run by
specialized testers, leading to slow feedback cycles. The 2000s saw
the rise of automated continuous integration (CI) servers like Hudson
(Jenkins) that enabled testing of every code change.

 I FINALLY SWITCHED TO VIM - AND IT TOOK ME ONLY 6 YEARS TO LEARN IT
(7 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This author was initially intimidated by Vim, but after multiple
attempts and utilizing different approaches like IdeaVim and a custom
Neovim configuration, he eventually became a proficient Vim user and
embraced the "Unix as IDE" philosophy.
