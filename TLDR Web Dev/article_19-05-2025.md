ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REACT INTERNALS: WHICH USEEFFECT RUNS FIRST? (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In React, parent components render before children, but children's
useEffect hooks run before their parents'. This happens because React
uses a DFS algorithm during its commit phase, walking up the component
tree from the deepest nodes to the shallowest. Understanding this can
help avoid subtle bugs in complex component hierarchies, especially
when effects in parent components might depend on changes made by
child components. 

 JAVASCRIPT'S NEW SUPERPOWER: EXPLICIT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The Explicit Resource Management proposal in JavaScript introduces
deterministic resource management. It adds `using` and `await using`
declarations for automatic disposal, using `Symbol.dispose` and
`Symbol.asyncDispose` for cleanup. `DisposableStack` and
`AsyncDisposableStack` are also introduced to manage multiple
disposable resources in a coordinated manner.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 EXPERTS HAVE IT EASY (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Novices often create unnecessary problems for themselves due to
inexperience and lack of foresight, while experts navigate challenges
more directly. Novices require patient guidance and observation of
experts, as experts often struggle to articulate their intuitive
understanding. 

 PUSH IFS UP AND FORS DOWN (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Two rules of thumb for code optimization: "push ifs up" and "push
fors down.” "Push ifs up" involves moving conditional logic to the
caller function, centralizing control flow, and potentially
eliminating redundant checks. "Push fors down" means operating on
batches of objects instead of individual items within a loop,
improving performance by amortizing startup costs and enabling
vectorization. 

 "STREAMING VS. BATCH" IS A WRONG DICHOTOMY, AND I THINK IT'S
CONFUSING (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The "Stream vs. Batch" dichotomy is misleading, as streaming systems
often use batching for performance optimization. The real distinction
is in "Pull vs. Push" semantics, where streaming systems proactively
receive data updates, unlike batch systems that periodically query for
new records.

 INTRODUCING CODEX (25 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI has launched Codex, a cloud-based software engineering agent
powered by codex-1 available to ChatGPT Pro, Team, and Enterprise
users. Codex can perform tasks like writing features, fixing bugs, and
proposing pull requests within secure, isolated cloud environments. It
is trained to avoid malicious software development. 

 BROWSERBEE (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 BrowserBee is an open-source Chrome extension that acts as an
in-browser AI assistant, allowing users to control their browser with
natural language. It uses an LLM for instruction parsing and
Playwright for browser automation. BrowserBee also has features like
token tracking, memory for efficient task repetition, and user
approval requests for sensitive actions. 

 XTOOL (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Xtool is a cross-platform tool that aims to replicate Xcode
functionality using open standards for building and deploying iOS apps
with SwiftPM on Linux, Windows, and macOS. It lets users build SwiftPM
packages into iOS apps, sign and install them, and interact with Apple
Developer Services programmatically. The tool has a command-line
interface with subcommands for configuration, development, and device
management.

 CODING AGENT IN 94 LINES OF RUBY (11 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A coding agent can be written in just 94 lines of Ruby. The agent
shown uses an AI chat loop powered by the RubyLLM gem and three key
tools: reading files, listing files, and editing files, allowing it to
create and modify code. The agent also has the ability to execute
shell commands with user confirmation, allowing it to test and refine
its code.
