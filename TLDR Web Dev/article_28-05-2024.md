ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 OLD DOGS, NEW CSS TRICKS (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 New CSS features are being introduced quickly, but developers are
slow to adopt them. This is due to browser support concerns, lack of
visible improvements, and the difficulty of adding new features to
code with existing patterns. The best way to start using these better
features is to experiment with them in low-cost environments (like
side projects) and adopt them incrementally into your codebase. 

 IMPLEMENTING REACT-LIKE COMPOSITION USING GO'S HTML/TEMPLATE (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article presents a way to implement React-like component-based
frontend development in Go using the standard library. Its approach
defines components using the define function, composes them using
templates, and manages state using URL query parameters.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT ARE YOUR TESTING PRO TIPS? (REDDIT THREAD) [6] 

 Commenters share their tips for better tests, such as making sure to
test the behavior you care about, not implementation details. Another
tip is to not fall into the ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù trap, which in reality is
an arbitrary number. 

 SHOULD I USE JWTS FOR AUTHENTICATION TOKENS? (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 JWTs are best designed for large-scale environments like Google or
Facebook. Using them for authentication in smaller applications can be
unnecessarily complex. 

 INSTEAD OF "AUTH", WE SHOULD SAY "PERMISSIONS" AND "LOGIN" (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The common use of the term "auth" to refer to both authentication and
authorization is confusing. This confusion not only makes
communication harder, but also promotes the creation of bad
abstractions that combine the two distinct concepts. The terms "login"
for authentication and "permissions" for authorization are more clear.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BIG DATA IS DEAD (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The era of ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù is over because data sizes have not grown
as rapidly as predicted. Also, hardware advancements have made it
easier to handle large datasets. Most organizations do not actually
have that much data, and even those with large datasets often only
query a small portion of it. The cost of storing and maintaining large
amounts of data is often a liability. 

 HOW WE ENABLED ARM64 VMS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Ubicloud successfully enabled ARM64 VMs with only 151 lines of code
by standardizing CPU architecture names, automating architecture
detection, and adjusting VM placement logic. It had to deal with
challenges like inflexible hardware configurations from its bare metal
provider Hetzner.
