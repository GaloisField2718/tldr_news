 COLLABORATING ON APIS IS EASIER WITH POSTMAN (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Whether you're a team of four or 40,000, dev teams need to
collaborate on APIs. API Collaboration [5] improves developer
productivity by empowering API¬† producers and consumers to share,
discover, and reuse high-quality API assets.

Postman revolutionizes the experience of collaborative API development
with Postman Collections [6] and Workspaces [7].¬†

Used together, they enable API design, testing, and documentation
while providing a shared canvas for collaborating on API assets.¬†

 AI IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AT GOOGLE: PROGRESS AND THE PATH AHEAD (8
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google has integrated AI into its internal software development
tools, with developers now using AI-based code completion for 50% of
code characters. It has improved both model accuracy and user
experience, and the company plans to further leverage AI in areas like
testing, code understanding, and code maintenance. The industry as a
whole is moving towards adding natural language as a common interface
for software engineering tasks, like fixing bugs and writing new code.


 PRERENDER PAGES IN CHROME FOR INSTANT PAGE NAVIGATIONS (25 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Chrome has reintroduced full prerendering of pages to improve
navigation speed by using the address bar, bookmarks, search
suggestions, and the Speculation Rules API. This feature enables
near-instant page loads by opening pages in a hidden background tab
and activating them when needed. 

 I TRIED REACT COMPILER TODAY, AND GUESS WHAT‚Ä¶ (21 MINUTE READ) [13]


 React Compiler is an experimental tool that aims to automate the
memoization of components and dependencies Initial tests on simple
examples showed promising results, with the Compiler successfully
eliminating unnecessary re-renders. However, when applied to
real-world applications, the Compiler struggles with complex scenarios
and requires developers to have a deep understanding of memoization
techniques and React's internal workings to make necessary code
adjustments for optimal Compiler results.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HANLON'S RAZOR - MENTAL MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Hanlon's razor is a mental model that states one should not attribute
to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity. This
engineering manager found this model helpful in promoting
understanding and empathy at work by avoiding assumptions of bad
intentions. They instead recommend focusing on improving a lack of
skills or experience instead of blaming others for mistakes or
miscommunication. 

 MY MONTH WITHOUT A SMARTPHONE (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This author replaced his smartphone with a flip phone for a month.

 HOW A SINGLE CHATGPT MISTAKE COST US $10,000+ (5 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 A startup lost $10,000 due to a single mistake in its code that was
generated by ChatGPT. This bug caused a unique ID collision in its
subscription process, preventing new users from signing up. Its
backend setup had multiple instances, which masked the problem during
the day due to frequent deployments but caused it to surface at night
when deployments stopped. 

 THE BACKROOMS OF THE INTERNET ARCHIVE (6 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 The Backrooms is an internet legend based on an image of an empty
series of rooms, which gained popularity in 2019 when it was connected
to a ‚Äúcreepypasta‚Äù story about an endless, maze-like dimension.
This led to the creation of numerous games and videos based on the
Backrooms concept, which often went viral. However, the mystery of the
original photograph was recently solved - it was found to have been
taken in 2003 during the renovation of a furniture store in Wisconsin
and preserved by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. 

 THE WEIRD NERD COMES WITH TRADE-OFFS (11 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Katalin Karik√≥, a Nobel Prize winner, faced criticism for expressing
her dislike for the political aspect of academia, highlighting the
challenges faced by "Weird Nerds" in such environments. ‚ÄúWeird
Nerds‚Äù have an unyielding devotion to Truth, often placing it above
social graces or conventional norms. These individuals usually have
unique talents and intellectual courage, but struggle with the social
and political aspects of academic life. A lack of "Weird
Nerd-friendly" environments can hinder their contributions and
potentially lead to a loss of valuable talent.
