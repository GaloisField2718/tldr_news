 HOW WE SURVIVED 10K REQUESTS A SECOND: SWITCHING TO SIGNED ASSET URLS
IN AN EMERGENCY (11 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This developer's Google Cloud Storage bill skyrocketed due to someone
downloading thousands of images per second from his public bucket. To
prevent future abuse, he implemented a solution that generates
temporary, signed URLs for images that expire after a set period, and
then redirected users through a Rails application. He also added rate
limiting to the API and website. 

 CSS GRID AREAS (16 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CSS Grid Template Areas lets you define your grid layout using named
areas, making it more intuitive for complex layouts. It also
simplifies creating responsive layouts by allowing adjustments to grid
area definitions based on screen sizes. This article goes over the
basics of CSS Grid Areas with lots of visual examples. 

 JUST USE POSTGRES (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Postgres today is powerful enough to be the default choice for new
applications requiring persistent data storage. NoSQL databases like
DynamoDB, Cassandra, and MongoDB are not recommended for applications
requiring high scalability and specific access patterns because data
modeling gets too complex and analytics is tough. This article goes
through other alternatives, like Oracle DB and Kafka, to show how
Postgres is better.

 POSTMORTEM OF MY 9 YEAR JOURNEY AT GOOGLE (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This former Google engineer reflects on his 9-year journey at the
company. The pros include high compensation, great perks, and the
opportunity to build a team. The cons include burnout, a USA-centric

 GOOD PROGRAMMERS WORRY ABOUT DATA STRUCTURES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Linus Torvalds (the creator of Git and Linux) says that data
structures are more important than code in software development since
good data structures lead to better code design and maintainability.
This article supports this view with personal experience, describing
how restructuring data in a project allowed a team to move faster in
the long run. This prioritization is also how Git grew to be the
dominant version control system. 

 AN UNORDERED LIST OF THINGS I MISS IN GO (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This developer expresses their fondness for Go but also lists
features they miss from other languages. They find the lack of ordered
maps in Go's standard library inconvenient, requiring developers to
use third-party implementations or manually sort maps. The developer
also misses keyword and default arguments for functions, which would
simplify function calls and improve API design. They also wish there
was lambda syntax in Go.

 FORMER GOOGLE CEO ERIC SCHMIDT'S LEAKED STANFORD TALK (65 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, recently had a talk at
Stanford. This is the transcript of the talk, in which he discusses
the rapid advancements in AI and its potential impact on the world. He
predicts that within the next year or two, significant changes will
arise due to the integration of three key AI advancements: large
context windows, AI agents, and text-to-action capabilities. He also

 PYTORCH IS DEAD. LONG LIVE JAX. (24 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The PyTorch framework was initially successful for rapid prototyping,
but now has a better successor in JAX, a framework created by Google
DeepMind. JAX has a compiler-driven approach, which allows for
automatic optimization and parallelization. It also has a functional
API, better reproducibility, portability across different hardware,
and automatic scaling. 

 THE SHORTEST, STRANGEST ENGINEERING INTERVIEW I'VE EVER DONE (10
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This interviewer had a bizarre interview with a candidate named Adam.
Adam was critical of the interview process, claiming it was too long
and unnecessary, and that he could assess a developer's skills simply
by looking at their GitHub profile. Despite the interviewer's attempts
to explain his process and adjust it to Adam's preferences, Adam
abruptly ended the interview, claiming it wouldn't be a good fit.
After the call, Adam sent an aggressive email criticizing the
interviewer's interview style and even his open source work.
