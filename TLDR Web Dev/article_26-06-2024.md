ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 UUIDV7 IN 33 LANGUAGES (25 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 UUIDv7 is a 128-bit unique identifier designed to be time-sortable
with 1 ms precision, making it suitable for use in databases,
including distributed systems. Unlike its predecessor UUIDv4, UUIDv7
integrates both timestamp and random components, ensuring sequential
ordering based on time. This makes UUIDv7 a great option for
generating unique identifiers for database records that require
precise chronological ordering. 

 ENHANCING NETFLIX RELIABILITY WITH SERVICE-LEVEL PRIORITIZED LOAD
SHEDDING (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Netflix initially implemented prioritized load shedding at the API
gateway level, then extended it to individual service level for
finer-grained control and better cloud capacity utilization. One
example is its PlayAPI, which prioritized user-initiated requests over
pre-fetch requests during an infrastructure outage, maintaining high
availability for critical requests. Netflix also created an internal
library for prioritized load shedding and experimented with CPU-based
and IO-based load shedding. 

 UB OR NOT UB: HOW GCC AND CLANG HANDLE STATICALLY KNOWN UNDEFINED
BEHAVIOR (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Undefined behavior (UB) in C code allows compilers to optimize code
based on the assumption that no UB exists, potentially removing
conditions or altering program flow. However, the handling differs
between compilers if the compiler statically detects UB, like division
by zero: GCC tends to crash the program, while Clang may ignore the
undefined code or continue compiling, potentially leading to
unexpected results later. This differing behavior is due to different
philosophies - LLVM aims for more lenient handling to match developer
expectations, while GCC takes a more conservative approach.

engineers to improve automation efficiency in their teams, including a
Slack notification system for failing tests, a visual regression
testing tool using Selenium and JIMP, a Windows application to
automate terminal emulators, and a script to automatically generate
API tests from a Swagger file.

 WHAT AI ENGINEERS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT SEARCH (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article goes over the basics of search for engineers. Search
involves various aspects like judging relevance, dealing with
different information needs, and optimizing metrics like precision and
recall. Click models can help understand user behavior, while BM25 is
a popular lexical similarity score used in search. 

 1-CLICK EXPLOIT IN SOUTH KOREA'S BIGGEST MOBILE CHAT APP (12 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The KakaoTalk Android app had a vulnerability that allowed attackers

victim's account and read their chat messages. 

 GENERAL MANAGEMENT, FUNCTIONAL, AND HYBRID MODELS: WHICH ORG DESIGN
