 OBSERVABILITY FOR AWS MICROSERVICES: HOW TO REDUCE COSTS AND
COMPLEXITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Observability is non-negotiable when you're working with
microservices. But if it's not managed correctly, it can become a
budget and time sink that's hard to justify.

Join Lumigo's tech team for a live and lively discussion [4] covering:

 	* Adopting advanced observability tools
 	* Enhancing distributed tracing and monitoring [4]
 	* Fostering a culture of observability
 	* Ensuring scalability and flexibility
 	* Implementing AI and machine learning [4]
 	* Managing cost without sacrificing visibility

This webinar will provide the knowledge and tools to future-proof your
observability practices through real-world examples and expert
insights.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW A SINGLE LINE OF CODE BROUGHT DOWN A BILLION DOLLAR ROCKET (10
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article goes over major software bugs in the real world. For
example, the Ariane 5 rocket exploded in 1996 due to a software error,
causing a major financial loss and delaying scientific research. An
airline was grounded for 3 hours due to an uncaught SQLException in
its core system, highlighting the importance of error handling and
system isolation. The Boeing 737 MAX crashes were partially caused by
a flawed software system (MCAS). 

 ODIN: UBER'S STATEFUL PLATFORM (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Uber created Odin to automate and simplify the management of its
giant data storage infrastructure. Odin is designed to be declarative
and self-healing, continuously working to align the actual state of
workloads with their intended goal states. Odin's control plane is
divided into global and host-level components, with two agents - one
technology-agnostic and the other technology-specific - working
together to manage workload scheduling, cluster topology, and resource
allocation. 

 SNEAKY REACT MEMORY LEAKS: HOW USECALLBACK AND CLOSURES CAN BITE YOU
(9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Closures combined with the useCallback hook in React can cause hidden
memory leaks by holding onto large objects in the component's context,
preventing garbage collection. Memoized functions may inadvertently
reference each other and shared data, creating an endless chain of
closures. To avoid such issues, keep closure scopes small, avoid
unnecessary memoization, and consider using useRef for large objects.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 POST-ARCHITECTURE: PREMATURE ABSTRACTION IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL (18
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Post-Architecture is an approach to software development that
prioritizes incremental design over premature abstraction. It focuses
on procedural programming with a functional flavor, focusing on data
structures rather than code patterns, and identifying data flows to
guide development. 

 TRUST AS A BOTTLENECK TO GROWING TEAMS QUICKLY (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Trust is necessary for effective collaboration as teams grow. A lack
of trust can hinder productivity. Trust allows for efficient
delegation and decision-making, especially in high-pressure
situations. However, building trust isn't easy because it requires
proactive effort, being reliable, sharing mental models, communicating
openly, and giving feedback. 

 EMBRACING FUNCTIONAL CSS: HAVE WE MOVED ON? (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Functional CSS, or utility-first CSS, simplifies styling by using
small, reusable classes for specific purposes. Tailwind CSS and
Tachyons are examples of functional CSS frameworks. They're still
popular today because of how easy they are to pick up and use.

 WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO RECREATE BELL LABS? (32 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Bell Labs was a highly successful industrial research lab that made
numerous groundbreaking inventions and discoveries in the 20th
century. Its success was due to several factors, including being a
subsidiary of AT&T, a government-sanctioned monopoly, which allowed
for long-term research projects and a broad research scope. The lab
also benefited from historical circumstances like the advancement of
quantum mechanics and the influx of talented European physicists after
WWII. However, the lab's decline began after the breakup of AT&T in
1982, as it was repeatedly reorganized and faced increasing financial
pressure. 

 OVERCOMING THE LIMITS OF CURRENT LLMS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 LLMs like ChatGPT have limitations, like hallucinations, lack of
confidence estimates, and the absence of citations. One approach to
address these limitations is to bootstrap consistent LLMs by training
them on carefully curated datasets that exclude contradicting
information. This could be achieved by starting with a small,
high-quality corpus and gradually expanding it using the base model to
classify new text documents as consistent or inconsistent. 

 THE ECONOMICS OF A POSTGRES FREE TIER (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Xata offers a sustainable free tier for its Postgres and OpenSearch
database services by utilizing shared clusters that efficiently host
multiple databases. It manages costs effectively through careful
cluster management and automation, distinguishing between active and
inactive databases to optimize resource allocation.

 USPS SHARED CUSTOMER POSTAL ADDRESSES WITH META, LINKEDIN, AND SNAP
(4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 USPS shared postal addresses with Meta, LinkedIn, and Snap through
hidden tracking pixels, but it stopped after an investigation by
TechCrunch, claiming the company was unaware of it. 

 WHY CODING EXERCISES IN TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS ARE A TERRIBLE IDEA (2
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Coding exercises in technical interviews can be unfair to those
without ample practice time outside of their jobs, like those with
families and kids. 

 MICROSOFT BUILDS TOOL TO LET LLMS ANALYZE SPREADSHEETS (4 MINUTE
READ) [21] 

 Microsoft researchers created SpreadsheetLLM, a tool that uses large
