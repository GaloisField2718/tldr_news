ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 A CRASH COURSE ON DATABASE QUERY OPTIMIZATION BASICS (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 As databases grow, query optimization becomes more important to
combat slow data retrieval and loading times. There are various
strategies to optimize queries, including index creation, analyzing
query execution plans, and understanding specific database engine
optimization techniques. This article uses a real-world example to
show how to optimize a query from start to finish. 

 THE ADVANTAGES OF QUEUES ON LOGS (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While logs and queues share temporal ordering, they differ
fundamentally. Queues adhere to a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle,
allowing for sequential consumption from the head or tail. In
contrast, logs require readers to maintain a pointer and read by
position rather than by order of arrival. This distinction leads to
advantages in scalability when implementing logs as queues,
particularly in enabling parallel consumption and efficient load
distribution among multiple consumers without necessitating knowledge
of the internal structure. Additionally, queues offer benefits such as
replay and durability, explored in detail in the article. 

 TOO DANGEROUS FOR C++ (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article compares Rust's memory safety with C++ by illustrating a
scenario involving an internal library written in Rust. Initially, the
author used Rust's ‚ÄúRc‚Äù type for reference counting but
encountered thread safety issues. Upon switching to Rust's ‚ÄúArc‚Äù
type, which provides atomic reference counting, the compiler enforced
thread safety, ensuring data race conditions were prevented at compile
time. C++ lacks such safety features, relying on developers to
manually handle thread safety, which can lead to subtle bugs and
undefined behavior. Rust's borrow checker and type system statically
prevents data races, making it unique among programming languages.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY WRITE SMALL DIFFS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Small diffs facilitate faster and more thorough code reviews, reduce
the likelihood of introducing bugs, minimize merge conflicts, and make
it easier to roll back changes if needed. While there may be
exceptions for large diffs, such as when adding boilerplate or
auto-generated code, the general rule is to aim for small, focused
changes to codebases. 

 WHY ELIXIR IS THE BEST LANGUAGE FOR BUILDING A BOOTSTRAPPED, B2B SAAS
IN 2024 (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Elixir is a great language for simplified web app development as it
allows developers to collapse the tech stack through features like
Phoenix LiveView, built-in concurrency and fault tolerance, and
integration with familiar tools. The language also has a fairly stable
ecosystem with mature tooling to speed up development, making it ideal
for bootstrapped startups. 

 (ALMOST) EVERY INFRASTRUCTURE DECISION I ENDORSE OR REGRET AFTER 4
YEARS RUNNING INFRASTRUCTURE AT A STARTUP (19 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 An infrastructure lead had to make various infrastructure decisions
for a startup over the past four years. He endorses choosing AWS, RDS,
and Redis ElastiCache, but regrets opting for other things, like
AWS‚Äôs premium support. He also recommends considering dependency
management and identity platforms earlier rather than later in order
to save the company from a painful migration later on.

 GOOGLE AND AI | ELON MUSK ON TESLA COMP (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A Google engineer named Eric Lehman warned in 2018 that AI posed a
serious threat to Google's search dominance. This concern stemmed from
Google's BERT project, which achieved impressive results in web
answers (featured snippets). Lehman urged proactive measures to avoid
being blindsided by a potential competitor, even a startup, using a
similar approach. While Google acknowledged the threat, Lehman
eventually left the company in 2022. This internal email highlights
Google's early concerns about AI disruption and foretells the rise of
alternative search engines like Perplexity, which capitalize on
unsupervised learning from raw text. 

 DEVELOPERS ARE IN OPEN REVOLT OVER APPLE‚ÄôS NEW APP STORE RULES (6
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 European app developers are expressing discontent with Apple's new
App Store rules, criticizing Apple's fees and restrictions. Despite
the potential for alternative app stores and payment systems,
developers feel pressured to adhere to Apple's terms to avoid warnings
and fees. Apple is defending its changes as compliant with regulations
and necessary for user security. 

 IS THE "MODERN DATA STACK" STILL A USEFUL IDEA? (13 MINUTE READ) [18]


 The ‚ÄúModern Data Stack‚Äù is a set of products that redesign the
analytics workflow to take advantage of the cloud that all interact
with one another via SQL. The term is no longer useful because most
data products today are cloud-based. The next phase of the Modern Data
Stack will focus on AI, the broader analytics space, and specific
product categories.

 THE CASE FOR DESIGN ENGINEERS, PT. II (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Design engineers are crucial for creating interactive features in web
interfaces. They can design and code at the same time, ensuring that
the final product feels intentional and well-designed. 

 UNDERSTANDING COMPLEXITY LIKE AN ENGINEER ‚Äì THE CASE OF THE
LADYBIRD BROWSER (5 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 A group of volunteers led by a former Safari developer embarked on
building SerenityOS and Ladybird browser from scratch to understand
complexity. After encountering a crash while testing, the author of
this article delved into the code, identified a CSS compliance issue,
and collaborated with the developers to resolve it. The lesson for
developers is that if you are motivated and skilled, you can
single-handedly get very far. No complexity is too much to be
understood. 

 BIG TECH JOBS HAVE LOST THEIR GLAMOR (6 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Big Tech is losing its luster compared to the past due to layoffs,
disillusionment among employees, and stagnant career growth.

BIZARRE PERSONALITY TEST (REDDIT POST) [22] 

 A Reddit user had to take a personality test for FedEx‚Äôs software
engineering role that had them pick whether characters in displayed
images represented them or not.
