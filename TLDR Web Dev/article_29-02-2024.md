 EXPLORING NEXT.JS FORMS WITH SERVER ACTIONS (23 MINUTE READ) [5]

React Server Components (RSC), and Server Actions. It covers
React/Next native aspects like useFormStatus, useFormState, and

error handling on a fine- and coarse-grained level, and staying
functional without JavaScript in the browser. 

 CSS :HAS() INTERACTIVE GUIDE (20 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The CSS :has() selector is a method for targeting and styling
elements based on the presence of specific descendants. It opens up a
wide range of new possibilities that weren't possible with traditional
CSS selectors. For example, it can be used to customize file icons
based on their extension without JavaScript and change a modal‚Äôs
appearance based on certain actions. 

 SCHEDULING INTERNALS (21 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post dives into the internals of scheduling and concurrency,
showing readers how to handle millions of clients concurrently with
just a single thread. It begins by exploring the challenges of
creating a server that can handle multiple clients concurrently using
threads, going over concepts like stack allocation, performance, and
resource management. It then introduces the concept of async I/O,
demonstrating how non-blocking sockets can be utilized to achieve
concurrency without threads. Code examples are provided to demonstrate
the points made.

reflects on their 12 years at Meta. They transformed image tagging on
Facebook and championed open-source, leading to the creation and

 ENGINEERS, JOINING AN EARLY-STAGE STARTUP ISN‚ÄôT FINANCIALLY WORTH
IT! (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Joining a startup for financial upside is generally not worthwhile
compared to staying in Big Tech, since you only get the cash equity if
the startup goes public or gets bought out, which takes a long time.
Founding engineers usually receive 0.5% equity, which means it takes a
$200 million company exit to get $1 million personally. However,
joining a startup is great for personal growth. This article includes
tips on how to pick the right startup to join.

 HOW VIDEO GAMES USE LUTS AND HOW YOU CAN TOO (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 LUTs are simple data tables that remap colors or values. They offer a
