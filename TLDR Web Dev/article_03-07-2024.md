 OPTIMIZING JAVASCRIPT FOR FUN AND FOR PROFIT (28 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Optimizing JavaScript code for performance often involves trade-offs
with readability. Careful benchmarking is necessary to identify
bottlenecks and measure improvements. Common optimization techniques
include avoiding string comparisons and different object shapes,
minimizing the use of array and object methods, reducing indirection,
and optimizing memory access patterns. Using eval() strategically and
understanding the nuances of string manipulation can lead to better
performance. 

 5 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT REACT SERVER COMPONENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 React Server Components (RSC) are primarily server-side components
that optimize performance by fetching data and rendering on the
server, while Client Components handle interactivity and state
management on the client side. In the RSC paradigm, Server Components
are the default, and Client Components are explicitly marked using
'use client'. While Server Components cannot be directly nested within
Client Components, they can be passed as props to Client Components. 

 MILLION.JS ADOPTION GUIDE: OVERVIEW, EXAMPLES, AND ALTERNATIVES (6
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Million.js is a minimalistic JavaScript compiler that improves
React's performance by reducing memory usage and enhancing rendering
speed through a granular approach to DOM updates. It uses optimized
higher-order components called blocks to achieve these performance
gains.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MOCKING IS AN ANTI-PATTERN (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mocking in tests, particularly for IO operations, can lead to a false
sense of security as it often fails to cover edge cases and failure
modes of the real service. Instead of relying on mocks, developers
should prioritize thorough unit testing and use alternatives like
in-memory databases or virtual file systems for simpler IO testing. 

 WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY OVER 30 YEARS (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 FreeDOS, an open source version of DOS, is turning 30 years old. The
project was started in 1994 by Jim Hall, who wanted to preserve the
command line experience after Microsoft stopped developing DOS. Over
the years, FreeDOS has thrived due to its strong community. To keep
the project going, the FreeDOS team maintains a website, shares
updates on social media, and actively solicits contributions from
developers. 

 HOW DO I REACH OUT TO SOMEONE WHEN I WANT TO NETWORK WITH THEM? (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Networking offers opportunities for advice, mentorship, and job
prospects. To cold contact someone, you should create thoughtful,
respectful messages via email or LinkedIn. Also, try to utilize your
alumni networks and/or personal connections if possible.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NEW TO THE WEB PLATFORM IN JUNE (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The web platform saw new features and improvements in June, such as
new JavaScript Set methods and color interpolation in CSS gradients. 

 CHANGESETS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Changesets is a tool to manage versioning and changelogs. It's
focused on multi-package repositories. 

 TYPESPEC (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 TypeSpec is a language created by Microsoft for defining cloud
service APIs and shapes. It's an extensible language with primitives
that can describe API shapes common among REST, OpenAPI, gRPC, and
other protocols.

 WHY AI INFRASTRUCTURE STARTUPS ARE INSANELY HARD TO BUILD (8 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Building venture-scale AI infrastructure startups is extremely
difficult because startups lack the differentiation and capital needed
to compete with established players like GCP, AWS, Vercel, Databricks,
and Datadog, who are all striving to create end-to-end AI platforms.
The open-source community quickly replicates any promising
innovations, further eroding the competitive advantage of startups. To
survive, startups must either focus on a very narrow niche, raise
substantial VC funding, or remain bootstrapped. 

 TOTAL ANNIHILATION GRAPHICS ENGINE (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Total Annihilation graphics engine was developed before hardware
acceleration was widely available. The engine used a mix of fixed and
floating-point math, with some assembly code optimizations. Due to the
8-bit palette limitation, various tricks like lookup tables were used
for effects like alpha blending and shadows. To improve performance,
unit rendering was optimized by caching 3D models as sprites and using
z-buffering for self-intersection. This article continues to go
through the various innovations of the graphics engine back then. 

 HOW TO HIRE AI ENGINEERS (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI engineers don't need deep machine learning expertise. Instead,
they should have practical experience in building complex systems (on
the web or otherwise) and also have a genuine curiosity for working
with LLMs. A good hiring process for AI engineers focuses on assessing
candidates' technical skills in scalable system development, their
proficiency in asynchronous programming and distributed systems, and
their readiness to tackle challenges in integrating LLMs into
applications.
