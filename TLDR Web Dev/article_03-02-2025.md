ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FALSEHOODS PROGRAMMERS BELIEVE ABOUT NULL POINTERS (12 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Null pointer behavior is usually more complex than expected.
Optimizations, platform-specific quirks, and the evolution of
standards have created numerous edge cases and unexpected behaviors,
particularly in C and C++. These misconceptions range from simple
assumptions about program crashes to the intricacies of null pointer
addresses and pointer provenance. Developers should avoid relying on
intuition when it comes to null pointers and check docs diligently
instead. 

 HOW ARE IMAGES REALLY STORED? (42 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article explains how images are stored, starting with the
fundamental concept that pixels are the smallest units of color.
Grayscale images store one byte per pixel, while color images use RGB
(or RGBA) triplets, which require three or four bytes per pixel. Image
formats like GIF use palettes to reduce storage by indexing colors,
while PNG employs Deflate compression after applying filters to
minimize pixel differences before compression. JPEG achieves high
compression ratios through chroma subsampling (reducing color
information) and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), which exploit
the human eye's lower sensitivity to color detail. 

 THE MODERN WAY TO WRITE JAVASCRIPT SERVERS (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article advocates for a modern JavaScript server API based on
the Request/Response model, contrasting it with Node.js's traditional
approach. The new API avoids socket binding, which simplifies testing
by allowing server functions to be tested directly with simple object
inputs and outputs. Benchmark results show the Request/Response API is
substantially faster.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 UNEXPECTED BENEFITS OF BUILDING YOUR OWN TOOLS (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Building your own custom tools has its benefits. For example, this
developer created a simple exploit editor for his game which
drastically sped up his workflow and enabled higher-quality content
creation through increased iteration. A utility he created for
managing embedded devices at his day job eliminated tedious tasks for
him. 

 HELL IS OVERCONFIDENT DEVELOPERS WRITING ENCRYPTION CODE (11 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 When devs write their own encryption code, it often leads to security
issues. A recent example of a startup's flawed encryption
implementation shows this, despite its claim of not "rolling its own
crypto." People should use better, readily available cryptographic
tools to prevent these recurring mistakes. 

 ADD F*CKING TO YOUR GOOGLE SEARCHES TO NEUTRALIZE AI SUMMARIES (9
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Including expletives in Google search queries prevents Google's
AI-generated summaries from appearing. This method is simpler than
previously discovered techniques for disabling AI summaries. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LUME (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Lume is a CLI and local API server for creating, managing, and
running macOS and Linux virtual machines (VMs) on Apple Silicon using
Apple's Virtualization.Framework. It offers a range of commands for VM
creation, management (including starting, stopping, and deleting),
image pulling, and configuration modification. 

 EARTHSTAR (WEBSITE) [16] 

 Earthstar is a database for private, distributed, offline-first
applications. It offers a new specification for building user-owned,
connected applications. Earthstar uses a JavaScript library and
prioritizes offline functionality, data deletion, and self-hosting. 

 PAGE ASSIST (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Page Assist is an open-source browser extension that enables
interaction with local AI models from any webpage. With a sidebar and
a ChatGPT-like web UI, it supports various Chromium-based and Firefox
browsers and allows users to chat with webpages, ask questions about
content, and use features such as default keyboard shortcuts.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EVERYONE KNOWS YOUR LOCATION: TRACKING MYSELF DOWN THROUGH IN-APP ADS
(11 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This author investigated the geolocation data leak from Gravy
Analytics and found several apps on his phone secretly transmitting
his location data without consent. He then attempted to purchase his
own location data from data brokers but found the cost too high. The
author discovered that even with location services disabled, his
location and IP address were still being shared with numerous ad
platforms and companies. His investigation revealed that this data is
collected and resold through a complex system that involves
supply-side platforms like Unity Ads and demand-side platforms like
Moloco Ads. 

 CHATBOT SOFTWARE BEGINS TO FACE FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS (11 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 LLMs are showing fundamental limitations in solving complex,
multi-step reasoning problems, particularly those requiring
compositional tasks. Research shows that LLMs struggle with these
tasks because their underlying transformer architecture has inherent
mathematical limits on their ability to handle increasingly complex
computations. While techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and
embedding tricks can improve performance on some tasks, these are
essentially workarounds, not solutions to the core limitations. 

 LIFE IS MORE THAN AN ENGINEERING PROBLEM (26 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Science fiction author Ted Chiang explores his work's influence on
scientists and engineers, especially in the context of AI. Chiang's
focus stems from philosophical questions, often using speculative
scenarios to dramatize them, and he views science fiction as the ideal
medium for this exploration. He's skeptical about current AI
implementations, arguing that while impressive, they lack genuine
understanding and could be misused.
