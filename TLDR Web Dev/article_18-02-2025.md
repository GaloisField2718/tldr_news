ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT EXACTLY IS SCALABILITY? (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Scalability is a system's ability to handle increasing workloads by
adding resources, preventing slowdowns as it grows. Systems grow
through increased users, features, data, complexity, and/or geographic
locations. To make a system scalable, devs can use techniques like
vertical and horizontal scaling, load balancing, caching, and CDNs. 

 DEBUGGING AN UNDEBUGGABLE APP (24 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 An iOS app has sophisticated anti-debugging techniques, such as
preventing debugger attachment, causing phone reboots, and crashing
upon code injection. To tackle these problems, the developer first
identified the use of the ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH) function and then
showed two methods to bypass it: a simpler method involving
breakpoints, and a more involved approach analyzing the app's assembly
code to locate and skip the relevant system call. The phone reboot was
actually caused by an infinite loop continuously taking screen
snapshots, easily bypassed by using `thread return` in LLDB to skip
the offending function. Finally, the code injection crash is from the
app's reliance on an app group that gets removed during resigning,
which was fixed by avoiding resigning or using a jailbroken device.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DON'T CALL YOURSELF A SENIOR UNTIL YOU'VE WORKED ON A LEGACY PROJECT
(7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Working on a legacy project challenges your current knowledge and
provides important insights into why today's best practices are the
way they are. Seeing outdated practices in old codebases enforces the
value of current ones. 

 THE GENERATIVE AI CON (22 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Generative AI is full of hype and misleading marketing, despite
massive investment. Many of the products coming out of the industry
are often poorly executed and overly expensive. It's possible that the
current generative AI boom is a bubble. 

 10 TIPS FOR TURNING AROUND A PLATFORM TEAM (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Platform teams struggle when balancing roadmap progress with constant
ad hoc requests, leading to burnout and lost trust. To escape this
cycle, they must set strict constraints, track time spent, and deliver
small, tangible improvements consistently.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 VIMLM (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 VimLM is a Vim plugin with a LLM-powered coding assistant similar to
GitHub Copilot. It uses local MLX-compatible models, therefore working
completely offline. It provides contextual code understanding and
AI-assisted features through Vim keybindings, where users can interact
with the LLM via prompts (with context included). 

 SCIRA (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Scira is an AI-powered search engine that uses various APIs
(including Anthropic, Tavily, and several others) for web search, code
execution, map integration, and more. It's built with Next.js,
Tailwind CSS, and the Vercel AI SDK, and instructions for setting it
as a default search engine are provided.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SMALL TECH (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Small, independent software companies are viable alternatives to the
"grow or die" mentality of Silicon Valley. For example, SQLite,
Pinboard, Tarsnap, Sublime Text, and Zig are all examples of how small
teams, even solo developers, can build successful, sustainable
businesses. 

 HOW TO START A REACT PROJECT [2025] (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Vite is a fast and lightweight way to start a React project, while
Astro is better for content-focused websites. Next.js is a full-stack
framework with built-in features like SSR, RSC, and file-based
routing, which makes it well-rounded and powerful, but also more
complex. 

 LEARNING WEB EXTENSIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The core part of a web extension is its `manifest.json` file, which
helps define extension components like popups and content scripts.
Extensions can also have content scripts and background scripts to
interact with web pages and run tasks.

QUICK LINKS

 FRAMES OF MIND (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Frames of Mind allows you to visualize the "thought process" of a
language model (DeepSeek R1) by converting its chains of thought into
embeddings, plotting them using t-SNE, and analyzing the distances
between consecutive thoughts to identify phases like "search,"
"thinking," and "concluding." 

 USE THE INDEX, LUKE (WEBSITE) [15] 

 This is a free online guide to SQL performance optimization, focusing
on indexing for developers by explaining index structure, efficient
query writing, and common pitfalls. 

 NO, PRIVACY IS NOT DEAD: BEWARE THE ALL-OR-NOTHING MINDSET (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 A privacy advocate argues against the "privacy is dead" and
"all-or-nothing" mindsets, instead encouraging incremental
improvements in personal data privacy. 

 MY WASHING MACHINE REFRESHED MY THINKING ON SOFTWARE EFFORT
ESTIMATION (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 After installing a washing machine in a new house, which unexpectedly
took four hours instead of ten minutes due to unforeseen
complications, this dev found it similar to how difficult it is to
accurately estimate software development effort due to “unknown
unknowns.”
