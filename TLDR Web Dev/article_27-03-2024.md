 FASTEDGE: LOW-LATENCY EDGE COMPUTING FOR SERVERLESS APP DEPLOYMENT
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you‚Äôre running AI inference, A/B testing, authentication, or any
highly responsive app that relies on dynamically generated content,
you need low-latency edge computing.
Run code close to your users [4] on G-Core's global network with
FastEdge:

	* Low latency everywhere: Over 160 data centers. Average global
latency of just 30 ms [4].
	* Fast performance with WebAssembly on every edge server [4]:
FastEdge uses Wasm runtime to provide exceptional responsiveness.
	* Strong cloud ecosystem: Integrate your app with G-Core‚Äôs cloud
and network products including CDN, Virtual Machines, and S3 Storage.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DIVING INTO THE NODE.JS WEBSITE REDESIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Node.js recently revamped its website. This article explains the
story of how it was redesigned. The site has many converging use
cases, thousands of pages, and is a daily resource to many. Developers
iterated to create a revamped developer experience, clearer CI/CD
feedback, and an approachable tech stack. 

 HOW (AND WHY) TO RUN SQLITE IN PRODUCTION (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SQLite is a great database to use with Ruby on Rails apps for MVPs.
It simplifies deployment and configuration since it is just a single
executable and database file. SQLite is fast and scales quite well for
smaller applications. Configuration for the database and engine lives
within the Rails application itself, allowing for granular control and
experiences like branch-specific databases. 

 WHO KILLED THE NETWORK SWITCH? - A HUBRIS BUG STORY (19 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A seemingly unrelated code change in the Hubris operating system
caused a network switch to stop powering on. An investigation using a
debugger revealed a memory fault within a ‚Äúpower sequencer‚Äù task.
The root cause was a memory optimization feature that inadvertently
created multiple memory regions. This broke the kernel's memory
protection mechanism designed for single-region tasks.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TAILWIND HAS WON (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Fat Zebra settled on Tailwind CSS for its frontend development after
finding Bulma too lightweight and Bootstrap too heavy for its needs.
Tailwind offers a balance of features, great documentation, and a
preprocessor to optimize file size. 

 I‚ÄôM A DEVELOPER, NOT A COMPILER (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ‚ÄúNano-questions‚Äù about language syntax are poor indicators of
engineering ability and can even lead to false negatives during
interviews. Interviewers should focus on questions that assess a
candidate's design thinking and problem-solving skills. 

 SCRIPTS SHOULD BE WRITTEN USING THE PROJECT'S MAIN LANGUAGE (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Automation scripts should be written using the project‚Äôs main
language, as this improves maintainability, leverages existing
developer knowledge, and enhances cross-platform compatibility.
Ultimately, it reduces the number of abandoned scripts in the "script
graveyard."

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 PHIN (GITHUB REPO) [11]

upload CSV files, store them in tables, and perform SQL queries on the
uploaded data. 

 TRACECAT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Tracecat is an open-source security automation platform that provides
user-friendly, powerful, and accessible security automation for teams.
It combines enterprise-grade tools, open-source AI, and elements of
popular commercial SOAR platforms.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NODE.JS TSC CONFIRMS: NO INTENTION TO REMOVE NPM FROM DISTRIBUTION (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Node.js Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has clarified that
removing npm from the Node.js distribution is not a goal for the
project. Node.js will continue to ship with a package manager (npm)
for historical reasons and as the reference implementation for the npm
registry. 

 BUILDING AN EMAIL TO CALENDAR LLM (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This developer frequently overlooks actionable emails with
medium-level priorities, leading to missed tasks. They decided to
develop a tool that reads emails, extracts actionable items with the
help of an LLM, and adds those tasks directly to a calendar. They used
the open-source Mistral instruct model for the LLM piece of the
program and the Google API for accessing their email information.

 WHY DO REGEXES USE `$` AND `^` AS LINE ANCHORS? (2 MINUTE READ) [19]

influenced by the limited character set of the Teletype Model 35 input
device.
