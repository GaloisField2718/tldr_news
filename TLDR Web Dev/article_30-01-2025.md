 FAKE DATA? YOU CAN DO BETTER (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your application runs on real data, and that's what you should use to
build it. With advancements in AI-powered anonymization and synthetic
data, you can say goodbye to unreliable mock data — forever.

Neosync (3.7K GitHub stars) [4] creates production-like data that
developers can safely use locally:

 	* Integrates with your database or object storage
 	* Anonymizes sensitive data
 	* Generates representative synthetic data
 	* Syncs data across environments dev and test environments.

The result? You can now build and test locally [4] with safe, high
quality data — and no risk to security or privacy.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 A MAJOR POSTGRES UPGRADE WITH ZERO DOWNTIME (18 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Instant, a Firebase alternative, successfully performed a
zero-downtime major Postgres upgrade from version 13 to 16. Initial
attempts using in-place upgrades and blue-green deployments failed due
to downtime constraints and incompatibility with active replication
slots. Instant used a manual process that involved creating a new
Postgres 16 replica from scratch, carefully switching subscriptions,
and writing a custom zero-downtime algorithm, which paused new
transactions, waited for active ones to complete, and then switched
writes to the new instance. 

 UX++ AND DX++ WITH SYNC ENGINES (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Managing remote state in web web apps is complex. Current methods,
while improving developer workflow, create unnecessary loading states,
stale data issues, and complexities around optimistic UI updates. A
better solution is to use sync engines, such as Replicache, that
provide a local data copy, allowing for instant UI updates, offline
capability, and efficient data synchronization via a push/pull model
similar to Git.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY I STILL LIKE SUBLIME TEXT IN 2025 (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The author, a long-time Sublime Text user since 2010, explains why
they continue to prefer it in 2025. The main reasons include its speed
and efficiency, great support for Language Server Protocol (LSP)
features, and a powerful snippet system with scope-based
functionality. It also has good built-in project workspace management
that allows for customized settings, build systems, and file
exclusion. 

 NEXT.JS: AN HONEST REVIEW (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Next.js 14 is fast and developer-friendly, but the App Router
introduces complexity with use server, use client, and serialization
quirks. While Vercel makes deployment easy and offers great DX,
middleware limitations and accidental server code bundling can lead to
unexpected issues.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING REACT NATIVE AUDIO API (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The react-native-audio-api has been released. It brings Web Audio API
functionality to React Native, with precise audio control and
high-performance playback across iOS, Android, browsers, and desktop
applications. The tool implements a modular routing system where audio
flows from source nodes (like files or generators) through processing
nodes (for effects) to output nodes (speakers/hardware). 

 MATHESAR (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Mathesar is an open-source, self-hosted web application that provides
a spreadsheet-like interface for interacting with PostgreSQL
databases. It allows for viewing, editing, querying, and collaborative
work on data without needing to write code. 

 WHY DID YOU RENDER (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This is a React library that helps developers identify unnecessary
component re-renders by monkey-patching React to log potential
optimization opportunities. It supports React Native and offers
various configuration options for tracking components and hooks.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EFFECTIVE AI CODE SUGGESTIONS: LESS IS MORE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 An AI-powered code review tool initially attempted to prioritize code
suggestions by severity (bugs, style, etc.), but this led to an
overload of low-priority suggestions, drowning out important findings.
A shift to a "laser focus" approach, instructing the model to only
identify critical bugs and problems, improved results. This resulted
in a 50% increase in suggestion acceptance rates and an 11% increase
in overall impact. 

 WHY DEEPSEEK HAD TO BE OPEN-SOURCE (AND WHY IT WON'T DEFEAT OPENAI)
(5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 DeepSeek open-sourced its reasoning model R1, rivaling OpenAI's o1 in
performance but at a fraction of the cost due to innovative training
methods. This open-source approach, counterintuitive to standard
business practices, was necessary for DeepSeek to overcome Western
skepticism towards a Chinese AI company and gain market access. The
increasing commoditization of LLMs that have similar performance
across various models makes the higher cost of proprietary models like
OpenAI's less appealing. 

 ON DEEPSEEK AND EXPORT CONTROLS (18 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The advancements of the Chinese AI company DeepSeek, while
impressive, do not weaken the case for US export controls on chips to
China. There are three dynamics in AI development: scaling laws,
shifting the curve (cost reduction), and paradigm shifts in training
methods. DeepSeek's progress is largely consistent with expected cost
reductions and doesn't represent a fundamental breakthrough, but
rather shows that strong export controls remain crucial for
determining whether the future of AI will be unipolar (US-led) or
bipolar (US and China).

QUICK LINKS

 WIZ RESEARCH UNCOVERS EXPOSED DEEPSEEK DATABASE LEAKING SENSITIVE
INFORMATION, INCLUDING CHAT HISTORY (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Wiz Research discovered a publicly accessible DeepSeek database
containing over a million sensitive log entries, including chat
history and API keys. 

 SHOPIFY'S FORMER CTO SHARES INSIGHTS ON REACT NATIVE WITH
‘BOUNCIFY' GAME (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Shopify's adoption of React Native was a four-year journey that
involved extensive testing, internal projects, strategic acquisitions,
and overcoming technical concerns. 

 KEYMAPPER (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Keymapper is a cross-platform, context-aware key remapper that allows
users to redefine keyboard layouts and shortcuts, manage shortcuts in
a single configuration file, and share configurations across different
operating systems.
