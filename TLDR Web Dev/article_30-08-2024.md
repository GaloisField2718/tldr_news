 WHEN REGEX GOES WRONG (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In 2016, Stack Overflow suffered a 34-minute outage due to a regex
that caused catastrophic backtracking when processing a malformed
input string. In 2019, Cloudflare experienced a global outage due to a
regex that led to CPU exhaustion. More recently, CrowdStrike faced a
kernel issue caused by a regex mismatch. 

 BYPASSING AIRPORT SECURITY VIA SQL INJECTION (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The authors of this article discovered a critical vulnerability in
FlyCASS, a system used by smaller airlines to participate in the TSA's
Known Crewmember (KCM) and Cockpit Access Security System (CASS)
programs. They exploited a SQL injection flaw to gain administrative
access to FlyCASS, allowing them to add unauthorized individuals to
the KCM and CASS programs, bypass security screening, and gain access
to cockpits. 

 THE SECRET INSIDE ONE MILLION CHECKBOXES (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 One Million Checkboxes was a website where users could check or
uncheck boxes, with their actions affecting everyone. When the site
became popular, a group of teenagers discovered a way to leave secret
messages in the website's data by manipulating the checkboxes to form
binary codes that spelled out URLs and even a QR code.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 COGNITIVE LOAD IS WHAT MATTERS (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cognitive load is the mental effort required to understand code. High
cognitive load leads to confusion, which wastes time and money. Code
can be written to minimize cognitive load, such as through using clear
variable names, avoiding deep inheritance hierarchies, and favoring
deep modules over shallow ones. 

 IS IT BETTER TO BE A JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES OR A MASTER-OF-ONE? (REDDIT
THREAD) [8] 

 A Redditor asks if it's better to be a generalist or a specialist.
The consensus is that it's best to be a ‚ÄúT-shaped‚Äù engineer, where
you have general knowledge of a variety of subjects, but are
specialized in a certain area. In general, developers should try to be
as knowledgeable as possible while also trying to be the ‚Äúexpert‚Äù
in certain areas on their team.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MATERIAL UI V6 IS OUT NOW (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Material UI v6 is out now. Some of the new features include CSS theme
variables, color schemes, and container queries. CSS theme variables
allow you to access variables from the theme.vars object with the same
structure as the theme.

 Onlook enables developers to build their React + TailwindCSS apps
visually in the browser. It's an open-source, local-first visual
editor that lets you make live edits directly in the browser DOM.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPENAI IS SHOCKINGLY GOOD AT UNMINIFYING CODE (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ChatGPT successfully deobfuscated a complex React application that
generates ASCII art based on character sets, time, and window size. At
first, the developer believed ChatGPT's implementation was inaccurate
but later discovered it was due to a copy-paste error in the input
code, leading to incorrect character encoding. After correcting the
input, ChatGPT's output matched the original component perfectly. 

 THE BALKANIZED INTERNET: THE ROLE OF LARGE CLOUD PROVIDERS (11 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 The "balkanized internet" is caused by the dominance of large cloud
providers. This trend contrasts with the internet's early days, when
public access was strictly non-commercial and operated on a shared
infrastructure. Today, cloud providers control significant portions of
internet infrastructure, leading to a situation where users are
increasingly confined within their respective cloud environments. 

 THE TOP PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 2024 (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Python continues to lead IEEE Spectrum's 2024 programming language
rankings, driven by its dominance in AI and education, while SQL
remains highly sought after by employers. Rising stars include
TypeScript and Rust, with the latter gaining attention for its memory
safety features.
