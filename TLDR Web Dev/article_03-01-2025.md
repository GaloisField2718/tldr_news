ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SCALING FROM A BILLION TO A MILLION TO ONE (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Initially, this developer built an LLM monitoring tool using scalable
technologies like Next.js, Vercel, and PlanetScale. However, the need
for compliance and on-premise deployments forced a shift to AWS,
requiring a simplification of the architecture and a reduction in
resource demands. Ultimately, the need for a single-user, easily
installable version led to further scaling down. 

 OPTIMIZING RUBY'S JSON, PART 4 (17 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The author, a recent maintainer of Ruby's `json` gem, made it the
fastest JSON parser and generator in many benchmarks. These
improvements weren't complex; they involved straightforward
optimizations identified through profiling, showing that simple
changes can yield substantial speed gains. The motivation stemmed from
the widespread, albeit problematic, use of the
faster-but-less-reliable `oj` gem, which caused compatibility issues
and crashes due to its aggressive monkey patching and less robust
coding practices.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FUTURE-PROOFING YOUR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CAREER (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 LLMs help automate routine tasks, but these tools still require human
oversight for complex system design, debugging, and understanding
business needs. Engineers can future-proof their careers by focusing
on areas where AI struggles, such as system architecture, domain
expertise, and translating user needs into scalable solutions. Great
engineers use LLMs to help them move faster and work more efficiently.


 HOW I USE CLAUDE (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Claude 3.6 led to this author using Claude for tasks like coding,
advice, exploration, and writing. He breaks down his exact usage for
each. For example, for code, Claude writes something for him 50% of
the time and acts as a rubber ducky to throw ideas off of the other
50% of the time. 

 I AM RICH AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE (9 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 After selling his company for $60 million, the author (Loom's
co-founder) found himself adrift, lacking purpose despite his wealth
and freedom. He pursued various ventures, including exploring robotics
and climbing a Himalayan peak. Currently in Hawaii studying physics,
he's embracing a more humble approach, focusing on self-discovery and
accepting ambiguity. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BENCHJS (WEBSITE) [9] 

 BenchJS is a browser-based JavaScript benchmarking tool that allows
users to write, run, compare, and share benchmarks using TypeScript or
JavaScript, providing real-time metrics and collaborative features. 

 NITRO (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Nitro is a cross-platform framework for building native modules in
React Native using C++, Swift, or Kotlin. It provides statically
compiled bindings for improved performance and type safety and is
highly performant compared to alternatives. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 REACT + AI STACK FOR 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The React + AI development stack for 2025 includes Next.js as a
meta-framework, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Zustand for client-state
management. Useful AI-powered tools include Visual Copilot, an
AI-driven Figma plugin that converts designs into React code, and
Cursor, an AI code editor. Bolt, a browser-based platform for building
React apps from text descriptions, is also useful. 

 RULES FOR WRITING SOFTWARE TUTORIALS (28 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Effective software tutorials have clear titles and introductions that
explain the tutorial's goal and demonstrate the end result. Other
recommendations include making code copy-pasteable, using long
command-line flags, separating user-defined values from reusable
logic, and keeping the code in a working state throughout the
tutorial. 

 GENERATIVE AI IS NOT GOING TO BUILD YOUR ENGINEERING TEAM FOR YOU (28
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Generative AI will not replace junior software engineers. While AI
can generate code quickly, it cannot produce reliable, maintainable
code, and the real challenge lies in managing complex software
systems. Hiring junior engineers is an investment in the future.
