 TAILWIND CSS HAS A SCALABILITY PROBLEM. HOW CAN WE SOLVE THAT? (9
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tailwind CSS is known for its focus on class-based design, but the
emphasis on classes can pose scalability challenges. These scalability
issues arise from complex, dynamically generated class strings for
components and conflicting styles due to the unpredictable order of
class insertion. There are two solutions for addressing these
problems: Class Variance Authority (CVA) and tailwind-merge. CVA
introduces a Variants API for Tailwind, allowing developers to define
variants and compound variants, which are activated based on specific
prop combinations. Tailwind-merge resolves class conflicts by merging
class sets and removing duplicates, ensuring that custom class
overrides work as intended.

time it takes to restore service. This article challenges the efficacy
of measuring productivity using DORA metrics and outlines some of the
bottlenecks it presents, such as measuring velocity properly. It also
offers tips that will help you successfully work on a team that relies
