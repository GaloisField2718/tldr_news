 MEDIOCRE ENGINEER'S GUIDE TO HTTPS (13 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The internet operates as a network of interconnected computer
networks with a layered structure, where each layer provides specific
functionalities. HTTP requests travel through these layers, starting
with the sender's request and ending with content rendering on the
client's screen. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses TLS for
encryption and verification, where the TLS handshake process
establishes a secure connection and generates session keys for
encrypted communication between client and server. 

 HOW PYTHON COMPARES FLOATS AND INTS (19 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Python's comparison of floating-point and integer numbers can lead to
unexpected results due to the lack of implicit type promotion and the
use of infinite precision integers. CPython, a reference
implementation of Python, uses a complex algorithm to compare floats
and ints, which involves comparing signs, magnitudes, exponents, and
actual values. That's why it's recommended to use library functions
for comparing floating-point values to avoid unexpected results. 

 ABUSING GO'S INFRASTRUCTURE (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Arbitrary data, including non-Go code, can be uploaded to Go's
checksum database and proxy. This is possible because the checksum
database automatically fetches and stores module data if it's not
already present. This mechanism can be exploited for malicious
purposes, such as bypassing download restrictions, storing malware
payloads, or implementing command and control (C2) channels.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 RANT: I'M REALLY STARTING TO DESPISE THE INTERNET THESE DAYS, AS A
WEB DEVELOPER (REDDIT THREAD) [7] 

 This author dislikes the current state of the internet due to
paywalls on useful articles, outdated StackOverflow answers, automatic
pop-ups for login and modals, and cookie consent banners. The constant
need to close popups and banners on websites is annoying. 

 THE DESKILLING OF WEB DEV IS HARMING THE PRODUCT BUT, MORE
IMPORTANTLY, IT'S DAMAGING OUR HEALTH ‚Äì THIS IS WHY BURNOUT HAPPENS
(10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Web devs are experiencing high levels of burnout and churn due to the
unrealistic expectation for developers to be experts in multiple
specialized fields. Developers are having a hard time keeping up with
the pace of change in each area of expertise. Companies are deskilling
the industry by pushing for the use of tools like AI to replace
skilled developers, leading to lower wages, job insecurity, and worse
software. 

 WRITE CODE THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU GET PAGED AT 2AM (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Clever code is difficult to understand. ‚ÄúClever code‚Äù can stem
from valuing complex code over readability, premature abstraction, or
over-adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Devs
should instead try to write simple code that their future selves can
easily understand.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WARP: A REIMAGINED RUST-BASED TERMINAL WITH AI BUILT-IN (SPONSOR)
[10] 

 Great software starts on the command line. Warp makes it faster and
easier to write commands with IDE-style editing [10], and smart
completions. You can even ask AI to help you out [10] when you're
looking for the right command or stuck on a programming problem. No
Googling required! Download on Mac or Linux [10] 

 DATAHERALD (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Dataherald is a natural language-to-SQL engine built for question
answering over relational data. It allows you to set up an API from
your database that can answer questions in plain English. 

 LO (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 LO is a simple programming language that targets WASM. It's easy to
use and modify and it has very few dependencies.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CLOUDFLARE TOOK DOWN OUR WEBSITE AFTER TRYING TO FORCE US TO PAY
120K$ WITHIN 24H (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This author's company was using Cloudflare's Business plan for years
when it was suddenly asked to upgrade to Enterprise at a much higher
cost within 24 hours or face website takedown. Despite negotiations,
Cloudflare purged all of its domains, which caused it significant
downtime and loss of customer trust. 

 TO THE BRAIN, READING COMPUTER CODE IS NOT THE SAME AS READING
LANGUAGE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 MIT neuroscientists discovered that reading computer code activates
the multiple demand network in the brain, a region responsible for
complex cognitive tasks, rather than the language-processing areas.
This means that understanding code is a distinct cognitive process
different from both language and math. Experienced programmers don't
rely on language regions for coding tasks.
