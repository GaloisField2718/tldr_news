 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HANDLING UNIQUE INDEXES ON LARGE DATA IN POSTGRESQL (9 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 A production deployment failed due to a PostgreSQL limitation on
unique index size for large text fields. This limitation is because
PostgreSQL stores data in 8KB pages and enforces a maximum index entry
size of roughly 2.7KB (1/3 of a page) within B-Tree indexes to
optimize performance and page splitting. The solution involves
creating a new column to store a hash of the large text field,
implementing a trigger to automatically generate the hash on insert or
update, and then creating a unique index on this hash column. 

 UNCOMMON USES OF PYTHON IN COMMONLY USED LIBRARIES (10 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Common Python libraries often use Python in uncommon ways. `super()`
in Python base classes is often used for cooperative multiple
inheritance, and mixins are strategically applied for modularizing
optional features. Relative imports are used for correct package
resolution, and the `__init__.py` file doesn't always have the same
purpose across packages.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHEN FIGMA STARTS DESIGNING US (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Figma is subtly pushing designers towards an engineering-centric
approach through features like Auto Layout and Dev Mode. These
features encourage premature optimization and a narrowing of the
design space by prioritizing structure and consistency over
exploration and spontaneity. This trend can lead to a monoculture in
design, where everything feels similar due to shared constraints
imposed by the tool. 

 A NON-ANTHROPOMORPHIZED VIEW OF LLMS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Anthropomorphizing LLMs with concepts like consciousness or ethics is
misleading because they are essentially complex mathematical functions
generating text. The real challenge lies in quantifying and bounding
the probability of LLMs generating undesirable sequences, a task that
is difficult because of our inability to define what exactly
"undesirable" is. Focusing on LLMs as powerful sequence generators,
rather than attributing human-like qualities to them, is necessary for
clearer thinking about their impact and potential risks.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ADD SERVER-SIDE SUPPORT FOR MCP IN NEXT.JS (SPONSOR) [13] 

 Clerk now supports server-side MCP in Next.js with a single API
route—no extra services needed. Scorecard cut their MCP code from
1,000 lines to just 70. It's the fastest way to ship multi-tenant
logic with Clerk. Read the changelog [14]. 

 MORPH (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Morph is a fast AI code edit application with models like
morph-v3-fast. It is capable of applying edits at 4,500+ tokens/sec by
referencing existing code and offers an alternative to slow, full-file
rewrites. 

 BNA UI (WEBSITE) [16] 

 BNA UI provides Expo React Native UI components designed for both iOS
and Android. The library includes components, charts, hooks, and
themes. 

 ZERO (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Zero is an open-source AI email solution focused on data privacy and
self-hosting. It allows users to integrate multiple email providers
like Gmail while improving email functionality with AI agents.

 ADDING A FEATURE BECAUSE CHATGPT INCORRECTLY THINKS IT EXISTS (3
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This dev noticed an influx of ChatGPT screenshots containing ASCII
tablature being uploaded to Soundslice, his sheet music scanning
service. He discovered that ChatGPT was falsely advertising that
Soundslice supported ASCII tablature import, leading users to believe
the feature existed. Faced with this unexpected "market demand" driven
by AI misinformation, his team decided to actually build an ASCII tab
importer. 

 I USED O3 TO PROFILE MYSELF FROM MY SAVED POCKET LINKS (7 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 This dev profiled themselves using their saved Pocket articles before
the service shut down. They used OpenAI's o3 model to analyze their
saved URLs. o3 accurately predicted the author's age, location, family
size, career, and other details based on the content they had saved. 

 THE ERA OF EXPLORATION (16 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Future AI progress will depend more on exploration, acquiring new and
informative experiences, rather than just scaling parameters.
Pretraining LLMs inadvertently pays an "exploration tax" by learning a
rich sampling distribution, allowing smaller models to later distill
reasoning abilities. Exploration has two key axes: "world sampling,"
deciding which problems to learn from, and "path sampling,"
determining how to gather data within those problems.

QUICK LINKS

 THE FIRST TIME I WAS ALMOST FIRED FROM APPLE (15 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 A newly hired Apple engineer almost got fired for including
copyrighted T.S. Eliot poetry in the Color Picker's code as an Easter
egg, a mistake that taught him a valuable lesson about intellectual
property. 

 CURSOR'S STEALTH BAIT AND SWITCH: FROM UNLIMITED TO UNUSABLE - MY
STORY (5 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 A Cursor user writes about a frustrating experience of constant,
unannounced downgrades and limitations to their "unlimited" AI coding
tool subscription, which ended up being a bait-and-switch scenario. 

 'I'M BEING PAID TO FIX ISSUES CAUSED BY AI' (6 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Businesses are hiring professionals to fix problems and rewrite
generic, faulty content and code generated by AI tools like ChatGPT,
often due to unrealistic expectations and a lack of understanding of
AI's limitations.
