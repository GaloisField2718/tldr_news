 TURN FIGMA DESIGNS INTO PRODUCTION CODE THAT ACTUALLY FOLLOWS YOUR
DESIGN SYSTEM (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most AI tools generate code that ignores your components and design
tokens. Engineers end up spending more time refactoring than shipping.

Fusion closes that gap. It connects to GitHub, understands your
components and patterns, and turns Figma designs into production-ready
code that matches your system.

WHY TEAMS SHIP FASTER WITH FUSION:

	* Engineers start with 80% of the UI in place and spend their time on
real logic
	* Designers move from Figma to code without losing fidelity
	* PMs turn prototypes into production ready code
	* Design systems stay enforced automatically across every build

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FROM 8 YEARS DOWN TO 6 MONTHS: HOW WE BUILT AI TO SPLIT THE
MONDAY.COM MONOLITH (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Monday.com successfully used an AI-powered migration system called
"Morphex" to break apart its massive JavaScript client monolith in
just 6 months, reducing the original estimate of 8 person-years of
manual work. Morphex combines AI with deterministic code
orchestration, breaking the complex migration into small, validated
steps while using Monday.com's own platform to track progress and
manage thousands of files across the codebase. The hybrid approach has
strict validation at each step, human oversight through "Human Todos"
and code reviews, and parallel processing to migrate from JavaScript
to TypeScript. 

 THE “MOST HATED” CSS FEATURE: COS() AND SIN() (18 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 CSS trigonometric functions, specifically `cos()` and `sin()`, were
identified as the "Most Hated Feature" in the State of CSS 2025
survey. This article explains these functions by relating them to the
unit circle and Cartesian coordinates, explaining how they can be used
to calculate positions in circular and wavy layouts. The article then
shows how `cos()` and `sin()` can be used to create damped oscillatory
animations. 

 LOW- AND MID-TIER MOBILE FOR THE REAL WORLD (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 It can be good to use real-world low- and mid-tier mobile devices for
web performance testing in 2025, rather than relying solely on Chrome
DevTools' emulated settings. This dev recommends the Samsung Galaxy
A15 5G ($199) for low-tier testing and the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G
($450) for mid-tier testing, based on their global market penetration,
representative hardware capabilities, long software support, and
reasonable pricing.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHEN THE JOB SEARCH BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE: THREE PHASES OF BURNOUT (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 During a prolonged job search, this dev burned out. As time goes on,
there is an increasing exhaustion and desperation in each phase as
traditional job-seeking methods fail. However, devs in this situation
aren't alone, and should take rest and recharge their minds when they
burn out during such tough job searches. 

 IN DEFENSE OF C++ (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This dev defends C++ against common criticisms, saying that its
complexity is manageable, its age doesn't equate to obsolescence, and
its "unsafe" reputation can be mitigated. C++'s large ecosystem and
continuous updates, like C++20 and C++23, make it a relevant choice
for various applications. 

 LET'S KILL VIBE CODING AND BRING BACK PROMPT ENGINEERING (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Devs have abandoned the methodical approach of prompt engineering in
favor of vibe coding. While vibe coding may feel effortless, it often
produces sloppy, inconsistent results, whereas prompt engineering
leads to higher-quality, more reliable AI-generated code through
deliberate problem-breaking and iteration.

 CLAUDE CODE ACTION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Claude Code Action is a GitHub Action developed by Anthropic that
allows Claude to answer questions, implement code changes, review
code, and automate tasks within pull requests and issues. It detects
when to activate based on mentions, assignments, or prompts, and
supports multiple authentication methods. 

 CLAUDE FLOW (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Claude-Flow is an enterprise-grade AI orchestration platform. It
combines hive-mind swarm intelligence, neural pattern recognition, and
many MCP tools to help create AI-powered development workflows. The
platform has a dynamic agent architecture, SQLite memory system,
advanced hooks, and GitHub integration. 

 ANNOUNCING GENKIT GO 1.0 AND ENHANCED AI-ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT (8
MINUTE READ) [14]

 ANTHROPIC ECONOMIC INDEX REPORT: UNEVEN GEOGRAPHIC AND ENTERPRISE AI
ADOPTION (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic's Economic Index report shows that AI adoption is following
historical patterns of technological diffusion, with usage
concentrated in wealthy regions and specific enterprise applications,
though at an unprecedented speed. The report found that 40% of US
employees now use AI at work (up from 20% in 2023), with high-income
countries like Singapore and Canada showing 4.6x and 2.9x expected
usage rates, respectively, while emerging economies like India and
Nigeria lag significantly behind. Enterprise API usage shows
businesses primarily deploying AI for automation tasks (77% of cases).


 HOW RUBY EXECUTES JIT CODE: THE HIDDEN MECHANICS BEHIND THE MAGIC (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article explains the inner workings of Ruby's JIT (Just-In-Time)
compilers. JIT-compiled machine code lives alongside the original
bytecode in Ruby's Instruction Sequences (ISEQs), with Ruby deciding
which to execute based on call frequency. Methods must be called 25+
times to be profiled and 30+ times to be compiled to native code. When
JIT code's assumptions are violated, Ruby "de-optimizes" by falling
back to the interpreter to guarantee correctness.
