ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BEYOND REACT.MEMO: SMARTER WAYS TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE (6 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Many React performance issues are from unnecessary re-renders caused
by state changes propagating through the component tree. Instead of
relying on React.memo, optimize component structure by moving state
down and using composition patterns to prevent excessive re-renders.
This requires devs to truly understand React's rendering model and use
the `children` prop to pass components, as it prevents unnecessary
re-renders because React compares element references. 

 A SOFTWARE ENGINEER'S GUIDE TO READING RESEARCH PAPERS (11 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A good way to properly read research papers is by using a multi-pass
strategy. First, get the big picture by focusing on the Abstract,
Introduction, Results, and Conclusion. Second, go deeper into the
remaining sections, noting unfamiliar terms and references. Lastly,
conduct background research and revisit the paper to connect the dots.


 HTTP/3 IS EVERYWHERE BUT NOWHERE (17 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Despite standardization and browser support, HTTP/3 adoption is
uneven, which creates a divide between hyperscale and long-tail web
users. Hyperscale companies are implementing HTTP/3 and QUIC (Quick
UDP Internet Connections) for performance gains, while standard
libraries and open-source tools lack support. This fragmentation is
partly due to OpenSSL's incompatible QUIC API.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY "NORMAL" ENGINEERS ARE THE KEY TO GREAT TEAMS (10 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Focusing on individual brilliance, such as on mythical "10x
engineers," distracts from building effective systems that allow
"normal" engineers to contribute meaningfully. A great engineering
organization empowers average engineers to consistently deliver value,
make progress for the business, and eventually be world-class talent. 

 AS AN ENGINEER, I'D RATHER BE CALLED STUPID THAN STAY SILENT (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Embracing vulnerability and asking "stupid" questions is necessary
for growth in an engineering career. Staying silent out of fear can
lead to miscommunication, delays, and suboptimal work, negatively
impacting both individual performance and team efficiency.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW WELL CAN YOU SPOT & FIX VULNERABILITIES? (SPONSOR) [9] 

 → Take the Secure Coding Knowledge Assessment [10] (based on the
OWASP Top 10 and CWE Top 25) to see how your expertise stacks up.

→ Read about how secure code training unlocks developer potential on
the Security Journey blog [11]

 GOOGLE IS GIVING AWAY GEMINI'S BEST PAID FEATURES FOR FREE — HERE'S
THE TOOLS YOU CAN TRY NOW (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google is offering several new Gemini features for free, including
personalized responses based on users' Google Search history. Deep
Research, an AI research assistant that generates detailed reports, is
also now free. Gemini can now connect with Google apps like Calendar,
Notes, and Tasks, allowing for complex multi-app requests. It is
expanding to Google Photos soon. Custom AI assistants called Gems are
being rolled out for free. 

 AVID (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Avid is an AI-powered platform that allows users to quickly and
easily create mobile apps in Flutter with prompting. 

 CARBON (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The Carbon Design System is an open-source design system by IBM. This
repository has working code, design tools, resources, and guidelines
for building UIs.

 HOW ENGINEERING TEAMS ARE USING AI (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Current AI tools are optimized for greenfield development and
single-player workflows, which don't translate well to complex
codebases and team environments. Instead, teams use AI as
"augmentation" tools that help human developers develop faster rather
than replacing them. AI helps reduce toil in areas like testing and
documentation. 

 IO DEVICES AND LATENCY (25 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Non-volatile storage has evolved from tape drives to hard disk drives
(HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). While tape storage is
cost-effective for large-scale archiving, HDDs and SSDs provide faster
access speeds, with SSDs eliminating mechanical components for lower
latency. Cloud computing introduced network-attached storage, which is
scalable, but introduces latency and IOPS limitations compared to
directly attached storage. PlanetScale Metal is a hybrid, using
directly-attached NVMe SSDs in a replicated Vitess+MySQL cluster to
overcome the shortcomings of network-attached storage. 

 EVERYONE IN AI IS TALKING ABOUT MANUS. WE PUT IT TO THE TEST (7
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Manus is a general AI agent developed by Butterfly Effect that is
gaining attention for its ability to autonomously tackle complex tasks
by combining multiple AI models and agents. While still imperfect,
it's great for tasks like research and analysis. It gives users a
collaborative, transparent experience with the ability to intervene in
its process.

 I'M TEACHING DATABASES THIS SEMESTER AT BERKELEY (2 MINUTE READ) [18]


 A UC Berkeley lecturer suspects students are excessively using
ChatGPT for coding assignments, leading to a lack of debugging skills,
lower exam scores, and ultimately jeopardizing their future careers by
hurting their ability to handle complex, real-world problems that AI
cannot solve. 

 OPENAI ASKS WHITE HOUSE FOR RELIEF FROM STATE AI RULES (3 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 OpenAI is urging the Trump administration to offer AI companies
relief from state regulations in exchange for voluntarily sharing
their AI models with the federal government. 

 WHY YOUR ‘HARMONIOUS' TEAM IS ACTUALLY FAILING (3 MINUTE READ) [20]


 Teams that prioritize harmony over honest communication often fail
because they avoid the productive conflict necessary for critical
thinking and improvement. 

 HOW THE NEW YORK TIMES SYSTEMATICALLY MIGRATED FROM ENZYME INTO REACT
TESTING LIBRARY (7 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 The New York Times migrated from Enzyme to React Testing Library
using a piecemeal approach, starting with simple files and building
momentum over time.
