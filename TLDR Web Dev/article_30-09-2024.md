 EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PYTHON 3.13 ‚Äì JIT AND GIL WENT UP
THE HILL (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Python 3.13 (officially releasing on October 1) introduces two major
changes: a "free-threaded" version that allows disabling the Global
Interpreter Lock (GIL), potentially boosting multi-threaded
performance, and experimental Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation, which
could improve performance over time. The GIL removal addresses
Python's limitations in fully utilizing multi-core processors, while
the JIT compiler promises to optimize code execution by generating
machine code on the fly. 

 A TAXONOMY OF TECH DEBT (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An engineering manager at Riot Games proposes a taxonomy for
categorizing tech debt based on three metrics: impact, fix cost, and
contagion. The impact measures the negative effects of the debt, fix
cost assesses the resources needed to rectify it, and contagion
quantifies its potential spread. He identifies four types of tech
debt: local debt, MacGyver debt, foundational debt, and data debt,
each with unique characteristics and strategies for mitigation. 

 BUILD A SERVERLESS ACID DATABASE WITH THIS ONE NEAT TRICK (ATOMIC
PUTIFABSENT) (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post goes through implementing a serverless ACID database
using 500 lines of Go code with no external dependencies. It uses
atomic ‚ÄúPutIfAbsent‚Äù operations on a file system-based object
store to achieve concurrency control and snapshot isolation. Working
code examples are shown throughout the post.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TYPES VS NO TYPES (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Using types in programming is similar to color-coding wires in an
electrical system. Types act as labels, making it easier to understand
the flow of data in code and preventing mismatches. They also provide
automatic error checking and make it simpler to identify and fix
issues, so they should always be used in complex codebases. 

 I AM TIRED OF AI (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This software testing expert is frustrated with the overhyped and
often ineffective use of AI in various domains. He feels that AI's
current applications often lack depth and fail to replace human
creativity and critical thinking. He especially dislikes the mindless
adoption of AI without considering its real value and impact. 

 IT'S HARD TO WRITE CODE FOR COMPUTERS, BUT IT'S EVEN HARDER TO WRITE
CODE FOR HUMANS (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Writing code for humans is much harder than writing code for
computers because it involves understanding and catering to a user's
mental model of the code. To do this well, devs should prioritize user
onboarding, provide clear examples rather than abstract concepts, and
create a user-friendly experience by minimizing conceptual overload.

 IF YOUR AI SEEMS SMARTER, IT'S THANKS TO SMARTER HUMAN TRAINERS (6
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI models are getting better thanks to human trainers who verify the
accuracy and reliability of AI outputs. They teach models to avoid
errors and hallucinations, while also providing high-quality data that
makes the models' outputs better overall. 

 HOW ALPHACHIP TRANSFORMED COMPUTER CHIP DESIGN (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AlphaChip is a reinforcement learning method developed by Google that
uses AI to create chip layouts in hours, a process that previously
took weeks or months. It was created initially for Google's Tensor
Processing Units (TPUs) and generates layouts that outperform human
design. These layouts are used in chips worldwide. 

 VISUAL STUDIO CODE IS DESIGNED TO FRACTURE (21 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 While VSCode's source code is open, Microsoft uses a proprietary
license for the downloadable product and strategically incorporates
telemetry and other features that fracture the open-source community.
This strategy creates legal barriers for companies like Gitpod,
GitLab, and others who attempt to build competing products based on
VSCode.
