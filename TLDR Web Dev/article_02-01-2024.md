ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 GIT REBASE: WHAT CAN GO WRONG? (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 It‚Äôs common for developers to face issues when using Git's "rebase"
feature. Common issues include repeated conflict resolution,
difficulty when rebasing many commits, the complexity of undoing a
rebase, issues with force pushing to shared branches, complications in
code reviews due to force pushes, and loss of commit metadata. To help
solve this, the article describes varying levels of "commit
discipline,‚Äù alternative workflows like the "squash and merge"
approach, and the author‚Äôs personal rules for using rebase
effectively. 

 HOW PINTEREST SCALED TO 11 MILLION USERS WITH ONLY 6 ENGINEERS (6
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Pinterest scaled rapidly from a small startup with just 1 engineer to
handling 11 million monthly active users with only 6 engineers. The
key takeaways from its scaling journey include the importance of using
known, proven technologies, keeping the architecture simple, avoiding
overcomplication, favoring sharding databases over clustering, and
embracing limited, proven choices. Pinterest went through various
phases of growth, optimizing its tech stack along the way, and learned
valuable lessons about database structuring and management, such as
how to pick proper database primary keys when sharding. 

 COMMITTING WITHOUT GIT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article discusses how to create Git commits using Python and
without using the Git command-line interface. It explains the process
step by step, covering the creation of blobs, trees, commits, and
branches manually. Python code snippets are provided for each step
along with explanations of Git's underlying data structures.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 2024 GUIDE TO GOALS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Setting clear goals provides focus, helps in decision-making, and
reduces the ambiguity in one's path. This article covers different
types of goals, including those partially within one's control,
completely within one's control, action-based checklists, recurring
patterns, and feeling-based goals. To decide on goals, it‚Äôs helpful
to start with focus areas and define the "why" behind each goal. 

 HOW PROMOTIONS AND RATINGS WORK (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Self-reviews, peer reviews, manager reviews, and performance
discussions are all used for determining an employee's rating in big
tech companies. To understand promotions and ratings well, it‚Äôs
important to know that managers don't have full control over ratings
and that it‚Äôs important to have higher-up engineers and managers
vouching for you. 

 HOW TO PREPARE THE SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEW (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 It‚Äôs important to identify common patterns in real-world
applications, recognize knowledge gaps, and collect resources for
study and practice when preparing for system design interviews,
particularly for FAANG companies. The framework for succeeding during
interviews involves asking clarifying questions, proposing high-level
designs, diving into details, and addressing follow-up questions.
Various resources for study, practice, and learning are provided in
the article.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HACKER STARTUP (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Hacker Startup is a list of starter kits and templates for developers
to build their next project faster. It includes kits and templates for
Next.js, Nuxt, Ruby on Rails, Django, and more. 

 PAGE REPLICA (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Page Replica is a web scraping and caching tool created using
Node.js, Express, and Puppeteer. It is designed to prerender web
application pages (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) for SEO or other uses.
It can scrape single web pages or entire sitemaps with an API,
optionally removing JavaScript and caching the HTML. The tool also
includes an Nginx configuration for efficiently handling both user and
search engine bot traffic. 

 DBCHAOS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 DBChaos allows developers to stress-test their databases with
pre-defined queries. It validates slow and expensive queries that may
break a database.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW I DESTROYED THE COMPANY'S DB (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The author of this article received a support team message about a
customer problem, leading to the accidental deletion of all orders in
the production database due to a flawed SQL query. The recovery
process involved downtime and efforts to restore the database to a
previous state. The mistakes made include working on production during
the weekend without proper testing, manual database editing, and not
using transactions. 

 THE HARDEST PART OF BUILDING SOFTWARE IS NOT CODING, IT'S
REQUIREMENTS (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Coding itself is relatively straightforward - the real challenge lies
in defining clear and accurate software requirements. This will make
it difficult for AI to replace software engineers. AI cannot create
software requirements well, but can assist in rewriting existing
software based on well-defined specifications. 

 MUSINGS ON THE C CHARTER (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 There are various principles that should guide the update of the C
committee‚Äôs charter for the long-term health of C. These include the
importance of providing a simple upgrade path between adjacent
versions of C while allowing for incompatibilities, minimizing
incompatibilities with C++, maintaining conceptual simplicity, and
addressing memory safety issues that plague C.

QUICK LINKS

 BUN, JAVASCRIPT, AND TCO (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Tail Call Optimization (TCO) in JavaScriptCore, the engine behind
Bun, allows for optimized recursive functions. This allows Bun to be
faster than other JavaScript runtimes. 

 SUBJECT FIRST COMMIT MESSAGES (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 "Subject-First Commit Messages" are easier to scan and read. The more
common style of commit messages has an active voice and imperative
mood style, which is harder to read. 

 GIT THINGS (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This article suggests strategies for managing commits within feature
branches, file moves, and color-coded line changes in diffs. It also
advises making changes smaller and more frequent, optimizing CI
processes, and reevaluating the traditional code review process.
