ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 RESILIENT SYNC FOR LOCAL FIRST (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Local-first software stores and processes data locally on users'
devices while using the internet for backup when connected. Resilient
Sync uses a simple log format to track changes and assets, allowing
offline data processing and easy sync across devices. It offers
independence from push notifications, the ability to load entries
without knowing their content, easy detection of missing data, and the
option for data replication and peer-to-peer synchronization. 

 MOBX MEMOIZES COMPONENTS (YOU DON'T NEED REACT COMPILER) (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 MobX, a React state management library, automatically tracks
dependencies and memoizes components. The upcoming React Compiler is
meant to auto-memoize components, but MobX already does this more
efficiently with less memory. 

 CATCHING COMPROMISED COOKIES (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Slack detects session forking through the use of last access
timestamps, IP addresses, and a two-phased cookie update approach.
Session forking is when a cookie is being used from more than one
device at the same time. Slack's system helps identify and mitigate
the risks associated with stolen cookies while reducing false
positives and minimizing performance impact.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MICROFEATURES I LOVE IN BLOGS AND PERSONAL WEBSITES (15 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Microfeatures, like sidenotes, tables of contents, and easily
linkable headings, enhance the quality of life for readers of blogs
and personal websites. Little UX details on a website can have huge
ROIs on user experience. 

 THE DEATH OF THE JUNIOR DEVELOPER (21 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 There may be a potential decrease in demand for junior developers due
to the rise of AI-powered coding assistants like ChatGPT. Junior
developers should focus on learning fundamentals like algorithms, data
structures, and system design, rather than just programming languages.
They should also learn to work well with AI assistants, as senior
developers who can effectively guide and review AI-generated code will
eventually be more valuable. 

 HOW TO GET PROMOTED: LESSONS FROM AN EX-AMAZON VP (8 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Ethan Evans, an ex-Amazon VP, emphasizes understanding and addressing
the gaps (skills, relationships, or time) between your current role
and desired promotion while building trust and expanding the scope of
your work through consistent high-quality performance. He advises
adapting to your manager's style, involving mentors in your promotion
process, and building relationships with higher-level managers.

MISCELLANEOUS

 COUNTERSCALE AND THE NEW SELF-HOSTED (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Counterscale is an open-source web analytics service that is
self-hostable on Cloudflare's developer cloud. It can be deployed as a
single Cloudflare Worker that serves a JavaScript reporting snippet.
Counterscale hosts a reporting endpoint and has a dashboard UI written
in Remix. The heart of Counterscale is the Workers Analytics Engine,
which is a set of managed services built on top of Clickhouse that
allows for the writing and querying of analytics-style data at a
massive scale. The service is essentially free for most users as it
falls within Cloudflare's free plan limits. 

 THE ETERNAL TRUTH OF MARKDOWN (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Markdown is a popular markup language designed for easy reading and
writing of plain text. While it's simple and flexible, it also has
ambiguities in both syntax and resulting HTML output. Some programmers
tried to standardize Markdown with CommonMark, but Markdown's lack of
a single standard is actually its strength. 

 I FOUND AN 8 YEARS OLD XORG BUG (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This developer discovered an 8-year-old bug in Xorg (the open-source
implementation of the X Window System display server), where windows
would disappear even while the server was locked using the GrabServer
command. The bug was tracked down using eBPF and uprobe, which
revealed that it was a simple misuse of epoll that caused the server
to process close-downs even when it shouldn't. This bug likely went
unnoticed for so long because only compositors like picom need to know
about all windows, but don't have control over their closure, putting
them in a unique situation where the GrabServer lock is necessary.
