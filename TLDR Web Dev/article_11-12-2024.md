ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO ACTUALLY MIGRATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS IN INFRASTRUCTURE (14 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Migrating complex systems requires careful planning and execution to
avoid disrupting services and user experience. Approaches like hard
forking, splitting teams, or relying on single individuals are
discouraged. Instead, the "Strangler Fig Pattern" is recommended,
where the new system gradually replaces parts of the old system
without affecting customers, minimizing downtime and risk. 

 RUNNING DURABLE WORKFLOWS IN POSTGRES USING DBOS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DBOS, a durable workflow engine built on Postgres, uses Postgres'
features to store workflow state, providing "save points" that enable
recovery from crashes. DBOS functions, written in Python or
TypeScript, use decorators to manage workflow steps, storing each
step's state and output in the Postgres database for deterministic
execution. 

 INTRODUCING EFFICIENT VALKEY-BASED CACHING FOR NEXT.JS (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Server-side rendering in Next.js can be slow due to its CPU-intensive
nature, especially in horizontally scaled environments where caching
inconsistencies arise. Valkey, an in-memory data store, offers
performance gains through autopipelining, automatically batching
operations. It's a solution for shared caching that provides
consistent results across all instances.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FROM WHERE I LEFT (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After a four-year break focused on writing and family, Redis' creator
is returning to the Redis ecosystem. His decision stems from a desire
to contribute to the community, address its fragmentation, and help
shape the future direction of Redis development. It's a part-time
role. 

 THOUGHTS ON TAILWIND 4 (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tailwind CSS v4 has great improvements like the switch to
LightningCSS and native CSS cascade layers, but this author has
concerns about the performance implications of CSS variables, the
potential for abuse with new descendant variants, and the lack of
clarity in some class names.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 STOP IGNORING FLAKY TESTS… CATCH THEM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 You can shrug off flaky tests once or twice, but eventually they will
stall your pull requests and bum you out. Check out this article by
Artem Zakharchenko [9] to find out how you can use Codecov's Test
Analytics to flag unreliable tests early and keep your CI/CD running
smoothly. Read the blog [9] 

 INTRODUCING NETLIFY'S FREE PLAN (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Netlify has launched a free plan that offers 100 GB bandwidth, 300
build minutes, and other generous limits for deploying web projects. 

 INTRODUCING LIMBO: A COMPLETE REWRITE OF SQLITE IN RUST (9 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Turso announced Limbo, a complete rewrite of SQLite in Rust, aiming
for improved memory safety, modern architecture, and potentially
surpassing SQLite's reliability through deterministic simulation
testing, while maintaining compatibility and offering features like
asynchronous I/O and WASM support. 

 ELECTRIC BETA RELEASE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Electric, a Postgres sync engine enabling real-time data replication
for local apps, is now in beta after a six-month rewrite. It's used in
production by companies like Google and Supabase to handle
high-throughput workloads with low latency. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE GOOGLE WILLOW THING (28 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google announced its new 105-qubit superconducting chip, "Willow,"
which demonstrated a fault-tolerant surface code qubit and a new
quantum supremacy experiment. It's a major achievement in experimental
quantum computing, pushing the field closer to fault-tolerant quantum
computation. 

 HOW TO THINK ABOUT TIME (35 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Physical time (instants and durations measured in seconds) is
different from civil time (datetimes and periods based on calendar
systems like the Gregorian calendar), as there are more complexities
and potential for bugs when dealing with civil time. It's important to
use well-defined time zones (like those from the IANA database) and
avoid ambiguous types like "zoned datetime.” This guide provides
language-specific API recommendations for handling date and time
operations well. 

 DEVIN IS NOW GENERALLY AVAILABLE (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Devin, an AI code assistance tool that made the news a while back for
controversially claiming to be the first AI software engineer, is now
generally available. It's meant to handle small frontend bugs and edge
cases, first-draft PRs, and targeted code refactors.
