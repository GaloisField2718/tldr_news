 HOW LYFT PROCESSES TERABYTES OF REAL TIME DATA (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Lyft transitioned from using Apache Druid to ClickHouse for its
sub-second analytics system. The move was driven by several factors,
including a steep learning curve and maintenance complexity associated
with Druid, cost considerations, and ClickHouse's better alignment
with Lyft's infrastructure and engineering expertise. ClickHouse's
benefits included simplified infrastructure management, a reduced
learning curve for engineers, native data deduplication support, lower
costs compared to Druid, and specialized functionalities that made
various tasks easier. 

 HOW STANDARD EBOOKS SERVES MILLIONS OF REQUESTS PER MONTH WITH A 2GB
VPS (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Standard Ebooks served over a million ebook downloads with a VPS, all
without relying on JavaScript or a database. Instead, it used classic
web technologies and PHP in an efficient manner. The ebooks are
actually stored on Git repositories and an ebook build process is run
on the VPS whenever an ebook is released or updated. 

 MORE THAN YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT REACTDOM.FLUSHSYNC (7 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 ReactDOM.flushSync is a function that forces React to flush any
pending work and update the DOM synchronously. This post is an
in-depth look at what React does on updates and how flushSync can
solve problems when React updates the UI later than you need it to.
The article provides a good distillation of how React updates the DOM
even if flushSync isn‚Äôt used immediately in a use case.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 COLD-BLOODED SOFTWARE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cold-blooded software uses boring technology and can usually run
without changes for years. Warm-blooded software has more flexibility
but requires constant energy to maintain. It‚Äôs important to choose
the right context for a project. 

 WANT TO BE A BETTER LEADER? STOP THINKING ABOUT WORK AFTER HOURS (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Managers who continue thinking about work after hours may actually
harm their leadership performance. A study found that not taking a
break from work in the evening, especially for new managers, drained
their mental resources and reduced leadership effectiveness. Leaders
who mentally switched off from work the night before felt more
recharged and identified more strongly with their role as a leader. 

 WEBASSEMBLY: 4 PREDICTIONS FOR 2024 (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Four WebAssembly (Wasm) developments are anticipated in 2024: Wasm
becoming an ideal match for AI workloads, the completion of critical
Wasm standards, a shift towards server-side use cases, and the
emergence of web applications that can run Wasm on both client and
server sides. Wasm isn‚Äôt quite production-ready yet, but 2024 may be
the year that it makes the transition.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WILL US COMPANIES HIRE FEWER ENGINEERS DUE TO SECTION 174? (14 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 US software companies, particularly smaller ones, are facing
unexpected high tax bills due to changes in Section 174 of the US tax
law. This change requires R&D costs, including software engineer
labor, to be capitalized and amortized over 5 years (or 15 years if
labor is done outside the US). As a result, companies have to pay
taxes on profits they technically haven't realized yet, leading to
layoffs and reduced hiring of software engineers. Large tech companies
are able to manage the tax increase better than startups. 

 WHAT IS DESIGN TO CODE: AN AUTOMATED APPROACH (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Design to code is the process of automating the conversion of visual
designs into clean, functional code that matches the design's layout,
styling, and interactions. It involves collaboration between designers
who create visual designs and developers who translate those designs
into code using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. New AI tools
aim to automate the manual collaboration process. 

 RUST, RUBY, AND THE ART OF IMPLICIT RETURNS (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Implicit returns and if-expressions can lead to more concise and
readable code. This post provides examples in Rust, Ruby, and other
languages. On top of implicit returns, block expressions and single
expression functions are also useful to further simplify code.

 NPM REGISTRY PRANK LEAVES DEVELOPERS UNABLE TO UNPUBLISH PACKAGES (5
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 On December 29th, a package named "everything" was released to the
NPM registry that installed all other public packages. This resulted
in an extensive network of dependencies across the entire registry
that made it impossible to unpublish any package on the site. 

 HOW I READ BOOKS WITH LIMITED TIME (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Reading books on soft skills and leadership is useful in the
workplace as both a dev and a manager. To read books with limited
time, first start with book summaries to evaluate relevance, then read
selectively from the actual book while taking notes. Finally, connect
and apply the lessons to your own personal experiences. 

 1 BILLION ROW CHALLENGE (GITHUB REPO) [20] 

 The One Billion Row Challenge (1BRC) explores how far modern Java can
be pushed for aggregating one billion rows from a text file. 

 WHY SHOULD I USE GO OVER RUST, JAVA, OR PYTHON? (2 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Go is an "80%-language," meaning it can achieve 80% of the
performance and functionality of other languages with only 20% of the
effort.
