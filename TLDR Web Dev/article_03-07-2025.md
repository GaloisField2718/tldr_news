 HOW I SCANNED ALL OF GITHUB'S “OOPS COMMITS” FOR LEAKED SECRETS
(16 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A white-hat hacker found leaked secrets in deleted GitHub commits by
scanning force push events using the GitHub Event API and GH Archive.
He developed a tool to identify these "Oops Commits" and discovered
thousands of active secrets, including one that could have led to a
massive supply-chain compromise in the Istio project. The process
involved manual searching, a vibe-coded triage tool, and an eventual
AI-driven approach to identify valuable secrets. 

 REMIXING SHOPIFY'S ADMIN: HOW WE MADE IT 30% FASTER AND AI-READY (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Shopify rebuilt its Admin platform using Remix, which led to a 30%
performance improvement thanks to using Remix loaders for parallel
fetching and having intelligent prefetching. This rebuild also made
the system AI-ready by giving it structured route information and form
schemas after the rebuild. The system itself handles 67 million daily
page views and contributions from 101 teams with 350+ daily code
merges.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 STOP BUILDING AI AGENTS (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Devs often jump to building complex AI agents powered by LLMs when
simpler workflows would be better and easier to debug. There are
multiple LLM workflow patterns, like prompt chaining and routing, that
can solve many problems without the complexity of full-blown agents.
Agents, where the LLM controls the workflow, should only be
implemented for dynamic tasks requiring human oversight. 

 WHY I'M DIALING BACK MY LLM USAGE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 When rebuilding infrastructure with Go and ClickHouse, this dev found
that LLMs produced buggy and messy code, leading to a cycle of fixing
one error only to create new ones. This experience showed a gap
between the hype surrounding AI productivity and the reality of its
limitations in production environments. Instead, LLMs are best for
small tasks like refactoring. 

 HOW TO WRITE COMPELLING SOFTWARE RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENTS (11 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Release announcements should focus on how the user's experience is
improved, not just listing features or bug fixes. Instead of focusing
on what developers did, highlight what users can now do with the
software, using clear language and visuals like graphs and concise
demos. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GLASS3D GENERATOR (WEBSITE) [9] 

 The Glass3D generator allows devs to create a 3D glass effect (like
Apple Liquid Glass) and customize visual effects like blur, color, and
texture, with CSS code provided. 

 INTRODUCING THE FIRST ALPHA OF TURSO: THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF SQLITE (7
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Turso has released the first alpha of its SQLite rewrite, which
addresses SQLite's limitations like its lack of concurrent writes,
limited real-time capabilities, and a closed development community.
The alpha has an asynchronous interface to replace SQLite's
synchronous API and includes core database operations, though indexes,
multi-threading, and other advanced features are still in development.


 WHATSAPP-API-JS V6 (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 whatsapp-api-js is a TypeScript framework for server-agnostic
integration with the official WhatsApp Business API, with features
like message handling and webhook setup.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW LARGE ARE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS? (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article goes over how LLMs' sizes have changed over time,
starting with GPT-2 and GPT-3's parameter counts and training data
specifics and ending with the limited public information about GPT-3.5
and GPT-4. Models like Mixtral and Deepseek V3 use a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, which makes them harder to compare to
the traditional "dense" architectures. 

 THAT XOR TRICK (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The XOR (exclusive or) bitwise operation has its applications in
solving interview questions. The "XOR trick" is where duplicated
values in a sequence of XOR operations cancel each other out. This
trick can be applied to solve problems like in-place swapping of
variables, finding a missing number in an array, finding a duplicate
number, and even finding two missing/duplicate numbers. 

 LLMS AS COMPILERS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 LLMs can function as compilers in the future, transforming context
into software features. Instead of directly manipulating code,
engineers will focus on providing context, defining tests, and
iterating based on the results.

QUICK LINKS

 ALL HIGH VALUE WORK IS DEEP WORK, AND ALL MOTIVATION IS BASED ON
BELIEF (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 High-value work is always deep work, as focus and perseverance are
necessary to solve complex problems, while motivation is from having
strong personal beliefs from ego, prestige, distraction, gratitude, or
social connection. 

 MODERN NODE.JS PATTERNS FOR 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Important modern Node.js patterns for 2025 include using ES Modules
with the `node:` prefix for built-in modules, using top-level await
for better initialization, and using native web APIs like fetch and
AbortController to reduce external dependencies. 

 TARGET=_BLANK IMPLIES REL=NOOPENER (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Modern browsers automatically include `rel="noopener"` when
`target="_blank"` is used, preventing a security vulnerability where
the linked page could manipulate the original page.
