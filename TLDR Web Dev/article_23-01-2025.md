ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 AVOID MULTIPLE PAGE REDIRECTS: HOW REDIRECTS IMPACT PAGE SPEED (6
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Website redirects send users and search engines from one URL to
another, often using 3xx status codes like 301 (permanent) or 302
(temporary). While necessary for maintaining functionality after URL
changes, excessive or poorly configured redirects can delay page
loading, negatively impacting Core Web Vitals such as First Contentful
Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). 

 A COUPLE CSS TRICKS FOR HTML DIALOG ELEMENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article presents two CSS tricks for enhancing HTML `dialog`
elements. The first trick uses the `::backdrop` pseudo-element to blur
the background behind the dialog for a subtle visual effect. The
second trick disables page scrolling while a dialog is open using the
`body:has(dialog[open])` selector. This prevents the underlying page
content from shifting during interaction with the dialog.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR WFH LIGHTING TO REDUCE EYE STRAIN (8 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Working from home can cause eye strain, so optimizing lighting is
crucial. The ideal setup uses even, diffused light, balancing
brightness to avoid both overly dim and overly bright conditions.
Natural light is preferred, but artificial light should be
high-quality, dimmable, and flicker-free. Strategically placed lamps
can help diffuse light and minimize harsh shadows.

 The UX of login codes often suffers from delays, confusing messaging,
and annoying input fields. To make this experience better, focus on
delivering codes promptly, using clear and concise messaging, and
enable easy copy-paste or autofill functionality.
