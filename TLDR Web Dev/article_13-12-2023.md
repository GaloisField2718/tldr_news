ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 ZERO DOWNTIME POSTGRES UPGRADES (29 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Knock‚Äôs team successfully upgraded from PostgreSQL 11.9 to 15.3
with zero downtime using logical replication and various tools. They
were able to de-risk the upgrade process by monitoring it closely and
having carefully planned processes in place. This article explains
different options for upgrading PostgreSQL, including in-place
upgrades (not suitable for zero downtime), and replication-based
upgrades, which is what they chose. A replication-based upgrade
involves setting up publications and subscriptions, adding tables
incrementally, and carefully configuring source and destination
databases. 

 HOW TO CREATE AN AUTOMATED PROFILE README USING NODE.JS AND GITHUB
ACTIONS (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 GitHub gives you the capability to build a profile README, a Markdown
file that lives on your profile that can be used as a quick portfolio
to highlight achievements. This article covers how you can take your
profile README to the next level with scripting and CI/CR automation.
It shows you how to do this using a custom script built with Node.js,
the markdown-it library, the GitHub API, RSS Feeds, and GitHub
Actions. 

 BUILDING COMPONENTS FOR CONSUMPTION, NOT COMPLEXITY (23 MINUTE READ)
[12]

for a great user experience. This article discusses considerations for
responsive design within component libraries and suggests structuring
components based on the design and development team's specific needs

recommendations for structuring design systems within design tools
like Figma.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE VALUE OF REPAYING GOOD TECHNICAL DEBT (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Good technical debt, as opposed to bad technical debt, is
intentional, provides initial benefits, and is controlled through
tripwires to prevent excessive interest. Teams often struggle to
articulate the business value of repaying technical debt, leading to
the misconception that a total system rewrite is the only solution. A
simpler approach is proposed: identify hindrances to progress, capture
them on sticky notes with dates, and add dots each time they recur. 

 THE SURPRISING CONNECTION BETWEEN AFTER-HOURS WORK AND DECREASED
PRODUCTIVITY (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 With the results of a survey taken by 10,000 desk workers, Slack‚Äôs
Workforce Index uncovers some interesting key learnings about workday
productivity. The survey found that employees who step away from their
computers at the end of the workday register a 20% increase in
productivity compared to those who work after hours. Only 25% of
workers feel productive in the afternoon and workers who regularly
take breaks have 13% higher productivity.

generation, collection retrieval, horizontal item ranking, item

 GITHUB PRODUCTIVITY AT 30 BILLION MESSAGES PER DAY (10 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 GitHub is used by 85% of developers and serves nearly 400 million
repositories with a guaranteed uptime of 99.9%. GitHub supports 30
billion messages per day and therefore, increasing productivity within
the company increases overall productivity for a vast majority of
software developers. This article takes a look at the work done by
