 BEHIND THE SCENES: SPEEDING UP PGSTREAM SNAPSHOTS FOR POSTGRESQL (9
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 pgstream is an open-source change data capture tool that improved its
snapshot performance for PostgreSQL databases. The initial
implementation used native tools for schema capture and transaction
snapshots for data reads, but suffered from slow write speeds. By
switching to binary COPY FROM for bulk inserts and deferring index
creation, pgstream improved its snapshot performance, surpassing
pg_dump/pg_restore in speed. 

 SERVING 200 MILLION REQUESTS PER DAY WITH A CGI-BIN (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 1990s-era CGI can still handle over 200 million requests per day on
modest hardware using Go and SQLite. CGI's performance bottleneck was
traditionally attributed to the overhead of process creation for each
request, compounded by slow scripting languages. However, advancements
in hardware and the use of faster languages like Go and Rust have
improved CGI's efficiency and its ability to use multiple CPU cores
properly.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ASYNC QUEUE – ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROGRAMMING INTERVIEWS (CAN AI
BREAK IT?) (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This dev's favorite programming interview question involves an
asynchronous queue designed to prevent a faulty server from handling
multiple simultaneous requests from a single-threaded client. The
interview starts with implementing a `sendOnce` function and then
progressively adds complexity with features like minimum delays,
`sendMany` functionality, request cancellation, retries, and
prioritization. This question tests a candidate's ability to reason
about code, handle new requirements, and adapt to a single-threaded
environment. 

 WHY I DON'T THINK AGI IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER (21 MINUTE READ) [7]


 While LLMs are impressive, their inability to learn and improve over
time like humans hinders their economic value and widespread adoption
in white-collar jobs. While new AI computer-use agents are supposed to
be able to complete end-to-end AI tax preparation by 2028, these
timelines are highly uncertain. Solving continuous learning will lead
to a discontinuity in model value. 

 NVIDIA IS FULL OF SH*T (28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This dev criticizes NVIDIA for issues with the RTX 50 series launch,
including scalpers, melting power connectors, and misleading
marketing. NVIDIA prioritizes data center GPUs over consumer graphics
cards, leading to defective products with technologies like DLSS used
to compensate for insufficient hardware performance.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 OPENCODE (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Opencode is an open-source AI coding agent for use in the terminal.
It has similar capabilities to Claude Code but is provider-agnostic,
supporting Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and local models. Opencode has a
terminal-based user interface and a client/server architecture,
allowing for remote control from various devices. 

 OMNITOOLS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 OmniTools is a self-hosted, web-based app with a variety of online
tools for simplifying tasks related to coding, images, videos, PDFs,
and more. It processes files entirely client-side.

 MAKING LANGUAGE MODELS PLAY BABA IS YOU (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 "Baba is Eval" is a project that turns the puzzle game "Baba is You"
into a benchmark environment for language models. The project enables
models to fetch game states, control the level through actions like
movement and undo, and automate menu navigation. Initial experiments
with Claude 4 show poor performance, which means AI needs better
reasoning capabilities and context management for solving more complex
levels. 

 LOCAL-FIRST SOFTWARE: YOU OWN YOUR DATA, IN SPITE OF THE CLOUD (62
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 "Local-first software" combines the benefits of cloud apps, like
real-time collaboration and multi-device access, with the data
ownership and control of traditional local applications. This approach
prioritizes local storage and networks over centralized servers,
making data modifications and access faster and independent of
constant internet connectivity. Conflict-free Replicated Data Types
(CRDTs) are a promising foundational technology for achieving these
goals, but more research and experimentation are still needed. 

 HOW TO NAVIGATE THE AI DISTRIBUTION SHIFT (16 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The emerging AI distribution shift is happening quickly. To navigate
it, companies must strategically bet on a single AI platform,
prioritizing retention, engagement, and user quality over initial
scale, and understand the value exchange mechanisms at hand. Retention
and product quality still matter over all else, but taking advantage
of new AI distribution channels can launch products into escape
velocity.

QUICK LINKS

 DATA ON AI-RELATED SHOW HN POSTS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Hacker News data reveals a large increase in AI-related "Show HN"
posts, which now represent over 20% of the total, but these posts
receive fewer votes and comments compared to non-AI-related
submissions. 

 APPLE_GENERATIVE_MODEL_SAFETY_DECRYPTED (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 This repository contains decrypted safety filter files for Apple's
generative AI models and provides tools and instructions to extract
the encryption key and decrypt the overrides. 

 12-FACTOR AGENTS - PRINCIPLES FOR BUILDING RELIABLE LLM APPLICATIONS
(9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This post presents principles for building reliable, scalable, and
maintainable LLM-powered apps, with the core idea being that
successful LLM apps often rely more on traditional software
engineering than complex AI frameworks. 

 PROFILE README GENERATOR (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 This is a tool that makes the creation of customized GitHub profile
READMEs easier.
