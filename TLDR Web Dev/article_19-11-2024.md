ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW LINKEDIN USES EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURES TO SCALE (6 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 LinkedIn leverages event-driven architectures and the actor model to
scale its infrastructure. The actor model is a concurrent computation
model where independent actors communicate and coordinate solely
through asynchronous message passing. The company uses this approach
in several systems, including one for collecting and processing server
metrics in near real-time and another for monitoring server consoles. 

 SUPPORTING OFFLINE MODE IN TANSTACK QUERY (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Effect Schema, a validation library, can be used for achieving full
offline support with TanStack Query. It allows for bi-directional
parsing, eliminating the need for separate schemas for encoding and
decoding data. This article goes through how to store data locally
(using IndexedDB or LocalStorage), implement cache removal, set cached
data, and handle mutations. 

 REACTIVE HTML NOTEBOOKS (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Celine, a reactive HTML notebook library, can be used to improve
scientific publishing workflows by consolidating data exploration,
analysis, and typesetting within a single HTML file. The library uses
existing technologies like Observable, Plot, and various WASM runtimes
(Python, R, and SQLite) to enable interactive elements and diverse
data visualizations directly within the HTML document. This article
goes through various implementation examples, such as interactive code
cells, plots, and even a slideshow presentation mode.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AGAINST BEST PRACTICES (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blindly following “best practices” without considering context
leads to poor decision-making. Instead, each "best practice” should
be evaluated critically in the context of the application itself. 

 THE TRAGEDY OF RUNNING AN OLD NODE PROJECT (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This developer attempted to update their four-year-old Gatsby website
but ran into difficulties running the old Node project. The `npm
install` command failed repeatedly due to missing Python 2 and
incompatible C++ compiler versions. Troubleshooting involved
installing Python 2, discovering a required older Node.js version
(v12.2), and ultimately resolving the build errors after two hours. 

 SOCRATIC QUESTIONING - "MEETINGS ARE A WASTE OF TIME" (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 This article uses the statement "Meetings are a waste of time" to
illustrate Socratic questioning: clarification, challenging
assumptions, seeking evidence, changing perspectives, exploring
implications, and questioning the question itself. Each step is
demonstrated through examples related to the initial statement to show
how Socratic questioning can be used as a tool to think critically and
challenge prior assumptions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 20 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT GOOGLE SCHOLAR (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google Scholar, launched in 2004 by two researchers, aimed to improve
access to academic information by creating a comprehensive online
research library. Early challenges included slow internet speeds,
leading to the creative "Sneakernet" method of delivering research
data on hard drives. Beyond its core function, Scholar has revealed
unexpected uses, from family history research to uncovering unusual
and funny aspects within academic publications and legal documents. 

 AN UNCANNY MOAT (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The "uncanny valley” is a phenomenon where almost realistic
depictions of humans appear unsettling - this applies to AI.
Increasingly realistic AI chatbots, while convenient, erode our
ability to distinguish between human and artificial interactions and
potentially reduce empathy. Deliberately stylizing AI interfaces,
making them easily distinguishable from humans, could mitigate these
risks. 

 TRAITS ARE A LOCAL MAXIMA (22 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Rust's traits, while popular, suffer from the "orphan instance
problem," where implementing a trait for a type from a different crate
is restricted. This leads to potential coherence issues. A possible
solution is local coherence using implicits. While implicits address
the orphan instance problem, they introduce new challenges, including
increased code repetition, potential loss of correctness guarantees,
and reduced code readability compared to traits. Both traits and
implicits represent local maxima in language design, but each have
their own trade-offs.
