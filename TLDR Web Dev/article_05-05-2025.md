ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SEEKING AN ANSWER: WHY CAN'T HTML ALONE DO INCLUDES? (22 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 HTML doesn't have a native include feature similar to CSS' `@import`
or JavaScript's `import`. There are numerous existing solutions for
including HTML snippets, such as JavaScript, server-side directives,
and static site generators, but none are pure HTML. This article
explores the potential reasons for this, which include performance,
security, and complexity concerns like circular dependencies. 

 THE DAY ANUBIS SAVED OUR WEBSITES FROM A DDOS ATTACK (8 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The ScummVM project's server infrastructure faced a DDoS attack that
saturated resources and brought down their website. The attack
originated from numerous IP addresses, making traditional blocking
methods ineffective, and the URLs targeted were resource-intensive.
Anubis is a program that filters connections and uses a proof-of-work
challenge to distinguish legitimate users from bots, which ended up
mitigating the attack. 

 MOBILE BRIDGE: MAKING WEBVIEWS FEEL NATIVE (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Shopify's MobileBridge framework transforms WebViews to feel more
native by addressing three core issues: performance (reducing load
times by 75% through preloading), appearance (removing web elements
like zooming), and integration (having seamless web-mobile
communication). This hybrid approach allows Shopify to maintain
development speed while still delivering a near-native experience for
non-critical screens in their app (which is one of the largest
complaints of cross-platform frameworks like React Native).

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE ENSHITTIFICATION OF TECH JOBS (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tech workers are losing their privileged status and facing increased
exploitation. Tech companies are using AI as a narrative to justify
layoffs, increase workloads, and reduce benefits for tech employees.
New strategies may be needed for tech workers to protect their rights
and working conditions. 

 DON'T MAKE GOOGLE SELL CHROME (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Forcing Google to sell Chrome, despite its ad-market abuses, is a bad
idea. Chrome won the browser war fairly through genuine innovation and
its continued development is necessary for the web's advancement.
Google's investment in the web is driven by self-interest and benefits
the entire web in general. 

 PART 1: HOW WE FELL OUT OF LOVE WITH NEXT.JS AND BACK IN LOVE WITH
RUBY ON RAILS & INERTIA.JS (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hardcover, a book tracking app, migrated from Next.js to Ruby on
Rails with Inertia.js due to issues like unclear caching,
unpredictable costs, and slow development speeds in Next.js. The move
to Rails and Inertia.js allowed for server-side rendering, direct
database connections, and continued use of React, resulting in
improved Google Pagespeed scores and faster load times. Hardcover uses
Rails for backend logic and routing, while Inertia.js connects the
Rails backend with the React frontend for dynamic content.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW RIOT GAMES IS FIGHTING THE WAR AGAINST VIDEO GAME HACKERS (10
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Riot Games is aggressively combating video game cheaters using its
kernel-level anti-cheat system, Vanguard, which grants deep access to
users' computers to detect and ban thousands of cheaters daily in
games like Valorant. Riot uses strategies such as using Windows'
security features, fingerprinting cheaters' hardware, infiltrating
cheat communities, and even publicly discrediting cheat developers. It
categorizes cheaters by the types of tools they use. The company
strategically slows bans to keep cheat development from advancing too
quickly. 

 BUILDING A MORE ACCESSIBLE GITHUB CLI (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GitHub is committed to making its CLI accessible to all devs,
addressing the current gap in accessibility standards for terminal
apps. The recent Public Preview focuses on improving the experience
for users relying on screen readers, high contrast, and customizable
color options. The company is rethinking prompts and progress
indicators for screen readers and aligning color palettes with 4-bit
colors for better user customization. 

 DUCKDB IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT GEOSPATIAL SOFTWARE OF THE LAST
DECADE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 DuckDB's spatial extension has greatly lowered the barrier to entry
for geospatial data analysis, which has contributed to a recent surge
in interest and usage of geospatial tools.
