ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE NEW THREE-TIER APPLICATION (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Application architecture has evolved from the traditional three-tier
model to modern microservices-based backends. Nowadays, an
orchestration tier is usually needed to manage complexity but there
are limitations of existing DIY and dedicated orchestrator solutions.
However, a good approach to this is combining the orchestration and
application tiers using a lightweight library that persists execution
state in a database. 

 REACT TRENDS IN 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A major trend in 2025 is the increasing adoption of React Server
Components (RSC) as a standard and React Server Functions (RSF), which
simplify data fetching and mutations in both Server and Client
components. React is going through UI standardization through
libraries like Shadcn UI and tooling streamlining with tools like
Biome.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE WORST PROGRAMMER I KNOW (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Developer productivity metrics like lines of code are not always
accurate for engineers. Since many engineers often spend more time
architecting designs and mentoring others, this leads to lower lines
of code output. However, these types of engineers generally cause the
team overall to output more lines of code, so these metrics might be
better as a team-wide metric rather than an individual one. 

 CAREER DEVELOPMENT: WHAT IT REALLY MEANS TO BE A MANAGER, DIRECTOR,
OR VP (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Typical corporate "leveling" systems are often arbitrary. Instead, a
proposed simplified management hierarchy consists of three meaningful
levels: manager, director, and vice president. Managers execute plans
with support, directors drive results independently, and VPs are
responsible for creating and owning the plan. VPs, unlike directors,
are ultimately accountable for the results of their plans and cannot
hide behind prior approval if the plan fails. 

 DON'T BE AFRAID OF TYPES (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There's a common aversion to creating new data types in codebases,
which comes from a fear of altering the "grand design." However,
creating new types to group related values, even for specific
functions, makes code simpler and much easier to read. Devs should
create types whenever necessary.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 OVERCOMING TECHNICAL DEBT: TURNING PAIN INTO PROGRESS (SPONSOR) [13] 

 In this video, Prof. Rainer Koschke from the University of Bremen and
Paul Lambert from the Qt Group explore the concept of code debt [13]
from an academic and commercial perspective. Learn how to identify
technical debt, understand its financial impact, manage legacy code,
and future-proof your software. Watch the video [13] 

 FASTOPENAPI (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 FastOpenAPI is a Python library that generates and integrates OpenAPI
schemas. It uses Pydantic v2 for data validation and supports
frameworks like Falcon, Flask, Quart, Sanic, Starlette, and Tornado.
It auto-generates documentation in different formats and has features
like data validation, proxy routing, and integration examples. 

 CLAUDE DESKTOP COMMANDER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Claude Desktop Commander is a server that gives the Claude desktop
app terminal command execution, process management, and advanced file
editing capabilities through Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows
Claude to run terminal commands, manage processes, and perform
filesystem operations like reading/writing files, creating
directories, and searching for files. It also supports code editing
with surgical text replacements or full file rewrites, using a
search/replace block format. 

 MANIFEST (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Manifest is a "1-file micro-backend." It has features like
authentication, validation, storage, and dynamic endpoints, and can be
integrated into projects using a single command.

 THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IDENTITY CRISIS (19 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The rise of AI coding assistants is causing an identity crisis for
software engineers, who are shifting from hands-on builders to
orchestrators of AI-generated code. This transition challenges the
core satisfaction engineers get from creating solutions and mastering
technical skills. For devs to adapt to this change, they should
balance deep technical work with strategic AI orchestration. 

 PYTORCH INTERNALS (30 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This is a guide to the inner workings of the PyTorch library. It is
structured in two parts: (1) a conceptual overview of tensor
libraries, including data types, extension points, and automatic
differentiation; and (2) practical coding aspects with guidance on
navigating the codebase, kernel writing, and optimizing the
development workflow. 

 MOST AI VALUE WILL COME FROM BROAD AUTOMATION, NOT FROM R&D (27
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The primary economic impact of AI will come from broad automation
across various industries, rather than being solely focused on
automating research and development (R&D). R&D's contribution to
overall economic growth is smaller than commonly believed and
automating R&D is more difficult than it appears due to the need for
capabilities beyond abstract reasoning.

QUICK LINKS

 USE LONG OPTIONS IN SCRIPTS (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 For better readability and maintainability, always use long-form
options (e.g., `--create`) instead of short-form options (e.g., `-c`)
when writing scripts that use command-line utilities. 

 NEXT.JS MIDDLEWARE EXPLOIT: CVE-2025-29927 AUTHORIZATION BYPASS (1
MINUTE READ) [21] 

 CVE-2025-29927 is a Next.js vulnerability that allows attackers to
bypass middleware authorization by manipulating the
`x-middleware-subrequest` header - it affects versions 11.1.4 through
recent unpatched releases, though it has now been patched in Next.js
version 15.2.3. 

 YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING, AND THAT IS OKAY (3 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 It's okay to not know everything as a dev - instead, focus on
problem-solving, use your network, and always keep learning.
