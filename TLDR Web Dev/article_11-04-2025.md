ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 EVERY CACHING STRATEGY EXPLAINED IN 5 MINUTES (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The five common caching strategies software devs must know are
Cache-Aside (lazy loading), Read-Through, Write-Through, Write-Behind
(write-back), and Write-Around. The choice of strategy depends on the
application's specific needs, such as whether it deals with read-heavy
workloads, data consistency requirements, or write-heavy loads. 

 HOW THE COLOSSUS STATEFUL PROTOCOL BENEFITS RAPID STORAGE (7 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Rapid Storage on Google Cloud overcomes object storage limitations by
using Colossus, Google's internal file system, to get sub-millisecond
latency. Colossus provides a stateful protocol where clients get
handles containing file storage information, allowing for direct data
access and low-latency durable appends. Rapid Storage uses gRPC-based
streaming with these handles, which lets user authorization be
front-loaded, provides subsequent reads/writes directly to Colossus,
and has error handling during stream interruptions. 

 DEFAULT STYLES FOR H1 ELEMENTS ARE CHANGING (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Browsers are removing default styles for `h1` elements nested within
sectioning elements like `section`, `article`, `nav`, and `aside`,
which previously adjusted the heading size based on nesting depth.
Devs need to explicitly define font sizes and margins for `h1`
elements to avoid unexpected styling changes and failing Lighthouse
audits. Lighthouse will flag `h1` elements without specific font
sizes, and browsers like Firefox and Chrome are already implementing
or warning about these changes.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE PHONY COMFORTS OF USEFUL IDIOTS (19 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI skepticism often is falsely simplified into two camps: those who
believe "AI is fake and sucks" versus those who think "AI is real and
dangerous." This dichotomy is useless because it overlooks the nuances
of AI's reality, impact, and political economy. Instead, AI is better
viewed as a tool for shifting power away from individuals toward
centralized structures. 

 A CASE AGAINST MVPS: WHY I'VE GROWN TO HATE “THE LEAN STARTUP" (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MVPs are misused and lead to wasteful, unfocused product development.
Instead of immediately building MVPs, teams should first validate
their target user segment, business model, and potential growth loops.
Product teams can avoid building solutions nobody wants by doing the
strategic groundwork upfront.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FIREBASE STUDIO (WEBSITE) [9] 

 Firebase Studio is a full-stack AI workspace to speed up app
development by using AI agents for backend, frontend, and mobile apps.
It allows devs to quickly build by importing existing repositories or
using AI tools like App Prototyping and Gemini Code Assist. It also
has easy deployment to Firebase App Hosting. 

 LIGHTHOUSE SCORING CALCULATOR (WEBSITE) [10] 

 The Lighthouse Scoring Calculator provides a Lighthouse score based
on manual inputs, like LCP (Largest Contentful Paint). 

 PLEDGE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Pledge is a lightweight, thread-safe reactive programming framework
in Swift for simple state management and event propagation using
observables and global stores. It has features like thread safety,
priority notifications, rate limiting, and functional operators.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SO, I WROTE A BOOK: THE STORY BEHIND 100 GO MISTAKES (36 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 This developer wrote a book called "100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid
Them." It all started with a blog post that went viral. From there, he
got a publishing deal with Manning and had multiple reviews with
editing. The book became a success, with translations and recognition
within the Go community. 

 THE 2025 AI INDEX REPORT (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI performance continues to improve across benchmarks, adoption is
rising in various sectors, and investment is surging, especially in
the U.S. While the U.S. leads in model production, China is quickly
closing the performance gap, and responsible AI practices are growing
unevenly.

 TANSTACK ROUTER'S NEW FEATURE (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 TanStack Router's upcoming `intent` preloading feature will
intelligently predict user navigation based on cursor movement to
proactively load likely routes before the user interacts with a link. 

 A SURPRISING ENUM SIZE OPTIMIZATION IN THE RUST COMPILER (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 A surprising size optimization in the Rust compiler is for nested
enums, where the compiler cleverly reuses the tag space of the inner
enum within the outer enum to reduce the overall memory footprint. 

 .LOCALHOST DOMAINS (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A method for using custom `.localhost` domains to access locally
running web applications is to configure `launchd`, `/etc/hosts`, and
Caddy as shown in this post. 

 TOP 5 CSS NAVIGATION MENU MISTAKES (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Common UI mistakes in CSS navigation menus include small target
areas, improper use of Flexbox gap, unforgiving dropdown target areas,
lack of dropdown closing delay, and absence of animated anchor links.
