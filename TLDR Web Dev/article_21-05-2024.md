ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 RETHINKING TEXT RESIZING ON WEB (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Airbnb improved its website's accessibility by implementing font
scaling, allowing users to adjust text size independently from page
zoom. Unlike browser zoom, which can create layout issues on smaller
screens, font scaling only affects text elements, providing a better
user experience for those with low vision. Airbnb used rem units for
font sizing, as they are relative to the root element and provide more
consistent scaling than em units. 

 MIGRATING UBER'S LEDGER DATA FROM DYNAMODB TO LEDGERSTORE (11 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Uber migrated a massive amount of ledger data from DynamoDB to
LedgerStore. This migration was done using shadow and offline
validation to check data completeness and correctness. It rolled out
LedgerStore gradually with fallbacks by maintaining backups of the
original data.

 WHY I LOVE LARAVEL (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Laravel is a PHP framework for building web applications that is
popular due to its speed and the fact that it includes everything
needed for development. It has pre-built user authentication and
built-in tools for database interaction, background jobs, and email
sending. Deployment is also easy because the framework has dedicated
hosting solutions. 

 THE CHATGPT WRAPPER PRODUCT BOOM IS AN UNCANNY VALLEY HELLSCAPE (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many new AI businesses are wrappers around existing LLMs like
ChatGPT, especially in the content marketing space. While there are
promising applications of AI, these wrapper businesses are not among
them, as they often produce generic, unoriginal content.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 üëã GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [10]

‚úÖ Get to 80% test coverage in just 4 months.

creation.
