 META REVEALS THEIR SERVERLESS PLATFORM PROCESSES TRILLIONS OF
FUNCTION CALLS A DAY (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta‚Äôs internal serverless platform called XFaaS processes
trillions of function calls a day thanks to unique software
optimizations. This article describes how XFaaS works and the
optimizations Meta has performed to make its platform efficient, such
as utilizing just-in-time compilation. XFaaS solves common problems
that serverless platforms face, like lengthy cold start times, high
load variance, and overloading downstream services, with creative
solutions. The platform offers lessons for public
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) providers, like AWS Lambda, Azure
Functions, and Google Cloud Functions. It is useful for software
engineers working with cloud providers to understand how to make
serverless functions more efficient. 

 NEXT.JS APP ROUTER MIGRATION: THE GOOD, BAD, AND UGLY (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The Next.js App Router allows for better flexibility of layouts,
loading states, and initial data loading on the server. However, it
has drawbacks such as the need to add client-side fetching for live UI
updates, server-side errors being easily hidden, the inability to
implement route exit animations, and issues with routing type safety.
The Next.js App Router may not be fully production-ready yet as it
still has memory leaks and lower dev server performance. 

 HOW TO DESIGN RESILIENT AND LARGE SCALE DATA SYSTEMS (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Building a data system is incredibly complex, as each team, product,
and company has vastly different needs and requirements. Architecting
an efficient data system calls for considering three things: latency,
correctness, and scalability. This article thoroughly examines these
pillars of data systems while also exploring push vs pull
architectures, the CAP theorem, and choosing the right data store.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE: PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AT BIG TECH (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The primary reason for performance management in Big Tech is to
address employees' concerns about fairness and equity in compensation.
Many companies, including Google, have shifted to a peer-based
evaluation system to improve transparency and fairness. However, this
approach often leads to overly positive and vague feedback, making it
challenging to differentiate between employees. Ultimately, managers
still play a significant role in making decisions about promotions and
layoffs, leading to perceptions of favoritism or opaque committee
decisions. 

 HOW DO I NEGOTIATE SALARY WHEN I GET A JOB OFFER? (3 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Negotiations should be approached as a collaboration and open-ended
statements should be used to initiate the conversation. Before
negotiating, candidates should know the market salary ranges for their
role and set expectations to negotiate.
