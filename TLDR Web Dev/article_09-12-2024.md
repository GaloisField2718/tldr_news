ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WRITING DOWN (AND SEARCHING THROUGH) EVERY UUID (19 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The website everyuuid.com displays all possible UUID v4s, which was a
challenge because of the sheer number of them (2^122). To overcome
browser rendering limitations, the creator implemented a virtual
scrolling system that handled rendering and scrolling manually.
Generating and displaying the UUIDs in a seemingly random yet
consistent order required a custom algorithm that used a Feistel
cipher to achieve a bijective mapping for scrambling (so that each
UUID appeared exactly once). The creator added a search function
which, while not perfectly efficient, allows users to find UUIDs
containing specific substrings. 

 USING TRANSFORMERS.JS FOR AI IN THE BROWSER (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Transformers.js enables AI-powered tasks directly in the browser
using a simple pipeline API, supporting applications like sentiment
analysis, summarization, translation, and object detection. It
requires downloading significant model data but is lightweight enough
for progressive enhancement, making it practical for many real-world
use cases. An example is shown in this article through building an
application that detects cats in images using the device camera.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE 70% PROBLEM: HARD TRUTHS ABOUT AI-ASSISTED CODING (9 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 AI-assisted development helps with rapid prototyping and daily tasks,
but it still relies on human expertise for code quality and
maintainability. Experienced developers use AI to speed up known
tasks, while junior developers may struggle with AI-generated code,
often missing important edge cases and other performance
considerations. 

 WRITING SYSTEM SOFTWARE: CODE COMMENTS (27 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Well-written code needs comments. For example, the Redis source code
has comments that clarify not only what the code does but also the
crucial why, reducing cognitive load for readers. This article
presents nine categories of comments, ranging from function and design
comments to more nuanced types like "why," "teacher," and "checklist"
comments, with examples illustrating their utility. 

 THE 6 MISTAKES YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE AS A NEW MANAGER (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 New engineering managers often struggle due to the reluctance to
delegate tasks, a shift in dopamine sources from individual
achievement to team success, and the temptation to prioritize team
size over quality of output. Instead, they need to find the right
level of engagement with team projects (guided autonomy) and manage
perceptions both internally and externally.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING WAITLIST MODE FROM CLERK (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Waitlist mode is a new sign-up mode and component that lets users
register interest and join a waitlist for early access to your
product.

 JSON5 (WEBSITE) [11] 

 JSON5 is a human-readable extension of the JSON format that adds
features like comments and single-quoted strings, making it easier for
devs to write and maintain configuration files. 

 MISE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Mise is a command-line tool that manages development tools,
environment variables, and tasks, similar to asdf, direnv, and make. 

 COUNTLESS.DEV (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Countless.dev is a free, open-source way to see and compare every AI
model easily.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY GELSINGER WAS WRONG FOR INTEL (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Pat Gelsinger, the previous CEO of Intel, was the wrong CEO for Intel
due to an underlying arrogance and disregard for limitations. This was
evident in Gelsinger's narrative of his past successes, which
minimizes his role in past failures and overstates his impact on
competitors. Gelsinger's leadership perpetuated Intel's ingrained
cultural problems, including a failure to listen to employees and
customers. 

 HOW I ALGORITHMICALLY DONATED $5,000+ TO OPEN SOURCE VIA GITHUB
SPONSORS AND PYPI DATA (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This developer created an algorithm to donate $5,000 to open-source
maintainers on GitHub. The algorithm used GitHub Sponsors and PyPI
data to identify underfunded projects based on download numbers,
project size, security risk, and existing sponsorship. A weak
correlation was found between project popularity and funding.

QUICK LINKS

 WHY LEETCODE IS SO POPULAR (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 LeetCode's popularity in Big Tech hiring is from its efficiency in
filtering a massive applicant pool despite its imperfections, as
alternatives like practical coding assessments or work trials are too
resource-intensive. 

 THE BIGGEST SHELL PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A list of large and complex shell programs that prioritizes those
using sophisticated data structures and algorithms over simply large
numbers of lines of code, such as a bash line editor, a Kubernetes
implementation, and various other utilities. 

 POSTGRES FOR EVERYTHING (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 A catalog of all the things you can use PostgreSQL for, including
cron jobs, message queues, analytics, and more. 

 KINESIS.JS (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Kinesis.js is a JavaScript library that provides various components
for creating interactive, physics-based web animations using mouse
movements, scrolling, and audio input with features like
transformations, parallax effects, and path-based animations.
