 HOW TO SOFT DISABLE UNUSED FEATURES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When you've got billions of page views per month,¬†unused features
have a price - whether that's cloud resources or carbon emissions.
What can you do about it?

Leboncoin (part of Adevinta) used A/B testing to identify features
that weren't getting traction [4], and implemented a ‚Äúsoft
disabling‚Äù mechanism to prevent the feature from loading unless
requested. The result was a 40-75% decrease in API calls [4], with no
impact on business KPIs.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY GOV.UK'S EXIT THIS PAGE COMPONENT DOESN'T USE THE ESCAPE KEY (10
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 GOV.UK's Exit this Page component uses the Shift key instead of the
Escape key for its shortcut function due to several technical
limitations. The Escape key is not a reliable option because it's
commonly used by browsers and operating systems for other functions,
and its use is not always considered a user interaction by browsers.
Other keys like Control or Alt have their own challenges, so Shift was
chosen as the least flawed option. 

 JOHN CARMACK ON INLINED CODE (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Doom co-creator John Carmack advocates for inlining code as a way to
improve code clarity and reduce bugs. Inlining helps programmers
become aware of all the code being executed, eliminates the
possibility of functions being called from unintended places, and
reduces the risk of bugs stemming from state changes. As an example,
aerospace software uses inlining for reliability. 

 YOU DON'T KNOW JACK ABOUT BANDWIDTH (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Internet performance issues are often caused by latency, not
insufficient bandwidth. This latency is exacerbated by outdated router
software that leads to buffering and congestion, especially during
video calls and other high-demand activities. There are various
software solutions to address these latency problems at the ISP level
that have proven effective in the real world.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY THE ISO FORMAT HAS TO DIE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The ISO format is arguably outdated and should be retired. The image
format is better because it's simpler and easier to use. 

 WARM HANDOFFS (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Warm handoffs are when questions are redirected in chat channels to
the appropriate team and channel. By involving the initial contact in
the handoff, providing context, and ensuring the requester's continued
involvement, warm handoffs create a more efficient and collaborative
environment. An organization that encourages warm handoffs ends up
collaborating better over time. 

 HOW TO MAKE PRODUCT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR ARCHITECTURE PROPOSAL (14
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Software engineers should advocate for robust, well-designed
solutions, even if they require significant time and resources. It's
