ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CONTAINER QUERIES UNLEASHED (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 CSS container queries are powerful for responsive web design. A key
pattern highlighted by this article involves creating adaptable
sub-layouts within larger layouts, where inner elements reflow based
on their container's size, not the viewport's. Container queries solve
the problem of fragile media query breakpoints, offering a better
approach. 

 HOW LONG IS A SECOND IN JAVASCRIPT? (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Time in Javascript can be complex since its timekeeping (based on
POSIX time) differs from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). POSIX time
ignores leap seconds, simplifying calculations but causing
inaccuracies in applications that need precise time synchronization,
unlike UTC which incorporates leap seconds to align with Earth's
rotation. Two methods for handling leap seconds within POSIX systems
are "step adjustment" (abruptly shifting time) and "smearing"
(gradually distributing the adjustment). 

 JAVASCRIPT TEMPORAL IS COMING (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Temporal API is a new JavaScript feature designed to replace the
existing Date object. It addresses the limitations of the Date object,
such as poor time zone support and unreliable parsing, by providing
immutable objects, built-in time zone handling, and support for
various calendar systems.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ONCE YOU'RE LAID OFF, YOU'LL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN (13 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 After an unexpected layoff after a year, despite consistent high
performance and significant contributions to his company, this
developer details several warning signs of an impending layoff,
including canceled team events, unexpected package notifications, and
vague mandatory meetings. Individual contributions are often
overlooked in favor of spreadsheet-based decisions, leading to a
broken trust between employees and employers. 

 MY AFTERNOON PROJECT TURNED INTO FOUR DAYS OF AI LIES, USB CHAOS, AND
HARD LESSONS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A developer initially planned a side project for an afternoon.
However, it stretched into four days due to unreliable AI assistance
and USB communication issues. Their reliance on AI for coding led to a
buggy and unmaintainable codebase. 

 REACT IN 2025: DECISION PARALYSIS IS STILL THE DEFAULT (REDDIT
THREAD) [9] 

 There's an overwhelming number of choices in the React ecosystem in
2025, leading to decision paralysis for developers. The lack of clear
winners in build tools, state management, routing, and UI libraries
makes it difficult to choose a stack that won't quickly become
outdated.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 🟥→🟩 FOUR SIMPLE STEPS FOR BETTER INCIDENT RESOLUTION IN
DEVOPS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 If incidents could be planned for, they wouldn't be incidents. But
there are ways to help DevOps teams get systems from red back to
green, quickly. This guide by Datadog [10] outlines a simple 4-step
process for ensuring your organization's response to incidents is
efficient and effective. Download now [10] 

 ONLOOK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Onlook is an open-source Cursor for designers that allows live
editing of React + Tailwind CSS web apps directly in the browser. 

 CAP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Cap is a video messaging tool built with Rust, React, and other
technologies. It's currently in public beta for macOS and web. Windows
and Linux versions are under development. 

 POCKETPAL AI (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 PocketPal AI is an open-source mobile app that provides options to
use AI models locally and offline. Users can automatically manage
memory by offloading models when the app is in the background and
customize model parameters like the system prompt, temperature, BOS
token, and chat templates.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MY FAILED ATTEMPT TO SHRINK ALL NPM PACKAGES BY 5% (9 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 This developer proposed using the Zopfli compression algorithm to
reduce the size of npm packages by approximately 5% in a backwards
compatible way. His initial tests showed size reductions with minimal
performance impact, and he even implemented this in some of his own
popular modules. However, his formal request to npm maintainers was
ultimately rejected due to concerns about increased publishing times,
difficulties integrating Zopfli, and the lack of a clear benefit for
users despite the potential for large bandwidth savings. 

 RUNNING INFERENCE IN WEB EXTENSIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Mozilla has released a new API in Firefox Nightly that enables
offline machine learning tasks within web extensions using the Firefox
AI Runtime. This runtime uses Transformers.js and the ONNX runtime,
allowing for model execution directly on users' devices without
sending data to third parties. 

 SLACK OVERFLOW: HOW WE SCALED SLACK TO SUPPORT 1,000S OF DEVELOPERS
(12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Railway, a software infrastructure company, improved customer support
and sales engagement by integrating Slack. Initially, manually
creating Slack channels for each customer was unsustainable, leading
to the development of "Help Station," a custom support tool that
integrates with Slack. The result was a 50x increase in engagement and
8x faster response times.

QUICK LINKS

 CREATE-REACT-APP IS A ZOMBIE APPLICATION (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Despite being deprecated and removed from official documentation, the
React application generator `create-react-app` persists due to
outdated online resources, confusing new devs. 

 TWO PROGRAMMING-WITH-AI APPROACHES (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 There are two distinct, largely incompatible approaches for
AI-assisted programming: dialog programming, where AI aids human
coding, and commanding an AI to program autonomously. 

 SEE THE CODE THAT POWERED THE PEBBLE SMARTWATCHES (3 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Google has released the source code for the Pebble smartwatch
operating system to support the community maintaining these devices
after official support ended. 

 SUPERCHARGE SQLITE WITH RUBY FUNCTIONS (10 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 You can extend SQLite's functionality by creating user-defined
functions (UDFs) in Ruby, enabling custom operations within SQL
queries, including scalar functions for tasks like regex matching and
aggregate functions for statistical calculations.
