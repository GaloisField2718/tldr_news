 INCREASE DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY WITH POSTMAN'S API COLLABORATION
TOOLS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 To ship better software, API producers and consumers need to be able
to share, discover, and reuse high-quality API assets.

Postman revolutionizes the experience of collaborative API development
with Postman Collections [5] and Workspaces [6].

Used together, they enable API design, testing, and documentation
while providing a shared canvas for collaborating on API assets.

Learn how companies like Cvent [7], Visma [8], Built Technologies [9],
and Amadeus [10] use Postman to collaborate more easily and deliver
higher-quality APIs.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 EXPLORING HOW CACHE MEMORY REALLY WORKS (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Cache memory is a temporary storage located on the processor that
increases CPU efficiency by holding frequently accessed data. The CPU
cache is organized in levels (L1, L2, L3, etc.) with varying speeds
and sizes, with L1 being the fastest and smallest. Cache placement
policies determine where data is stored in the cache. Direct mapping
is one of the simplest approaches. Programmers can write
cache-friendly code by optimizing data locality, avoiding complex
loops, and using appropriate struct alignment and compiler flags. 

 THE MANY FACES OF UNDEFINED IN JAVASCRIPT (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 JavaScript's many methods of representing unknown values, including
null, undefined (as missing or value), falsy values, ReferenceError,
empty slots in arrays, -1, and TypeScript's void, causes confusion and
defects. 

 SIMPLE WAYS TO FIND EXPOSED SENSITIVE INFORMATION (6 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Search engine dorking is a technique that uses crafted queries to
find specific types of sensitive information on the internet, such as
leaked documents or API keys. Another way to discover sensitive data
is through GitHub dorking, which searches for accidentally committed
credentials or API keys in public repositories. Tools like PublicWWW
can be used to search for API keys and other sensitive information on
live websites, while tools like S3Scanner help find misconfigured
cloud storage buckets that expose private data.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 A BETTER WAY TO CODE: DOCUMENTATION DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (8 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Documentation-driven development (DDD) involves writing documentation
before coding, which can help clarify project scope and API design.
DDD can take many forms, such as design mockups, API reference docs,
tickets, or even tests. It is not a "write once and done" process but
rather an iterative cycle of refining both code and documentation. DDD
can help identify potential issues in the design phase, saving time
and resources in the long run. 

 THE PLAN-EXECUTE PATTERN (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The plan-execute pattern is a design pattern used to separate the
planning phase (decision-making) from the execution phase (actions)
when developing software. It helps in testing the decision-making part
and debugging by allowing inspection of the plan data structure. This
pattern is commonly used in various areas, such as query planning in
relational databases and interpreters. The execution phase can be
further split into a state machine and a driver loop to handle
uncertainties.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TAKE THE QUIZ: HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THE STATE OF AGILE TODAY?
(SPONSOR) [16] 

 Which % of organizations surveyed are using Agile? If you guessed
anything other than 94%, you'd be wrong. Take the one-minute Agile
quiz [16] to see what other insights you can uncover! The quiz is
based on Appfire's Agile report. Check it out [16] 

 V0 THEMES (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Vercel v0 is a tool that uses AI to generate and iterate upon
frontend components quickly. It now supports themes. Developers can
now create custom themes from prompts, modify individual design
tokens, and switch between different themes for their generations. 

 NODESWIFT (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 NodeSwift is a bridge between Node.js and Swift code. It makes it
possible to write Swift code that talks to Node.js libraries, and vice
versa. This means developers can use native macOS APIs from an
Electron app, npm APIs from a Swift app, and more. 

 OPENSTATUS (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 OpenStatus is an open-source performance monitoring platform. It
supports synthetic monitoring, which monitors websites and APIs
worldwide and sends notifications when they are down or slow. It also
supports user monitoring, which uses Core Web Vitals metrics to show
how users are experiencing your website.

 MEET FIGMA AI: EMPOWERING DESIGNERS WITH INTELLIGENT TOOLS (12 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 Figma AI is a new suite of AI-powered tools for Figma that helps
designers with tasks such as visual search, asset search, text
editing, image editing, prototyping, layer renaming, and design
generation. These features are powered by third-party AI models and
are free to use during the beta period. 

 DEEP DIVE INTO HOW PINTEREST BUILT ITS TEXT-TO-SQL SOLUTION (9 MINUTE
READ) [21] 

 Both WrenAI and Pinterest share their Text-to-SQL solutions and how
they built them. WrenAI and Pinterest both innovate in Text-to-SQL
with indexing and retrieval phases, though WrenAI distinguishes itself
through a semantic engine and robust user interaction features, while
Pinterest focuses on metadata-driven approaches and table
summarization. WrenAI has semantic modeling and user feedback
integration in its roadmap.
