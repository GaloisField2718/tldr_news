ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW DISCORD MOVED ENGINEERING TO CLOUD DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Discord successfully transitioned to a Linux-based Cloud Development
Environment (CDE) to address the challenges of a growing remote
engineering team. Its initial Kubernetes-based CDE solution proved
problematic, and switching to a VM-based offering provided a stable
and performant experience. The migration involved careful planning,
early feedback, and a phased rollout. 

 JSR: WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT DENO‚ÄôS NEW JAVASCRIPT PACKAGE
REGISTRY (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Deno, a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime, has launched a new package
registry called JSR to address perceived shortcomings in the dominant
npm registry. JSR offers a TypeScript-first environment, integrated
workspaces, and a focus on security and usability. Early reviews are
mixed, with some praising its potential for streamlining TypeScript
development and improving security, while others question the need for
yet another registry and express concerns about ecosystem
fragmentation. 

 HOW NETFLIX REALLY USES JAVA (22 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Netflix's Java architecture has evolved significantly from its
Groovy-based backend-for-frontend model. The company transitioned to a
GraphQL Federation architecture, eliminating the need for reactive
programming paradigms like RxJava. This shift simplified development,
as GraphQL's explicit field selection reduces the complexity of
creating device-specific APIs. Netflix heavily utilizes Java,
currently on version 17 with active testing of version 21, and is
looking forward to using virtual threads to scale easier.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW I ALMOST QUIT BECAUSE OF $75 (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This author shares three instances where they nearly quit their tech
job due to challenges such as budget frustrations, boredom, and
exhaustion. Each time, they chose to stay and found value in doing so
by reframing the situation. They focused on goals instead of perceived
injustices, looked for challenges both inside and outside of work, and
built relationships with others in the company. They found that a
longer tenure in a company increased their influence. 

 VSCODE + WSL MAKES WINDOWS AWESOME FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The creator of Ruby on Rails is surprised and impressed by the recent
advancements in Windows for web development. VSCode combined with WSL
offers a seamless Linux development environment within Windows.
Intel‚Äôs latest chips are able to build Docker images faster than
Apple‚Äôs M3 Max chips. Windows is quickly becoming a viable
alternative for web developers compared to macOS. 

 MORE FILES PLEASE (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Files are powerful because they serve as a universal medium of data
exchange between applications. They liberate your data, allowing it to
be accessed and manipulated by any app. This is in contrast to "app
first" organization, where data is often trapped within specific
applications in their private databases. While modern documents might
function like folders filled with links, genuine files offer greater
interoperability and protect against being locked into a single
software provider.

 GEMINI ADVANCED FAILED THESE SIMPLE CODING TESTS THAT CHATGPT ACED.
HERE'S WHAT IT GOT WRONG (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google‚Äôs Gemini Advanced was tested against ChatGPT with three
coding challenges - Gemini performed poorly comparatively. The first
challenge had both AI tools create a WordPress plugin - Gemini failed
to create a functional one. The second challenge had both tools
rewrite a function, but Gemini produced code containing subtle errors.
Lastly, both ChatGPT and Gemini were tasked with finding a bug within
some code, but Gemini gave vague advice. 

 ON THE IMPORTANCE TO MAKE GAMES DURING THE GAME ENGINE‚ÄôS
DEVELOPMENT (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 It is crucial to prioritize making actual games alongside the
development process when building a game engine. This will expose you
to the pain points and limitations of your engine from a game
developer‚Äôs perspective. There should be a focus on identifying
areas where your engine hinders the game creation process. 

 ALL YOU NEED IS WIDE EVENTS, NOT ‚ÄúMETRICS, LOGS AND TRACES‚Äù (8
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A common approach to observability focuses on the distinction between
logs, metrics, and traces. A simpler approach is to focus on "Wide
Events". Wide Events are essentially flexible data structures (similar
to JSON objects) that can store any relevant information. Meta has a
system called Scuba that demonstrates Wide Events. It has an intuitive
interface that allows for easy exploration and filtering of data,
empowering users to uncover unknown problems and quickly narrow down
the scope of issues.

 THE NEW NODE.JS MASCOT (X POST) [17] 

 The official Node account unveiled the result of the Node.js mascot
design contest that ran recently, and Node‚Äôs new mascot is‚Ä¶ Rocket
Turtle. 

 FINDING A BALANCE WHILE CODING (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 While code optimization is valuable, it should rarely become the sole
focus, as it potentially leads to sacrifices in code readability,
maintainability, or even functionality. 

 PACKAGE DEPENDENCY HELL (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 There are parallels between the struggles of dependency management in
software development and the imposed societal expectations that often
lead to burnout in life. 

 A RETROSPECTIVE ON REQUESTS (21 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The 'Requests' Python library is known for its user-friendly
interface that simplifies HTTP interactions, but it can be a pain to
work with for more complex use cases.
