ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 UNLOCKING THE POWER OF JSON PATCH (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 JSON Patch is a standardized format for describing modifications to
JSON documents that offers a simple and efficient method for applying
partial updates (especially over HTTP). It works by applying a
sequence of atomic operations, each specifying a type of change and a
path within the JSON document. This allows for precise modifications,
efficiency through transmitting only changes, atomicity for rollback,
and idempotency for safe retries. 

 SAMPLING WITH SQL (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 For efficient SQL sampling techniques for large datasets, the A-ES
algorithm can be used for weighted sampling without replacement. This
article explains a novel SQL-based approach for sampling with
replacement, using the A-ES algorithm and showing off its
effectiveness through a biased coin flip simulation. 

 THE PART OF POSTGRESQL WE HATE THE MOST (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 PostgreSQL's Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) has
shortcomings. Despite PostgreSQL's overall popularity, its MVCC design
suffers from several problems: excessive data duplication, table bloat
due to dead tuples, secondary index maintenance overhead, and
difficulty in managing the autovacuum process.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 OVERWHELMED AT NEW FAANG JOB (REDDIT THREAD) [10] 

 This Reddit user is overwhelmed by the immense size and complexity of
the codebase at their new FAANG job, which involves over 8 million
lines of legacy code with lost knowledge. Their task is to replace an
outdated build process with a new one using currently unsupported
technologies. Comments suggest that the author should prioritize
understanding the existing codebase, document their findings, build
relationships with colleagues who possess relevant knowledge, and
write test cases for legacy code before starting to make changes. 

 WHY I'M SKEPTICAL OF REWRITING JAVASCRIPT TOOLS IN “FASTER”
LANGUAGES (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The trend of rewriting JavaScript tools in "faster" languages like
Rust or Go overlooks JavaScript's capabilities for optimization that
haven't been fully explored. The perceived speed gap is often
attributed to low-hanging fruit and the advantages provided by
browser-based optimizations like bytecode caching and JIT compilation.
Moving away from JavaScript would create a more complex and
inaccessible ecosystem, hindering contributions and debugging. 

 SOFTWARE ENGINEER TITLES HAVE (ALMOST) LOST ALL THEIR MEANING (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The industry has rampant title inflation, with developers being
labeled "senior" with minimal experience. This devalues the title and
undermines the meaning of career milestones. The root of this problem
lies in a combination of fierce competition for talent, personal
branding pressures on social media, HR departments struggling to
categorize specialized roles, and companies using title promotions as
a retention tactic.

 DID AUTOMATTIC COMMIT OPEN SOURCE THEFT? (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Automattic, the company behind WordPress, has been accused of
open-source theft by its competitor, WP Engine, after it took
ownership of a popular plugin called Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) and
replaced it with a fork called Secure Custom Fields. This act involved
silently migrating over 2 million users to the new plugin and is
considered ethically questionable. 

 SPLIIT BY THE STATS: USAGE, COSTS, DONATIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Spliit is an open-source expense-splitting app that has seen over
150,000 visits and over 29,000 users sharing group links. While the
app is free to use, it costs the developer around $115 per month in
hosting fees, primarily for database usage. The app is currently
funded through donations, ranging from $6 to $107 a month. 

 THE AI INVESTMENT BOOM (12 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The AI boom is driving a surge in US investment in physical
infrastructure, particularly in high-end computers and data centers.
This demand is leading to record-high construction rates, increased
imports of computer parts, and massive investments from companies like
Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. While the AI boom has led to increased
employment in sectors like semiconductor manufacturing and
construction, it has not really impacted the traditional software
engineering job market.
