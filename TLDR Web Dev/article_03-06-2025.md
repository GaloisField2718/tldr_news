ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DO NOT ASSERT ON REQUESTS (DO THIS INSTEAD) (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Instead of directly asserting on API requests in UI tests, it's
better to focus on testing UI state. This is because users don't care
about API calls and only about the UI's behavior. For example, instead
of asserting that a POST /cart request was made, you should test that
clicking "Add to cart" shows the success message to emulate real user
experience. 

 NO SERVER, NO DATABASE: SMARTER RELATED POSTS IN ASTRO WITH
`TRANSFORMERS.JS` (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article goes over how to implement smarter related-post
suggestions for an Astro blog using Hugging Face's transformers.js,
without needing servers or databases. It uses embeddings, which
capture the meaning of text using numeric vectors, and cosine
similarity to find posts with similar content. The entire workflow is
shown: loading markdown files, generating embeddings with
transformers.js, calculating similarities, and displaying the top
related posts.

 MY AI SKEPTIC FRIENDS ARE ALL NUTS (15 MINUTE READ) [6]

 AI AND THE RISE OF JUDGEMENT OVER TECHNICAL SKILL (3 MINUTE READ) [7]

tools are democratizing various fields by lowering technical barriers
and allowing anyone to produce professional-looking results. The real
value now lies in making thoughtful decisions about what to create,
how to approach problems, and how to evaluate quality.

 DECORATIVE TEXT WITHIN HTML (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Decorative text and unconventional spacing can be used within HTML
attribute values to improve readability. Techniques like brackets,

 AI MAKES THE HUMANITIES MORE IMPORTANT, BUT ALSO A LOT WEIRDER (14
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Generative AI presents both challenges and opportunities for the
humanities. AI elevates the importance of humanistic skills,

also undermines core aspects of education by letting students bypass
real intellectual engagement.
