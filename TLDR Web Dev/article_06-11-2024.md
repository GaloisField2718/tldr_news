ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FROM NAPTIME TO BIG SLEEP: USING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS TO CATCH
VULNERABILITIES IN REAL-WORLD CODE (13 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google's AI agent, Big Sleep, discovered an exploitable stack buffer
underflow in SQLite. This marks the first publicly known instance of
an AI agent finding a previously unknown exploitable memory-safety
issue in widely used real-world software. 

 HACKING 700 MILLION ELECTRONIC ARTS ACCOUNTS (19 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This developer found a vulnerability in EA's authentication system
that allowed him to manipulate user accounts. The vulnerability
involved exploiting exposed API documentation and a single insecure
endpoint. It allowed him to steal usernames and game data, ban
accounts, and even bypass game bans. The vulnerability was eventually
patched by EA. The scenario highlights the need for more bug bounty
programs for popular software. 

 WHY CODE SECURITY MATTERS - EVEN IN HARDENED ENVIRONMENTS (12 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 There is an Arbitrary File Write vulnerability in Node.js that can be
exploited to gain remote code execution access, even on a read-only
filesystem, by using pipe file descriptors in the /proc filesystem.
This post explains how attackers can bypass hardened infrastructure
measures by using controlled data structures to manipulate event
handlers. It also goes over how to protect against this.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO BECOME A MORE EFFECTIVE ENGINEER (26 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Software engineers need to understand the dynamics of their
organization to be successful. Beyond technical skills, they need to
develop soft skills, understand implicit organizational hierarchies,
and navigate company cultures properly. Embrace messiness, find small
wins, and recognize organizational constraints. 

 BEING THE "DOCUMENTATION" PERSON OR THE "TECH DEBT" OR THE "TESTING"
PERSON (REDDIT POST) [8] 

 A Reddit poster is frustrated by being consistently assigned tasks
like documentation, tech debt, and testing, even though they believe
these responsibilities should be shared by the whole team. Commenters
provide various suggestions, such as helping shift team culture to
make these tasks shared and resisting such tasks passively. 

 THE PRESIDENT'S DOCTOR: WHY YOUR PROJECTS TAKE FOREVER (17 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Optimizing for “work-unit efficiency” is more important than
individual worker efficiency. Work-unit efficiency is the concept of
creating the most work in the least amount of time and effort needed.
Developers should use a Kanban-based approach to prioritize work-units
and reduce waiting periods between work.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BROWSER-USE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Browser-Use is an open-source web automation library that allows
users to interact with websites using any language model through a
simple interface. 

 EDGE.JS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Edge.js is a library that enables in-process execution of .NET and
Node.js code on Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing developers to call
.NET functions from Node.js and vice versa.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STATE OF PYTHON 3.13 PERFORMANCE: FREE-THREADING (10 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Python 3.13 introduces free-threading, an experimental feature that
allows CPython to run without the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL),
leading to better utilization of multi-core processors. Free-threading
significantly improves performance, but it also introduces a
performance penalty for other implementations due to the disabling of
the specialized adaptive interpreter. 

 WHY SOFTWARE ONLY MOVES FORWARD (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Software only moves forward at scale because rollbacks and cut-overs
are near impossible due to the nature of data and distributed systems.
Data, once stored, cannot be easily removed or altered, meaning
software must adapt to handle outdated information. At scale, systems
are constantly running multiple versions of code, making it impossible
to stop traffic and switch to a new version. 

 BLOG WRITING FOR DEVELOPERS (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A good structure for developers writing blogs is: tell them what
you'll tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them. This
keeps blogs clear and concise, as often developers want to consume
just the important information without fluff.
