ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE TRAGIC RACE CONDITION (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Therac-25, a radiation therapy machine, suffered from a software
flaw that led to fatal radiation overdoses for multiple patients. The
machine's software contained a race condition ‚Äì safety settings
would be ignored if operators entered commands too quickly in a
specific sequence, leading to massive radiation doses. Between 1985
and 1987, at least six patients received lethal levels of radiation,
causing severe injuries, disability, and death. The disasters stemmed
from multiple failures, such as poor software development practices,
inadequate testing, overconfidence in the system's safety, and a lack
of regulatory oversight. 

 TYPE SYSTEM OF THE REACT COMPILER (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 React's compiler leverages type inference to optimize memoization in
components. It infers types for variables and functions based on their
usage in JavaScript code. By understanding that values used in
arithmetic operations are primitives, the compiler can avoid
unnecessary memoization with React.memo or useMemo. 

 HOW TO KEEP YOUR PRODUCT ALIVE: POOR MAN'S SRE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SRE practices ensure a product works consistently without major
issues as it grows. A stack of reliable tools is crucial for SRE. This
can include tooling for server/network monitoring, log storage and
analysis, SQL-based reports and dashboards, and application error
monitoring. Use ‚Äúboring‚Äù and cost-effective tools, especially for
small software businesses.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BRUTALLY HONEST CAREER ADVICE TO MY YOUNGER SELF (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 It's normal to feel lost, but focusing on consistent action is more
important than having a perfect long-term plan. Take risks, connect
with others, surround yourself with inspiring people, and document
your journey to attract opportunity and build resilience. Don't let
insecurity or the opinions of others hold you back. Instead, focus on
doing work you love, and remember that patience and positive self-talk
are important to long-term success. 

 IMPROVING OKRS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To improve OKRs, make sure that objectives clearly describe desired
outcomes using a "truth statement" format without numerical targets.
Define key results as measurable evidence that the objective has been
achieved, focusing on outcomes rather than activities. Prioritize a
small number of OKRs that align horizontally across the organization
and explicitly balance change-focused OKRs with metrics (like KPIs)
that track the ongoing health of the business. 

 FIVE THINGS SOFTWARE ENGINEERS CAN LEARN FROM MEDICINE/DENTISTRY (7
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Strong diagnostic skills are more important than technical skills in
software development, just as in medicine. Interview candidates by
having them debug existing code rather than writing new code.
Developers should assume positive intent and understand context before
judging code. They should also prioritize insights from product users
over the creators of the product itself.

 MARKING THE WEB‚ÄôS 35TH BIRTHDAY: AN OPEN LETTER (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is concerned about its
current state, which is characterized by centralized power, erosion of
individual control over data, and harmful societal impacts. He
believes the web has strayed from its original intent of fostering
collaboration, creativity, and compassion. To counter this, he
advocates for breaking down data silos, supporting a new generation of
innovators building a human-centered web, and embracing initiatives
like the Solid Protocol that prioritize individual data ownership. 

 THE REDDITS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 In this article, Paul Graham describes his early encounters with
Reddit founders Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian. He explains how,
despite a rejected initial idea, he saw their potential and suggested
they create a link-sharing platform inspired by the popular Delicious
feature, which became Reddit. The site grew rapidly thanks to its
user-driven content model and the founders' intellectual curiosity. 

 REDIS ADOPTS DUAL SOURCE-AVAILABLE LICENSING (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Redis has announced a change to its licensing model, moving away from
the BSD license to dual licensing under the Redis Source Available
License and the Server Side Public License. This change prevents cloud
providers from offering Redis as a service without collaboration or
contributing back to Redis development. Existing developers and users
of the Redis community edition will see little change and can continue
to utilize Redis under permissive terms.
