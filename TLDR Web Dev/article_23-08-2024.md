 CONTINUOUS REINVENTION: A BRIEF HISTORY OF BLOCK STORAGE AT AWS (25
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Elastic Block Store (EBS) at AWS has evolved from simple shared
drives to a massive, distributed SSD system delivering over 140
trillion operations daily. This post shares key lessons learned over
the years, emphasizing the importance of incremental improvements,
comprehensive instrumentation, and the power of constraints to drive
innovation. It also discusses how a team tackled performance
challenges by addressing the entire system stack, from the hypervisor
to the network, and ultimately by building their own SSDs optimized
for EBS. 

 STRLCPY AND HOW CPUS CAN DEFY COMMON SENSE (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 strlcpy is a string copying function that traverses the source string
only once, compared to strlen + memcpy, which traverses it twice.
While it seems intuitive that a single traversal should be faster,
benchmarks show that the double traversal method is often
significantly faster, particularly for larger strings. This is due to
the fact that CPUs can execute independent instructions in parallel,
and the memcpy loop in strlen + memcpy has fewer dependencies than the
fused loop in strlcpy, allowing for greater parallelism. 

 WHAT IS UDP? (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 UDP is a networking protocol that adds port numbers to IP packets,
allowing programs on a host to communicate directly with each other.
It's often described as "connectionless" and "unreliable" because it
doesn't guarantee delivery of packets, but this makes it ideal for
situations where speed and efficiency are important. UDP is used in a
wide variety of applications, including live video streaming, online
gaming, and VPNs like WireGuard.

 ASK HN: WHAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST STARTUP FAIL? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [8] 

 Hacker News commenters detail various reasons why their startups
failed. Some were too ambitious with their MVPs, while others tried to
compete on price in a market that wasn't as price-sensitive as
expected. Other people built something that people didn't want, while
others hired people too early. 

 HOW TO GET A JOB AT A STARTUP (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To stand out in competitive startup hiring, tailor your application

 PYTHON'S PREPROCESSOR (15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Python has a powerful preprocessor that allows users to extend its
functionality in unexpected ways, despite the common misconception
that it lacks one. It uses custom codecs and path configuration files,
allowing the interpreter to interpret code written in different
languages. This article explores various examples, such as adding
unary increment/decrement operators, interpreting C/C++ code using
cppyy, and validating TOML files with jsonschema. 

 NOTRIS: A TETRIS CLONE FOR THE PLAYSTATION 1 (21 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This developer created a homebrew PSX game called "Notris" in C using
modern tools. Driven by the desire to understand classic PSX
development, they chose to work directly with the PSNoobSDK and C,
learning the intricacies of PSX graphics and programming. They started
with a JavaScript prototype, then transitioned to C, building a Tetris
clone that is playable on original PSX hardware. 

 CONSTRAINING WRITERS IN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article discusses strategies for minimizing data loss in
distributed storage systems by constraining how data is written across
multiple nodes. It explores the concept of "copysets," where data is
written to specific subsets of nodes, reducing the probability of
losing data due to node failures. This approach contrasts with simple
replication, where data is written to randomly chosen nodes,
increasing the risk of data loss as the number of nodes grows.
