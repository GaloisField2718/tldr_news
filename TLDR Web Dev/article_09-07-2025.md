ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THINK BEFORE YOU CACHE (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 There are four key questions to consider when caching: whether
caching is the right solution, what should be cached, where to store
it, and how/when it should expire. This article discusses various
caching approaches in Rails (view/fragment, page, controller/action,
object/model, and low-level caching) and different storage options,
from in-memory stores like Redis to the new Rails 8 default Solid
Cache, which uses database-backed storage optimized for modern SSDs. 

 TAKING OVER 60K SPYWARE USER ACCOUNTS WITH SQL INJECTION (7 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 This developer discovered a SQL injection vulnerability in the
Catwatchful stalkerware service that allowed him to access its
database. He successfully dumped the 'user' table, gaining access to
over 60,000 plaintext usernames and passwords.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WE REACHED $1M ARR WITH ZERO FUNDING (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ProjectionLab is a financial planning tool that was bootstrapped to
$1 million in annual recurring revenue in four years. It started as a
side project inspired by the financial independence movement. It
wasn't an easy journey, due to the emotional rollercoaster of
entrepreneurship and the transition from solo development to building
a team. 

 STOP FORCING AI TOOLS ON YOUR ENGINEERS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Managers should stop forcing AI tools on engineers and instead focus
on outcomes rather than tool adoption. Mandating specific AI tools,
creating AI-usage metrics for performance reviews, and eliminating
traditional coding methods lead to slower development and messy
codebases. 

 YOU SHOULD DELETE TESTS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While automated tests are necessary for maintaining confidence when
making code changes, they should be deleted when they are flaky. Tests
that are flaky, too strict, too slow to run regularly, or outdated due
to changed business requirements all harm developer productivity.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 VIBE CODING MEETS VIBE CHECKING. (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Pair your favorite AI code writing tool with Korbit's instant,
AI-powered code reviews [9]. Korbit catches real bugs, explains how to
fix them, and flags performance, security, and logic issues with deep
codebase understanding. Get AI-powered code reviews to improve the
quality and match the pace of your AI code writing tools.

 INSTANTDB (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Instant is a modern Firebase alternative that provides a real-time
database for frontend apps. It makes development easier by handling
data fetching, permission checking, and offline caching, allowing
developers to focus on building user interfaces. Instant supports
relational queries, optimistic updates, and multiplayer functionality
by default. 

 BRUT RB (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Brut is a Ruby-based framework for building web apps with HTML,
JavaScript, CSS, and database interactions. It's structured around
concepts like pages, forms, handlers, and components for the
front-end, and database models and domain logic for the back-end. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 SUPABASE MCP CAN LEAK YOUR ENTIRE SQL DATABASE (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Supabase's MCP integration can lead to the leakage of sensitive SQL
database information. The attack involves a malicious user crafting a
support ticket message that instructs an LLM, operating with elevated
privileges (service_role), to extract data from sensitive tables and
insert it into a user-accessible support thread. The main issue is the
LLM's inability to distinguish between legitimate data and malicious
instructions embedded within user-provided text. 

 REACT ROUTER OPEN GOVERNANCE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 React Router is adopting an open governance model with a Steering
Committee to guide the project's future development, moving away from
founder-led decision-making to a more community-driven approach. The
team will simplify React Router by reducing API surface area, focusing
on core routing functionality, and deprecating APIs that overlap with
new React features like built-in `title`, `meta`, and `link`
components.

 STEVE BLANK BLIND TO DISRUPTION ‚Äì THE CEOS WHO MISSED THE FUTURE
(10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Over 4,000 carriage companies failed to adapt to the disruptive
technology of automobiles in the early 20th century. 

 SVGS THAT FEEL LIKE GIFS (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 High-resolution, animated SVGs can be created using asciinema and
svg-term-cli, which can be embedded in GitHub READMEs and work by
animating SVG attributes using `animate`, `animateTransform`, and
`animateMotion` tags. 

 AI EXTERNAL COMMENTS (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Using external AI conversation links in code comments is a code
smell, and instead, code should be self-contained and explainable
through executable tests, descriptive inline examples, and constants. 

 HOW JSDOC SAVED MY DEV WORKFLOW (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Using JSDoc, along with TypeScript compiler support in VS Code and
ESLint, provides a valuable type-checking and development workflow for
JavaScript projects where TypeScript is not a viable option.
