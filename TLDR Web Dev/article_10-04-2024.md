ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REDDIT'S ARCHITECTURE: THE EVOLUTIONARY JOURNEY (18 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Reddit started as a monolithic Python application and has evolved its
architecture into smaller microservices in Golang. It replaced
database snapshots with real-time data replication using Kafka. Reddit
has a dedicated metadata store built with AWS Aurora Postgres and it
uses Flink Stateful Functions for modern rule-based content
moderation. 

 EXPLORING SERVER ACTIONS WITH NEXT.JS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This tutorial teaches how to use Next.js Server Actions for
manipulating data. Server Actions, combined with React Server
Components (RSC) and the App Router, can be used to edit entities
within the database without the need to convert Server Components to
Client Components for database interactions.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 4 WAYS GITHUB ENGINEERS USE GITHUB COPILOT (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 GitHub engineers use GitHub Copilot to semi-automate repetitive tasks
like protobuf ID number generation. It also helps them stay focused by
generating regular expressions on the fly. GitHub Copilot can be used
for documenting code properly. 

 TECH NOTES: COMPLEXITY IS THE ENEMY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Simpler code is easier to understand and manage. Establishing clear
design goals and non-goals can prevent over-engineering when
complexity creeps in. Using less powerful tools can sometimes lead to
simpler solutions as the constraints force less complex designs. 

 THE DEBUGGER'S TOOLKIT (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Great debuggers follow systematic processes rather than haphazardly
tweaking code. They constantly form and test hypotheses, take breaks,
and document their learnings from debugging.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GEMINI CODE ASSIST (WEBSITE) [9] 

 Gemini Code Assist offers AI-powered assistance to software engineers
in their IDE, similar to GitHub Copilot. It is available to try at no
cost until July 11. 

 CHRONON (WEBSITE) [10] 

 Airbnb has open-sourced Chronon, which is an open-source end-to-end
feature platform that allows machine learning teams to easily build,
deploy, manage, and monitor data pipelines for machine learning.
It‚Äôs currently used by Airbnb and Stripe for major use cases
internally. 

 DRAWDB (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 DrawDB is a database entity relationship editor right in the browser.
It can be used to build diagrams with a few clicks, export SQL
scripts, and more.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DATADOG HAS A SECURITY FOOTGUN (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Datadog's Real User Monitoring (RUM) package has an API that can lead
to sensitive user data being accidentally sent to unintended domains.
The "site" parameter can be confusing - developers can easily mistake
it for their website domain. Instead of defaulting to Datadog's data
intake domains, the RUM package constructs a new domain based on the
provided "site" value, which could potentially send data to a domain
the developer doesn't control. This happened to a company called
Corporate Clash, where a misconfiguration led to user data being sent
to an unauthorized third-party domain. 

 GOOGLE UNVEILS GEMINI CODE ASSIST AND I'M CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC IT
WILL HELP PROGRAMMERS (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google‚Äôs new Gemini Code Assist is an AI-powered coding assistant
that helps programmers streamline development tasks. It runs within
popular IDEs and can generate code, explain existing code, and assist
with large-scale codebase changes. However, similar to GitHub Copilot,
it can‚Äôt write code completely by itself and will probably need
developer oversight to be fully effective.

development practices. 

 ZX (GITHUB REPO) [16]

command handling and better process control, but changes some defaults
and removes the SSH API. 

 INTRODUCING GOOGLE‚ÄôS NEW ARM-BASED CPU (6 MINUTE READ) [17]
