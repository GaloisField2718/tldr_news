ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ORDINARY FUNCTIONS AND ARROW FUNCTIONS
IN JAVASCRIPT? (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 JavaScript has three ways to create functions: function declarations,
function expressions, and arrow functions. The main differences are
that arrow functions are more concise (using `=>` syntax) and don't
have their own bindings to `this`, making them behave differently when
used as object methods. Arrow functions also cannot be used as
constructors with the `new` keyword, unlike regular functions, which
can serve as constructor functions in older JavaScript patterns. 

 COLOCATING AGENT INSTRUCTIONS WITH ENG DOC (25 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Putting agent instructions within existing engineering documentation
can avoid information duplication. After doing so, this method was
tested with the Gemini CLI AI agent, which successfully followed
instructions to convert a code example into a buildable and testable
component. 

 NEXT.JS PROMISE RACING (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 "Promise racing" is where the server waits for a promise to resolve
unless it takes longer than a specified timeout (in this case, 1
second). If the promise resolves quickly, the data is sent directly to
the client without any loading state, but if it takes too long, a
loading spinner is shown while the promise continues resolving on the
client side. This provides performance benefits by avoiding
unnecessary loading states for fast requests while still gracefully
handling slower ones.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FLOUNDER MODE (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The "Hollywood style" of pursuing various creative endeavors
conflicts with the Silicon Valley pressure to achieve unicorn status
through a single company. However, a joyful, interest-driven approach
to work can be both fulfilling and impactful. It's also important to
resist pressures at first to find your strengths and interests. 

 YOU ARE WHAT YOU LAUNCH: HOW SOFTWARE BECAME A LIFESTYLE BRAND (9
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Software has transitioned from being purely functional to becoming a
form of self-expression and a lifestyle brand. The apps people choose,
like Notion and Obsidian, signal taste and align them with specific
tribes or identities. Companies are now focusing on aesthetics and
vibes in addition to functionality, creating tools that reflect and
reinforce a curated image.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 PENNYBASE (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Pennybase is a lightweight, file-based Backend-as-a-Service written
in Go, with core backend features like a REST API, authentication,
RBAC, and real-time updates, all without external dependencies. It
stores data in CSV files with schema definitions for JSON mapping and
uses an in-memory index for faster lookups. 

 OPENING UP ‚ÄòZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOF' TECHNOLOGY TO PROMOTE PRIVACY IN
AGE ASSURANCE (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google has open-sourced its Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) libraries to
promote privacy in age assurance and digital ID solutions. ZKP allows
users to prove certain facts about themselves, such as being over 18,
without revealing any other personal information.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (AND ANSWERS) ABOUT AI EVALS (30 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 This is a comprehensive overview of how to evaluate LLMs, with
practical advice and opinions. For example, it's better to build
custom annotation tools for faster iteration instead of using
off-the-shelf options. Also, it's better to use binary pass/fail
evaluations over Likert scales for clearer LLM thinking. 

 TOOLS: CODE IS ALL YOU NEED (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Instead of relying heavily on MCP for automation, it's better for
LLMs to generate code that can then be executed and validated. LLMs
are currently better at writing tool-use code where the code is meant
to call other tools through APIs.

 WASM-AGENTS: AI AGENTS RUNNING IN YOUR BROWSER (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Wasm-agents is a project by Mozilla that shows how to create AI
agents that run directly in a web browser using WebAssembly and
Pyodide. 

 SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY ON A CODING AGENT (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Allen Pike describes his team's surprising success and
cost-effectiveness in using large language models like OpenAI's o3 for
coding. 

 WRITING CODE WAS NEVER THE BOTTLENECK (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While LLMs have reduced the cost of writing code, the real bottleneck
in software engineering remains understanding, testing, and
maintaining code. 

 THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF CODING CAREERS AND WHY I'M STILL HOPEFUL (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Despite anxieties about AI and recent tech layoffs, this dev is
hopeful for the future of coding careers because human ingenuity is
still necessary.
