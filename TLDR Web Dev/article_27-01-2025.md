 😘 KISS MANUAL TESTING GOODBYE—SHIP 5X FASTER (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Build features without the drag of multi-day QA cycles. QA Wolf [5]
covers 80% of your web and mobile app with automated tests in just
four months, then maintains and updates them 24/7.

Unlimited parallel test runs [6] validate every change in minutes, not
days. The zero flakes guarantee [7] cuts out false alarms and wasted
engineering hours.

Salesloft saves $750k a year [8]running over 300 tests on each PR—a
clear example of how QA Wolf transforms QA speed and efficiency.

Spend less time stressing over slow test suites and more time
delivering what your customers need.

Take your releases from bottlenecked to blazing-fast.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PICKING A STATE MANAGEMENT LIBRARY FOR A REACT APP USED BY MILLIONS
(AND WHY WE WENT WITH MOBX) (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Photoroom's web app team transitioned from extensive use of
useContext to MobX to address performance issues and prepare for
real-time editing. The migration started with a proof of concept and
was supported by thorough documentation and workshops. It greatly
improved testing, state management, and developer productivity in the
company. 

 SO YOU WANNA WRITE KUBERNETES CONTROLLERS? (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This blog post discusses common pitfalls in Kubernetes controller
development. Important aspects include designing CRDs following
Kubernetes API conventions, building single-responsibility
controllers, and implementing a well-structured `Reconcile()` method.
Developers also need to understand cached clients, handle
reconciliation return values correctly, and use the expectations
pattern to account for asynchronous updates and stale data in the
cache. 

 THE HIDDEN COMPLEXITY OF SCALING WEBSOCKETS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Scaling WebSockets for real-time apps presents unexpected
complexities, especially regarding graceful deployments and
maintaining persistent connections. Ways to address some of the issues
with WebSockets include having a deployment strategy that minimizes
downtime by using phased server removal and client-side reconnection
logic with exponential backoff. Heartbeat mechanisms can also be used
to detect silent disconnects. Finally, a server-sent events (SSE)
fallback guarantees reliable communication even on restrictive
networks.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 LIFE LESSONS FROM THE FIRST HALF-CENTURY OF MY CAREER (19 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 David Patterson, a UC Berkeley professor and Google Distinguished
Engineer, offers 16 life lessons categorized as people-focused and
career-focused. He emphasizes prioritizing family and happiness,
highlighting the importance of strong relationships and finding joy in
work. Patterson also stresses the value of honest feedback, courageous
action, and surrounding oneself with positive influences. 

 AI IS CREATING A GENERATION OF ILLITERATE PROGRAMMERS (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 An over-reliance on AI for coding has diminished this developer's
problem-solving skills while coding. He stopped reading documentation
and debugging independently, becoming overly dependent on AI for
instant solutions, leading to a decline in his abilities and a loss of
the satisfaction from solving problems independently. To combat this,
he implemented "No-AI Days” while working. 

 YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED QUERY BUILDERS (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The author argues against using query builders in favor of writing
SQL directly, claiming that query builders often lead to complex and
error-prone code. They show how SQL's built-in capabilities, like
handling `NULL` values and conditional logic, can make query
construction easier for common scenarios such as filtering based on
optional parameters and pagination.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ORANGE INTELLIGENCE (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Orange Intelligence is an open-source, customizable macOS
productivity tool that uses a floating window to capture, process (via
Python functions and LLMs), and replace text across applications. It
offers a more flexible alternative to Apple's built-in intelligence
features. 

 FORTUNESHEET (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 FortuneSheet is a JavaScript spreadsheet library written in
TypeScript that offers Excel-like features designed for ease of use
and maintainability.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE LEADING AI MODELS ARE NOW VERY GOOD HISTORIANS (17 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Advanced AI models like GPT-4, o1, and Claude are showing
surprisingly strong historical research capabilities, exceeding
expectations in transcription, translation, and analysis of historical
texts and images. This post provides case studies that showcase these
models' abilities to accurately transcribe and translate early modern
Italian, analyze obscure 18th-century medical texts, and even generate
novel historical interpretations comparable to a first-year PhD
student's work. 

 AI SLOP, SUSPICION, AND WRITING BACK (8 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The increasing prevalence of AI-generated content ("slop") is slowly
eroding trust online. Instead of directly publishing AI-generated text
without significant editing, it's better to use it for augmentation,
as a tool, while writing. Writers can actively shape the future of AI
by producing high-quality, distinctive content that influences future
AI training datasets.

 'FIRST AI SOFTWARE ENGINEER' IS BAD AT ITS JOB (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Devin, an AI software engineer tool, was tested by independent
researchers - it successfully completed only 15 percent of assigned
tasks. 

 THE MICROSOFT 365 COPILOT LAUNCH WAS A TOTAL DISASTER (9 MINUTE READ)
[21] 

 Microsoft's rollout of Microsoft 365 Copilot was poorly received due
to a significant unannounced price increase, poorly implemented AI
features, and a bungled announcement process.

 WHEN JOB HOPPING DOESN'T MAKE SENSE (4 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 While job hopping can accelerate early-career advancement, it can
slow later-career growth by disrupting the accumulation of influence
and domain expertise needed for higher-level promotions.
