 NETLIFY'S FRAMEWORK-AGNOSTIC PRIMITIVES LET YOU TURN STATIC PAGES
INTO DYNAMIC EXPERIENCES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Selecting the right frontend framework can be daunting and lock-in
goes against the original open vision for the web [5].

Netlify's platform-level primitives give you back freedom of choice by
unlocking never-before-accessible functionalities [4] ‚Äî regardless
of whether you're building with Next.js, Astro, Nuxt, Remix, or
another framework of your choice. Full flexibility, no framework
lock-in [4].

With Platform Primitives, you can use advanced cache control to
replace stale and static pages with truly high-performance digital
experiences [4]. Transform images on demand, store and retrieve blobs,
or create dynamic experiences with SWR and Fine Grained Cache Control.

See how Platform Primitives work [4] (or read the blog [5]).

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 LEAVING RUST GAMEDEV AFTER 3 YEARS (96 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This is a long collection of thoughts and problems that two indie
developers faced when trying to use Rust for game development after
completing development of several games written in Rust. They conclude
that Rust presents fundamental challenges to game development, even
after one becomes experienced with it. For example, Rust's borrow
checker often requires code restructuring for even basic tasks,
leading to a frustrating development experience. Also, Rust's focus on
refactoring and correctness can lead to over-engineered solutions that
prioritize code purity over being able to ship the game to a playable
state quickly. 

 HANDLING THE INDENTATION OF A TREEVIEW COMPONENT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Different tools tackle the UI challenge of indenting nested treeview
components with varying solutions. GitHub uses CSS Grid and calculated
spacer widths for a clean, adaptable layout. Figma uses
JavaScript-driven spacer management, which works well but is much more
complex. Adobe uses either padding adjustments (Photoshop) or
pseudo-elements (Spectrum) for visual depth. 

 HOW MOUSE DATA REVEALS USER SECRETS (AND HOW TO USE IT) (17 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Mouse clicks, scrolls, and movements leave a data trail that reveals
user behavior. Machine learning can analyze this data to predict what
users will do next or who they are. This can be used to personalize
experiences and improve security, but factors like the type of mouse
can affect accuracy.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 A USEFUL PRODUCTIVITY MEASURE (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Measuring software engineering productivity is notoriously tough, so
this author, a VP of Engineering, tracks indicators related to
building an ideal engineering organization, like profitability. One
useful profitability indicator is 'value-add capacity', the percentage
of engineering time spent adding value for customers. 

 PRACTICAL LEARNING STRATEGIES FOR ENGINEERS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Engineers who want to learn more effectively should be intentional
about it. They should plan focused reading time, minimize
distractions, and take notes while reading. This article covers
memorization techniques like the Link Method and Memory Palace to help
understand connections between concepts better.

 INVERSION - MENTAL MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Inversion is a mental model where you invert a problem to gain a
different perspective on how to solve it. For example, instead of
focusing on how to make your team happy, you think about how to make
them miserable. This helps you identify your current shortcomings and
make better future decisions that affect them. 

 THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE JOINING AN ACCELERATOR ‚Äî INSTEAD THEY LOST
THEIR STARTUPS (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Newchip, a startup accelerator, promised introductions to investors
and other resources, but instead filed for bankruptcy, leaving over a
thousand startups in jeopardy. The warrants Newchip held in these
startups are now being auctioned off by the bankruptcy court. Some
founders have lost their companies as a result, since now their cap
tables have unknown investors.
