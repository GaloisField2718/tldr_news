 REACT TRICKS: FAST, FIT AND FUN (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article discusses React tricks learned from maintaining the
open-source React library ‚ÄúWouter‚Äù. Some tricks mentioned include
using React.cloneElement for component composition, optimizing
component rendering with React.memo, using useState for resource
initialization, and stable callbacks with useEvent. The article also
touches on managing external state changes with useSyncExternalStore
and addressing tearing issues with hashchange events in React.

framework, Vercel's success with its AI SDK, the growth of Cloud

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 4 SIMPLE PROGRAMMING HABITS THAT TRANSFORMED MY PRODUCTIVITY (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Leave work slightly unfinished in order to reach a productive ‚Äúflow
state‚Äù easier the next day. Learn keyboard and mouse shortcuts,

priorities 

 MENTORING SOFTWARE ENGINEERS OR ENGINEERING LEADERS (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Mentoring is valuable for professional growth. A few different
approaches to finding mentors include seeking internal mentors at
large companies, considering paid coaches for engineering leaders at
smaller companies, and connecting with experienced individuals both
in-person and online. Mentoring doesn't have to be formal and
structured, as even informal mentorship can be valuable and initiated
by simply asking someone you admire for their time and advice.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SWIFT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE PART OF THE OS (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Swift's inclusion in Apple's operating systems has benefits such as
not requiring apps to embed Swift libraries. However, it also creates
challenges such as the inability to remove or change APIs without
affecting existing apps. Alternatives to Apple‚Äôs approach, such as
library deduplication, explicit "polyfill" support, and explicit
backwards-deployment support, improve the developer experience and
help manage the evolution of Swift in the OS. 

 THE LARGEST MONEY-PRINTING UI ELEMENT EVER MADE (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A browser‚Äôs URL/search bar is an expensive piece of real estate.
Google pays Firefox approximately $400 million and Safari receives
between $15-20 billion for Google to be the default search engine.
This article floats the idea that creating a popular browser and
selling the default search preference could be a viable business
strategy given the lucrative nature of the browser's URL/search bar.
