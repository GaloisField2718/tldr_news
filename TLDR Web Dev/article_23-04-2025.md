 FASTER LAZY LOADING IN REACT ROUTER V7.5+ (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 React Router v7.5 introduces a new granular lazy loading API for
routes in Data Mode that allows individual route properties—like
loader, Component, and middleware—to be lazy-loaded separately. This
change was driven by the need to support middleware without degrading
performance. Unlike the previous route.lazy() function that loaded
everything at once, the new approach allows for faster, more efficient
loading by only fetching what's needed at each navigation step. 

 ABUSING DUCKDB-WASM BY MAKING SQL DRAW 3D GRAPHICS (SORT OF) (14
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This developer created a text-based 3D Doom clone in the browser
using DuckDB-WASM to handle game state and rendering with SQL queries.
The core of the rendering engine is a SQL VIEW that performs
raycasting via recursive CTEs, with JavaScript handling orchestration,
sprite rendering, and Z-buffering. There were some challenges along
the way with WASM initialization, SQL dialect differences, query
planner limitations, and race conditions, all of which the dev
overcame with some creativity. 

 SCALE YOUR PROJECT WITH LAYERED REACT STRUCTURE (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Layered React Structure (LRS) is a method for organizing React
projects for better clarity, modularity, and scalability. Unlike
Angular's opinionated structure, React doesn't have a formal style
guide, which often leads to inconsistent project layouts. LRS solves
this by separating concerns into clearly defined layers: “smart”
components (business logic) and “dumb” components (UI only), along
with organized folders for views, components, hooks, services, utils,
and types.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE 13 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING LAWS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post goes over 13 software engineering laws relevant to
engineers and managers using comics and explanations. Each law is
presented with its potential impact on engineering management. The
laws range from well-known principles like Parkinson's Law (work
expands to fill the time available for its completion) to lesser-known
ones such as Zawinski's Law (every program attempts to expand until it
can read mail - those programs which cannot expand are replaced by
ones which can). 

 CODING AS CRAFT: GOING BACK TO THE OLD GYM (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When stuck on a problem during coding, devs should return to the "old
gym" occasionally, where they grapple directly with problems rather
than just handing them to AI first. While AI is great for automating
mundane tasks like boilerplate generation and documentation, it has
the potential to also overtake one's core skills of thinking,
designing, and making architectural decisions.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SAPPHIRE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Sapphire is a Rust-powered package manager for macOS inspired by
Homebrew. It manages command-line tools (Formulae) and desktop
applications (Casks). The project is structured into a core library
for handling package management tasks and a command-line interface for
user interaction. 

 CLICKHOUSE GETS LAZIER (AND FASTER): INTRODUCING LAZY MATERIALIZATION
(24 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ClickHouse, a fast analytical database, has introduced a new
optimization called "lazy materialization" to improve query
performance. This technique delays reading column data until it's
absolutely necessary, especially benefiting Top N queries with large
datasets and LIMIT clauses. An example of lazy materialization showed
a query being sped up from 219 seconds to 139 milliseconds without SQL
changes. 

 ROWBOAT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Rowboat is an AI-powered platform that lets users quickly build
multi-agent workflows. Users can define a task and then Rowboat
automatically generates the necessary agents and tools. It can be
integrated into applications using either an HTTP API or a Python SDK.

 HOW TO BUILD AN AGENT (30 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article shows how to create an AI agent using Go and Anthropic's
Claude API in about 400 lines of code. The agent is able to use tools
to read, list, and edit files through structured function calls. 

 GOOGLE WON'T DITCH THIRD-PARTY COOKIES IN CHROME AFTER ALL (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Google has abandoned its plans to phase out third-party cookies in
Chrome and will not roll out a one-click prompt to disable them. The
company's Privacy Sandbox initiative, which was supposed to develop a
privacy-preserving alternative to cookies for targeted advertising,
has essentially been called off. This decision comes after Google
struggled to find a universally acceptable solution and has faced
increasing antitrust scrutiny regarding its dominance in the ads
industry.
