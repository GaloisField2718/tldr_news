 NEED TO BUILD INTEGRATIONS WITH YOUR USERS' OTHER SAAS APPS?
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 You'll need to spend weeks researching dozens of 3rd party APIs,
manage OAuth for each integration, spin up webhook listeners, handle
app-specific rate limits, and much more.

That's why 29% of engineering teams at SaaS companies use an Embedded
iPaaS like Paragon [4], so their engineers can stay focused on their
core competencies - not integrations.

While most companies are still building in-house, many engineering
teams are entering build vs. buy [4]comparisons.

Check out this Build vs. Buy: Native Integrations [4]guide for
engineering teams.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 ENGINEERING FOR SLOW INTERNET (26 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Minor issues in app development and speed can become significant
problems in areas with slow Internet. While developers shouldn't be
expected to spend excessive time on extreme cases, it's important to
acknowledge elements of websites that may perform worse with slower
internet. Apps should be resilient enough to handle basic tasks like
transmitting text without getting stuck due to hardcoded timeouts. 

 MY VERY FIRST PRODUCTION BUG (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A developer working on an autonomous driving system encountered an
issue where a new, faster camera made the tracking system worse. The
root cause was a preprocessor directive for the framerate, which was
mistakenly defined as an integer and not a floating-point number due
to a missing decimal point. This caused the sampling time to be
calculated as zero, leading to incorrect position predictions by the
Kalman filter. 

 SOMETIMES, OBJECT PROPERTY ORDER MATTERS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Since version 4.7, the order of properties in an object in TypeScript
can affect type inference. This change was introduced to address bugs
related to context-sensitive functions, but it can lead to unexpected
errors when properties are reordered.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THREE LAWS OF SOFTWARE COMPLEXITY (OR: WHY SOFTWARE ENGINEERS ARE
ALWAYS GRUMPY) (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are three fundamental laws of software complexity: systems
inevitably degrade in design quality over time, successful systems
create complexity through leaky abstractions to gain market share, and
there is no upper limit to the complexity a system can reach. Most
engineers end up working on poorly designed systems, which only grow
more intricate and challenging to work on over time. 

 CLEVER CODE IS PROBABLY THE WORST CODE YOU COULD WRITE (8 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Clear, readable code is more valuable than clever code in the long
run. This developer's experience at a large tech company revealed that
even though clear code might seem trivial, it's actually more
difficult to write and maintain. In order to ‚Äúpreserve complexity‚Äù
for promotion packets, documentation was important for demonstrating
the complexity of the work. 

 SELF-SERVE DASHBOARDS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Self-serve BI dashboards don't work because they assume that the main
barrier for business stakeholders is writing SQL queries, while the
real issue is the lack of context and understanding of the data.

appearance and in-app screenshot editing. 

 UNFORGET (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Unforget is a minimalist, offline-first, and end-to-end encrypted
note-taking app with desktop, mobile, and web support. It's
open-source and has public APIs for creating your own client or
syncing across devices.

 ClipBook is a free clipboard history app for macOS.

 GENERATIVE AI IS NOT GOING TO BUILD YOUR ENGINEERING TEAM FOR YOU (27
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 While generative AI can help in producing code fast, it's not a
substitute for the experience and mentorship required to develop
junior engineers into seniors and beyond. The industry will face a
bottleneck in the future if it believes that AI can simply replace
junior engineers (which it can't). 

 THE COST OF SHUTTING DOWN THE INTERNET (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A recent survey examined the economic impact of internet outages on
countries and businesses and found that the United States and Amazon
would face the highest financial losses in such a scenario. The U.S.
would incur a $11 billion loss in a 24-hour outage, while Amazon would
suffer a $1.5 billion loss in the same period.
