 HOW WE SHRUNK OUR JAVASCRIPT MONOREPO GIT SIZE BY 94% (7 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 A Microsoft team working with a massive JavaScript monorepo (1JS)
faced a challenge: the repository size had ballooned to 178GB. The
issue stemmed from two key problems: keeping thousands of files in a
single folder and a flawed packing algorithm that led to inefficient
compression of files with similar names, especially CHANGELOG files.
To address the folder issue, the team implemented a pull request and
automated cleanup pipelines. The packing issue was tackled by
repacking the repo with a larger window and utilizing a new path-walk
algorithm, resulting in a reduction from 178GB to 5GB. 

 UNDERSTANDING ROUND ROBIN DNS (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Round Robin DNS is a method of load balancing by distributing traffic
across multiple servers. Browsers like Safari select the closest
server based on latency, while Cloudflare consistently picks a random
server regardless of its proximity or availability. 

 DELICIOUS DONUT COMPONENTS (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Component composition in React Server Components (RSC) allows for
creating flexible UIs and avoiding prop drilling. While composition
works similarly in both client and server components, there are
important distinctions when interleaving them. This article discusses
these differences, including limitations on function passing and the
use of `React.cloneElement()`, and provides alternative strategies for
sharing state across server and client boundaries.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WRITES AND WRITE-NOTS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The widespread use of AI will create a division between "writes" and
"write-nots," with the former being those who can still write and the
latter those who rely on AI for writing. This shift will result in a
decline in the ability to think clearly, as writing is an essential
tool for developing and expressing thought. 

 MASTERING CODE SIMPLICITY: WHY DEEP FUNCTIONS LIKE JSON.PARSE() MAKE
PROGRAMMING EASIER (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 “Deep functions” are well-designed functions that simplify
complex tasks by hiding complexity. JSON.parse() is a prime example:
its simple interface masks its complex internal workings, while still
being predictable to use and call externally. 

 HOW NOT TO DISAGREE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When a team leader disagrees with a managerial decision, they should
not oppose it publicly but instead commit to executing it effectively.
By doing so, they avoid creating a victim mentality within the team
and preserve their credibility.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MDX (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Mdx is a command-line tool that allows you to execute code blocks
within Markdown files. It provides features like argument passing,
dependency definition, and shebang support. 

 AGENT.EXE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Agent.exe is an Electron app that lets Claude 3.5 Sonnet control your
local computer directly. 

 BETTER UPLOAD (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Better Upload is a React library that simplifies file uploads to
S3-compatible services. It offers a streamlined setup, customizable
server-side logic, and pre-built UI components.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BEFORE YOU BUY A DOMAIN NAME, FIRST CHECK TO SEE IF IT'S HAUNTED (8
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This developer bought a domain name, musicbox.fun, unaware that it
had a history of copyright violations. This past activity negatively
impacted the domain's reputation with search engines, causing the
developer's website traffic to plummet. Before buying a domain, check
for such “haunted” domains by using the Wayback Machine, searching
for DMCA complaints, and examining historical SEO data. 

 DETECTING WHEN LLMS ARE UNCERTAIN (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Reasoning in LLMs can be improved by utilizing adaptive sampling
techniques that take into account the model's uncertainty. A project
called Entropix measures uncertainty using entropy and varentropy,
which quantify the distribution of the predicted tokens. It then uses
different sampling methods based on these metrics, including argmax
sampling for high confidence, branching for multiple possibilities,
and inserting "thinking" tokens for low confidence. 

 OUR OPTIMIZERS NEED A RETHINK (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Compiler and database optimizers may need a significant rethink to
improve their understandability, controllability, and testability.
Current shortcomings of optimizers include limited user control,
difficulty in debugging optimization misses, and lack of proper
testing capabilities. These can be solved by providing clearer
documentation, developing improved tooling for debugging optimization
failures, allowing users to provide explicit guidance to the
optimizer, and creating regression testing infrastructure.

 NOTES ON THE NEW CLAUDE ANALYSIS JAVASCRIPT CODE EXECUTION TOOL (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic's Claude now features a JavaScript-based code execution
tool, "the analysis tool," which runs directly in the user's browser
and allows Claude to solve problems by writing and executing code. 

 USING SQLITE AS STORAGE FOR WEB SERVER STATIC CONTENT (4 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Clace, a platform for internal tool development, uses SQLite as a
file storage system for its web applications, taking advantage of its
transactional updates, file de-duplication, easy backups, and content
hashing features.

(9 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This company created test suites in minutes using LLMs with precise
prompts and code examples.
