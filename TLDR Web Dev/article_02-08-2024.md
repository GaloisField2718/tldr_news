 HOW GOOGLE HANDLES JAVASCRIPT THROUGHOUT THE INDEXING PROCESS (17
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 There are common myths about how Google handles JavaScript during the
indexing process. Through a study involving over 100,000 Googlebot
fetches, researchers found that Google can render and index JavaScript
content, including complex SPAs, dynamically loaded content, and
streamed content. The study also debunked the myth of a significant
rendering queue, showing that most pages are rendered within minutes,
not days or weeks. As a result, people should feel free to use JS
frameworks in their websites while still making sure that pages load
fast. 

 DISSECTING PARTIAL PRE RENDERING (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR) in Next.js combines the best of static
site generation, server-side rendering, and client-side rendering. By
pre-rendering static portions of a page at build time and streaming
dynamic content at request time, PPR is able to have fast initial page
loads, personalized content, and interactivity in a single HTTP
request. This article goes into how PPR works. 

 BUILDING A MULTI-PLATFORM ON-CALL MOBILE APP (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Incident.io chose React Native for its on-call mobile app because it
could provide a native feel, a single codebase for iOS and Android,
and code familiarity for its team. The team initially used Expo Go for
rapid development and iteration during a hackathon, then transitioned
to the "managed workflow" setup for production, using Expo's build
services and implementing native features through Expo's "modules"
system.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AFTER A DECADE OF REACT, IS FRONTEND A POST-REACT WORLD NOW? (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 React introduced the concept of a "virtual DOM" to optimize web app
rendering. Its popularity led to widespread adoption, but also to
criticisms regarding its learning curve, state management, and
performance. While React's defenders highlight its improvements in
recent versions, alternative frameworks like Svelte and Astro offer
simpler approaches without relying on the virtual DOM. 

 DON'T ASK PERMISSION TO DO YOUR JOB CORRECTLY: AVOIDING THE TECHNICAL
DEBT TRAP (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Technical debt, often confused with cruft, is intentionally
simplified code with a plan to address it and business alignment.
Cruft is unintentional and lacks a plan. To avoid the technical debt
trap, developers should prioritize clean code practices and
communicate effectively with management to make sure technical debt is
understood and addressed eventually.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WRITE BUG REPORTS DEVELOPERS LOVE (WEBSITE) [9] 

 A checklist to write bug reports that developers love. It discusses
what to put in the bug report and how to write it. Some important
points include: titles should be short and specific, steps to
reproduce the bug should be easy to follow, and screenshots should be
added if possible. 

 GITOPPER (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Gitopper enables a GitOps workflow for non-Kubernetes environments by

 THREAT ACTOR ABUSES CLOUDFLARE TUNNELS TO DELIVER RATS (7 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Proofpoint observed an increase in malware delivery through the abuse
of Cloudflare Tunnels, particularly with the TryCloudflare feature.
The campaign delivers remote access trojans (RATs) and has been
evolving to bypass detection. It involves sending malicious emails
with URLs or attachments, leading to the download and installation of
malware like Xworm, AsyncRAT, VenomRAT, GuLoader, and Remcos. 

 THE TROUBLE WITH __ALL__ (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Python's `__all__` attribute is meant to define a module's public
API, but it doesn't enforce it, allowing access to private elements.
This can lead to tightly coupled modules and broken domain boundaries,
especially in large projects. A custom `ModuleWrapper` class can
enforce `__all__` but has downsides like runtime impact and limited
scope.
