80% test coverage in just 4 months.
They‚Äôll build and maintain your test suite in Playwright (no vendor
lock-in, you own the code) + include unlimited parallel test runs on
their infrastructure. And they guarantee zero flakes [5].

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW META BUILT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THREADS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article details how Meta's infrastructure teams successfully
supported Threads' rapid growth, hitting 100 million users in 5 days.
The article highlights the roles of ZippyDB, a scalable distributed
key/value database, and Async, a serverless function platform, in
managing the high user influx and workload demands. These components
demonstrate Meta's robust infrastructure and engineering culture,
enabling fast product launches. 

 WHAT VUE‚ÄôS CREATOR LEARNED THE HARD WAY WITH VUE 3 (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Evan You, creator of Vue, recounts some of the challenges the release
of Vue 3 unveiled and the lessons he learned with each one. One key
lesson was minimizing breaking changes and adopting a deprecation
cycle to ensure smoother transitions for users. Another lesson was
recognizing the importance of collaborating with ecosystem library
authors to address issues before releases and discouraging the use of
internal APIs to prevent difficulties in upgrading. Embracing
TypeScript and the composition API was crucial for a better developer
experience. 

 WHAT IS A DISTRIBUTED DATABASE AND WHEN SHOULD YOU USE ONE? (7 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Distributed databases are recommended when you need geographical
distribution of data, scalability, high availability and data
resilience, and routing traffic for lower latency. However,
distributed databases also come with challenges such as efficient
routing, maintaining data consistency, handling complex ACID
transactions, cost considerations, and provisioning.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE DAY I STARTED BELIEVING IN UNIT TESTS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Initially skeptical about the value of unit tests, the author was
assigned to create and run them for embedded software. After a year of
successful runs, the tests suddenly started failing due to a race
condition in the test framework's threading abstraction. This
experience led the author to recognize the importance of unit tests in
uncovering hidden defects, improving code quality, and adopting new
development methodologies when necessary. 

 BIGGEST PRODUCTIVITY KILLERS IN THE ENGINEERING INDUSTRY (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The top productivity killers include external distractions such as

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TSDOCS (WEBSITE) [11] 

 TSDocs is a platform that allows you to browse type reference
documentation for JavaScript packages. It even works for packages that
aren‚Äôt written in TypeScript or for packages that re-export types
from another package. 

 RE:DOM (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 RE:DOM is a small UI library built to create DOM elements and keep
them in sync with live data. It doesn‚Äôt use the virtual DOM and
therefore uses less memory than other virtual DOM-based libraries.
Developers can use pure JavaScript if needed, eliminating the need for
complex templating languages. 

 KANBAN-PYTHON (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Kanban-python is a terminal Kanban board built in Python with the
help of pyscaffold. It comes with features like custom column
creation, automatic scanning, and a customizable config file, all
