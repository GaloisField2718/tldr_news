ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PARTIAL KEYFRAMES (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Partial Keyframes is a CSS animation technique where you omit either
the `from` or `to` blocks in keyframe animations, which allows them to
inherit starting or ending values from the element's current state
instead of using hardcoded values. This makes animations dynamic and
composable for effects like fading elements to their natural opacity
or animating to values set by other concurrent animations. 

 SHOPIFY TECH STACK (18 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Shopify's tech stack handles massive scale using Ruby on Rails,
React, MySQL, and Kafka. It uses a modular monolith architecture with
independently deployable components and strict interface contracts for
maintainability. Shopify's infrastructure includes Kubernetes, Kafka
for event streaming, and a focus on observability, reliability, and
security. 

 FREQUENT REAUTH DOESN'T MAKE YOU MORE SECURE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Frequent re-authentication doesn't make security better and can
actually weaken it by causing user fatigue and encouraging bad
security habits. Instead of relying on constant logins, security
should focus on continuous, real-time risk assessment and policy
enforcement.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 USESTATE SHOULD REQUIRE A DEPENDENCY ARRAY (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 React's `useState` hook should require a dependency array to prevent
a common bug where state initialized from props doesn't update when
those props change, creating un-reactive code. Current workarounds
like using the `key` prop or `useEffect` to sync state are clunky and
error-prone, and instead `useState` should work like
`useState(initialValue, [dependencies])` where state resets when
dependencies change. 

 FIRST THOUGHTS ON O3 PRO (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI's new o3-pro model has better reasoning and integration
capabilities. However, to really shine, it needs proper context. When
using it, it's best to take extra time to preseed with as much context
as possible in order for the best results. 

 FAANG VS STARTUPS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A short stint at a FAANG company provides instant credibility for new
graduates, opening future opportunities. Spending 2-3 years teaches
corporate navigation and large project management, but can lower
ambition. Longer than four years in Big Tech can permanently alter
one's risk appetite.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REACT NATIVE 0.80 - REACT 19.1, JS API CHANGES, FREEZING LEGACY ARCH,
AND MUCH MORE (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 React Native 0.80 has been released, with React 19.1, stability
improvements to the JavaScript API, and the freezing of the Legacy
Architecture. Deep imports are being deprecated, and a new Strict
TypeScript API is available for opt-in use. This release includes
experimental prebuilt iOS dependencies for faster build times, as well
as smaller APK sizes for Android apps. 

 MCWIG (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 McWig is a Vim-like text editor written in Go that supports features
like LSP autocomplete, Tree-sitter, and color themes. It only supports
Go files for now. 

 CHATTERBOX (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Chatterbox is Resemble AI's production-grade, open-source
text-to-speech (TTS) model. It has state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS,
emotion exaggeration control, and alignment-informed inference, and is
trained on 0.5M hours of cleaned data. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 JEMALLOC POSTMORTEM (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 jemalloc is a memory allocator that has been maintained for about 20
years. It is now no longer being maintained. The postmortem describes
jemalloc's evolution through phases at FreeBSD, Firefox, and
Facebook/Meta, highlighting successes like improved performance and
telemetry, as well as failures such as fragmentation issues and the
controversial removal of Valgrind support. 

 RENDERING CRISPY TEXT ON THE GPU (26 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Text can be rendered on the GPU in real time. This method involves
loading glyph data, rasterizing it at runtime to an atlas, and caching
glyphs for reuse, allowing for high-quality, subpixel anti-aliasing.

QUICK LINKS

 APPLE TODAY TOOK A SHOT AT REACT NATIVE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apple claims that developers will end up writing more code trying to
adapt to different platform conventions compared to native apps while
still sacrificing performance. 

 WHEN GOOGLE SNEEZES, THE WHOLE WORLD CATCHES A COLD (8 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 A Google Cloud IAM failure caused a widespread outage affecting
Cloudflare, Anthropic, and other large companies. 

 WHY GO IS A GOOD FIT FOR AGENTS (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Go's concurrency model, channels, centralized cancellation, standard
library, and profiling tools make it a good fit for building agents. 

 I DON'T WANT TO PAY A SUBSCRIPTION TO PROGRAM (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The need to pay subscription fees for AI coding tools may become
essential for fast software engineering.
