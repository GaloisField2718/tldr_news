ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WE HACKED GOOGLE'S AI, GEMINI AND LEAKED ITS SOURCE CODE (AT LEAST
SOME PART) (21 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In March, Roni Carta (Lupin) and team disclosed they hacked Google's
AI, Gemini, during the 2024 LLM bugSWAT event, winning the Most
Valuable Hacker award. They discovered a vulnerability within Gemini's
Python sandbox that allowed them to rewrite Python code and map the
filesystem, enabling them to extract a 579MB binary file. Analyzing
this binary revealed internal source code, including sensitive Google
proto files containing metadata descriptions used to classify user
data and internal security proto definitions. 

 COMPONENTS ARE JUST SPARKLING HOOKS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Components and hooks are closely related in React. Components are a
subtype of hooks since they inherit the Rules of Hooks and must return
a ReactNode. By converting a component into a hook, there is more
flexibility in managing state and behaviors separately from UI
rendering, allowing for patterns like headless components. 

 POSTMORTEM ON NEXT.JS MIDDLEWARE BYPASS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Vercel has published a postmortem on CVE-2025-29927, a critical
vulnerability in Next.js related to Middleware bypass. The timeline
outlines the vulnerability's disclosure, investigation, patching, and
public announcement. The vulnerability involved an internal
`x-middleware-subrequest` header and impacted self-hosted Next.js
applications, but not Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Workers.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 KARPATHY'S ‘VIBE CODING' MOVEMENT CONSIDERED HARMFUL (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Andrej Karpathy's "vibe coding" advocates relying on AI tools without
fully understanding the generated code. However, this approach leads
to technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and a loss of
intellectual ownership over systems. It's better to have a balanced
approach of using AI assistance while maintaining engineering quality
through architectural vision, focused code generation, thorough
review, and comprehensive testing. 

 THE WAY WE'RE THINKING ABOUT BREAKING CHANGES IS REALLY SILLY (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Compilers currently lack the concept of time, treating code as if it
always existed in its current state, which leads to unnecessary
breaking changes when dependencies are updated. Instead, we should
focus on preserving the behavior of existing code rather than strictly
following the old syntax during updates. This means having automatic
code migrations, similar to database migrations, that apply
transformations to call sites when dependencies are updated. 

 HOW TO WRITE BLOG POSTS THAT DEVELOPERS READ (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Good blog posts for devs get straight to the point, expand the target
audience, strategically plan how readers will discover the post, use
visuals, and accommodate skimmers to maximize engagement.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 JSON-EDIT-REACT (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Json-edit-react is a highly configurable React component for editing
and viewing JSON/object data, with features like inline editing,
granular control over edits, JSON Schema validation, customizable UI,
and search/filtering. The component is self-contained with no external
UI library dependencies and supports custom components, localization,
drag-n-drop reordering, and keyboard customization. 

 PG-MCP (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 PG-MCP is a PostgreSQL Model Context Protocol server for better AI
agent interaction with databases. It extends the reference Postgres
MCP implementation with features like multi-database support, rich
catalog information, extension context, and query explanation. The
server has connection management and query tools, along with schema
discovery and data access resources.

 WHY APPLE'S SEVERANCE GETS EDITED OVER REMOTE DESKTOP SOFTWARE (11
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple's promotional video for "Severance" inadvertently revealed a
flawed workflow for professional video editors. The video showed
editors using Macs for remote editing via Jump Desktop, a
screen-sharing tool. This means that the Mac's local horsepower is not
as important as a fast internet connection and a powerful remote
server. 

 THE STATE OF THE FRONT-END AND FULL-STACK JOB MARKET (11 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 React and Next.js are highly sought after, along with Javascript and
Typescript. AWS is the dominant cloud provider and PostgreSQL remains
a popular database. Despite some technologies correlating with higher
compensation, there are minimal salary increases with experience.
Education beyond a bachelor's degree is rarely required. 

 EVERYONE KNOWS ALL THE APPS ON YOUR PHONE (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Indian Android apps have privacy issues as many apps circumvent
Google's privacy policies to collect data on installed apps. Swiggy
and Zepto were found to have extensive lists of apps they query, while
personal loan apps like KreditBee and Moneyview query an excessive
number of apps. A significant privacy loophole exists through the
"ACTION_MAIN" filter, allowing apps to see all installed apps with a
user interface. Zepto's READ_SMS permission request shows how apps
access personal data, potentially sharing it with brokers and
affecting user pricing.

QUICK LINKS

 WHAT TO DO (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Creating valuable and original things is necessary, as it's uniquely
human to be able to think deeply and clearly, which results in the
best products, ideas, companies, and art made. 

 MALWARE IN LISP? NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING CRUEL (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Malware authors are increasingly using less common programming
languages like Delphi, Haskell, and Rust, along with less popular
compilers, to evade detection by traditional static analysis methods. 

 IT'S FIVE GRAND A DAY TO MISS OUR S3 EXIT (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 37signals' upcoming exit from AWS S3 to its own Pure Storage hardware
will save millions over five years, but it will have to pay $5,000 per
day if the data migration isn't completed by June 30. 

 WHY IS THIS SITE BUILT WITH C (9 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This developer built their website with C to have fast,
dependency-free, and long-lasting static site generation using the
md4c markdown parser after being frustrated with the complexity and
maintenance burden of previous attempts using Django and Nuxt.js.
