 INTEGRATE WITH YOUR USERS' SAAS APPS 7X FASTER, IN CODE (SPONSOR) [4]


 Need to ship the integrations your customers have been asking for?
Buying an off-the-shelf solution for integrations in the past meant
choosing between low-code iPaaS solutions.

But engineers don't want to use a low-code solution that lives outside
of their SDLC --> they lack version control, code review, or
collaboration [4].
PARAGRAPH (by Paragon [5]) brings the best of both worlds - providing
the benefits of an Embedded iPaaS (managed authentication, SaaS API
connectors, workflow engine etc.) in a Typescript framework [4].

 4 SOFTWARE DESIGN PRINCIPLES I LEARNED THE HARD WAY (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 This author built a large-scale service and found certain principles
reappearing throughout the implementation. It's useful to prioritize a
single source of truth and minimize mutable state when building
something from scratch. Developers should also make sure not to
abstract things prematurely and not to overuse mocks when writing
tests for their code. 

 DEBUGGING INFINITE LOOPS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In object-oriented programs, infinite loops can happen unknowingly.
To understand and fix these issues, you should successively inline the
methods on the stack until you have a self-referencing method. This
gets to the root of the issue compared to just applying a code-level
hack.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MY FIRST PROMO REJECTION, A BLESSING IN DISGUISE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This author was rejected for their first promotion at Google after
two years in their role for not displaying enough impact. From that
rejection, they learned the importance of taking initiative and
strategically selecting projects that demonstrated impact. 

 THE TRAP OF OVER-ENGINEERING AND OVER-DESIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Developers often over-engineer and over-design software by
abstracting things excessively and focusing on hypothetical future
scalability. Instead, it's better to prioritize core functionality
first, keep the scope reasonable, and have a ‚Äúgood‚Äù solution over
a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù one. 

 DROP EVERYTHING AND REVIEW (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Software development has multiple feedback loops: the inner loop
(immediate feedback from tools), the middle loop (code reviews), and
the outer loop (deployment and system-level testing). Code review
often gets delayed, unnecessarily inflating the middle loop which
leads to slower deployment. This author advocates for code reviews to
be the top priority for teams after any urgent production issues so
that teams can keep shipping at a smooth pace.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FRANKEN/UI (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Franken UI is a collection of copy-pastable components that are
HTML-first and framework agnostic. 

 FIRECRAWL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Crawl and convert any website into LLM-ready Markdown. It can be
self-hosted and comes with Python and Node SDKs.

 DEVELOPING RAPIDLY WITH GENERATIVE AI (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Discord builds products with generative AI quickly by identifying
suitable use cases early and then prototyping with off-the-shelf LLMs.
It evaluates prompts deeply before deploying at scale. Discord leans
towards using off-the-shelf LLMs before thinking about using
self-hosted ones because it saves engineering resources. Often, if the
target problem can't be solved with GPT-4, then it probably can't be
solved yet with generative AI at all. 

 HOW SHORT CAN GIT ABBREVIATE? (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The default 7-character length of Git hashes can lead to collisions
in large repos like the Linux kernel. This article analyzes the
distribution of abbreviation lengths, finding that while most commits
can use short abbreviations, a large number require longer ones (up to
11 currently). It recommends using at least 12 characters for large
repositories and referencing full Git hashes if possible.

QUICK LINKS

 ON GENERATING IDEAS - LEADERSHIP & WORK (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 People should generate ideas independently and quietly first before
bringing them to group settings. 

 THE DANGERS OF SINGLE LINE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article describes a vulnerability within an application where a
poorly constructed regular expression allowed for multiline input,
allowing arbitrary Ruby code execution. 

 GOOD IDEAS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A list of Computer Science victories, like arrays, hashmaps,
processes, version control, GUIs, and more. 

 EFFICIENT ENGINEERING TEAMS (X POST) [19] 

 Efficient engineering teams often have a Directly Responsible
Individual for each part of their systems.
