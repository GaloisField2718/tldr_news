ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 MIGRATING BILLIONS OF RECORDS: MOVING OUR ACTIVE DNS DATABASE WHILE
IT'S IN USE (14 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Cloudflare migrated its DNS database to a new cluster. The process
involved separating DNS record data from zone data, creating a new
internal DNS Records gRPC API, and building a custom Change Data
Capture and Transfer Service (CDCTS). The CDCTS enabled near real-time
data transfer. Afterwards, Cloudflare saw an improvement in its DNS
Records API performance. 

 A NETFLIX WEB PERFORMANCE CASE STUDY (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Netflix optimized its logged-out homepage for improved
Time-to-Interactive by switching from React to vanilla JavaScript and
prefetching resources for subsequent pages. This led to a 50%
reduction in Time-to-Interactive on the homepage and a 30% reduction
for future page navigations. 

 HOW TO SPEED UP YOUR VUE APP WITH SERVER SIDE RENDERING (10 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is where the server generates HTML
content which is then sent to the browser for immediate display,
leading to faster initial load times and better SEO. This article
outlines two approaches to SSR in Vue: manual rendering, which
requires setting up a Node.js server, and using pre-built solutions
like Nuxt, Quasar, or Vite-plugin-ssr/Vike.

requirement, is necessary. 

 YOU WANT MODULES, NOT MICROSERVICES (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Microservices hype is a rehash of older architectural concepts like
