 USING S3 BUT NOT THE WAY YOU EXPECTED. S3 AS STRONGLY CONSISTENT
EVENT STORE (24 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Amazon S3 can be used as a strongly consistent event store with the
help of the new conditional writes feature. Conditional writes enable
optimistic concurrency, which is necessary for managing data updates
in distributed systems. This article provides a step-by-step guide on
how to implement this strategy. It also goes over structured naming
conventions and conflict resolution. 

 TANSTACK ROUTER SERVER FUNCTIONS (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TanStack Router's Server Functions allows developers to execute code
only on the server, keeping sensitive logic away from the client. They
are defined using `createServerFn` and can be called from anywhere in
the application, including loaders, hooks, and other server functions.
Server functions accept a single parameter and also provide access to
server request context, allowing developers to work with headers,
sessions, and cookies. 

 NOTES ON DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS FOR YOUNG BLOODS (20 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Frequent failures and partial failures are inherent in distributed
systems, requiring more robust design and the ability to take on
increased costs. In distributed systems, careful coordination requires
the help of data locality and partial availability.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GREPPABILITY IS AN UNDERRATED CODE METRIC (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Code "greppability" is when code is easy to search through thanks to
easy-to-understand names. Dynamically constructing identifiers (e.g.,
table names and function names) makes code searching harder. Use flat,
unnested structures for namespaces and components as it makes it
easier to locate specific elements through simple searches. 

 COMMENTS ON FOUNDER MODE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ken Kocienda saw Steve Jobs and Brian Chesky work up close and found
that they had few key similarities. They both had deep intuition, a
tireless work ethic, an unwavering commitment to their vision, and a
fantastic ability to effectively guide and empower their teams. At the
same time, they had differences such as Steve Jobs advocating for
leaving smart people alone, while Chesky believed that founders needed
to be more in contact with the ‚Äúlower levels‚Äù of the company. 

 THE ART OF FINISHING (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The "Project Hydra Effect‚Äù is when starting new projects feels more
rewarding than finishing existing ones, leading to a cycle of endless
beginnings and unfulfilled potential. Unfinished projects have an
allure to them because there is comfort in their potential while also
avoiding finality and criticism. However, not finishing projects leads
to missed opportunities, mental clutter, and a lack of confidence.

MISCELLANEOUS

 USING GPT-4O FOR WEB SCRAPING (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GPT-4o can be used for web scraping, though it can be pretty
expensive. This developer experimented with different approaches,
including directly asking GPT-4o to extract data, generating XPaths,
and combining both methods. While GPT-4o demonstrated impressive data
extraction capabilities, its inconsistent inaccuracies and high cost
made it tough to be sustainable. 

 DOING SUPPORT MAKES YOU A BETTER ENGINEER (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 PostHog involves product engineers in customer support to create
faster feedback loops, enhance product quality through constant small
improvements, and encourage full cycle ownership of the development
