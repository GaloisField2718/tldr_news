 ü™Ñ¬†INSTANTLY GENERATE A VISUAL UI FOR YOUR DATABASE (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Devs are there to build software. If they‚Äôre getting bogged down
with ad-hoc requests for data access, something‚Äôs gone wrong ‚Äî and
that‚Äôs why you need Basedash [5].
Simply connect your database, [5] and Basedash will use AI to generate
an interface. Voila, now anyone can work with data using admin panels,
internal CRMs, dashboards, or SQL queries [5] (the AI can write those
for you too).

Business teams gets data. Devs get their time back.

‚ÄúBy far the easiest way [5] to give customer support access to our
production database‚Äù ‚Äî Ian McHenry, Co-founder of Beyond Pricing.

Basedash is free for small teams. Start here ‚ú® [5]

 HOW WE BUILT OUR CUSTOMER DATA WAREHOUSE ALL ON POSTGRES (10 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Tembo built its customer data warehouse with only PostgreSQL using
foreign data wrappers (FDWs) and other PostgreSQL extensions to
simplify the process. It needed to pull data from various sources,
including Postgres, Prometheus, and Clerk, into a single location to
create dashboards for tracking customer usage and behavior. Instead of
introducing new tools and technologies, Tembo utilized FDWs to connect
PostgreSQL to these data sources, creating two new FDWs, clerk_fdw,
and prometheus_fdw, for Clerk and Prometheus respectively. It also
used pg_cron for scheduling updates and pg_partman for partitioning to
improve performance and automate data retention. 

 THE WEB JUST GETS BETTER WITH INTEROP 2024 (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Web interoperability makes the web accessible and consistent across
different browsers. The Interop Project aims to improve
interoperability by encouraging browser engine teams to focus on
specific areas. The focus areas for Interop 2024 include
accessibility, CSS Nesting, custom properties, and Declarative Shadow
DOM. Interop is also investigating projects aimed at improving
accessibility testing, mobile testing, and WebAssembly testing.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MY FAVOURITE GIT COMMIT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The author‚Äôs favorite Git commit is a message from their time at
the Government Digital Service while working on GOV.UK. The commit
message, titled "Convert template to US-ASCII to fix error," is valued
because it provides clear explanations for the change, is searchable,
tells a story about the problem and its resolution, and helps spread
knowledge and build trust within a team. Good commit messages are
helpful in maintaining a codebase's history and improving
collaboration among developers. 

 IT FEELS LIKE REACT IS GETTING A BIT OF A KICKING RECENTLY (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 React has faced criticism lately for becoming overly complicated
despite its wide use across the industry. When choosing a web
framework or library for a project, it‚Äôs important to consider
various factors, such as project requirements, performance needs, and
team capabilities. Instead of following social media trends,
developers should choose the best tool for the job, which is sometimes
React or sometimes something else.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 STANCHION (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Stanchion is an SQLite 3 extension that brings column-oriented
storage to SQLite. SQLite exclusively supports row-oriented tables,
but Stanchion changes that. Column-oriented storage is generally
better for analytics queries over many rows and few columns and
metric, log, event, and time-series data. 

 JOLT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Jolt is a JSON structural transformation library that is useful for
transforming JSON data from databases or extracting data from large
JSON documents for your own consumption.

 THANKSGIVING 2023 SECURITY INCIDENT (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 In November 2023, Cloudflare detected a security incident where a
threat actor gained access to its self-hosted Atlassian server.
Despite this, Cloudflare assured its customers that no customer data
or systems were affected. The incident was traced back to stolen
credentials from an Okta compromise in October, with the threat actor
conducting reconnaissance and accessing internal systems, mainly
Atlassian products. Cloudflare responded with a "Code Red" effort to
strengthen security, rotating over 5,000 production credentials,
segmenting systems, and performing forensic triages. The threat actor
was ultimately denied access. Cloudflare notes that it believes the
attack was performed by a nation-state. 

 APPLE ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO IOS, SAFARI, AND THE APP STORE IN THE
EUROPEAN UNION (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple announced big changes for iOS, Safari, and the App Store users
in the EU. For developers, the changes include new options for app
distribution and payment processing. For web developers specifically,
Apple is introducing a choice screen that will surface when users
first open Safari in iOS 17.4 or later. That screen will prompt EU
users to choose a default browser from a list of options. Apple has
also introduced alternative, opt-in-optional business terms for apps
in the EU, which include reduced commission on app transactions, a 3%
fee when using the App Store‚Äôs payment processing, and a core
technology fee of ‚Ç¨0.50 for each first annual install per year over
a 1 million threshold.

 WHY RENAMING A FILE ISN‚ÄôT THE SAME AS CONVERTING IT (2 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 When you convert a file, such as an M4A to MP3, it involves several
steps like decoding, re-encoding, and copying metadata. On the other
hand, simply renaming a file doesn't change its internal data or
format - it remains encoded in the original format. Changing a file's
extension by renaming it may result in losing metadata. 

 STARLINK'S LASER SYSTEM IS BEAMING 42 MILLION GB OF DATA PER DAY (3

tiers.
