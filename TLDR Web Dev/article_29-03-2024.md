ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVENESS OF INLINING CSS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This developer inlined their CSS and split it into critical and
non-critical sections to optimize their website‚Äôs loading speed,
leading to a 22% reduction in First Contentful Paint time. Moving
minor JavaScript logic into static HTML generation further improved
load times slightly. These optimizations ultimately increased page
views by 32% over one week. 

 THE EVOLUTION OF SOUNDCLOUD'S ARCHITECTURE: PART 1 (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 SoundCloud kept its initial technology stack simple. As the platform
grew, it made strategic choices, like adding HAProxy and RabbitMQ, to
address performance bottlenecks caused by long-running requests and
high traffic. To further optimize performance and support its growth,
SoundCloud eventually decoupled its architecture, introduced caching
and new data stores, and transitioned towards a microservices model. 

 IMPROVING INP AND FID WITH PRODUCTION PROFILING (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google introduced INP (Interaction to Next Paint) as part of its Core
Web Vitals this year. Your website's SEO ranking can be affected by
INP. INP can be reported if the UI fails to respond promptly to a
pointer or keyboard event triggered on your website. This blog post
looks at a few different methods to identify the root cause of slow
interactions, including comparing JavaScript self-profiling to other
browser APIs.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 5 NON-VERBAL BEHAVIORS KILLING TEAM HEALTH (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Non-verbal signals can significantly impact team morale and should be
addressed early. This article describes 5 common negative non-verbal
behaviors: 1. silent but irritated, 2. annoying interrupter, 3. always
confused, 4. non-appreciative, and 5. ignorer. It shares strategies
for avoiding these behaviors in yourself and offers tips on how to
respectfully manage them when displayed by others. 

 FRONTEND DEBUGGING IS BAD AND IT SHOULD FEEL BAD (12 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Frontend debugging is often a time-consuming and frustrating process
because developers lack visibility into what's happening on the user's
end. Traditional tools provide metrics, but don't always give enough
context to identify root causes of issues. A better way to debug
frontend issues is to use observability tools that capture more
contextual data about how problems occur. 

 KUBERNETES AND BACK - WHY I DON'T RUN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This author switched a side project to a Kubernetes-based
infrastructure, only to find it overly complex, expensive, and
difficult to manage. Despite the promise of high availability, the
system suffered from slow performance, difficult debugging, and
downtime during node failures. While Kubernetes can be powerful, it's
important to choose the right tools for the job and not get caught up
in complexity for its own sake if it's not necessary.

 THE STATE OF ENGINEERING PRODUCTIVITY IN 2024 (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This study of engineer productivity based on 204 survey responses
looks at how engineers and managers rank themselves in a team,
productivity offenders, and boosters and metrics that teams use to
track productivity. Some interesting takeaways are that extreme setups
(fully in-person or fully remote) score highest on personal and team
productivity, managers generally feel more productive than engineers,
and only 35% of teams track productivity despite 60% seeing it as an
opportunity. 

 LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS USE A SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE MECHANISM TO RETRIEVE
SOME STORED KNOWLEDGE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 LLMs often use simple linear functions to retrieve stored facts.
Researchers developed a technique to estimate these functions,
allowing them to probe what the model knows and where that knowledge
is stored, potentially leading to ways to correct falsehoods within
the model. 

 HOW A GROUP OF BERKELEY RESEARCHERS TOOK OVER THE CHIP INDUSTRY (20
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) for
developing chips. It is an alternative to the dominant proprietary
ISAs offered by Intel, ARM, and AMD. RISC-V has removed barriers to
entry for academia, startups, and smaller players thanks to its open
standards and free licensing. There is a strong community around
RISC-V and the success of the standard shows that commercial success
is possible without strict IP restrictions.
