ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 POSTGRES LISTEN/NOTIFY DOES NOT SCALE (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Recall.ai experienced Postgres downtime due to heavy write loads from
thousands of meeting bots. An investigation showed that Postgres'
LISTEN/NOTIFY feature acquired a global database lock during
transaction commits, serializing them and causing a bottleneck. Load
tests confirmed that removing LISTEN/NOTIFY allowed the database to
fully utilize CPU cores and handle load spikes effectively. 

 THE ACCESSIBILITY PIPELINE FOR FRONTEND TEAMS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Storybook 9's new accessibility testing pipeline integrates
accessibility checks into every stage of frontend development. Unlike
traditional accessibility testing methods that are slow and provide
low coverage, Storybook's approach tests components in isolation with
mock data, providing fast and stable feedback during development while
automatically checking for WCAG violations.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SEO IS DEAD. LONG LIVE GEO (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Traditional SEO is becoming less effective as LLMs and AI search
interfaces like Google's AI Mode rise. GEO (Generative Engine
Optimization) is a new priority that requires brands to create
detailed content answering customer questions for LLM uptake, build an
AI-friendly online presence, and monitor LLM visibility. 

 SATISFIES IN TYPESCRIPT (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The `satisfies` keyword in TypeScript allows you to assert that a
value satisfies a given type while preventing TypeScript from
inferring a wider type, which allows for excess property checking on
object literals. This is especially useful when you want to catch
typos in property names while still having idiomatic code structure.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BROWSEROS (WEBSITE) [9] 

 BrowserOS is an open-source, Chromium-based browser focused on
AI-powered automation and user privacy. It uses local AI agents and
built-in Ollama support to automate tasks, conduct research, and
curate content while keeping data secure. BrowserOS has a built-in ad
blocker and tools for productivity like a highlighter and
ChatGPT-powered bookmarker. 

 BATCH MODE IN THE GEMINI API (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Gemini API now offers a Batch Mode, an asynchronous endpoint
designed for high-throughput, non-latency-critical tasks. This new
mode allows users to submit large jobs and retrieve results within 24
hours at a 50% discount compared to synchronous APIs. Batch Mode is
great for tasks like bulk content generation and model evaluations. 

 PANGOLIN (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Pangolin is a self-hosted, tunneled reverse proxy server with
identity and access control that allows secure exposure of private
network resources without opening ports. It uses WireGuard tunnels for
secure site-to-site connectivity and offers features like automated
SSL certificates, load balancing, and integration with external
identity providers.

 THE HISTORY OF REACT THROUGH CODE (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 React started at Facebook in 2011 as "FaxJS" (later "FBolt"). Jordan
Walke created it to solve problems with the company's existing BoltJS
framework. Throughout its changes, React has maintained API
consistency, from early innovations like JSX (which allowed HTML-like
syntax in JavaScript for better performance, security, and debugging)
to modern features, all guided by a coherent design philosophy. 

 INTRODUCING REACT NATIVE RAG: LOCAL & OFFLINE RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED
GENERATION (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 React Native RAG is a new library that brings Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) capabilities to React Native apps, allowing LLMs to
generate more accurate and relevant responses by retrieving
information from a local knowledge base. The library works in two
stages: indexing documents (splitting, embedding, and storing) and
generating responses (retrieving, augmenting, and generating).
