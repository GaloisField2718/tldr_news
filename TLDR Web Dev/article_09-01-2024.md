 COMMON MISTAKES WITH THE NEXT.JS APP ROUTER AND HOW TO FIX THEM (9
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Common mistakes devs make when using the Next.js App Router include
using Route Handlers with Server Components, handling Route Handlers
incorrectly, using Suspense with Server Components, and integrating
Server and Client Components incorrectly. This article covers topics
like using context providers with App Router and revalidating data
after mutations. 

 REACT SERVER COMPONENTS: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY (15 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 React Server Components allow developers to perform server-side data
fetching and UI rendering in the same place. Some advantages of server
components include the ability to pass them as props to client
components and revalidate server HTML without losing client state.
However, there are some drawbacks, such as the complexity introduced
when handling advanced cases and the limitations in the depth of async
components. 

 THE TRUE PURPOSE OF TESTING (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The usefulness of a test is determined by whether it fulfills its
intended purpose. Tests should validate the intention behind the
system, focusing on what the code is supposed to do (the intention)
rather than how it does it (the implementation).

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE ULTIMATE GUIDE FOR MAKING THE BEST CAREER CHOICES IN TECH (14
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The "Hierarchy of Career Priorities" framework includes layers like
employability, compensation, growth, well-being, and meaning. It‚Äôs
important to stay up-to-date with technology stacks, avoid highly
specialized domain projects, and be cautious about chasing trends.
Professionals should continuously evaluate their career progression
against this hierarchy of priorities to make informed decisions. 

 THE BEST WAY TO GET UNSTUCK (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The key to becoming unstuck is to take action, even if it's something
small, as movement and momentum are crucial. One way to do this is by
temporarily shifting focus to other projects to regain confidence and
clarity. Not every situation of stuckness requires a drastic action
plan and experience is a valuable teacher in learning how to respond
appropriately. 

 3 PREDICTIONS FOR THE TECH HIRING LANDSCAPE IN 2024 (7 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Despite the rough year, there will be a strong need for software
developers, with US labor statistics predicting a 26% increase in devs
(compared to 3% for other jobs). There will be an increased demand for
both generalists and specialists, like AI developers, cybersecurity
analysts, and cloud engineers. However, the search process and hiring
will become even more selective.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 COPILOT KIT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 CopilotKit offers two main features: CopilotPortal and
CopilotTextarea. CopilotPortal enables the creation of in-app AI
chatbots that can interact with your app's frontend, backend, and
third-party services via plugins. CopilotTextarea is an AI-assisted
text generation tool that can be used as a replacement for a regular
textarea element, providing autocompletions, AI editing, and content
generation from scratch. 

 VUE-CONCURRENCY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Vue-concurrency provides an abstraction for performing async
operations in Vue. It helps reduce boilerplate code and allows new
approaches to techniques like throttling, debouncing, and polling. 

 NITRO (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Nitro is an open-source engine that enables the creation of web
servers that can run anywhere. It offers features like rapid
development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), provider-agnostic
deployments with over 15 built-in presets, code-splitting, TypeScript
support, universal storage, route caching, and more.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NEW YEAR, NEW BUG ‚Äì RIVALRY BETWEEN DEVS LED TO A DEEP-CODE
DISASTER (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Two programmers named Jack and Irving worked at a small company that
developed productivity software. Jack wanted his name to come first in
the About box. In a petty move, Jack hid code in the program that
would move his name to come first in the About box on the first day of
the new year. However, this code caused a critical bug that crashed
older Amiga machines, leading to customer complaints. The scenario
reinforces the lesson of always testing code on the lowest-spec
machine your users have. 

 MONGODB VS. SCYLLADB: PERFORMANCE, SCALABILITY, AND COST (11 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 In a recent benchmark comparing MongoDB and ScyllaDB, ScyllaDB
outperformed MongoDB in 132 out of 133 measurements. ScyllaDB is
particularly well-suited for applications dealing with terabyte-sized
datasets that require high throughput and low latency for read and
write operations.
