ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SQLITE-ON-THE-SERVER IS MISUNDERSTOOD: BETTER AT HYPER-SCALE THAN
MICRO-SCALE (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 SQLite on the server is often misunderstood and is more effective for
hyper-scale applications than micro-scale setups. Traditional sharded
databases are complex, inflexible, and can suffer from data
inconsistencies. SQLite-per-partition solutions like Cloudflare
Durable Objects and Turso offer dynamic scaling, global distribution,
and ACID transactions, which allow for a more efficient and manageable
hyper-scale architecture. 

 THE POWER OF INTERNING: MAKING A TIME SERIES DATABASE 2,000X SMALLER
IN RUST (43 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The interning design pattern involves replacing repeated data with
integer IDs to drastically reduce memory usage. Through various
optimizations including interning strings and arbitrary types, schema
tuning like sorting sets and using enums, and custom serialization
with Serde, this developer achieved a 2,000x reduction in data size of
a time series database. The final result was a lightweight,
append-only in-memory database. 

 BUILDING AN INERTIA APP WITH RAILS (27 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Inertia.js with Ruby on Rails can be used to build single-page
applications without a separate API. Inertia.js acts as a client-side
routing library, connecting Rails with front-end frameworks like
React, Vue, or Svelte, allowing devs to replace traditional Rails
views with JavaScript components. This article goes over how to build
a sample web app with Inertia and Ruby on Rails, covering pages,
layouts, data sharing, forms, and authentication within the Inertia
framework.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 KNOWING CSS IS MASTERY TO FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A deep understanding of core languages like CSS and JavaScript is
necessary for frontend dev mastery. Native CSS knowledge often
provides simpler and more efficient solutions than complex JavaScript.


 EVALS ARE NOT ALL YOU NEED (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Evals are AI system evaluations, used for benchmarking language
models, performance testing, red teaming, and optimizing prompts, but
they don't guarantee software performance. There are some issues with
evals, such as the difficulty of creating thorough and realistic test
data, the limitations of automated scoring methods, and the focus on
evaluating base models rather than complete systems. Also, evals often
aggregate results, which fails to account for the unpredictable "long
tail" of possible problem inputs. 

 THE MESS I'M IN (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This developer is disillusioned with academia due to its suffocating
environment that stifles creativity and meaningful work. They plan to
transition to part-time work, making money through consulting,
contracting, and crowdfunding.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LEARN TO BUILD A NEXT.JS WEB APPLICATION WITH SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Develop real-world applications that protect sensitive business
information, ensuring that users have only authorized access. 

 TORII (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Torii is a Rust authentication framework that gives devs control over
user data. It has features like passwordless login, social OAuth, and
passkeys via a plugin system, allowing data storage flexibility. 

 JUSTD (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Justd is a set of React components built on top of Adobe's React Aria
Components that includes TailwindCSS for styling out of the box. 

 AGENTS.JSON (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Agents.json is a spec built upon OpenAPI that standardizes contracts
for API and agent interactions. It introduces flows and links to
describe API call sequences and action stitching, letting LLMs use
APIs properly.

MISCELLANEOUS

 APPLE'S SOFTWARE QUALITY CRISIS: WHEN PREMIUM HARDWARE MEETS SUBPAR
SOFTWARE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Apple's software quality is declining, with new features being
prioritized over current performance. An overheating iPad Air 11" M2
is used as an example, as it lags using Apple's own Notes and Freeform
apps. 

 A NEW AI WORRY: MANY YOUNG CODERS NO LONGER KNOW HOW THEIR CODE
REALLY WORKS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 An over-reliance on AI tools for coding is hurting the critical
thinking and foundational knowledge of young devs. While AI allows
junior coders to produce code quickly, they often lack a fundamental
understanding of why it works. This leads to problems when complex
issues arise in the future, requiring devs to troubleshoot and
understand the underlying code when AI isn't able to. 

 WHAT IS VIBE CODING? HOW CREATORS CAN BUILD SOFTWARE WITHOUT WRITING
CODE (26 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Vibe coding is an AI-assisted approach where you describe software
ideas in plain language and AI generates the code. This means anyone
can create small pieces of software, allowing them to test ideas and
create custom personal apps fast.

QUICK LINKS

 GODOT 4.4, A UNIFIED EXPERIENCE (24 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Godot Engine 4.4 brings a host of quality-of-life improvements, new
features like Jolt Physics integration and embedded game windows, and
optimizations across general platforms, scripting, and systems. 

 CHROME RETURNS 206 WHEN THE SERVER RETURNS 403 (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This dev's website kept crashing when accessing S3, which led him to
discover that Chrome returns a 206 response even when the server
returns a 403 for a range request, a behavior the Chrome developers
consider a feature rather than a bug. 

 WAS GPT-4.5 A FAILURE? (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 GPT-4.5 offers modest improvements in factual accuracy and
instruction following but falls short in reasoning compared to
OpenAI's own o1 and o3. 

 WHY I DON'T NEED TO CLEAN UP MY DESKTOP AND DOWNLOADS FOLDER IN MACOS
(5 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 You can use the temporary `/tmp` directory for temporary files and
downloads, and you can also configure screenshots to copy to the
clipboard instead of saving to disk.
