 TESTING FRONTEND ‚Äî LESSONS FROM OVER A MILLION LINES OF TYPESCRIPT
AT PALANTIR (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Focus on unit tests with the right scope, avoid unnecessary component
tests, and leverage stable APIs to create scalable integration tests
that require minimal maintenance. Having good tests helps maximize
engineering velocity, and automated generated tests may help codebases
be better tested in the future. 

 A LOCAL-FIRST CASE STUDY (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This developer created a local-first web app for trip planning. It
was designed to address shortcomings in existing trip planning tools
by offering quick data entry, easy comparison features, and support
for both structured and unstructured data. The app was built using a
local-first architecture using CRDTs and the Yjs library for real-time
collaboration and offline functionality. 

 A GUIDE TO DESTRUCTURING IN JAVASCRIPT (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Destructuring in JavaScript allows you to extract values from arrays
and objects into separate variables. The ellipsis (...) in
destructuring represents a "rest property," which captures remaining
elements or properties into a new array or object. It also acts as the
"spread operator," which expands iterables like arrays, objects, and
strings into individual elements.

 DO ALL PROBLEMS HAVE TECHNICAL FIXES? (6 MINUTE READ) [9]
