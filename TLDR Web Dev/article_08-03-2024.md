 WHY FACEBOOK DOESN‚ÄôT USE GIT (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Facebook uses Mercurial instead of Git. While performance limitations
triggered the migration, the key deciding factor in the choice proved
to be the openness and collaborative spirit of the Mercurial
community. Facebook's success in smoothly migrating its engineering
org was thanks to thoughtful communication and human elements
alongside other technical reasons. 

 "REACT-STRICT-DOM", WHY IT'S SO GREAT? (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta‚Äôs react-strict-dom (open sourced last week) is an experimental
integration of React DOM and StyleX that standardizes the development
of styled React components, both web and native. This article goes
into the historical background of building a universal codebase that
shares components between Web and Native and how react-strict-dom
changes the way we can do it. You might need to refresh the page to
get it to load! 

 ULTIMATE GUIDE TO VISUAL TESTING WITH PLAYWRIGHT (20 MINUTE READ) [6]

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ON PICKING SIDE-PROJECTS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Choosing the right side projects can enhance your T-shaped skills and
offer personal benefits. To maximize success, manage your ideas, focus
on the "why" behind each project, structure for potential wins even if
the primary goal isn't met, and avoid scope creep by setting
boundaries like iterations or timeboxes. 

 HARD AND SOFT SKILLS FOR DEVELOPERS CODING IN THE AGE OF AI (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 As AI developer tooling gets better, developers should also focus on
soft skills such as communication, problem solving, and adaptability
to effectively collaborate with AI tools and create user-centered
solutions. AI offers significant potential but ultimately complements
the existing skillset of developers, allowing them to focus less on
boilerplate and more on strategic development. 

 BUILDING MVPS YOU WON‚ÄôT HATE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The "food truck approach" is a strategy for building scalable and
effective MVPs. The strategy emphasizes focusing on core product
features (like the grill) while carefully selecting supporting
technologies (like frames, wheels, and the engine) and establishing
feedback loops. Engineers play an important role in making technology
easy to understand for non-technical members of the team.

 THE 2038 PROBLEM (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Most Unix systems use a 32-bit signed integer to represent the number
of seconds since January 1st, 1970. A 32-bit variable can only store
integers up to 2147483647. Once system clocks tick past this at
03:14:07 UTC on January 19, 2038, their 32-bit signed integers will
overflow to -(2^31) - this is the root of the ‚ÄúYear 2038 problem.‚Äù


 YOU CAN NOT SIMPLY PUBLICLY ACCESS PRIVATE SECURE LINKS, CAN YOU? (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Popular malware analysis tools often store sensitive private links
due to misconfigured tools and users mistakenly submitting private
content. These links can expose confidential files, smart home
recordings, corporate communications, and more. Users should be aware
of this issue and ensure scans are marked 'private' when sensitive
data is involved. 

 AUTOGENERATING A BOOK SERIES FROM THREE YEARS OF IMESSAGES (9 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 This author wanted to physically browse their iMessage history, which
is difficult with Apple's interface. They found that iPhone backups
contain an 'sms.db' SQLite database with messages. Using SQL queries,
they were able to retrieve their messages. They then generated LaTeX
code to create a paperback book from their messages.
