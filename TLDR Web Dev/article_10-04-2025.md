 5 NON-LLM SOFTWARE TRENDS TO BE EXCITED ABOUT (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Innovations like local-first software, automated reasoning, and
advancements in cross-platform development are trends that are quietly
leading to better developer and user experiences. For example, Notion
was able to improve its web app performance by over 20% by using
SQLite in browser, which is a combination of the SQLite, WebAssembly,
and local-first software trends. 

 WHY YOU NEED A CUSTOM CONTEXT PROVIDER (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 "Naked" React Context providers can be bad for performance due to
unnecessary re-renders. Using custom context providers, which hold
state management logic within a dedicated component, improves
separation of concerns and prevents unrelated components from
re-rendering. This approach uses component composition to make sure
only context consumers update when the context value changes. 

 I GUESS SOME REQUEST HEADERS ARE MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN OTHERS (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Forbidden request headers are HTTP headers that user agents
(browsers) cannot modify. These headers, like fetch metadata request
headers (sec-fetch-*), can reliably show if a request originates from
a user navigating directly in the browser. Forbidden headers like
"Host" cannot be overridden. 

🧠 

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MAN PAGES ARE GREAT, MAN READERS ARE THE PROBLEM (3 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Man pages actually support features like cross-references and
internal links using macros like `.Xr` and `.Sx`. These macros are
rendered as actual links when converted to HTML, but are not supported
by standard man page readers. The problem is that the readers
themselves can't interpret and display these links. 

 SCALING HEIGHTS, WHAT BOULDERING TAUGHT ME ABOUT ENGINEERING
MANAGEMENT (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Bouldering (rock climbing) and engineering management are similar in
that they both require learning, adaptability, and perseverance. Both
involve incremental progress, embracing failure as a chance to grow,
and changing strategies when initial plans don't work. 

 VIBE CODING: SYMPTOM OR SOLUTION? (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Vibe coding is when developers guide AI tools instead of directly
writing code. While it promises increased productivity and more
accessibility for those who don't code, it may also erode deep
technical understanding and create unsustainable development
practices, especially as an application grows.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 KNOCK: INFRASTRUCTURE TO SEND PRODUCT MESSAGING (SPONSOR) [14] 

 Building, managing, and scaling cross-channel notifications gets
complicated fast. Knock [14] is a single API for managing messages
across email, in-app, Slack, push, and SMS. Plus, a visual workflow
builder and template editor anyone can use. All with observability,
like you built it in-house. Send 10k notifications per month for free
[14]. 

 INTRODUCING THE MAX PLAN (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic has introduced the Max plan for Claude, which has 20x
higher usage limits and priority access to new features and models for
those who hit the usage limit often on the current Claude Pro plans.
Users can choose between two tiers, 5x more usage for $100/month or
20x more for $200/month, depending on their workflow. 

 ANNOUNCING THE AGENT2AGENT PROTOCOL (A2A) (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google Cloud has launched Agent2Agent (A2A), an open protocol that
allows AI agents to communicate and collaborate across different
platforms and vendors. It standardizes how agents exchange information
and coordinate actions. A2A has support for long-running tasks and
different modalities (like audio and video). 

 ASK THE DEV (CHROME EXTENSION) [17] 

 Ask the Dev is a context-aware Chrome extension that understands the
webpage you're on and can help answer questions on the page using
LLMs. It only submits the URL you're asking a question on and doesn't
track your browser activity.

 ANTHROPIC EDUCATION REPORT: HOW UNIVERSITY STUDENTS USE CLAUDE (12
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Anthropic's Education Report analyzes one million anonymized student
conversations with Claude.ai to understand AI usage in higher
education. The study found that STEM students, especially those in
Computer Science, are early adopters who use AI for tasks like
problem-solving and output creation. Students mostly use AI for
higher-order cognitive functions like creating and analyzing, which
means there are concerns in creating a dependence and over-reliance on
AI. 

 MAKING NODE.JS DOWNLOADS RELIABLE (8 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Node.js has overhauled its release infrastructure for better
reliability, performance, and maintainability. The new system uses
Cloudflare Workers and R2 to serve release assets more efficiently,
with automated failover, retries, and modern observability tools.
