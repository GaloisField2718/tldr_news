ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 MAKE INVALID STATES UNREPRESENTABLE (11 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Invalid states can lead to runtime errors and less reliable code.
However, by shrinking the gap between representable, valid states,
errors can be moved from runtime to compile time, which allows them to
get caught much earlier. Type systems can and should be used to model
business logic that makes invalid states impossible and
unrepresentable. This article goes through a few examples, such as a
‚ÄúColor‚Äù type that prevents invalid colors. 

 WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT MINIFYING CSS ANYMORE? (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Minifying CSS files directly is less important today compared to
before because popular front-end frameworks automatically handle
minification and code-splitting for developers. Modern compression
algorithms can reduce file sizes a lot and HTTP/2 can efficiently
deliver multiple smaller CSS files. As a result, developers no longer
have to manually minify their CSS.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY WE SUCK AT ESTIMATING SOFTWARE PROJECTS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Software is hard to estimate correctly because requirements change
often, complexities always come up, and external factors can cause
delays. There's no perfect solution to this problem because software
development is inherently a creative process. 

 WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF A UNIT, INTEGRATION, AND E2E TEST? (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Various software engineers were polled on the difference between
different types of tests. The general consensus was that unit tests
test the smallest units of code, like methods. Integration tests
verify interactions between different parts of a system. End-to-end
tests focus on the overall user journey and are more heavyweight.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LANGCSS (WEBSITE) [8] 

 LangCSS is an AI assistant specifically trained on Tailwind CSS to
help you generate forms, buttons, and other web elements easily. You
can chat with it to describe your ideas and the AI assistant will
generate code in real time.

 React Native 0.74 adds Yoga 3.0 (a layout engine), Bridgeless mode as
the default, and Yarn 3 as the default package manager. There are
other updates such as the removal of deprecated APIs. 

 PRAGMATIC DRAG AND DROP (GITHUB REPO) [10]

currently powers products like Trello, Jira, and Confluence.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE RISE AND FALL OF THE LAN PARTY (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 LAN parties were gatherings where gamers would connect their
computers to a local network to play games with minimal network lag.
LAN parties declined over time because the internet got faster and
consoles became more popular. 

 WHY AREN'T WE TALKING ABOUT CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT? (4 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Continuous improvement is a key principle of Agile and Lean, but it's
not as popular anymore in tech companies. Layoffs and transformations
often happen without employee involvement, and there's a general lack
of engagement in improving processes.
