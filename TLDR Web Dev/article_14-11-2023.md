 REVAMPING DASHER FAQ HUB THROUGH SERVER-DRIVEN CONTENT AND WEBVIEW
(10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 DoorDash built a common web app within native mobile applications
that supported rapid content updates and similar content across all
platforms. Its system architecture involved a WebView that interfaced
with Backend for Frontend (BFF) and a backend service. The backend
service managed content stored as JSON, including UI formatting. The
DoorDash team faced challenges in dealing with different platform
messaging protocols, managing the complexity of different message
types as requirements evolved, and maintaining compatibility with
different feature and client versions.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HTML WEB COMPONENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 HTML Web components allow for rendering before JavaScript, promoting
a design of composability and augmentation. React involves creating
components that entirely handle both functionality and rendering with
JavaScript. Long-term success on the web tends to favor technologies
that augment and enhance existing standards, like HTML5 and fetch API,
rather than those that seek to replace them. 

 YOUR SMALL IMPRECISE ASK IS A BIG WASTE OF THEIR TIME (3 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Common workplace issues stem from vague instructions by managers and
leaders. Examples include employees spending excessive time on tasks
due to unclear requirements, misunderstandings leading to
over-preparation for meetings, and projects being delayed because of
misinterpreted directives about modernization. To prevent such issues,
leaders should be precise in their requests and employees should ask
for clarification often.
