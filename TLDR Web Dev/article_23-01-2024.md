ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO BUILD A SCALABLE NOTIFICATION SERVICE (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Razorpay faced challenges like database bottlenecks and slow customer
responses to webhooks when it scaled its notification service. To
address these, it implemented prioritized queues, asynchronous
database writes, and better quality of service for webhooks. The
company prioritized notifications based on customer response times. 

 CACHES: LRU VS RANDOM (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A random eviction policy performs surprisingly well for large caches.
It often outperforms LRU in terms of miss rate, especially when cache
size increases. This may mean that different approaches may suit
different cache levels. Combining LRU for smaller caches and 2-random
for larger ones might be promising. The ‚Äúrandom‚Äù principle applies
to various scenarios beyond cache eviction, like load balancing and
data distribution. 

 A GUIDE TO ENABLING PARTIAL PRE-RENDERING IN NEXT.JS (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 With incremental static regeneration (ISR), Next.js enables the
pre-rendering of pages containing dynamic data during the build time.
This article is a comprehensive guide on enabling partial
pre-rendering in Next.js 14, which lets you control which parts of a
page are pre-rendered.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BACKLOG SIZE IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO HOW OFTEN YOU TALK TO
CUSTOMERS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This author built a successful event/ticket service for comics by
prioritizing customer feedback over assumptions. He believes that
having a large backlog means that you don‚Äôt talk to customers often
enough. Along with recommending talking to customers more, the author
also recommends simplifying UI, observing user usage more, focusing on
loyal customers, and creating more MVPs for learning. 

 HOW TO DRIVE MEETINGS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meetings are crucial for senior engineers, but poorly run ones can
hurt productivity. Before a meeting, set a clear agenda with shared
pre-work. During the meeting, guide the conversation, manage time, and
redirect if needed. After the meeting, finalize follow-ups, clearly
assign ownership, and share meeting highlights with relevant parties.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HEAT.JS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Heat.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that generates
customizable heat maps to visualize date-based activity and trends.
It‚Äôs similar to GitHub‚Äôs yearly contribution heatmap that is
displayed on user‚Äôs profiles. 

 BRIG (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Brig is a user interface toolkit for Node.js. It‚Äôs used to load and
play QML files, which are used in graphical applications to render
objects.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SHIPPING BLENDED DIFFS (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Split Diff view was launched on GitHub back in 2014. The engineer
who shipped it is now looking to ship a new way to review diffs:
blended diffs. Instead of showing 2 lines of changes for a single line
change (one for the deleted line and one for the added line), blended
diffs show the final file view and use AI to generate diff summaries.
This article is an interesting read on how a team found a problem,
designed a solution, went through design iterations, and implemented
the solution with a team of engineers. 

 THE OPEN SOURCE SUSTAINABILITY CRISIS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 For open source to be more sustainable, companies need to contribute
more to open source contributors through financial support. Today,
most open source contributors need to spend extra time on securing
sponsorship or taking on extra work to support themselves. Open source
maintainers often burn out as a result, leading to a lower velocity of
improvement on open source software. 

 READING QR CODES WITHOUT A COMPUTER (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 QR codes have different parts, like finder patterns, separators,
timing patterns, and format information. Mask patterns hide data and
improve readability. Encoding modes specify how data is stored (e.g.,
numeric or alphanumeric). To decode a QR code, one can use a cheat
sheet to identify the mask pattern, read the encoding mode, follow the
reading order, find the total number of content bytes, and decode the
content using a table. This guide takes readers through this process
step-by-step with visuals.

 AN IMPORTANT UPDATE ABOUT RIOT‚ÄôS FUTURE (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Riot Games has laid off 11% of its staff, offering a minimum of 6
months of severance, a commitment to pay out their annual bonus,
health benefits, and more. 

 SO YOU THINK YOU KNOW C? (WEBSITE) [16] 

 A short, 5-question quiz that tests you on your C knowledge - with a
twist. 

 MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEERING OPEN BOOK (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 A free online resource to help with the successful training of large
language models and multi-modal models. 

 BIOME.JS ROADMAP 2024 (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Biome.js is a fast formatter for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and
JSON that can even format malformed code. In 2024, Biome.js
maintainers hope to help more users move to Biome, expand Biome‚Äôs
language support, and deepen Biome‚Äôs existing capabilities.
