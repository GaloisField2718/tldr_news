 HOW AIRBNB POWERS PERSONALIZATION WITH 1M EVENTS PER SECOND (13
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Airbnb's User Signals Platform (USP) processes over one million
events per second to power real-time personalization across its
platform. The USP uses a Lambda architecture, combining Flink-based
real-time streaming with offline batch processing to ingest,
transform, and store user actions in a versioned key-value store. This
platform exposes a clean interface for product teams to define signals
and user segments without needing stream processing expertise. 

 PYTHON'S NEW T-STRINGS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Python 3.14, expected in late 2025, will introduce template strings
(t-strings), a safer and more flexible approach to string processing
compared to f-strings. T-strings evaluate to a `Template` object,
separating the string from its interpolated values, which allows for
custom processing and escaping to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL
injection. Devs can access the raw string parts and values through
properties like `.strings` and `.values` or iterate over the template
to process each part individually.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW I USE KATE EDITOR (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This developer loves the Kate text editor and has used it for many
years. They go over their Kate setup, including preferred plugins,
custom settings for language servers and debug adapters, and
personalized shortcuts. Some productivity-oriented features from Kate
that have helped them a lot are quick file switching, action search,
build and run capabilities, and more. 

 PIPELINING MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FEATURE (17
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Pipelining is a programming language feature that allows omitting an
argument by passing the previous value. Pipelining syntax is great for
its readability, editing usability, and integration with IDE code
discovery.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 OPEN CODEX (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 Open Codex is a fully open-source command-line AI assistant inspired
by OpenAI Codex that runs locally using models like phi-4-mini. It
requires no API key. Open Codex translates natural language into shell
commands. It prompts for confirmation before execution. The assistant
is available for macOS, Linux, and Windows. 

 HAKO (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Hako is an embeddable, lightweight, secure, and high-performance
JavaScript engine forked from PrimJS. It compiles to WebAssembly for
memory safety and provides a built-in sandboxing mechanism to restrict
JavaScript code capabilities.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LOCAL LLM INFERENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Local LLM inference is promising but not yet production-ready. While
local LLMs are cheaper, private, and can work offline, their
performance is still not good enough for most use cases. Also, it's
difficult to find and deploy suitable small models for specific tasks.


 GETTING FORKED BY MICROSOFT (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Philip Laine developed Spegel to solve container image registry
downtime issues. Microsoft then contacted Laine and expressed interest
in Spegel, leading to discussions about a potential collaboration.
However, Microsoft created Peerd, a similar project, and included code
and tests directly copied from Spegel, with minimal attribution.
Despite this, Spegel is still a successful project, but it shows the
challenges open-source maintainers face when interacting with large
corporations.

QUICK LINKS

 THIS BLOG IS HOSTED ON A NINTENDO WII (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Hosting a blog on a Nintendo Wii running NetBSD is possible - the
console is actually surprisingly capable performance-wise. 

 I DON'T SEE WHY NOT (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Demis Hassabis (CEO of Google DeepMind) predicts that AI will cure
all diseases within the next decade, though the author of this article
is skeptical of the claim. 

 AI-ASSISTED SEARCH-BASED RESEARCH ACTUALLY WORKS NOW (6 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Recent AI models like o3, o4-mini, and Gemini 2.5 Pro have made
AI-assisted search-based research genuinely useful and reliable.
