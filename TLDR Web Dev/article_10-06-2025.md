 ONE NOTETAKER API FOR ALL THE MEETING APPS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Notetakers will soon outnumber actual meeting attendants - but you
don't need to build one from scratch.

The Nylas AI meeting notetaker [4]:

 	* sends bots to join Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom calls;
 	* records, transcribes, and diarizes every call;
 	* and delivers the results directly to your app.

Get: complete customer context [4] from every conversation with
built-in calendar sync.

Don't: build anything, maintain any pipelines, or integrate with a
dozen different calendar and meeting APIs.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW OPENAI USES APACHE KAFKA AND FLINK FOR GENAI (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI uses Apache Kafka and Flink in its real-time data streaming
infrastructure. Kafka handles high-volume data ingestion and delivery
across multiple cloud regions, while Flink processes this data with
low latency, allowing for continuous feedback loops and real-time AI
operations. OpenAI uses custom enhancements to scale PyFlink, manages
Kafka consumption with Kafka Forwarder, and consolidates Kafka
clusters with a multi-cluster architecture. 

 HOW IMPORTS WORK IN RSC (23 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 React Server Components (RSCs) extend JavaScript's module system to
span both client and server, using directives like 'use client' and
'use server' to clearly define where code runs. Instead of copying
code between environments, these directives act like controlled entry
points, while “poison pills” like server-only or client-only
imports prevent accidental leaks by causing build-time errors. This
creates two separate but connected module systems, allowing safe code
sharing and controlled data flow between frontend and backend. 

 RESILIENT IMPORT MAPS - BETTER THEME DEVELOPMENT AND BEYOND (2025) (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Shopify discovered that JavaScript import maps were too fragile for
real-world use. They would break if any modules loaded before them or
if multiple maps existed on the same page. Working with web standards
experts, Shopify developed and implemented a reconciliation mechanism
that allows multiple import maps and modules to coexist safely, which
shipped in Chrome 133 and Safari 18.4.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 LLMS ARE CHEAP (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Contrary to common belief, LLMs are now relatively cheap to operate.
When comparing LLM pricing to web search API costs, LLMs can be much
cheaper, even when accounting for token usage and response length. 

 WHY GO IS A GOOD FIT FOR AGENTS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Go is a good fit for building AI agents due to its concurrency model,
channel-based communication, centralized cancellation mechanism,
standard library, and excellent profiling tools. Go's simple
concurrency allows for efficient handling of many long-running agent
processes, while channels facilitate asynchronous message passing. 

 WHY AGENTS ARE BAD PAIR PROGRAMMERS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Current LLM agents make poor pair programmers because they code too
quickly for human collaboration. Instead, they are better for
asynchronous workflows like code review or in slower, turn-based
modes.

 9 DEVELOPER ENABLEMENT PRACTICES FOR ENTERPRISE DEVOPS (SPONSOR) [11]


 Over the last few decades, dev-to-ops ratios have gone from 6:1 to
25:1 [11]. How do you maintain scalable architecture, operations, and
governance? According to Datadog's Director of Software Architecture,
the answer starts with a metrics-driven mindset. Read the eBook [11] 

 APPLE SUPERCHARGES ITS TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR DEVELOPERS (25
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple has announced a range of new tools and technologies for devs in
the Apple ecosystem. It has introduced a redesigned software interface
incorporating "Liquid Glass" for a more visually appealing and
intuitive user experience. Developers can now use the Foundation
Models framework for on-device AI capabilities and integrate large
language models like ChatGPT directly within Xcode 26 for coding
assistance. 

 REACT NATIVE DEVTOOLS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 React Native DevTools is a macOS app that makes debugging for
React-based applications easier. It provides real-time monitoring and
management of React Query state, device storage, and environment
variables with a native interface. 

 QNM (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Qnm is a CLI utility to quickly query and inspect the `node_modules`
directory. It has features like interactive fuzzy-search, version
checking, monorepo support, and explanation of package installation
origins.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BRUTEFORCING THE PHONE NUMBER OF ANY GOOGLE USER (9 MINUTE READ) [15]


 A security researcher discovered a vulnerability in Google's username
recovery form that allowed them to brute-force phone numbers
associated with Google accounts, even with JavaScript disabled. The
attack involved using the form without JavaScript, obtaining a
botguard token from the JS-enabled form, and exploiting IPv6 addresses
to bypass rate limits. They also found a way to leak a user's display
name through Looker Studio to target specific accounts. 

 A BIT MORE ON TWITTER/X'S NEW ENCRYPTED MESSAGING (21 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 XChat is X's new end-to-end encrypted messaging protocol. It uses a
key storage system called Juicebox. XChat has a major vulnerability in
its key storage approach, where user private keys are stored on X's
servers, allowing X to decrypt messages. Juicebox hardens passwords by
splitting key material across multiple servers, but its security
depends on the use of Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and distributed
trust, which are questionable in XChat's implementation.

QUICK LINKS

 WRITE MORE RELIABLE JAVASCRIPT WITH OPTIONAL CHAINING (4 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Optional chaining (?.) in JavaScript is a cleaner, safer, and more
concise way to access deeply nested object properties by
short-circuiting the evaluation and returning undefined without errors
when encountering null or undefined values. 

 CONTAINERIZATION (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 Apple's Containerization package allows applications to run Linux
containers on Apple silicon Macs by using Virtualization.framework,
providing APIs to manage OCI images, interact with registries, create
file systems, and more. 

 ADD APP SHORTCUTS TO YOUR EXPO APPLICATIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This blog post explains how to add custom app shortcuts to React
Native Expo applications using the `expo-quick-actions` library. 

 GETTING PAST PROCRASTINATION (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Action precedes motivation, so small steps are needed to initiate
productivity and avoid procrastination.
