ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REACT, VISUALIZED (13 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This article provides a visualized walkthrough of React, explaining
its historical context by contrasting it with jQuery, Backbone.js, and
AngularJS. React's main innovation is representing the view as a
function of the application's state (v = f(s)), implemented through a
component-based API that uses JSX for combining HTML and JavaScript.
The article details key concepts like managing props (data passed
between components), state (data within components), rendering
(updating the UI based on state changes), and effects (managing side
effects), along with advanced topics like Context and refs. 

 RUNNING GPT-2 IN WEBGL: REDISCOVERING THE LOST ART OF GPU SHADER
PROGRAMMING (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 GPT-2 can be implemented in WebGL using GPU shader programming. Early
programmable shaders paved the way for general-purpose GPU (GPGPU)
computing. This dev repurposed textures, framebuffers, and fragment
shaders to perform neural network operations on the GPU, treating the
graphics pipeline as a parallel engine.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DON'T SOLVE PROBLEMS YOU DON'T HAVE. YOU'RE LITERALLY CREATING
PROBLEMS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Prioritize present, tangible problems over hypothetical ones.
Focusing on immediate needs and consequences allows for faster
iteration and adaptation based on real-world usage. Prematurely
addressing potential issues can be a distraction that leads to
unnecessary complexity and delays. 

 THE HIDDEN COST OF SKIPPING THE FUNDAMENTALS IN THE AGE OF AI (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI is so easy to use that it encourages skipping fundamental
understanding, leading to fake "working" solutions. This shortcutting
results in fragile, unmaintainable codebases. 

 JUST USE REACT (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Modern JavaScript frameworks like React are necessary for complex web
applications despite the appeal of "pure HTML." While simple HTML is
fine for basic websites, frameworks offer necessary tools for managing
state, creating reusable components, and easily updating the UI in
interactive and dynamic applications. They also aid in accessibility
at scale and provide a better developer experience.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SUPERBLOCKS, NOW POWERED BY CLARK—THE FIRST AI AGENT TO BUILD
INTERNAL ENTERPRISE APPS (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Unlike vibe coding tools, Clark generates secure, production-grade
apps using your design systems, RBAC, and integrations—all inside
the Superblocks platform. Business users, engineers, and IT can
finally build internal apps together. Learn more at
superblocks.com/clark [9]. 

 FLOWGRAM (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Flowgram is a node-based flow building engine that lets developers
create visual workflows with AI capabilities using either fixed or
free-form layouts. 

 LUMOSQL (WEBSITE) [11] 

 LumoSQL makes the SQLite embedded data storage library better by
adding security, privacy, performance, and measurement features. It
includes pluggable backends, encryption, corruption detection, and a
unique "Not-forking" tool for tracking upstream changes. 

 GOOGLE GEN AI SDK FOR TYPESCRIPT AND JAVASCRIPT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 The Google Gen AI JavaScript SDK lets TypeScript and JavaScript
developers build applications powered by Gemini, with features like
accessing models, managing caches, creating chats, and uploading
files.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TRIP REPORT: NODE.JS COLLABORATION SUMMIT (2025 PARIS) (10 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Twice a year, a group of Node contributors and community members meet
to discuss the project, brainstorm ideas, and push new initiatives.
This time, they talked about the recent CI security incident, Async
Context, and the ability for Node.js to compile apps into executables.


 TRYING TO TEACH IN THE AGE OF THE AI HOMEWORK MACHINE (15 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 AI is increasingly used for cheating in classes, leading to a decline
in real learning and engagement with the material. This results in an
adversarial dynamic in grading. To combat this, more professors are
adopting pen-and-paper methods in the classroom, focusing on the
process of learning rather than the polished final product.

QUICK LINKS

 PYREFLY VS. TY: COMPARING PYTHON'S TWO NEW RUST-BASED TYPE CHECKERS
(17 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Pyrefly and ty are two new Rust-based Python type checkers - ty
prioritizes a gradual approach to typing that avoids introducing new
errors in working code, while Pyrefly aggressively infers types,
potentially finding more errors but also creating false positives. 

 HOW JAVASCRIPT'S AT() METHOD MAKES ARRAY INDEXING EASIER (2 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Array.prototype.at() returns the element at the index - you can pass
in -1 to get the last item and it's an overall readability
improvement. 

 CENTRALIZE HTTP ERROR HANDLING IN GO (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A Go pattern for centralizing HTTP error handling is to define custom
HTTP errors, create a handler wrapper that returns errors, and write
cleaner handlers that focus on business logic instead of repetitive
error handling code. 

 BUILDING SOFTWARE ON TOP OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (4 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 This is a 3-hour-long PyCon workshop on building with LLMs, with
interactive exercises covering everything from basic prompting to
advanced techniques like tool usage and RAG.
