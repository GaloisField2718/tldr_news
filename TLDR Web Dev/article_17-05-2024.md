 WHY DO CPUS HAVE MULTIPLE CACHE LEVELS? (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CPUs have multiple cache levels to balance speed and size. The L1
cache is small and fast, primarily for storing frequently used data at
the byte level. The L2 cache is larger but slower. It deals with cache
lines (groups of bytes) and handles most communication between the CPU
core and other components. The L3 cache is even larger and slower,
serving as a shared resource for multiple cores and handling less
frequent requests. 

 5 EASY TIPS TO IMPROVE YOUR PERSONAL WEBSITE PERFORMANCE (11 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Serve static HTML whenever possible instead of relying on server-side
rendering to improve your personal website's performance. Optimize
images by converting them to next-gen formats and using the `picture`
element for browser compatibility. Also, use system fonts to avoid the
performance issues of loading custom fonts and try to not have
render-blocking resources. 

 YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO VALIDATE UTF-8 STRINGS (21 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The design of strings in Rust and Julia are different. Rust enforces
UTF-8 validation, while Julia allows invalid UTF-8. Rust treats all
code as production-quality, while Julia encourages hacking and
prototyping. Julia's flexibility with string encodings is often more
practical and efficient.

 TEST DRIVING CHATGPT-4O (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This author tested ChatGPT-4o's ability to solve a math problem using
five different approaches. They experimented with text-only prompts,
multi-modal prompts with images, and prompts with chain-of-thought
prompting. The most successful approach was the text-only prompt with
chain-of-thought prompting, which resulted in consistently correct
answers. The multi-modal prompts led to incorrect answers because the
AI misinterpreted the image details.

MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI-centric communication is expected to fuel a new wave of tech
companies and products, similar to how social media platforms arose
from earlier internet technologies. While most communication today is
done with people through technology, eventually people could primarily
just communicate with technology (AI) itself. This will impact human
behavior and interaction, but in what direction is unclear.
