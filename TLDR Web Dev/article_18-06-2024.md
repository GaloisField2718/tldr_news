OPINIONS & ADVICE

 A NOTE ON ESSENTIAL COMPLEXITY (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Software engineers can have different goals, ranging from writing
code to delighting users or making money, but managing complexity is
often considered the main duty. Complexity can be either essential
(inherent to the problem) or accidental (introduced by
implementation). Software engineers should always aim to minimize
accidental complexity and assist with essential complexity. Engineers
can redefine essential complexity by influencing user expectations and
organizational processes.

 THE RISE‚ÄîAND FALL‚ÄîOF THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPER (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The demand for software developers in the U.S. has decreased since
the pandemic despite high salaries and perks, with fewer developers

 WHY GOOGLE MAPS DOESN'T HAVE A ‚ÄúNICEST ROUTE‚Äù FEATURE (3 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 While a "scenic route" feature in Google Maps sounds appealing and

a global scale. Such a feature would introduce bias into the system,

and revenue away from low-income communities. These are the kinds of
n-th order consequences that must be thought of when making seemingly
harmless features in large systems like Google Maps.
