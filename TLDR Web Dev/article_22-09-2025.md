 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 LESS IS SAFER: HOW OBSIDIAN REDUCES THE RISK OF SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS
(3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Supply chain attacks involve malicious updates sneaking into
open-source code. Obsidian minimizes risk by depending on minimal
third-party code, often re-implementing functions or forking modules
when feasible. When using larger libraries, Obsidian uses version
pinning and lockfiles, guaranteeing a deterministic build process. 

 BRINGING OBSERVABILITY TO CLAUDE CODE: OPENTELEMETRY IN ACTION (16
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Claude Code can be monitored using OpenTelemetry and SigNoz to gain
visibility into its usage and impact. By using OpenTelemetry for data
collection and SigNoz for visualization and alerting, teams can track
important metrics like token usage, cost, and performance trends. This
article shows how to set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Claude
Code. 

 CLAUDE CAN (SOMETIMES) PROVE IT (19 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Claude Code is quite good at interactive theorem proving (ITP), a
difficult formal method used to verify critical systems. Claude Code
can complete complex proof steps independently, but still requires
human guidance for the overall formalization. This points towards a
future where ITP is more accessible and doesn't require expert
knowledge.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 RULES FOR CREATING GOOD-LOOKING USER INTERFACES, FROM A DEVELOPER (13
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Developers can create good-looking user interfaces with minimal
effort if they focus on alignment and consistency. To make life
easier, use component libraries and avoid customization so that the UI
stays consistent. Also, limit variable font weights and text colors. 

 HOW TO STOP FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article shows how a ban on functional programming can lead to
convoluted and less efficient code, showing off the absurdity of
avoiding functional programming principles entirely.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ATLASSIAN REPORT: AI IS DELIVERING FOR SERVICE MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR)
[14] 

 Turns out AI isn't coming to service ops — it's already here.
Atlassian's State of AI report [14] reveals 88% of organizations are
leveraging AI in service management, with 78% reporting increased
efficiency and 80% making better data-driven decisions. The report
covers AI adoption patterns, implementation challenges, and measurable
impacts across industries. Download the full report [14] 

 FUMA DOCS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 FumaDocs is a React.js framework for building documentation websites.
It supports Next.js and Vite-based frameworks. 

 DYAD (WEBSITE) [16] 

 Dyad is a free, local, and open-source AI app builder designed as an
alternative to platforms like Lovable and v0 that allows users to
create apps without coding. It has features like Supabase integration,
support for various AI models, and local source code. 

 SJ.H (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Sj.h is a lightweight JSON parsing library written in C99, consisting
of only about 150 lines of code. It operates without dynamic memory
allocation, uses minimal state, and provides error messages with
location details. The library handles JSON structure, but requires
external functions for number and string parsing.

 APPLE'S THINNEST IPHONE STILL STANDS UP TO REPAIRS (11 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 The iPhone Air, Apple's thinnest iPhone, surprisingly prioritizes
repairability through clever design choices. By shifting the logic
board and using a flat disassembly tree, the phone avoids stacking
components, making repairs easier. The battery is easily accessible
with electrically debonding adhesive, and the USB-C port is modular. 

 THE HIDDEN RISK IN NOTION 3.0 AI AGENTS: WEB SEARCH TOOL ABUSE FOR
DATA EXFILTRATION (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 CodeIntegrity discovered a vulnerability in Notion 3.0's AI Agents
related to its web search tool that allows for data exfiltration. By
embedding a malicious prompt within a seemingly harmless PDF,
attackers can trick the AI agent into querying a controlled server
with sensitive data extracted from the user's Notion pages. This
indirect prompt injection attack exploits the agent's tool access. 

 I FORCED MYSELF TO SPEND A WEEK ON INSTAGRAM INSTEAD OF XCODE (8
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This dev did an experiment where he spent a week focusing solely on
marketing his Lagree Buddy app instead of coding. He created daily
Instagram story arcs, reached out to studios and trainers, and even
took a class with Sebastian Lagree. He found cold DMs to be
surprisingly effective, showing the importance of relationships and
visibility over continuous feature development.

 DESIGNING NOTEBOOKLM (8 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 The Design Lead for NotebookLM designed a responsive three-panel
system to address "tab overwhelm" by integrating reading, writing, and
creation into one space, which prioritizes a linear workflow: Inputs,
Chat, and Outputs. 

 STATE IN THE URL IN REACT (THE RIGHT WAY) (3 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 To manage state in the URL in React effectively, avoid directly
accessing the global window or using `useState` for URL parameters,
and instead, create a custom hook that uses react-router to
synchronize the UI with URL search parameters. 

 VIBE CODING CLEANUP AS A SERVICE (5 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 "Vibe Coding cleanup" is a new market emerging where specialists are
increasingly needed to fix the messy, insecure, and contextually
flawed code generated by AI tools. 

 THE BLOAT OF EDGE-CASE FIRST LIBRARIES (9 MINUTE READ) [24] 

 Many libraries are over-engineered to handle unlikely edge cases,
leading to unnecessary bloat and complexity in dependency trees.
