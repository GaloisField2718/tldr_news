 USING A/B TESTING TO ‚ÄúSOFT DISABLE‚Äù UNUSED FEATURES AND REDUCE
UNNECESSARY CALLS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 With 10 billion page views per month and 8 million daily users (as of
March 2023),¬†unused features have a price - whether that's cloud
resources or carbon emissions.

As part of its responsibility to minimize digital emissions, Leboncoin
(part of¬†Adevinta) implemented a ‚Äùsoft disabling‚Äù mechanism that
deactivates features based on user interaction.

Visit the Adevinta tech blog [4] to learn more about the
implementation and the results. Read the article [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW DOES SESSION REPLAY WORK? (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Session replay provides qualitative views of user interactions that
have already happened. It works by reconstructing the changes made to
the DOM rather than literally recording the screen. This involves
re-applying the CSS to the HTML and using open-source software like
rrweb to record and replay these DOM changes. 

 A MILESTONE FOR TYPESCRIPT PERFORMANCE IN TANSTACK ROUTER (10 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 TanStack Router, a type-safe routing library for TypeScript, made
performance improvements to address a bottleneck in TypeScript's
language service when handling large route trees. The issue stemmed
from the language service having to infer types for the entire route
tree, even when only a specific route was referenced. To solve this,
TanStack Router introduced a new approach for file-based routing where
the route tree is explicitly declared instead of inferred, allowing
the language service to infer types only for the relevant route. 

 INTERNING IN GO (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Go's new `unique` package can improve memory usage by interning
objects, specifically strings, to avoid storing duplicate copies.
Interning, by reusing identical objects, reduces memory usage compared
to other approaches. This post illustrates this through a program that
processes a large text file, identifying all words starting with "B"
and comparing the memory usage of different methods: storing
references, cloning strings, and using the `unique` package.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 REMIX'S CONCURRENT SUBMISSIONS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED (WITHOUT
CAUSAL ORDERING) (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Remix's approach to concurrent submissions, using a "submission and
revalidation" pattern, is fundamentally flawed. It leads to
unnecessary latency and introduces race conditions where the UI can
display outdated information, even after users have submitted changes.
There are two solutions: Causal ordering, which makes sure requests
are processed in the order they depend on each other, and Persistence,
where a connection is maintained between the client and server to
guarantee ordered processing. 

 THE HIDDEN COSTS OF OVER-COLLABORATION (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Over-reliance on collaboration has hidden costs. Excessive
collaboration can reduce overall output due to time spent in meetings
and can create expensive interactions between teams that are not
always necessary. It can also hide deeper-rooted problems, like
inefficient workflows and unclear team boundaries. 

 STOP LEARNING TO GIVE FEEDBACK. LEARN TO RECEIVE IT (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Receiving feedback well means approaching feedback with curiosity and
seeking clarification when possible. It's also important to avoid
immediate counterarguments when receiving feedback and instead create
a safe environment for the feedback giver to be honest with you.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DAVID NEAL OF REVERENTGEEK TO HEADLINE CAMUNDACON IN NYC (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 The CamundaCon Process Orchestration Conference [11] is coming to New
York City (and streamed live online)! On the agenda: A keynote by
Microsoft MVP and Author David Neal (ReverentGeek), hands-on
workshops, talks by process automation experts at top-tier companies,
and many surprises. Buy a ticket to attend in-person or register
virtually for free. [11] 

 NITRO (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Nitro is a framework for developing high-performance native modules
in React Native. It achieves this through hybrid objects, which are
native objects implemented in C++, Swift, or Kotlin that provide
direct access to native functionalities. Nitro uses a lightweight
layer built on JSI and bridges directly to Swift and Kotlin while
still prioritizing type safety and null-safety by using a
code-generator to make sure that TypeScript specifications are the
single source of truth for both JavaScript and native code. 

 ELECTRICO (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Electrico is a lightweight, cross-platform alternative to Electron
that uses Rust and Javascript to emulate Electron and Node APIs within
embedded WebViews. This lets users run Electron apps without bundling
Node.js and Chromium. 

 FARMHASH (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This is a Node.js implementation of FarmHash, Google's family of high
performance hash functions. It offers various hash and fingerprint
functions with different bit lengths and seeding options.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY WORDFREQ WILL NOT BE UPDATED (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 wordfreq provided snapshots of language usage up to 2021 - it will
not be updated anymore due to several reasons. First, the rise of
generative AI has contaminated online data with AI-generated text,
making it difficult to accurately represent human language usage.
Second, previously free sources of data, like Twitter and Reddit, have
become inaccessible or expensive, making it impractical to collect new
data. Finally, its developer has become disillusioned with the current
state of natural language processing. 

 A GENTLE GUIDE TO SELF-HOSTING YOUR SOFTWARE (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This is a guide for beginners on self-hosting software and using
Uberspace as a platform that emphasizes the software aspect rather
than complex hardware setup. The author goes through the process of
self-hosting two example apps.
