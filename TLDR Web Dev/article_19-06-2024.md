 SCALING SMOOTHLY: REVENUECAT'S DATA-CACHING TECHNIQUES FOR 1.2
BILLION DAILY API REQUESTS (26 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 RevenueCat's caching system handles 1.2 billion daily API requests by
distributing the load among servers and using the cache for hot data.
For low latency, it uses pre-established connections and fails fast on
unresponsive servers. To keep the cache up and warm, it plans for
server failures and uses fallback pools. To maintain consistency, it
employs write failure tracking and consistent CRUD operations. 

 BLAZING FAST WEBSITES WITH SPECULATION RULES (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Speculation rules, a new web platform feature, allow developers to
instruct browsers to prerender or prefetch specific pages for faster
navigation. Prerendering involves downloading and rendering a page in
the background, while prefetching only downloads the main document
resource. This can be achieved using URL lists or document rules with
conditions.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 COGNITIVE LOAD IS WHAT MATTERS (15 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cognitive load is how much mental effort a developer needs to
understand code. High cognitive load is caused by complex code
structures and excessive use of features. To reduce cognitive load,
developers should prioritize simplicity over complexity, use deep
modules with simple interfaces, and avoid an over-reliance on
frameworks. 

 SOFTWARE FRICTION (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Friction is the difference between theoretical plans and reality. It
is caused by unexpected issues like bugs, changing requirements, or
technical failures. Friction can compound in longer timelines, making
each subsequent issue harder to deal with. Teams and developers should
deal with friction early by planning smaller iterations, having more
redundancy, and automating things properly.
