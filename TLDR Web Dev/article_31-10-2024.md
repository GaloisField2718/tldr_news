ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 LESSONS LEARNED FROM A SUCCESSFUL RUST REWRITE (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This developer rewrote a C++ codebase to Rust and, while it was
mostly successful, there were still some interoperability challenges.
Using raw pointers and unsafe blocks in Rust proved to be a major
source of undefined behavior that was often undetected by the compiler
and required tools like Miri for validation. The Rust borrow checker
and the lack of native arena allocators created challenges when
managing memory resources. 

 USECONTEXTSELECTOR: SPEEDING UP REACT APPS WITH LARGE CONTEXT (10
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Using large contexts in React applications can lead to performance
problems, as changing a single value in a large context can cause
unnecessary re-renders of components. There are several proposed
solutions: splitting components, splitting contexts, and using state
management libraries. The `use-context-selector` library, which this
article dives deeper into, provides a way to optimize performance by
selecting and re-rendering only the parts of a context that have
changed. 

 HOW TO ROLL YOUR OWN AUTH IN JAVASCRIPT & TYPESCRIPT (13 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Rolling your own session-based auth in JS/TS is useful for
understanding core web authentication concepts. This article goes over
cookie management, password hashing using Argon2, and
framework-agnostic examples for sign up, sign in, and sign out
functions.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY SPRINTS ARE TAKING THE JOY OUT OF BUILDING SOFTWARE (8 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Sprints are a core element of Scrum, but can be detrimental to
software development. Sprints are too rigid, prioritizing processes
over individual creativity and customer value. Instead, allow teams to
be more flexible about timelines and give engineers more autonomy in
their work. 

 IS PATRICK MACKENZIE'S SALARY NEGOTIATION GUIDE RELEVANT IN TODAY'S
MARKET? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [12] 

 Patrick Mackenzie's classic blog post on salary negotiation is still
relevant today. However, negotiation is becoming more challenging in
this market due to companies' cost-minimization strategies and the
reduced leverage of candidates. Negotiation is still done best when
there are multiple offers to choose from. 

 I ATTENDED GOOGLE'S CREATOR CONVERSATION EVENT, AND IT TURNED INTO A
FUNERAL (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google hosted a "Creator Conversation Event" for independent site
owners who had been shadowbanned by Google's algorithm updates. At the
meeting, Google representatives offered reassurances while subtly
deflecting and avoiding addressing the core issue of shadowbanning and
the negative impact on these creators' livelihoods.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NEW TO THE WEB PLATFORM IN OCTOBER (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The web got updates in October like synchronous iterator helpers,
text fragments, and cookies with partitioned storage in Firefox 131.
Beta releases of Firefox and Chrome have WebCodecs API support, worker
navigator permissions, and CSS highlight inheritance (Chrome-only). 

 MODUS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Modus is an open-source serverless framework that allows developers
to build APIs powered by WebAssembly. It simplifies the integration of
AI models, data, and business logic by using a sandboxed execution
environment. Modus supports multiple programming languages, like
AssemblyScript and Go.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE KARMA CONNECTION IN CHROME WEB STORE (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A large-scale scheme involving malicious Chrome extensions disguised
as legitimate tools was discovered. Eleven extensions, seemingly
developed by a mysterious individual with no online presence, have
been found to contain hidden code for affiliate fraud and user
tracking. 

 CREATING A LLM-AS-A-JUDGE THAT DRIVES BUSINESS RESULTS (38 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 LLM-as-a-judge systems have LLMs evaluate LLM responses in order to
make LLM applications better. This article outlines seven steps to
building a great LLM-as-a-judge system: find a “Principal Domain
Expert”, create a diverse dataset, have the expert review and
critique the data, fix errors, build the LLM judge, perform error
analysis, and create specialized judges if needed. 

 CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT CAN REDUCE PERFORMANCE ON TASKS WHERE THINKING MAKES
HUMANS WORSE (20 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting LLMs reduces performance in cases
where thinking also negatively affects human performance. Experiments
across three task categories where thinking harms human performance
(implicit statistical learning, visual recognition, and classification
with exceptions) consistently demonstrate that CoT reduces model
accuracy. This suggests that model reasoning, like human deliberation,
can lead to detrimental outcomes when applied to certain tasks.
