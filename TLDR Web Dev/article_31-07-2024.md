 GOOGLE'S SECRET TO PAINLESS CODE REVIEWS (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google's internal code review tool Critique is highly rated among
software engineers. This article looks at what makes Critique so good
and explains how it pairs with Google's process of code review. It
covers Google's guidelines for efficient code review, internal
statistics on Google code reviews, and how Google uses AI effectively
to speed up code reviews. Critique will never be open-sourced, but
Google maintains a similar open-source code review tool called Gerrit.


 DATA FETCHING IN USEEFFECT VS REMIX LOADER (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 While using useEffect for data fetching is common, it can lead to
several issues, including race conditions, out-of-order responses, and
inconsistent UI states. Remix's loader function, which provides
built-in request cancellation, race condition prevention, and a smooth
user experience, handles data fetching seamlessly. It also allows for
custom loading states and provides flexibility and control over the
user interface. Remix also has pre-rendering capabilities that deliver
pre-rendered HTML with data included. 

 GARBAGE COLLECTION AND CLOSURES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 JavaScript garbage collection doesn't always release memory when a
function is no longer callable, especially if the function's scope
contains references to global variables, leading to memory leaks.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SCOPE? HMM (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In software development, "thoroughness" is a more accurate and
productive concept than "scope" when discussing project timelines.
Thoroughness encompasses the depth of problem exploration,
experimentation, and the longevity of the solution. Rather than
pressuring teams to "go faster" by sacrificing quality, it's more
effective to have conversations about the desired level of
thoroughness and its impact on delivery time. 

 FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES SHOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER AT MUTATION
THAN THEY ARE (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Functional programming languages should embrace mutation more
effectively, as current approaches have significant drawbacks. This
author critiques existing options, including allowing unrestricted
mutation, limiting mutation to specific regions, and using linearity.
A fundamentally new approach that addresses the shortcomings of
current methods and integrates well with existing state management
solutions is needed. 

 ON QUICK AND DIRTY CACHES (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Quick and dirty caches, while imperfect, can be valuable tools for
quickly improving software performance, especially in constrained
environments, as long as developers are aware of their limitations and
trade-offs.

 CALCULATING THE COST OF A GOOGLE DEEPMIND PAPER (18 MINUTE READ) [13]


 The computational cost of replicating a Google DeepMind paper that
explores optimal hyperparameters for large language models is
estimated to be around $12.9 million in H100 GPU hours. The paper
involves extensive learning rate sweeps across different model sizes,
parameterizations, and optimizers, leading to a large number of
training runs. This post provides a breakdown of the compute cost for
each type of experiment, including alignment experiments, learning
rate variants, epsilon experiments, and weight decay. 

 FROM META CTO TO CLIMATE TECH INVESTOR: MIKE SCHROEPFER ON HIS BIG
PIVOT (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Mike Schroepfer, former CTO of Meta, left his role in 2021 to focus
on combating climate change through both philanthropic and for-profit
initiatives, including founding Gigascale Capital and launching Carbon
to Sea. He wants to use technology to provide scalable solutions, such
as enhanced ocean alkalinity, solar geoengineering, and glacier
stabilization. Schroepfer aims to build proof-of-concept models to
demonstrate viable climate solutions. 

 WHY DOESN'T ADVICE WORK? (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 People often ignore good advice, even when it seems obvious and
beneficial. This might be for a few reasons, for example, the advice
might be incomplete without lived experience, people might not
understand the advice, or they might not believe it will work.
Additionally, people might only be seeking reassurance or a way to
start a conversation, and may only consider advice to be a "guardrail"
to prevent catastrophic choices.
