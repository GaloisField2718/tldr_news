ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 MISSION JQUERY ZERO: HOW FREEAGENT REMOVED JQUERY FROM OUR
APPLICATION (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 FreeAgent successfully removed jQuery from its app over the span of
three years. Instead of upgrading jQuery, it transitioned to Hotwire
(Stimulus + Turbo), starting with low-priority areas to test the
approach. Its team tracked progress using simple KPIs, engaged product
teams through training and collaboration, and built internal tooling
to make the transition smoother. 

 STACKED PRS: CODE CHANGES AS NARRATIVE (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Stacked PRs break down large code changes into smaller, more
manageable, and reviewable units by creating a series of dependent
branches. This approach helps developers construct a narrative,
allowing for parallel development as subsequent PRs can be worked on
while earlier ones are reviewed. To work effectively with stacked PRs,
it is necessary to maintain focused PRs, name branches clearly, rebase
often, provide context in PR descriptions, and use draft PRs to show
progress. 

 STOP SYNCING EVERYTHING (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Graft is a new open-source transactional storage engine designed for
lazy partial replication with strong consistency, horizontal
scalability, and object storage durability. It aims to solve data
synchronization challenges in edge environments. Graft allows clients
to sync data at their own pace, retrieve only necessary changes, and
replicate arbitrary data while maintaining strong consistency
guarantees. It achieves this by using a Volume structure and compact
bitsets of page indexes.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE 13 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING LAWS (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post goes over 13 software engineering laws relevant to
engineers and managers using comics and explanations. Each law is
presented with its potential impact on engineering management. The
laws range from well-known principles like Parkinson's Law (work
expands to fill the time available for its completion) to lesser-known
ones such as Zawinski's Law (every program attempts to expand until it
can read mail - those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by
ones which can). 

 WHY I STOPPED USING AI CODE EDITORS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This developer stopped using AI code editors integrated directly into
his workflow. He draws a parallel to his experience with Tesla's Full
Self-Driving, where reliance on the system led to a decline in his own
driving skills. Similarly, he found that constant AI assistance in
coding eroded his fundamental programming skills and intuition. 

 PROGRAMMING WITH AN AI COPILOT: MY PERSPECTIVE AS A SENIOR DEV (11
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI is an evolution of developer tools, not a revolution. It creates
space for creativity and problem-solving. While AI can be helpful for
boilerplate code and learning new frameworks, it's prone to errors and
can produce unsafe code, needing developer expertise and oversight.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WHAT IS THE TRUE COST OF ONE LINE OF CODE? (SPONSOR) [10] 

 What are the true causes of technical debt? How much is it costing
you? And can it be overcome? In this video [10], Prof. Rainer Koschke
from the University of Bremen and Paul Lambert from the Qt Group talk
about how to identify technical debt, understand its impact, and keep
your codebase sustainable. Watch the talk now → [10] 

 TABLEPILOT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Tablepilot is a CLI/API/WebUI tool that uses AI to generate and
autofill tables using various data sources like CSV/Parquet files,
remote datasets, and other tables for context. 

 FAST MCP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Fast MCP is a Ruby library that implements the Model Context
Protocol, allowing for easy integration of AI models into Ruby
applications through a clean API for defining tools, managing
resources, and handling various transports and authentication. 

 TEXTCASE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Textcase is a Python library that provides text case conversion
capabilities, including converting strings between snake_case,
camelCase, Title Case, and more. It has options for custom boundaries
and case definitions.

 IS VITE FASTER THAN TURBOPACK? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Real-world tests comparing Next.js (Webpack & Turbopack) vs. Vite
(Rollup & Rolldown) show that Vite outperforms Next.js for cold starts
and page navigation, while Turbopack is better in Fast Refresh and
Hard Refresh scenarios. Webpack is consistently the slowest. 

 DEBTS, TECH AND OTHERWISE (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The concept of "debt" in software development expands beyond just
technical debt to include areas like product, operations, process,
organizational, and even cultural debt. While debt can lead to future
costs and complexity, it's also a necessary tool for iteration, as
sometimes short-term solutions are needed to ship products quickly. 

 MALWARE HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT: SPYING ON NORTH KOREAN HACKERS (13
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A malware analysis engine detected a malicious NPM package,
react-html2pdf.js, uploaded by North Korean hacking group Lazarus. The
attackers attempted to hide malicious code within the package with the
aim of stealing crypto wallets, browser caches, and keychains while
also downloading additional payloads. An analysis showed the
attackers' debugging process in real-time.

 EVENTUALLY GREEN TESTS: A NEW PARADIGM IN SOFTWARE TESTING (4 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 "Eventually Green Tests" (EGT) is a (satirical) software testing
approach where failing tests are ignored in the expectation that they
will eventually resolve themselves due to code changes, feature
obsolescence, codebase rewrites, or application deprecation. 

 THE SIMPLE THINKING TECHNIQUES THAT WOULD'VE SAVED US $500,000 (7
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Cascade mapping, stakeholder experience forecast, counter-decision
protocol, and second-level decision matrix promote deeper, more
impactful decision-making in engineering teams. 

 WHAT MADE YOU A BETTER PROGRAMMER? (REDDIT THREAD) [19] 

 To become a better programmer, work with experienced people, embrace
mistakes, learn continuously, and apply knowledge through practice and
challenging projects.
