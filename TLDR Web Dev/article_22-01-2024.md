 SQLITE OR POSTGRESQL? IT'S COMPLICATED! (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Both SQLite and PostgreSQL were used - to test performance - when
building a blogging dashboard at Twilio. PostgreSQL outperformed
SQLite for shorter queries but struggled with longer ones. SQLite
handled concurrency better for all query sizes. SQLite also seemed to
provide more simplicity for the application, especially since it was a
smaller one. 

 THE GOLDEN RULE OF ASSERTIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 For effective testing, a test should fail if, and only if, the
intention behind the system is not met. All tests should focus on the
intention of the code being tested and avoid testing implementation
details, which could lead to false test failures. Following these
guidelines helps define test boundaries properly and has developers
consider external factors like dependencies more accurately.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE ‚ÄúERRORS‚Äù THAT MEAN YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Certain "errors" or unexpected outcomes should be seen as positive
results of good decisions and strategies. Not all errors indicate
failure and some are natural side-effects of success. For example,
re-adding features/bugs to the backlog, pivoting a strategy just after
creating it, refactoring infrastructure after significant growth, and
adding or removing words in messaging are all ‚Äúerrors‚Äù that are
side effects of success.
