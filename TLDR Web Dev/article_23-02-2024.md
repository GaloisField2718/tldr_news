 META'S NEW LLM-BASED TEST GENERATOR IS A SNEAK PEEK TO THE FUTURE OF
DEVELOPMENT (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta has created a system called TestGen-LLM that automatically
generates test cases. These test cases are filtered down until there
are only cases that are verified to both work and improve test
coverage of the code base. The system shows how LLMs can be used to
create more reliable software by helping find and catch non-obvious
edge cases in code. It also shows how LLMs can be effectively used
within large codebases and what the future of software testing may
look like. 

 USING LOCALSTORAGE IN MODERN APPLICATIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 localStorage has been supported in most browsers for over fifteen
years, so it‚Äôs a reliable way to persist key-value pairs on the
client side. This article explores the various aspects of the
localStorage API, its advantages and limitations, and alternative
storage options available for modern applications. localStorage is
best used for user preferences, simple settings, or temporary data. It
should not be used for large datasets, querying data, or frequent
read/writes as there‚Äôs JSON overhead and it‚Äôs not asynchronous.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TELL HN: TO BE HONEST... GPT COPILOTS AREN'T THAT GREAT FOR
PROGRAMMING (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [7] 

 Some programmers are finding GPT-based copilot tools useful for
generating simple code, like boilerplate or unit tests. However, many
others say they're not good tools due to inaccuracies or irrelevant
code. Programmers may have mixed opinions on GPT-based programming
tools, but they all agree that the accuracy of suggestions needs to be
better. 

 INTERVIEWING ENGINEERS FOR DIAGNOSTIC SKILLS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SREs and backend engineers need strong troubleshooting skills, but
these are rarely assessed during traditional interviews. To
effectively test for these skills, create an interactive role-playing
exercise where candidates work through a complex bug. This approach
focuses on evaluating the candidate's diagnostic process rather than
simply finding a solution. It tests key skills like their ability to
differentiate between relevant and irrelevant information, the
specificity of their questions, how they handle dead-ends, and their
overall problem-solving strategy. 

 HOW CHATGPT IS MAKING ME LAZY (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ChatGPT can streamline development tasks, making developers
potentially over-reliant on it. The chatbot helped this author remove
local download functionality in the Cloudflare D1 beta. Despite
initial setbacks, they used ChatGPT to iteratively develop a script
solution, starting with JSON to CSV, then TSV, and finally a direct
import to a local SQLite database.

 Phind-70B is a free LLM model that beats the latest GPT-4 Turbo on
certain benchmarks. It is specifically made for fast code generation
and is meant to be used by developers. 

 INTRODUCING SUPERMAVEN, THE FIRST CODE COMPLETION TOOL WITH A
300,000-TOKEN CONTEXT WINDOW (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Supermaven has introduced a new code completion tool that boasts an
unprecedented 300,000-token context window for a deeper understanding
of any codebase. The tool provides AI suggestions tailored to a
codebase's specific APIs and coding conventions, even with large or
unique projects. The model was trained on edit sequences rather than
just files, making it well-suited for refactoring tasks.

 LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ARE DRUNK AT THE WHEEL (22 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The current hype around LLMs like ChatGPT risks obscuring the actual
limitations of the technology and could potentially foster a
counterproductive boom-and-bust cycle within the tech industry. While
LLMs excel at producing human-like text, they cannot reason,
understand truth, or autonomously solve problems. They are also prone
to hallucinations (i.e., they lie) and unpredictable behavior. Despite
this, businesses are rushing to integrate LLMs in often unproductive
ways. 

 IT‚ÄôS OFFICIAL, APPLE KILLS WEB APPS IN THE EU (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apple has confirmed that it is intentionally removing Home Screen web
app installation in the EU, claiming that it is necessary for
compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). However, the decision
directly circumvents the DMA. Apple's actions are probably prompted by
its fear of losing control over app distribution and the associated
revenue. 

 GO RUN (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Go's 'go run' command allows developers to compile and run code
without external build tools or complex setups. This is unlike
JavaScript, where project structure and build tools can vary wildly,
introducing dependencies and potential complexity. Standardized build
systems have made the Go developer experience a positive one.
