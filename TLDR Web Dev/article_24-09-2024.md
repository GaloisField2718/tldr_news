 WHEN POSTGRES INDEXING WENT WRONG (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 When a concurrent Postgres index creation silently failed, the app
that used the database faced performance degradation, almost leading
to a production outage. This failure was exacerbated by the use of
partitioned tables, resulting in inconsistent index usage across
different partitions. To avoid such issues, monitor concurrent index
creation, validate indexes regularly, and create partition indexes
consistently. 

 IMPLEMENTING FEATURE FLAGGING WITH THE NEXT.JS APP ROUTER (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Use environment variables to control feature visibility, validate
them, and then access them within server and client components using
custom functions and a feature provider. This blog post explains how
to implement basic feature flagging with the Next.js App Router. It
demonstrates a practical application of feature flagging by
controlling the visibility of sidebar routes based on feature flags. 

 OPTIMIZING FOR HIGH LATENCY ENVIRONMENTS (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Chrome's User Experience Report provides Round-Trip-Time (RTT) data,
which reveals the network conditions of users. Many users have slower
network connections, so web applications should be able to handle
high-latency environments well. Some strategies to handle these
include reducing transfer size, using a CDN, upgrading to HTTP/2 and
TLS 1.3, and adopting HTTP/3 (QUIC) if possible.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE INTELLIGENCE AGE (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sam Altman describes a new ‚ÄúIntelligence Age‚Äù driven by new AI
advancements. This new era promises massive improvements in various
aspects of life, including healthcare, education, and even solving
global problems like climate change. While AI's potential for
prosperity is immense, there is still a need to navigate risks, like
those related to labor markets. 

 SERIOUSLY, STOP USING RSA (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 RSA is a widely used public-key cryptosystem which is arguably
fundamentally flawed and should be abandoned. Its security relies on
carefully chosen parameters, which developers often fail to select
properly, leading to vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities stem from
subtle mathematical properties that average developers are unlikely to
grasp, making RSA inherently fragile and prone to attacks. 

 MY LEARNINGS FROM 7 FAILED TECH INTERVIEWS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Zach Wilson, an ex-Airbnb staff data engineer, goes through seven
tech interviews he failed over the last decade. He shares learnings
from his time. For example, job hopping early in your career is great
for growth, but not as great after you hit your mid-career.
