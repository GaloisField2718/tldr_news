 MULTI-TENANT RAG VS FINE-TUNING WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS' EXTERNAL DATA
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Relying on foundational models like Llama 3, GPT-4, or Claude under
the hood for your AI application?

Good prompts aren't enough - you need to leverage customer-specific
data [4]. But should you:

 	* Fine-tune the models with customers' external data
 	* Implement RAG (retrieval augmented generation)
 	* Or do both? ü§î

The answer depends on which datasets you have available, how close to
real-time you need the context to be, and security considerations.

This article [4] tackles this topic in great detail and explains how
you should think about each approach.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 LOST IN TRANSLATION: THE BUG THAT SPOKE RUSSIAN AND CRASHED MY APP (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This author was debugging a seemingly random crash in their app, Lipo
Manager, which occurred only after certain users updated their phones.
They found the crash only happened if the device language was set to
Russian due to an encoding issue with SQLite. The fix was simple:
manually set the device locale to 'ru' specifically for Russian users.
The root cause of this bug on the developer's side was because they
used ORMs for data persistence on Android. 

 HOW TO EXECUTE END-TO-END TESTS AT SCALE (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 QA Wolf built a cloud-native infrastructure on Google Cloud that
allows it to run large-scale end-to-end tests. Customers initiate test
runs that are orchestrated by a Run Director service, with tests
executing in isolated pods for reliability. QA Wolf's system not only
isolates tests, but also allows the company to run tests in parallel,
automatically retry failures for flake detection, and optimize
resource usage to keep costs down. 

 STREAMLINE DESIGN SYSTEMS ACROSS WEB FRAMEWORKS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mitosis is a tool that lets you write UI components once and use them
across different web frameworks like React or Vue. This saves
development time and ensures a consistent look and feel for your
applications. By working with Figma, Mitosis can also streamline the
process of turning designs into code.

 5 WAYS TO SHOW YOUR WORK WITHOUT BEING COCKY (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sharing your work is necessary for career growth and visibility, but
can be intimidating. Some good ways to share your work more naturally
include using demo sessions, sharing designs before implementation,
using retrospectives to acknowledge your contributions, and posting on
cross-team chat channels. 

 THE SIMPLE SECRET OF PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Productive people have deep work sessions where they concentrate
solely on the task at hand. It's important to schedule dedicated
sessions of deep work as it actively trains your brain to focus for
longer and allows you to get more work done. 

 A DEVELOPER'S EXPERIENCE REWRITING A NOVEL-WRITING APP (20 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This author rewrote their novel-writing app, Fablehenge, from React
to Svelte because Svelte offered faster development, less code, and a
more enjoyable experience. Svelte's challenges include styling child
components and Svelte 4's reactivity model. The author believes
Svelte's advantages outweigh these and that Svelte could become the
leading framework for new projects. 

 DON'T GET DUPED BY TITLES (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 FAANG companies might down-level experienced hires because they focus
on the project's complexity, not just workers' titles. To avoid this,
take on challenging projects at your current job and be clear about
your target level with the recruiter. Don't be discouraged by a title
change as it might just be a company-specific term.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 [WORKSHOP] SENTRY & SUPABASE PRESENT: HOW TO FIND SLOW QUERIES AND
ERRORS IN YOUR DATABASE (SPONSOR) [12] 

 The Supabase and Sentry integration [12] gives developers real-time
alerts on database and edge function issues, and the context needed to
resolve them: client and server-side traces, breadcrumbs, and errors
for database calls. Learn how to connect a Next.js project to Supabase
[12], integrate Sentry, and fix issues with code-level context and
metrics. Join the May 16th workshop! [12] 

 RX (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Rx is a command-line tool that makes it easy to create, use, and
share development environments. It integrates with whatever tools
you're currently using and gives you a long-running VM in the cloud
that is kept in sync with your local machine. 

 SEMANTIC CACHE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Semantic Cache is a tool for caching natural text based on semantic
similarity. It's ideal for any task that involves querying or
retrieving information based on meaning, such as natural language
classification or caching AI responses. For example, two pieces of
text can be similar but not identical (e.g., "great places to check
out in Spain" vs. "best places to visit in Spain"). Traditional
caching doesn't recognize this semantic similarity and misses
opportunities for reuse. 

 LLAMA3.JS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 A JavaScript implementation of Llama 3 using node-mlx, code modified
from mlx-examples.

 THE SEARCH FOR EASIER SAFE SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 June is a new systems programming language that aims to be easier to
learn and use than Rust. It simplifies memory management using grouped
allocations, so related data shares a single lifetime rather than
tracking individual lifetimes as in Rust. 

 THOUGHTS ON OPENAI (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This is an internal Microsoft email from 2019 that reveals concerns
about falling behind Google in AI and the motivation for partnering
with OpenAI. Microsoft watched how Google Search and other AI
integrations were getting better while it struggled to replicate the
same success. Google's BERT-based models were ahead of Microsoft not
just due to talent, but also because Google had ample AI
infrastructure in place. 

 SELECTING THE BEST NODE.JS VERSION MANAGER (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Choosing the right Node.js version manager can streamline your
workflow. This article explores various options like NVM, FNM, and
Volta, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. It concludes that
Volta is the current frontrunner for its ease of use, cross-platform
support, and ability to manage toolchains.

 SCOPE, NOT TITLES (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 FAANG companies evaluate your interview performance based on the
scope of your past work rather than your job title, so focus on
demonstrating the scope of your responsibilities to avoid being
down-leveled. 

 POPOVER API (WEBSITE) [20] 

 The Popover API, newly available in Baseline, gives web developers a
standard mechanism (using pure HTML or JavaScript) for displaying
popover content on top of other page content. 

 LLAMA3.JS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 A JavaScript implementation of Llama 3 using node-mlx. 

 HOW IT ACHIEVES PLATFORM-AGNOSTIC APPS (11 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Flutter achieves platform-agnosticism through its own rendering
engine, platform channels, and packages that bridge the gap between
the Flutter code and the native platform.
