 SLASHING DATA TRANSFER COSTS IN AWS BY 99% (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AWS charges data transfer fees between regions and availability
zones, which can add up to significant costs. By uploading data to
Amazon S3 within the same region and then downloading it from S3,
users can reduce their data transfer costs to near-zero levels, saving
over 99% compared to standard data transfer methods. This article
provides a detailed explanation and real-world experiments to
demonstrate this cost-saving approach, where they performed a complete
$21.49 data transfer job with only 8 cents.

 WHY NEW HIRES OFTEN GET PAID MORE THAN EXISTING EMPLOYEES (9 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Finding out that a coworker with a shorter tenure makes more than you
is an all too common experience in the tech industry. Often,
experiencing this can leave someone feeling undervalued,
underappreciated, and resentful. This article covers why this happens,
highlighting factors like budget allocation, the importance of
employee retention, and how experience is valued depending on where it
comes from. If an employee finds themselves in this situation, they
should have an open conversation with their manager about their
compensation, hand in a competing offer, and leave for another role if
all else fails. 

 BIG TECH‚ÄôS ROLE IN ENABLING LINK FRAUD (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Link fraud involves the use of URL spoofing, often referred to as
"vanity URLs," to deceive users into clicking on seemingly legitimate
links that lead to harmful content or financial gain for fraudsters.
Ad-supported platforms like Google, Bing, Twitter, and Reddit are
allowing advertisers to abuse unverified vanity URL systems,
contributing to the problem of link fraud. Adtech providers should
validate domain ownership within vanity URLs or consider banning them
altogether to combat link fraud effectively.
