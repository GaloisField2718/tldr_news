 HOW APPLE BUILT ICLOUD TO STORE BILLIONS OF DATABASES (10 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Apple iCloud has an extreme multi-tenant architecture with billions
of databases. The service stores at least one database for each user
using technologies like Cassandra and FoundationDB. Apple's
architecture focuses on asynchronous processing, stateless
architecture, logical resource isolation, and layer abstractions to
handle scalability and reliability needs. Apple ran one of the largest
Cassandra deployments globally, but it still experienced scalability
limitations. FoundationDB, a distributed key-value store, solved its
scalability issues. The article also explains other problems Apple
solved in its journey to supporting exabytes of data and millions of
queries per second in iCloud. 

 DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING IS NOT BLACK MAGIC (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Dynamic programming is used to optimize certain code use cases by
avoiding redundant calculations through caching and memoization. Using
sample problems like the edit distance problem, this article shows
through code examples how dynamic programming can be used in practice.

 CODE REVIEWS (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Code reviews are not just a bureaucratic formality, but a crucial
process to ensure code quality, readability, and maintainability and
prevent future issues. Teams should have clear definitions of "Done"
and coding standards. Some things to look at during code reviews
include PR size, guard clauses, dead code, variable names, and
premature optimization. 

 ASK HN: WHAT IS THE CURRENT DRIVER OF TECH LAYOFFS? (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [8] 

 Hacker News commenters speculate on what is currently driving tech
layoffs, such as the fact that it is now acceptable for tech companies
to do layoffs. Another speculation posits that investors like it when
companies have extreme hiring during the good times and extreme
cutbacks during the bad times. However, each company usually will have
different reasons for doing layoffs.

 HOW M1 MACS MAY LAG BEHIND (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 M1 Macs may lag behind in AI and machine learning capabilities
compared to future Macs with the M2 and M3 chips. Apple silicon chips,
including the M1, have hardware support for AI and ML, but M1 chips
have limited support for recent AI/ML features, such as bfloat16, a
format widely used in AI and ML. M2 and M3 Macs support bfloat16, but
the M1 only supports ARMv8.5A, which doesn't include bfloat16. 

 THE MORE FEATURES YOU ADD... (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Studies show that people judge a product‚Äôs quality by the amount of
features it has before using it. However, after using a product, they
realize the usability issues of having too many features. That means
companies need to build products with many features to maximize
initial sales, but prioritize the user experience to maximize repeat
sales and retention.
