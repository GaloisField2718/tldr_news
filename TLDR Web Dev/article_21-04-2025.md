 CLAUDE CODE: BEST PRACTICES FOR AGENTIC CODING (23 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Claude Code is a command-line tool for agentic coding. The workflow
can be optimized by using `CLAUDE.md` files for context, curating
allowed tools, and using bash tools and MCP. Some common workflows are
shown in practice, like "explore, plan, code, commit" and "write
tests, commit; code, iterate, commit." 

 FASTIFY + REACT IS 7X FASTER THAN NEXT.JS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A recent benchmark comparing server-side rendering performance found
that @fastify/react is 7x faster than Next.js, handling 347 requests
per second versus Next's 49. The test used minimal setups, showing
that Fastify-based integrations like @fastify/vue and @fastify/react
are leaner and faster than full-featured metaframeworks. 

 AMP AND WHY EMAILS ARE NOT (AND SHOULD NEVER BE) INTERACTIVE (9
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's AMP for email tried to modernize email by adding interactive
features, similar to its earlier AMP project for mobile web pages. AMP
for email required significant effort to implement and support, only
worked in a limited number of email clients, and eventually failed to
gain widespread adoption. While Google still uses AMP internally as
"Dynamic Email," the project has been largely abandoned.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 LLMS REDUCE DEVELOPMENT FRICTION. IS THAT A GOOD THING? (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Relying on LLMs can prevent learning opportunities for both a
developer and their team. Engineers should resist immediately using
LLMs for challenging tasks as the temporary struggle can lead to
growth and better code. 

 BETTER ERROR HANDLING (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The traditional `try/catch` method is not great. Better alternatives
include Go-style return tuples and Monadic-style Result types, which
treat errors as values and offer more explicit error management. 

 WHY DO WEBSITES STILL RESTRICT PASSWORD LENGTH? (REDDIT THREAD) [9] 

 Websites still restrict password length, even when long, complex
passwords are more secure. One commenter explains that the limitations
aren't related to database size or DDoS prevention, but rather due to
the input length limits of password-hashing algorithms like Bcrypt.
Others suggest limits are holdovers from older assumptions about
password memorability, legacy systems, or a desire to reduce customer
service requests related to forgotten passwords.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LIVE WORKSHOP: MONITOR AND DEBUG LARAVEL APPLICATIONS WITH SENTRY
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 In this live session, the Sentry team will start with a Laravel app
that's barely held together by try/catch blocks, and Log::debug's —
and get everything back to green check-marks [10] and passing tests by
the end of the session. Join live [10] 

 TWEAKCN (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Websites made with the popular shadcn/ui component library usually
look the same. tweakcn is a visual, no-code editor for shadcn/ui
components that helps devs customize components visually. You can
create custom themes or use pre-built ones. 

 TURNS CODEBASE INTO EASY TUTORIAL WITH AI (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This project uses AI to analyze GitHub repositories or local
codebases and generate beginner-friendly tutorials explaining the
code's functionality and structure. 

 SIDEKICK CLI (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Sidekick is an open-source, agentic CLI-based AI tool designed as an
alternative to tools like Claude Code and Copilot. It lets devs use
various LLM providers without vendor lock-in and supports features
like MCP, undo functionality, and model switching.

 TECH THINGS: OPENAI BUYS WINDSURF, GOOGLE RETAINS ITS LEAD, AND WHERE
THE HELL IS APPLE? (21 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI is in talks to acquire AI IDE Windsurf for around $3 billion,
which seems like a high price given the competitive landscape. At the
same time, Google's quiet but effective strategy of improving AI
models and securing talent has led to its current lead, with models
like Gemini 2.5 outperforming others. Apple's lack of investment in
necessary resources and data collection has left them lagging behind
in AI development. 

 INSIDE ARXIV—THE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE PLATFORM IN ALL OF SCIENCE (21
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 arXiv, created by American physicist Paul Ginsparg nearly 35 years
ago, is an online repository that allows researchers to share findings
and papers before peer review. The platform hosts over 2.6 million
papers, receives 20,000 monthly submissions, and has over 5 million
monthly users. Ginsparg is still deeply involved, constantly improving
arXiv's quality control and filtering of submissions. 

 THINGS ZIG COMPTIME WON'T DO (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 While many languages support generics, serialization, and
metaprogramming at compile time, Zig enforces strict boundaries: no
access to the host machine during cross-compilation, no dynamic code
generation (#eval-style mixins), no custom syntax or DSLs, and no
runtime type info (RTTI). Instead, Zig has partial evaluation and
specialization, allowing for expressive and safe compile-time
behavior.

 THE APPEAL OF SERVING YOUR WEB PAGES WITH A SINGLE PROCESS (3 MINUTE

it to neutralize the competitive threat.
