ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 RECOMMENDING FOR LONG-TERM MEMBER SATISFACTION AT NETFLIX (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Netflix optimizes recommendations for long-term member satisfaction
by going beyond short-term engagement metrics like clicks. It uses a
contextual bandit framework where user actions, like completing a
season or giving a thumbs-down, are used to define a proxy reward
function. This function aims to capture long-term satisfaction and is
iteratively refined through a process called reward engineering. To
address the challenge of delayed feedback, Netflix predicts missing
feedback using observed data and integrates it into the proxy reward
function, allowing for better bandit policy updates. 

 BLOCKING=RENDER: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The "blocking=render" attribute allows developers to explicitly mark
resources as render-blocking, meaning the browser will not display the
page until the resource is loaded. However, this is generally not
recommended, as it can negatively impact performance. The most common
use case for "blocking=render" is in client-side A/B testing, where it
can prevent a jarring experience for users by making sure that the
page is not rendered until all variations are ready. 

 HOW TO MAKE YOUR WEB PAGE FASTER BEFORE IT EVEN LOADS (13 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Events that occur before the first byte of data is received by the
browser are called pre-TTFB (Time to First Byte) events. The
PerformanceNavigationTiming API captures these pre-TTFB events and
provides insights into processes like DNS lookup, connection
establishment, and TLS negotiation. This article explores optimization
strategies for these events, such as caching, DNS configuration, and
minimizing request waterfalls.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 CHATGPT: A PROGRAMMER'S PRODUCTIVITY BOOST, BUT WITH CAUTION (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 ChatGPT is a valuable tool for programming, as it allows developers
to produce code faster than before. However, an understanding of the
underlying principles of the code produced is more important than
ever. 

 THE FRAGILE FUTURE OF OPEN SOURCE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Free and open source software is facing declining industry support
and being negatively affected by developer burnout. FOSS projects may
experience decline or collapse as investment shifts away from
traditional software and fewer people have the time or resources to
contribute.

 BUILDING POSTCARDS FOR ‚ÄúAIRBNB‚Äù SCALE (8 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Airbnb's Media team developed a system to generate unique,
personalized postcards for group trips. The project was complex and
involved matching relevant postcards to destinations, having localized
text formatting, and optimizing performance for various platforms. The
team built a flexible template system, used a destination matching
algorithm, and implemented an asynchronous postcard generation
workflow for fast delivery. 

 THE JOURNEY OF AN INTERNET PACKET: EXPLORING NETWORKS WITH TRACEROUTE
(10 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This article explains how traceroute works and how it can be used to
diagnose network problems. It first explains the journey of an
internet packet and how it traverses multiple routers before reaching
its destination. It then introduces traceroute, which uses the Time To
Live (TTL) field in IP headers to trace the path a packet takes.
Traceroute identifies each router along the path by sending ICMP
packets with increasing TTL values and listening for Time Exceeded
Messages. 

 SCALING RAILS & POSTGRES TO MILLIONS OF USERS AT MICROSOFT: LESSONS &
TAKEAWAYS (44 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 This post contains an interview with Andrew Atkinson, a PostgreSQL
expert at StepChange, which discusses his experience scaling Rails
applications for millions of users. Atkinson shares valuable lessons
learned from his work at Microsoft, where he optimized the
infrastructure for Flip, a video discussion app. He highlights the
challenges of scaling a Rails application with Postgres, particularly
when dealing with heavy read and write operations, and provides
practical advice for developers on optimizing queries, identifying
bottlenecks, and utilizing tools like PG stats and explain plans. The
post encourages developers to leverage ActiveRecord's features like
counter caches and sharding to improve performance and scalability.
