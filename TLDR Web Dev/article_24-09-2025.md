 GETTING AI TO WORK IN COMPLEX CODEBASES (20 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 With core context engineering principles and frequent intentional
compaction, current AI models can be great at handling large, detailed
codebases. AI can rarely produce correct code in one shot in large
code bases, so it needs steps before implementation to do research on
the codebase and plan its steps. 

 THUNDERING HERD PROBLEM: PREVENTING THE STAMPEDE (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The "thundering herd" problem occurs when a cache miss leads to a
large number of concurrent requests hitting the database for the same
record, overwhelming it. There are two solutions: using a distributed
lock to allow only one request to access the database, or using
in-process synchronization with (as an example) Java's
`CompletableFuture` and `ConcurrentHashMap`. While the distributed
lock works across multiple nodes, the in-process synchronization
avoids network calls but doesn't coordinate across nodes. 

 HOW INFOBIP'S INFRASTRUCTURE TEAM HANDLED 10 BILLION MESSAGES IN A
DAY (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Infobip's infrastructure team handles 10 billion messages daily. They
overcame issues like email overloads, data center failures, and
scaling for WhatsApp Business by using cloud solutions,
re-architecting systems, and adopting Kubernetes. A critical
decommissioning mistake in 2024 led to the implementation of delayed
destructive actions, preventing data loss.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I TRIED HTMX, THEN DITCHED IT (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While appreciating HTMX's potential to reduce JavaScript reliance,
this dev found its lack of structure problematic, leading him to
create MESH, a modular SSR framework based on the "one component = one
endpoint" principle. He concludes that he's not using HTMX in the way
it's intended and drops it in favor of simpler JavaScript and SSE. 

 YOUR IMAGES ARE (PROBABLY) OVERSIZED (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Serving appropriately sized images for different screen sizes avoids
wasting bandwidth and compute power. This can be done by using the
`srcset` and `sizes` attributes on the `img` tag to specify multiple
image sources and their intended widths based on viewport size. 

 WHY YOU SHOULD TEST YOUR PAGE WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Devs should test their websites without JavaScript enabled to check
accessibility and resilience. JavaScript can fail due to slow
networks, browser extensions, or user settings, so sites should use
progressive enhancement, starting with semantic HTML that works
without JS and adding JavaScript features as enhancements.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW TO AVOID COMMON AUTHENTICATION MISTAKES (SPONSOR) [10] 

 From token storage to session handling, this guide walks through the
security practices every frontend developer should know. Learn which
approaches protect your users and which mistakes to avoid when
building authentication into modern web applications. 

 TANSTACK START V1 RELEASE CANDIDATE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 TanStack Start has reached its v1.0 Release Candidate. This version
includes type-safe routing, server-first functions, built-in
streaming, and URL-as-state primitives, all while offering flexibility
for both SPA and SSR architectures. 

 OPEN SOURCE AI DATA GENERATOR (WEBSITE) [12] 

 The AI Data Generator helps users generate sample data with various
input parameters, export it in various formats, and explore it within
Metabase. 

 EXPLORING ACTIVE AGENT, OR CAN WE BUILD AI FEATURES THE RAILS WAY? (8
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Active Agent is a Ruby gem that helps integrate AI features into
Rails applications using familiar Rails conventions and patterns. It
introduces "agents" as a new abstraction that encapsulates AI-backed
logic, using action-driven objects, callbacks, and prompt rendering
similar to Rails controllers and mailers.

 POSTGRES' ORIGINAL PROJECT GOALS: THE CREATORS TOTALLY NAILED IT (9
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 PostgreSQL's original design goals from 1986 have shaped its modern
success. These goals included support for complex objects,
extensibility, active database features, and crash recovery, laying a
flexible framework. Postgres' adherence to these principles has
cemented its position as a versatile and trusted database today. 

 VCS TO AI STARTUPS: PLEASE TAKE OUR MONEY (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 VCs are aggressively pursuing investments in top AI startups with
gifts and preemptive funding rounds. Companies like Decagon AI are
fielding unsolicited offers at soaring valuations. This frenzy is
fueled by the belief that AI startups can disrupt tech giants, with a
large portion of venture capital flowing to a small group of
frontrunners. 

 CONTEXT ENGINEERING FOR AI AGENTS: LESSONS FROM BUILDING MANUS (11
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Manus is an AI agent that had improved performance through context
engineering techniques. The devs optimized the KV-cache hit rate by
maintaining a stable prompt prefix with append-only context. They
advise against dynamically changing the action space. The file system
should be used as an extended memory, along with recitative methods to
manipulate attention.

QUICK LINKS

 TARGETING SPECIFIC CHARACTERS WITH CSS RULES (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 CSS can be used to target specific characters for styling through
manipulating fonts and Unicode ranges, though the practical
applications are limited. 

 HOW GOOGLE'S DEV TOOLS MANAGER MAKES AI CODING WORK (5 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 AI coding tools like Gemini CLI are being used for software
development by automating code generation from natural language
requirements and shifting the developer's role towards architecture
and problem decomposition. 

 THE RISKS OF NPM (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A recent NPM attack, the Qix incident, shows the risk of malicious
code injected into widely-used packages targeting end-users by way of
bundled website code. 

 REDUX IN 2025: A RELIABLE CHOICE FOR COMPLEX REACT PROJECTS (8 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 Redux is still a reliable choice for complex React projects due to
its predictability, observability, and architectural clarity.
