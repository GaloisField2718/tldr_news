ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 LEARNINGS FROM OUR 8 YEARS OF KUBERNETES IN PRODUCTION (12 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Urb-it uses Kubernetes to leverage container orchestration
capabilities for its microservices architecture. Some of the lessons
learned after using Kubernetes in production for over eight years
include the importance of keeping Kubernetes and Helm up to date,
backing up secrets, planning for disaster recovery, keeping
certificates up to date to prevent cluster crashes, and going all-in
with a cloud provider. Kubernetes allowed Urb-it to scale in a
cost-efficient manner and develop new products and services faster. 

 HOW MUCH UPTIME CAN I AFFORD? (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Engineering for 99.5% uptime is much more cost-effective than 99.99%
for most startups. This is because in order to achieve that level of
reliability, you will need specialized architecture, redundant
infrastructure, and streamlined operational and organizational
procedures. The cost comes in terms of system complexity, the number
of engineers required and their specializations, experience levels,
and corresponding salaries, as well as significantly increased
operational costs and arrangements. 99.99% guaranteed uptime must be
50 times as reliable as one with "only" 99.5%. 

 BUILDKIT IN DEPTH: DOCKER'S BUILD ENGINE EXPLAINED (9 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 BuildKit is Docker's new default build engine. It improves Docker
builds by parallelizing build steps, optimizing multi-stage builds,
and utilizing layer caching for enhanced performance. BuildKit uses a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) data structure called LLB to represent
dependencies and has frontends and backends to convert Dockerfiles
into LLB and build Docker images efficiently.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING: THE TRADE-OFF WE MAKE WITH TESTS (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Aiming for 100% code coverage can lead to unintended consequences,
such as having engineers write unrelated tests or "cheating" the
system to reach 100% at all costs. Teams should be deliberate in
deciding how much risk to take on when writing tests. Measure the cost
of writing tests versus the cost of bugs to make informed decisions.
In certain contexts, it‚Äôs the ethical thing to do to write extensive
tests, such as for critical software like pacemakers. 

 WE MIGHT WANT TO REGULARLY KEEP TRACK OF HOW IMPORTANT EACH SERVER IS
(2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A significant air conditioning failure in a machine room led to the
need to power off machines to prevent overheating. Deciding which
machines to turn off was not straightforward. Maintaining
documentation on the importance of each machine and its dependencies
is helpful for situations like these. While this documentation takes a
lot of effort, it also helps engineers understand the system's
connections and dependencies, making it a valuable resource in case of
future failures. 

 WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE SOFTWARE (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 There‚Äôs a paradox of software being too powerful and efficient,
which makes it challenging to maintain profitability and often causes
unnecessary software churn. Software today often is never completed
due to the need for yearly growth by companies. Old software
‚Äúrots‚Äù and is then replaced by new and supposedly better software.
The endless quest for growth means that today‚Äôs software often never
gets to reach a state of perfect completion.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GEPPETTO (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Geppetto is a Slack bot that lets teams easily interact with ChatGPT.
It integrates with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 and DALL-E-3 models. Each
message generates a conversation thread. The application uses the
message history to formulate coherent responses. 

 BOUNCY BALL (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Bouncy Ball compares web animation techniques by showing how to
bounce a ball with each one. Multiple code examples in different
languages are shown, including vanilla JavaScript, pure CSS, jQuery,
Anime.js, and more. 

 SERVOR (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Servor is a dependency-free file server for modern web app
development. It supports HTTPS, live reloading, gzip, hot reload,
frontend routing, and more.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY IS THE MOUSE CURSOR SLIGHTLY TILTED AND NOT STRAIGHT? (STACK
EXCHANGE POST) [15] 

 The mouse and mouse cursor was invented by Douglas Engelbart. It was
initially an arrow pointing up. However, screens back in the day had a
low resolution, so having a tilted cursor was more recognizable. This
was first seen in the XEROX PARC machine. 

 HOW SLOW IS SELECT * ? (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 "SELECT *" SQL queries fetch all columns from a row-store database.
This is often quite slow due to issues like index-only scans,
deserialization cost, external storage for large columns, network
cost, client deserialization, and unpredictability. Selecting only the
necessary columns avoids unnecessary overhead and leads to faster,
more efficient queries. 

 INTRO TO WEB MONETIZATION (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Web Monetization API simplifies online payments for website users
and owners by allowing visitors to pay a chosen amount directly to
websites using a browser extension or native browser support. With the
API, website owners no longer need to integrate multiple payment
methods and currencies. Instead, they can merely signal their
acceptance of payments in code, and browsers would facilitate the
payment process.

 POSTGRES IS ENOUGH (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A list of GitHub repositories that demonstrate how PostgreSQL can be
used for everything, including access control, audit logs,
authorization, time-series data, graph data, data visualization, and
more. 

 SQL FOR DATA SCIENTISTS IN 100 QUERIES (48 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Notes and working examples of common SQL queries. 

 COMMAND LINE INTERFACE GUIDELINES (WEBSITE) [20] 

 An open-source guide to help you write better command-line programs,
taking traditional UNIX principles and updating them for the modern
day. 

 WHAT IS A HARD ERROR, AND WHAT MAKES IT HARDER THAN AN EASY ERROR? (1
MINUTE READ) [21] 

 In Windows, "hard errors" are error messages generated from within
the I/O system, below the user interface level. Hard errors of this
type disappeared in 32-bit Windows - the term "hard error" has been
repurposed to describe other critical low-level error messages.
