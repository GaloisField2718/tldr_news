 HOW TO (AND HOW NOT TO) DESIGN REST APIS (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Designing REST APIs using best practices can improve their usability.
This guide goes over multiple tips and examples of how to do so, such
as using plural nouns for collections in URLs, avoiding unnecessary
path segments, and refraining from adding extensions like ".json" to
URLs. It also recommends not returning arrays as top-level responses,
avoiding map structures in JSON responses, using strings for all
identifiers, and more. 

 ANSWERING COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT INTERPRETING PAGE SPEED REPORTS (14
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Performance scores from Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools are sometimes
different from Google‚Äôs PageSpeedInsights (PSI). This is because PSI
uses real life data pulled from Chrome user experience reports, while
Lighthouse uses different data. This post takes a closer look at how
various performance tools audit and report on performance metrics like
core web vitals, why the metric values could be different across
different reports, and what that means about your website's real
performance. 

 HOW BEAR DOES ANALYTICS WITH CSS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bear does not use client-side JavaScript for privacy reasons.
Instead, when a user hovers their cursor over a page, it triggers a
CSS rule that makes a URL request to log the page hit. The code then
checks the user-agent to verify if it's not a bot, extracts browser
and platform information, and hashes the IP address with the date to
create a unique page "read."

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT STAGE STARTUP OFFERS THE BEST RISK-REWARD TRADEOFF? (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Joining a startup at the Series A, B, or C stages offers a balanced
risk-reward profile. Startups backed by top VCs tend to have better
exit odds and valuation growth. To prove this, this article looks
through over 14,000 data points of US-based startups that raised
funds. Employees who joined Instacart during Series C or later rounds
would probably have earned more money if they had opted for a FAANG
company instead or received their compensation entirely in cash and
invested it in the stock market. 

 REFLECTIONS ON QUITTING MY JOB (14 MINUTE READ) [10]

valuable lessons learned, such as the importance of having opinions on
technical decisions, the distinction between writing code and
debugging, and the significance of a clean, understandable Git
history. They also emphasize the importance of understanding hardware,
even in a world of abstractions.
