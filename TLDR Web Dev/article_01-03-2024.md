 HAPPY LEAP DAY! (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Software systems that don't properly account for Leap Days have a
tendency to glitch or fail on February 29th. This year is no
exception, with reports of failures in supermarket payment systems,
airline ticketing, gas station payment terminals, smartwatches, and
even a major video game. To prevent this from happening, software
engineers should use framework-level date libraries wherever possible,
be wary of edge cases, and not assume fixed durations for months and
years. 

 HOW APPLE BUILT ICLOUD TO STORE BILLIONS OF DATABASES (10 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Apple's iCloud and CloudKit were built using a combination of
Cassandra and FoundationDB. Cassandra, which is being actively
improved by Apple engineers, handles exabytes of data and millions of
queries. FoundationDB powers CloudKit, Apple‚Äôs cloud backend
service. It provides key features like transactional guarantees and
solves scalability issues that Cassandra alone could not address. Each
iCloud user gets their own database, resulting in billions of
databases. This is made possible by the Record Layer's stateless
architecture and resource allocation using a ‚Äúrecord store‚Äù
abstraction. 

 INSIDE IMESSAGE EXTENSIONS ‚Äî THE QUIRKY WORLD OF APPLE‚ÄôS NICHE
DEVELOPMENT TOOLS (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Together To Do is an iMessage extension designed to replace
comma-separated text messages with a checkable list. Its developer
found it challenging to integrate SwiftUI into iMessage extensions as
Apple doesn‚Äôt use SwiftUI by default yet. Adding to this, iMessage
functionality in the iOS 17 simulator was broken, making testing
difficult and necessitating workarounds with older simulators or
physical devices. While the potential audience within the iMessage App
Store is smaller than the regular App Store, Together To Do has
achieved notable rankings and consistent organic downloads, suggesting
that iMessage extensions may be a viable niche.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOU'VE JUST INHERITED A LEGACY C++ CODEBASE, NOW WHAT? (16 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 When first starting work on a legacy C++ codebase, you should
prioritize making the codebase manageable in terms of security,
development experience, correctness, and performance by focusing on
small, incremental changes. Aim for a passing test suite, remove dead
code, enforce linters and code formatters, set up automated builds,
and clearly document how to build and test the project. It‚Äôs also
important to obtain buy-in from management by explaining the issues
with the codebase and proposing solutions in non-technical terms. 

 WHERE I‚ÄôM AT ON THE WHOLE CSS-TRICKS THING (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The founder of the CSS-Tricks website sold the website in March 2022
to DigitalOcean, who promptly fired the content team and stopped
publishing new content. He tried to regain control of CSS-Tricks and
proposed running the site himself, but DigitalOcean ultimately
declined the proposal due to a lack of internal support. Today,
CSS-Tricks remains in a somewhat abandoned state. 

 NOTES FROM ‚ÄúWHY CAN‚ÄôT WE MAKE SIMPLE SOFTWARE?‚Äù (3 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 It‚Äôs important to be ‚Äúscale appropriate‚Äù when architecting
software. Complexity multiplies with factors like supported browsers,
platforms, and screen sizes. The tools that worked previously may no
longer be suitable as you scale. Embrace the need to rebuild with new
tools to manage the increased complexity.

 HOW DO COMPANIES SHIP CODE TO PRODUCTION? (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The typical code deployment process for companies starts with
planning and development, where developers work in sprints while
product owners refine requirements as user stories. Automated systems
are then used to verify that the code passes tests. The code is
deployed to dev and QA environments for testing before being deployed
to production. 

 ON GETTING PAID FOR OPEN SOURCE (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Open source can be integrated into your job, but not every company
offers these roles. This author's open source work began as part of
their regular job, evolving into dedicated company time and side
consulting gigs. Despite various funding models, including
sponsorships and partnerships, they found it difficult to make a
living solely from open source outside of a company. 

 PREVENTING SQL INJECTION ATTACKS IN NODE.JS (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 SQL injection can occur when user input is used in SQL queries
without validation, allowing attackers to manipulate queries for
malicious purposes. To prevent SQL injection attacks, developers
should use query placeholders or prepared statements to ensure user
input is treated as data, not code. They should also validate and
sanitize user input to enforce format and character restrictions.
