ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 RUNNING PONG IN 240 BROWSER TABS (15 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This developer ran a Pong game across 240 browser tabs by using
favicons as pixels. Inspired by a favicon-based Flappy Bird, they used
AppleScript to create a grid of tabs and solved challenges like
favicon update throttling with web workers and tab synchronization
using broadcast channels. Careful measurements were needed to align
the canvas with the tab bar, which allowed the Pong game to smoothly
transition between the main canvas and the tab bar. 

 DESIGNING BACKGROUNDS WITH LLMS AND REACT (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 LLMs speed up the process of making beautiful, interactive website
backgrounds using React and Tailwind CSS. Some examples are shown
using gridlines, dotted patterns, and animated stars, all generated
using a few LLM prompts. It also helps that many LLMs are tuned to
produce React and Tailwind CSS code. 

 BUNDLING DEPENDENCIES (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bundling dependencies can help with compatibility, reducing bloat,
and making distribution simpler. However, it can hide dependency
issues, prevent updates, and remove the deduplication benefits that
npm provides. Generally, bundling makes sense for developer tools, but
should be avoided for libraries unless absolutely necessary.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 UGLY CODE AND DUMB THINGS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There's a tension between writing elegant, reusable code and building
quick, pragmatic solutions for users. Flamework, a pseudo-framework
from Flickr, is an example of prioritizing speed and scale over code
beauty, where "doing the dumbest possible thing that will work" can be
great for product iteration. Reusability is more necessary for
libraries and frameworks than applications. 

 APPEND-ONLY PROGRAMMING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Append-only programming is where code is appended to a single file,
and existing code is never edited. It's not practical for the real
world, but it can help enforce better coding practices, like small
functions, thinking about what code to write before committing it, and
writing more readable code. 

 I LIKE THE FUTURE OF NEXT.JS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The new granular caching system in Next.js with the "use cache"
directive at the file, component, and function levels makes Next.js
more pleasant to use. It's an improvement on the developer experience
and the end user's experience. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REACT NATIVE 0.78 (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 React Native 0.78 has been released, with React 19 integration and
various improvements. The main updates include native support for
Android XML drawables, streamlined React Compiler enablement, and
easier React Native integration in iOS through RCTReactNativeFactory.
The release also introduces an opt-in for JavaScript logs in Metro and
prepares for smaller, faster, and more frequent releases in 2025. 

 REACT BITS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 React Bits is a library of animated React components. It has over 60
components, including animations and backgrounds, available in
JavaScript or TypeScript with CSS or Tailwind CSS styling. 

 JETKVM (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 JetKVM is an open-source KVM over IP solution for managing computers
remotely. It has low-latency, high-FPS video and smooth keyboard/mouse
interaction. The software is written in Go and TypeScript,
customizable via SSH, and allows optional remote access.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING JOB OPENINGS HIT FIVE-YEAR LOW? (12 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 According to data from Indeed, software developer job postings have
declined a lot, reaching levels similar to those seen during the
mid-2020 pandemic period, and are down 35% since January 2020. While
the US accounting change Section 174 may have a small impact, the
trend is global. Potential reasons for the drop include increased
productivity through GenAI tools, a correction after the over-hiring
boom during the pandemic, and smaller, more efficient teams. 

 WHEN YOUR LAST NAME IS NULL, NOTHING WORKS (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 People with the last name Null have issues with online forms and
databases. Many systems interpret "Null" as an invalid entry or a
potential security threat, leading to errors and blocked processes.

READ) [15] 

 This is a CUDA programming guide for Python developers that explains
how GPUs use parallel processing to accelerate computations, how CUDA

 REACT "AS" PROP USING TYPESCRIPT (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 An “as” prop for React components can be implemented to
dynamically render different HTML tags while maintaining proper type
checking and autocompletion for the specific tag's properties. 

 CHECKBOX INTERACTIONS - THE BEAUTY OF LAYOUT ANIMATIONS (5 MINUTE
READ) [17]
