ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY REACT QUERY? (15 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 React Query is both a data fetcher and an asynchronous state manager
designed for handling server state. Unlike client state (managed with
useState or useReducer), server state is often asynchronous,
persistent, and can be modified by multiple users. React Query
abstracts common complexities like cache management, invalidation, and
refetching, allowing developers to focus on building their
applications without getting bogged down in the complex, nitty-gritty
details of data fetching. 

 WHY PATCHING GLOBALS IS HARMFUL (20 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Patching globals, or modifying existing APIs in a language, can lead
to maintenance issues, unpredictable behavior due to conflicting
implementations, vendor lock-in, and even slow down the progress of
the language itself. These issues arise because patched globals are
essentially modifications to code that you don't own, making them
difficult to manage and predict. There are often better, more explicit
solutions to API design challenges that avoid these issues.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO SALVAGE A "MICROSERVICE" SYSTEM BUILT THE WRONG WAY (REDDIT
THREAD) [6] 

 This author is part of a team that built microservices the ‚Äúwrong
way‚Äù where everything depends on everything else and thus it's too
difficult to make architectural changes. Commenters give their
recommendations, such as collapsing the system to an actual monolith
if possible and turning remote calls to local calls. 

 ASK HN: FOUNDERS WHO OFFER FREE/OS AND PAID SAAS, HOW DO YOU MANAGE
YOUR CODE? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [7] 

 Founders share how they manage code for their free and paid SaaS
products. Many products use a plug-in architecture, while others have
separate codebases for the open-source product versus the paid
product. 

 AT SOME POINT, JAVASCRIPT GOT GOOD (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 JavaScript has changed a lot since 2015, especially thanks to
improvements in the ECMAScript specification. Early JavaScript was
difficult to work with due to issues like function-scoped variables
and callback hell. Modern JavaScript has introduced features like
block-scoped variables, arrow functions, promises, and async/await,
which makes development much better. Tooling has also gotten better.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 üÜï SUPABASE + SENTRY (SPONSOR) [9] 

 If you're building on Supabase, the new Sentry integration [9] is a
powerful way to find slow queries and errors in your database. Join
Thorsten from Supabase and Lazar from Sentry for a live developer
workshop [9], where they'll demo the integration on a Next.js project.
Sign up for the session this Thursday! [9] 

 HELLO GPT-4O (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI has released GPT-4o, an AI model that can reason across audio,
vision, and text in real time. Developers can access the GPT-4o API as
a text and vision model. It's 2x faster, half the price, and has 5x
higher rate limits compared to GPT-4 Turbo. 

 GRAPHQL-REQUEST (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Graphql-request is a minimal GraphQL client that supports both Node
and browsers for scripts and simple apps. It has a Promise-based API
and first-class TypeScript support. 

 PINTORA (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Pintora is an extensible JavaScript text-to-diagrams library that
works in both browsers and Node.js.

MISCELLANEOUS

 INSIDE THE CULT OF THE HASKELL PROGRAMMER (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Haskell is a functional programming language with elegant syntax but
a steep learning curve. Although not widely adopted for practical
programming, Haskell has influenced modern programming languages, with
many incorporating its concepts to improve bug prevention, code
correctness, and parallel processing capabilities. 

 BINARY SEARCH VS. PROLLY SEARCH (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Binary Search is a common search algorithm with logarithmic time
complexity, often used on sorted data. Prolly Search is a faster
alternative that leverages the uniform distribution of data to make
more intelligent guesses than simply dividing the set in half with
each iteration. However, Prolly Search is not always applicable
because it relies on the assumption of uniform data distribution, and
it can regress to linear time complexity in certain cases. 

 GPUS GO BRRR (26 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 These authors, from Stanford University, focused on optimizing AI's
compute usage and developed ThunderKittens, a DSL embedded in CUDA, to
write efficient kernels. ThunderKittens simplifies the process of
utilizing hardware features like the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA)
and warp group matrix multiply accumulate (WGMMA) instructions,
leading to significant performance improvements in Flash Attention and
Based linear attention kernels.

 AMAZON S3 WILL NO LONGER CHARGE FOR SEVERAL HTTP ERROR CODES (1
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Amazon S3 is changing its billing policy so that bucket owners will
no longer be charged for unauthorized requests that return a 403
(Access Denied) error and other codes. 

 APPLE AND GOOGLE DELIVER SUPPORT FOR UNWANTED TRACKING ALERTS IN IOS
AND ANDROID (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Apple and Google have partnered to create a specification for
Bluetooth tracking devices that will send alerts to both iOS and
Android users if an unknown tracker is detected moving with them. 

 COLORANG! A (SLIGHTLY) NEW WAY TO VISUALIZE RGBA COLOR (4 MINUTE
READ) [18]
