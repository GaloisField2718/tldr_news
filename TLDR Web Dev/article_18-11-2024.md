ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE MADE A RUBY METHOD 200X FASTER (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A performance regression in Campsite's API was identified through
observability tools after code was refactored to transform rich text
into plain text and Markdown. Profiling revealed that the bottleneck
was the use of a certain node lookup. This was replaced with a more
efficient HANDLERS_BY_NODE_NAMES hash lookup, which reduced processing
time from 200ms to under 1ms. 

 THE PRACTICAL GUIDE TO SCALING DJANGO (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Common performance bottlenecks in Django include database queries,
template rendering, Python processing, cache misses, file I/O, and
network latency. This guide details optimization techniques for each
bottleneck, including database query optimization, caching strategies
(view-level, fragment, and low-level API), asynchronous operations,
background tasks, load balancing, and content delivery network (CDN)
usage. 

 OPTIMIZERS: THE LOW-KEY MVP (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 DuckDB's query optimizer improves query performance, often by orders
of magnitude, compared to both unoptimized and even hand-optimized
queries. This improvement stems from several optimization rules,
including filter pushdown, join order optimization, and TopN
optimization, which automatically adapts to changing data conditions.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GOOD SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT HABITS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This developer writes about a few software development habits that
have helped him write better software faster. They focus on writing
small commits frequently, refactoring continuously, and deploying
often. They also often write tests first to define API structures
early. 

 YOU CAN'T BUILD INTERACTIVE WEB APPS EXCEPT AS SINGLE PAGE
APPLICATIONS... AND OTHER MYTHS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Modern browsers, coupled with technologies like service workers and
the Speculation Rules API, significantly improve
Multi-Page-Application (MPA) performance, addressing issues like slow
page transitions and offline capabilities. Specific techniques, such
as caching strategies and Workbox for service worker automation, can
be used to make MPAs more efficient. Interactive web apps aren't only
for Single Page Applications (SPAs). 

 WILL WE CARE ABOUT FRAMEWORKS IN THE FUTURE? (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI agents will make traditional frameworks and architectural patterns
obsolete as LLMs generate increasingly independent, vanilla code.

running at 120FPS while sorting, filtering, and scrolling
simultaneously. 

 LITERAL (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Literal is a Ruby runtime type checker that provides types,
structured objects, properties, and enums. Its built-in types include
generic structures that enable some cool use cases like checking an
array is all integers.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY DID WINDOWS 95 SETUP USE THREE OPERATING SYSTEMS? (5 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Windows 95's setup process utilized three operating systems (MS-DOS,
Windows 3.1, and Windows 95) to handle upgrades from various starting
points. Instead of creating three separate setup programs, developers
cleverly designed a chained system using an MS-DOS program to install
a minimal Windows 3.1 version, followed by a 16-bit Windows program
for core setup tasks, and finally a 32-bit Windows 95 program for
final configurations, which minimized code duplication. 

 HOW A BBC NAVIGATION BAR COMPONENT BROKE DEPENDING ON WHICH EXTERNAL
MONITOR IT WAS ON (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A bug on the BBC website's ‘More' button occurred only on external
monitors positioned above the main screen due to issues with negative
screen coordinates in Chrome and Firefox. The fix involved updating
the event handler to check for both positive and negative screenX and
screenY values. 

 YC IS WRONG ABOUT LLMS FOR CHIP DESIGN (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 LLMs produce mediocre Verilog code and cannot design novel chip
architectures, unlike skilled engineers. While LLMs can reduce chip
design costs, benefiting large companies and potentially smaller
startups by enabling leaner teams, they won't create significantly
superior chips or open new markets.

QUICK LINKS

 REVERSE ENGINEERING IOS 18 INACTIVITY REBOOT (17 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 iOS 18 introduces an inactivity reboot feature that automatically
restarts the device after 72 hours of inactivity, requiring any
attacker to have kernel-level access within that timeframe to bypass
data encryption. 

 MAP MATRIX (GITHUB REPO) [20] 

 Map Matrix is a React application for comparing multiple maps
simultaneously. 

 YOU CAN GROW YOUR DEVELOPER INTUITION (6 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Software development is an artistic endeavor that relies heavily on
developer intuition, which can be cultivated through deliberate
practice, pattern recognition training, experiential learning, and
reflection.
