ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE WEB'S CLIPBOARD, AND HOW IT STORES DATA OF DIFFERENT TYPES (20
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Clipboard API restricts the data types that can be written to the
clipboard. While the Clipboard Events API allows for arbitrary data
types, it can only be used in user-triggered events. This article goes
into the creative solutions employed by web applications like Google
Docs and Figma to overcome these limitations, such as by using custom
data types and base64 encoding for transmitting information. 

 IMPLEMENTING REACT FROM SCRATCH (26 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article details the process of building a React-like library
from scratch, providing insights into its internal workings and design
decisions. It starts by implementing a core rendering model, including
components, virtual DOM, and reconciliation, showing how React
constructs and updates the UI. It then goes into the implementation of
essential hooks like `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, and `useMemo`.
Finally, the article discusses the implementation of `useCallback` and
`useContext`, showing off the challenges and solutions involved in
managing state and context sharing within a component tree. 

 JAVASCRIPT GENERATORS EXPLAINED, BUT ON A SENIOR-LEVEL (8 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Generators in JavaScript are special functions that allow you to
pause and resume execution, making them ideal for controlling when
data is processed. They are especially useful for handling large
datasets, asynchronous tasks, and complex iteration patterns.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FOUNDER MODE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Traditional management techniques for scaling startups are
fundamentally flawed and detrimental to founder-led success. This post
highlights Brian Chesky's experience at Airbnb, where following
conventional wisdom led to disastrous results, prompting him to
develop a new approach. This new approach, "founder mode," is
characterized by closer engagement with the company, even at the
detail level, and a willingness to break conventional norms. 

 WILLINGNESS TO LOOK STUPID (29 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Often, people think they are stupid for asking certain questions.
They shouldn't mind this, because they should prioritize learning and
understanding over appearances. This willingness to ask seemingly
"stupid" questions leads to deeper comprehension in the long run. 

 SHOULD YOU BECOME AN ENGINEERING MANAGER? (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The choice between becoming a manager or staying as an individual
contributor depends on your career goals and strengths. Managers focus
on people management and team impact but have less control over their
career growth, while ICs have more autonomy and career mobility.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 üêõ DEBUGGING NEXT.JS TO SLASH API LOAD TIMES (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Tired of staring at logs and opaque dashboards? There's an easier way
to fix API bugs and performance issues. Join Dan Mindru (Morning Maker
co-host) for a live coding session to see how he shaved off 22.3s of
load time [11] using Sentry's Tracing and Session Replay. Submit your
questions ahead of time! [10] 

 BLOCKS.MD (WEBSITE) [12] 

 blocks.md is a tool that takes your Markdown files and turns them
into forms and web pages that are customizable, accessible, and fully
localizable. 

 QRSVG (WEBSITE) [13] 

 QRSVG is a small JavaScript project that renders two-dimensional
bitmasks (mostly assumed to be QR codes) into SVG elements with a
collection of SVG paths with defined purposes. 

 ALGORA TV (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Algora TV is an interactive livestreaming and video sharing service
for developers. It's like an open-source Twitch.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOING FAST SLOWLY (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Despite the Varnish cache project having over 150,000 lines of code,
the average productivity of the two main developers of the project
over ten years is estimated at only 5 lines per hour. This low
productivity is a result of prioritizing quality and correctness over
speed, as shown by extensive testing, meticulous code style, and a
focus on avoiding errors. The lack of user complaints about Varnish
suggests that this approach has successfully achieved its goal of
producing high-quality software. 

 EXTREME PI BOOT OPTIMIZATION (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article goes over a developer's journey in optimizing the boot
time of a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W for a solar-powered WiFi camera. The
goal was to minimize energy consumption by reducing both the boot time
and the power draw during boot. Various hardware and software
techniques were explored, including disabling unnecessary components,
adjusting kernel settings, and creating a custom Buildroot system with
a stripped-down kernel. By implementing these optimizations, the boot
time was reduced from over 12 seconds to less than 3.5 seconds,
resulting in a fivefold reduction in energy consumption. 

 THE CONTINGENCY CONTINGENT: MY FAKE JOB IN Y2K PREPAREDNESS (36
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In 1998, the author of this essay worked on a Y2K (the Year 2000 bug)
preparedness project for a global advertising conglomerate. The
project involved documenting the company's technological inventory and
making sure it was ready for Y2K. Eventually, they realized the
project was largely a sham designed to protect the company from
potential legal liabilities.

 IS MY VISION THAT BAD? NO, IT'S JUST A BUG IN APPLE'S CALCULATOR (5
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 There is a bug in Apple's Calculator app where some digits in the
binary display are misaligned by one pixel, likely due to a rounding
error. 

 AI DEVELOPMENT AND AGILE DON'T MIX WELL, STUDY SHOWS (6 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Traditional agile software development practices are ill-suited for
AI projects, leading to frequent failures - prioritize open
communication between technical teams and business stakeholders for
success instead. 

 STATICRYPT (GITHUB REPO) [20] 

 StatiCrypt allows you to encrypt and password protect the content of
public static HTML files, to be decrypted in-browser without any
back-end, and serve it over static hosting like Netlify, GitHub pages,
etc. 

 BUILDING LLMS FROM THE GROUND UP: A 3-HOUR CODING WORKSHOP (2 MINUTE
READ) [21] 

 Building LLMs from the Ground Up is a 3-hour coding workshop on
building LLMs from scratch and understanding tokenization,
pretraining, finetuning, and more.
