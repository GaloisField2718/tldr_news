ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MODERN CSS - SPRING 2024 EDITION (22
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This guide lists all the new additions to CSS, like nesting,
container queries, view transitions, and :has(). Each feature comes
with an explainer, demo, code example, and a quick bit of detail as to
why you should care about them. 

 HOW UBER OPTIMIZED THEIR HADOOP CLUSTERS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Uber faced challenges with its massive HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File
System) deployment, which was lowering the efficiency of its clusters.
To fix this, its team modified settings to increase data transfer
rates and parallelism. They also improved its HDFS Balancer algorithm
to prioritize data movement to the least utilized nodes and use
percentiles instead of fixed thresholds for better target selection.
This led to much better cluster utilization and efficiency. 

 `ANY` CONSIDERED HARMFUL, EXCEPT FOR THESE CASES (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Use of the ‚Äúany‚Äù type is discouraged because it disables
TypeScript's safety features, making code prone to errors and harder
to maintain. However, there are some cases where using ‚Äúany‚Äù is
the right solution. It should be used in arguments when defining
generic functions that should work with any function type. "any" can
also be used with type assertions to work around TypeScript's
limitations to accurately model functions that return different types
based on input.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE ONE ABOUT THE WEB DEVELOPER JOB MARKET (26 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The web developer job market is in a rough condition and likely to
worsen. Mass layoffs are happening despite a supposed AI boom. If the
bubble bursts, the job market will further decline. The stock market
has been rewarding layoffs and activist investors want to lower
developer pay. LLMs enable faster development with fewer developers,
if you don't care about software quality. 

 HOW TO CONVERT YOUR YEARLY REVIEW TO A PROMOTION IN BIG TECH (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To maximize your promotion chances, maintain a "brag document" of
accomplishments, seek regular feedback, and understand your manager's
style to properly ‚Äúmanage up‚Äù. During annual reviews, write a
concise, value-driven, and impact-focused self-review. 

 IS EUROPE BETTER THAN AMERICA FOR WORKING IN TECH? (8 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Europe offers a superior working environment for tech professionals
compared to the United States. Europeans enjoy shorter work weeks,
more vacation time, and benefit from a cultural emphasis on leisure.
Europe's public transit systems offer convenient commutes and
intercity travel compared to car-dependent US cities.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DIGITAL WALLETS AND THE ‚ÄúONLY APPLE PAY DOES THIS‚Äù MYTHOLOGY (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple Pay (and other digital wallets) use DPANs (Device Primary
Account Numbers) instead of actual credit card numbers (FPAN) to
protect customer information and reduce cross-merchant tracking. While
DPANs change for different merchants, they remain the same for
subsequent transactions with the same merchant. Apple Pay technically
doesn't completely prevent individual stores from tracking your
purchase history. It doesn't hide personal information, and merchants
can still collect details like names, addresses, and product
information for order fulfillment. 

 INVESTING IN INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION: A BRICK-BY-BRICK GUIDE FOR
STARTUPS (22 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Startups often neglect internal documentation. This can lead to lost
knowledge and worse efficiency during crises. The problem worsens as
companies grow. To fix this problem, startups need to change their
documentation culture. Leaders should set the standard and
documentation should be expected in role profiles. Docs should be
properly organized and owned by people or teams.
