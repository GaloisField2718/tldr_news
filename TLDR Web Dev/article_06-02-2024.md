ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE INCREASED SEARCH TRAFFIC BY 20X IN 4 MONTHS WITH THE NEXT.JS
APP ROUTER (21 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Properly optimizing a Next.js web application can lead to much faster
load times, and thus, much better search traffic from Google. Some of
the techniques that can be used to speed up a Next.js web app include
using server-side rendering as much as possible, fetching server-side
and hydrating client-side, bootstrapping the most important data,
creating ghost components, removing excess providers, and optimizing
font loading. This post goes deep into the technical aspects of each
of these techniques, providing detailed images, explanations, and code
examples. 

 REDUCING BIGQUERY COSTS BY 260X (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Implementing clustering in large tables can help reduce BigQuery
costs significantly. This article provides an example of a MERGE query
and compares the costs and performance between clustered and
unclustered tables. The results show that clustering can lead to a
260x reduction in data processed, 20x lower slot time, and 268x lower
costs. 

 WHY DOES GOOGLE RECOMMEND MODULAR MONOLITHS INSTEAD OF MICROSERVICES?
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A recent Google paper found that most of its developers split
binaries for one of the following reasons: performance improvements,
fault tolerance, abstraction boundaries, and/or flexible rollouts. The
paper recommends developers use modular monoliths to write
applications and leverage a runtime to dynamically and automatically
assign components to physical processes. This approach has worked for
Google: it reduces application latency by up to 15x and costs by up to
9x.

 VESUVIUS CHALLENGE 2023 GRAND PRIZE AWARDED: WE CAN READ THE FIRST
SCROLL! (18 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Vesuvius Challenge asked people to use AI to read an ancient
library of papyrus scrolls that are now stored in Naples, Italy. The
scrolls are rolled up and practically lumps of carbonized ash, so they
cannot be opened without being severely damaged. A team of three won
the prize of $700k for being able to read 5% of the scroll. There are
now multiple new challenges and 6-figure dollar amounts available in
prizes to continue reading the rest of the scroll. So far, the scroll
talks philosophically about pleasure and how to enjoy life. 

 MAKING A PDF THAT‚ÄôS LARGER THAN GERMANY (9 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A couple of years back, a tweet claimed that the maximum size of a
PDF is half of Germany. This post dives into this claim and proves how
big PDFs can actually be. It also explains the inner structure of PDFs
and how you can change page sizes. Most PDF sizes are limited only by
the PDF reader and not the PDF itself. Turns out, the biggest size of
a PDF is 15 million inches, or roughly the distance of Earth to the
moon.
