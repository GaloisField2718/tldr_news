 THE FUTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION (AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT) ISN'T IN THE
CLASSROOM (SPONSOR) [4] 

 A high-quality Master's degree is a major advantage in the
increasingly crowded job market—but that doesn't mean packing your
bags, putting your life on pause, and spending $100K+ on traditional
universities.

Quantic's online Master of Science in Software Engineering (MSSE) [4]
is selective, flexible, and radically affordable—offering
world-leading training in ML integration, AI engineering, and cloud
architecture, with a unique mobile-first approach that fits your
schedule.

“This is the future of education: engaging and on-demand. Quantic's
network competes with and beats most Ivy League schools.” —
Quantic alumnus Marek Szeles, software engineer and Founder/Director @
AI for Sustainable Energy Research

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DON'T ANIMATE HEIGHT! (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A note-taking app had high CPU and GPU usage due to a CSS animation
affecting the height property of a visualizer. Animating the height
property triggers expensive layout and paint recalculations in the
browser's rendering pipeline. Replacing the height animation with a
transform animation, specifically using two rectangles with translate
transformations instead of scaleY, drastically reduces CPU and GPU
usage. 

 I WROTE A WASM INTERPRETER IN C (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This developer spent six months building a WebAssembly (Wasm)
interpreter in C as a learning project to deepen their understanding
of low-level computing. In this post, they explain the evolution of
Wasm and its applications in web and cloud environments, such as
in-browser compilation. They then walk through the interpreter's
implementation, covering module decoding, function invocation, and
execution via an opcode switch loop. 

 WHAT OKTA BCRYPT INCIDENT CAN TEACH US ABOUT DESIGNING BETTER APIS
(16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Okta Bcrypt incident exposed a vulnerability where excessively
long usernames allowed authentication bypass due to the 72-character
input limit of the Bcrypt algorithm, leading to ignored password data.
Through testing various implementations in Go, Java, JavaScript, and
Python, the blog post shows that while some libraries enforce this
limitation correctly (like Go's and Patrick Favre's Java Bcrypt),
others fail to do so (such as Spring Security and bcryptjs).

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOPICS I'VE CHANGED MY MIND ON AFTER 10 YEARS IN
THE INDUSTRY (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A software dev reflects on their decade in the industry, revisiting
opinions they had written down in the past. For example, contrary to
their past beliefs, they now believe that DynamoDB is a good database,
typed languages are essential, and that simplicity is not a given.
Some earlier beliefs still hold though, such as skepticism on code
style obsession, microservices, and the necessity of project managers.


 DEVELOPER PHILOSOPHY (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Some key dev philosophies to follow include the importance of
avoiding ground-up rewrites by managing technical debt early,
recognizing that the last 10% of a project often takes as much effort
as the first 90%, and automating good practices to enforce
consistency. Devs also need to account for edge cases, simplify code
when possible, and write testable, obviously correct code rather than
relying on implicit correctness. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GOOSE (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Goose is an open-source, local AI agent that automates engineering
tasks, allowing devs to focus on higher-level work. It's effective for
tasks like debugging, data generation, code migration, and custom CLI
command creation. 

 HTTPTAP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Httptap is a Linux tool that allows users to view the HTTP and HTTPS
requests made by any program by running httptap -- `command`. It works
by running the given command in an isolated network namespace and
transparently proxying the traffic.

 BEYOND THE AI MVP: WHAT IT REALLY TAKES (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Most AI companies are stuck in the experimental phase and lack proper
eval tools to measure and improve model performance. The “AI MVP
trap” misleads teams into thinking an impressive prototype is nearly
complete, when in reality, building a good AI product requires
extensive eval suites and automated testing. 

 THE DUMB REASON WHY FLAG EMOJIS AREN'T WORKING ON YOUR SITE IN CHROME
ON WINDOWS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Flag emojis don't render properly in Chrome on Windows because
Microsoft's system font doesn't support them, likely due to
geopolitical concerns. As a result, Chrome users see country code
letters (e.g., "GB" instead of 🇬🇧), while Firefox avoids the
issue by using its own emoji font. 

 INSIDE IMESSAGE-EXPORTER: REVERSE ENGINEERING APPLE'S TYPEDSTREAM
FORMAT (34 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A developer reverse-engineered Apple's undocumented typedstream
binary serialization format used in iMessage's attributedBody BLOB,
which stores rich text and formatting data. In this post, they explain
how they deciphered the format's structure, including type tags,
indicators, and object caching, to create imessage-exporter, a tool
that can extract and represent this data in a platform-agnostic way.

QUICK LINKS

 A COMPUTER CAN NEVER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A 1979 IBM internal training document stated that "a computer can
never be held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a
management decision,” which is very relevant in the age of AI. 

 I CONDITIONED MYSELF TO FAIL (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A developer describes a pattern of losing interest in projects after
launch due to an addiction to the dopamine rush of information and
feedback during the building process. 

 REVERSE ENGINEERING: I FOUND A GAME EXPLOIT THAT LETS HACKERS TAKE
OVER YOUR PC (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A security researcher discovered a dangerous Remote Code Execution
exploit in the game Marvel Rivals that could allow attackers on the
same network to take over other players' PCs.
