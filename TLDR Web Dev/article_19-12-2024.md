ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 INTRODUCING TANSTACK START (19 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 TanStack Start is a new meta-framework that adds a thin server layer
to TanStack Router, enabling server-side rendering without sacrificing
Router's functionality. Unlike other meta-frameworks, Start avoids
performance issues by using isomorphic loaders, which run on both the
server (for initial load) and the client (for subsequent navigations),
using client-side state and caching. This approach solves the
"impedance mismatch" between server-side data loading and client-side
state management, preventing unnecessary data refetches. 

 OPTIMIZING RUBY'S JSON, PART 1 (17 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This developer improved the performance of Ruby's json gem, making it
the fastest JSON parser and generator in many benchmarks. These
improvements actually weren't that complex, as most of them came from
simple optimizations discovered through profiling and focusing on
areas like redundant UTF-8 checks and inefficient buffer allocation. 

 HOW WE THINK ABOUT THREADS' IOS PERFORMANCE (18 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Threads iOS team prioritized performance to maintain a positive
user experience during the app's rapid growth, tracking key metrics
like image load times (%FIRE), content delivery speed (TTNC), and post
success rate (cPSR). They reduced app size, used a new latency
measurement tool (SLATE), and implemented features like Drafts for
better reliability. A boundary test revealed the negative impact of
navigation latency on user engagement, highlighting the importance of
quick loading times.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 A SIMPLE PROGRAMMING PRODUCTIVITY TRICK: LEAVE WORK UNFINISHED TO
REACH FLOW (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Leave work slightly unfinished in order to reach a productive “flow
state” easier the next day. Learn keyboard and mouse shortcuts,
maintain a list of common commands and references, and learn to say
“no” more often. This includes saying “no” both in terms of
choosing technology and tasks that align with your goals and
priorities 

 MENTORING SOFTWARE ENGINEERS OR ENGINEERING LEADERS (18 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Mentoring is valuable for professional growth. A few different
approaches to finding mentors include seeking internal mentors at
large companies, considering paid coaches for engineering leaders at
smaller companies, and connecting with experienced individuals both
in-person and online. Mentoring doesn't have to be formal and
structured, as even informal mentorship can be valuable and initiated
by simply asking someone you admire for their time and advice.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ANNOUNCING 150M DEVELOPERS AND A NEW FREE TIER FOR GITHUB COPILOT IN
VS CODE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 GitHub Copilot is now available for free with limited features. The
free tier has 2,000 completions per month in VSCode and 50 chat
messages per month. 

 MUSOQ (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Musoq is an open-source project that provides SQL-like querying
capabilities for data sources like files, databases, and APIs without
the need for a traditional database. It's designed for efficient
ad-hoc querying of smaller to medium-sized datasets and has plugins
for various data sources (filesystem, Git, JSON, AI models, etc.). 

 BASE UI (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Base UI is a set of 25 unstyled React components that are easily
installable via npm. They can be animated using CSS transitions, CSS
animations, or JavaScript animation libraries.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE RAM MYTH (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The article challenges the common misconception that modern computer
memory behaves like ideal random-access memory, arguing that this
assumption leads to inefficient data sharding algorithms. For large
datasets, a seemingly slower algorithm using radix sort, which
prioritizes ordered memory access, outperforms the standard approach.
This improvement is from reducing cache misses, shown by code examples
and benchmarks that demonstrate speedups from 2.5x to 9x. 

 JAVA IN THE SMALL (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Java can be used for small programming tasks, as recent language
features have improved its suitability for scripting. Modern Java
allows for launching `.java` files directly without explicit
compilation or JAR creation. Java's standard library lacks JSON and
command-line processing - tools like JBang and third-party libraries
can help with this.

QUICK LINKS

 5 TIPS TO EFFECTIVELY OPTIMIZE INP IN REACT (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Five tips for optimizing Interaction to Next Paint (INP) in React
apps include reducing DOM size, dividing components into simple and
extended versions, using `Suspense`, avoiding hydration errors, and
carefully managing `useEffect` hooks. 

 ASSISTANT UI (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Assistant UI is an open-source React component library for building
AI chat interfaces, supporting various AI models. 

 APPLE WATCH WITH ANDROID (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Someone successfully used open-source software and interoperable
protocols to connect an Apple Watch to their Android phone, bypassing
the need for an iPhone for most functions. 

 12 MODERN CSS ONE-LINE UPGRADES (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 12 modern CSS properties that can make your life easier, such as
stable upgrades like aspect-ratio and object-fit, stable enhancements
like text-underline-offset and outline-offset, and progressive
enhancements such as overscroll-behavior and scrollbar-gutter. 

 APPLE COLLABORATES WITH NVIDIA TO RESEARCH FASTER LLM PERFORMANCE (2
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Apple and NVIDIA collaborated to integrate Apple's ReDrafter
technology into NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM, resulting in a 2.7x speedup in
large language model text generation on NVIDIA GPUs.
