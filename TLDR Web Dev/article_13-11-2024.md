 5 NON-LLM SOFTWARE TRENDS TO BE EXCITED ABOUT (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Innovations like local-first software, automated reasoning, and
advancements in cross-platform development are trends that are quietly
leading to better developer and user experiences. For example, Notion
was able to improve its web app performance by over 20% by using
SQLite in browser, which is a combination of the SQLite, WebAssembly,
and local-first software trends. 

 HOW WE BUILT THE BFCM 2023 GLOBE (29 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Shopify built an interactive 3D globe visualization for its Black
Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) event in 2023. This article dives into the
engineering challenges and solutions used to optimize performance,
particularly in instancing and GPU-based animation. It goes through
the creation of various elements, such as arcs representing orders,
city dots, fireworks, and animated pins, with the use of Three.js,
React-three-fiber, and psrdnoise for noise generation. 

 HOW REDDIT BUILT A METADATA STORE THAT HANDLES 100K READS PER SECOND
(6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Reddit built a unified metadata store using AWS Aurora Postgres to
handle over 100k reads per second for its massive user base. Postgres
was chosen over Cassandra since it was easier for querying, debugging,
and managing data relationships. To scale, Reddit used table
partitioning and JSONB denormalization, achieving low-latency reads
without needing a read-through cache.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT I WISH SOMEONE TOLD ME ABOUT POSTGRES (22 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This is a collection of tips and advice for working with Postgres
databases. It covers how to improve psql usage, optimize queries, and
understand the impact of locks and JSONB on application performance.
It is important to normalize data and follow the recommendations of
the Postgres developers. 

 THE SLOW DEATH OF THE HANDS-ON ENGINEERING MANAGER (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Many engineering managers stop coding as they take on more meetings
and management duties and gradually lose the habit. Managers can still
write some code by choosing small, impactful tasks that aren't in the
critical path of important projects. This benefits their team and
helps keep their skills sharp. 

 IS CODE AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY? (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Code is an asset, but each line of code creates a maintenance
liability, which if not managed properly, can lead to decreased
productivity and eventually a cycle of technical debt.

 THE LONG CONTEXT RAG CAPABILITIES OF OPENAI O1 AND GOOGLE GEMINI (14
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This blog post presents a benchmark of long context Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities for OpenAI's o1 models and
Google's Gemini 1.5 models. OpenAI's o1 models outperform other models
on long context RAG benchmarks up to 128,000 tokens, while Google's
Gemini 1.5 models maintain consistent performance at extremely long
contexts up to 2 million tokens, albeit with lower overall accuracy. 

 FROM GLSL TO WGSL: THE FUTURE OF SHADERS ON THE WEB (10 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 This article compares the new WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL) with the
established GLSL. WGSL seems to be the future of shaders on the web,
especially with the upcoming release of WebGPU. It introduces new
features like explicit types, struct declarations, and function
declarations that follow Rust conventions, which allows it to be more
robust overall. 

 DIMINISHING RETURNS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Increased effort doesn't always lead to proportional results in
complex systems. Adding more developers to a project or adding
features to a product doesn't always lead to increased efficiency or
user satisfaction. Instead, try new approaches and recognize that past
successes may not guarantee future success. This can help move things
forward in ways that combat diminishing returns.
