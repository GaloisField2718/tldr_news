ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW CONDITIONAL BREAKPOINTS WORK (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Conditional breakpoints are often avoided due to their slow
performance, even in modern debuggers like Visual Studio and raddbg,
which can take seconds to evaluate simple loops. The primary reason
for this slowness is the necessity for the debugger to stop and
evaluate the condition each time the breakpoint is hit, causing a lot
of overhead, especially in tight loops. Debuggers use methods like JIT
compilation and in-process agents to handle the condition evaluation
more efficiently, but these approaches still involve notable
complexity and performance costs. 

 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RUNNING POSTGRES FOR YOURSELF AND FOR OTHERS (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Running PostgreSQL for others requires additional steps compared to
running it for yourself, such as installing extensions, creating
server certificates, configuring settings, and creating DNS records.
Faster provisioning happens thanks to optimizations like using a baked
OS image, parallelizing steps, and creating a pool of pre-provisioned
databases. High Availability involves provisioning primary and standby
databases, regular health checks, and ensuring proper fencing of the
primary in case of failure. 

 COUNTING BYTES FASTER THAN YOU'D THINK POSSIBLE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This author participated in a coding challenge to count the
occurrences of a specific byte in a large stream of data and found
that interleaving the processing of successive 4K pages significantly
improved the performance by utilizing the Streamer prefetcher in the
Intel processor.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 COPYING IS THE WAY DESIGN WORKS (24 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Copying is a fundamental aspect of design, as shown by the Eames
chair, Steve Jobs' Apple products, and John Carmack's video games.
Copying can be a way to learn, a challenge to overcome, or a source of
new ideas. Some people have used copying to improve themselves, build
community, or subvert authority, while others have struggled against
it. 

 DEAR AWS, PLEASE LET ME BE A CLOUD ENGINEER AGAIN (4 MINUTE READ) [8]


 AWS' focus on Generative AI has overshadowed its traditional core
services like infrastructure and databases. This shift in priorities
is alienating developers who value the foundational aspects of AWS. 

 ASK HN: IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE FAANG SALARIES WITHOUT WORKING THERE?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [9] 

 There are FAANG-level salaries available in finance, trading, crypto,
and high-growth startups.

 PAPERMARK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Papermark is an open-source document sharing solution with built-in
analytics and custom domains. 

 WHY-IS-NODE-RUNNING (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 why-is-node-running is a tool that helps identify the active handles
keeping a Node.js process running by logging them. It can be installed
locally or globally and used either as a dependency in your code or as
a standalone CLI tool.

 1-BIT LLMS COULD SOLVE AI'S ENERGY DEMANDS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 LLMs demand a lot of energy, but researchers are finding ways to
reduce their size by quantization - representing model parameters with
only 1 or -1. The two main approaches are post-training quantization
(PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). PTQ is currently more
popular. Despite lower perplexity scores, 1-bit LLMs are much more
energy efficient and faster on customized chips. 

 THE ELEGANCE OF THE ASCII TABLE (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 ASCII is a standard for representing characters with 7-bit binary
values. It is the most popular character encoding format. ASCII uses a
well-organized table with control codes, space, numbers, shifted
numbers, and letters that all follow logical patterns. The table's
design is aesthetically pleasing and reflects a hidden history of
computing, with historical artifacts like the DEL character and the
placement of the space character showcasing consideration for sorting
and readability.
