ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 AN INTRO TO DEEPSEEK'S DISTRIBUTED FILE SYSTEM (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 DeepSeek's open-source distributed file system is called 3FS
(Fire-Flyer File System). 3FS abstracts away the complexities of
distributed storage, allowing users to interact with files as if they
were on a local system. The system uses meta, management, storage, and
client nodes, and has something called CRAQ that achieves strong
consistency with fault tolerance by treating nodes as a chain. 

 A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT HOW WE RELEASE THE SPOTIFY APP (11 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Spotify releases its mobile app weekly with hundreds of changes for
over 675 million users. Its Release team oversees this process,
balancing speed and quality with the help of tools and a dedicated
Release Manager. This manager coordinates communication, prioritizes
bug fixes, and helps with smooth feature rollouts. 

 AVOID THE STATE SYNCHRONIZATION TRAP (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A common issue faced in frontend state management is the
synchronization of related states like columns and filters in a data
table UI. This article walks through several flawed
approaches—direct setters, gate setters, and useEffect—and
ultimately recommends deriving shared state through selectors to avoid
duplication, glitches, and refetches. State should be shaped so that
dependencies are implicit and managed reactively, not manually.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE POST-DEVELOPER ERA (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Two years after predicting that AI would augment rather than replace
developers, Josh Comeau reaffirms that human devs are still necessary
for coding. Tools like Cursor and Claude Sonnet have made coding
easier and faster, but still require skilled oversight and guidance. 

 (ALL) DATABASES ARE JUST FILES. POSTGRES TOO (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Understanding PostgreSQL as a system of files, processes, and
configurations makes understanding databases easier. Devs get more
control over the database by manually setting up PostgreSQL instead of
relying on package managers or Docker, making debugging, provisioning,
and versioning easier. 

 PAIR PROGRAMMERS UNITE (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Mandatory pair programming can shield devs from harmful individual
metric tracking and micromanagement. By restructuring task management
systems to assign tickets to pairs or groups, individual
accountability is removed, so arbitrary metrics to track
"productivity" are meaningless.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GEMINI 2.5 FLASH (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google is releasing an early version of Gemini 2.5 Flash, its new AI
model, which has improved reasoning capabilities while maintaining
speed and cost-efficiency. The model uses a hybrid reasoning approach,
allowing devs to control the "thinking" process and set a thinking
budget to balance quality, cost, and latency. Gemini 2.5 Flash can
perform complex tasks more accurately by reasoning through thoughts
before responding. 

 FONT TESTER (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Font Tester is a browser extension that makes typography selection
and testing on any website easier by providing live previews, a font
library, custom font uploads, and comparison tools. 

 REACT AGENT HOOKS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 React Agent Hooks is a library that transforms React hooks into LLM
tools, letting devs create AI agents that can interact with and modify
application state through familiar React semantics. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 SQLITE TRANSACTIONS AND VIRTUAL TABLES (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SQLite provides transactional integrity when using virtual tables,
which allow accessing external data sources as if they were regular
tables. It uses rollback journals and super-journals to maintain
atomicity across multiple databases or virtual tables. It also has a
two-phase commit process, with an `xSync` hook for durability and
hooks `xCommit` and `xRollback` for cleanup. 

 IS REACT ACCESSIBLE? THAT'S THE WRONG QUESTION (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Many developers ask if React is accessible, but a better question is
whether React makes building accessible apps easier or harder. React
itself doesn't prevent accessibility, but common developer habits,
like overusing div elements, misusing ARIA, and poor SPA focus
management, usually lead to inaccessible experiences.

QUICK LINKS

 AGENTAPI (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 AgentAPI is an HTTP API that allows programmatic control of coding
agents like Claude Code, Goose, Aider, and Codex, enabling the
creation of unified chat interfaces, agent-to-agent control systems,
and automated pull request review tools. 

 BUILDING A RESILIENT DNS CLIENT FOR WEB-SCALE INFRASTRUCTURE (12
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 LinkedIn built a DNS Caching Layer that improves the reliability,
scalability, and visibility of DNS resolution within its web-scale
infrastructure. 

 SIZE MATTER (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Configuring PostgreSQL's `shared_buffers` is good for performance, as
it manages data flow, but setting it too large (beyond 64GB) relative
to the data area can lead to performance issues due to slow buffer
eviction processes. 

 STAFF+ SELF-ONBOARDING QUESTIONS (23 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Newly hired Staff+ engineers can properly onboard themselves by
asking thoughtful, collaborative questions focused on understanding
technology, product, operations, and people.
