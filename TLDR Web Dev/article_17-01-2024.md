 CLOUDFLARE WORKSHOP: REACT SERVER COMPONENTS (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Exploring React Server Components (RSCs)? This new server-first
paradigm [5] is tricky ‚Äî but it can help you significantly improve
developer experience and app performance.
Join Cloudflare‚Äôs free, half-day workshop [5] to understand RSCs
work behind-the-scenes, and how you can use them in your day-to-day
dev work. You‚Äôll also gain insight into new deployment patterns made
possible by innovations in the platform space.

By the end of the workshop you‚Äôll have built an app using RSCs and
Cloudflare‚Äôs new Smart Placement technology [5], and deployed it
onto the Developer Platform along with a serverless SQL database.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 MEASURING DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY: REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES (20 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Tech companies like Google and LinkedIn measure developer
productivity in different ways. Common metrics in the industry that
are commonly tracked as proxies for productivity are ease of delivery,
experiment velocity, and the stability of services and apps. However,
quantitative metrics alone can‚Äôt describe the full picture. Teams
should start with defining specific goals and problems first, then
pick the right quantitative and qualitative metrics for those goals. 

 ARCHITECTING A LIVE LOOK AT RELIABILITY: STRIPE'S VIRAL BLACK FRIDAY
SITE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Stripe built a real-time microsite for Black Friday and Cyber Monday
in 2023 to provide detailed insights into its core business using
Vercel. The microsite displayed Stripe's reliability, transaction
volumes, and global activity during this period. The company used
Next.js, SWR, and ISR to create the site fast, and it used strategies
like Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR) and Incremental Static Regeneration
(ISR) to manage real-time data and interactions while minimizing
backend queries.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO CRAFT THE PERFECT DATA ENGINEER RESUME AND LINKEDIN PROFILE IN
2024 (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To make your LinkedIn profile better, you should have a high-quality
profile picture and a detailed skills list. To stand out and build a
stronger LinkedIn network, developers should engage with others and
connect with people through direct messages. For the resume, one
should focus on describing their measurable impacts at their job and
showcase achievements. 

 I REGRET SELLING MY STARTUP (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This author sold his successful startup because he was seeking
freedom from certain aspects of the business. However, after the sale,
he found himself lost. He started having trouble with his sense of
self and purpose. Now, he recommends people to understand their
motivations and values when starting something.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ENTERPRISE-GRADE API MOCKING - FOR FREE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 When your code has a lot of API dependencies,¬†flexible and reliable
API mocking [11]¬†becomes crucial. Companies like Ingenico, IBM, and
BiltCard use¬†WireMock Cloud [11]¬†to simulate real-world API
scenarios (including edge cases and faults), test and deploy new code,
and seamlessly move to production when the API is ready.
Start mocking for free with just your GitHub account or email [11]

 TINYBENCH (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Tinybench is a small, lightweight benchmarking library for
JavaScript. 

 MAYBE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Maybe is an open-source personal finance app that used to be a
(failed) startup. It features net worth tracking, financial account
syncing, investment benchmarking, and more. The app is built with
Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node, Express, and Postgres. 

 EXPLORING THE REDUX SECOND GENERATION (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Redux Toolkit has become the standard method for creating Redux apps,
reducing boilerplate code and streamlining state management. The key
changes in Redux Toolkit 2.0 include modernization, better workflow,
dependency updates, and the introduction of new features like lazy
loading slices and dynamic middleware.

 PASSING NOTHING IS SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 It‚Äôs difficult to represent empty slices of memory in languages
like C, C++, and Rust. The differences in rules and behaviors in these
languages can cause compatibility issues when working with Foreign
Function Interfaces (FFIs). To make empty slices less complicated,
Rust needs to improve its slice representation and have FFI helpers
introduced into its standard library. 

 HOW OPENAI IS BUILDING ITS MOAT (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI built its initial moat on the cost of training large models
because the general perception in the industry was that large models
meant higher performance. However, the Chinchilla paper (published by
Google DeepMind researchers) proved that bigger models are not
necessarily better. Now, OpenAI is defending its moat by creating
network effects around ChatGPT with the release of the GPT Store,
ChatGPT Plugins, and the ChatGPT Team plan for enterprises.

 U.S. DEVELOPERS CAN NOW OFFER NON-APP STORE PURCHASING OPTION, BUT
APPLE WILL STILL COLLECT COMMISSIONS (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Apple made a major change to its US iOS App Store policies that now
allows developers to direct customers to non-App Store purchasing
options for digital products. However, Apple still intends to collect
a hefty 12-27% commission on revenue that‚Äôs brought in this way.

(7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Chrome for Developers provides a guide for automating browser testing
for Web AI applications and other applications that utilize WebGPU and
WebGL. 

 THE "MOM TEST" IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: ASKING GOOD QUESTIONS WHEN
EVERYONE IS LYING TO YOU (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 It‚Äôs important to dig deeper when asking questions to uncover
users' true needs when building tools for developers. The litmus test
for dev tools usually is if it exists in a big company but doesn‚Äôt
externally.
