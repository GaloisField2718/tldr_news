ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HANDLING COOKIES IS A MINEFIELD (18 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 HTTP cookies are inconsistently handled across browsers and
programming languages due to ambiguities in the RFC specifications.
These inconsistencies are from mismatches between what servers should
send and what browsers must accept, leading to situations where
cookies containing perfectly valid characters for browsers are
rejected by server-side code. This problem results in unpredictable
behavior, with some systems silently dropping cookies and others
percent-encoding values or failing completely. 

 THE FALLACIES OF DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Some fallacies about distributed systems include assumptions about
network reliability, zero latency, infinite bandwidth, and network
security. Good distributed systems are designed to handle network
unreliability and mitigate latency and bandwidth constraints. 

 PROCESS SLOW NETWORK REQUESTS WITH TURBO AND ACTIVE MODEL (9 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 User experience in Rail applications can be improved by processing
slow network requests asynchronously using Turbo and Active Model.
This involves moving the slow operation to a background job,
displaying a loading screen, and then updating the client with the
response using Turbo Streams.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AI IS TAKING YOUR JOB (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The use of AI in job applications is increasing. Applicants use AI to
generate resumes and hiring managers use AI to filter them. This
creates more competition, making genuine human connections more
valuable than ever. 

 FILE OVER APP: A PHILOSOPHY FOR DIGITAL LONGEVITY (7 MINUTE READ) [9]


 "File over app" means storing information in easily accessible
formats like plain text and Markdown. This approach prevents data loss
due to app discontinuation or lack of export functionality. 

 STAFF ENGINEER BEHAVIORS: BREAKING THE CEILING INTO STAFF ENGINEERING
PT. 2 (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Advancing to Staff-Plus engineering roles requires engaging in
behaviors like strategic decision-making, mentorship, and
cross-functional collaboration with a focus on aligning technical work
to business goals. Scaling impact involves not just solving problems
but enabling others to succeed and influencing beyond immediate teams.

MINUTE READ) [16]

single-packet attack, for discovering hidden vulnerabilities and
misconfigurations in web applications. 

 SELL CHROME TO END SEARCH MONOPOLY, GOOGLE TOLD (4 MINUTE READ) [17]

 HYRUM'S LAW IN GOLANG (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Hyrum's Law, which states that all observable behaviors of a widely
used API will eventually be depended upon by someone, explains why
seemingly insignificant aspects of code, like error messages, cannot
be changed without potentially breaking dependent systems. 

 MATHEMATICAL THINKING ISN'T WHAT YOU THINK IT IS (10 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Mathematical thinking is a process of iterative refinement between

increased clarity of thought, self-confidence, and creativity. 

 UNCONTROLLED OR CONTROLLED: A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE (4 MINUTE READ)
[20]
