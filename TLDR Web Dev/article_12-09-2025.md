ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BEHIND THE SCENES OF BUN INSTALL (37 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bun is a JavaScript runtime that achieves faster package installation
times compared to npm, pnpm, and yarn by treating it as a systems
programming problem rather than a JavaScript one. This speed comes by
minimizing system calls by using Zig, caching manifests in binary
format, optimizing tarball extraction, using OS-native file copying
mechanisms, and scaling across multiple CPU cores. Unlike
Node.js-based package managers that suffer from JavaScript overhead
and thread pool limitations, Bun directly invokes system calls,
resulting in faster file processing. 

 HASHED SORTING IS TYPICALLY FASTER THAN HASH TABLES (16 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Hashed sorting can outperform hash tables for counting unique values
in large arrays despite hash tables having better theoretical
complexity. This is because hashed sorting uses memory bandwidth more
efficiently, especially when data outgrows CPU caches. While hash
tables are preferable when accesses outnumber unique keys, hashed
radix sorts shine when accesses and unique keys are in the same order
due to their smaller memory footprint.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THINGS I WISH I KNEW BEFORE SWITCHING TO REACT NATIVE (8 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Core React concepts like hooks, functional components, and state
management carry over when transitioning from React to React Native.
However, developers must adapt to using native components instead of
HTML elements, JavaScript objects for styling instead of CSS, and
React Navigation instead of React Router. The good news is that API
handling with libraries like Axios and TanStack Query remains largely
the same, and responsive design principles using Flexbox still apply. 

 MANY HARD LEETCODE PROBLEMS ARE EASY CONSTRAINT PROBLEMS (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Many challenging Leetcode problems can be easily solved using
constraint solvers, a more effective approach than writing custom
algorithms. This article contains several examples that show how
problems like the coin change, stock trading, and histogram area can
be elegantly expressed and solved using MiniZinc. 

 TOO MANY TOOLS: HOW TO MANAGE FRONTEND TOOL OVERLOAD (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Modern frontend development has become overwhelmed with too many tool
choices. The early period back in the early 2010s felt simpler due to
constrained tool defaults, modest developer expectations, and stable
web standards, whereas post-2015 saw an explosion of tools driven by
rapid ECMAScript releases, evolving web standards, and the rise of
single-page applications (SPAs) and TypeScript.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 USING THE DEEPL API TO SCALE MULTILINGUAL WEBSITES (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Launching or scaling a multilingual website? Learn how to do so
effortlessly with the DeepL language API and Weglot. This webinar [9]
will cover best practices for creating customized multilingual
websites, what you need from a language API, and how to stay secure
and compliant. Join live on September 25 [9] 

 RESHAPED (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Reshaped is a library of beautiful React and Figma components for
building products or design systems. 

 REACT NATIVE ENRICHED (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 React Native Enriched is a React Native library that provides a fully
native and customizable rich text editor component for both Android
and iOS. It has synchronous text styling, live styling detection, and
HTML parsing, and supports features like mentions, links, and inline
images (with some platform limitations). 

 JETZIG WEB FRAMEWORK (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Jetzig is an open-source web framework written in Zig. It has
features like file-based routing, Zmpl templating for HTML, default
JSON rendering for RESTful APIs, and a powerful database layer via
JetQuery. Jetzig uses http.zig for performance and has user-friendly
tooling, middleware support, and built-in session management.

 CLAUDE MEMORY: A DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The memory systems of Claude and ChatGPT are built differently.
Claude's memory operates on a blank slate, activating only when
explicitly invoked and retrieving information directly from raw
conversation history through tools like "conversation_search" and
"recent_chats". On the other hand, ChatGPT has an always-on,
personalized memory system that builds detailed user profiles for
instant recall. 

 DISPOSABLE CODE IS HERE TO STAY, BUT DURABLE CODE IS WHAT RUNS THE
WORLD (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Disposable code is useful for short-term tasks, while durable code is
necessary for critical systems. While disposable code (usually
AI-generated) is cheap and useful for experimentation, durable code
requires careful maintenance, testing, and observability due to its
high-stakes nature. 

 NPM AUTHOR QIX COMPROMISED VIA PHISHING EMAIL IN MAJOR SUPPLY CHAIN
ATTACK (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A phishing attack compromised the npm account of the npm package
maintainer Qix, leading to malicious versions of widely-used
JavaScript packages like chalk, debug, and strip-ansi that
collectively receive billions of downloads weekly being published. The
attackers injected cryptocurrency-stealing malware that redirects
crypto transactions to their own addresses across 19 compromised
packages.

 RAILS ON SQLITE: EXCITING NEW WAYS TO CAUSE OUTAGES (15 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Using SQLite in Rails applications, particularly with Rails 8's new
features, is simpler and more cost-effective for smaller projects, but
also has pitfalls like data loss, concurrency issues, and deployment
challenges. 

 REPO STATE LOOPHOLES DURING AGENTIC EVALUATION (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 SWE-bench (the popular AI benchmark for SWE tasks) has identified
that AI agents can exploit loopholes by accessing future repository
states (including solutions) through `git` commands, leading to
inaccurate benchmark results. 

 THE RISE OF ASYNC PROGRAMMING (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Async programming is a new workflow where developers focus on clearly
defining problems and verifying results, delegating the implementation
to AI agents or teammates for background processing. 

 HOW I SOLVED PYTORCH'S CROSS-PLATFORM NIGHTMARE (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This dev overcame the challenge of creating a single-command PyTorch
installation for their FileChat package across different operating
systems and hardware by using PEP 508's ability to specify wheel URLs
with Python version constraints.
