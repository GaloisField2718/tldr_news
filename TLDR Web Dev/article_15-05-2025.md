ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BINARY FORMATS ARE BETTER THAN JSON IN BROWSERS! (11 MINUTE READ) [8]


 JSON is now often outperformed by binary formats like Avro, Protobuf,
and Bebop for data-intensive web apps. New libraries today allow for
faster deserialization of binary data. Bebop, Avro, and Protobuf have
advantages in speed and type safety, overcoming JSON's limitations,
such as string input requirements and lack of schema validation. 

 MIGRATING TO POSTGRES (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Motion previously used CockroachDB for its scalability, but recently
migrated to Postgres due to escalating costs and performance issues.
Its single-region setup didn't fully use CockroachDB's distributed
capabilities. The migration addressed problems with Prisma migrations
timing out, slow ETL processes, and inconsistent query speeds, where
CockroachDB's query planner often resulted in slower performance than
Postgres. A custom ETL solution was built using Bun to migrate the
data. 

 THE SERVER THAT WASN'T MEANT TO EXIST (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A consultant installed a NetBSD server to improve data management for
a family business after the owner's death, but encountered resistance
from a right-hand man potentially involved in embezzlement. This man
attempted to sabotage the server, but the consultant had secretly
backed up the data to an external device.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 LLMS ARE MAKING ME DUMBER (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Using LLMs for coding, math, email writing, and problem-solving is
potentially making this dev less capable. There's a trade-off between
increased output speed and a decrease in depth of understanding. Devs
need to actively preserve core abilities like critical thinking and
long-term focus. 

 THE PERVERSE INCENTIVES OF VIBE CODING (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This dev's addiction to using AI coding assistants like Claude Code
is driven by the unpredictable rewards of "vibe coding." These AI
systems often generate verbose, over-engineered code, which
paradoxically costs users more due to token-based pricing models. This
creates a perverse incentive where AI companies benefit from
inefficient code, and optimizing for conciseness could negatively
impact their revenue.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GIT-BUG (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Git-bug is a decentralized issue tracker that stores issues as Git
objects, allowing for offline work and synchronization across remotes.
It has native Git storage, versioning, speed, third-party bridges, and
multiple interfaces (CLI, TUI, and web). 

 RIGHTNOW AI (WEBSITE) [14] 

 RightNow AI is an AI-powered platform that helps CUDA engineers
automatically profile, optimize, and generate high-performance CUDA
kernels, improving performance by up to 20x. 

 PPTXGENJS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 PptxGenJS is a JavaScript library for creating professional
PowerPoint presentations programmatically in environments like Node,
React, and web browsers. It has features like slide customization,
chart creation, and HTML-to-PowerPoint conversion.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW THE ECONOMICS OF MULTITENANCY WORK (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Blacksmith, a serverless CI platform, uses the economics of
multitenancy to achieve profitability. CI workloads are spiky and
chaotic, making a serverless model efficient, as customers borrow
resources only when needed. Blacksmith smooths out individual spikes
in demand by pooling resources across multiple customers, increasing
overall fleet utilization, which leads to better gross margins. 

 CODING ASSISTANTS THREATEN THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN (5 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Agentic coding assistants like GitHub Copilot introduce new security
vulnerabilities to the software supply chain due to their ability to
interact with developer environments and execute commands. Specific
risks include context poisoning, privilege escalation, and new weak
points in MCP servers and rules files. 

 WHAT IS HDR, ANYWAY? (13 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 HDR (High Dynamic Range) in photography is a feature designed to
capture and display a wider range of light and dark than standard
cameras and screens. There are two common understandings of HDR: the
"HDR mode" in phone cameras, which uses computational photography to
create an SDR image, and HDR displays, which can show more vibrant
images.

confusion and expand its focus beyond developer Q&A.
