ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY YOU WANT REACT QUERY (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 React Query is a library for managing asynchronous states in React
applications. While simple data fetching can be done without React
Query, there are five potential issues when fetching data using the
traditional approach with useEffect and useState. These include race
conditions, lack of loading and empty states, data and error state not
resetting when the category changes, and the useEffect firing twice in
StrictMode. This article shows how React Query is able to fix these
issues by simplifying data fetching, improving code quality, and
handling these issues more efficiently - with code examples. 

 THE ULTIMATE INTERACTIVE JQ GUIDE (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 JQ is a powerful tool for processing JSON data efficiently. This
article demonstrates how JQ is used with various practical examples,
such as working with JSON responses from APIs, converting data to or
from JSON format, managing JSON configuration files, parsing JSON data
from websites, analyzing server logs, and monitoring data. It also
provides basic examples of JQ operations, including selecting values,
filtering arrays, mapping arrays, combining filters, splitting
strings, using conditional logic, and handling null values. 

 AN INTUITIVE INTRODUCTION TO TEXT EMBEDDINGS (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Text embeddings are representations of text in high-dimensional
spaces for various NLP tasks like search, spam filtering, content
moderation, and conversational agents. The preservation of distance is
a key feature of embedding spaces. This article goes through the
evolution of sequential models in NLP, including fully-recurrent
neural networks, long short-term memory, and the transformer
architecture, which uses attention mechanisms to better capture the
context and dependencies between words in a sequence and has become
essential in large language models.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 10 HARD-TO-SWALLOW TRUTHS THEY WON'T TELL YOU ABOUT SOFTWARE ENGINEER
JOB (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article talks about the harsh realities of working as a software
engineer and provides valuable insights for newcomers to the field. It
emphasizes that college education may not adequately prepare students
for the practical challenges of the job and encourages them to gain
real-world experience and develop a portfolio. The article also
underscores the importance of soft skills, as they can often be more
valuable than technical skills for career growth and success in the
industry. 

 MICROSERVICES AREN'T THE PROBLEM. INCOMPETENT PEOPLE ARE (16 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Microservices themselves are not inherently problematic, but there
are issues that stem from a lack of engineering competence and care
within companies. It is important to hire competent individuals,
provide proper education and mentorship, and maintain a focus on
simplicity and code quality. Take ownership of services and don‚Äôt
let external teams interfere too much.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REGISTRATION FORM BEST PRACTICES BY FUSIONAUTH (SPONSOR) [13] 

 Signing up for accounts is something we‚Äôre all familiar with, and
none of us enjoy. As an app developer, you can and should make your
registration process simpler.
This guide by FusionAuth [13] covers:

	* Alternatives to registration forms
	* Practical ways to improve the experience when you absolutely need
the user to fill in some data. These include using multi-step
registration, maintaining state, and more.

 SSHX (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Sshx is a web-based collaborative terminal. Users can easily share
their terminal by running a single command, manipulate terminal
windows on an infinite canvas, observe real-time cursor movements of
collaborators, and connect to a distributed mesh of servers for
optimal performance. The terminal is end-to-end encrypted, with
real-time latency estimates and predictive echo for faster local
editing. 

 LOSSLESS-JSON (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Lossless-json allows developers to parse JSON without risk of losing
numeric information. It works similarly to the native JSON parse and
stringify functions except it preserves information of big numbers.

MISCELLANEOUS

 APPLE'S TRADEMARK EXPLOIT (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Apple protects its trademark by placing its logo on every internal
component of its devices, even if those components are not visible to
consumers. This practice allows Apple to enlist the help of Customs
and Border Patrol (CBP) in enforcing trademark protection at ports of
trade. Apple participates in CBP's e-Recordation Program, which grants
it special enforcement privileges and even allows the company to train
law enforcement personnel. This system has been criticized for
enabling Apple to abuse trademark law to stifle competition and hinder
third-party repairs, with CBP seizing legitimate products from
competitors and independent repair shops on Apple's behalf. 

 STOP USING LAMBDA LAYERS (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Lambda layers are a popular solution for managing dependencies in AWS
Lambda functions. Layers themselves are nothing more than a zip file,
but they have a few interesting properties that prove useful in some
cases. Unfortunately, Lambda layers are also difficult to work with as
a developer, tricky to deploy safely, and typically don't offer
benefits over native package managers. These downsides frequently
outweigh the upsides. This article examines Lambda layers and native
package managers in detail.

 HOW TO AVOID PROP DRILLING IN REACT (11 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Prop drilling is when you pass props to children components that do
not consume the prop, but also only pass down the prop to children
components. This article explains prop drilling in detail and ways to
avoid prop drilling through component composition and moving states. 

 BUILD A LIGHTWEIGHT CODE GENERATOR WITH TYPESCRIPT AND JSON IMPORTS
(4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A quick tutorial on building a code generator, which is useful when
your software interfaces with external systems and depends on
information structures provided by that system.

Generation (RAG) application using Node.js and LangChain.
Specifically, it shows how you build a tool for asking technical
questions about the content of YouTube videos.
