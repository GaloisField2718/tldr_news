ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 OPTIMIZING JAVASCRIPT FOR FUN AND FOR PROFIT (24 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This is a summary of common JavaScript optimization techniques and
ways to benchmark performance. Some common practices that can actually
hurt performance include string comparison, operating on objects of
different shapes, and array/object methods like map, reduce, and
filter. 

 DESIGNING A PURE PYTHON WEB FRAMEWORK (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Reflex is a Python-based web framework where apps are built using
composable Python functions as components. Under the hood, it compiles
frontend code into a React app and backend logic into a FastAPI
server. State and logic are defined in a Python State class, bridging
event handling and communication between the frontend and backend.
Reflex uses WebSockets to send events from the frontend to the backend
and update state accordingly. 

 HOW WE BUILT A CUSTOM PERMISSIONS DSL AT FIGMA (22 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Figma had a complex permissions setup, the implementation of which
was causing tech debt, bugs, and delays. After not finding any open
source answers, its team built a cross-platform DSL (domain specific
language) that isolated policies and data while improving performance,
accuracy, and developer ergonomics. This is a good case study on
problem discovery and building an MVP all the way to a performant and
long-lasting solution.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE THE JUMP FROM "SENIOR" TO "STAFF" DEV, HOW IS IT
WORKING OUT? (REDDIT THREAD) [7] 

 Staff engineers generally code less than senior engineers and instead
need to show impact on an organizational level. This means that the
scope of work is often vague and staff engineers have to spend more of
their time building cross-functional relationships and getting people
excited about their ideas. While they occasionally code, most of their
technical work is at a higher level, like architecture and design. 

 PROGRAMMERS ARE BAD AT MANAGING STATE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The age-old tech support advice, "turn it off and on again," is
surprisingly effective because it resets programs to a known good
state. Software complexity makes it impossible to anticipate every
possible state or interaction a user might encounter. Solutions like
dedicated uninstaller programs and browser "refresh" features offer
users an easy way to reset state. Most software programs for users
should provide a way to reset state as a way to deal with unforeseen
bugs. 

 WHY I LOVE THE WAY C++ SUCKS (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 C++ has a reputation for being confusing, but it can still be
enjoyable due to its powerful type system and other features. C++'s
'=' syntax can have nuanced behavior, allowing for fine-grained,
flexible control over how objects interact. Since C++ is so verbose
and specific, the possibilities for programming in C++ are endless.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 OPENDEVIN (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 OpenDevin is an open-source project aiming to replicate Devin, the
recently-unveiled AI software engineer capable of executing
engineering tasks. 

 ONEREPO (WEBSITE) [11] 

 oneRepo provides JavaScript and TypeScript monorepo management tools.
It handles common tasks automatically, has strict safety and checks,
and provides human-readable output for logs. 

 MONOLITH (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Monolith is a CLI tool for saving complete web pages as a single HTML
file.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ASK HN: HOW COMMON IS DEVELOPER BURNOUT? HAVE YOU EVER BEEN BURNT
OUT? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [13] 

 Developer burnout occurs for different reasons, depending on the
person. For some people, they don‚Äôt mind working long hours as long
as they are passionate about the work they are doing. Others find that
money or status doesn‚Äôt matter to them as long as they have great
coworkers, a short commute, and work that ends at the same time every
day. 

 HOW I REDUCED (INCREMENTAL) RUST COMPILE TIMES BY UP TO 40% (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Frustrated by slow Rust compile times, this author modified the Rust
compiler (rustc) to cache procedural macro expansions. They focused on
improving incremental build times, which yielded 11-40% faster
incremental builds in real-world projects. 

 WHEN POSTGRES IS NOT ENOUGH: PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF POSTGRESQL VS.
DISTRIBUTED DBMSS (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 PostgreSQL is highly CPU efficient and performs well on a single
server, but sometimes struggles with horizontal scaling and
replication can be a significant bottleneck. Distributed databases can
scale more easily in modest cluster setups, outperforming PostgreSQL
in this aspect.

QUICK LINKS

 MAGICK.CSS (WEBSITE) [16] 

 magick.css is a minimalistic, classless CSS framework that is
contained in a single file and designed to be easy to use and
understand. 

 BUILD TIME IS A COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 While compiler improvements are important, developers share the
responsibility for build times by understanding their build systems,
optimizing code structure, and using language features responsibly. 

 3 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES I WISH I KNEW EARLIER IN MY CAREER
(3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) are useful software development
principles.
