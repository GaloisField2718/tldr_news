 😘 KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. But getting that kind of coverage—and staying there—is
hard and pricey for any size team.

QA Wolf's [4] AI-native service SUPPORTS WEB AND MOBILE APPS,
delivering 80% automated test coverage in weeks [4] and helping teams
SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles to minutes.

With QA Wolf, you get:

✅ Unlimited parallel test runs

✅ 15-min QA cycles

✅ 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation

✅ Zero-flake guarantee

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [5] saw 4x more test cases
and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

 HOW CURSOR INDEXES CODEBASES FAST (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cursor, an AI IDE, uses Merkle trees to efficiently index codebases.
The process involves chunking code into semantic pieces, creating a
Merkle tree of hashes, and synchronizing it with Cursor's server to
generate and store embeddings in a vector database. Merkle trees allow
Cursor to quickly identify and update only the changed files, reducing
bandwidth and processing time. 

 HYPER-TYPING (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hyper-typing in TypeScript is where libraries strive for perfect type
safety but create overly complex and difficult-to-understand types.
This approach can lead to cryptic error messages, unsafe workarounds,
and a frustrating developer experience. Simpler types, even if less
precise, or type generation, often are a better developer experience.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FOUR YEARS OF RUNNING A SAAS IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET (17 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 OnlineOrNot is a self-funded SaaS in a competitive market. Unwavering
principles like dedicating two hours daily and solving customer pain
through iterative development helped the creator, Max Rozen, stay
consistent in growing the company. He prioritized problem-solving over
subscriptions and focused on existing traffic rather than solely
pursuing new users. 

 LEAVING GOOGLE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 After 19 years at Google, Ian Lance Taylor, a Google engineer from
the Go team, is leaving. In this post, Taylor reflects on Go's
unexpected success and his role in its development, including compiler
contributions, build system integration, and the addition of generics.


 IN 2025, VENTURE CAPITAL CAN'T PRETEND EVERYTHING IS FINE ANYMORE (14
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Venture capital is struggling in 2025, with most investments outside
of AI performing poorly due to factors like Trump's tariffs and the
end of zero-interest rates. The industry is heavily reliant on AI,
particularly OpenAI, hoping for lottery-level returns to compensate
for the lack of traditional business success. Many startups are
failing, and cashing out is difficult.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REACT THREE ECOSYSTEM (WEBSITE) [11] 

 React Three provides a collection of tools and libraries for building
3D experiences using React and Three.js. It has components for
rendering, physics, UI, post-processing, XR, state management, and
more. 

 CODESYS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Codesys is a Python SDK for interacting with the Claude CLI tool. It
makes tasks like code exploration, planning, and execution easier with
customizable options for tool access, streaming output, and output
formatting. 

 ABERDEENJS (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Aberdeen is a lightweight (around 5KB) TypeScript/JavaScript library
for building reactive UIs without a virtual DOM. It uses small,
anonymous functions to emit DOM elements and automatically reruns them
when proxied data changes.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CAR COMPANIES ARE IN A BILLION-DOLLAR SOFTWARE WAR, AND EVERYONE'S
LOSING (13 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Legacy automakers are struggling to develop software-defined vehicles
(SDVs) despite investing billions and poaching talent. Tesla pioneered
the SDV with over-the-air updates and centralized computing, but
legacy companies are finding it difficult to shift from their
traditional hardware-focused approach. These companies face challenges
in merging safety-first mindsets with the speed and creativity needed
for software development, plus they need to support both EVs and
internal combustion engines. 

 WHY THE APPLE II DIDN'T SUPPORT LOWERCASE LETTERS (5 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Steve Wozniak, being financially constrained, initially used an
affordable $60 uppercase-only keyboard for his TV Terminal project in
the early 1970s. This terminal became the input/output for his early
computer designs, including the Apple I. While Wozniak later wanted to
add lowercase support, the handwritten and hand-assembled code of the
Apple I and Apple II, coupled with continued financial limitations,
made implementing such a significant change too difficult. 

 WHY BELL LABS WORKED (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Bell Labs thrived due to a management style that prioritized radical
freedom and autonomy for talented researchers, which let them pursue
their interests without pressure for immediate results. Mervin Kelly,
the lab's builder, focused on identifying individuals with innate
drive and a thirst for knowledge, providing them with problems to
solve and trusting their abilities. The lab's success was from a
formula of finding great people, fostering collaboration, providing
curated problems, and allowing years for exploration.
