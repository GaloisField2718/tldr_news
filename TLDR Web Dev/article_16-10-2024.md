 👋 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you must check out QA
Wolf.

QA Wolf [4] gets engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test
coverage [4] and helps them ship 5x faster by reducing QA cycles from
hours to minutes.

They create and maintain your test suite in open-source Playwright.
Plus, they provide unlimited parallel test runs on their
infrastructure (zero flakes guarantee [4]).

✔️ No more manual e2e testing

✔️ No more QA bottlenecks

✔️ No more bugs reaching your customers

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [5] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY YOU SHOULDN'T FORGET TO OPTIMIZE THE DATA LAYOUT (12 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The way data is organized in memory (data layout) can impact a
program's performance. Choosing the right data layout, such as Array
of Structures (AoS) or Structure of Arrays (SoA), can optimize cache
line access and leverage vectorized instructions (SIMD) for faster
execution. SoA, for example, can be much faster for reading
operations, especially when combined with lightweight compression
techniques like frame-of-reference encoding. 

 LOCALSTORAGE VS. INDEXEDDB VS. COOKIES VS. OPFS VS. WASM-SQLITE (20
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article compares different methods for storing data in web
browsers: Cookies, LocalStorage, IndexedDB, OPFS, and WASM-SQLite.
Each method is analyzed for their features, limitations, and
performance in various scenarios, including write and read latency for
single and bulk operations. 

 PYTHON: RANGE IS NOT AN ITERATOR (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Iterators and range objects are different in Python. While both are
considered "lazy iterables" as they compute values on demand, they
differ in their underlying mechanisms. Iterators are stateful, meaning
once an item is consumed, it's gone. Range objects are not iterators -
they are "lazy sequences" that can be looped over repeatedly without
exhausting their values. 

🧠 

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SMURF: BEYOND THE TEST PYRAMID (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SMURF (Speed, Maintainability, Utilization, Reliability, and
Fidelity) is a framework for better testing. Prioritizing one factor
can have implications for others, so it's best to have a holistic
approach when writing tests for applications. 

 SCALE RUINS EVERYTHING (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The pursuit of unicorn status by venture capital funds has led to the
creation of companies that, while initially seemingly harmless, become
detrimental at scale. This is because the need for massive growth
drives companies to exploit resources and disrupt markets. The recent
decline in venture capital funding offers an opportunity for more
non-hyper growth companies that are still sustainable businesses. 

 A MISSING IDE FEATURE (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This developer proposes a missing IDE feature: automatically folding
method bodies by default. This simple change improves code
readability, as function signatures are often more important than
their bodies. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REACT NATIVE BOTTOMSHEET V5 IS FINALLY OUT! (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 React Native Bottom Sheet v5 has been released. It features a
complete gesture solution rewrite, support for React Native Web,
dynamic sizing, FlashList integration, and performance improvements. 

 KAIBANJS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 KaibanJS is a JavaScript framework for building and managing
multi-agent systems. 

 FTWA (WEBSITE) [14] 

 FTWA allows users to turn any website into a lightweight, fast, and
visually appealing app. It removes the need for browser frames and
creates a native app-like experience.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY TECHIES LEAVE BIG TECH (31 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Software engineers and tech leaders are leaving prestigious Big Tech
companies. There are various reasons why, like the decline in job
security due to recent layoffs, the allure of professional growth and
leadership opportunities offered by startups, and the perceived
limitations of career progression within large corporations. There's
also the impact of equity compensation and the potential for
significant pay drops when stock prices fall or initial grants expire.


 META'S OPEN AI HARDWARE VISION (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Meta has presented its open AI hardware vision, showcasing new
designs for AI platforms, racks, network fabrics, and components. To
support its large-scale AI workloads, Meta has built high-performance
training clusters with thousands of GPUs. To address the increasing
power and bandwidth demands of AI, Meta has Catalina, a new
high-powered rack designed for AI workloads, and Grand Teton, a
next-generation AI platform now supporting AMD accelerators.

QUICK LINKS

 DARK PATTERNS HALL OF SHAME (WEBSITE) [17] 

 The Hall of Shame critiques poor design practices and dark patterns,
specifically in websites, apps, and user experiences. 

 SQLITE3 WEBASSEMBLY & JAVASCRIPT DOCUMENTATION (WEBSITE) [18] 

 SQLite has published documentation on running SQLite locally
in-browser using WebAssembly. 

 AN OVERLOADED DEVELOPER (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A senior developer attempted to implement function overloading in
JavaScript by creating two functions with the same name but different
parameters, but didn't realize JavaScript sets missing parameters to
null when calling a function. 

 SAFER WITH GOOGLE: ADVANCING MEMORY SAFETY (7 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Google is advancing memory safety in its software by shifting towards
memory-safe languages while also hardening existing memory-unsafe
codebases through techniques like bounds-checking, exploit
mitigations, and security boundaries.
