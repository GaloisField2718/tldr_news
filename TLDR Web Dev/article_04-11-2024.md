ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY DOESN'T CLOUDFLARE USE CONTAINERS IN ITS WORKERS PLATFORM
INFRASTRUCTURE? (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Cloudflare's Workers platform uses a V8 isolate architecture instead
of traditional containers due to their ability to achieve
sub-millisecond serverless latency and support a massive number of
tenants without sharing memory or state. Unlike containers, which take
hundreds of milliseconds to seconds to spin up, V8 isolates warm up in
under 5 milliseconds. This lets Cloudflare run thousands of tenant
workloads at the edge with minimal overhead. However, this has its own
limitations, such as the lack of process-level isolation.
