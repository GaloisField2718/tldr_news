 JS DATES ARE ABOUT TO BE FIXED (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Temporal API in JavaScript offers a new approach to handling time
with the Temporal.ZonedDateTime object, which accurately represents
dates and times with their corresponding time zones. This addresses
the limitations of JavaScript's Date object, which doesn't capture the
nuances of human-readable dates and the impact of time zones and
daylight savings time. The new API introduces a standardized format
for representing zoned dates and times, allowing developers to work
with different calendars and time zones easily. 

 POSTGRES AS A SEARCH ENGINE (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 PostgreSQL can be used as a search engine. Combining full-text
search, semantic search with pgvector and fuzzy matching with pg_trgm
makes PostgreSQL a good-enough search engine for a majority of use
cases. This article goes into more advanced techniques to personalized
search experiences, adjust for document length, debug rankings, and
more.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 CORS IS STUPID (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CORS is a flawed attempt to address the security issue of implicit
credentials being used in cross-origin requests. While it does prevent
some forms of data theft, it fails to prevent malicious requests that
can manipulate data, such as transferring money from a user's account.
A more effective approach is to ignore implicit credentials altogether
on cross-origin requests, allowing only explicitly authenticated
requests with a secure authorization header. 

 THE 3 BIG MISTAKES THAT ALMOST COST ME MY PROMOTION (AND HOW YOU CAN
AVOID THEM) (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Software engineers make some common mistakes when trying to get
promoted. They sometimes fall for the ‚ÄúPromotion Donut‚Äù trap,
where focusing solely on next-level responsibilities leads to
neglecting current duties. While it's true ‚Äúwhat got you here won't
get you there,‚Äù you still have to do ‚Äúwhat got you here‚Äù while
also performing at the next level. Additionally, engineers need to
make sure they have a supportive manager and fully understand their
company's leveling system. 

 BIG TECH VS STARTUPS (FOR NEW GRADS) (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 For new graduates, working at a big tech company for the first 1-3
years provides a solid foundation for career growth and skill
development, offering better average outcomes compared to starting at
a startup. However, startups give a chance for more ‚Äúoutlier‚Äù
outcomes compared to Big Tech.

MISCELLANEOUS

 IS TELEGRAM REALLY AN ENCRYPTED MESSAGING APP? (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Telegram, while technically using encryption, doesn't offer
end-to-end encryption by default. Users must manually activate "Secret
Chats" for individual conversations, a feature that is difficult to
find and use, which means that a vast majority of Telegram
conversations are visible to Telegram servers. Furthermore, while
end-to-end encryption is valuable for protecting message content, it
doesn't address the broader issue of metadata collection. 

 CREATE CALENDAR ENTRIES WITH ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 3.5 (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 This developer used Anthropic Claude 3.5 to create calendar entries
from a schedule image. He first asked Claude to identify the dates
outlined in green on the image and then asked it to generate an
iCalendar file (ICS) for those dates. Claude successfully created the
ICS file, which the developer then imported into Google Calendar.

Digits, to meet the growing European demand for data privacy and
control within EU borders.
