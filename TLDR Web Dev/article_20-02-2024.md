ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SERVERLESS ARCHITECTURE DEMYSTIFIED: STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS AND
PITFALLS TO AVOID (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article discusses the evolution and benefits of serverless
computing, which was introduced with AWS Lambda in 2014. It covers
best practices like designing for failure, optimizing performance,
ensuring security, and managing costs. It also highlights common
pitfalls, including cold start latency, security complacency, and
complexity in managing services. 

 SERVING A WEBSITE FROM A GIT REPO WITHOUT CLONING IT (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This article describes a method for serving a website directly from a
git repository using a modified reverse proxy. The traditional method
uses a web server, such as Github Pages, to serve the latest version
of the main branch of a git repository. The new method uses git‚Äôs
internal object structure and a reverse proxy to retrieve content
directly from a remote repository on demand. The pros of this are that
it‚Äôs more efficient than traditional methods and there is no need to
maintain a local copy of the repository, while the drawbacks are that
it is more complex and requires a deeper understanding of git
internals. 

 A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF STATE IN VUE 3.4 (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The defineModel macro introduced in Vue 3.4 simplifies hierarchical
state management and reduces the need for global state or prop
drilling. This article demonstrates how to use defineModel with
composables for further code organization and maintainability.
defineModel makes state management much easier for teams, enabling
them to create clean components that are easy to read and understand.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FROM ENGINEER TO MANAGER: WHAT I LOVE, WHAT I HATE (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 A former front-end developer shares his experience transitioning to
an engineering management role. The pros of the transition include
greater impact, more career opportunities, less knowledge rot, and new
challenges. However, engineering management roles have to deal with
fewer breaks, longer feedback loops, occasional awkward social
situations, and having to deal with corporate politics. 

 UI IS A FUNCTION OF YOUR ORGANIZATION (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A good UI is a function of an organization's ability to deliver on
its promises. The Domino's Pizza Tracker, while convenient for users,
required significant infrastructure and process changes within
Domino's. Compromises are often made between the ideal UI and an
organization's reality. This is why startups, with their flexible
structures, are better suited for innovative UIs. 

 TAILWIND MARKETING AND MISINFORMATION ENGINE (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Tailwind CSS's core idea of utility-first workflow is harmful because
it breaks established best practices and makes code harder to
maintain. Tailwind encourages the use of inline styles and
vendor-specific language expressions, which can make code messy and
difficult to understand. It discourages semantic class names, which
are important for maintainability. Developers should consider learning
proper CSS and follow established best practices such as "content
first" workflow.

 10 UNEXPECTED WAYS TO USE GITHUB COPILOT (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This blog post shows some surprising ways to use Copilot beyond the
basics: run terminal commands from Copilot chat or directly in
terminal using the Copilot CLI, generate pull request summaries,
commit messages and documentation, explain a GitHub repo, bulk close
issues, and get help with error messages. 

 WHY IS GOOGLE KILLING COOKIES? (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google's motives for deprecating third-party cookies are likely
commercial, not privacy-driven, despite the company's emphasis on
protecting user privacy. Apple's App Tracking Transparency privacy
policy is an example of how companies can use privacy rhetoric while
still collecting data. Google's main motivation for deprecating
third-party cookies is to boost its own margins by shifting ad spend
from its lower-margin Network business to its higher-margin
owned-and-operated channels.
