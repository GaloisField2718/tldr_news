 PRINTING PERFECTION, A DEVELOPER‚ÄôS JOURNEY WITH REACT-TO-PRINT (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post details the process of implementing a custom way to print
pages in a commercial application using the "react-to-print" library.
The post discusses the limitations of the browser's default print API
and why react-to-print was chosen. The journey includes a proof of
concept phase, addressing challenges in documentation and
implementation, handling specific requirements like hiding elements on
print, and debugging issues related to state management and browser
interactions. 

 RETHINKING SERVERLESS WITH FLAME (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While serverless architecture makes scaling easier, it also
introduces complexities that can overcomplicate things and make it
harder to develop, test, and deploy software. The FLAME pattern,
Fleeting Lambda Application for Modular Execution, aims to fix these
problems by treating entire applications like a lambda, executing
modular parts in short-lived architecture. This article breaks down
exactly how the FLAME pattern works and shows what it looks like in
practice paired with an Elixir backend.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 CARE BEYOND CODE: 7 BEST DESIGN PRACTICES FOR FRONTEND DEVELOPERS (13
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When a frontend engineer fails to think about the importance of
design, the user experience can suffer. This post highlights the
importance of a holistic approach, offering pointers and best
practices to ultimately result in less bugs and overall delays. Being
a better designer as a frontend engineer allows one to bring more
value to a project beyond just writing code. 

 HOW TO BUILD A PERSONAL BRAND AS A DEVELOPER (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Having a strong personal brand as a developer can bring many
benefits. You can establish credibility, stand out amongst other
software engineers during interviews, and build a strong network among
other things. This article explains how you can begin building your
own brand, both on and offline.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 üëâ¬†80% AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE IN 4 MONTHS OR LESS?
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Better test coverage = better software. QA Wolf [11] is the fast lane
to automated testing. Get a tailored test suite written in open-source
Playwright (no more false positives or flaky tests) with unlimited
parallel test runs on hosted infrastructure. And it takes weeks, not
years.
üí∞¬†QA Wolf saves customers up to $200k+/year [11] in engineering
and infrastructure costs, according to public case studies.

 MLX (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 MLX is an Apple machine learning framework designed for Apple
silicon, featuring both Python and C++ APIs. It is compatible with
existing tools like NumPy and PyTorch. MLX offers composable function
transformations for automatic differentiation and graph optimization,
while computations are executed lazily, reducing unnecessary
processing. 

 WING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Winglang is a newly introduced open-source programming language
tailored for cloud-based development. It empowers developers to create
distributed systems that integrate cloud services into the programming
model. Wing programs can be run locally with a simulator or deployed
to any cloud provider. 

 STYLEX (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 StyleX is an expressive, deterministic, reliable, and scalable
styling system. It was carefully designed to meet the requirements of
large application, reusable component libraries, and statically typed
codebases. StyleX is fully typed and supports an expressive subset of
CSS. It takes the developer experience of CSS-in-JS libraries and uses
compile-time tooling to bridge it with the performance and scalability
of static CSS.

 HOW GENERATIVE AI WILL CREATE A DEVELOPER TALENT SHORTAGE (4 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 With AI becoming increasingly powerful, many fear that it will begin
to replace junior engineers. This article points out how replacing
junior engineers with AI means that in the long run, we might not have
engineers with enough skills to solve the more complex problems AI
can‚Äôt fix. To prepare for this possible outcome, the article
encourages all software developers to spend time upskilling and
gaining new technical knowledge to keep up with the changing
landscape.
