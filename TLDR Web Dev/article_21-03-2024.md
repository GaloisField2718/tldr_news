ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW GOOGLE TAKES THE PAIN OUT OF CODE REVIEWS, WITH 97% DEV
SATISFACTION (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google's code review tool, Critique, is highly rated among software
engineers internally. This article looks at what makes Critique so
loved and explains how it pairs with Google's code review process. It
covers Google's guidelines for efficient code review, internal
statistics on Google code reviews, and how Google uses AI to speed up
code reviews for engineers. 

 PRETENDING TO BE POSTGRESQL: PART ONE (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This walkthrough teaches readers how to build a simple PostgreSQL
server impersonator in Python. It‚Äôs a useful exercise in
understanding the PostgreSQL protocol and studying attack patterns.
The server mimics the initial PostgreSQL handshake sequence, including
authentication, and successfully fools the psql client into thinking
it's a PostgreSQL server. 

 OPTIMIZING RTC BANDWIDTH ESTIMATION WITH MACHINE LEARNING (8 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Meta's video calling products rely on bandwidth estimation (BWE) and
congestion control for optimal performance. Its hand-tuned system was
complex and difficult to maintain, so its team developed an ML
approach for network characterization and optimization, replacing
hand-tuned rules to improve efficiency and reliability. The ML system
analyzes network signals to classify network types and applies
optimized settings for BWE and network resiliency.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FOCUS BY AUTOMATION (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Distractions while programming can easily derail focus and
productivity. To combat distractions, developers should invest in
personal organization (using tools like GTD or Zettelkasten) and
master tools like editors, programming, and languages. Developers can
free up brainpower for deeper problem-solving and more focus by
automating common tasks and internalizing the mechanics of their
tools. 

 DEATH TO THE INVINCIBLE ENGINEER (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The "me against the world" mentality that some engineers have is
destructive. Openness about weaknesses creates trust and unity within
a team. Leaders should embrace vulnerability and encourage
authenticity, open communication, and learning within the company
culture. Toxic team members should be addressed directly. 

 OUR SUBTLE HABIT OF MISUSING MANAGERIAL AUTHORITY (18 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Many leadership mistakes stem from managers subtly misusing their
authority over employees. Even with good intentions, this undermines
employees‚Äô productivity and performance. To change this, managers
must become more aware of the unintended impacts of their power, stop
relying on authority as a crutch, and build relationships based on
trust.

MISCELLANEOUS

 8 GOOGLE EMPLOYEES INVENTED MODERN AI. HERE‚ÄôS THE INSIDE STORY (20
MINUTE READ) [25] 

 Eight Google researchers made a breakthrough in 2017 with a paper
titled "Attention Is All You Need," which introduced the Transformer
architecture now powering AI systems like ChatGPT. The paper
demonstrated the power of attention mechanisms and outperformed
existing methods. The eight authors have since left Google to found
successful AI startups. Their groundbreaking research has had a
widespread impact. 

 THE TECH TALENT ACQUISITION LANDSCAPE (11 MINUTE READ) [26] 

 There are various ways to acquire tech talent today, including
utilizing agencies, Talent as a Service, contractors, and hiring
direct in-house talent. Companies should use a mix of these methods.
Developers should optimize for learning and seek out challenging work.
Larger projects offer leadership opportunities, while smaller projects
build a broader skillset. If they find a place where they‚Äôre
growing, they should stay there. 

 UNDER THE HOOD: HOW OPENAI'S SORA MODEL WORKS (16 MINUTE READ) [27] 

 OpenAI's Sora model for AI-generated video builds on diffusion models
instead of operating on raw pixels. It works in a compressed 'latent
space' and uses the Transformer architecture. Like with large language
models, throwing more compute at Sora yields better results. Sora is
good enough for real-world use, but it is expensive as the inference
cost could require hundreds of thousands of GPUs at its peak.

 GITHUB‚ÄôS LATEST AI TOOL CAN AUTOMATICALLY FIX CODE VULNERABILITIES
(2 MINUTE READ) [28] 

 GitHub's new AI tool combines Copilot and CodeQL to automatically
find and fix security vulnerabilities in code, freeing up developers'
time. 

 10 REASONS WHY STATIC SITE GENERATORS ARE PERFECT FOR MODERN WEB
DEVELOPMENT (2 MINUTE READ) [29] 

 Static site generators offer simplicity, flexibility, performance,
versatility, and developer-friendliness. 

 REGEX CHARACTER ‚Äú$‚Äù DOESN'T MEAN ‚ÄúEND-OF-STRING‚Äù (1 MINUTE
READ) [30] 

 The regex character '$' doesn't always mean "end-of-string" in Python
- it also matches the position before a trailing newline, making
reliable end-of-string matching language-dependent.
