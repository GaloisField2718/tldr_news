ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 ESCAPING THE CHROME SANDBOX THROUGH DEVTOOLS (25 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Vulnerabilities in Chromium allowed malicious Chrome extensions to
execute arbitrary shell commands. By exploiting undocumented features
in the chrome://policy page and a race condition in the
chrome.devtools API, users were able to bypass the sandbox and execute
code outside the browser's restrictions. 

 WHY DOES EVERYONE RUN ANCIENT POSTGRES VERSIONS? (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 While Postgres 17 offers huge improvements, most users stick with
older versions due to the perceived stability of the database and the
challenges of upgrading. Major version upgrades can be complex and
require extensive planning, data migration, and testing, especially
for large production databases. However, delaying upgrades inevitably
leads to technical debt. There is now a tool available called PG
Versions that can help visualize the new benefits of upgrading earlier
rather than later. 

 EVAL-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT: BUILD BETTER AI FASTER (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Evals, a new testing paradigm for AI-native development, are similar
to end-to-end tests. They assess the quality of AI output using
automated checks, human judgment, and AI-assisted grading. Vercel's
frontend-generating AI product v0 is built on eval-driven development.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 EVALUATION QUIRKS, METRIC PITFALLS, AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There are a few issues with system evaluation practices, like in
cases where metrics with similar names yield vastly different results,
implementation bugs lead to inflated scores, and incorrect predictions
improve the score. Developers need to be careful when choosing metrics
and understand what a metric truly measures to make sure it's
implemented correctly. 

 UNIT TESTS AS DOCUMENTATION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Unit tests can serve as living documentation within the code itself,
explaining how code behaves, staying in sync with code changes, and
covering edge cases. 

 INTERESTING STARTUP IDEA: BENCHMARKING CLOUD PLATFORM PRICING (13
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Spare Cores is a startup that benchmarks cloud platform pricing,
offering a free service that compares prices across providers like
AWS, GCP, Azure, and Hetzner. The company was started with a €150K
grant and a team of three. It uses a combination of Python, Angular,
and various databases to collect and analyze data.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TOLGEE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Tolgee is an open-source localization platform. It provides features
like in-context translation, translation memory, and integration with
machine translation services. 

 SAVA OS (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Sava OS is a desktop interface for web browsers that allows users to
manage, filter, share, and organize their online data in a familiar
environment. It has features like tab management, session control,
personal feed creation, and folder sharing. 

 NOTEBOOKLM UPDATE: AUDIO OVERVIEW CONTROLS AND TEAM COLLABORATIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google's NotebookLM now allows users to customize audio overviews.
There is a pilot program for a business-focused version with enhanced
features.

 NOT REMOTELY COOL: THE SCIENCE OF “ZOOM FATIGUE” (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Zoom fatigue is caused by the cognitive load of online meetings,
which depletes mental resources. Video calls require more effort to
process nonverbal cues and the audio gaps caused by digital
transmission disrupt the natural flow of conversation. The lack of
physical proximity and the blurring of work and home life also make
things mentally tough. 

 USING CLOUDFLARE ON YOUR WEBSITE COULD BE BLOCKING RSS USERS (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Cloudflare's security features, specifically Bot Fight Mode and AI
Scrapers and Crawlers, are unintentionally blocking RSS readers from
accessing websites. This happens because Cloudflare's AI-based system
incorrectly identifies RSS readers as malicious bots, presenting them
with human verification challenges they can't complete. 

 BRAIN DRAIN: DAVID VS GOLIATH (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The demand for data to train large AI models is exceeding the
availability of public data. Researchers are exploring synthetic data
as an alternative, but it can introduce errors and degrade model
performance. A new approach focuses on data quality over quantity,
demonstrating that smaller, highly-trained models can compete with
larger ones.
