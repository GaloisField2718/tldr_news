ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FOUR KINDS OF OPTIMISATION (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article explores four kinds of optimization: using better
algorithms, better data structures, lower-level systems, or accepting
less precise solutions. Each solution involves trade-offs and requires
a deep understanding of the specific context and performance
requirements. Before making assumptions about performance bottlenecks,
it‚Äôs important to rigorously profile an application and use the
right optimizations in the right context. 

 HANDLING FORMS AND VALIDATION IN ANGULAR (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article explains the two ways of working with forms in Angular:
Reactive and Template-driven forms. Reactive forms provide direct
access to the underlying form object model and are suitable for
applications heavily reliant on forms, offering scalability,
reusability, and testability. Template-driven forms use directives
within the template to create and manipulate the form‚Äôs object model
and are simpler to use for basic forms. The article provides a
detailed guide on creating a profile form component to demonstrate how
each type of form is implemented.

 THE ARCHITECTURE OF SERVERLESS DATA SYSTEMS (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The future of cloud data services may focus on serverless,
multi-tenant data architectures. This article examines different
systems like OLTP databases, OLAP, cloud data warehouses, and event
streaming systems. The author notes the growth in serverless
multi-tenant (MT) systems, such as Google's BigQuery and Amazon's
DynamoDB, and explores emerging ones like Neon and CockroachDB. There
are challenges unique to serverless MT systems, such as latency,
consistency, heat management, and the importance of high resource
utilization. 

 UNLOCKING PERFORMANCE ‚Äì A JOURNEY OF SCALING UP WITH ELASTICSEARCH
(8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A team of 3 developers at Monday.com upgraded their Elasticsearch
cluster and improved indexing strategies in just 3 weeks, resulting in
a 3.5x average performance boost and a 40x boost in peak times for
complex queries. This post highlights in detail how the migration
process was performed, breaking it into 5 steps: cluster and index
creations, data integration and performance checks, and throttling and
optimization. It also comes with 6 takeaways that can be helpful for
any general data migration process.
