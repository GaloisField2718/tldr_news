 SAFE AND RELIABLE PRODUCTION CHANGES FOR FAST MOVING TEAMS; AND HOW
RIVIAN RECENTLY GOT THIS WRONG (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Rivian recently made a mistake during an over-the-air software update
for its cars that caused infotainment screens to reboot and become
unusable for several days. It could have prevented this with better
practices like canary deployments, pre-flight checks, and rollback
mechanisms, which are common in cloud systems. Frequent small
deployments and phased rollouts ensure safe changes in production. 

 HOW AMAZON STREAMS LIVE VIDEO TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE (8 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Amazon Prime Video uses a variety of AWS services, including
Elemental MediaConnect, MediaLive, and CloudFront, to ingest, encode,
package, and deliver video content to millions of users. It also
employs redundancy measures and parallelization to ensure that its
system is resilient to failures. By doing so, it is able to achieve an
expected uptime of 99.999%. 

 MEMORY PROFILING PART 1. INTRODUCTION (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Learning about memory profiling can help you understand how an
application uses memory over time and aid in building the right mental
model of a program‚Äôs behavior. This article defines key terms like
memory usage, footprint, VSZ, and RSS and explains how they differ. It
also discusses how this information can be used to identify problems
and understand the pressure on the memory subsystem.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE THREE VIRTUES OF A GREAT PROGRAMMER (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are three virtues of a great programmer: laziness, impatience,
and hubris. Laziness drives efficiency and clear documentation,
impatience fuels proactive and user-friendly solutions, and hubris
motivates crafting well-maintained, respected code. 

 ZERO TO UNMAINTAINABLE IN 1.2 COMMANDS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The web development industry's obsession with speed over
maintainability ultimately leads to unsustainable situations. It‚Äôs
important to consider maintainability throughout the development
process as it‚Äôs much easier to acquire debt than develop on top of
an unmaintainable project.

 OUR NEXT-GENERATION MODEL: GEMINI 1.5 (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google has introduced Gemini 1.5, a large language model with
significantly improved performance and new features, like a one
million token context window. It's still under testing, but it is
available for developers and enterprises in Google‚Äôs AI Studio and
Google Cloud‚Äôs Vertex AI. Gemini 1.5 Pro offers similar performance
to Gemini Ultra but is more efficient and opens up new possibilities
for tasks like better reasoning, code writing, and problem-solving due
to its extensive context.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CODE CHORES: THE BORING PART OF MAINTENANCE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Keeping a self-hosted project healthy requires constant "code chores"
like updating frameworks, fixing bugs, and refactoring code - tasks
less exciting than flashy new features. These chores require
consistent funding and are often overlooked compared to individual
features. Developers should split funds and time between features and
essential maintenance as features need ongoing care to remain
functional and secure. 

 ASK HN: ARE THERE ANY GOOD REASONS TO USE C++ OVER RUST FOR NEW
PROJECTS TODAY? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [16] 

 Rust is quickly growing in popularity, but C++ is still ideal for
many use cases due to its integrations with existing libraries and
familiarity with a large number of developers. C++ has more mature
compilers, libraries, and knowledge overall. Choosing the right
language is best determined by the goal of the project and how
familiar existing teams are already with C++ and Rust. Rust is a great
choice for those who need strong memory safety and want to use a more
modern language. 

 GRADIENT DESCENT INTO MADNESS - BUILDING AN LLM FROM SCRATCH (18
MINUTE READ) [17]
