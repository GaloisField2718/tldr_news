 NEED MEETING RECORDINGS? DON'T BUILD YET-ANOTHER NOTETAKER (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Building meeting bots for every platform your customers use (Meet /
Teams / Zoom) is a massive time sink. Why go to all that trouble, when
the Nylas Notetaker API [4] handles it all with a single integration?

With just a few lines of code, Nylas will record, transcribe, and
analyze meetings [4] in your app, AI agent, or anywhere else.

Nylas:

>¬†connects¬†to¬†users'¬†calendars,¬†automatically¬†joins¬†their¬†meetings,
>¬†and¬†delivers¬†diarized¬†transcripts¬†with¬†speaker¬†identification.

You:

>¬†Get¬†video¬†playback,¬†automatic¬†transcription¬†playback,¬†and¬†analysis
>¬†in¬†your¬†product¬†-¬†fast.

Join the waitlist to try it first. [5]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REACT LABS: VIEW TRANSITIONS, ACTIVITY, AND MORE (27 MINUTE READ) [6]


 React Labs has shared updates on experimental features and ongoing
development, including View Transitions and Activity, both ready for
testing in the React Experimental build. View Transitions simplify UI
animations, while Activity allows hiding and showing UI parts while
preserving state. The team is also working on React Performance
Tracks, Automatic Effect Dependencies via the React Compiler, a
Compiler IDE Extension, Fragment Refs, Gesture Animations, and
Concurrent Stores to improve performance and the developer experience.


 HOW A 20-YEAR-OLD BUG IN GTA SAN ANDREAS SURFACED IN WINDOWS 11 24H2
(14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A 20-year-old bug in GTA San Andreas that causes the Skimmer plane to
disappear in-game has surfaced in Windows 11 24H2. The root cause has
been traced to missing wheel scale parameters in the vehicles.ide file
for the Skimmer, which went unnoticed due to the game's incomplete
data validation. The bug was triggered by changes in Windows 11 24H2's
internal stack management, which overwrote uninitialized values that
the game unintentionally relied upon.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MCPS, GATEKEEPERS, AND THE FUTURE OF AI (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Model Context Protocols (MCPs) are standardized APIs connecting
external data sources and applications to LLMs. The current user
experience and security of MCPs are not good enough yet for widespread
adoption. The power will be with client-side interfaces like ChatGPT
and Claude, who control which MCPs are used and how their responses
are displayed. LLM providers will act as gatekeepers, managing MCP
selection and monetization similar to app stores and search engines. 

 THE HIDDEN COST OF AI CODING (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The increasing use of AI coding tools has worsened the feeling of
"flow" by this developer. The productivity gains of AI are great, but
this developer is worried about getting detached from their craft and
gaining less fulfillment out of coding.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REACT COMPILER RC (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The React team has released React Compiler RC, a near-final version
of their build-time tool that optimizes React apps through automatic
memoization. This release includes improvements like support for
optional chains and array indices as dependencies, easier integration,
and the merging of `eslint-plugin-react-compiler` into
`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`. The compiler is compatible with React 17
and up and supports various build tools like Babel and swc. 

 LEGEND LIST (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Legend List is a high-performance, TypeScript-based React Native list
component designed as a drop-in replacement for FlatList and
FlashList. It has great performance, especially with dynamically sized
items, and supports bidirectional infinite lists and chat UIs without
inverted scrolling. The library is lightweight, 100% JavaScript, and
requires no native module linking. It has features like item recycling
and scroll maintenance at the end for chat interfaces. 

 MOOSE (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Moose is a TypeScript/Python framework that simplifies building
analytical backends by automatically managing data infrastructure like
APIs, streaming, and databases from a single code model.

 DOGE WORKER'S CODE SUPPORTS NLRB WHISTLEBLOWER (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A whistleblower at the NLRB alleges that Elon Musk's DOGE accessed
sensitive NLRB case files and downloaded code libraries, including one
very similar to a program by DOGE employee Marko Elez. The code,
designed for generating pseudo-infinite IPs, could be used for web
scraping and brute force attacks. The DOGE accounts had unrestricted
permissions to read, copy, and alter information. The code found
supports the NLRB whistleblower's claim. 

 DOES USING RUST REALLY MAKE YOUR SOFTWARE SAFER? (16 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Rust can improve software safety by preventing vulnerabilities. The
NAME:WRECK vulnerability in the Nucleus real-time operating system is
a good case study. An experiment was conducted where engineers rewrote
a vulnerable DNS decoding routine in Rust to show how Rust's memory
safety and expressive language reduced the likelihood of introducing
vulnerabilities. Rust implementations avoided arbitrary code execution
vulnerabilities and resulted in recoverable errors, saving time and
money compared to a secure C implementation.

 INDEX (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Index is an open-source browser agent powered by reasoning LLMs with
vision capabilities designed to autonomously execute complex tasks on
the web. 

 PIXEL IS A UNIT OF LENGTH AND AREA (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The overloaded use of "pixel" as both a linear and area unit in
digital imaging creates a mathematical inconsistency. 

 NATIVE VISIONOS PLATFORM SUPPORT (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Apple's visionOS engineering team has created a PR to add native
visionOS platform support to the Godot engine, starting with a
foundational PR that uses iOS code and lays the groundwork for future
immersive VR capabilities.
