ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 RUNNING A MILLION-BOARD CHESS MMO IN A SINGLE PROCESS (33 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 One Million Chessboards is a chess MMO with a 1,000x1,000 grid of
chessboards where 150,000 players made over 15 million moves in 10
days, with pieces able to move between boards in real-time without
turns. The entire game runs in a single Go process that handles
millions of queries by using efficient data structures (dense arrays),
protobuf serialization, and smart client-server communication that
sends snapshots and move batches based on player position to minimize
bandwidth. 

 JAVASCRIPT STRING SLICE() CONSIDERED HARMFUL (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A bug was discovered in Attio's CSV importer when using JavaScript's
`slice()` method to truncate strings. It was causing gRPC errors when
it split Unicode characters (like flag emojis) in the middle of their
UTF-16 code units, resulting in invalid data being sent to their
database. The issue occurs because `slice()` operates on code units
rather than complete Unicode code points, so truncating "🇬🇧"
could result in incomplete character data like "🇬\uD83C". 

 BUILDING A LIGHTWEIGHT REACTIVE STATE MANAGER WITH JAVASCRIPT PROXIES
(6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 You can build a lightweight reactive state management system using
JavaScript Proxies, which automatically trigger UI updates whenever
state changes without requiring external libraries. This article goes
through a practical example of a media submission form where a Proxy
intercepts property assignments (like `mediaStateProxy.video = "url"`)
and automatically runs multiple UI update functions, removing the need
to manually call update functions throughout the codebase.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BALANCING AI DEPENDENCE: ENHANCING OR ERODING DEVELOPER SKILLS? (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While AI coding assistants boost developer productivity by automating
tasks, studies show that reliance on them can negatively impact
critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Devs may experience
skill atrophy as they depend on AI for explanations and solutions,
leading to a decline in debugging and documentation comprehension. 

 CTOS REVEAL HOW AI CHANGED SOFTWARE DEVELOPER HIRING IN 2025 (15
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI has changed software development, creating a need for developers
who are especially good at critical thinking and problem-solving
rather than just churning out code. CTOs are prioritizing skills like
system design, business context understanding, and the ability to
debug AI-generated code, which often looks perfect but contains subtle
flaws.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW SENTRY BUILT ANOMALY DETECTION FOR MONITORING DATA (SPONSOR) [9] 

 This blog post details how Sentry's AI/ML team developed a time
series anomaly detection system using Matrix Profile and Meta's
Prophet library [9]. Instead of traditional threshold and
percentage-based alerting, the ML-based system detects subtle and
complex anomalies in application data, in near real-time. Read the
blog [9] 

 WEBMCP (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 WebMCP brings the Model Context Protocol to web browsers, letting AI
assistants interact directly with web apps. It removes the need for
API key management and OAuth flows by embedding MCP servers within web
pages, using existing browser authentication and security. This allows
AI agents to access structured data through standardized JSON-RPC
interfaces and orchestrate workflows across multiple sites. 

 INTRODUCING SKIA GRAPHITE: CHROME'S RASTERIZATION BACKEND FOR THE
FUTURE (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Chrome has launched Skia Graphite, a new rasterization backend for
rendering graphics, specifically on Apple Silicon Macs. Graphite was
created to address performance limitations of the older Ganesh backend
and take advantage of modern graphics APIs like Metal, Vulkan, and
D3D12. 

 JANK PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Jank is a general-purpose programming language and Clojure dialect
that combines the interactive development experience of Clojure with
native compilation and minimal runtime overhead, using C++ and LLVM.
It allows devs to iterate rapidly in a REPL, integrate with native C++
code, and compile to efficient machine code.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PHRASE ORIGIN: WHY DO WE "CALL" FUNCTIONS? (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The programming term "call" in relation to functions has its origins
in library science. "Calling" a function initially referred to
"calling for" a subroutine from a library, similar to requesting a
book from a closed-stack library. This concept was present in early
computer programming contexts. Fortran II (1958) then popularized the
term "CALL" for transferring control to a subroutine. 

 THE EVOLUTION OF CACHING LIBRARIES IN GO (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 On-heap caches store data in the heap memory managed by Go's garbage
collector. Go caching libraries have progressed from early
mutex-protected maps to advanced libraries like Ristretto (2019),
which became dominant but had issues with breaking changes and
suboptimal performance on certain workloads. Theine was released in
2023 and implemented more efficient algorithms from Java's Caffeine
library, including adaptive W-TinyLFU for better hit rates.

QUICK LINKS

 TREE BORROWS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Tree Borrows is a refined alternative to Stacked Borrows that relaxes
restrictions on unsafe Rust code while maintaining memory safety and
enabling more compiler optimizations by organizing borrows in a
tree-like structure, leading to fewer rejected test cases and new
optimization opportunities. 

 JSONREPAIR (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 jsonrepair repairs invalid JSON documents by addressing common errors
like missing quotes, commas, and incorrect syntax. 

 CACHING (14 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A detailed overview of the fundamental principles and various
applications of caching in computer systems, from CPU caches to CDNs,
covering concepts like temporal and spatial locality, replacement
policies, and the role of caching in databases like Postgres and
MySQL. 

 AM I ONLINE? (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 You can reliably check for internet connectivity by making a quick
HTTP request to a publicly available endpoint like Google's
`http://google.com/generate_204`, which returns a 204 No Content
status.
