ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SEARCH LOGS FASTER THAN SONIC (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This blog post goes over the inner workings of log search engines and
explains how they achieve fast search speeds. It starts with a simple,
inefficient example using jq and bash, then progressively introduces
more sophisticated data structures like inverted indexes, Tries, and
Finite State Transducers (FSTs). FSTs are the most common choice in
production search engines due to their efficiency in handling prefix,
suffix, and infix searches. 

 A WEBASSEMBLY COMPILER THAT FITS IN A TWEET (18 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This is an article about creating a minimal JavaScript compiler that
converts reverse Polish notation expressions into WebAssembly
bytecode. It starts with an extremely compressed 192-byte version and
gradually de-obfuscates the code, explaining various JavaScript tricks
used for brevity. Through this process, insights into WebAssembly
structure, JavaScript optimizations, and compiler design are provided.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW I USE LLMS AS A STAFF ENGINEER (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A staff engineer at GitHub uses LLMs in his daily work primarily as a
powerful code completion tool and for fast prototyping. He also uses
LLMs for learning new technologies, as a tutor to clarify concepts and
check understanding, and for proofreading. Notably, he prefers not to
use them for bug fixing as he trusts himself more. 

 SEVEN THINGS I KNOW AFTER 25 YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT (11 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 After 25 years of coding, this developer has outgrown frameworks,
seen the failure of rigid methodologies, and has seen the increasing
scale of software overall. He recommends focusing on individual code
narratives ("stories") to fully understand code and software.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HAYSTACK CODE REVIEWER (WEBSITE) [8] 

 Haystack Code Reviewer makes pull request reviews easier by breaking
them into smaller, manageable parts. It uses an interactive canvas to
visualize changes, showing a before-and-after view of diffs. This
allows for a quicker understanding of the relationships between
modifications within a single pull request. 

 JSCANIFY (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Jscanify is a JavaScript document scanning library that uses
OpenCV.js. It supports paper detection, highlighting, and extraction
from images and video streams.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ORACLE JUSTIFIED ITS JAVASCRIPT TRADEMARK WITH NODE.JS—NOW IT WANTS
THAT IGNORED (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ryan Dahl, creator of Node.js, is petitioning to cancel Oracle's
"JavaScript" trademark, arguing that it is a generic term and that
Oracle's claim is based on fraudulent evidence (a Node.js screenshot).
Oracle's response attempts to dismiss the fraud claim by citing
another specimen, avoiding the core issue of trademark ownership over
an open standard. 

 WHAT REALLY HAPPENS INSIDE A DATING APP (50 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This blog post goes over the inner workings of a dating app and
learnings from them - both technical and nontechnical. The author
discusses user ranking systems, how simple like-to-pass ratios are
more effective than complex algorithms like ELO scores, and how user
behavior significantly differs between men and women. App retention is
heavily influenced by the feed algorithm, which must prioritize
personalization over simple recommendations to maximize user
engagement, particularly focusing on getting women to send likes and
men to receive them. 

 MY SEVENTH YEAR AS A BOOTSTRAPPED FOUNDER (17 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A bootstrapped founder sold his remote computer control company,
TinyPilot, for $600,000 to focus on family after the birth of his son.
He transitioned into creating educational products, initially revising
a blogging course and then shifting to writing a book on effective
writing for developers.

QUICK LINKS

 IT'S OK TO HARDCODE FEATURE FLAGS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Hardcoding feature flags is often a simpler, safer, and often
sufficient solution for teams early in development compared to using a
SaaS platform for them. 

 BEEJ'S GUIDE TO GIT (WEBSITE) [14] 

 A deep guide on Git that starts with the basics and then goes deeper
into its underlying mechanisms for a more comprehensive understanding.


 CHAT IS A BAD UI PATTERN FOR DEVELOPMENT TOOLS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Using chat interfaces for AI software development tools is
fundamentally flawed because software development requires precise,
documented specifications, not the ambiguity and lack of organization
inherent in chat conversations. 

 BUILD A LINK BLOG (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This author plans to create a link blog to share interesting
technical links with commentary and analysis.
