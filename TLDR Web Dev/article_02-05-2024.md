 IS THE ‚ÄúAI DEVELOPER‚Äù A THREAT TO JOBS ‚Äì OR A MARKETING STUNT?
(9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The recent hype around "AI developers" replacing software engineers
is a marketing strategy by startups trying to break into a market
dominated by Microsoft's GitHub Copilot. AI tools are still far from
replacing human developers, but these startups need to make bold
claims to get attention. While AI is changing how software is created,
fully replacing engineers will either never happen or is a long time
away. 

 THE SAFF SQUEEZE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The ‚ÄúSaff Squeeze‚Äù debugging technique is used to debug failing
tests. It involves progressively inlining parts of a failing test
until pinpointing the problematic logic. The result is a minimal
failing test, which then makes it easy to fix. 

 THE 150X PGVECTOR SPEEDUP: A YEAR-IN-REVIEW (17 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The PostgreSQL extension pgvector has sped up over 150x this past
year in its index build times. This is due to binary quantization
methods, which reduces index sizes. New indexing methods and
CPU-specific SIMD acceleration also helped increase query throughput
and reduced latency.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 3 CRITICAL SKILLS YOU NEED TO GROW BEYOND SENIOR LEVELS IN
ENGINEERING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Engineers need to develop a whole new set of skills to progress past
the senior engineer level. They need to learn to scale themselves,
navigate ambiguity, and influence without authority through
credibility and personal connections. 

 5 TIPS TO SUPERCHARGE YOUR DEVELOPER CAREER IN 2024 (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 To become a better developer in 2024, get better at using AI tools
like GitHub Copilot, use shortcuts often, and focus on soft skills.
It's best to use AI in a way that makes you more productive, for
example, by automating boilerplate code and finding bugs early.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DOKPLOY (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Dokploy is a free self-hostable platform that makes
application/database deployment and management easier. It can deploy
any type of application (Python, Go, Node.js, etc) along with all
major databases. Dokploy comes with real-time monitoring, docker
management, and Traefik integration for routing and load balancing. 

 PERPLEXICA (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Perplexica is an AI-powered search engine that searches the web and
understands your questions. It uses machine learning algorithms like
similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and cite
sources.

 MODERN ADVANCES IN PROMPT ENGINEERING (50 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Prompt engineering has evolved a lot and there are certain strategies
to get the most out of LLMs. Basic strategies include zero-shot,
few-shot, and instruction prompts, where users give the LLM a task
description (zero-shot) and a couple of examples (few-shot). Advanced
strategies include step-by-step reasoning with examples
(Chain-of-Thought prompting) and self-consistency, which is where
multiple reasoning paths are generated and then a majority vote is
taken for the answer. 

 WHAT DO ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AT MACHINE LEARNING? (17
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There needs to be a focus on MLOps for organizations to be great at
machine learning. This means that ML engineers should engage in data
work, feature engineering, model experimentation, evaluation,
deployment, and monitoring. Experimentation and evaluation should be
encouraged. Successful MLOps teams have high velocity, great
validation (early error detection), and good versioning practices.

 TERMINAL.SHOP (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Terminal.shop is an online coffee shop where you have to use SSH to
order coffee. 

 2023 MIGHT HAVE BEEN ‚ÄúPEAK OPEN INTERNET‚Äù (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sites allowing LLM bots to crawl them face a lose-lose situation as
they incur costs in serving bot requests without receiving traffic in
return while also subsidizing the training of a competitor's monetized
LLM model. 

 THE NULL/UNDEFINED PROPAGATION PROBLEM IN REACT APPS (2 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Excessive null/undefined value checking in React components is
difficult to deal with as a codebase grows, especially if the codebase
is poorly typed.
