 ✅ TESTING MILESTONES CHECKLIST (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When you're just starting out, you're barely testing at all. As you
start to think more about scale and rigor, tests become more habitual.
As your code and team mature, testing becomes a way of life.

Get this checklist by Codecov (Sentry) [4] to figure out:

 	* Which stage you're at
 	* What are the main challenges
 	* Which level of coverage you should be targeting

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE BUILT THE WORLD'S FASTEST VIN DECODER (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cardog built the world's fastest VIN decoder by optimizing the
NHTSA's VPIC database, which contains 40 years of vehicle data but
doesn't have performance optimization. It achieved this by stripping
regulatory metadata, removing unused patterns, and applying modern
SQLite optimization techniques, reducing the database size from 1.5GB
to 21MB. This resulted in a huge performance improvement, with
response times decreasing from 3.2 seconds to under 30ms and
eliminating network dependency. 

 PARSING PROTOBUF LIKE NEVER BEFORE (45 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 hyperpb is a new high-performance and runtime-dynamic Protobuf
parsing library for Go. It uses a dynamic approach, compiling code at
runtime to enable online profile-guided optimization for parsing
efficiency. This article goes over its architecture, focusing on its
VM-based parser, memory management, and unique optimizations like
zerocopy strings and arena reuse.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DEVELOPERS, NOT OPERATORS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI is not reinventing developers, and adopting AI tools is not the
only path to success. It's important that devs have the freedom to
choose their own tools and approaches. Software development is more
than just generating code quickly - it requires understanding
problems, designing solutions, and making architectural decisions. 

 HTML IS DEAD, LONG LIVE HTML (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The DOM and CSS are outdated and inefficient for modern web apps due
to their complexity, legacy issues, and the blurring of UI and
content. Common problems include the stringly-typed nature of the DOM,
CSS' inside-out approach to layout, and the inadequacy of text
manipulation APIs. Alternatives like "HTML in Canvas" and GPU-based
renderers are promising to look into. 

 IT'S TIME FOR MODERN CSS TO KILL THE SPA (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Modern CSS features like the View Transitions API and Speculation
Rules have made Single Page Applications (SPAs) largely unnecessary by
enabling smooth page transitions and instant navigation without
requiring heavy JavaScript frameworks. While SPAs were originally
adopted to create app-like experiences, browsers can now do what SPAs
do natively with simple CSS.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CLAUDE CODE IDE INTEGRATION FOR EMACS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Claude Code IDE for Emacs is an integration that allows the Claude
Code CLI to interact with Emacs' features through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP).  It provides a bidirectional bridge enabling Claude
to understand and leverage Emacs functionalities like LSP, project
management, and custom Elisp functions. The IDE comes with automatic
project detection, terminal integration, MCP tool support for
accessing Emacs commands, diagnostic integration, and advanced diff
views. 

 ELEVENLABS REACT NATIVE SDK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 The ElevenLabs Conversational AI SDK allows devs to integrate
interactive voice agents into React Native applications. It requires
React Native with LiveKit dependencies, microphone permissions, and
development builds for Expo compatibility. 

 STATICSEARCH (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 StaticSearch is a client-side JavaScript search engine designed for
static websites. It indexes website content to create JSON and
JavaScript data files for search functionality. The engine has a web
component for easy integration, along with modules and APIs for more
customized implementations.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WRITING A RUST GPU KERNEL DRIVER: A BRIEF INTRODUCTION ON HOW GPU
DRIVERS WORK (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article teaches the basics of GPU driver architecture, focusing
on the user-mode driver (UMD) and kernel-mode driver (KMD)
relationship using an example of rendering a rotating cube with Vulkan
(VkCube). The UMD translates high-level API commands into lower-level
GPU instructions, while the KMD manages memory allocation, job
scheduling, and hardware initialization. The Tyr driver, a Rust-based
KMD, provides an interface for device information, memory management,
job submission, and tiler heap management. 

 WHY BUILDING BILLING SYSTEMS IS SO PAINFUL (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There are many hidden complexities of building billing systems, far
beyond simple subscription models. Billing involves managing various
pricing models, real-time usage tracking, and adapting to changing
needs. Billing is not just invoicing, but a critical infrastructure
that impacts the entire business, so it often requires a specialized
team with expertise in both engineering and finance.

QUICK LINKS

 JULES, OUR ASYNCHRONOUS CODING AGENT, IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE
(1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Jules, an asynchronous coding agent powered by Gemini 2.5, is now
open to the public. 

 AI IN SEARCH: DRIVING MORE QUERIES AND HIGHER QUALITY CLICKS (4
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI-powered search features on Google are leading to more user queries
and a higher quality of clicks to websites, still in the range of
billions of clicks a day. 

 LOGICAL ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS IN JAVASCRIPT: SMALL SYNTAX, BIG WINS (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 JavaScript's logical assignment operators (`||=`, `&&=`, `??=`) offer
concise syntax for conditionally assigning values based on logical
checks (falsy, truthy, or nullish). 

 PGLINE (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 Pgline is a high-performance TypeScript PostgreSQL driver for Node.js
using pipeline mode with faster speed and lower CPU usage in
benchmarks compared to Bun SQL, Postgres.js, and node-postgres.
