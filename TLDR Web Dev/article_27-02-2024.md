ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FUTURE SOFTWARE SHOULD BE MEMORY SAFE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The White House Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) released
a report emphasizing the need to shift cybersecurity responsibility to
large tech companies and the government. The report urges the adoption
of memory-safe programming languages to prevent common vulnerabilities
and calls for better tools to measure software security. It uses C#,
Go, Java, Python, Rust, and Swift as examples of memory-safe
languages. C and C++ are considered non-memory-safe languages. 

 HOW QUORA INTEGRATED A SERVICE MESH IN THEIR BACKEND (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 A service mesh is a software layer that manages communication between
services in applications. It is a configurable infrastructure layer
that makes communication between microservice applications possible,
structured, and observable. Quora implemented a service mesh in its
backend to improve observability, reliability, and developer
productivity. Since the deployment of the service mesh, Quora has
successfully integrated hundreds of services, using features like
canary deployments and load balancing with precise traffic controls. 

 HOW TO FIND THE AWS ACCOUNT ID OF ANY S3 BUCKET (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new technique can discover the AWS Account ID associated with any
S3 bucket regardless of whether it is public or private. The technique
leverages the fact that CloudTrail logs will record requests permitted
by a VPC Endpoint policy but blocked by other policies. Whether AWS
account IDs are considered sensitive information is still up in the
air, but this technique could potentially be used to uncover other
resource identifiers beyond AWS account IDs.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ENGINEERING IS MORE ABOUT PEOPLE THAN TECH (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Software engineering prioritizes collaboration and communication over
isolated technical work. Success in engineering relies heavily on
teamwork, alignment, and knowledge sharing. Developing strong
interpersonal skills like empathy, active listening, and communication
is key to becoming a truly effective engineer. 

 GUIDE TO LEADING MEETINGS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meetings are often dreaded by engineers because they tend to be
time-wasting and unproductive. However, by taking proactive steps to
lead effective meetings, you can transform them into valuable
experiences that advance your career. The key to effective meetings is
meticulous preparation (defining goals, inviting the right people, and
clarifying expectations), skillful facilitation during the meeting
(stating the outcome, managing tangents, and ensuring everyone is
heard), and diligent follow-up (documenting decisions and summarizing
action items with deadlines). 

 DISILLUSIONED WITH DENO (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Deno's core team has taken on the monumental task of building
Deno-specific versions of common web development tools along with
implementing compatibility with the massive Node/npm ecosystem. This
strategy is unsustainable, as it leaves Deno perpetually behind Node
and fails to incentivize developers to create Deno-native packages.
Node.js is still the most viable long-term bet for backend development
in JavaScript as it is adopting Deno's best features and accounting
for the rise of non-JavaScript alternatives built on technologies like
WebAssembly.

 FRUGLY VS. FREEMIUM (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This author explored alternative monetization strategies for their
educational tool, wanting to balance accessibility with the need to
generate income. Rejecting traditional models like ad-supported
freemium, donations, or constant updates, they opted for "frugly
pricing" ‚Äì intentionally downgrading the UI's aesthetics for free
users while offering a paid option to remove the unappealing elements.


 THE 14 PAINS OF BUILDING YOUR OWN BILLING SYSTEM (7 MINUTE READ) [16]


 Billing systems are deceptively complex, making them a nightmare to
build and maintain in-house. Building your own billing system is not a
good idea due to problems like idempotency, tax handling, customer
hierarchy, and ever-changing regulations. Instead, offload as much of
the billing process as possible to third-party solutions so you can
focus on the core, unique aspects of your product. 

 12 LESSONS LEARNED FROM DOING THE 1BRC CHALLENGE (6 MINUTE READ) [17]


 The One Billion Row Challenge is a challenge that tests how fast one
billion rows can be aggregated from a text file. The fastest solutions
to the challenge relied on clever hacks (like unsafe memory access)
and specialized hardware/JVMs. Even without extreme optimizations,
substantial performance gains can be found through careful
implementation choices, such as file parsing, data structures, and
try-catch blocks. The challenge is a good exercise in the proper usage
of profiling and experimentation.
