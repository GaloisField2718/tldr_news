 WEBASSEMBLY FOR AI INFERENCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The Gcore engineering team decided to see what happens if they ran an
image classification model on their CDN infrastructure [4]. This white
paper has the full details of Gcore's experiment ‚Äî tuning a
WASM-at-the-edge environment for AI inference workloads. Bonus: there
are pictures of cats. Get the white paper here [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FIGMA'S JOURNEY TO TYPESCRIPT: COMPILING AWAY OUR CUSTOM PROGRAMMING
LANGUAGE (17 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma recently migrated its custom Skew programming language to
TypeScript, a move made possible by improved browser support for
WebAssembly and internal optimizations. This transition allows for
seamless integration with Figma's existing codebase and external
libraries, easier onboarding for new developers, and access to the
TypeScript developer ecosystem. In this article, the Figma engineering
team goes over their migration process, which was done gradually and
automatically so as to not disrupt developer workflows internally. 

 TIME-BASED CSS ANIMATIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Time-based CSS animations offer a new approach to creating animations
without using traditional keyframes. The technique uses a custom CSS
variable that tracks time in milliseconds, providing a way to
manipulate CSS properties in real time. This article goes over various
examples of such animations with code examples, showing off how to
control animation duration, frame rate, easing, and more with
precision.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WE CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT WEB (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The current web is dominated by large platforms and ads - much
different from the ‚Äúold web‚Äù which focused more on creativity and
community. To build a better version of the ‚Äúold web,‚Äù we could
build protocols that resist ‚Äúdigital toll booths‚Äù that are
established by businesses today. It'll take experimentation, but the
tools are there to build a more user-driven web again. 

 STAFF+ INTERVIEWERS, WHAT ARE THE REASONS YOU REJECT SOMEONE IN A
SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEW? (REDDIT THREAD) [8] 

 People are usually rejected in system design interviews due to their
inability to analyze and articulate trade-offs in design decisions.
They aren't able to explain their design choices clearly and justify
the pros and cons of each. Other rejected candidates try too hard to
find a single ‚Äúperfect‚Äù solution or overengineer their solution.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GITHUB COPILOT WORKSPACE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 GitHub Copilot Workspace assists developers throughout the entire
software development process, from brainstorming a project plan to
writing and testing code, using natural language. 

 STIRLING-PDF (GITHUB REPO) [10]

converting, etc.) within a locally hosted web environment. 

 I'M WRITING A NEW VECTOR SEARCH SQLITE EXTENSION (7 MINUTE READ) [11]


 SQLite-vec is a pure C SQLite extension that provides vector search
capabilities directly within SQLite databases. It offers custom SQL
functions and virtual tables for fast vector search and vector
manipulation.

 ARE RECRUITERS BETTER THAN A COIN FLIP AT JUDGING RESUMES? HERE'S THE
DATA (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A new study reveals that recruiters are only slightly better than a
coin flip at judging resumes and predicting which candidates will pass
technical interviews. They only correctly chose who to interview 55%
of the time and different recruiters often disagreed on the same
resume. Recruiters were found to subconsciously favor candidates from
top companies. Simple ML models trained on objective performance data
were found to be more accurate than human recruiters in predicting
interview success. 

 FIFTY YEARS OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEM (11 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Gary Kildall created the first successful commercial operating
system, CP/M, in 1974. His company, Digital Research Inc. (DRI),
established CP/M as an industry standard, but later lost out to a
Microsoft offering that copied its appearance and functionality.
Despite this, Kildall continued to innovate, contributing to the
development of important technologies such as CD-ROM encyclopedias and
early computer animation. 

 THREE THINGS WE LEARNED ABOUT APPLE'S AI PLANS FROM ITS EARNINGS (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 While Apple is investing heavily in AI across its product lineup, it
won't be building massive data centers to support it. Instead, Apple
will follow its typical 'hybrid' cloud approach, using third-party
services with its own infrastructure combined. Apple is expected to
announce more AI-powered features at WWDC in June.

without VPN" enabled, due to bugs in Android itself.
