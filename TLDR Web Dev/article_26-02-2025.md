ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW CORE GIT DEVELOPERS CONFIGURE GIT (17 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The series of Git configuration settings in this article are
categorized into "Clearly Makes Git Better," "Why the Hell Not?" and
"A Matter of Taste" - explanations and code snippets are provided to
enable each of them. Examples include improving branch and tag
listing, setting a default branch name, using a better diff algorithm,
and enhancing push/fetch behavior. There are also settings for
autocorrect prompting, committing with diffs, reusing recorded
resolutions, and nicer rebase configurations. 

 HOW WE MIGRATED 160,000 LINES OF JAVASCRIPT TO TYPESCRIPT—WITH ZERO
DOWNTIME (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 WorkMade successfully migrated a 160,000-line JavaScript banking
application to TypeScript with zero downtime over six weeks by using a
separate migration branch, periodic rebasing, and incremental typing.
It tested the TypeScript version in a staging environment with uptime
monitoring and mirrored the production environment before pushing the
changes to production. 

 WHY YOU SHOULD NOT PARSE LOCALIZED STRINGS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Parsing localized strings is problematic because the interpretation
of numbers and dates varies a lot across locales, leading to ambiguity
and errors. User device language may not reflect their intended input,
and multiple valid string formats can represent the same data. Locale
data also changes over time, leading to inconsistent results. Instead
of parsing, use dedicated input mechanisms or standard interchange
formats to handle user input and data exchange, respectively.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 IF IT IS WORTH KEEPING, SAVE IT IN MARKDOWN (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Digital content is prone to loss due to link rot, platform changes,
and even self-hosting failures. Valuable content should be preserved
in durable, easily accessible formats like plaintext Markdown so it
can last forever. 

 FREELANCING: HOW I GOT CLIENTS, PART 1 (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This developer became a successful freelancer by creating a
well-structured and quantified resume, preparing a quick verbal
presentation, understanding optimal timing for job searching based on
fiscal years, and using tools like Calendly and Briskine for
scheduling and efficient communication. In the resume, he addressed
the needs of potential clients and emphasized relevant experience for
those needs.

 REACT NATIVE BOOST (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 React Native Boost is a Babel plugin to automatically optimize React
Native applications through source code analysis. It identifies and
implements safe micro-optimizations by replacing React Native's View
and Text implementations with their native versions. 

 GOATDB (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 GoatDB is a real-time, version-controlled NoDB designed for Deno and
React ideal for prototyping and lightweight deployments without
complex backends. It has features like client-side operation,
resilience, real-time collaboration, and edge-native processing.
GoatDB uses React hooks for state management and provides easy server
setup with automatic sync. 

 XONSH (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Xonsh is a cross-platform, Python-powered shell that blends Python
3.6+ syntax with familiar shell commands.

MISCELLANEOUS

 I WENT TO SQL INJECTION COURT (15 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A bill (SB0226) is being considered by the Illinois General Assembly
to address whether public bodies can hide information from Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) requests by storing it in databases. This bill
was prompted by Matt Chapman's FOIA request for the City of Chicago's
parking ticket database (CANVAS) schema, which was denied due to
security concerns. Chapman sued, bringing in the author of this
article as an expert witness to argue that releasing the schema
wouldn't jeopardize the system, but despite winning at trial and
appellate court, the Illinois Supreme Court ultimately sided with the
city, defining a schema as a file layout, which is exempt. 

 THE DEEP RESEARCH PROBLEM (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI's Deep Research is designed to make research and analysis
easier, but it often falls short of expectations due to inaccuracies
and unreliable data sourcing. For example, a sample report on
smartphone adoption rates contained flawed data from sources like
Statcounter and Statista, leading to incorrect conclusions. The core
issue lies in asking a probabilistic model a question that requires
deterministic accuracy. 

 A PEEK INTO A POSSIBLE FUTURE OF PYTHON IN THE BROWSER (10 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Python-like code will be able to be run efficiently in web browsers.
SPy is a research project that aims to create a "Python-friendly"
language that compiles to native binaries or WebAssembly. It was used
to accelerate a generative art demo in PyScript by pre-compiling code,
achieving a 100x performance improvement.

QUICK LINKS

 HARD PROBLEMS THAT REDUCE TO DOCUMENT RANKING (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Complex problems, particularly in offensive security such as N-day
vulnerability analysis, can be solved by reframing them as document
ranking problems and using LLMs for listwise document ranking. 

 CHICORY (WEBSITE) [17] 

 Chicory is a pure Java, easy-to-integrate, secure JVM-native
WebAssembly runtime that allows applications to use plugins within a
sandboxed environment. 

 BOOST YOUR WEBSITE SPEED (10 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A slow-loading website can hurt user experience, reduce search engine
rankings, and decrease conversions. 

 ASK HN: FORMER DEVS WHO CAN'T GET A JOB, WHAT DID YOU END UP DOING
FOR WORK? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [19] 

 Former developers talk about what they're up to now, from working as
electricians to retiring.
