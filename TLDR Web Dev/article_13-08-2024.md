ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DON'T GET CAUGHT BY SURPRISE: UNDERSTANDING THE READ AFTER WRITE
PROBLEM (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The "Read After Write" problem arises when a service attempts to read
data immediately after writing it, but the changes may not be
reflected in all nodes of the database yet. This is a common problem
in distributed systems. This article goes over different database
replication strategies, in terms of latency and data consistency. It
suggests potential solutions, such as retrying reads, reading from the
primary node, and accepting occasional inconsistencies depending on
the application's requirements. 

 HOW TO BUILD SCALABLE AI APPLICATIONS (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Building useful scalable AI applications requires developers to have
good data preparation (data cleansing and management) and use
retrieval-augmented generation. Models used should be pre-trained or
fine-tuned. Custom models can be developed in-house, but usually will
require a large amount of capital. Developers should be mindful of
latency, memory, compute, caching, and other factors to make sure the
user experience is good.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GO IS MY HAMMER, AND EVERYTHING IS A NAIL (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Markus, a solo developer, uses a single programming language, Go, for
all his projects. This allows him to move faster as he has the deepest
understanding of the language, and so doesn't have to context switch
across languages as much. Furthermore, as he develops, he continues to
specialize in Go, which gives him more opportunities in the future. 

 DISTRIBUTED == RELATIONAL (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Distributed systems are naturally relational. Function invocations in
distributed systems can be implemented as triggers on relational
tables, where data updates trigger function executions. This model
allows for efficient parallel processing, eliminates the need for
manual coordination between systems, and makes writing code easier. 

 REPAIR AND REMAIN (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Instead of always seeking new beginnings, it's useful to ‚Äúrepair
and remain‚Äù by fixing what's broken first. It's not easy to just
stay put, but embracing the slow, hard work of staying put can be
useful.

 POSTGRES.NEW: IN-BROWSER POSTGRES WITH AN AI INTERFACE (15 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Supabase has launched postgres.new, an in-browser Postgres sandbox
with AI assistance. This tool utilizes PGlite, a WASM version of
Postgres, allowing users to spin up databases directly in their
browser. postgres.new also has AI-powered features, such as
drag-and-drop CSV import, report generation, charting, and ER diagram
creation. 

 WHIRL (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Whirl is a collection of CSS loading animations. It offers a variety
of pre-made animations that you can easily incorporate into your web
projects through copy-paste. 

 NOW IN BASELINE: ANIMATING ENTRY EFFECTS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Browser engines now support two new CSS features, `@starting-style`
and `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`, that create entry
animations for elements that animate from `display: none`, including
those animating into the top layer.

 HISTORY OF HACKERNEWS SEARCH: FROM 2007 TO 2024 (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This blog post chronicles the evolution of HackerNews' search
functionality from its inception in 2007 to the present. It highlights
three distinct generations of search engines: early independent
efforts, Octopart/ThriftDB-powered HNSearch, and the current
Algolia-powered system. 

 PIECING TOGETHER AN ANCIENT EPIC WAS SLOW WORK. UNTIL A.I. GOT
INVOLVED (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Scholars have been working for over a century to piece together the
Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the world's oldest literary texts, from
fragments of clay tablets. The task is daunting, as there are hundreds
of thousands of tablets and only a handful of experts in cuneiform.
However, a new AI project called Fragmentarium is accelerating the
process, allowing researchers to match fragments and discover new
segments of Gilgamesh at a much faster rate. This has already led to
the discovery of hundreds of missing words and lines. 

 HERE'S HOW PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY USING AI (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI companions may exploit emotional bonds in humans and become
‚Äúaddictive intelligence.‚Äù A lot of people are using AI as a
companion, friend, or to act as characters. This creative usage for AI
is booming, but also can be addictive, as seen in the Character.AI
subreddit when the platform goes down.
