 CALCULATING A/B TEST RESULTS USING STREAM PROCESSING ‚Äî ADEVINTA
TECH BLOG (SPONSOR) [6] 

 The Adevinta engineering team manages dozens of high-traffic
marketplace websites. Their engineering blog on Medium [7] is a great
resource for anyone who‚Äôs dealing with web data at scale.
For example, a recent article covers Adevinta‚Äôs streaming approach
to A/B test results calculation [8]. Most platforms do this in batch;
but for larger websites, this means aggregating billions of data
points over and over again, with exponential costs. Can it be done in
pure streaming?

Read the blog post [6] to see the solution, or check out the latest
articles on the Adevinta tech blog [5].

 EXPLORING THE ANIMATION LANDSCAPE OF 2023 WRAPPED (5 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Spotify enhanced its Spotify Wrapped experience for users in 2023 by
introducing a web-based version. It used animations to add vibrancy
and personality to data stories. Traditionally, native builds were
used for animations on Android and iOS, but in 2022, Spotify
introduced Lottie, a JSON-based animation format, to streamline
animation creation and achieve visual parity across platforms. Both
native animations and Lottie were employed in 2023 Wrapped, with
Lottie being used for generic animations and native animations for
user-specific data visualizations and interactions. 

 12 MODERN CSS ONE-LINE UPGRADES (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 12 one-line CSS upgrades that will help reduce technical debt, remove
unnecessary lines of JavaScript, and score easy wins for user
experience. Examples include pairing `object-fit` with `aspect-ratio`
to ensure images are not distorted when you apply a custom aspect
ratio and using `width:fit-content` over `display: inline-block` to
reduce an element‚Äôs width to the content size - this maintains the
same effect while leaving the display value available, thereby not
changing the position of the element in the layout.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DEFINING OUR ICP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE EVER DID (7 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Defining an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is critical for startups.
Having a clear ICP is crucial for achieving product-market fit as it
helps in targeting the right customers and shaping the product,
marketing, and sales strategies accordingly. Startups should define
their ICP early and continuously refine it as they gather more
relevant data and recognize genuine enthusiasm from potential
customers. 

 HOW TO GROW PRODUCT-MINDED ENGINEERING TEAMS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A product-minded engineer can build products more efficiently by
focusing on the features that matter and avoid over-engineering. These
engineers understand the broader goals of the company, bridge
communication gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders,
and make data-driven decisions. Teams with product-minded engineers
often hire the right individuals, establish a collective vision,
promote collaboration between engineering and product teams, and
provide innovative solutions.

 APPLE IS BRINGING SIDELOADING AND ALTERNATE APP STORES TO THE IPHONE
(6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Apple is set to introduce significant changes to its iPhone app
ecosystem in March in response to the European Union's Digital Markets
Act. iOS users in the EU will be able to download apps from
third-party app stores. Developers can choose whether to use Apple's
payment services or integrate third-party payment systems. Apple is
introducing a hefty Core Technology Fee for developers that integrate
third-party payment systems or distribute their apps on third-party
app stores. It will charge developers ‚Ç¨0.50 (around 54 US cents) per
annual app install. This fee only kicks in after a million annual
installs in the EU. 

 HOW DOES VISA/MASTERCARD MAKE MONEY? (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The credit card is often called the "most profitable product in
banking" because it generates significant revenue through the payment
flow process. When a cardholder pays a merchant $100 using a credit
card, the merchant compensates the acquiring bank with a "merchant
discount fee." The acquiring bank then keeps a portion (e.g., $0.25)
as the acquiring markup and pays the issuing bank an interchange fee
(e.g., $1.75) to cover the transaction. The issuing bank incurs costs
like managing accounts, fraud detection, and clearing, which justify
its compensation. Card networks like VISA charge banks for their
services, but the interchange fee may vary for different merchants,
typically being higher for smaller merchants.
