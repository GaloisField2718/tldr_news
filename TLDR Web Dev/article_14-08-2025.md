ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FIGHTING WITH YOUTUBE TO SHOW A PREVIEW IMAGE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A method for displaying YouTube video previews on a webpage
efficiently delays the loading of the full video iframe until the user
clicks the preview. The standard approach of using YouTube's thumbnail
URL can fail because the highest resolution image isn't always
available, and YouTube's fallback image triggers the onload event
instead of onerror. The solution involves checking the image size in
the onload handler to determine if the fallback image is loaded, and
then iterating through lower resolution thumbnails until a valid one
is found. 

 HUNTING A MEMORY LEAK (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DoltHub discovered a memory leak in its Dolt SQL Server after a
customer reported steadily growing memory usage. While it used Go's
memory profiling tools to investigate the issue, it found that the Go
heap wasn't actually growing. Instead, the memory leak was occurring
in kernel space, so the root cause was related to file system
operations rather than application memory management. 

 BETTER CSS LAYOUTS: TIME.COM HERO SECTION (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article rebuilds the Time.com hero section layout using advanced
CSS techniques. It goes over various approaches to creating a more
flexible and responsive design, including CSS Grid, container queries,
display contents, and the :has() selector. The goal is to make the
layout adapt to different content types and viewport sizes without
early switching to mobile view.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 REFLECTIONS ON THE REACT COMMUNITY (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 After a decade of experience with React, this ex-Vercel employee says
that it's hard to maintain a large open-source community. The React
team struggles to actively engage due to the overwhelming amount of
feedback. 

 WHAT WE LEARNED FROM CREATING POSTCSS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The creators of PostCSS, a CSS automation tool with 400 million
monthly downloads used by major companies like Google and Wikipedia,
share lessons learned from 12 years of maintaining the open-source
project. Successful open-source projects require a lot of time
investment in documentation and promotion, comparable to the actual
coding effort. They recommend directly approaching potential users to
suggest adopting your library. 

 MCP VULNERABILITIES EVERY DEVELOPER SHOULD KNOW (14 MINUTE READ) [10]


 MCP has risks like tool description injection, weak authentication,
and supply chain poisoning, which can lead to data leaks, code
execution, and compromised systems. Real-world incidents involving
exposed servers, data breaches, and command injection show that these
are already problems that need solving.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TERRAGON (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Terragon is a platform that allows devs to easily run AI agents like
Claude Code and OpenAI Codex in the cloud. It provides isolated dev
environments, Git workflows, cross-platform access, monitoring,
automation, and security features to help developers plan, build,
review, test, and ship code faster. 

 EMBEDDING ATLAS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Embedding Atlas is a tool developed by Apple that provides
interactive visualizations for large embeddings, enabling users to
visualize, cross-filter, and search embeddings and metadata. It has
features like automatic data clustering and labeling, real-time
search, and WebGPU implementation for fast performance.

MISCELLANEOUS

 I WANT EVERYTHING LOCAL – BUILDING MY OFFLINE AI WORKSPACE (6
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 InstaVM is a completely offline AI workspace that runs locally
without cloud dependencies to address privacy concerns. The system
combines local LLMs (via Ollama), sandboxed code execution using
Apple's container tool, and headless browser automation (Playwright)
to create an isolated environment for tasks like video editing, data
analysis, and research. 

 WE CAUGHT COMPANIES MAKING IT HARDER TO DELETE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
ONLINE (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Many data brokers are hiding instructions on how consumers can delete
their personal data from search engines, despite California law
requiring them to provide deletion options. These companies use code
to prevent search engines from indexing the pages, making it difficult
for consumers to find and exercise their privacy rights. After being
contacted, some companies removed the code, while others defended the
practice or did not respond. 

 $160M VC-BACKED COMPANY JUST KILLED MY EU TRADEMARK FOR A SMALL OSS
PROJECT. IS IT EVEN WORTH FIGHTING? (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A small open-source project developer lost their EU trademark for
"Deepkit" to a $160M-backed company, "Deepki," due to failure to
demonstrate sufficient "genuine use" within the EU. The developer's
provided data, including Google Analytics and download statistics, was
rejected for lacking specific location data connecting usage to the
EU. Now, the developer questions whether it is worth appealing the
decision in the EU or fighting the US registration, especially
considering the cost and the project's small scale.
