 THE ROOTS OF TODAY'S MODERN BACKEND ENGINEERING PRACTICES (13 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Backend practices in software engineering have seen significant
changes over the years. In the early days of the internet, backend
development involved rudimentary tools like shell scripting, Perl, and
hand-rolled C-code, with version control systems like CVS. Amazon,
then a startup, ran its entire operation on a single DEC AlphaServer,
using basic methods like symlink flipping for code updates.
Eventually, as tech companies started growing faster and getting
larger, it was necessary to start implementing distributed systems to
handle increasing demand. 

 HOW A 3RD PARTY API CAN RUIN YOUR WEEKEND (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This is a story of how a critical microservice that depends on a
3rd-party API failed and caused a disruption for over two weeks. The
API suddenly failed one day, and because the handling of API events
was not done in real time, the failed events piled up, reaching the
API limit and causing many events to be dropped. The post dives into
the lessons learned from the incident, such as automating re-runs of
failed jobs, involving other teams more, and establishing an on-call
rotation earlier. 

 CREATING A BESPOKE LLM FOR AI-LARGENERATED DOCUMENTATION (9 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Databricks recently announced an AI-generated documentation feature,
using large language models (LLMs) to automate documentation for
tables and columns, with over 80% of the company‚Äôs table metadata
updates now AI-assisted. A bespoke LLM was developed by two Databricks
engineers in one month for under $1,000 in compute costs, resulting in
high quality, fast throughput, and low costs. This new model, MPT-7B,
fine-tuned on around 3,600 examples, addresses issues of documentation
in data platforms and demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of
creating custom LLMs for specific tasks.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW LARGE PULL REQUESTS SLOW DOWN DEVELOPMENT (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Complex codebases lead to change amplification, where simple changes
require modifications in multiple places, slowing down the process.
Research on 1.5 million pull requests showed that the number of files
changed in a pull request (PR) correlates with the time taken to merge
it. To minimize complexity and enhance efficiency, it's recommended to
keep PRs small, limit them to three or fewer file changes, and use
strategies like stacking if possible. 

 TAKE YOUR TIME MAKING DECISIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It‚Äôs important to take time to make consequential decisions, rather
than responding under pressure or panic. While quick action has its
place, big decisions rarely require instant responses. Instead, be
prepared, consider the best alternatives, and make decisions with a
substantial amount of information rather than wait for perfect
information.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TRACE (WEBSITE) [10] 

 Trace allows developers to create SwiftUI components and screens for
mobile apps with natural language. The application allows for the
iterative development of iOS apps in the browser, along with the
ability to export files to Xcode for further development. 

 INTRODUCING THE NEXT GENERATION OF AWS AMPLIFY‚ÄôS FULLSTACK
DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A new generation of AWS Amplify, an AWS backend platform, has been
released. It transitions Amplify to a code-first DX, allowing
developers to succinctly express app requirements like data models,
business logic, and authorization rules in TypeScript. Core new
features include Typescript and monorepo support, per-developer cloud
sandbox environments, a unified Amplify console, and the ability to
use AWS CDK code inline. 

 INTRODUCING STABLE VIDEO DIFFUSION (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 StabilityAI has released Stable Video Diffusion as open-source.
Stable Video Diffusion can create videos using generative AI. This
post shows various demos of the model in action.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SAM ALTMAN TO RETURN AS CEO OF OPENAI (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Sam Altman is returning as CEO of OpenAI five days after an attempted
coup by the company‚Äôs board. The OpenAI board is being overhauled
and now seats Bret Taylor (former CEO of Salesforce), Larry Summers
(Former United States Secretary of the Treasury), and Adam D'Angelo
(CEO of Quora and already a current member of the OpenAI board). 

 HOW I (KIND OF) KILLED MERCURIAL AT MOZILLA (24 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Firefox is transitioning from Mercurial to Git for version control.
The Mozilla source code, initially stored in a CVS repository since
1998, moved to Mercurial in 2007, a time when distributed version
control systems (DVCS) like Git and Mercurial were just emerging. The
choice of Mercurial was largely influenced by Git's subpar performance
on Windows at the time. Over the years, as Git gained popularity and
GitHub became a major platform for open-source projects, more Mozilla
developers began using Git. As a result, Mozilla decided to finally
move over to Git to keep up with current developer trends.
