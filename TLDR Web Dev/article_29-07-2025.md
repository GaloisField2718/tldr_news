ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE USELESS USECALLBACK (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 `useCallback` and `useMemo` are often misused, leading to unnecessary
complexity and overhead without actual performance gains. This article
goes over scenarios where memoization is pointless, such as when
passing props to non-memoized components or using props directly as
dependencies within `useCallback` or `useEffect`. A real-world
example is shown from the Sentry codebase to illustrate how seemingly
memoized values can be invalidated by non-memoized dependencies. 

 A FRIENDLY INTRODUCTION TO SVG (21 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SVG is an image format with XML syntax that allows for dynamic
manipulation with CSS and JavaScript. It offers UI primitives like
circles, rectangles, and polygons, and their attributes can be styled
and animated. This post explains presentational attributes like
`stroke` and `stroke-dashoffset`, which are useful for creating
animated effects like drawing shapes. A key concept explained is the
`viewBox` attribute, which creates an internal coordinate system that
allows SVGs to scale properly and remain responsive, solving the
problem of fixed positioning that occurs when using absolute
coordinates. 

 ADDING .MD URLS FOR RAW MARKDOWN CONTENT IN NEXT.JS (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 It's possible to add ".md" URLs to a Next.js blog to serve raw
markdown content. This solution uses Next.js rewrites for efficient
URL mapping, directing requests for ".md" files to a dedicated API
route. The API route then retrieves the raw markdown content from
Content Collections and returns it with appropriate headers, including
caching instructions.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SIX PRINCIPLES FOR PRODUCTION AI AGENTS (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Building production-ready AI agents requires clear and detailed
system prompts, strategic context management to avoid overwhelming the
model, and carefully designed tools with straightforward interfaces.
Robust feedback loops using domain-specific validation are also
required to catch errors. LLM-driven error analysis is useful to
identify system blind spots. 

 WHEN SOFTWARE ENGINEERS THINK THEY NEED MORE FOCUS TIME (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Software engineers often mistakenly prioritize uninterrupted coding
time over other important aspects of their job, like collaboration and
communication. An engineer's primary responsibility is creating impact
and delivering value, not solely writing code. The most valuable work
often happens outside the IDE, such as participating in meetings,
writing documentation, and helping teammates. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FLOWGRAM (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 FlowGram is a node-based flow building engine for creating workflows
with fixed or free layout modes. It is best for visual workflows with
clear inputs and outputs, and it aims to integrate AI capabilities. 

 GITMCP (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 GitMCP is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed
to eliminate code hallucinations in AI tools by providing them with
access to up-to-date documentation and code from GitHub projects. It
supports both specific repository and generic server access, allowing
AI assistants like Cursor to fetch relevant information.

 GO AT AMERICAN EXPRESS TODAY: SEVEN KEY LEARNINGS (6 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Since adopting Go in 2016, American Express has learned multiple
lessons that shaped its successful enterprise implementation. It
created standardized frameworks and toolkits to support non-functional
requirements, used Go's built-in performance tools, and successfully
integrated with its observability stack. The company also spent time
training internal engineers, leading to nearly a thousand engineers
forming a thriving internal Go community. 

 I DESIGNED MY OWN RIDICULOUSLY FAST GAME STREAMING VIDEO CODEC (14
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 PyroWave is a fast, low-latency video codec designed for local game
streaming. This codec focuses on simplicity, removing motion
prediction and entropy coding for speed and error resilience, using
intra-only compression and discrete wavelet transforms. Benchmarks
show faster encoding and decoding speeds compared to standard codecs
like H.264/HEVC/AV1 under similar constrained conditions.

 HOW TO MAKE WEBSITES THAT WILL REQUIRE LOTS OF YOUR TIME AND ENERGY
(3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Things like indiscriminate dependency usage, premature framework
adoption, and complex compilation steps maximize the time and energy
required to build a website. 

 SIGN IN WITH GOOGLE IN CHROME (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google gives Chrome an advantage by displaying "Sign in with Google"
prompts differently than other browsers, allowing them to be disabled
in Chrome's settings while bypassing extension-based blocking methods.
