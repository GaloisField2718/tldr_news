ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 A FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING BROWSER SUPPORT (18 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This blog post presents a framework for deciding whether to use new
CSS features based on browser support. The framework considers three
factors: the fallback experience if the feature isn't supported, the
actual browser usage statistics for the specific audience (which may
differ from global averages), and the potential harm caused by a
broken experience for unsupported browsers. Devs can simulate
unsupported browsers by temporarily removing the CSS declaration to
assess the fallback and use `@supports` for custom fallbacks when
necessary. 

 THE ANATOMY OF A REACT ISLAND (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 React Islands are used to incrementally modernize web applications by
integrating React components into existing, statically rendered
projects. This approach avoids the pitfalls of complete rewrites by
allowing for a piecemeal transition. React Islands involve creating
self-contained React components, declaring them in a separate build
target, and then calling them from the main HTML, passing data via
props and using a shared context for performance.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I LEARNED REACT NATIVE AS A WEB DEVELOPER, AND I GOT EVERYTHING WRONG
(5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A web developer transitioning to React Native initially prioritized
custom UI components, which resulted in apps that lacked the familiar
and polished feel of native apps. They eventually switched to using
native iOS and Android UI elements, pre-built components that offer a
polished, platform-consistent experience. 

 PYTHON DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT IS A DUMPSTER FIRE (57 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Python dependency management is difficult because there are too many
tools and no standardized approach. The core problem stems from the
need to manage both Python-specific packages and system-level
dependencies, often requiring multiple tools and increasing the chance
of conflicts. Good dependency management relies on version control,
environment isolation (like virtual environments), and the use of
definition and lock files for reproducibility. 

 SAFE VS. ALL-IN: THE TWO FACES OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The “Safe Engineering Manager” focuses on stability, harmony, and
meeting expectations, while the “All-In Engineering Manager”
pushes boundaries, challenges norms, and deeply invests in outcomes
and people. These approaches often clash, as one values calm
consistency and the other thrives on relentless passion and change.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CALI (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Cali is an open-source AI agent that uses a large language model to
simplify React Native app development. It provides tools for build
automation, device management, dependency management, and more. 

 ESLINT PLUGIN PERFECTIONIST (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 The ESLint plugin Perfectionist automatically sorts various code
elements (imports, objects, types, etc.) alphabetically, naturally, or
by line length. 

 INTRODUCING REACT NATIVE SCREENS 4.0.0 (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 React Native Screens 4.0.0 introduces improved sheet API support on
Android and iOS, preload support for native-stack screens, better iOS
animations, support for React Navigation v7, and support for the new
React Native versions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DENO V. ORACLE: CANCELING THE JAVASCRIPT TRADEMARK (3 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Deno has filed a petition with the USPTO to cancel Oracle's trademark
on “JavaScript,” arguing that the term has become generic, Oracle
misrepresented evidence during trademark renewal, and the trademark
has been abandoned. If successful, this would remove legal barriers,
allowing the community to freely use the term “JavaScript” without
restrictions. 

 WHY AM I WRITING A JAVASCRIPT TOOLCHAIN IN ZIG? (10 MINUTE READ) [13]


 This developer is building a new JavaScript toolchain called Jam in
Zig to address shortcomings in existing tools like ESLint and webpack.
Jam aims to improve performance through data-oriented design and
compile-time optimizations. It uses Zig's comptime features for
efficient AST processing and uses a stricter, opinionated code
formatter. 

 BEHIND THE PLATFORM: THE JOURNEY TO CREATE THE LINKEDIN GENAI
APPLICATION TECH STACK (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 LinkedIn's journey of building a GenAI application tech stack began
in early 2023. It initially used a Java-based midtier but transitioned
to a Python-based framework using LangChain for both offline
development and online serving. Prompt management evolved from simple
string interpolation to a standardized system using Jinja templates
and a prompt source of truth.

QUICK LINKS

 HACKERRANK WAS BROKEN - BUT NOW IT'S ACTUALLY HARMFUL (4 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 HackerRank and similar platforms are now inadvertently rewarding
proficiency in using AI to solve problems rather than genuine software
engineering ability, leading to flawed hiring processes. 

 NOTHING IS SOMETHING (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Unlike search engines which return nothing when lacking sufficient
information, LLMs produce inaccurate but seemingly plausible
responses, making "nothing" more helpful than the misleading
"something" they provide. 

 PYTHON TYPE HINTS MAY NOT BE FOR ME IN PRACTICE (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Python's optional type hints are often impractical for this
developer's typical small projects because the effort of defining and
updating types outweighs the benefits. 

 AVOIDING FALSE POSITIVES IN NODE.JS TESTS (9 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Common causes of false positives in Node.js tests include using loose
equality comparisons, overly general assertions, shallow equality for
deep comparisons, misunderstanding assertion behavior, forgetting to
call matchers, misusing mocks, and incorrect regex matching.
