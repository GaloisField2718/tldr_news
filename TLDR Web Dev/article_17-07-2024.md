 IDEA ‚è© PRODUCTION: USING VISUAL DEVELOPMENT AND AI TO SHIP 10X
FASTER (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Does shipping digital experiences quickly mean compromising on
quality? Not necessarily. AI and visual development create new ways to
build, iterate upon, and optimize applications and websites.
This live session will cut through the hype [4] and provide a
realistic view of how traditional CMS architecture misses the mark and
how emerging technologies address long-standing challenges:

> How visual development + AI [4] can dramatically accelerate your
workflow

> The power of Generative UI and Structured UI [4] in modern web
development

> Real-world examples [4] of organizations shipping digital
experiences 10x faster

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REBUILDING A 10 YEAR OLD IOS APP WITH EXPO (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This developer rebuilt a 10-year-old iOS app using Expo, adding
Android and TV support along the way. They successfully replicated the
original app's functionality using Expo and React Native packages,
avoiding the need for custom native code. The new UI design used
responsive layouts for different devices, and the app was built and
submitted using EAS Build and Submit. 

 DOMAIN LOGIC (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 React projects often suffer from messy architecture due to the
framework's unopinionated nature. This article focuses on domain
logic, which is code that operates on domain models like user objects.
The goal is to isolate domain logic from components and move it to a
dedicated domain layer, improving code readability, testability, and
reusability. 

 WHY GERMAN STRINGS ARE EVERYWHERE (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 German Strings, designed for data processing, are a custom string
type that optimizes for short, immutable strings. Unlike C or C++
strings, German Strings store short strings directly in place and
include a prefix for faster comparisons. Long strings are stored with
a pointer, length, and prefix, but without extra capacity for
appending. German Strings also have three storage classes: temporary,
persistent, and transient.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 REVIEW YOUR OWN PRS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 You should review your own pull requests (PRs) in the GitHub UI to
catch mistakes and improve code quality before involving other team
members. This practice helps identify issues that might be overlooked
in the code editor and allows for more productive and focused code
reviews. Add comments to PRs to explain design choices and alternative
solutions tried before sending them out for review. 

 STORY POINTS ARE POINTLESS, MEASURE QUEUES (35 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Story points, used to estimate effort in Agile development, are
unreliable due to their relative nature and inherent variability.
Velocity, which converts story points into time, further worsens this
problem by creating unrealistic deadlines and discouraging teams from
exceeding expectations. A better approach is to break down projects
into smaller tasks, creating queues, and tracking the average task
rate, which provides a more reliable way to project completion times
and adjust for scope changes. 

 DEVS NEED SYSTEM DESIGN TOOLS, NOT DIAGRAMMING TOOLS (9 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Engineering teams often face a problem when choosing system design
tools: they focus on the solution (diagramming tools) rather than the
underlying problem (understanding and communicating complex systems).
System design is a continuous process that goes beyond diagrams and
includes documenting requirements, architecture, and decisions. Modern
software systems are too complex for traditional diagramming tools,
which lack real-time updates, collaborative features, and the ability
to manage cloud resources.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CODESTRAL MAMBA (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Codestral Mamba is a new open-source model designed to improve code
productivity. Unlike Transformer models, it has linear time inference
and the ability to model infinite length sequences. It can be used as
a local code assistant and deployed using the mistral-inference SDK or
TensorRT-LLM. 

 AWS SECRETS MANAGER AGENT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 The AWS Secrets Manager Agent is a client-side HTTP service that can
be used to standardize the consumption of secrets from Secrets Manager
across environments such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Elastic Container
Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, and Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud. The Secrets Manager Agent can retrieve and cache secrets in
memory so that your applications can consume secrets directly from the
cache. That means you can fetch the secrets your application needs
from the localhost instead of making calls to the Secrets Manager. 

 EIDOS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Eidos is an extensible framework for managing personal data
throughout its lifetime in one place. It runs in the browser and has
offline support and local AI features.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPTIMIZING A BIGNUM LIBRARY FOR FUN (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This author initially implemented a bignum library using base-10
digits, but it was slow. They then optimized it by switching to 30-bit
digits, which improved memory efficiency and arithmetic operations.
This change resulted in an 83% faster addition and a 99% faster
multiplication. 

 THE GOLDEN AGE OF SCAMMERS: AI-POWERED PHISHING (14 MINUTE READ) [15]


 AI-powered phishing scams that use generative AI to automate and
personalize attacks are on the rise. These attacks can easily bypass
traditional phishing defenses by creating realistic and targeted
messages. Security measures exist to combat this threat, like DMARC,
multi-layered security, and continuous education on recognizing
phishing attempts. 

 AI LAB: THE SECRETS TO KEEPING MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEERS MOVING FAST
(7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI Lab is a pre-production framework at Meta that continuously A/B
tests common ML workflows to proactively improve and prevent
regressions on Time to First Batch (TTFB), a key metric for ML
engineer productivity.

QUICK LINKS

 I AM STARTING AN AI+EDUCATION COMPANY (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Andrej Karpathy has announced a new AI+Education company, Eureka
Labs, which aims to create an AI-powered learning platform where
students can learn from high-quality course materials guided by AI
Teaching Assistants. 

 IN PRAISE OF SMALL PULL REQUESTS (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Small, focused pull requests that do exactly one thing each are
easier to review, less likely to have merge conflicts, easier to
rollback if something goes wrong, and lead to more accurate
descriptions and increased code coverage. 

 AGILE MANIFESTO CO-AUTHOR ON MAKING PROCESS 'BEACON OF HOPE' (5
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Jon Kern, co-author of the Agile Manifesto, criticizes a recent
report on Agile failure rates, arguing that it misrepresents Agile
principles and promotes excessive processes that obscure the original
spirit of the Manifesto. 

 MIGRATING COINBASE'S 56 MILLION USERS TO REACT NATIVE: KEY LESSONS
AND TAKEAWAYS (43 MINUTE VIDEO) [20] 

 An ex-Coinbase employee discusses performance challenges faced when
using React Native at Coinbase, including re-rendering issues and
solutions implemented, as well as platform-specific optimizations
between iOS and Android.
