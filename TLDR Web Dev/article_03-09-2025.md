 STRUCTURED LOGS + APPLICATION CONTEXT = FASTER DEBUGGING (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Debugging a failed API call means jumping between your error tracker,
log aggregator, and APM tool to piece together what happened. Sentry
Logs [5] eliminates the context switching by bringing logs directly
into the same view as your errors and traces.

🧐 See the retry loops and API timeouts that led to that 500 error.

👨‍💻 View structured logs [5] filtered by _customer_id_ or
_payment_id_ right alongside stack traces.

⚡️ Connect logs to distributed traces to understand slowness
across services.

💪 Do it all without leaving Sentry!

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE FASTEST SITE IN THE TOUR DE FRANCE (29 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 An analysis of the web performance of bike manufacturer websites
participating in the 2025 Tour de France was done using a proprietary
CrRRUX score based on Core Web Vitals. Merida, Factor, and Giant were
the fastest, while Ridley, Orbea, and Trek ranked the slowest, showing
a disconnect between brand prestige and website speed. The analysis
also went into the technical aspects of each site, highlighting issues
like render-blocking resources, client-side rendering, and unoptimized
images. 

 HOW TO PROTECT YOUR AI AGENT FROM PROMPT INJECTION ATTACKS (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Prompt injection attacks are a new class of security vulnerabilities
that exploit LLMs by manipulating their natural language processing
abilities, similar to SQL injection attacks. There are six design
patterns proposed by researchers to protect AI agents from these
attacks, each with different "guardian" components that act as
security checkpoints at various stages of the AI pipeline. These
patterns include Action-Selector (using predefined safe actions),
Plan-Then-Execute (creating fixed plans before processing untrusted
data), LLM Map-Reduce (isolating data processing), Dual LLM
(separating privileged and quarantined models), Code-Then-Execute
(sandboxed execution), and Context-Minimization (removing potentially
malicious inputs from memory). 

 THE CORE OF RUST (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Rust has a strong, coherent vision at its core, built around
interwoven concepts like pattern matching, generics, traits, and the
borrow checker that all work together by design. While this makes Rust
difficult to learn initially, it also makes the language powerful once
one grasps how these features complement each other. This is different
than languages like JavaScript, where you can accomplish tasks without
understanding the entire language.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FIRST ATTEMPT WILL BE 95% GARBAGE: A STAFF ENGINEER'S 6-WEEK JOURNEY
WITH CLAUDE CODE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A staff engineer goes over their six-week journey using Claude Code,
revealing a messy integration process into production development. The
AI initially produces mostly garbage code, but with iterative
refinements and contextual data, it becomes a workable starting point.
By managing multiple AI instances like a team of developers with
limited memory and focusing on architecture and review, the engineer
ships features 2-3x faster with a large ROI. 

 NO, YOU DON'T WANT TO HIRE "THE BEST ENGINEERS" (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The pursuit of hiring "the best engineers" is often unnecessary, and
even hurtful, for startups.  Demanding the absolute top talent
creates unrealistic expectations that lead to lengthy, unproductive
searches. Companies should instead focus on identifying great
engineers and be willing to compromise on certain criteria to secure
valuable hires sooner. 

 NEXT.JS IS INFURIATING (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This dev was frustrated with Next.js, particularly concerning
production-ready logging. In this post, he goes over the difficulties
he had while trying to implement logging using middleware and
AsyncLocalStorage, as there are limitations in Next.js's middleware
system. He had to create an elaborate workaround involving passing
data through headers to achieve logging in pages and layouts, which he
finds unnecessarily complex.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TERMIX (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Termix is an open-source, self-hosted server management platform with
a web-based interface for managing servers and infrastructure. It
provides features like SSH terminal access, SSH tunneling, remote file
editing, and server stats monitoring. The platform supports user
authentication with admin controls, OIDC, and 2FA. 

 CORNERSTONE 3D (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Cornerstone is a set of JavaScript libraries designed for building
web-based medical imaging applications, including radiology tools like
the OHIF Viewer. It uses WebGL for high-performance rendering and
WebAssembly for fast decompression.

 GOOGLE STOCK JUMPS 8% AFTER SEARCH GIANT AVOIDS WORST-CASE PENALTIES
IN ANTITRUST CASE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's stock increased 8% after a federal judge issued a ruling in
its antitrust case. The judge decided Google would not be forced to
sell Chrome or its Android operating system. However, Google will be
barred from exclusive contracts but can still pay for preloaded
products. The company must also make certain search index and user
interaction data available. 

 WE FIRED OUR PROMPTS — AND HIRED AN AGENT TO BUILD OUR FORMS (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Monday.com initially used a prompt-to-form feature that translated
natural language into structured forms using a single LLM call, but
this approach ended up being brittle and lacked the ability to iterate
on forms. To address this, they developed an AI agent that combines an
LLM with memory, structured tools, and a controlled execution flow for
collaborative and iterative form building. The agent uses specific
tools, mimicking human actions, and allows users to modify and refine
forms through natural language prompts.

MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic has secured $13 billion in Series F funding, led by ICONIQ,
at a post-money valuation of $183 billion, with its run-rate revenue

 CONVERSATION: LLMS AND BUILDING ABSTRACTIONS (16 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Successful use of LLMs requires a shared domain vocabulary developed
through collaboration between domain experts and technical experts. 

 PYTHON HAS HAD ASYNC FOR 10 YEARS -- WHY ISN'T IT MORE POPULAR? (15
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Despite being available for 10 years, Python's async functionality
hasn't achieved widespread popularity due to limited use cases
(primarily network I/O), the constraints of the Global Interpreter
Lock (GIL), and the challenges of maintaining both synchronous and
asynchronous APIs. 

 ASK HN: IS YOUR COMPANY STILL HIRING JUNIOR ENGINEERS? (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [19] 

 When asked if companies are still hiring junior engineers, many
Hacker News commenters report a broken hiring system with fraud and
inflated skill claims, making it difficult for genuine talent to stand
out, while others avoid junior hires due to perceived replacement by
LLMs or concerns about training and retention.
