ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BALANCING TEXT IN CSS (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Balanced text makes web pages look better. New CSS features, such as
text-wrap: balance and text-wrap: pretty, provide native solutions for
text wrapping by evenly distributing content across lines or
addressing orphan words easily. However, they still have some
limitations, like line count constraints and spacing issues. 

 HOW CLOUDFLARE MITIGATES THOUSANDS OF DDOS ATTACKS EVERY HOUR (7
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cloudflare mitigates an average of 2,200 DDoS attacks per hour. It
measures attack size using metrics like bits per second (BPS),
requests per second (RPS), and packets per second (PPS), analyzing
attack vectors, targets, and payload signatures to identify and
fingerprint attacks. Cloudflare has multiple protection strategies,
like rate limiting, caching, CDNs, reducing attack surface, continuous
monitoring, and machine learning. 

 AUTOMATED ACCESSIBILITY TESTING AT SLACK (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Slack implemented automated accessibility testing using Axe,
integrating it with their Playwright E2E framework to identify WCAG
violations. They had initial challenges integrating Axe directly into
their React Testing Library, but were able to successfully implement a
system where accessibility checks run alongside existing tests,
reporting critical violations. The full process includes a custom
Playwright fixture to simplify test creation and uses an environment
flag to control test execution on-demand, scheduled, and with CI.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MISTAKES ENGINEERS MAKE IN LARGE ESTABLISHED CODEBASES (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Working in large, established codebases is challenging, requiring
skills not learned in smaller projects or open source contributions.
The most important skill is maintaining consistency by following
existing code patterns and avoiding isolated, "clean" implementations.
Understanding the codebase's production usage, particularly
high-traffic areas, is also really important, as is careful testing
and monitoring due to the impossibility of exhaustive testing. 

 17 TIPS FROM A SENIOR REACT DEVELOPER (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A senior React developer at Palantir shares 17 tips for React,
advising new engineers to build projects, read a lot of code, and be
careful of mindlessly following online advice. He also shares
practical development techniques to optimize bundle size, keep
components simple, and keep code maintainable when working in teams. 

 MAGIC/TRAGIC EMAIL LINKS: DON'T MAKE THEM THE ONLY OPTION (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The increasing use of "magic links" (email login links) as the sole
authentication method is annoying. While they offer improved security
over passwords, they present significant usability issues for users
with multiple devices. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NODE.JS NOW SUPPORTS TYPESCRIPT BY DEFAULT (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Node.js version 23 will natively support TypeScript, allowing users
to run `.ts` files without extra configuration. Node does this by
stripping type information using swc before execution. However, type
checking must be done separately using `tsc`. 

 ADMINFORTH (WEBSITE) [12] 

 AdminForth is a Node and Vue-based open-source framework for building
customizable and secure admin panels quickly. It has features like
user management, AI autocomplete, audit logging, and 2FA. 

 21ST.DEV (WEBSITE) [13] 

 21st.dev is an open-source registry of React UI components built with
Tailwind CSS and Radix UI, allowing users to easily publish and
install components with npx shadcn.

 APPLE AND THE AI DIVIDE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There's a growing divide between companies enthusiastically
integrating AI into their products and a public increasingly wary of
AI's ethical implications and potential misuse. Apple's rushed
adoption of AI features is an example of this disconnect. 

 HOW AIRBNB BUILT A KEY-VALUE STORE FOR PETABYTES OF DATA (8 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Airbnb's derived data infrastructure evolved from HFileService, a
read-only batch processing system, to Nebula, which combined batch and
real-time data but suffered from inefficiencies and complexity. To
overcome these challenges, Airbnb developed Mussel, a scalable,
low-latency key-value store using technologies like Apache Helix,
Kafka, and HRegion to handle real-time and batch data seamlessly.
Mussel now supports over 130TB of data with high availability and
sub-8ms read latency. 

 LAID OFF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY CAREER, AND TWICE IN ONE YEAR (10
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This developer was laid off twice within a year, first during
paternity leave and then shortly before Christmas. Both experiences,
though initially shocking and emotionally challenging, led to new job
searches. The developer goes over their job hunting strategies,
including how they networked, sent out targeted applications, and
refined their resume.

QUICK LINKS

 MICROSOFT IS USING BING TO TRICK PEOPLE INTO THINKING THEY'RE ON
GOOGLE (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Microsoft is using a Bing search interface mimicking Google's
homepage to subtly encourage users to stick with Bing and Edge instead
of switching to Google and Chrome. 

 HIPSCRIPT (WEBSITE) [18] 

 HipScript is an online compiler for HIP and NVIDIA® CUDA® code to
WebGPU. 

 THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN SOFT SKILLS IN THE AGE OF AI (4 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 As AI continues to improve, developers can future-proof themselves by
focusing on core soft skills like communication, adaptability, and
collaboration, which AI cannot replicate. 

 HOW CAN I MOST EFFECTIVELY PUSH BACK AGAINST MANAGEMENT ALWAYS TRYING
TO PUT MORE AND MORE ON MY PLATE? (REDDIT THREAD) [20] 

 A mid-level software engineer at a FAANG company seeks advice on how
to effectively push back against management's constant addition of
unplanned, high-priority tasks that disrupt their workflow - responses
recommend managing expectations for these tasks with their manager or,
in the worst case, switching teams/companies.
