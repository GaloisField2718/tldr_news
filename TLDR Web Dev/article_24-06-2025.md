 IMPLEMENTING MULTI-TENANCY INTO A NEXT.JS SUPABASE APP (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you're building something team-based—think workspaces, orgs, or
shared dashboards—you've probably bumped into the “how do I handle
multi-tenancy?” question.

Good news: Clerk just dropped a guide showing how to do this with
Supabase + Next.js using Postgres RLS. No custom auth hacks, no messy
logic.

In the guide, you'll see how to:

	* Set up org-based access with minimal config
	* Use Clerk's organizationSwitcher to manage context
	* Keep your database logic simple and secure with RLS
	* Avoid the usual headaches around auth and permissions

It's clear, practical, and you'll walk away with code you can actually
use.

👉 Read the guide. [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 GIT NOTES: GIT'S COOLEST, MOST UNLOVED­ FEATURE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Git notes are a lesser-known Git feature for adding metadata to
commits, blobs, and trees without modifying the original objects. It
can be used to track time spent on commits, add review information,
and even enable fully distributed code reviews. 

 IMPLEMENTING AN UNDO/REDO SYSTEM IN A COMPLEX VISUAL APPLICATION (25
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article goes over the design and implementation of a
context-aware undo/redo system for Alkemion Studio, a complex visual
application for TTRPGs. The main challenge was handling user
interactions across multiple contexts, requiring a system that
prevents undoing actions outside the user's current view to avoid
confusion and data loss. The solution involves Action Classes with
undo/redo functions, organized into Action Volumes managed by a
central ActionStore singleton, and using a global Action Context to
determine valid actions. 

 GETTING CONDITIONALLY (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Devs often don't understand the cache control mechanisms that CDNs
rely on, which can lead to unnecessary costs from CDN providers who
offer tools to compensate for improper caching. CDNs are sophisticated
caching proxies that use conditional GET requests and Cache-Control
headers. Properly implementing Cache-Control headers is more important
than relying on complex CDN features.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW I USE MY TERMINAL (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post goes over a developer's customized terminal workflow
centered around tmux for better code editing and navigation. They use
tmux to search scrollback for filenames, open selected files in new or
existing nvim instances (even remotely), and manage editor sessions. 

 SKIP THE EXIT INTERVIEW WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR JOB (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Don't be candid in exit interviews when leaving a job. There's no
personal benefit to being negative, as it can damage your reputation
and create enemies. Be gracious and positive. 

 MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF GLEAM (21 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Gleam is a statically-typed language similar to Elixir. This
developer is building a parser for old AIM logs to learn the language.
It has some unexpected constraints like the absence of loops and
traditional control flow. However, its pipeline syntax is enjoyable,
along with its example-centric documentation. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 EFFECT-TS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Effect-TS is a TypeScript framework for building apps using
functional programming principles. It has a monorepo structure with
various packages extending its core functionality, including utilities
for AI, CLI, clustering, platform-specific runtimes, and SQL database
integrations. 

 LANGGRAPH FOR COMPLEX WORKFLOWS (20 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 LangGraph is an LLM workflow orchestration library that helps
developers build complex, multi-step automations using graph-based
architectures with strong support for parallel processing. It supports
structured responses, tool calling, and agent-based workflows that can
cycle between LLM invocations and tool executions until completion.
Unlike LangChain's DAG-based approach, LangGraph can handle cyclic
workflows and parallel execution, making it useful for orchestrating
multiple specialized LLM instances or creating automation pipelines
that don't necessarily require LLMs at all.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A DIFFICULT UPDATE ABOUT HYTALE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Hypixel Studios is stopping development on Hytale due to the game's
inability to meet its ambitious vision after years of effort and a
major engine reboot. The decision was made after exploring all
options, including reducing scope, but ultimately compromising the
game's core identity was deemed unacceptable. 

 AN ORAL HISTORY OF BANK PYTHON (20 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 "Bank Python" is a proprietary Python ecosystem used in major
investment banks. These systems often have a global database of Python
objects, a system for managing financial instrument dependencies, a
bank-wide job runner, and a table library for efficient data
manipulation.

QUICK LINKS

 INTERESTING BITS OF POSTGRES GRAMMAR (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This post goes over interesting and unusual aspects of PostgreSQL
grammar, including custom operators, precedence with compound selects,
percent types, string continuation, quoted identifiers, unicode
escapes, and operator functions. 

 USING AWAIT AT THE TOP LEVEL IN ES MODULES (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Top-level await, introduced in ES2022, allows the `await` keyword to
be used outside of async functions at the top level of ES modules. 

 COMPARATOR (WEBSITE) [17] 

 A free, private, in-browser tool that helps you compare job offers
and project potential outcomes of the equity received. 

 GITHUB CEO: MANUAL CODING REMAINS KEY DESPITE AI BOOM (4 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says that manual coding is still required
because developers still need to modify and refine AI-generated code.
