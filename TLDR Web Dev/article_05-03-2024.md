ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 JSDOC AS AN ALTERNATIVE TYPESCRIPT SYNTAX (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 TypeScript has become the default language of choice as web
development has embraced static typing during the past decade.
However, there are times when you don‚Äôt want to use TypeScript,
whether due to tooling constraints, longer setup and compile time, or
a team member who does not like static typing. JSDoc is a good
alternative as it can be understood by the TypeScript compiler and
lets you take advantage of some of the benefits of static typing
without needing a single .ts file. This post serves as a crash course
in using JSDoc as an alternative syntax for TypeScript and covers the
important TypeScript-related features. 

 CONSOLE.DELIGHT (23 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Developer consoles in web browsers offer more than just text logging.
You can use the %c format specifier to insert CSS, SVG, and even
limited HTML directly into console.info() or console.log() output.
This opens up possibilities for stylized text, animated graphics, and
interactive elements right in the console. While there are
limitations, like no external images or event listeners, this
technique offers a unique way to enhance debugging and add surprises
for curious users. 

 THE HUNT FOR THE MISSING DATA TYPE (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Graphs are powerful data structures, but they lack first-class
support in most programming languages. This is due to the sheer number
of design choices involved in representing graphs, as well as the
importance of performance in graph algorithms. Graph libraries often
try to balance flexibility and performance, but this can be difficult
as different algorithms work best with different representations. As a
result, using graphs often requires developers to make difficult
trade-offs or implement custom solutions.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW I KEEP MYSELF ALIVE USING GOLANG (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This author leverages their experience with software incident
management to manage their Type 1 diabetes. They use various tools and
technologies to monitor blood glucose levels, contextualize readings,
and create alerts to gain better visibility into their condition.
These tools are integrated into an incident management system that
allows them to receive notifications and even escalate alerts to
designated contacts when blood glucose reaches dangerous levels. 

 JAVA IS BECOMING MORE LIKE RUST, AND I AM HERE FOR IT! (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Java is evolving to incorporate concepts popularized by Rust, such as
immutable data structures by default and algebraic data types. These
changes were inspired by Rust's emphasis on compile-time safety
guarantees. Developers can now define immutable records in Java.
Java's new sealed interfaces and exhaustive switch syntax enable the
use of algebraic data types so that code handles all possible states
of a variable in a type-safe manner. 

 BLAMELESS CULTURE SHOULD BE A STANDARD IN THE ENGINEERING INDUSTRY (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Engineering teams should practice blameless culture. Assigning blame
to negative incidents can hinder collaboration and growth. Mistakes
should be treated as a team responsibility. A blameless culture
creates psychological safety as opinions are valued, allowing lessons
to be learned from incidents and encouraging collaboration.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 STOP RELEASING BUGS WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [15] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested [15]
before shipping. But how do you get that kind of coverage? You either
spend years scaling in-house QA ‚Äî or you get there in just 4 months
with QA Wolf. [16]
24-hour maintenance. On-demand test creation. Unlimited parallel test
runs. Zero flakes guaranteed. What‚Äôs not to like? Get a quick demo
here [16]

 PUTER (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Puter is an open-source desktop environment that runs in a web
browser. It is designed to be feature-rich, exceptionally fast, and
highly extensible. Puter can be used to create remote desktop
environments and serve as an interface for various services, including
cloud storage, remote servers, and web hosting platforms. 

 UBICLOUD (WEBSITE) [18] 

 Ubicloud provides cloud services on bare metal providers, such as
Hetzner, OVH, or AWS Bare Metal. You can set it up yourself or use its
managed service. Ubicloud aims to offer an open alternative to cloud
providers while reducing costs.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CSS FOR PRINTING TO PAPER (10 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 CSS offers control over the printed appearance of web pages,
including page size, margins, and repeating elements across multiple
pages. The @page rule sets printing defaults (often Letter size with
zero margins), while the @media print query hides on-screen elements
during printing. To ensure predictable layouts, it's best to manage
margins within the DOM using padding rather than the @page rule's
margin. JavaScript can be used when creating multi-page printouts to
dynamically generate elements while ensuring headers and footers
repeat correctly on each page. 

 JAVASCRIPT RUNS THE WORLD‚ÄîMAYBE EVEN LITERALLY (5 MINUTE READ) [20]


 JavaScript is the world's most widely used programming language
thanks to its beginner-friendliness and supportive development
community. Its unconventional design choices remain a source of
criticism, but continuous improvements in compilers and the ecosystem
have enhanced its performance and utility. 

 BUGS I‚ÄôVE FILED ON BROWSERS (3 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Web developers can directly contribute to improving browser
compatibility by filing detailed bug reports. An analysis of bug
reports across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit confirms that browser
teams are receptive, with high fix rates for valid bugs.
Interestingly, the data suggests that cross-browser compatibility has
improved over time, potentially due to efforts like the Interop
project.

 MAKING META (102 MINUTE PODCAST) [22] 

 Andrew Bosworth, the CTO of Meta, speaks about how Meta‚Äôs success
stems from a blend of a top-down vision from Mark Zuckerberg and a
bottom-up execution culture that encourages employees to contribute,
question, and share ideas. 

 INCREASE TEST FIDELITY BY AVOIDING MOCKS (2 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Use real dependencies or high-fidelity fakes when unit testing, as
using mocks reduces test effectiveness by potentially masking
discrepancies between test behavior and the actual production code. 

 LEAVING LINKEDIN CHOOSING ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE OVER EXPEDIENCY (43
MINUTE READ) [24] 

 An engineer left LinkedIn because the company‚Äôs culture prioritized
expediency over principled engineering.
