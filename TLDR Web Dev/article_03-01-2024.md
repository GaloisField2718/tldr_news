ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BACK TO BASICS: 5 HTML ATTRIBUTES FOR IMPROVED ACCESSIBILITY AND USER
EXPERIENCE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article covers five HTML attributes that can improve
accessibility and user experience. `hreflang` is useful for specifying
the language of linked resources, `translate` controls element
translation, `reversed` is for reversing ordered lists, `controls`
adds video or audio playback controls, and `autocomplete` allows
automatically completing form values. When used properly, these
attributes provide a more accessible and usable web experience for
users. 

 WHAT IS API LATENCY? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 API latency is the amount of time it takes for an API to respond to a
request. Elevated API latencies are usually caused by network issues,
server overload, inefficient code, third-party dependencies, and
geographic location. In terms of best practices for measuring and
testing API latency, it‚Äôs useful to account for both queue time and
service time, consider a wide variety of scenarios, set SLAs
(Service-Level Agreements), and use code profilers.

Pages for routing, Components for component overview,
Imports/Composables for composable information, Asset Management for

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DOCS DESERVE MORE RESPECT (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Without documentation, your users are on their own and must fend for
themselves. This will mean fewer success cases, poorer views of your
product, unhappy users, and a negative impact on your brand or
company. To write good docs, it‚Äôs important to use simple language,
tell a story when possible for engagement, ensure searchability, and
test documentation with real users for accuracy. 

 WHY I USE ASTRO (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Astro is a stable, simple, flexible, and lightweight web framework.
It allows for static site generation, supports Markdown, and provides
the option to add client-side JavaScript only when necessary, not by
default.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

progressively enhance HTML with lightweight JavaScript libraries. 

 HOOK (GITHUB REPO) [12]

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY ARE TECH REPORTERS SLEEPING ON THE BIGGEST APP STORE STORY? (17
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Antitrust scrutiny and regulatory pressure on Apple and Google's app
stores are opening up opportunities for competing web browsers to
challenge the mobile app duopoly. There is the potential for browsers
to enable Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and directories of PWAs as
alternatives to traditional app stores. Currently, both Google and
Apple employ strategies to limit the capabilities of competing
browsers, but regulation may change that soon. 

 THE I IN LLM STANDS FOR INTELLIGENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI-generated security reports have become a challenge for bug bounty
programs, as some users utilize AI tools to create reports that may
appear genuine, but are ultimately invalid or nonsensical. There is a
need for better mechanisms to detect AI-generated content, especially
as the quantity of it will exponentially grow in the future. 

 A NEW APPROACH TO LOCAL MULTIPLAYER / SPLITSCREEN PERSPECTIVE WITH
RAYTRACING (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Raytracing can be used to screen-share in local multiplayer games.
More specifically, dynamically adjusting the camera at a pixel level
using raytracing allows for smoother transitions between player
perspectives. A history of split-screen gaming along with a video demo
of the idea is available in the article.

 LLMS AND PROGRAMMING IN THE FIRST DAYS OF 2024 (19 MINUTE READ) [16]

aren‚Äôt as beneficial for programmers who aren‚Äôt as proficient at
writing code. 

 POSTGRESQL IS THE DBMS OF THE YEAR 2023 (4 MINUTE READ) [17]

 WHY 37SIGNALS ABANDONED THE CLOUD (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Clouds make sense for startups and enterprises who either don‚Äôt
know how much infrastructure they‚Äôll need or have a lack of
expertise in certain areas. However, for many companies, it‚Äôs
cheaper to run servers in-house instead.
