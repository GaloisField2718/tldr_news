 YOU DON'T NEED A WHOLE NEW DATABASE FOR AI (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You used to be able to run your entire app on a SQL database. But
with RAG and AI, you need vector search capabilities—and managing a
separate vector database is a pain.

Skip the juggling act with MongoDB Atlas [4]:

✅ Native vector search so you can build, scale, and run AI
apps—all in one database

✅ Flexible schema with a document model that maps directly to
objects in your code

✅ Fully managed on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud (125+ regions
available)

✅ Trusted by more than 57,100 customers worldwide

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE MULTI-REPOSITORY TYPESCRIPT PROBLEM (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 While monorepos can easily share TypeScript types across services,
polyrepos face complex issues with type synchronization, version
management, and the "recursive type discovery problem," where
extracting types reveals cascading dependencies and naming conflicts.
Tools like ts-morph programmatically extract and compare types across
repository boundaries. 

 MAKING SENSE OF THE PERFORMANCE EXTENSIBILITY API (8 MINUTE READ) [6]


 The Performance Extensibility API is a new Chrome feature that allows
devs to create custom tracks and markers in Chrome's Performance panel
using versions of `performance.mark()` and `performance.measure()`.
Specific parts of applications can be instrumented to capture metadata
about runtime performance with better visualization than the default
timing tracks.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DEVELOPERS, REINVENTED (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GitHub's CEO writes about how the developer role is being reinvented
due to AI. These developers are moving through stages, from initial
skepticism to becoming AI collaborators and strategists, focusing on
delegation and verification rather than direct coding. AI will
probably write a significant portion of code in the near future,
leading to a transformation where their value lies in orchestrating AI
agents and innovating beyond implementation. 

 NO, AI IS NOT MAKING ENGINEERS 10X AS PRODUCTIVE (19 MINUTE READ) [8]


 AI is not making engineers 10-100x more productive due to human
processes and bottlenecks involved in software development. AI hype
often comes from biased sources like investors or bosses creating
precarity. True engineering value lies in preventing unnecessary work,
not just faster coding. 

 AGENTIC CODING THINGS THAT DIDN'T WORK (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most of this dev's attempts at complex agentic workflows didn't
stick, leading him to delete failed automations and simplify his
approach. His most effective workflow ended up being 95% just talking
to the AI through speech-to-text and providing more context, rather
than using elaborate slash commands, hooks, or print mode features.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 OPEN MODELS BY OPENAI (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI has released two new open-weight reasoning models,
gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, designed for various use cases and
deployment environments. These models are licensed under Apache 2.0,
making them customizable and suitable for commercial use, with
features like agentic task capabilities and full chain-of-thought
access. 

 HARMONY (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 OpenAI uses the Harmony response format in its `gpt-oss` open-weight
model series, which enables structured conversation outputs. The
company has provided a Rust-based core with Python bindings for
rendering and parsing the Harmony format. 

 CLAUDE OPUS 4.1 (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Anthropic has released Claude Opus 4.1, an upgraded version of Claude
Opus 4 with improvements in agentic tasks, real-world coding, and
reasoning capabilities. This new model achieves a coding performance
of 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified and is great at precise code correction
and debugging.

 INJECTING JAVA FROM NATIVE LIBRARIES ON ANDROID (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 On Android, accessing advanced phone capabilities like Bluetooth or
certain network features from Rust requires using the Java SDK via JNI
because the NDK and Libc lack direct APIs. While JNI allows calling
Java from Rust, traditionally, creating new Java classes from Rust was
thought to be impossible. However, using `DexClassLoader`, Rust
libraries can compile and inject necessary Java classes at runtime,
making them more modular and easier for other developers to use. 

 HOW FAR CAN WE PUSH AI AUTONOMY IN CODE GENERATION? (27 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Thoughtworks experimented with generative AI to autonomously build a
Spring Boot application using strategies like reusable prompts and
reference applications. While the AI could generate simple
applications, issues came up with increasing complexity, including
adding unintended features, making incorrect assumptions, and
declaring success despite failing tests. Human oversight was essential
for high-quality, maintainable code. 

 2025 STACK OVERFLOW DEVELOPER SURVEY (WEBSITE) [15] 

 The Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey collected data from over
49,000 developers across 177 countries, focusing on technology usage,
AI trends, and developer satisfaction. There is increasing AI tool
adoption, with 84% of developers using or planning to use them, but
also declining positive sentiment towards AI and distrust in its
accuracy. Python's adoption has significantly grown, while Visual
Studio Code and Visual Studio remain the top IDEs.

 GENIE 3: A NEW FRONTIER FOR WORLD MODELS (17 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google DeepMind's Genie 3 is a new, real-time world model that
generates diverse and interactive environments from text prompts,
allowing users to navigate and interact within consistent, simulated
worlds. 

 WHY IS GITHUB UI GETTING SO MUCH SLOWER? (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The increasingly slow performance of GitHub's user interface is due
to inefficient client-side routing and excessive DOM node rendering. 

 YOU CAN SPOT BASE64 ENCODED JSON, CERTIFICATES, AND PRIVATE KEYS (3
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A trick to visually identify base64 encoded JSON is that they start
with "ey", while certificates and private keys start with "LS" within
files. 

 TAMBO (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Tambo is a React package that lets devs build AI-powered apps with
generative UIs by registering React components and tools for use by
LLMs.
