ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 YOUTUBE EMBEDS ARE BANANAS HEAVY AND IT'S FIXABLE (5 MINUTE READ) [5]


 YouTube embeds are excessively large, consuming 1.3 MB of data and
making 32 requests even on an empty page. However, the problem can be
fixed by using a lightweight web component like `lite-youtube`, which
replicates the appearance and functionality of YouTube embeds while
reducing resource usage and improving page speed. 

 HOW UBER MINIMIZES FLAKY TESTS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Uber developed Testopedia to manage its large suite of tests. It's
used to track test statistics and categorize tests based on their
stability. Testopedia uses a bucketing algorithm to handle test
queries and uses a sliding window algorithm to identify flaky tests. 

 HOW TO ANNUL PROMISES IN JAVASCRIPT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 JavaScript doesn't natively support canceling Promises. You can use
`Promise.withResolvers()` to create cancelable tasks by manually
resolving or rejecting Promises. Alternatively, `AbortController` can
handle early rejection, which can be used for cancelable fetch
requests and sequential request handling in React.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GOOD PROGRAMMERS WORRY ABOUT DATA STRUCTURES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Linus Torvalds emphasizes the importance of data structures over code
in software development since good data structures lead to better code
design and maintainability. This author supports this view with
personal experience, describing how restructuring data in a project
allowed the team to move faster in the long run. This prioritization
is also how Git grew to be the dominant version control system. 

 PRODUCT THINKING (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Product thinking is a valuable skill for engineers as it helps them
understand the impact of their work and prioritize tasks properly.
It's a skill that should be added to an engineer's ‚Äútalent stack‚Äù
to help them become well-rounded engineers. 

 ADVANTAGES OF INCOMPETENT MANAGEMENT (23 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sometimes incompetent management can actually offer advantages in
terms of resource allocation and project autonomy. In poorly run
companies, the lack of clear objectives and performance evaluations
can let employees pursue their own goals. Conversely, well-run
companies with strict performance metrics and resource management
inadvertently stifle such initiatives, as employees prioritize meeting
pre-set targets over exploration.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A REAWAKENING OF SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING MEETUPS (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There has been a resurgence of high-quality systems programming
meetups in 2024, such as the Munich Database Meetup and NYC Systems
meetup. Pre-pandemic meetups were often only product-focused, while
these new meetups are more technical in nature. While meetups are a
lot of work to organize properly, there is a growing interest in
in-depth technical discussions within the systems programming
community. 

 HOW TO THINK IN WRITING (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 To refine thinking through writing, start by making definite claims
and avoid ambiguity. Then, unfold your ideas by exploring the
reasoning behind them, even if it means revealing your ignorance. Look
for counterexamples to challenge your claims, either locally to
improve your explanation or globally to replace your entire mental
model. 

 APPLE'S DEVICES ARE LASTING LONGER, MAKING AI STRATEGY EVEN MORE
CRITICAL (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Apple is focusing on extending device longevity and using AI and
software innovations like Apple Intelligence to drive customer
upgrades and new revenue streams amidst slower hardware innovation.
This strategy aims to shift the company's growth focus from hardware
sales alone to more sustainable software-driven services (which also
have the benefit of being subscription-based).
