ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BE CAREFUL WITH USESYNCEXTERNALSTORE (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This developer initially created a `useLocalStorage` hook using
`useSyncExternalStore` to manage local storage, but encountered an
infinite render loop when storing non-string values due to React's
comparison of objects. To resolve this, the hook was edited to
serialize and deserialize data using `superjson`, which handles
non-primitive types more effectively than `JSON.stringify` and
`JSON.parse`. 

 WHAT ARE REACT PORTALS? (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 React Portals offer a way to render a component's children outside
its parent's DOM hierarchy. This is useful for elements like modals
and notifications that need to be displayed at the top level of an
application. 

 5 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REACT SERVER COMPONENTS AND SERVER-SIDE
RENDERING (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Server Components reduce client-side JavaScript by rendering static
parts on the server, skipping hydration, and avoiding bundle bloat.
SSR pre-renders HTML on the server, but still sends the full app
bundle to the client for hydration, increasing load times. While SSR
supports interactive components throughout, Server Components isolate
static and interactive parts.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO COPE WITH TECHNOLOGY FOMO (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Many developers feel anxiety about keeping up with the constant churn
of new technologies. However, chasing the latest trends is not as
important as understanding foundational "keyframe" technologies and
the problems they solve. This lets developers pick up new things
quickly whenever they need to. 

 HOW WE CHOOSE TECHNOLOGIES (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 PostHog prioritizes adopting new technologies when facing urgent
problems like excessive costs or scaling challenges. Decisions are
made asynchronously through a request for comments (RFC) process and
the team continuously evaluates their technology stack to make sure it
aligns with their long-term goals.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 USE EXPO DOM COMPONENTS TO MAGICALLY RUN YOUR WEBSITE AS-IS IN A
NATIVE APP (SPONSOR) [9] 

 If you want to convert your React website to a native app [9], you
end up having to mostly start over because you're missing DOM
elements, CSS, and browser APIs. But what if you could just run your
website as-is in your native app and incrementally migrate it to truly
native views on a component-by-component basis? Find out how [9] 

 OPENNEXT (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 OpenNext is a tool that allows developers to deploy Next.js
applications across various environments, including AWS Lambda and
traditional Node.js servers. It aims to support all Next.js 14
features and is actively maintained by the SST community. 

 INTRODUCING WORKFLOWS: CICD BUILT FOR YOUR APP (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Expo Workflows is a new CI/CD service that allows developers to
automate their entire app development process, from building and
testing to submitting to app stores. It offers pre-packaged jobs for
common tasks and the ability to create custom jobs, triggered by
GitHub events or manually via EAS CLI. 

 LEGEND LIST (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Legend List is an experimental React Native library that aims to be a
higher-performing replacement for FlatList, especially for lists with
dynamically sized items.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW GOOGLE SPENT 15 YEARS CREATING A CULTURE OF CONCEALMENT (14
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google created a culture of concealment to avoid antitrust litigation
by encouraging employees to delete messages, avoid certain words, and
include lawyers in communications. This practice was revealed through
court documents and testimony in three antitrust trials against
Google. 

 AAA - ANALYTICAL ANTI-ALIASING (36 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article explores various anti-aliasing techniques in computer
graphics, starting with simple methods like SSAA and MSAA and
progressing to more advanced techniques. It then goes through
post-processing methods such as MLAA and FXAA. The article's core
focus is on Analytical Anti-Aliasing (AAA), a novel approach that
achieves smooth, sharp results by directly calculating anti-aliased
pixels based on the shape's mathematical definition. 

 STATE OF HTML 2024 (WEBSITE) [15] 

 The State of HTML 2024 report shows that developers are adopting new
HTML features, such as dialog and inert, while being frustrated by
areas of friction like inconsistent browser support. There's a growing
reliance on modern standards for accessibility and interactivity.

QUICK LINKS

 ESSENTIAL TYPESCRIPT FOR REACT (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Some important TypeScript tips for React devs include inferring
output types, typing children with ReactNode, using ComponentProps for
props, and using unions and tuples for better type management. 

 LEOPARDS (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Leopards is a Python library that allows you to query lists of
dictionaries or objects with a SQL-like syntax. 

 SQLITE-VEC NOW SUPPORTS METADATA COLUMNS AND FILTERING (9 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 The latest release of sqlite-vec, a SQLite extension for vector
search, now allows users to store and filter non-vector data like
metadata and auxiliary columns within vector tables, which improves
the efficiency of KNN queries. 

 AUTOTAB (WEBSITE) [19] 

 Autotab is an AI-powered tool that automates repetitive computer
tasks by learning from user demonstrations and executing actions with
mouse and keyboard control.
