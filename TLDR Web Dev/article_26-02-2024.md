ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 GPT IN 500 LINES OF SQL (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article explains how GPT is built and then proceeds to implement
it in SQL. Yes, SQL. ChatGPT itself couldn‚Äôt figure out how to
implement GPT in SQL, but the author builds it step-by-step in about
500 lines. Each part of the implementation is explained, including the
tokenizer, embeddings, and the attention mechanism. 

 JAVASCRIPT BLOAT IN 2024 (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In 2024, JavaScript bundles on modern websites are much bigger than
they need to be, even for simple functionalities. Popular websites,
like ChatGPT and YouTube, have a high amount of client-side JavaScript
bloat that doesn‚Äôt always match the functionality the page offers.
However, certain websites, like adult websites, prioritize fast
loading speeds and have small JavaScript bundles.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW I BUILD AND RUN BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Well-structured behavioral interviews can be highly effective in
evaluating candidates. They should have a clear rubric to evaluate
specific skills and target up to three core skills to understand
deeply. The most important part of a behavioral interview is getting
the candidate to explain situations in detail. The more details, the
harder it is to fabricate a compelling answer. The criteria for
success for an interview should be determined in advance so the
subjectivity of a gut feeling is removed later. 

 IT'S OK TO ABANDON YOUR SIDE-PROJECT (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Many developers feel pressured to constantly ship side projects.
Abandoned projects are common and that‚Äôs okay. The process of
building a side project, even without ultimately shipping a finished
product, still provides a valuable learning experience. 

 SCALING YOURSELF (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Scaling yourself is crucial to multiplying your impact across your
team. The best ways to scale yourself are increasing your influence
through helping others, building tooling that improves the efficiency
of your team, and sharing your knowledge through tech talks, writing,
and code reviews.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 RAYCAST: THE ULTIMATE MAC LAUNCHER TO SUPERCHARGE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY
(SPONSOR) [13] 

 Raycast is a blazingly fast, totally extendable launcher. On top of
searching local apps and files, it lets you complete tasks [13],
calculate, share common links, expand text, manage windows, and much
more. Install extensions [13] for Jira, GitHub, Google Workspace, or
other tools that you use every day, and control them without ever
opening a browser. Download the free version instantly [13] 

 FUNCTIONAL UI KIT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Functional UI Kit is a design system that provides the core
components needed in every project, focusing on accessibility,
development experience, and a unified designer-developer experience.
It makes sure that Figma variables and CSS variables work together
effortlessly by sharing the same names, usage, and inheritance
structure. Each Figma variable has a direct counterpart in CSS. 

 PERSPECTIVE (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Perspective is an interactive analytics and data visualization
component that is well-suited for large and/or streaming datasets. It
can be used to create user-configurable reports, dashboards,
notebooks, and applications. Perspective is deployable stand-alone in
the browser or in concert with Python/Jupyter Notebooks. 

 JUSTPATH (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 A simple utility for exploring the PATH environment variable in both
Windows and Linux.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TROY HUNT: THANKS FEDEX, THIS IS WHY WE KEEP GETTING PHISHED (7
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 FedEx‚Äôs legitimate SMS and email messages contain numerous red
flags typical of scams: typos, strange capitalization, no currency
info, and suspicious domain names for payments. Its payment site
allows users to change tracking numbers and amounts via simple URL
manipulation, making it feel like a phishing site. 

 HOW GOOGLE HELPED DESTROY ADOPTION OF RSS FEEDS (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google, despite initially championing and benefiting from the open
RSS protocol, has systematically undermined it. It has removed RSS
features and has displayed inconsistent support for RSS. The company
has strategically used RSS to gain market share, just to limit it
later. 

 HOW TO NOT DIE BY A THOUSAND CUTS. OR, HOW TO THINK ABOUT SOFTWARE
QUALITY (9 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Traditional approaches to software quality assurance often fail,
leading to a "death by a thousand cuts". Instead, quality should be
everyone‚Äôs job, so each person involved in a product‚Äôs lifecycle
needs to care about a product‚Äôs quality. Understanding the broader
system (company, market, and customers) is essential to building a
high-quality product. Strictly linear design-to-production processes
lead to compounding risk as errors and delays accumulate. Feedback
loops are important to have.

 WHAT APPS HAVE YOU MADE FOR YOUR OWN USE ONLY, THAT YOU USE DAILY?
(REDDIT THREAD) [20] 

 Reddit users have built Discord bots to tell stories to their kids,
scripts to find movie subtitles automatically, simple todo apps, and
more. 

 ASK HN: WHAT DO I DO WITH MY SIDE PROJECTS? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [21]


 Hacker News commenters recommend open-sourcing, using, or attempting
to market side projects that a developer has built but doesn‚Äôt know
what to do with. 

 THE PAST AND PRESENT OF THE SKELETON SCREEN ‚Äî AND HOW TO USE THEM
(6 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Skeleton screens provide a preview of the page layout instead of a
blank page or simple animation, creating a sense of progress and
making wait times feel shorter. Good skeleton screens maintain layout
consistency, use subtle motion effects, and focus on loading larger
structural components rather than small details. 

 PLEASE MAKE YOUR TABLE HEADINGS STICKY (1 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Making table headings sticky to remain visible when scrolling
improves the user experience of navigating large tables.
