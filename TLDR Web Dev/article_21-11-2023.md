ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CSS NESTING (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article discusses the introduction of native CSS nesting in
major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, a feature previously
available only in CSS preprocessors (like Sass). It emphasizes the
ease and benefits of using CSS nesting, providing various examples to
illustrate its utility. Examples include nesting elements without a
class or ID, using CSS combinators, and employing the ampersand symbol
for more complex nesting scenarios. The article also showcases
practical applications of CSS nesting in different contexts, such as
styling post content and card components. 

 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN DATABASES CRASH? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Databases store tables and indexes in files, writing to data pages in
memory, which are then written to disk. A challenge arises when
there's a power loss or crash during writing, leading to corrupted
files. To address this, databases use a Write-Ahead Log (WAL). This
article describes how the WAL is used as a source of truth to help the
database regain its bearings after a crash. 

 DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE CI/CD PIPELINE FOR FRONTEND APPS (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment)
pipeline automates various stages of the software development life
cycle. It typically includes stages like coding, building, testing,
releasing, deploying, monitoring, and planning. This article dives
into best practices for an effective CI/CD pipeline, including making
small, frequent changes, using feature flags, having rollback
strategies, secure deployment strategies, prioritizing security, and
fostering collaboration among all teams.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 CLEVER CODE IS PROBABLY THE WORST CODE YOU COULD WRITE (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Although clever code feels impressive to write, it‚Äôs often
unmaintainable and unreasonable to write in production. Code that is
easy to understand and readable is arguably harder to write than
clever code. This article provides tips and resources, such as an
email about coding style from John Carmack, for getting better at
writing clear code, along with an anecdote about the difficulties of
writing clear code. 

 DATA-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IS A LIE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Data-driven development (DDD) is where logic is expressed through
data structures rather than code. This article describes a typical DDD
scenario in Clojure involving maps and rules for decision-making,
highlighting how initially simple data-driven solutions can become
complex and unwieldy as requirements evolve. The author criticizes the
overselling of DDD in the community and advocates for a more balanced
approach, suggesting that complex checks are often better implemented
directly in Clojure rather than through a data-driven framework.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MAKE REAL STARTER (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Make Real is built with tldraw, a React library for creating
whiteboards and drawings on an infinite canvas. It allows users to
draw a UI mockup and use GPT-4 to turn the image into an HTML file. 

 RIVER (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 River is a robust high-performance job processing system for Go and
Postgres. It enqueues jobs transactionally with other database
changes, resulting in whole classes of distributed systems problems
being avoided. Jobs that are enqueued will be guaranteed only if their
corresponding transaction successfully commits. Conversely, if a
job‚Äôs transaction is rolled back, then that job will be removed.
These jobs remain invisible and unavailable for work until the
transaction is fully committed. 

 REACT JOYRIDE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 React Joyride is a tool that lets you create guided tours of your
React applications. It uses react-floater for styling and positioning
and it gives you the capability to use your own components.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE STATE OF THE DEVELOPER ECOSYSTEM (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This report was created with the feedback and insights of 26,348
developers from around the world. It covers topics like programming
languages, tools, and AI, touching a wide variety of disciplines
including web development. For example, Rust is becoming more popular,
while Scala is one of the highest-paid languages. 

 A SHORT HISTORY OF OPENAI (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sam Altman was removed as CEO of OpenAI on Friday, with exact reasons
unknown. OpenAI, founded in 2015 as a non-profit by Altman and others,
made significant strides in AI research, particularly in deep learning
and reinforcement learning. In 2019, OpenAI transitioned to a
capped-profit model to combine the aspects of for-profit and
non-profit entities, leading to a complex corporate structure. The
recent years saw the release of influential AI models like GPT-3 and
DALL-E and the successful launch of ChatGPT.

QUICK LINKS

 LEARN PERFORMANCE (WEBSITE) [15] 

 A free course by Google on web performance. It covers key web
performance concepts and techniques for improving performance, like
code splitting, lazy loading, and optimizing images, videos, and
fonts. 

 CSS NESTING IS HERE (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 CSS nesting, where one style rule can be nested inside another, is
now native to CSS. 

 BAD STRATEGY, AI MEETINGS, AND TECH DEBT (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article provides thoughts on what bad strategy looks like, AI
tools for meetings, and how tech debt impacts companies at different
stages. Bad strategies are often fluffy, mistaken as goals, and not
focused on specific problems. Tech debt happens at every stage but can
be leveraged better the earlier you are and becomes a drift as you
scale. 

 PRINCIPLES OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING (WEBSITE) [18] 

 Functional programming is a declarative programming style that uses
functions and expressions to create computer programs with the goal of
clear code. Principles of Functional Programming is a free course by
Carnegie Mellon that was taught to computer science students in the
summer of 2023.
