ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PORTING TERRARIA AND CELESTE TO WEBASSEMBLY (22 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Terraria and Celeste were successfully ported to WebAssembly (WASM),
allowing them to run in web browsers. The process involved decompiling
the C# code, configuring it for WASM, and resolving compatibility
issues with the FNA engine, audio libraries, and threading. To load
mods, they made the game binary load at runtime instead of compiling
it with the project and used the Everest mod loader. 

 SLOW QUERY DEBUGGING WHAT BROKE OUR SAAS APP (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A slow database query calculating user credit balances took down
Placid.app when high-volume API requests triggered thousands of
concurrent executions of an expensive query that should have been
cached. Multiple workers tried to calculate the same user's balance
simultaneously and the load ballooned. This caused a cascade of
failures, timeouts, and blocked queries that eventually froze the
system. 

 THE BEAUTY OF TANSTACK ROUTER (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TanStack Router is a great routing solution for React apps due to its
focus type safety and developer experience. The router has features
like type-safe routing parameters, validated search params, and
fine-grained subscriptions to prevent unnecessary re-renders. It
supports both code-based and file-based routing and has integrated
support for React Suspense.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HTAP IS DEAD (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Database architectures have evolved from the unified systems of the
1970s to the specialized OLTP and OLAP systems that emerged due to
conflicting workload demands. HTAP (Hybrid Transactional/Analytical
Processing) became popular in the 2010s to bridge the gap between
transactional and analytical systems. However, HTAP as a single
database failed to gain widespread adoption due to the dominance of
cloud data warehouses, faster hardware negating the need for
distributed OLTP and organizational silos. 

 AS A DEVELOPER, MY MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS ARE A PEN AND A NOTEBOOK (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A pen and notebook are better for problem-solving and creative
thinking than a computer. Stepping away from the computer allows for
more thoughtful design, bug fixing, and understanding of code flow.
Writing and sketching turn abstract ideas into tangible artifacts,
revealing gaps in knowledge.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LEARN HOW TO QUICKLY MONETIZE YOUR SAAS WITH SUBSCRIPTIONS POWERED BY
CLERK BILLING (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Subscription plans boost SaaS revenue but are hard to build from
scratch. Clerk Billing simplifies it—offering a polished UI and
built-in tools to manage plans and gate premium features without
custom logic. This article [10] shows how Clerk Billing works and how
to implement it in your app. 

 ZUSTAND EXPO DEVTOOLS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Zustand Expo DevTools is a DevTools plugin that integrates Zustand
state debugging into the Expo DevTools environment. It has real-time
state inspection, action tracking, and time-travel debugging for
Zustand stores within Expo projects. 

 FIREDBG (WEBSITE) [12] 

 FireDBG is a time travel visual debugger for Rust programs. It has a
VS Code extension. 

 DEFUDDLE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Defuddle is a JavaScript library that extracts the main content from
web pages by removing clutter, standardizing HTML, and providing a
clean output suitable for HTML-to-Markdown conversion.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW CODE REVIEWS ARE CHANGING WITH AI (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 While AI coding tools get most attention, AI code reviews are having
more immediate impact by automating routine checks like coding
conventions and test coverage. AI will become better at reviewing
existing code before mastering autonomous creation of complex systems.
The key shift is moving from "approve first" to "possibly revert
later" workflows. 

 GO CRYPTOGRAPHY SECURITY AUDIT (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The core Go team contracted an external security firm to audit Go's
core cryptography packages, resulting in only one low-severity
finding. The results validate Go's strong cryptographic security
practices and the team also explains other security enhancements
coming to Go. 

 LLM CODEGEN GO BRRR – PARALLELIZATION WITH GIT WORKTREES AND TMUX
(7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI coding agents can be parallelized using Git worktrees to improve
throughput and control over a codebase. uzi is a CLI tool designed to
automate the orchestration of multiple AI agent worktrees. It makes
tasks like prompting, executing commands, and managing agents easier.

QUICK LINKS

 A THOUGHT ON JAVASCRIPT "PROOF OF WORK" ANTI-SCRAPER SYSTEMS (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 JavaScript-based "proof of work" systems, used to deter LLM scrapers,
pose a dilemma because while scrapers could dedicate CPU time to solve
these challenges, doing so exposes them to potential exploitation by
malicious actors injecting other JavaScript for purposes like
cryptocurrency mining or CPU resource draining. 

 OSV (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 OSV is a high-performance CSV parser for Ruby supporting both
hash-based and array-based row formats with various configuration
options. 

 BEWARE OF FAST-MATH (14 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Using "fast-math" compiler flags can speed up math computations at
the cost of accuracy and potentially introduce subtle and
hard-to-debug errors by violating IEEE 754 floating-point standards. 

 TEACHABLE MACHINE (WEBSITE) [20] 

 Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that allows anyone to quickly
and easily create machine learning models to recognize images, sounds,
and poses in a no-code way.
