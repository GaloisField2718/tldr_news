ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 STORING TIMES FOR HUMAN EVENTS (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Storing event times on websites is surprisingly complex due to user
errors, international timezone variations, and historical DST changes.
The common practice of storing only UTC time loses important
information about the event creator's original intent, leading to
inaccuracies. The recommended approach is to store both the user's
intended local time and the event's location, allowing for accurate
timezone conversion and easier updates when necessary. 

 HOW REACT COMPILER PERFORMS ON REAL CODE (22 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The React Compiler, a tool aiming to eliminate the need for manual
memoization in React apps, is tested to see if it automatically
optimizes code in real-world scenarios. Through testing on both simple
examples and a real-world application (approximately 15,000 lines of
code) in scenarios of initial load and interaction performance, most
of the improvements are in interaction speed. While React Compiler
offers performance benefits in many situations, it doesn't eliminate
the need for manual optimization in all cases.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DEBUNKING THE MYTH: SSR ISN'T EXPENSIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The common belief that Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is expensive is a
misconception. Its computational overhead is minimal compared to other
aspects of web requests like database queries and authentication. SSR
often reduces cloud costs by consolidating server-side processes,
minimizing repeated requests and their associated overhead, unlike
multiple client-side requests. 

 USING FAKE DEADLINES WITHOUT DRIVING YOUR ENGINEERS CRAZY (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Deadlines are powerful tools to drive focus and prevent scope creep,
but their effectiveness depends on how they're implemented. In a
healthy environment, they inspire creativity and momentum, while poor
applications of them can lead to burnout and frustration.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING GEMINI 2.0: OUR NEW AI MODEL FOR THE AGENTIC ERA (11
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google has launched Gemini 2.0, its most advanced AI model yet.
Designed for the "agentic era" where AI can understand the world and
act on behalf of users, the multimodal model has native image and
audio output, along with native tool use. Google also launched Deep
Research, which lets Gemini create and carry out a research plan to
create lengthy, cited research reports. 

 NEXT.JS 15.1 (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Next.js 15.1 has stable React 19 support in both routing systems and
improved error debugging with enhanced source maps. New stable
features include the `after()` API for post-response tasks and
experimental `forbidden()` and `unauthorized()` APIs for finer-grained
authentication error handling. 

 REACT NATIVE SHEET TRANSITIONS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 React Native Sheet Transitions is a library that provides smooth,
customizable, iOS-style sheet modal transitions with gesture support
for React Native, Expo Go, and web apps. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE REAL-WORLD IMPACT OF SHARED OBJECTS IN EXPO MODULES (8 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Expo's new Shared Objects feature improves the Expo Modules API,
addressing performance issues and enabling more object-oriented API
design. Previously, operations like image manipulation were
inefficient due to repeated disk writes. Shared Objects eliminate this
by linking JavaScript and native objects, allowing data manipulation
without repeated memory copies. 

 FAR FROM RANDOM: THREE MISTAKES FROM DART/FLUTTER'S WEAK PRNG (29
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This report explains three vulnerabilities that stem from a weak
pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in Dart/Flutter. The
vulnerabilities affected the Dart SDK, Proton Wallet, and SelfPrivacy,
allowing attacks ranging from arbitrary file access to the compromise
of user accounts. The weakness arose from a 32-bit truncation of the
PRNG's 64-bit seed, reducing its entropy and making it easily
brute-forceable. 

 NEW DATABASE DETAILS AI RISKS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The AI Risk Repository, developed by MIT researchers, offers a
framework for monitoring and addressing AI risks, including bias, data
breaches, and misuse. It categorizes over 700 risks by cause and
domain.
