ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FULLY IN-BROWSER GRAPH RAG WITH KUZU-WASM (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Kuzu-Wasm and WebLLM can be used to create a fully in-browser
chatbot, as shown by this article, that answers questions over
LinkedIn data using Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG).
This implementation uses WebAssembly's ability to run complex apps
serverlessly within a browser. The architecture involves converting
natural language questions to Cypher queries, retrieving relevant
graph data, and generating natural language answers with an LLM. 

 SERVER ACTIONS WITH TOAST (USEEFFECT) (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This tutorial goes over how to display toast notifications for React
Server Actions using the `useActionState` Hook. It shows how to adjust
the Server Action to return a timestamped response object and then use
React's `useEffect` Hook in a client component to trigger toast
messages based on the action's state, status, and timestamp to prevent
duplicate notifications. It also covers scenarios such as successful
actions, errors, pending states, and how to integrate these with toast
notifications. 

 WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH RACTORS? (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ractors were introduced in Ruby to enable true in-process parallelism
while still maintaining some level of the Global VM Lock (GVL).
However, due to limitations like restricted shared state, lack of
essential concurrent data structures, and critical implementation
issues, they are impractical for running full web applications.
Despite this, Ractors could still be useful for parallelizing
background tasks in libraries.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I QUIT MY FAANG JOB BECAUSE IT'LL BE AUTOMATED BY THE END OF 2025 (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Jasper Gilley was a former machine learning engineer at a FAANG
company who quit his job because he believes advancements in AI coding
agents will make his position obsolete by the end of 2025. AI's
increasing ability to automate tasks like debugging and context
gathering will diminish the demand for human engineers. The future of
engineering roles will shift towards infrastructure management and AI
agent supervision. 

 SOFTWARE FALSEHOODS: YOU CAN BUILD IT CHEAP, FAST, AND GOOD - PICK
TWO (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 "Cheap, fast, good - pick two" fails in software development because
price is not correlated to either quality or speed. Overpaying for
developers or services doesn't guarantee better outcomes, and hiring
more people can actually slow down development due to increased
communication overhead. True software quality involves understanding
user needs, measuring key metrics, and organizational fit. 

 THE DATA SHOULD JUST FLOW (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 React memoization techniques, like `useMemo` and `useEffect`, can
lead to stale data if dependencies are incorrectly specified, creating
a "clog" in the data flow. This is because of closures in JavaScript,
where outdated values are captured if dependencies are omitted. The
React compiler hopes to solve this by automatically handling
dependencies.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WHY AND HOW TO MAKE SECURITY KNOWLEDGE ASSESSMENTS PART OF YOUR
ROUTINE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Developers — not tools — are the first line of defense in
securing applications. But most organizations don't know where gaps
exist and how to build effective training programs. The solution?
Instilling a culture of developer security knowledge assessments. Read
the blog by Security Journey [11] to learn more, or try a free
assessment here [12]. 

 KIBO UI (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Kibo UI is an open-source library of composable, accessible
components built on shadcn/ui. It's a set of building blocks that wrap
logic from various headless libraries. 

 CODETRACER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 CodeTracer is an open-source, time-traveling debugger. It records
program execution into a shareable trace file, allowing devs to step
forward and backward in time to examine memory history via a GUI.
CodeTracer has features like omniscience, tracepoints, call trace,
state and history explorer, event log, and a CLI for creating and
replaying traces. 

 EVOLVING AGENTS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 The Evolving Agents Framework makes the creation, management, and
evolution of AI agents easier. It features intelligent agent
evolution, semantic search, YAML workflows, multi-framework support,
and governance through firmware. The framework supports the Agent
Communication Protocol and includes a comprehensive example showcasing
agent collaboration, evolution, and semantic search.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PERFORMANCE OF THE PYTHON 3.14 TAIL-CALL INTERPRETER (18 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Within the performance improvements of the Python 3.14 tail-call
interpreter, a significant portion of the gains were due to a
regression in LLVM 19 that inadvertently optimized the previous
interpreter implementation. While the tail-call interpreter still
offers a modest speedup, these gains show the challenges in
benchmarking properly and how software dependencies are tough to deal
with. 

 THE TRAP OF THE TOP-DOWN APPROACH (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Security consultants often need to quickly understand codebases
without extensive coding, but playing with the code is helpful for
deeper understanding. A top-down approach to code auditing is flawed
because it's a time sink with diminishing returns. Instead, a
bottom-up approach is recommended, where focusing on mastering small,
self-contained parts of the codebase leads to a more comprehensive
understanding and bug discovery. 

 JAVASCRIPT (26 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 There is an increasing reliance on JavaScript in web dev and its
impact on performance. Key findings include a rise in JavaScript
volume and requests, alongside the growing use of optimization
techniques like Brotli compression and dynamic imports. However,
challenges remain with mobile performance, legacy code, and
third-party scripts, highlighting the need for developers to
prioritize efficiency and user experience.

QUICK LINKS

 PEOPLE ARE JUST AS BAD AS MY LLMS (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Both large language models and humans have biases in pairwise
comparison ranking tasks, with LLMs showing preference for the first
item presented and humans showing preference for the item on the
right. 

 STACK TRACES ARE UNDERRATED (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Stack traces are necessary for debugging, and their absence or
inconsistency in modern programming languages and distributed
architectures makes debugging tougher. 

 WITH AI YOU NEED TO THINK MUCH BIGGER! (4 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Advancements in AI and better tools have simplified complex tasks, so
devs can now tackle much bigger and more ambitious projects. 

 HOW TO USE AI TO INCREASE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTIVITY (14
MINUTE READ) [22] 

 AI tools should be used for code generation, testing automation,
improved code reviews, documentation, and sometimes full product
rebuilds.
