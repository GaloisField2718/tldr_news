ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE BUILT IT: SMART RETRIES (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Stripe developed a ‚Äúsmart retries‚Äù tool that uses ML to determine
the best time to retry failed payments. The tool helped some
businesses recover over $100 million in revenue. This article goes
into detail on how the tool was implemented and provides 4 key lessons
on building and choosing the right ML model and giving customers
control over how often payments are retried. 

 LESSONS LEARNED UPGRADING TO REACT 18 (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The team at SonarQube recently upgraded from React 17 to 18. In this
article, they share the three biggest issues and lessons they learned
during the process. TypeScript needs to be updated with React. There
is a set of codemods released by the React Core team that helps to
automatically update types, but they come with a couple of issues.
React 18 enables automatic batching by default which can boost
performance, but it can also break UI tests and uncover other
underlying issues. 

 FIXING CUMULATIVE LAYOUT SHIFT PROBLEMS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) measures how much a page shifts while
it is being loaded. It can negatively impact both search rankings and
user perception of site speed. Images are a common cause of CLS
problems. To improve CLS, web developers can give the browser hints of
what size images will be by giving images a width and height attribute
separate from the CSS width and height attributes that are part of the
style tag.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY I DON'T USE SCRUM TO MANAGE MY REMOTE TEAMS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scrum is often used as a process to manage teams, especially remote
teams. However, it can add 8 hours of meetings per sprint, which is
equal to 2 full days of productivity per month. Many projects can‚Äôt
be easily forced into a 2-week sprint process. Using a collaborative
document for each project that addresses the key questions is more
efficient. Meetings can be held to address denser tradeoff decisions
as long interactions over async communication can create long lead
times. 

 ACCURATE ENG ESTIMATIONS: PREDICTING AND NEGOTIATING THE FUTURE (11
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Estimating project timelines in software is hard. Initial estimates
are commonly disrupted by external pressures to deliver faster.
Estimates are also pressured by cross-functional teams, upper
management, and ego-driven desires for faster delivery. To deal with
these pressures, it‚Äôs helpful to focus on project scope, use
productivity metrics, and address optimism bias and black swan events.

your app to a crawl. In this workshop, Sentry [10] engineer Tony Xiao
will demo the latest feature he built for Sentry Performance ‚Äì
automatic regression detection for API endpoints [10]. See how to
trace end-to-end requests, identify root causes, and nip endpoint
regressions in the bud. Sign up early to join the live Q&A [10] 

 ZED (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Zed is a high-performance multiplayer code editor from the creators
of the code editor Atom.

data going to a server. 

 REACT EMAIL 2 (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Resend‚Äôs React Email 2 includes features such as a new preview
experience, significant performance improvements, new components for
displaying code, and the ability to deploy to Vercel. The preview
experience has been revamped with new mobile previews, a revamped file

MISCELLANEOUS

 FROM SEVEN FAILURES TO 10X GROWTH (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Jam, a bug reporting tool, achieved remarkable growth in 2023, going
from zero to one million Jams created. It took 18 months and seven
failed launches before it achieved product-market fit. To reach this
milestone, Jam used internal testing extensively, focused on quality,
had a small group of focused pilot users, and tracked retention. 

 ON OWNING SOFTWARE (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Just like a house needs maintenance, so does software. Software
requires ongoing maintenance and support, which varies depending on
the model of software (open-source, on-prem, or SaaS). SaaS changed
the landscape by offering fixed "rent" costs and reducing the need for
in-house support. The ‚Äúone-off‚Äù software model is unsustainable in
the long term and it often leads to worse support, buggy software, and
a shoddy product.
