ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 EXPLORING THE CHALLENGES IN CREATING AN ACCESSIBLE SORTABLE LIST
(DRAG-AND-DROP) (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Creating an accessible drag-and-drop list is challenging due to
conflicts with screen reader navigation and the need for clear
movement announcements. Overriding default key bindings and using
separate elements for keyboard and mouse interactions can help resolve
these conflicts. Adding a debounce to announcements and providing a
move dialog for voice control users also improves the overall
accessibility and user experience. 

 DEACTIVATING AN API, ONE STEP AT A TIME (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 To safely deactivate an API, first limit new consumers, then discover
existing ones and communicate the upcoming change. Next, deprecate the
API with a clear deadline and communicate a sunset date for final
usage. Finally, block all requests and deactivate the API while making
sure critical bug fixes are addressed during the process. 

 COMPILE-TIME JSON DESERIALIZATION IN C++ (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 C++ doesn't directly support pattern matching like some languages,
but template specialization can achieve similar results. This enables
type-safe JSON deserialization at compile time. By employing constexpr
functions and a lazy parsing approach, the deserialization process can
occur at compile time, allowing for compile-time assertions on JSON
data.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DON'T USE BOOLEANS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Enums offer several advantages over booleans, such as improved
readability, explicit typing for better error handling, and easier
behavior-driven development with extendability for future features.
The overhead of enums is minor compared to the benefits. 

 COMMON ANTI-PATTERNS IN GO WEB APPLICATIONS (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Building user-facing applications can be boring compared to low-level
programming, but the challenge of avoiding unmaintainable code makes
it rewarding. Loose coupling is key to maintainable applications, and
over-reliance on DRY can lead to strong coupling and complexity. Use
separate models for different responsibilities and clear code
generation to improve maintainability and clarity.
