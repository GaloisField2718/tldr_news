ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY GITHUB ACTUALLY WON (22 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Scott Chacon, co-founder of GitHub, explains why GitHub became the
dominant code hosting platform. He attributes it to two key factors:
timing and taste. GitHub launched at a time when distributed version
control systems like Git were gaining traction, filling a void in the
market for hosting these projects. GitHub's founders, being developers
themselves, focused on creating a developer-centric platform with a
user-friendly interface and workflow, unlike other hosting services
that prioritized revenue and distribution. 

 HACKING MISCONFIGURED AWS S3 BUCKETS: A COMPLETE GUIDE (10 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Misconfigured AWS S3 buckets can be hacked through various means,
such as examining HTTP responses, using search engines, and
bruteforcing common keywords. Developers can test for
misconfigurations by testing for list, read, write, and download
permissions, examining Access Control Lists (ACLs), and checking for
missing file type restrictions and S3 versioning. Knowing how to do
this is important to actually secure your S3 buckets properly against
unknown attackers. 

 B-TREES AND DATABASE INDEXES (25 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Many databases rely on B-trees to perform efficient data lookups via
indexes. For example, a sequential integer key outperforms UUIDs in
terms of performance for insert, read, and search operations. This
article explains how B-trees are implemented in databases, then goes
over choosing efficient primary keys and optimizing database
performance.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MAKING HARD THINGS EASY (32 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sometimes, seemingly basic concepts can be challenging to grasp.
Technical difficulties often arise from hidden complexities, like the
massive codebase of a web browser or the intricate distributed nature
of DNS. Understanding the basics of things like computer processes
helps, but so does the sharing of tools, references, and personal
experiences by others. 

 DESIGN PATTERNS ARE TEMPORARY, LANGUAGE FEATURES ARE FOREVER (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A visitor pattern is a design pattern that separates the algorithm
from the object structure. This separation allows new operations to be
added to existing object structures without modifying the structures.
The visitor pattern has become largely obsolete with the advent of
pattern matching features in modern Java, as these features offer a
more concise and readable approach to handling data structures. 

 EVERY WEBPAGE DESERVES TO BE A PLACE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A blogger focused on archive work implemented a feature called
"cursor party" on his website. This feature allows visitors to see
each other's cursors, chat through a hidden feature, and even
highlight text in real-time. These features created a sense of
"co-presence" and made the web feel more like a shared space, which
the author believes the Internet needs more of.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ARE SAAS FORM BUILDERS PUTTING YOUR DATA AT RISK? (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Using 3rd party SaaS for your forms means entrusting sensitive user
data to others. Choose SurveyJS for a secure form management platform
[11] that you can set up directly in your application and keep full
control of where your data travels. Make it your own with the built-in
CSS theme editor! Try the free demo, no sign-up needed [12] 

 ANNOUNCING TYPESCRIPT 5.6 (26 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 TypeScript 5.6 introduces stricter type checking for nullish and
truthy checks, new helper methods for iterators, and support for
arbitrary module identifiers. It also improves the TypeScript language
server by adding region-prioritized diagnostics and granular commit
characters and excluding patterns for auto-imports. 

 SQLC (WEBSITE) [14] 

 Sqlc is a command line tool that generates type-safe code from SQL.
It removes the need for writing boilerplate SQL querying code and
verifies schema changes to prevent production database failures. 

 FAST GRID (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Fast Grid is a multithreaded web table capable of displaying millions
of rows at O(1) speed while maintaining 120fps performance even during
sorting, filtering, and scrolling.

 OOPS, I ACCIDENTALLY MADE OUR WEBSITE FASTER BY SWITCHING TO REMIX (7
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Echobind migrated its website from Next.js hosted on Vercel to Remix
hosted on Railway. The migration proved surprisingly easy, with most
pages needing only minor code adjustments to work with Remix's
structure. Unexpectedly, the switch resulted in significant
performance improvements, with Lighthouse scores increasing and SEO
health scores showing gains. 

 WINDOWS NT VS. UNIX: A DESIGN COMPARISON (25 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Windows NT had features like portability, multiprocessing support,
and compatibility, which were later added to Unix systems. NT's
object-oriented kernel, unified memory architecture, and asynchronous
I/O system show how it had advanced design for its time. 

 A NEW GIANT SOFTWARE MARKET: THE RISE OF SOFTWARE DEFINED VEHICLES
AND THE END OF CAR OWNERSHIP (18 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Cars are turning into complex software platforms, with manufacturers
starting to introduce advanced features and driver assistance systems.
However, this comes with downsides like unclear software update
cycles, limited bug reporting options, and unpredictable software
behavior. The industry is also moving towards subscription models for
car features.

 OUR RNG GIT HASH BUG (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A bug in the Dragon Prince: Xadia game caused clients to believe they

which happened to be a valid scientific notation, as a very large
number instead of a string. 

 HONOX (GITHUB REPO) [20] 

 HonoX is a meta-framework for creating full-stack websites and Web
