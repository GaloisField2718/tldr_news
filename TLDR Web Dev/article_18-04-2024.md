 HARDEST PROBLEM IN COMPUTER SCIENCE: CENTERING THINGS (8 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Centering UI elements is surprisingly hard due to factors like font
metrics (which can be inconsistent), line height complexities, and the
difficulty of aligning text with icons. This article shows multiple
examples of non-centered text on websites from companies like Apple,
Slack, Microsoft, GitHub, and Google. Some tips to align elements
properly: stop using fonts for icons, understand your font metrics,
and pay more attention to alignment in the first place. 

 SCALING MYSQL AT SHOPIFY THROUGH TRANSITIONING TO VITESS FOR ENHANCED
PERFORMANCE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Shopify uses Vitess, a tool that helps distribute database data
across multiple servers, to better handle large amounts of data. To
integrate Vitess into its stack, it created logical data groupings
called keyspaces and implemented features like connection pooling and
transaction management to support the Shop app's growth.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BASIC THINGS (17 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Projects benefit from investing upfront in foundational elements like
READMEs, developer docs, websites, and clear process documentation.
Code quality should always be upheld on the main branch. These kinds
of elements are a productivity multiplier when a project gets larger
and are much harder to introduce into a large project that doesn't
already have them. 

 THE STRUGGLES OF A YOUNG DEVELOPER (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Young developers often focus too much on premature optimization,
which leads to over-engineering things too early. It's better instead
to focus on writing clear, concise, and testable code. This author
tells a story where they wrote over-engineered code as a young
developer, but when it came time to debug it months later, they could
no longer understand the code they had written. 

 THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING: FIGHTING DISTRACTIONS AS A SOFTWARE
DEVELOPER (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 One of the best ways to fight distractions is to have planned
productive hours and get into a ‚Äúflow state.‚Äù To be productive and
focused while coding, it's useful to prioritize tasks ahead of time
and code with good habits.

READ) [11] 

 Devin AI has been promoted with claims that it can perform software
engineering tasks by itself. However, it has been revealed that the

 HEALTHY DOCUMENTATION (16 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 To build a documentation-first culture, CTOs and engineering leaders

documentation as a key part of the company's values. Documentation
saves time for everyone since it leads to less meetings, chat pings,
and knowledge loss.
