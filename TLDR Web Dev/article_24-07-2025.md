ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PARSING PROTOBUF LIKE NEVER BEFORE (43 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Hyperpb is a new high-performance Protobuf library written in Go. It
brings optimizations from UPB to Go, outperforming competing parsers
in benchmarks due to its runtime-dynamic nature and online PGO
capabilities. This article goes over the internal architecture and key
optimizations of hyperpb, including zerocopy strings, repeated
preloads, map optimizations, and arena reuse. 

 WE MIGRATED OUR SITE TO ELEVENTY AND INCREASED PERFORMANCE BY 24% (7
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A company migrated its website from Next.js to Eleventy and achieved
a 24% performance improvement, with its Lighthouse performance score
jumping from 76 to 97. The migration reduced JavaScript bloat from
2,161KB to just 11.3KB and cut NPM dependencies from 1,115 to only 13.


 REACT NATIVE IMAGE LIST: RECREATING APPLE & GOOGLE PHOTOS IN REACT
NATIVE — PART 1 (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There are two main steps when building a high-performance photo
gallery app in React Native, similar to Apple Photos and Google
Photos. The first is efficiently loading photos from the device using
batching and caching techniques (especially important on Android,
where loading 2,100 photos can take 9-16 seconds). The second is
optimizing image rendering by switching from React Native's default
Image component to Expo Image.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 STOP BUILDING AI TOOLS BACKWARDS (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Current AI tools are being built backwards, de-skilling humans by
replacing rather than augmenting their learning processes. AI tools
should reinforce human learning instead by being collaborative tools. 

 LEAVING NEXT.JS BEHIND (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This dev moved their personal website away from Next.js and Vercel
due to a desire for simplicity, greater control, and less reliance on
JavaScript. The new website is built with Hono and self-hosted on a
VPS, statically generated with JSX components, and styled with CSS. 

 CODE REVIEW IN THE AI AGE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI is changing the way code review happens by generating large
volumes of code quickly, creating new challenges for developers who
must now review machine-generated commits at a more senior level,
regardless of their experience. While AI can produce functional code
fast, it often creates oversized, complex changesets that overwhelm
traditional review processes and lead to more bugs getting into code
bases.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NODE.JS LOGGING WITH PINO: SHAPE, ROUTE, AND CENTRALIZE YOUR LOGS
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 This tutorial covers step-by-step instructions + JS code samples to
build a production-grade logging system in Node.js and CENTRALIZE YOUR
LOGS WITH DASH0 [11]. Learn to install and configure Pino, capture
event and error details, shape your logs with serializers, redact
sensitive data, and integrate with Fastify and Express. BOOKMARK THE
TUTORIAL [10] 

 REANIMATED 4 STABLE RELEASE — THE FUTURE OF REACT NATIVE ANIMATIONS
(5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Reanimated 4 is a big update to the main React Native animation
library. The release introduces a CSS-compatible animation API for
simpler, state-controlled animations, alongside performance
improvements for existing worklets. Worklets are essential for complex
animations and have been moved to a separate package for independent
progress. 

 TABBY (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Tabby is a customizable, cross-platform terminal app for various
connection types, including local shells, SSH, and serial. It has
support for Windows environments, providing a better shell experience
with tab completion and integration. It also has an integrated SSH
client with file transfer capabilities, terminal features like
multiple panes and activity notifications, and customization through
themes and plugins. 

 MCP-UI (WEBSITE) [14] 

 MCP-UI provides SDKs to build interactive user interfaces for MCP
applications, enabling UI integration with AI interactions. The
client-side SDK provides React components and hooks, while server-side
SDKs facilitate UI creation in various formats like HTML, React, and
Web Components using Typescript and Ruby.

 AI CODING AGENTS ARE REMOVING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE BARRIERS (5 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 This dev was a Ruby developer for a decade. They transitioned to
working with C++, C, and Rust in 2025 using AI coding tools like
Cursor and Claude Code. These tools helped overcome the steep learning
curve of system programming, acting as a pairing partner that provided
language-specific expertise and identified existing patterns. AI
complements human expertise by speeding up learning and allowing devs
to focus on problem-solving rather than struggling with syntax and
basic conventions. 

 WHEN IS WEBASSEMBLY GOING TO GET DOM SUPPORT? (21 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 WebAssembly (Wasm) may eventually get direct DOM access, a
requirement for integrating it into web applications. While Wasm was
designed to be separate from JavaScript, it currently relies on
JavaScript "glue code" to interact with web APIs like the DOM. 
Wasm's integration with JavaScript is progressively evolving, focusing
on improving performance and reducing code size, with some added
capabilities for exceptions, blocking operations, and garbage
collection. 

 APPLE'S BROWSER ENGINE BAN PERSISTS, EVEN UNDER THE DMA (8 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Despite the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) requiring Apple to allow
third-party browser engines on iOS, Apple continues to impose barriers
that effectively block competitors like Google and Mozilla from
offering their own browser engines to EU users. The main obstacle is
Apple's requirement that browser vendors create entirely new apps to
use their own engines, forcing them to abandon existing EU users and
start from scratch, which makes the investment commercially unviable.

QUICK LINKS

 OPTIMIZATIONS THAT AREN'T (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Optimization of code should always be done with careful profiling and
testing to make sure it actually improves performance and doesn't
introduce bugs. 

 CHECKLISTS ARE HARD (BUT STILL A GOOD THING) (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 It's hard to create complete checklists for complex sysadmin tasks,
as they have inevitable imperfections due to memory limitations and
the difficulty of testing. 

 INTRODUCING OSS REBUILD: OPEN SOURCE, REBUILT TO LAST (8 MINUTE READ)
[20] 

 Google has announced OSS Rebuild, a new project designed to
strengthen trust in open source package ecosystems by reproducing
upstream artifacts to help security teams detect supply chain attacks.


 REVERSE ENGINEERING GITHUB ACTIONS CACHE TO MAKE IT FAST (9 MINUTE
READ) [21] 

 Blacksmith, a CI cloud platform for GitHub Actions, achieved up to
10x faster cache performance by reverse engineering GitHub Actions
cache and transparently routing requests through their faster,
colocated cache.
