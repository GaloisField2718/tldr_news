ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 MILLIONS OF ACCOUNTS VULNERABLE DUE TO GOOGLE'S OAUTH FLAW (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 A flaw in Google's "Sign in with Google" OAuth allows attackers to
access accounts of former employees at defunct startups by purchasing
the company's domain. This vulnerability affects millions of
Americans, granting access to sensitive data across various SaaS
platforms like Slack, Notion, and HR systems containing social
security numbers. Google is currently working on a fix. 

 HOW RQLITE IS TESTED (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 rqlite is a distributed relational database that uses a testing
strategy based on the testing pyramid. This strategy prioritizes
comprehensive unit testing of individual components, followed by
integration tests focusing on the interaction between Raft consensus
and SQLite. A minimal set of end-to-end tests verify basic
functionality, while performance testing pushes the database to its
limits under heavy load. 

 UNDERSTANDING REACT SERVER COMPONENTS (34 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 React Server Components (RSCs) come with the "double data problem,"
where the same data is sent as both HTML and a "payload" (serialized
React Element tree), potentially increasing bandwidth usage. RSCs use
techniques like streaming and React's `Suspense` to optimize
performance, but careful consideration of component placement (client
vs. server) is necessary to avoid issues.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 REWRITING MY WEBSITE IN PLAIN HTML AND CSS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This developer rewrote their simple website from SvelteKit to plain
HTML and CSS due to frustration with the Javascript bundler and build
process, available free time, and a desire to migrate to Cloudflare
Pages. The rewrite involved using Pandoc to convert Markdown blog
posts to HTML, Python with the `uv` library for scripting, and the
`http.server` module for serving the site. The result was a
significantly smaller website (~88kb vs ~356kb). 

 HOW NOT TO LEARN RUST (16 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This post goes over common mistakes new Rust programmers make. These
mistakes include neglecting dedicated study time, diving into complex
algorithms without sufficient foundational knowledge, and
misinterpreting compiler errors and warnings. Best practices from
other languages don't always apply directly to Rust, especially due to
Rust's unique ownership and borrowing system. 

 MAYBE DON'T NAVIGATE(-1) IN REMIX/REACT ROUTER (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Using `navigate(-1)` in Remix/React Router for creating "Back" links
can be problematic as it accesses the browser's history, potentially
navigating outside the application. A better approach is to use the
`Link` component's `state` property to pass a `back` URL, allowing
controlled navigation within the app.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 PYPER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Pyper is a pure Python framework for concurrent and parallel data
processing that simplifies building data pipelines using a functional
paradigm. It has an intuitive API to unify threaded, multiprocessed,
and asynchronous operations safely. 

 MIRAI (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Mirai is a Server-Driven UI framework for Flutter that allows
developers to build dynamic, cross-platform apps using JSON
configurations. It simplifies UI delivery, allowing for real-time
updates without redeployment, and supports mobile, web, and desktop
platforms. 

 PNPM 10.0 (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 pnpm 10.0 released with improved security by no longer running
lifestyle scripts of dependencies by default, improved hashing, and
other performance & feature improvements.

 WHAT'S INVOLVED IN GETTING A "MODERN" TERMINAL SETUP? (12 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Achieving a "modern" terminal setup can be frustrating. Key aspects
of a modern experience include multiline paste support, infinite shell
history, and 24-bit color. Popular shells like bash and zsh often lack
essential features out-of-the-box. 

 DON'T USE COSINE SIMILARITY CARELESSLY (14 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Using cosine similarity carelessly when comparing vectors generated
from text embeddings can be problematic. While seemingly simple and
widely used, cosine similarity often fails to capture true semantic
similarity, instead focusing on superficial aspects like writing style
or matching questions to questions rather than questions to answers.
More effective approaches include directly querying LLMs for
similarity comparisons, training task-specific embeddings, and
pre-processing text to remove irrelevant information before embedding.


 THE SHIFT IN METRICS: HOW PRODUCT ENGINEERS MEASURE SUCCESS (6 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 Traditional engineering metrics like features shipped or lines of
code focus on outputs, which often fail to capture the true impact of
engineering efforts. Outcome-oriented metrics, such as customer
retention, feature adoption, and revenue growth, better align with
business goals by measuring value delivered.

 SHALLOW CLONES VERSUS STRUCTURED CLONES (5 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 When creating deep copies of nested JavaScript objects, using
`structuredClone` instead of shallow cloning methods like the spread
operator (`...`) prevents unexpected state mutations by verifying that
all nested objects and arrays are duplicated, not just referenced. 

 FFMPEG BY EXAMPLE (WEBSITE) [22] 

 This website provides a collection of examples that demonstrate
various FFmpeg functionalities, like extracting multiple video clips
with one input. 

 EPOCH SEMANTIC VERSIONING (8 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 "Epoch Semantic Versioning” is a new versioning scheme that extends
Semantic Versioning by adding an "Epoch" number to better communicate
the significance of changes, addressing the limitations of zero-major
versioning and the logarithmic human perception of version numbers. 

 A NEW CHAPTER FOR EXPRESS.JS: TRIUMPHS OF 2024 AND AN AMBITIOUS 2025
(8 MINUTE READ) [24] 

 In 2024, Express.js released version 5.0, improved governance,
enhanced security measures, and increased community engagement.
