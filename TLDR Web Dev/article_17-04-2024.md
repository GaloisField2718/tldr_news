ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 TEN YEARS OF IMPROVEMENTS IN POSTGRESQL'S OPTIMIZER (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 PostgreSQL's query optimizer has improved massively over the past
decade. Using the Join Order Benchmark (JOB), this author shows that
tail latency has been nearly halved between PostgreSQL versions 8 and
16, with each major version offering an average 15% performance
increase. One of the best decisions teams can make to make their
database query speeds faster is to simply keep their Postgres
instances up to date. 

 HOW PAYPAL SERVES 350 BILLION DAILY REQUESTS WITH JUNODB (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 JunoDB is a highly reliable database developed by PayPal with an
architecture that supports near-constant availability and efficient
handling of massive data request loads. Its architecture includes a
client library, a proxy with load balancing, and storage servers using
RocksDB. 

 UPGRADING 3 MILLION VARIABLES TO ENVELOPE ENCRYPTION (7 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Railway, a cloud deployment platform, used to rely heavily on Google
Cloud's Key Management Service (KMS) for encrypting sensitive user
configuration variables. To improve performance, security, and reduce
dependency on a single provider, Railway implemented envelope
encryption, which encrypts data with a data encryption key that is
itself encrypted with a key encryption key. This change reduced KMS
usage and allows Railway to have potentially no dependencies on
external cloud infrastructure in the future.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FASTER CONNECTIVITY !== FASTER WEBSITES (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Despite the increase in internet speeds, the user experience on many
websites has not proportionally improved due to bloated websites and
performance issues. Websites designed to load static content all at
once remain the most accessible universally and often outperform all
other websites. Modern websites that prioritize complex features over
basic usability like scrolling and search are often slower than
average. 

 BUILDING SOMETHING REAL IN YOUR SPARE TIME (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To bring a side project to completion, start by defining specific
goals, then break the project into smaller milestones to maintain
motivation. Work on it consistently but sustainably by prioritizing
features properly. 

 MENTAL HEALTH IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article shares a tech co-founder's struggle with anxiety and
burnout, which stemmed from the intense work environment in the
startup world. Neglecting mental health can take a heavy toll. To
manage his anxiety better, the author set boundaries and prioritized
self-care.

 MIKROORM 6.2 (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 MikroORM is a TypeScript data-mapper ORM. Recently released MikroORM
v6.2 introduces support for Microsoft SQL Server and libSQL, along
with better handling of collection updates and pagination.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FAILURES, MISTAKES, CONFUSION (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 In programming languages, failures are systemic limitations that come
from constraints and might be recoverable. Mistakes are code-based
errors that violate program logic and usually need safe termination.
Failures and mistakes should be handled differently by software. 

 DISTRIBUTED AUTHORIZATION (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Authorization is complex and creates problems in microservice-based
applications. Existing approaches either mix authorization logic with
application code (making it hard to understand and update) or
centralize authorization data, leading to tough data synchronization.
A new service called Oso Cloud solves these issues with policy-based
logic and a new distributed authorization architecture, allowing
developers to define logic centrally while still using local data to
make authorization decisions. 

 A BLUEPRINT FOR MAKING QUANTUM COMPUTERS EASIER TO PROGRAM (6 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 MIT researchers have identified a major challenge in quantum
programming: the lack of control flow instructions like those in
classical computers. To address this, they proposed a new model called
the quantum control machine which includes modified instructions that
make quantum computers easier to program.

 HOW I SETUP MY TERMINAL FOR MAX PRODUCTIVITY (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A detailed guide to customizing your terminal setup to use
productivity-oriented plugins, themes, aliases, and command-line
utilities. 

 A QUICK POST ON CHEN'S ALGORITHM (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Chen's algorithm is a new quantum algorithm that, if proven correct,
could potentially break lattice-based cryptography schemes, which are
currently used to secure many systems today. 

 OPTIMIZING NODE.JS PERFORMANCE (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 To profile the CPU usage of a Node.js application, launch the
application with the ‚Äò--inspect flag' and connect to it using Chrome
DevTools via ‚Äòchrome://inspect'. Start and stop the CPU profiling
using the Record button in the Performance panel of DevTools to
capture how CPU time is spent during application execution. 

 SITE CLAIMS TO HAVE HARVESTED 4B+ DISCORD CHATS, ALL ON SALE (3
MINUTE READ) [21] 

 A service named Spy.pet has collected over 4 billion Discord messages
from public chat servers and is now selling access to this data.
