ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 OPENPOKE: RECREATING POKE'S ARCHITECTURE (14 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This dev reverse-engineered Poke, a popular iMessage assistant
chatbot, and developed OpenPoke, a working prototype of its
multi-agent architecture. OpenPoke uses an Interaction Agent to manage
specialized Execution Agents that handle tasks like email management
and setting reminders. The system incorporates multi-tiered memory,
including conversation logs, agent logs, and email as external truth.
The assistant separates personality from execution, while recognizing
personality as an important product element. 

 NPM SECURITY BEST PRACTICES (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This is a consolidated list of best practices for securing against
incidents in the NPM ecosystem, covering npm, bun, deno, pnpm, and
yarn. For devs, important best practices include pinning dependency
versions, including lockfiles in repos, disabling lifecycle scripts,
and reducing external dependencies. Maintainers should enable 2FA,
create tokens with limited access, generate provenance statements, and
always review published files. 

 FINE-GRAINED HTTP FILTERING FOR CLAUDE CODE (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 httpjail is a tool designed to mitigate security risks associated
with increasingly powerful coding agents by implementing fine-grained
HTTP(S) filtering. It works by intercepting HTTP requests and applying
user-defined JavaScript or shell script rules to control agent access
to external resources, focusing on preventing destructive actions,
data leaks, and excessive authority. It has both a "weak" mode that
relies on environment variables and a "strong" mode that uses network
namespaces, including TLS interception for HTTPS traffic inspection.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DEAR GITHUB: NO YAML ANCHORS, PLEASE (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This dev isn't a fan of GitHub's recent addition of YAML anchor
support to GitHub Actions. YAML anchors are redundant, complicate
workflow comprehension for both humans and machines, and don't have
any unique utility due to the absence of merge key support in GitHub
Actions. This change makes it harder to analyze workflows for
vulnerabilities, thereby worsening GitHub Actions' security. 

 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CODING AGENTS STOP FEELING LIKE DIALUP? (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Current coding agents' speed and performance is similar to the slow
and unreliable dial-up era of the internet. There are issues with
reliability and a strain on infrastructure due to exploding AI token
usage. However, with time, there will be faster token processing
speeds, which will enable more unsupervised and efficient coding agent
workflows. 

 WHY I'M SPOILED BY APPLE SILICON (BUT STILL LOVE FRAMEWORK) (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The battery life of a MacBook M1 Pro is much better than that of a
Framework 13 laptop. Even after weeks of inactivity, the M1 MacBook
still holds a charge well. In contrast, this author's Framework
laptop, despite running Fedora Silverblue, has a lot of battery drain
in suspend mode.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NATIVE INTEGRATIONS; BUILD VS. BUY GUIDE BY PRISMATIC (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Integrations are part of the project if you're building a B2B app in
2025. However, building them in-house provides the illusion of control
while leading to resource inefficiencies and a mountain of tech debt.
Read [10] what building in-house actually requires, common concerns
with buying an integration platform, and the benefits of an embedded
iPaaS. Get the guide [10] 

 CAP'N WEB: A NEW RPC SYSTEM FOR BROWSERS AND WEB SERVERS (21 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Cap'n Web is a new, open-source RPC system for JavaScript
environments for facilitating communication between applications over
a network. Unlike traditional RPC, Cap'n Web supports bidirectional
calling, object-capability security, and promise pipelining, aiming
for a developer experience similar to native JavaScript APIs. It makes
setup easier, integrates with TypeScript, and uses human-readable JSON
serialization. 

 REACT OLD ICONS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 React Old Icons is a React component library with over 2,300 vintage
icons from classic operating systems and software. It provides an
interactive icon browser with search, filtering, and code copying, and
supports TypeScript.

 COMPILEBENCH: CAN AI COMPILE 22-YEAR-OLD CODE? (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 CompileBench is a new benchmark created to test the ability of LLMs
to handle complex software development tasks like dependency
management and legacy code compilation. The benchmark tested 19 LLMs
on 15 real-world tasks, including cross-compiling and resurrecting old
code, showing varying levels of success and identifying issues like
cheating. Anthropic models performed best in overall success and
speed, while OpenAI models were the most cost-efficient. 

 WHY LOCAL-FIRST APPS HAVEN'T BECOME POPULAR? (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Local-first apps have adoption challenges due to the complexity of
syncing data across devices, especially offline. The key to successful
local-first apps lies in achieving eventual consistency, making sure
all devices converge to the same state without data loss. This happens
through techniques like Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLCs) for reliable
ordering and Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to handle
data conflicts. 

 AI-GENERATED “WORKSLOP” IS DESTROYING PRODUCTIVITY (11 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 "Workslop" is AI-generated content that lacks substance but appears
polished. Due to AI being used more, there's more low-effort AI slop
at work, leading to worse productivity overall, as it shifts the
burden of real effort to the receivers of the AI slop. This "workslop
tax" has financial and interpersonal costs, bringing down trust and
collaboration.

QUICK LINKS

 TESTING IS BETTER THAN DSA (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Instead of excessively focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms,
software engineers should also prioritize learning software testing,
as it's a more practical, valuable, and frequently used skill in
real-world software development. 

 MY NEW GIT UTILITY `WHAT-CHANGED-TWICE` NEEDS A NEW NAME (5 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 A new Perl utility named "what-changed-twice" is designed to identify
files modified in multiple commits within a git log. 

 HOW I, A NON-DEVELOPER, READ THE TUTORIAL YOU, A DEVELOPER, WROTE FOR
ME, A BEGINNER (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This dev goes over her struggle to follow a developer's tutorial
filled with jargon and complex instructions, showing the disconnect
between the expert's knowledge and a beginner's comprehension. 

 QWEN3-OMNI (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Qwen3-Omni is a newly released, multilingual, omni-modal foundation
model by Alibaba Cloud's Qwen team capable of processing and
generating text, images, audio, and video in real time, with
state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
