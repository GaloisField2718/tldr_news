ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DATABASE FUNDAMENTALS (27 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article teaches database fundamentals by guiding the reader in
building a simple database. It starts with the ACID properties
(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) that most
databases aim to guarantee and discusses the challenges in achieving
these properties. It then delves into the concept of storage engines
in databases, comparing mutable B-Trees and immutable Log Structured
Merge (LSM) Trees. It explains how LSM Trees are designed to minimize
disk I/O and seeks, making them suitable for write-heavy workloads.
The article touches on topics like bloom filters and Write-Ahead Logs
(WALs) as part of database design to achieve ACID properties and
isolation. 

 THE AWAIT EVENT HORIZON IN JAVASCRIPT (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 An async function, upon awaiting a Promise, cannot proceed until that
Promise resolves, which could potentially lead to resource leaks if
the Promise never settles. There are many remediations to the problem,
like Explicit Resource Management and AbortSignal. However, in
practice, they are limited and don't solve the fundamental problem.
Instead, generator functions in JavaScript can offer more structured
concurrency as they are not constrained by the await event horizon.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE BEST WEBASSEMBLY RUNTIME MAY BE NO RUNTIME AT ALL (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 An alternative approach to WebAssembly (WASM) runtimes is no runtime
at all. Traditional WASM runtimes like V8, Wasmer, WasmEdge, and
Wasmtime are complex and platform-dependent. Instead, transpile Wasm
code to C source code using tools like wasm2c or w2c2, which results
in human-readable C code that can be compiled and run without the need
for a dedicated runtime. 

 HOW TO PREPARE THE TECHNICAL INTERVIEW (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post shares an experience of preparing for internal interviews
to switch teams at Amazon. It emphasizes the importance of making a
positive impression on interviewers, both emotionally and rationally,
by engaging in meaningful conversations and explaining thought
processes clearly. It goes on to outline a strategic approach to
interview preparation involving mindset, learning modes, a structured
plan, struggle time, and the interview week, highlighting the
importance of consistent effort and focus.

 A library of free-to-use SVG logos. 

 ANNOUNCING REACT HYDRATION OVERLAY - EASILY SQUASH HYDRATION ERRORS
(GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Overlay for debugging hydration mismatches, providing an explicit
diff between the server-side and client-side renders.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW MANY LINES OF C IT TAKES TO EXECUTE A + B IN PYTHON? (10 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 This article delves into the implementation details of how Python
handles operations like "a + b" at the CPython runtime level. It
discusses the use of the PyObject structure and PyTypeObject structure
to enable polymorphism and inheritance in Python objects. The article
explores how dynamic dispatch works in Python, including the
compilation of Python code to bytecode and its execution by the
CPython virtual machine. 

 WHY MULTI-CLOUD: THE 5 BEST REASONS, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS (6 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 A multi-cloud architecture is an approach that involves using
multiple cloud providers for an application or company. There are
several reasons to adopt a multi-cloud approach, including regulatory
compliance, avoiding vendor lock-in, meeting customer requirements,
gaining leverage in price negotiations with cloud providers, and
empowering engineering teams. However, the primary motivation for
adopting multi-cloud should be to address business problems rather
than technical ones.

 PROGRAMS ARE GAMES, PROGRAMMING IS A GAME (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Programming can be considered a unique and fun game where individuals
can create programs to map inputs to outputs, making it more enjoyable
than many other activities. 

 MEASURING THE SIZE OF THE CACHE LINE EMPIRICALLY (3 MINUTE READ) [14]


 The cache line is the block of memory accessed by computers when
reading or writing data. Cache line size varies among systems. This
blog explores a benchmarking method using "strided access" to
determine the cache line size. 

 OXLINT GENERAL AVAILABILITY (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Oxlint is a JavaScript linter designed to catch erroneous or useless
code without requiring any configurations by default. It‚Äôs 50-100
times faster than ESlint and defaults to identifying erroneous,
redundant, or confusing code over unnecessary nitpicking rules.
