ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 IN S3 SIMPLICITY IS TABLE STAKES (20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Amazon's S3 began as a simple object store but has evolved into a
full-fledged data platform with features like strong consistency,
conditional operations, and increased bucket limits, all in response
to builder needs. A key challenge has been balancing simplicity with
velocity. The new S3 Tables shows this evolution, integrating Iceberg
to offer a new table abstraction within S3. 

 GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE OF GIT'S NEW BUNDLE-URI (11 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Git's new `bundle-uri` feature is designed to speed up clones by
using a pre-calculated seed file from a CDN, which is great for
reducing server load on Git forges and internal Git servers.
Initially, using a CDN-hosted bundle didn't improve clone times as
expected. After investigation, it was discovered that Git only copies
local branch references from the bundle, causing it to re-download
many objects. A small code change to copy all references (including
tags and remote references) improved clone times. 

 THE URL IS A GREAT PLACE TO STORE STATE IN REACT (6 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Simply using useState will cause the states to be lost when the web
page is reloaded. There are options to store state like in server side
or in client browser which can be better than storing in URL depending
on your use case. However, URL state storage lets you share states
with different users - reading from URL is generally faster and it
exposes the state as global.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 CAREER ADVICE IN 2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The current job market in 2025 is challenging to navigate. The rise
of LLMs and AI companies is shifting the skills valued by employers,
devaluing experience in team building and rewarding those focused on
technical details and AI integration. Many companies are also
struggling with reduced valuations and funding, leading to less
hiring, promotions, and liquidity, except for highly competitive AI
companies. 

 HOW I'VE RUN MAJOR PROJECTS (21 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This is a playbook for effective project management within complex,
fast-paced environments like Anthropic. Good projects have devs
focusing intensely on the project, maintaining a detailed plan to
track progress, and running a rapid "OODA loop" (observe, orient,
decide, and act) to adapt to new information. Overcommunication is
necessary for everyone to be aware of things, so they can make the
best decisions. 

 I USE CURSOR DAILY - HERE'S HOW I AVOID THE GARBAGE PARTS (6 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 When using Cursor, the AI coding IDE, it's useful to use
`.cursorrules` to guide the AI, providing it with relevant code
context. Composer is best used for simple changes and Chat for more
complex tasks. At the same time, developers should be hyperaware of
the limitations of AI in bug fixing and ensure their coding skills do
not deteriorate over time.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FIND → FIX → TEXT: AN INTRO TO SENTRY AND CODECOV (SPONSOR) [15] 

 Join a 25-minute group demo of Sentry [15], covering agentless setup
and all the important features:

 	* Error monitoring with breadcrumbs and session replay
 	* Tracing to find problematic code responsible for a slowdown
 	* Analyzing code coverage right from your PR

 DOCS (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Docs is an open-source collaborative document editor built with
Django and React. It focuses on simple, real-time collaborative
editing with features like offline support, granular access control,
and various document export formats. It's a joint effort by the French
and German governments. 

 CODEVIDEO STUDIO (WEBSITE) [17] 

 CodeVideo Studio is a way to make educational coding videos quickly.
It allows software educators to write a course once and export it to
various formats like video, blog posts, presentations, and code. 

 RUBYLLM (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 RubyLLM is a Ruby gem that makes working with AI models easy using a
unified API and consistent format. It supports features like chatting,
image/audio/document analysis, image generation, embeddings, and
custom tools. The gem also offers Rails integration for persisting
chats and messages, streaming responses, and easy configuration
through API keys.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LOCAL LLMS ON MOBILE ARE A GIMMICK - FOR NOW (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Current limitations for running LLMs locally on mobile devices
include large model sizes, the need for specific model formats and
inference frameworks, and performance trade-offs between speed and
quality, leading to device heating and battery drain. Frameworks like
MLC try to simplify the process by compiling and optimizing models for
specific devices. While on-device AI is probably a big part of the
future, it's a gimmick in its current state. 

 REPRODUCIBILITY VS PROVENANCE: TRUSTING THE JAVASCRIPT SUPPLY CHAIN
(5 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The JavaScript package ecosystem faces security threats despite
efforts to establish provenance by tracking package origins.
"Reproduce" is a new open-source tool that independently verifies if
an npm package can be rebuilt from its declared source. This tool
fetches source metadata, clones the repository, runs build steps, and
compares the resulting artifact with the published package to ensure
reproducibility. Testing against the top 5,000 "high impact" npm
packages, Reproduce found that only 5.78% of packages were
reproducible.

QUICK LINKS

 BIG LLMS WEIGHTS ARE A PIECE OF HISTORY (2 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 While efforts like the Internet Archive are necessary for preserving
history, the publicly available weights of large language models offer
a valuable, albeit lossy, compressed snapshot of the Internet that
should be actively maintained and preserved as well. 

 OUR INTERFACES HAVE LOST THEIR SENSES (9 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Digital interfaces have become overly simplified and focused on text
and visual input, neglecting the potential for richer, multi-sensory
interactions that better align with how humans naturally engage with
the world. 

 WHO IS FREE SOFTWARE FOR? (11 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Despite the successes of the Open Source and Free Software movements
in creating valuable resources, they haven't achieved widespread
adoption or shifted power away from tech giants because they primarily
cater to "hackers" and fail to address the actual needs and realities
of the broader public. 

 AIOPANDAS (GITHUB REPO) [24] 

 Aiopandas is a Python library that adds async functionality for
operations like `map`, `apply`, and `transform` in Pandas.
