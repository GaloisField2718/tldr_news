ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW LYFT USES ML TO MAKE 100 MILLION PREDICTIONS A DAY (15 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Lyft processes 100 million ML predictions daily through LyftLearn
Serving, a platform that replaced a problematic monolithic service
with isolated microservices where each team owns their own model
serving infrastructure. The system handles real-time predictions for
ride pricing, fraud detection, and ETAs using a Flask/Gunicorn HTTP
layer with custom predict/load functions that support any ML
framework. 

 HOW TO DESIGN APIS FOR AN AI WORLD (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 API design must evolve for AI consumers, which combine machine
precision with human-like understanding and create new constraints
like token economics, high latency, and non-deterministic behavior.
This means new APIs should be designed for self-healing through rich
error messages, treating documentation as runtime code since AI
references it continuously, and optimizing for batching and streaming
to handle AI's multi-second processing times.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ON HOW LONG IT TAKES TO KNOW IF A JOB IS RIGHT FOR YOU OR NOT (9
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 You usually know within the first week if a job is a good fit.
Alignment for managers is especially important, as their role requires
them to represent and believe in the company's values. 

 HOW I PROGRAM WITH AGENTS (23 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Unlike agentless LLMs that act like a virtual whiteboard, agents can
use tools like bash, patch, and web search to navigate codebases, fix
errors using compiler feedback, and improve API usage. While agents
are great for handling larger codebases and automating tasks, they
also have downsides like increased time and token consumption. Also,
containers should be used to solve agent safety issues and allow for
the parallel running of agents. 

 FINE-TUNING LLMS IS A HUGE WASTE OF TIME (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Fine-tuning advanced LLMs for knowledge injection is a waste of time
and potentially destructive. Updating neurons in these models can
overwrite existing valuable knowledge, leading to unintended
consequences.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SYNC CLERK USER DATA TO SUPABASE IN REAL TIME WITH WEBHOOKS (SPONSOR)
[9] 

 STOP POLLING AND START SYNCING. THIS GUIDE SHOWS HOW TO STREAM CLERK
USER UPDATES INTO SUPABASE WITH EASE. LEARN HOW [10]. 

 LINGO.DEV (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Lingo.dev is an open-source, AI-powered i18n toolkit designed for
instant localization using LLMs. It offers a compiler for build-time
React localization, a CLI for translating various content formats,
CI/CD for automated translation workflows, and an SDK for real-time,
per-request translation of dynamic content. 

 ROWBOAT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Rowboat is an AI-powered platform that lets users quickly build
multi-agent workflows using tools, integrate them into applications
via HTTP API or Python SDK, and use features like RAG and custom LLM
providers.

MISCELLANEOUS

 YES, YOU CAN USE AI IN OUR INTERVIEWS. IN FACT, WE INSIST (5 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Canva now expects engineering candidates to use AI tools during
technical interviews, replacing traditional coding questions that AI
can solve easily with complex, ambiguous problems. It evaluates how
well candidates collaborate with AI strategically by breaking down
requirements, critically reviewing generated code, and making sound
technical decisions. 

 YES, SENTRY HAS AN MCP SERVER (...AND IT'S PRETTY GOOD) (10 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Sentry offers an MCP server, allowing LLMs to access valuable context
about application issues directly from Sentry. The Sentry MCP has
features like remote hosting, OAuth authentication, streamable HTTP,
and various tool calls for accessing project information and issues,
and even using Sentry's AI agent Seer. This lets LLMs provide more
informed and accurate responses by using real-time Sentry data. 

 DID ANTHROPIC MAKE A BILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE BY CUTTING OFF WINDSURF
FROM CLAUDE? (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic recently cut off AI IDE Windsurf's access to its Claude
models, betting that developers would follow the most capable models
and move to Cursor. Anthropic did this as a move against its chief
rival OpenAI, which is set to acquire Windsurf in a $3B deal.

QUICK LINKS

 TANSTACK FORM VS. REACT HOOK FORM (18 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 React Hook Form is better for simpler forms and projects where
stability is a priority, while TanStack Form is better for complex
forms and large-scale applications. 

 THE FIRST BIG AI DISASTER IS YET TO HAPPEN (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The first major disaster caused by AI language models is likely
imminent, potentially involving AI agents automating harmful actions
like debt recovery or healthcare denial. 

 DESKHOG - A DEVELOPER TOY FROM POSTHOG (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 PostHog is creating DeskHog, an open-source, 3D-printed, palm-sized
device packed with features for developers to hack, play games, and
access PostHog data. 

 MARKDOWN NINJA (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Markdown Ninja is a markdown-first, open-source CMS for bloggers,
minimalists, and startups to easily publish websites and newsletters.
