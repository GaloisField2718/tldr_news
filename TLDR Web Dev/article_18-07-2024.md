ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE SPED UP NOTION IN THE BROWSER WITH WASM SQLITE (12 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Notion sped up its web browser application by implementing SQLite
caching using WebAssembly. It faced challenges with cross-origin
isolation and data corruption due to concurrency issues when multiple
tabs accessed the database simultaneously. Notion resolved these
issues by developing a SharedWorker architecture where only one tab
actively interacts with the SQLite database while others can still
make queries. It also addressed regressions like slower load times and
performance issues on slow devices by loading the WASM SQLite library
asynchronously and implementing a ‚Äúrace‚Äù mechanism between SQLite
and API requests. 

 DESIGN A GRAPHQL SCHEMA SO GOOD, IT'LL MAKE REST APIS CRY (9 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The first step to building a well-designed GraphQL schema is to
identify the core types in your domain, like Company and JobListing,
and then define the relationships between these types. Next, plan
query and mutation operations that clients can perform on your API,
such as creating or updating job listings. Finally, document your
schema thoroughly and use tools to visualize the relationships in your
schema. 

 JAVA VIRTUAL THREADS: A CASE STUDY (19 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Virtual threads in Java do not offer a clear advantage over Open
Liberty's existing autonomic thread pool for typical cloud-native Java
workloads. Open Liberty is an open-source, modular, cloud-native Java
application runtime. In CPU-intensive workloads, virtual threads
perform worse, with lower throughput than Open Liberty's thread pool.
However, virtual threads do ramp up faster from idle to maximum
throughput compared to Open Liberty's thread pool due to its
thread-per-request model.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY, AFTER 8 YEARS, I STILL LIKE GRAPHQL SOMETIMES IN THE RIGHT
CONTEXT (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Persisted queries are essential for a solid GraphQL API.
Authorization is a challenge regardless of API style. While there is a
need for `dataloader` to address performance concerns, the claim made
by others that authorization problems are unique to GraphQL is untrue.
GraphQL encourages continuous evolution, not breaking changes. It
allows for precise tracking of API usage. 

 A PYTHON EPOCH TIMESTAMP TIMEZONE TRAP (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Python's datetime module can cause confusion when converting between
timestamps and datetime objects due to timezone issues. The
time.time() function returns a timestamp relative to epoch (UTC),
while datetime.datetime.now() returns a timezone-naive object in the
local timezone. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results when
converting timestamps back to datetime objects on systems with non-UTC
timezones. 

 A TYPESCRIPTER'S TAKE ON ZIG (35 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This developer, who completes Advent of Code in a new programming
language every year, chose Zig for 2023 and found it to be a
modernized C with a unique approach to error handling and type
manipulation. Zig's standout features include detectable illegal
behavior and comptime, which offer improved error detection and
type-level programming capabilities respectively. However, Zig could
benefit from enhancements in developer experience, including a better
language server, clearer error messages, and improved documentation.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 IMPORT AND EXPORT MARKDOWN IN GOOGLE DOCS (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google Docs has introduced new features to convert Markdown to Docs
content and vice-versa, export Docs as Markdown, and import Markdown
files as Docs. 

 MAGIC CLI (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Magic CLI is a command line utility that uses LLMs to help you use
the command line more efficiently. 

 REACT-CODEMIRROR (WEBSITE) [12]

MISCELLANEOUS

 PANIC! AT THE TECH JOB MARKET (56 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The tech job market is facing a downturn due to rising interest
rates, which affect different types of tech companies differently. On
top of that, the hiring process in tech is often broken, relying on
standardized practices like coding tests and behavioral interviews
that may not accurately assess a candidate's abilities or experience.
Companies often have unrealistic expectations and job descriptions,
leading to burnout and high turnover. 

 JAILBREAKING RABBITOS: UNCOVERING SECRET LOGS, AND GPL VIOLATIONS (21
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 David Buchanan bought a Rabbit R1, a device that has been criticized
for its poor performance. He developed a tethered jailbreak that gives
root access to the device without making any permanent changes. He
also found that the device logs extensive user data, including GPS
location, WiFi network name, and nearby cell tower IDs. While Rabbit
Inc. has since addressed the logging issue and added a factory reset
option, Buchanan is still releasing his jailbreak tool to help other
researchers analyze the device. 

 ARTIFACTING (19 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The JPEG format became the dominant way to share digital photos
online due to its lossy compression, which allows for smaller file
sizes and faster transmission over the internet. Unlike the GIF, which
was created by a single person, the JPEG is a complete standard
designed to meet a range of industry needs. The format's success is
due to its ability to balance the need for photorealistic images with
the requirement for efficient delivery in limited bandwidth
environments.

QUICK LINKS

 CLOUDFLARE REPORTS ALMOST 7% OF INTERNET TRAFFIC IS MALICIOUS (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cloudflare's latest report reveals that nearly 7% of internet traffic
is malicious, driven by events like wars and elections, with DDoS
attacks being the primary weapon of choice. 

 I DON'T LIKE THE TERM ‚ÄúIC‚Äù EITHER (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The term "IC" (individual contributor) has negative connotations of
laziness and lack of ambition. 

 NSCOPYOBJECT, THE GRIEFER THAT KEEPS ON GRIEFING (9 MINUTE READ) [18]


 NSCopyObject is a very old Foundation function from the NeXT (Apple)
era that was originally just memcpy, but has become more complicated
over time, especially with the introduction of ARC in Mac OS X 10.6. 

 LEANER NPM PACKUMENT (METADATA) CONTENTS (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Starting today, the npm registry will begin removing README content
from package version metadata to reduce the size of package packuments
and improve the performance of the registry and package managers,
including the npm cli.
