ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 JAVASCRIPT BLOAT IN 2024 (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 JavaScript bundles on modern websites are much bigger than they need
to be, even for simple functionalities. Popular websites, like ChatGPT
and YouTube, have a high amount of client-side JavaScript bloat that
doesn't always match the functionality the page offers. Certain
websites, like adult websites, prioritize fast loading speeds and have
small JavaScript bundles. 

 PROBLEMATIC SECOND (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Leap seconds, added to account for variations in the Earth's
rotation, occur infrequently. They can lead to unforeseen software
errors and system failures due to inadequate testing and preparation.
While various approaches exist to handle leap seconds, Google's "leap
smear" method, which gradually distributes the extra second throughout
the day, offers a smoother and more predictable solution. Leap seconds
are planned to be abolished by 2035. 

 HOW SQL QUERIES WORK: SQL QUERY EXECUTION ORDER FOR TECH INTERVIEWS
(7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A database management system parses, optimizes, and executes a SQL
query in a specific order, starting with `FROM` and `JOIN` before
`SELECT`. The process includes steps like tokenization, execution plan
generation, data retrieval, filtering, sorting, and aggregation.
Understanding this execution flow helps in writing efficient queries
and optimizing database performance.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW I PLAN MY WEEK AS A SENIOR ENGINEER IN BIG TECH (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 This senior engineer uses an Excel spreadsheet to prioritize tasks
based on organizational goals, feedback, and time estimates. Over
three months, this helped them achieve 90%+ of their daily goals while
providing a clear record of accomplishments and reducing overplanning.


 PERSPECTIVE JUMPING: HOW TO FOCUS AS A SOLO-DEVELOPER (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Design problems, particularly for solo developers, can be prone to
fragmentation into smaller sub-problems, leading to a loss of focus on
the original issue. Timeboxing alone is insufficient to combat this,
as it lacks the necessary context and reasoning to refocus the
developer. To effectively manage this, a solo developer can write from
the perspective of different roles, like a marketer, manager, or
developer, to prioritize tasks properly. 

 NEW WEB DEVELOPMENT. OR, WHY COPILOTS AND CHATBOTS ARE PARTICULARLY
BAD FOR MODERN WEB DEV (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A paradigm shift is happening towards simpler web development that
utilizes built-in browser APIs. While this shift promises better
performance and cost savings, it requires a skill set that many
organizations and developers lack. LLMs are being used as a
workaround, but they are not well-suited to this new shift due to a
lack of relevant training data.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MY FINETUNED MODELS BEAT OPENAI'S GPT-4 (26 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This author evaluated several fine-tuned LLMs on structured data
extraction from press releases and found that they outperformed
OpenAI's GPT models. The evaluation process was challenging due to the
different locations and interfaces of the models. While the author was
pleased with the results, they also acknowledge the tradeoffs of
fine-tuning LLMs, such as the need for managing data and model
versions. 

 HOW GOOGLE MIGRATED BILLIONS OF LINES OF CODE FROM PERFORCE TO PIPER
(8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google's source control system initially relied on a single Perforce
server and faced scalability issues as the company grew. To address
this, Google engineers developed Piper, a distributed source control
system designed for massive scale. The migration from Perforce to
Piper took over four years due to the deep integration of Perforce
into Google's software ecosystem and the need to avoid disrupting
production. However, the migration was successful and Piper is still
used at Google today. 

 A GIT STORY: NOT SO FUN THIS TIME (32 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In 1998, Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux, was overwhelmed by the
growing number of code changes from developers. The solution they
found was BitKeeper, a distributed version control system. Linux
adopted BitKeeper in 2002, but its proprietary nature caused friction
with free software advocates. Frustrated, Torvalds started developing
Git, which gained popularity and became mainstream due to GitHub.
