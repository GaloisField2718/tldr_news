ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE PERFORMANCE INEQUALITY GAP, 2024 (24 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Just how much HTML, CSS, and (particularly) JavaScript can a new
project afford? The answer is ‚Äúmore than in years past, but much
less than frontend developers are still burdening users with‚Äù. This
post digs deep into this topic, particularly on how updated devices,
networks, and new metrics (INP) influence this, particularly for
websites that work on low-end devices. 

 THE TWO TYPES OF READABLE CODE (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There are two types of readability in code: beginner and expert.
Beginner readability focuses on making code easy to understand for
those new to programming or a particular language, while expert
readability focuses on making code easy to understand for experienced
developers. Both types of readability are important, but expert
readability is often more important in the long run as it allows
developers to write more concise and expressive code. 

 IMPROVE YOUR SQL SKILLS X2 IN 5 MINUTES (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Advanced SQL techniques such as Common Table Expressions, window
functions, and the use of the PARTITION BY command are useful for
developers who need to produce business insights and technical
designs. This article provides practical examples and exercises for
each technique.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ASK HN: HOW DO YOU ORGANIZE SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION AT WORK? (HACKER
NEWS THREAD) [8] 

 Commenters recommend various types of documentation. One type is
executable documentation, such as descriptive tests and asserts
throughout code. Another is timestamped documentation, like a doc with
the last time it was updated or detailed pull requests. Other forms of
documentation include Confluence, a documentation repository of
Markdown files, and design docs. 

 BUILDING TRUST AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEER (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The key to becoming a senior engineer isn't just about technical
skills - engineers need to build trust through reliability and
dependability. Consistently delivering on projects, communicating
challenges early, and maintaining a "streak" of successful outcomes
builds dependability and trust within teams and it allows senior
engineers to be entrusted with complex high-stakes projects. 

 IT'S NOT MICROSERVICE OR MONOLITH; IT'S COGNITIVE LOAD YOU NEED TO
UNDERSTAND FIRST (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A monolithic architecture with a focus on cohesive and modular
designs to match the team's cognitive load may be favorable for single
teams. Conversely, for multiple teams, microservices or similar
architectures allow for independent work but require well-designed
APIs to mitigate extraneous cognitive load. Software architecture is
ideally designed to fit the maximum team cognitive load to avoid
overstretching teams and ensure alignment between organizational
capacity and architectural decisions.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 VELVETTE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Velvette is a JavaScript library that implements common patterns on
top of CSS view transitions. It makes it easier to author CSS view
transitions by providing useful temporary classes while the transition
is active. Velvette can generate unique names and animate between list
and detail views. 

 REOR (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Reor is an AI note-taking app that automatically connects related
notes and answers questions based on them. It offers a semantic
search. Everything runs locally, with optional connections to APIs. By
embedding notes and utilizing vector similarity, Reor "self-organizes"
your ideas, drawing connections and surfacing related notes. 

 OINK.PHP (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 oink.php is a free and open-source API wrapper for PHP - in a single
file. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 FIXING SECURITY VULNERABILITIES WITH AI (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GitHub uses ‚Äúcode scanning autofix,‚Äù which uses AI to suggest
fixes for security vulnerabilities detected in codebases. The feature
integrates into existing code scanning workflows and provides users
with suggested fixes directly in pull requests. Autofix prompts LLMs
to suggest edits while ensuring code functionality remains unchanged. 

 NOT ALL TLDS ARE CREATED EQUAL (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are managed by individual
countries with no standardized regulations, leaving users vulnerable
to price hikes, domain cancellations based on changing political
climates, and unclear ownership rules. Examples include the recent
shutdown of "queer.af" by the Taliban and the Brexit-related issues
with ".eu" domains. While some ccTLDs might be useful for local
businesses or residents, gTLDs (global TLDs) may be better for their
lower risk and more consistent regulations.

QUICK LINKS

 INTERNAL TOOLS OFTEN MAKE BAD STARTUP IDEAS (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Y Combinator urges founders to build startups based on internal
tools. However, developer culture and career incentives often push
founders towards building internal tools instead of buying as they
value the "built it myself" badge over purchased solutions. 

 THE DANGERS OF OPTIMIZING FOR PERFORMANCE (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 It‚Äôs crucial to measure a component's actual impact on the whole
system when making optimizations. 

 GITLAB MEETING SIMULATOR 2024 (WEBSITE) [18] 

 A humorous website that plays one of GitLab‚Äôs internal remote
meetings. It allows users to pretend to be working by displaying video
on the screen.
