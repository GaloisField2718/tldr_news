ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PROFILING NODE.JS APPLICATIONS (13 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This guide explores profiling techniques to pinpoint high CPU usage
in Node.js applications. It covers using built-in profilers, Chrome
DevTools, the Node Inspector API, and the perf tool. The guide also
mentions continuous profiling for ongoing monitoring and explores
memory leak detection. 

 YOUR BAD LCP SCORE MIGHT BE A BACKEND ISSUE (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A poor Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) score can often be caused by
backend issues. While tools like Page Speed Insights and Google
Lighthouse are helpful for frontend analysis, tracing user journeys
and examining spans help uncover more issues. By doing so, developers
can pinpoint problematic database queries or other backend operations
that contribute to slow LCP scores.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOUR COMPANY'S PROBLEM IS HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Teams should focus on fewer tasks and allow for more downtime, which
counterintuitively leads to faster feature delivery and increased
value. When working on too many things at once, teams may actually
deliver things slower because there are too many things that are in a
work-in-progress state. Smaller, faster completions keep momentum
going. 

 WHY I SWITCHED TEAMS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This author switched teams to AI/ML Training Infra due to the fast
growth and opportunities in the AI space. They were also motivated by
curiosity about the technical challenges in AI compute efficiency and
the opportunity to work with talented engineers.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 JSON.BASH (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 json.bash is a command-line tool and bash library that creates JSON. 

 FAST-JSON-STRINGIFY (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 fast-json-stringify is a library that converts JavaScript objects to
JSON strings. It's faster than JSON.stringify, especially for small
payloads. 

 VUE LANGUAGE TOOLS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 A collection of Vue tools that help make development easier. This
includes a type-check command line tool, TypeScript plugins, VSCode
extensions, and more.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE SAD STATE OF PROPERTY-BASED TESTING LIBRARIES (90 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Property-based testing is a technique that originated from academic
research. It has seen widespread adoption in various programming
languages. However, most current libraries lack advanced features like
stateful and parallel testing, which were established as
state-of-the-art fifteen years ago. This lack of progress is due to
the perception that pure function testing is more valuable, the need
for specialized training for stateful modeling, and the success of
closed-source solutions in industry adoption. 

 STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO CHOOSING THE BEST EMBEDDING MODEL FOR YOUR
APPLICATION (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Choosing the right embedding model for search and RAG applications
requires considering your specific needs and evaluating different
models on your own data. The MTEB Leaderboard is a helpful starting
point, but validation on your own use case is necessary for the best
results. 

 HOW WE BUILD EXPERIMENTS IN-HOUSE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Canva's experimentation analysis platform started with a data
scientist-focused Python package and a command-line interface. It then
transitioned to an interface that could be used by all employees and a
separate microservice for analysis components. This allowed it to
manage experiments much easier in-house.
