 SPEEDING UP THE JAVASCRIPT ECOSYSTEM - TAILWIND CSS (11 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 A developer attempted to rebuild Tailwind CSS with performance in
mind in an effort to improve the performance of Tailwind CSS projects.
They optimized the extraction of potential Tailwind class names using
regex, reducing extraction time significantly. They also improved the
parsing of class names and generated CSS rules efficiently. The new
build time improved from 1.4 seconds to just 192ms, an almost 10x
improvement. 

 A DISCUSSION ON STATELESS & STATEFUL SERVICES (MANAGING USER STATE ON
THE BACKEND) (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stateless services are easier to scale in distributed systems as more
and more services can be added as load increases. However, for
stateful services, certain techniques must be used for scaling, such
as replication to external storage and distributed caching. In both
cases, techniques like load balancers and sticky sessions are used to
route traffic to the appropriate nodes. 

 FROM CHAOS TO COHESION: ARCHITECTING YOUR OWN MONOREPO (11 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The monorepo architecture is successfully implemented by tech giants
like Google and Meta. The approach helps developers to share code,
tools, and resources across teams and projects. This article outlines
steps to architect a simple monorepo, including organizing the code
and adopting a branching strategy like trunk-based development. It
suggests minimal requirements for implementing a monorepo and goes
through the steps of maintaining one.

 NIGHTWIND (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Nightwind is a Tailwind CSS plugin designed to provide a readily
customizable and replaceable dark mode feature. It harnesses the
established Tailwind color palette alongside your personalized color
choices to instantly produce dark mode variations of the Tailwind
color classes you employ. For example, when you apply a class like
bg-red-600, Nightwind seamlessly transforms it into bg-red-300 within
the dark mode setting. 

 TS-CHAN (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 The "ts-chan" module provides concurrency primitives for
TypeScript/JavaScript inspired by Go's channels. It offers
installation for Node.js, Deno, and browsers. The module addresses the
issue of microtask cycles in JavaScript programs involving concurrent
operations. It defines a protocol for implementing channels and
includes reference implementations of channels and a Select class. 

 VUEFORM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Vueform is an open-source framework for building forms in Vue.js. It
standardizes the entire form-building process and gives you the power
to customize styling, layout, and functionality while also taking
important things like rendering, validation, and processing. Vueform
comes with many form elements, like multi-file uploads and a date
picker, along with a complete theming and templating system.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BUILDING A HIGH PERFORMANCE JSON PARSER (22 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This is a case study of building a high performance JSON parser using
Go. The parser supports streaming operations to reduce latency.
Furthermore, the parser is compatible with the JSON API provided in
the Go language. The parser also offers its own API, which is more
efficient than the default JSON API. 

 HOW TO WRITE TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION THAT PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY READ
AND USE (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Good documentation is clear, reproducible, and doesn't assume the
reader's knowledge level. Documenting as you go along, rather than
waiting until the end, is recommended because it allows for capturing
details and maintaining clarity. Documentation should be modular so
that parts can be expanded or skipped as needed. It should be reviewed
by peers and ideally by potential users to ensure its
comprehensiveness and usability.
