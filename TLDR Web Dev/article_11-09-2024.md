ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING THE SAME APP USING VARIOUS WEB FRAMEWORKS (9 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 This developer built the same web application using different web
frameworks: FastAPI, FastHTML, Next.js, SvelteKit, and FastAPI
combined with Svelte. They compared the developer experience and
unique features of each framework by implementing CRUD operations in a
simple "Look at Your Data" app. FastAPI and FastHTML were more concise
in code, while Next.js and SvelteKit required more code but offered a
more structured approach and better UI elements. 

 A GOOD DAY TO TRIE-HARD: SAVING COMPUTE 1% AT A TIME (12 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Cloudflare's "pingora-origin" service processes a massive amount of
HTTP requests - a small function called "clear_internal_headers" was
identified as consuming a significant portion of its CPU time. To
optimize this function, Cloudflare explored different data structures,
eventually settling on a trie-based approach, which resulted in a new
open-source Rust crate called "trie-hard". The trie-hard
implementation reduced the CPU utilization of the function, achieving
a 1.28% decrease in compute time, which matters a lot at scale. 

 FEATURES OF YOUR FONT YOU HAD NO IDEA ABOUT (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 High-quality fonts have hidden features like variable axes for
customizing appearance, stylistic alternates for different letter
variations, swashes for decorative accents, and multiple numeral
styles. Each of these features can be accessed using CSS properties,
as shown with examples throughout this article.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GOOD SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT HABITS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This developer writes about a few software development habits that
have helped him write better software faster. They focus on writing
small commits frequently, refactoring continuously, and deploying
often. They also often write tests first to define API structures
early. 

 WHY I PREFER EXCEPTIONS TO ERROR VALUES (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Exceptions are a superior error handling mechanism compared to
returning error values. This is because exceptions offer a better user
and developer experience by providing more graceful error handling and
leading to faster execution. The common practice of using error values
in languages like Rust and Go leads to excessive boilerplate and has a
higher potential for hidden system errors. 

 SQLITE IS NOT A TOY DATABASE (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SQLite's serverless nature lets developers embed it directly within
applications, with a user-friendly console to provide straightforward
access. It also has data import and export, native JSON handling, and
advanced SQL capabilities like Common Table Expressions and set
operations.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 THE JOYS OF CONVERSATIONAL TICKETING: TURNING SLACK/TEAMS
CONVERSATIONS INTO JIRA TICKETS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Conversational ticketing uses chatbots and virtual assistants to
automate the way users create, update, and resolve IT service tickets.
Conversational ticketing is a popular choice for dev teams [10] as it
allows users to submit Jira tickets without leaving the tools they're
already on (like Slack or MS Teams). Read more on the Appfire blog
[10] 

 DEBUGGING IN THE MULTIVERSE (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Antithesis is a new debugging tool that allows software engineers to
rewind time and examine their code in various states. It simulates a
deterministic universe, allowing users to step back in time, replay
events, and analyze the code's behavior leading up to a bug or crash.
It also enables time-travel to the future, accelerating simulations
for faster debugging of networked systems. 

 VOMITORIUM (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Vomitorium is a command-line tool that recursively scans directories,
processes files, and compiles their contents into a single output
file. Its single output file is useful for working with LLMs, as you
can pass in the entire file as context for the LLM to process. 

 GOOGLE ILLUMINATE (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Google's AI tool, Illuminate, turns books and papers into audio
discussions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW WE MADE JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS LOAD 10 TIMES FASTER (17 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 SingleStore's Jupyter Notebook integration faced significant load
time issues. To address this, its engineering team implemented a
series of optimizations, including decoupling the Jupyter server from
the UI, mocking static requests, and pre-rendering the extension/UI.
These efforts resulted in improved load times, reducing the P90 from
around 30 seconds to 4 seconds, an 87% improvement. 

 GOING OPEN-SOURCE AS A VC-BACKED COMPANY (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Briefer is launching a free and open-source version of its software
while also offering a premium cloud-hosted version with more features.
It chose the AGPL license to make sure its software remains
open-source, deter competitors from copying it, and protect its
business model. It is doing this to build user trust and differentiate
itself from competitors like Tableau and Power BI.

QUICK LINKS

 DON'T DEFER CLOSE() ON WRITABLE FILES (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Deferring the `Close()` method for writable files in Go can be
harmful because it ignores the potential error return value. 

 LOOK OUT, KIDS: PHP IS THE NEW JAVASCRIPT (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This former JavaScript developer explores Laravel, a PHP framework,
and finds it surprisingly easy and enjoyable to use. 

 GOOGLE AND APPLE LOSE THEIR COURT FIGHTS AGAINST THE EU AND OWE
BILLIONS IN FINES AND TAXES (10 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The European Union's top court has imposed antitrust penalties
against Google and Apple, which means they now owe billions of dollars
in fines and taxes. 

 WHO USES ACCEPT-LANGUAGE HEADER? (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The Accept-Language header is not always respected by websites, like
Yelp.
