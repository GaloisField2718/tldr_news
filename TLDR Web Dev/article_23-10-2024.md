ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW VERCEL ADOPTED MICROFRONTENDS (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Vercel, once a single large Next.js application, switched to vertical
microfrontends for better build times and developer velocity. It
reduced dependencies, improved preview build times, and boosted
end-user performance by dividing its website into logical sections.
Vercel used Turborepo and Next.js Multi-Zones to manage the migration
process and implemented prefetching and prerendering techniques to
optimize performance and navigation. 

 HOW WE BUILT A NEW POWERFUL JSON DATA TYPE FOR CLICKHOUSE (22 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 ClickHouse has created a new JSON data type designed for
high-performance handling of JSON data. This new type overcomes the
challenges of storing and processing JSON data in columnar databases,
such as dynamically changing data types, data integrity, and large
datasets. 

 MAKING UBER'S EXPERIMENT EVALUATION ENGINE 100X FASTER (18 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Uber engineers improved the efficiency of their Experimentation
platform by shifting from a remote evaluation architecture to a local
one. This change reduced experiment evaluation latency by a factor of
100, from milliseconds to microseconds. The new architecture
distributes experiment data to all host agents, allowing microservices
to read experiment data locally without relying on a central service.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 INITIAL EXPLORATIONS OF ANTHROPIC'S NEW COMPUTER USE CAPABILITY (9
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic's new "Computer Use" API mode for its Claude model allows
the model to interact with users' computers through screenshots and
coordinate support. This author has experimented using the feature to
compile and run Hello World in C, install FFmpeg, use tools to count
database queries, and try to solve Sudokus. 

 WHAT DOCS AS CODE REALLY MEANS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 “Docs-as-code" goes beyond simply writing documentation using
developer tools. It means recognizing the importance of documentation
as software infrastructure. This requires shared responsibility and
standards and treating documentation with the same care and attention
as code.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING COMPUTER USE, A NEW CLAUDE 3.5 SONNET, AND CLAUDE 3.5
HAIKU (6 MINUTE READ) [9]

Claude 3.5 Haiku. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is an upgraded version of its
predecessor (with the same name) that is much better at coding.
Anthropic has also introduced an experimental beta feature, computer
use, which allows Claude to interact with computers like humans by
using a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text.

 ATTACKING THE SAMSUNG GALAXY A* BOOT CHAIN (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Quarkslab researchers discovered four vulnerabilities in the boot
chain of Samsung Galaxy A devices, enabling them to execute code in
the bootloader, gain root access with persistence, and leak data from
the Secure World, including Android Keystore keys. These
vulnerabilities affect two crucial components: Little Kernel, the
third bootloader, and Secure Monitor, the highest privileged software.
The researchers presented their findings at BlackHat USA 2024 and
released proof-of-concepts for the vulnerabilities on GitHub. 

 HOW I DEFEATED AN MMO GAME HACK AUTHOR (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 When this developer discovered an MMO game hack, he decided to learn
how to hack the game himself and make it more difficult for the hack's
author to keep up. Through clever code modifications and observation,
he was able to identify the hack's author and even the users who were
exploiting it. This led the hacking company to eventually abandon its
project. 

 THE STORY OF WEB FRAMEWORK HONO, FROM THE CREATOR OF HONO (10 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Hono is a fast, lightweight framework that runs on various JavaScript
environments, like Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, and Node.js.
Providing a "write once, run anywhere" experience, the framework has
various features like middleware, helpers, RPC, and server-side JSX.
It was initially built because the framework's creator felt that
creating applications for Cloudflare Workers was too verbose without a
framework.
