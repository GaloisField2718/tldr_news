ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW DISCORD'S LIVE STREAMING WORKS (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Discord's live streaming feature broadcasts users' screen activity to
others in their group. To achieve this, Discord uses OS-specific APIs
for screen and audio capture along with robust fallback mechanisms.
The captured video data is then encoded using codecs like VP8 and H264
for efficient transmission, with Discord servers handling quality
adjustments and routing for high-quality delivery to viewers. 

 POK√âMON GO: ARCHITECTURE OF THE #1 AR GAME IN THE WORLD (9 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Pok√©mon GO began as an iteration of Niantic's earlier
augmented-reality game, Ingress. It uses GCP‚Äôs scalability for its
massive player base. The game's architecture heavily utilizes Google
Kubernetes Engine for managing workloads and Spanner for its global
consistency and high transactionality in storing player and map data.
Niantic introduced Redis as an in-memory cache to handle the immense
traffic spikes during live events like Raid Battles. Pok√©mon GO uses
PushGateway for real-time notifications. 

 BEST PRACTICES FOR WRITING TESTS WITH REACT TESTING LIBRARY (10
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 To write effective tests using the React Testing Library, developers
should focus on using ByRole queries to target elements based on
accessibility roles. For simulating user interactions, one should use
the userEvent library rather than fireEvent. Utilize findBy* queries
and waitForElementToBeRemoved to manage asynchronous updates for more
robust tests.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FALSEHOODS PROGRAMMERS BELIEVE ABOUT TIME ZONES (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Time zones are complex. Rules and boundaries change frequently based
on political and geographical influences. Developers often
underestimate the challenge of handling time zones and their irregular
offsets, multiple names, and unpredictable changes by governments.
Building any system reliant on time zones requires careful
consideration of their complexities to avoid future errors. 

 KEEPING TRACK OF ENGINEERING-WIDE GOALS AND MIGRATIONS (9 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Yelp created an internal platform called EE Metrics to help
engineering teams manage technical debt and highlight important
company-wide engineering initiatives. EE Metrics provides teams with
detailed web pages outlining their technical debt and surfaces key
migrations or health metrics. The platform's Team Health Reports allow
teams to see critical audits and prioritize actions based on the
highest impact to the team. 

 LLMS ARE NOT ENOUGH‚Ä¶ WHY CHATBOTS NEED KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LLMs have impressive factual knowledge, but their reasoning abilities
remain limited, as they struggle with applying their knowledge to
novel queries. Explicit knowledge representation, such as databases or
knowledge graphs, is needed for reliable question-answering that
combines the factual recall of LLMs with efficient search
capabilities. However, designing these knowledge structures is not an
easy task.

 SALT LABS RESEARCH FINDS SECURITY FLAWS WITHIN CHATGPT ECOSYSTEM (18
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Researchers have identified significant security vulnerabilities
within the ChatGPT ecosystem that potentially allow attackers to
access users' accounts on third-party websites, such as GitHub,
without their consent. These vulnerabilities were found both in the
core ChatGPT platform and its plugins. They expose sensitive data and
enable account takeovers through exploitation of the OAuth
authentication process and other flaws in plugin frameworks. 

 COMPRESSING CHESS MOVES FOR FUN AND PROFIT (9 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This article explores efficient chess move encoding to reduce
database size and improve query speeds on a large chess website. The
author developed a custom encoding that represents moves using fewer
bits than standard text formats. This approach optimizes for common
move types (pawn moves, captures) and in a test case, the encoding
reduced file size by 74%.

QUICK LINKS

 A FORMULA FOR RESPONSIVE FONT-SIZE (1 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 The CSS formula ‚Äúfont-size: calc(1rem + 0.25vw);‚Äù enables
responsive font sizing, allowing text to scale smoothly across various
screen widths and removing the need for traditional media query
breakpoints. 

 C++ SAFETY, IN CONTEXT (28 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 This article lays out a comprehensive view of C++ safety issues,
advocating for cross-disciplinary collaboration across programming
languages and security communities to address various security and
safety threats within languages. 

 WRITE FOR OTHERS BUT MOSTLY FOR YOURSELF (4 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 The act of writing, particularly with the intention of public
sharing, forced this author to find and understand gaps in their own
knowledge, leading to deeper learning for themselves. 

 CHEERP (GITHUB REPO) [24] 

 Cheerp is a C/C++ compiler that optimizes code for WebAssembly and
JavaScript, enabling easy integration of existing C/C++ libraries and
