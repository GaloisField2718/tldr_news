ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 TYPES OF REACT COMPONENTS [2024] (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This is a comprehensive overview of the different types of React
components that have evolved since its release in 2013. It starts with
older, now deprecated methods like createClass and Mixins, then
transitions to Class Components, which were the industry standard
before the introduction of Function Components with React Hooks. The
article then focuses on the advantages of Function Components and
React Hooks, before ending off with React Server Components (the
latest addition to the React ecosystem). 

 HOW TO CONTROL A REACT COMPONENT WITH THE URL (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 React components can be controlled with the URL. An example is shown
in this post where URL query parameters are used as the single source
of truth for component state, making sure the component and URL stay
in sync across different actions. The useSearchParams Next.js hook is
used to read and update the URL parameters. 

 A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO NODE.JS ADDONS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Node.js addons are dynamic libraries written in C, C++, or Rust that
enhance Node.js applications by providing access to system-level
resources, improving performance, and integrating external native
libraries with JavaScript code. They are useful for
performance-critical tasks, interacting with hardware, and utilizing
existing native libraries. These addons work by using the Node-API
(N-API) to expose native functions to JavaScript, which are compiled
into a binary file (.node) and loaded into the Node.js application.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ASK HN: FOR THOSE WHO CAN CHOOSE TO GO TO THE OFFICE, AND GO, WHY DO
YOU GO? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [7] 

 Developers who choose to go into the office voluntarily value the
social aspect of office work, finding it great for collaboration,
mentorship, and maintaining mental health. Others appreciate the
separation of work and home life, the structured environment, and the
availability of better equipment and resources at the office. 

 ARE SCRUM MASTERS TOO MUCH OVERHEAD? (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scrum Masters can be unnecessary overhead, especially in startups and
scale-ups. Instead, Scrum should be a background process, allowing
teams to focus on delivering value rather than adhering to strict
Scrum practices. 

 I SOLVE PROBLEMS (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A developer migrated many of his servers from Linux to BSDs due to
their stability and reliability. He focuses on solving client problems
effectively rather than selling specific technologies, which has led
him to implement a variety of BSD solutions including OpenBSD for
security, NetBSD for longevity, and FreeBSD with ZFS for performance
and storage.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY GUMROAD DIDN'T CHOOSE HTMX (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Gumroad initially liked htmx for its new project, Helper, as it was
simpler than React. However, Gumroad ultimately used React/Next.js due
to htmx's limitations in handling complex user interactions, state
management, and scaling with the project's increasing complexity.
htmx's server-centric approach led to clunky solutions for features
like drag-and-drop, dynamic forms, and real-time collaboration. 

 OPENAI AND ANTHROPIC REVENUE BREAKDOWN (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI, with an estimated $5 billion annualized revenue, dominates
the consumer market with ChatGPT, while Anthropic, at $1 billion,
relies more heavily on its API business. Despite Anthropic's faster
growth, OpenAI still has a significant lead in the consumer market.
Both companies have substantial capital requirements and are betting
on reduced inference costs, price increases, and a shift towards
inference-time compute to improve profitability.

READ) [15]

implementation, local persistence, and real-time synchronization
across multiple devices.

 GOOGLE RECOMMITS TO HYBRID WORK SCHEDULE UNLIKE AMAZON (2 MINUTE

 THE UNSPOKEN RULES OF REACT HOOKS (4 MINUTE READ) [19]
