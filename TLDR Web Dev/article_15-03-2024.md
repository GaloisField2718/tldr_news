ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW FIGMA'S DATABASES TEAM LIVED TO TELL THE SCALE (20 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Figma's database team had to deal with hypergrowth that was starting
to outpace their database's capacity. To address this, they first
focused on vertical partitioning, which bought them time but was not a
long-term solution. They then embarked on a complex nine-month project
to implement horizontal sharding, tailoring their approach to Figma's
specific needs. To manage their horizontally sharded databases, they
built a service in Golang to support load-shedding, transaction
support, database topology management, and more. 

 COMPARING JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORKS PART 1: TEMPLATES (30 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 This is a thorough comparison of the template languages used by
React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte. It looks at how the frameworks define
and use components, event handling, and more advanced techniques like
slotting. While all four frameworks can do everything that was tested,
React still feels most natural to the author. 

 HTTP/2 AND HTTP/3 EXPLAINED (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 HTTP is the backbone of the web, and it is constantly evolving.
HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections and headers for better
efficiency. HTTP/2 improved performance with multiplexing (sending
multiple requests over one connection) and binary formatting. HTTP/3
is built on the QUIC protocol for enhanced performance on unstable
networks, overcoming issues with TCP and TLS. Currently, both HTTP/2
and HTTP/3 are widely used.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE CURSE OF THE SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Staying in a senior position for too long can hinder your future job
prospects. This is known as the "Curse of the Senior Software
Engineer" ‚Äì you become too experienced for typical Senior roles, but
lack the leadership experience necessary for higher-level positions.
To avoid this curse, either proactively pursue promotions and
leadership opportunities within your company or seek out companies
that offer less structured career paths. 

 WHY SOFTWARE PROJECTS FAIL (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Software projects often fail due to hidden complexities and human
factors rather than technical shortcomings. Overconfident developers
can underestimate task complexity and the challenges of using new
technologies or third-party dependencies. Inexperienced managers may
prioritize personal ambitions over project success, lack firm
leadership, or cave to every change imposed by higher-ups. Projects
can become zombies, draining resources without delivering value, as
stakeholders become reluctant to admit defeat due to fear or
embarrassment. 

 QUIETLY GOING INSANE WITH TOOLS & AUTOMATION (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This author started a project of automating a simple Unreal Engine
task, but it quickly spiraled into an overly complex solution. His
first attempt was a PowerShell script to delete specific project
folders, but this evolved into a full-blown Windows installer using
GitHub Actions to build a release. Eventually, he decided to use the
language Zig to build an executable for the script, but Zig‚Äôs
low-level nature proved hard to work with.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 PSD (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 PSD is a lightweight parser for Adobe Photoshop PSD and PSB files. It
can be used both in web browsers and Node.js, uses WebAssembly to
speed up decoding image data, and pulls in zero dependencies. 

 LAVAGUE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 LaVague is a framework that transforms natural language instructions
into browser interactions. 

 SKYVERN (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Skyvern automates browser-based tasks using LLMs and computer vision.

 ONBOARDING ROULETTE: DELETING OUR EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS DAILY (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 While automated testing is crucial for quality software and
preventing regressions, complex features can be difficult and
time-consuming to test, leading to situations where teams prioritize
building features over writing robust tests. In cases like this,
developers should consider alternative strategies like canary
releases, beta testing, and dogfooding. The startup in this article
decided to start automatically deleting an engineer's account daily.
This forced them to experience the onboarding process firsthand,
uncovering bugs and building empathy for the user experience. 

 THE MESSY REALITY BEHIND A SILICON VALLEY UNICORN (12 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 A VC-funded startup aiming to disrupt the local services industry
experienced rapid growth fueled by pressure from investors. To keep up
with demand, the company hired Filipino contractors to perform routine
tasks that software could technically handle. This allowed engineers
in San Francisco to focus on strategic initiatives and
experimentation, leading to significant user growth. The story
highlights how automation is not necessarily a reality for a lot of
engineering companies today. 

 WINNING A HACKATHON, LOSING MY SANITY (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Students created a "Spotify Wrapped" for student dining habits for a
hackathon by scraping data from Tufts University's outdated meal plan
portal. The project found numerous security flaws in the portal's
design, for example, session keys were stored in URL parameters and
guest access permissions were easily circumvented.
