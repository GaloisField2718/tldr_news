ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW FIGMA MIGRATED TO KUBERNETES (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma migrated from AWS ECS to Kubernetes because as the team's needs
became more complex, they were hitting the limitations of ECS.
Kubernetes, on the other hand, lets Figma avoid vendor lock-in,
benefit from the open-source community, and hire engineers with
previous Kubernetes experience. Figma migrated to Kubernetes over the
span of multiple months, making sure to loadtest, incrementally shift
traffic through weighted DNS, and use real workloads along the way. 

 PYTHON 3.12 VS PYTHON 3.13 – PERFORMANCE TESTING (10 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 A benchmark of Python 3.12 and Python 3.13 found that Python 3.13
generally outperformed Python 3.12, showing a geometric mean
improvement of 1.08x on the AMD system and 1.05x on the Intel system.
However, Python 3.13 experienced performance drops in some benchmarks,
especially in areas like coverage and regex on both systems. 

 UPGRADING UBER'S MYSQL FLEET TO VERSION 8.0 (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Uber's MySQL infrastructure underwent a major upgrade from version
5.7 to 8.0 to address security concerns and improve performance. The
company went for a side-by-side upgrade approach to minimize downtime,
reduce risk, and allow for thorough testing. The upgrade was a
multi-stage process with node replication, a soak period, traffic
diversion, and primary node promotion.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THAT'S NOT AN ABSTRACTION, THAT'S JUST A LAYER OF INDIRECTION (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Not all abstractions in software are beneficial. While good
abstractions hide complexity and simplify development, layers of
indirection often masquerade as abstractions, adding cognitive
overhead without real value. Abstractions are not free: they come with
costs in performance and complexity. 

 CODE REVIEW ANTIPATTERNS (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Reviewers can often hinder code review progress by nitpicking
endlessly ("Death of a Thousand Round Trips"), using reviews as
leverage for unrelated tasks ("Ransom Note"), or by constantly
contradicting each other ("Double Team"). Reviewers shouldn't act as
gatekeepers but keep the project's success in context. 

 HTML WHITESPACE IS BROKEN (46 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There are numerous issues with whitespace handling in HTML, from
unexpected rendering inconsistencies to formatting problems. A
possible solution is quoting strings in HTML to clearly differentiate
between significant and insignificant whitespace. A more pragmatic
solution would be adding a new HTML entity (&ncsp;) to represent a
non-collapsible space.

 TEACHING THE WORLD'S LARGEST PROGRAMMING LESSON (17 MINUTE READ) [16]


 This author taught 1,668 students the basics of Python in a Guinness
World Record attempt for the largest programming lesson. The lesson
was designed for beginners and covered topics like algorithms, basic
syntax, conditional statements, loops, and importing external code. He
used Sudoku as an example to illustrate how Python can be used to
solve real-world problems. 

 A BASIC TEST OF OPENAI'S STRUCTURED OUTPUT FEATURE AGAINST FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURE REPORTS AND A NEWSPAPER'S POLICE BLOTTER (30 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 OpenAI's Structured Output API feature can be used for data
extraction from images. This article shows how to define a data schema
using Pydantic and then use OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model to extract data
from screenshots of financial disclosure reports and newspaper police
blotters. 

 SPLITTING ENGINEERING TEAMS INTO DEFENSE AND OFFENSE (4 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 A startup founder's 4-person engineering team tackled the challenge
of balancing customer support and feature development by splitting
their team into "defense" and "offense" roles. Two engineers focused
on long-term projects in uninterrupted blocks while the other two
handled customer support, bug fixes, and other urgent tasks. This
"fortress" approach allowed the "offense" engineers to be more focused
and productive.
