ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CROWDSTRIKE'S IMPACT ON AVIATION (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CrowdStrike's software update on July 19th caused a massive IT outage
that impacted air traffic, particularly for major airlines like Delta,
United, and American, which experienced widespread cancellations.
While Southwest remained largely unaffected, Delta faced the most
severe consequences due to its reliance on Windows systems and a lack
of effective disaster recovery plans. Despite widespread disruptions,
the impact of the outage was systematically analyzed using ADS-B
Exchange data to compare takeoff rates before, during, and after the
update, providing insights into the scale and duration of the
disruption. 

 THE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL WORLD OF DNS LOC RECORDS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A rarely used DNS record type called LOC specifies a physical
location. While most DNS records handle basic website information, LOC
records are used to store geographical coordinates. A bug in
Cloudflare's DNS server (RRDNS) prevented it from serving LOC records
correctly. This post goes through it can be fixed. 

 HOW TO BUILD HIGHLY-DEBUGGABLE C++ BINARIES (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article is a comprehensive guide on making C++ binaries highly
debuggable, particularly for interactive debugging using tools like
gdb. It focuses on configuring the C++ toolchain to produce binaries
that are both efficient and easy to understand in the debugger. C++'s
ahead-of-time compilation model requires a deliberate choice between
debuggability and speed. The article presents various techniques,
including enabling sanitizers, debug modes, and frame pointers to
enhance the debugging experience.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO REVIEW CODE EFFECTIVELY: A GITHUB STAFF ENGINEER'S PHILOSOPHY
(15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Effective code review comes from clear communication, specific
feedback, and thoughtful questioning during reviews. Comments should
not be vague. People should also do a self-review before sending in
pull requests. 

 WHY UNKNOWN TYPES ARE USEFUL (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 When data originates from outside your program, its type cannot be
guaranteed, so assuming its type can lead to runtime errors. By
assigning "unknown" to unverified data, you force yourself to
explicitly validate its characteristics before using it, preventing
potential errors and improving code safety. While "any" can be
tempting to use, it disables type checking, which defeats the purpose
of using a type system.

 HOW TO SAVE $13.27 ON YOUR SAAS BILL (22 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This author was frustrated by Vercel's analytics pricing and decided

They found that SQLite could handle a significant amount of data with
reasonable performance, even under load testing. The author built a
basic analytics dashboard using HTML tables and a custom chart
component. 

 SIMULATING WORLDS ON THE GPU (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article describes a procedural earth simulation implemented

plates, and mountains, as well as hydraulic erosion and river basins.
It also includes a simplified climate model, generating realistic wind
circulation patterns and precipitation, and finally simulates the
evolution of life on the planet.
