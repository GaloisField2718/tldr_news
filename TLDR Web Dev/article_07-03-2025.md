ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FUNCTIONS IN CSS?! (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 CSS is getting function support, currently available in Chrome Canary
behind an experimental flag. These functions, defined with the
`@function` at-rule, can accept arguments with optional type-checking
and default values and return values using the `result` descriptor.
Though early returns and some features like list arguments aren't yet
fully supported, CSS functions promise to simplify complex CSS and
enable new possibilities, such as creating helper functions for fluid
typography and dynamic layouts. 

 A QUICK CRASH COURSE ON STATEFUL VS STATELESS ARCHITECTURE (10 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Stateful architecture remembers client sessions and uses that history
to inform operations, while stateless architecture processes each
request independently, without any knowledge of previous interactions.
Stateful systems have a better user experience and simpler client
logic but have complex scaling and failure recovery challenges. On the
other hand, stateless systems scale horizontally easily and are
resilient, but require heavier requests and potentially more client
complexity.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 IT'S PROBABLY TIME TO STOP RECOMMENDING REDUX (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Redux and other state management libraries are often unnecessary and
even detrimental for modern React development, especially for typical
enterprise applications. Instead of relying on global state managers,
devs should use API caching, browser caching, and props for managing
data. Most "state" is actually API data and proper component
modularization with `useState` and custom hooks can handle complex UI
state well enough in most cases. 

 HOW I CODE WITH LLMS THESE DAYS (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Using AI for coding well requires skill and a shift in development
practices. This developer recommends using Claude for coding, and to
generate code directly when possible instead of using small
convenience libraries. 

 AX, DX, UX (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 "Agent Experience" (AX) is the ease of use of using AI agents.
However, worryingly, prioritizing AX can possibly lead to the neglect
of User Experience (UX), similar to how Developer Experience (DX)
often overshadows UX due to resource constraints. Focusing solely on
making software usable for AI agents may result in a decline in
human-centric design, making software confusing for humans.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TEST YOURSELF: HOW WELL CAN YOU SPOT AND FIX VULNERABILITIES?
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 Are you confident in your secure coding skills [10]? See how your
expertise stacks up against industry best practices. This interactive
assessment will test your ability to identify and fix security
vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10 and CWE Top 25. Take the
Secure Coding Knowledge Assessment [9] 

 MISTRAL OCR (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Mistral OCR is a new Optical Character Recognition API that can
accurately understand elements like media, text, tables, and
equations. It's great at processing complex documents, has
multilingual capabilities, has top-tier benchmark results, and offers
structured output with document prompting. 

 SHADCN TABLE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This is a copyable table implementation with server-side processing
for sorting, filtering, and pagination built using the create-t3-app
stack. It uses TanStack Table, Drizzle ORM, and Neon database for
features like dynamic search filters, customizable columns, and
optional advanced filtering. 

 REVOLT (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Revolt is a free, cross-platform, open-source chat app designed with
user control and customization features. It has text channels with
image attachments and user mentions, along with community-building
tools like fine-grained permissions and mod tools.

 TRUSTING AI WITH MY IMAGES WASN'T EASY (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The founder of Drupal used AI to generate alt-text for 9,000 images
on his website. He was surprised to find that ChatGPT-4o at a low cost
often produced better and more detailed descriptions than he could
himself, even deciphering foreign languages and cultural contexts. 

 SUCCINCT DATA STRUCTURES (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 "Succinct data structures" compress data while still allowing for
efficient operations. Examples include rank/select bit vectors,
wavelet matrices, and FM-indexes, all of which have compact storage
and fast queries. 

 A QUICK JOURNEY INTO THE LINUX KERNEL (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This blog post goes into the Linux kernel, explaining the differences
between kernel and userspace programming, including memory management,
concurrency, and debugging. It also teaches key kernel concepts such
as processes, scheduling, system calls, data structures, interrupts,
and the virtual filesystem.

permissions and, in some cases, bricked users' systems. 

 WHY "ALIAS" IS MY LAST RESORT FOR ALIASES (5 MINUTE READ) [20]
