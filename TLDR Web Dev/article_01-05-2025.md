ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 GOOD VS GREAT ANIMATIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Using origin-aware animations, selecting the right easing (often
ease-out or custom curves), and using spring-based interactions gives
animations a more natural feel. Understanding CSS properties like
clip-path is also necessary for precise control and impactful effects.
These techniques when used together help create animations that
surpass "good" to look and feel "great." 

 CONCURRENT OPTIMISTIC UPDATES IN REACT QUERY (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Concurrent optimistic updates in React Query are tough, especially
when complex logic or multiple mutations are involved. Optimistic
updates can be improved by using query cancellation to prevent
inconsistencies from delayed queries. A strategy to prevent
over-invalidation after a mutation is by checking if related mutations
are already in progress before invalidating, thus avoiding UI
flickering.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AVOIDING SKILL ATROPHY IN THE AGE OF AI (19 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Relying too heavily on AI can lower critical thinking,
problem-solving skills, and overall understanding of code. Instead,
devs should use AI as a collaborator rather than a crutch. 

 THE ABYSMAL STATE OF CONTRACT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Contract devs often receive lower pay and benefits than full-time
employees, even though they have less job security. Miscommunication
about job roles is common, leading to contractors being assigned tasks
different from what was initially described. This situation results in
contractors getting the downsides of both contract and full-time work,
often feeling like second-class citizens.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AI FOR PROGRAMMERS MINI-MBA — BASIC PROMPTING TO PRODUCTION-READY
IN 6 WEEKS (SPONSOR) [8] 

 Google writes 25% of its code with AI. Are you keeping up? Section's
AI for Programmers Mini-MBA [8] takes you from basic prompting to
building production-ready AI applications — including vector
databases, RAG systems, and AI observability. Build a complete AI
project to showcase to employers! Join the waitlist by May 5 for
$1,000 off [8] 

 GEMINI CODER (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Gemini Coder is a free and open-source VS Code extension for
AI-assisted programming that prioritizes user control over context. It

MISCELLANEOUS

 ALL FOUR MAJOR WEB BROWSERS ARE ABOUT TO LOSE 80% OF THEIR FUNDING (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google heavily subsidizes the development of the four major web
browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. The US Department of
Justice is attempting to force Google to stop funding competitors and
divest from Chrome, arguing that these actions violate antitrust laws.
This action would eliminate over 80% of the funding for all of the
major browsers. 

 IT'S SCHOOL TIME! ADVENTURES IN HACKING KINDLE (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This developer repurposed an old Kindle into a school dashboard for
their daughter. The project involved jailbreaking the Kindle, setting
up SSH access, and creating a backend API using Cloudflare Workers to
fetch and display real-time weather, public transport data, and the
school timetable. The API renders this information into a grayscale
PNG image, which is then displayed on the Kindle's screen. 

 THE BEST – BUT NOT GOOD – WAY TO LIMIT STRING LENGTH (37 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 This deep dive into limiting string length shows the inconsistencies
and potential issues arising from different character encoding
methods. It goes over various encoding schemes like UTF-8, UTF-16,
Unicode code points, and grapheme clusters, showing how their
differing length calculations can lead to bugs and poor user
experiences across different layers of an application. Devs need to be
intentional and consistent with their chosen counting method and they
should understand how the programming language they use handles
strings. Counting by normalized Unicode code points is generally the
best approach.
