 GENERATE HANDWRITTEN SDKS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 ü§î Invest hundreds of hours your team doesn't have in maintaining
SDKs by hand‚Ä¶

ü§® ‚Ä¶or generate half-baked SDKs that leave a bad taste in your
users' mouths?

Those are two bad options.

Fortunately, you have a third choice‚Ä¶

üòç Use Speakeasy [4] to generate ergonomic, type-safe SDKs in over
10 languages [4].

Speakeasy's generator is designed based on input from language
experts, so it gets the details and the nuances just right.

Build SDKs that your team is proud of, and that other developers rave
about. Add OAuth2.0, custom code, retries, pagination and more.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE BUILT NGROK'S DATA PLATFORM (23 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ngrok built its data platform with an engineering team of just one
person, using open-source tools and self-hosting on Kubernetes. They
had challenges like complex schemas and large data volumes, which were
addressed through code generation, schema normalization, and scaling
Apache Flink with Protobuf messages. 

 DATA SYNCHRONIZATION (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 React Query tackles the challenge of data synchronization by keeping
the data displayed on the screen up-to-date with the server state. It
uses a "Stale While Revalidate" strategy, where data is considered
stale by default and refetched in the background when triggers like
changes in query keys, new component mounts, window focus, or device
going online occur. This allows for a smooth user experience with
instant data delivery while still making sure the cache stays
synchronized with the server. 

 PHRASE MATCHING IN MARGINALIA SEARCH (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A search engine added phrase matching by transitioning from
approximate word position storage to storing precise positions using
compressed lists. This change required implementing a new way to store
information about word occurrences within different document fields.
The ranking algorithm was upgraded to take advantage of the new phrase
matching capabilities, incorporating factors like phrase presence,
keyword distance, and early occurrence.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHEN TO DO WHAT YOU LOVE (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 If your main goal is to make money, you may have to compromise on
your passion, as most people pay you for what they want, not what you
want. However, if you are passionate about something that is also in
high demand, like a niche market, you can potentially earn a living
from it. Building a startup can be a viable option here, but mostly if
it arises from your own passions and interests. 

 THE GRUG BRAINED DEVELOPER (24 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This is a list of various pieces of advice on writing good software.
For example, good devs fight against complexity, say "no" to
unnecessary features, and embrace simple solutions. They are also
patient and refactor thoughtfully. 

 DON'T BE AFRAID TO RE-INVENT THE WHEEL (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Relying heavily on external codebases can create risks like security
vulnerabilities, dependence on third-party maintenance, and ongoing
integration work. It's fine to sometimes replicate external code from
packages in internal codebases because this gives developers better
control and security over that code.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 THE FRONT-END DEVELOPER KIT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 This collection of Datadog resources [11] is worth a bookmark for any
front-end developer (or anyone who finds themselves doing front-end
work). It includes a technical best practices guide, a solutions brief
on catching and resolving issues proactively, and a popular recorded
webinar on how to better monitor and optimize front-end apps. Access
all resources here [11] 

 HUMANIFYJS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 HumanifyJS is a tool that uses LLMs and Babel to deobfuscate,
unminify, transpile, decompile, and unpack JavaScript code, making it
more readable for humans. 

 FACAD (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Facad is a colorful directory listing tool for the command line that
features emoji-based file and directory icons, sorted output, support
for symlinks and executables, and customizable column width. 

 EVOLUTION API (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 EvolutionAPI is an open-source WhatsApp integration API that provides
a RESTful API service for controlling WhatsApp functions, allowing
users to create multiservice chats, service bots, and other systems
utilizing WhatsApp.

 DO AI COMPANIES WORK? (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI companies face economic challenges due to the high costs of
building and maintaining models. As newer and more advanced LLMs
emerge, older ones quickly become obsolete, making it easy for a
company to be left behind. Now, companies must either spend enormous
amounts of money to stay ahead or risk falling behind and losing
market share. 

 EPIC IS SUING GOOGLE ‚Äî AGAIN ‚Äî AND NOW SAMSUNG, TOO (8 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Epic Games is suing Google and Samsung. The lawsuit focuses on
Samsung's "Auto Blocker" feature, which makes it difficult for users
to install apps from third-party stores. Epic argues that Auto Blocker
is designed to protect Google and Samsung's app stores, not users, and
that it is blocking the growth of the Epic Games Store. 

 NO SUCH THING AS EXACTLY-ONCE DELIVERY (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The difference between delivery and processing in messaging systems
is that delivery refers to the act of successfully transferring a
message to a receiver, while processing covers the entire message
lifecycle, including delivery, processing by the receiver, and
acknowledgement. Sequin is a Postgres streaming library that
prioritizes exactly-once processing by making sure that every message
is delivered, processed, and acknowledged without duplication.
Achieving exactly-once delivery is practically impossible due to the
two-phase commit problem - confirming the simultaneous confirmation of
message delivery across different locations.
