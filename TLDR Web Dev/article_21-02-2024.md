 SCALING CHATGPT: FIVE REAL-WORLD ENGINEERING CHALLENGES (21 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 100 million people were using ChatGPT weekly by November 2023.
Scaling ChatGPT to such a large user base was not an easy feat. OpenAI
faced a few key challenges when scaling: managing GPU RAM, avoiding
cache misses, finding the right batch size, measuring the right
metrics, and handling a shortage of GPUs. The company found that
taking a system-wide approach to optimization and being adaptable in
the face of changing constraints allowed it to scale efficiently. Many
of the lessons learned are applicable to general software systems. 

 BLOOM FILTERS (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bloom Filters are a probabilistic data structures useful for checking
membership in a set with efficient space usage. They store information
using bits and hash functions and offer fast membership checks. They
can give false positives (claiming an item exists when it doesn't),
but they never give false negatives (missing an item that exists). In
the real world, Bloom filters are commonly used for caching and
distributed databases. 

 MODERN CLIENT-SIDE ROUTING: THE NAVIGATION API (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SPAs (Single Page Applications) are defined by a core feature: they
dynamically rewrite their content as users interact with them instead
of the default method of loading entirely new pages from the server.
SPAs are able to provide this feature via the History API, a clunky
API developed long before SPAs were the norm. The Navigation API is a
newly proposed API that completely overhauls this space that promises
to be easier to adapt. This page describes the Navigation API at a
high level with code examples on popular usages.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 IN DEFENSE OF SIMPLE ARCHITECTURES (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Simple architectures can be surprisingly effective, even for
large-scale applications. For example, Wave is a $1.7B fintech company
with a CRUD app built on a Python monolith and Postgres database. The
benefits of this simple architecture include lower cost, easier
maintenance, and faster development. There are some areas where
complexity is unavoidable, such as telecom integrations. Simple
architectures are a good choice for many businesses, especially those
that are not ad-supported or businesses without high traffic levels. 

 PLANNER PROGRAMMING BLOWS MY MIND (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Picat is a research language that combines logic programming,
imperative programming, and constraint solving. ‚ÄúPlanning" in Picat
is when the program finds variable mutations to reach a desired end
state. Instead of defining algorithms, Picat defines starting states,
actions, and final states, allowing the program to find solutions
through mutations. Planning helps minimize cost and is best used for
applications in AI, robotics, and video games. 

 CODING INTERVIEWS ARE EFFECTIVE (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Coding interviews are effective for companies despite their
limitations because they help minimize the risk of hiring bad
candidates. While there are downsides to coding interviews, like
pressure and filtering out good candidates who don't perform well,
they can be useful for assessing a candidate's problem-solving skills
and their potential as a future teammate. Automated assessments
aren‚Äôt as reliable as they lack human interaction and can‚Äôt always
catch cheating.

 SSDS HAVE BECOME RIDICULOUSLY FAST, EXCEPT IN THE CLOUD (4 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Cloud storage performance lags far behind the advancements in SSD
technology. Major cloud vendors are offering read/write speeds 10x
slower than high-end SSDs available on the market. The reasons for
this big difference are unclear but could be due to concerns about SSD
durability, lack of demand, or potential disruption to existing cloud
storage services. 

 ADDING KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS TO A 24 YEAR OLD GOVERNMENT WEBSITE WITH
USERSCRIPTS (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This author spent a year cleaning medical device data from the FDA's
510k database website. The website's interface was outdated and lacked
functionalities like fuzzy search and keyboard shortcuts. To save time
and improve their workflow, the author wrote userscripts to automate
repetitive actions by adding shortcuts for opening search, focusing on
search input, and copying device ID. 

 YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING WITH GPTS AT WORK (11 MINUTE READ) [19]
