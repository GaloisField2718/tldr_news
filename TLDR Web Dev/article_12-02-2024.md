ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FROM MANY TO ONE: MOVING OUR JAVASCRIPT CODE INTO A MONOREPO (10
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Aha! transitioned JavaScript code into a monorepo to streamline
development. Initially, the company used private npm packages for code
reuse, but the process required them to make changes to private npm
packages, which quickly slowed them down. Its team evaluated several
tools to do the repo migration efficiently, ultimately choosing
Turborepo in conjunction with pnpm. This setup maintained git history,
simplified its codebase, and enhanced the development workflow without
adding unnecessary complexity. The transition has led to significant
time savings and reduced frustration for its engineering team. 

 FROM 20S DOWN TO 1S: HOW WE SHAVED OFF 19S FROM OUR GRAPHQL API
QUERIES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A team was looking to optimize GraphQL query time and explored
several options like pagination, reducing the number of nested
queries, caching, filtering, and more. However, one approach was the
most effective and reduced large GraphQL query time from 20 seconds to
1 second. They did this by optimizing SQL queries against the database
and it‚Äôs very simple - instead of using SELECT *, specify the
columns you want. This will reduce payload size and reduce database
overfetching. 

 HOW I WRITE HTTP SERVICES IN GO AFTER 13 YEARS (24 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article covers in-depth service testing, optimizing startup and
shutdown, avoiding global state, handling common request types, and
controlling the environment through flags, and environment variables.
When writing HTTP services in Go, the author only uses one HTTP
handler per service and relies on HTTP routes to divert traffic to the
right handlers within each service. Functions are used as handlers and
dependencies are passed as arguments.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY BLOAT IS STILL SOFTWARE‚ÄôS BIGGEST VULNERABILITY (10 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The excessive complexity and size of modern software leads to
vulnerabilities and security breaches. Okta, Microsoft, and Apple
users have been hacked multiple times over the past few years due to
the amount of code surface area available for hackers to exploit. A
return to minimalistic yet functional software development practices
can help reduce security issues in modern software. 

 FINDING A NEW SOFTWARE DEVELOPER JOB (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 After being laid off, this author had trouble finding a new job. He
detailed all the ways he made himself open to new opportunities,
utilizing LinkedIn, job ads, and specialized platforms. Throughout the
process, he maintained meticulous tracking of applications and learned
to navigate salary negotiations and technical assessments. The author
details his entire journey from start to finish, with transparency and
tips along the way. 

 IT'S TIME TO BREAK FREE FROM CORPORATE AGILE (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Agile methodologies in corporate environments ("Corporate Agile")
commonly have bloated processes and misplaced priorities, shown by
excessive meetings and too many middle managers. A return to "Basic
Agile," with an emphasis on principles over rigid processes, will
allow teams to self-organize and adapt under uncertainty. Basic Agile
done right has a focused, quick daily meeting to discuss potential
blockers, short sprint planning sessions, and immediate issue
resolution.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ANNOUNCING REACT NATIVE FOR APPLE VISION PRO (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 React Native is now available for developing applications for the
Apple Vision Pro. 

 HURL (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Hurl is a command line tool designed to execute HTTP requests
specified in a straightforward plain text format. It offers features
such as request chaining, value capturing, and query evaluation on
response headers and bodies, making it suitable for both data
retrieval and HTTP session testing. Hurl supports working with various
types of APIs, including HTML, REST, SOAP, GraphQL, XML, and JSON. 

 LEO (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Leo is a functional, statically typed programming language designed
for creating private applications. It abstracts low-level
cryptographic concepts, facilitating the integration of private apps
into existing systems by compiling to circuits, making zero-knowledge
proofs feasible. Leo offers developers tools for circuit sanity
checks, including unit tests, integration tests, and console
functions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FIGURE OUT WHO'S LEAVING THE COMPANY: DUMP, DIFF, REPEAT (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 A system called "epitaphs" at a company this author worked at had
entries for departed employees. The company‚Äôs employees also created
their own system to track changes in the employee directory, allowing
for insights into departures and other events. The author provides
technical details for implementing similar systems which can be
created informally at other companies to help employees have a better
sense of layoffs and departures. 

 RSS IS STILL PRETTY GREAT (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds are useful for consuming
high-quality content with minimal noise. They are a good way to access
thoughtful long-form content without the distractions often found on
social media platforms. Despite some criticisms, such as a lack of
discoverability and non-tech-savvy user-friendliness, RSS remains a
valuable tool for content consumption due to its control, reduced
low-value content, and just-in-time access to information. They are a
relic of the ‚Äúold web‚Äù in today‚Äôs algorithm-dominated world, but
as AI floods algorithms, RSS may make a comeback. 

 POWER OF SMALL OPTIMIZATIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Small optimizations can go a long way in improving performance. There
are three categories of optimizations: architecture, algorithms and
data structures, and source code. To find opportunities for small
optimizations, one can use profiling applications and try utilizing
things like hybrid algorithms.

 WEB DEVELOPMENT IS GETTING TOO COMPLEX, AND IT MAY BE OUR FAULT (22
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Web development has an overwhelming number of frameworks and tooling
available today, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs gotten
more complex. It‚Äôs becoming easier to over-engineer web
applications. 

 I'M AN ENGINEER THAT NEEDS TO SELL MY SERVICES. ANY GOOD BOOKS ON
SALES? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [18] 

 Hacker News commenters offer advice on sales, such as developing
strong branding and understanding the client‚Äôs purchasing authority.
They also suggest books like Never Split the Difference and Draw to
Win. 

 WHY COMPANIES ARE LEAVING THE CLOUD (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Many organizations are moving their cloud-based workloads back to
on-premises infrastructures due to security concerns, unmet
expectations, and unexpected costs - 43% are finding cloud migration
more expensive than anticipated.
