ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 YOU CAN SERIALIZE A PROMISE IN REACT (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 React Server Components enable a unique pattern where promises can
start on the server and finish on the client. While JSON can't
serialize promises, React 19 provides built-in solutions through
`renderToReadableStream` (server) and `createFromReadableStream`
(client). This allows for smooth data flow between server and client
components, supporting over 20 data types beyond just promises. 

 INSTAGRAM'S RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM SCALING (19 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Instagram scaled its recommendation system to over 1,000 ML models by
fixing infrastructure maturity gaps. They built a model registry for
central model management, automated the launch process to reduce time
from days to hours, and implemented model stability metrics to monitor
prediction accuracy. 

 I THINK THE ERGONOMICS OF GENERATORS IS GROWING ON ME (16 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 JavaScript generators (created with `function*` and `yield`) are
great ways to work with sequences of values. They provide lazy
evaluation, encapsulate their own state, and simplify recurring tasks
like pagination. Unlike traditional approaches, generators separate
concerns by managing their own internals, making code more
maintainable.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GEMINI DIFFUSION (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Gemini Diffusion is Google's new LLM. It uses diffusion instead of
autoregression for text generation. Initial impressions show that it
is exceptionally fast, with Google claiming similar performance to
Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite but five times faster. 

 LLM FUNCTION CALLS DON'T SCALE; CODE ORCHESTRATION IS SIMPLER, MORE
EFFECTIVE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Relying on LLMs to directly process the output of tool calls,
especially large JSON blobs from MCP servers like Linear and Intercom,
is inefficient and expensive due to token limits and potential data
inaccuracies. Instead, parsing the structured data returned by these
tools and having the LLM orchestrate code execution for data
processing is a more scalable and reliable approach.

 AN UPGRADED DEV EXPERIENCE IN GOOGLE AI STUDIO (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google AI Studio has been upgraded with new features for developers
to build and deploy AI applications more easily. The updates include
Gemini 2.5 Pro code generation with a native code editor and a "Build"
tab for quickly creating and deploying web apps. The platform also now
offers native audio capabilities, including natural audio dialog in
the Live API and text-to-speech (TTS) features, as well as support for
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and a new URL Context tool.

that helps make the creation of JavaScript and TypeScript libraries
easier. 

 AWESOME TAILWIND ANIMATIONS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Awesome Tailwind Animations is a Tailwind CSS plugin for easily
adding animations to web elements using pre-defined classes. It has a
variety of animations like fade-in and slide-in, as well as utilities
for controlling animation delays and durations.

 GEMINI FIGURED OUT MY NEPHEW'S NAME (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This developer created an MCP server for their email indexed with
Notmuch, allowing Gemini read-only access through search and retrieval
tools. Gemini was tasked with finding his nephew's name buried within
the emails. After numerous search queries and retrieving email
content, Gemini correctly deduced that the nephew's name was Monty,
even though the relevant email never explicitly stated their
relationship. 

 INCIDENTS FROM GENERATIVE AI CLOUD SERVICES HIT DIFFERENT (7 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 A Microsoft study analyzing GenAI cloud service incidents revealed
they take much longer to mitigate than non-GenAI incidents, primarily
due to infrastructure-related issues. GenAI services also face unique
challenges like performance degradation, deployment failures, and
invalid inference, requiring more complex and time-consuming
mitigation methods. 

 GOOGLE'S AI AGENTS WILL BRING YOU THE WEB NOW (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 At Google I/O 2025, Google showed its new strategy for bringing the
web to users through AI agents that can converse, summarize, and even
shop on their behalf. These AI agents, including Project Mariner and
Deep Research, give users a more hands-off, personalized information
retrieval experience.
