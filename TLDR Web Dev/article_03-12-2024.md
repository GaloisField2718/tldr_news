ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 NEXT-LEVEL FROSTED GLASS WITH BACKDROP-FILTER (23 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This article shows how to create a highly optimized "frosted glass"
effect using CSS `backdrop-filter` and `mask-image`. The standard
`backdrop-filter: blur()` only blurs elements directly behind the
target, so the author introduces a technique using a larger masked
element to include nearby content in the blur. This solution addresses
issues like unclickable elements (using `pointer-events: none`) and
flickering at the viewport edges (using a background gradient). 

 REACT DATA FETCHING PATTERNS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article explores common data fetching patterns in React
applications, focusing on how data is fetched within components. It
focuses on sequential fetching (where data fetches depend on each
other) and parallel fetching (where multiple fetches happen
concurrently using `Promise.all`). It also goes over prefetching data
to improve perceived performance.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BUILD SOFTWARE AND YOU DON'T EITHER (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The long-term consequences of architectural decisions don't become
apparent for several years. This makes it nearly impossible to
accumulate enough experience to definitively answer questions like
microservices vs monoliths. Personal opinions are often shaped by
early career experiences. 

 WHAT IS AI ENGINEERING? (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI engineers are different from ML engineers in that they focus more
on MLOps and data integration. Generally, AI engineers build AI
systems that solve real business problems using pre-trained models and
advanced techniques like Agentic RAG.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FAILED AND FLAKY TESTS SLOWING DOWN YOUR MERGES? (SPONSOR) [8] 

 Flaky tests are incredibly frustrating — as is digging through CI
logs to find which line of code caused a test failure. Use Codecov
Test Analytics [8] to separate flaky tests from legitimate failures,
highlight code that led to failed tests, and improve your test suite
over time with detailed stats. Faster merges, less rage-quitting your
IDE. Try Codecov by Sentry [8] 

 WHAT'S NEW IN SVELTE: DECEMBER 2024 (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Svelte's December 2024 update includes Svelte 5 bug fixes, CLI
improvements, automatic type declarations, and more support from
several UI libraries like Shadcn, Zag, and Skeleton. 

 KLONGPY (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 KlongPy is a high-performance Python implementation of the Klong
array language that leverages NumPy for vectorized operations. It
supports CPU and GPU backends. KlongPy seamlessly integrates with the
Python ecosystem for data analysis and distributed computing
applications. 

 SEEKSTORM (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 SeekStorm is an open-source, high-performance, sub-millisecond
full-text search library and multi-tenancy server written in Rust with
a focus on low latency and scalability. It offers features like
faceted search, geo-proximity search, and real-time indexing.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE BEAUTIFUL MATH OF BLOOM FILTERS (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures that efficiently
check if an element exists within a large dataset. They achieve this
by using an array of bits and multiple hash functions to map elements
to bit positions - a set bit suggests presence, while an unset bit
definitively indicates absence. Bloom filters can produce false
positives (incorrectly indicating presence), but filters' size and
number of hash functions can be optimized through mathematical
analysis, minimizing this probability. 

 C++, COMPLEXITY, AND COMPILER BUGS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 C++ has some inherent complexities which are often due to subtle
language features like temporary lifetime extension and designated
initializers, which vary across different compiler versions. These
inconsistencies and unexpected behaviors, sometimes only discovered
after extensive debugging and consultation with language experts, show
the large amount of time and effort required to work with the language
effectively.

 FACEBOOK'S LITTLE RED BOOK (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Now publicly available digitally, Facebook's internal "Little Red
Book” is a manifesto preserving its founding ethos and illustrating
how storytelling scales culture during rapid growth. 

 DIFF TEXT (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Paste two chunks of text and find the difference in lines, words, or
characters. 

 STARTING OFF RIGHT: WHERE AUTOFOCUS SHINES (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The `autofocus` attribute in HTML improves user experience on
single-purpose pages like login forms by automatically focusing the
first input field. 

 RUST SOLVES THE ISSUES WITH EXCEPTIONS (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Rust's error handling, unlike exception-based systems, provides a
more robust and predictable approach by explicitly handling errors as
values. 

 INTEL ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT OF CEO PAT GELSINGER (9 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired - David Zinsner and Michelle
Johnston Holthaus were named interim co-CEOs, with Holthaus also
appointed CEO of Intel Products.
