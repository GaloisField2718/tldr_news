grant third-party applications access to their data without sharing
their credentials directly. This post goes over the history and
security concerns addressed by OAuth2. It then dives into the
different OAuth2 flows (authorization code, implicit, client
credentials, resource owner credentials, and device code), outlining
their functionalities, security implications, and appropriate use
cases.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DISCOVERY CODING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Discovery coding is a programming approach where developers write

MISCELLANEOUS

 AN INTERVIEW WITH MOJO, MLIR, SWIFT, CLANG, AND LLVM CREATOR CHRIS
LATTNER (15 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Chris Lattner discusses his new programming language, Mojo, which is
designed to greatly increase the speed of Python code. Mojo's compiler
uses MLIR and LLVM, differing from traditional compilers by directly
generating MLIR declaration nodes instead of a syntax tree. MLIR is a
software framework for compiler development. Lattner reflects on his
approach to open-sourcing projects, which was initially driven by a
desire for collaboration and later prioritizing focused development
before public release. 

 THE LITTLE BOOL OF DOOM (15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A Fedora Linux package rebuild failed due to a compilation error in
the Chocolate Doom game engine caused by the new GCC 15 compiler's
default C standard changing from GNU17 to GNU23. The error was from a
custom boolean type in the engine conflicting with C23's keywords. The
issue was resolved by modifying the engine's code to use the built-in
`bool` type when compiling with C23.
