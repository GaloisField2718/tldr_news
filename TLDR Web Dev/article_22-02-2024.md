ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REACT TRENDS IN 2024 (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 React has multiple trends in 2024 in various categories. On the UI
side, headless libraries with barebones components are gaining
popularity along with utility-first CSS like Tailwind CSS. There are
multiple emerging frameworks and tools, like Astro for static
websites, authentication solutions like Supabase, tRPC for maintaining
type safety, and TanStack Router for routing in single-page React
apps. Some paradigm shifts that will continue in 2024 are the usage
increase of React Server Components, better compilers and bundlers,
and a push towards the edge of better performance. 

 REACT LABS: WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON ‚Äì FEBRUARY 2024 (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The React Compiler is now in production on Instagram. It
automatically re-renders only the necessary parts of a UI upon state
changes. The React team has been adding features to React Canary,
which allows early adoption of stable features before official
release, like Server Components and Actions. Actions in React can
handle data submissions in both client-only and client-server apps and
it offers features like optimistic updates and form state management. 

 A BRIEF HISTORY OF AIRBNB'S ARCHITECTURE (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Airbnb started as a monolithic Ruby-on-Rails application and
eventually moved to a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). The SOA
approach aimed for loosely coupled services with focusing on clear
data ownership, specific concerns for each service, and avoiding
functionality duplication. Airbnb's migration journey involved
multiple iterations, with the final version completely eliminating its
monolithic architecture. Pros of SOA include increased reliability and
scalability, while cons include increased development time and
complexity. Airbnb also uses an in-house API framework, automated
canary analysis with Spinnaker, and Powergrid for parallel task
execution to support its SOA.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FALSEHOODS JUNIOR DEVELOPERS BELIEVE ABOUT BECOMING SENIOR (8 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Senior developers don‚Äôt have all the answers and seniority
doesn‚Äôt always guarantee job security. Seniors often have a harder
time juggling work-life balance and leading projects can be an anxious
endeavor. Boring tasks, like meetings, documentation, and code
reviews, are part of the deal, as is dealing with legacy code. 

 THE KILLER APP OF GEMINI PRO 1.5 IS VIDEO (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google's new language model, Gemini Pro 1.5, has impressive vision
capabilities - it can process video and extract structured content.
This author tested the model with videos of bookshelves and was able
to get a JSON array of the titles and authors of the books in the
videos. While there are limitations, such as safety filters and the
model sometimes hallucinating incorrect details, Gemini Pro 1.5‚Äôs
large context window makes analyzing video much easier compared to
other LLMs. 

 WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT SOFTWARE INTEGRATION WRONG FOR THE PAST 50
YEARS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article proposes a new approach to software integration called a
"Schema Network". Instead of building integrations from scratch using
each software‚Äôs APIs, Schema Network aims to reuse existing
integrations by composing them through a network of apps and
integrations. This offers a more efficient, wider coverage of software
integrations compared to current methods.

 IMESSAGE WITH PQ3: THE NEW STATE OF THE ART IN QUANTUM-SECURE
MESSAGING AT SCALE (16 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Apple has added PQ3 to iMessage. PQ3 is a new post-quantum
cryptographic protocol that offers strong protection against current
and future threats from quantum computers. It surpasses the security
of all other widely available messaging apps by achieving Level 3
security. PQ3 features post-quantum encryption, a self-healing key
mechanism, a hybrid design, and formal verification that ensures
security. 

 SMUGGLING MALWARE IN TEST CODE (10 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 A npm package called execution-time-async had malicious code hidden
in it that was designed to steal login credentials and passwords from
various browsers. The attacker, who has been identified, used various
tactics to hide the malicious code, including obfuscation and placing
it in a seemingly innocuous test file. They seem to be targeting
software developers, possibly through social engineering schemes.
