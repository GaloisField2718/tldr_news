 BUILDING AND SCALING NOTION'S DATA LAKE (14 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 As Notion grew exponentially, it had to build a scalable data lake.
Its solution involves incrementally ingesting updated data from
Postgres to Kafka, then using Hudi to write to S3 for processing.
Spark is used for complex tasks like tree traversal and
denormalization. This approach has resulted in cost savings, improved
data freshness, and has unlocked new possibilities for AI and search
features. 

 HOW WE SAVED 300MS FROM EVERY AWS POD STARTUP WITH A SINGLE GRAFANA
LOKI QUERY (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Checkly, a synthetic monitoring tool, reduced its pod startup time by
optimizing the AWS SDK and changing the order of operations. It
initially used large containers with long startup times, but switching
to ephemeral pods required a faster startup. The company found that
multiple versions of the AWS SDK were causing delays. Standardizing
the version led to a bunch of savings in compute costs. 

 SPEEDING UP THE JAVASCRIPT ECOSYSTEM (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TypeScript's new isolated declarations feature simplifies code
packaging by automatically generating .d.ts files. This improves the
"go to source" functionality and also removes the need to manually
create these files. It makes publishing packages faster by shifting
definition file generation from the publishing process to the
installation process.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 "GITHUB" IS STARTING TO FEEL LIKE LEGACY SOFTWARE (4 MINUTE READ) [7]


 GitHub is starting to decline in quality and is showing signs of
legacy software. A recent issue with the blame view feature, which
appears to be caused by a React frontend rewrite, is evidence of this
decline. GitHub's priorities may have shifted. 

 WORKING WITH STACKED BRANCHES IN GIT IS EASIER WITH --UPDATE-REFS (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Git 2.38 introduced the --update-refs feature to streamline the
process of rebasing stacked branches. This new feature automatically
updates dependent branches when the base branch is rebased,
eliminating the need for manual rebasing and potential conflicts. It
can be used in various scenarios, including rebasing a stack of
branches, updating stacked branches on a changed branch, and
interactive rebasing.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 üëÄ OBSERVING AWS MICROSERVICES (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Join Lumigo CTO, Aviad Mor, and AWS Serverless Hero, Yan Cui! On the
agenda: why observability for AWS microservices [9] has gotten so
expensive and complicated [9] ‚Äî and what you can do about it.
Featured topics include AI and ML for observability, distributed
tracing, cost management techniques, and more! Join live to attend the
Q&A [9] 

 PLV8 (WEBSITE) [10] 

 PLV8 is a trusted Javascript language extension for PostgreSQL. It
can be used for stored procedures, triggers, etc. 

 QUARTZ (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your notes as a
website for free. It converts Markdown notes into a fully functional
website. 

 GPU.CPP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 gpu.cpp is a lightweight library that makes portable GPU computation
with C++ simple. It focuses on general purpose native GPU computation,
using the WebGPU specification as a portable low-level GPU interface.
This means developers can drop in GPU code in C++ projects and have it
run on Nvidia, Intel, AMD, and other GPUs, along with a wide variety
of laptops, workstations, mobile devices, and more.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WE NEED VISUAL PROGRAMMING. NO, NOT LIKE THAT (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Visual programming often fails to gain traction among developers
because it focuses on replacing code syntax instead of visualizing
important, implicit aspects of software that developers already
struggle with. Developers already use visual representations like
treemaps, code retention diagrams, network topologies, and memory
layouts to understand and analyze different aspects of their code and
systems. These visualizations can be immensely helpful for tasks like
onboarding in large codebases, diagnosing performance problems,
understanding data layouts, and tracking complex client-server
interactions, so there still is a lot of opportunity here for
startups. 

 UNIVERSAL CODE EXECUTION BY CHAINING MESSAGES IN BROWSER EXTENSIONS
(11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 By chaining various messaging APIs in browsers and browser
extensions, it's possible to achieve 'universal code execution',
breaking Same Origin Policy and browser sandbox. This vulnerability
allows malicious web pages to communicate with an extension's content
script and then relay messages to the background script, which can
further communicate with a native application on the host operating
system. This means that the chain can execute arbitrary code on the
victim's machine. 

 RESPONSIVE BAR CHARTS IN HTML AND CSS (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Using SVG for responsive web visualization can be difficult. This
article presents an alternative hybrid approach that combines HTML,
CSS, and SVG. A grid-based layout with logical properties can be used
to handle bidirectional text and accommodate positive and negative
values.

 GIT-PR (WEBSITE) [16] 

 Git-PR allows you to make patch requests to GitHub repositories over
SSH. 

 THE EXPERIENCE OF DEPLOYING NEXT.JS APPS ON CLOUDFLARE (5 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Deploying Next.js applications on Cloudflare pages is not a seamless
process due to a lack of documentation, inconsistencies with Next.js
conventions, compatibility problems with a Vercel CLI change, issues
with Set-Cookie headers, and challenges with logging and Node.js
compatibility. 

 GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING TO LINK TO SO THEY CAN TALK ABOUT YOUR FEATURES
AND IDEAS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 You should create a dedicated web page that people can easily link to
for definitive information and search engine optimization to promote
discussion about your ideas, projects, and features. 

 GETTING OUT OF HOOK HELL: YOU ARE USING REACT HOOKS THE WRONG WAY (10
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 React Hooks can become unmanageable if overused or misused.
