ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PROMISES FROM THE GROUND UP (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Promises in JavaScript aren't always intuitive to use, but they're
required to be productive with JavaScript. Promises are needed because
JavaScript is single-threaded, which can cause issues when blocking
operations like window.prompt() are used. This post dives into the
mechanics of Promises, their states (pending, fulfilled, and
rejected), and how to work with them using the .then() and .catch()
methods. It also covers creating custom Promises, chaining them
together, passing data between them, and the modern async/await syntax
for a more synchronous-like experience. 

 HOW RUBYGEMS.ORG PROTECTS OUR COMMUNITY'S CRITICAL OSS INFRASTRUCTURE
(4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 RubyGems.org uses a multi-layered security approach including
automated detection, risk scoring, and retroactive scanning to
proactively identify malicious gems, successfully detecting 70-80% of
threats before they're publicly reported. In a recent incident
involving credential-stealing gems discovered by Socket.dev, the
RubyGems security team had already flagged and removed nearly all
malicious packages within days of detection in July. 

 SAY BYE WITH JAVASCRIPT BEACON (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The JavaScript Beacon API provides a reliable way to send data to
servers when users leave a website. This is unlike traditional methods
like XMLHttpRequest or fetch in “beforeunload” events, which often
fail because browsers don't wait for JavaScript execution when
navigating away. The Beacon API works as a "fire-and-forget" mechanism
with a simple syntax (`navigator.sendBeacon()`), allowing the browser
to send the request immediately without waiting for a response, though
it's limited to small amounts of data and only supports POST requests.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO GIVE A GOOD TALK (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Good talks should inform the audience about the work's value, educate
them with portable insights, and entertain them to hold their
attention. It's important to understand the audience's shared values
and frame the work in terms of efficiency and correctness. 

 THE BITTER LESSON IS MISUNDERSTOOD (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Bitter Lesson has been misinterpreted as prioritizing computation
above all else. Scaling laws show that data is equally, if not more,
crucial, as compute power is wasted without sufficient data. AI
progress now depends on either finding ways to wring more value from
existing data through improved model architectures or creating
entirely new data through innovative "alchemical" methods like
self-play. 

 HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU SPEND ON ACCESSIBILITY? (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Digital accessibility should be treated as a core compliance
investment. Companies generally spend 3-10% of annual revenue on
compliance overall, making accessibility investments range from
0.1-0.5% of total revenue for most organizations. The cost of
non-compliance is nearly three times higher than compliance costs,
making proactive accessibility investment both a legal necessity and a
good opportunity to reach over 1 billion people with disabilities
worldwide.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TEAMS ARE ADOPTING AI AT BREAKNECK SPEED - BUT INEFFICIENCIES ARE
GROWING (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Atlassian asked 3,500 developers and managers about their day-to-day
experience - from new tools to ongoing sources of frustration. The
State of Developer Experience 2025 report [10] looks at how developer
teams are working with AI, where friction still exists - and how you
can increase productivity, developer satisfaction, and long-term
success.

Find out:

 	* Why AI adoption is rising, but organizational inefficiencies are
increasing
 	* The biggest productivity drains dev teams face and how to solve
for them
 	* The widening disconnect [10] between leadership expectations and
developers' actual experience
 	* The future of DX and AI

 CLAUDE CODE: NOW IN BETA IN ZED (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Zed has released a beta version of Claude Code integrated directly
into the Zed editor via the new Agent Client Protocol (ACP). This
allows developers to use Claude Code's features like real-time code
editing and custom workflows within the Zed environment. ACP is an
open standard designed to allow any AI agent to connect with Zed and
other compatible editors. 

 AGENTSCOPE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 AgentScope is a framework for building LLM apps with a focus on
agent-oriented programming. It prioritizes transparency, real-time
steering, agentic features like tool management and long-term memory,
and model agnostic design. The framework offers modules for models,
tools, MCP (Model Context Protocol), agents, tracing, memory,
evaluation, and formatting, all highly customizable and modular. 

 REGEXP EQUIVALENCE CHECKER (WEBSITE) [13] 

 This tool checks the equivalence of two JavaScript regular
expressions (excluding global, local, unicode, backreferences,
lookbehind, and word boundary syntax), showing if they match the exact
same strings or providing example strings that demonstrate their
differences.

 AUTOLINKING'S BROKEN PROMISE (23 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Dependency management is complex in Expo and React Native apps,
partly due to the "broken promise" of autolinking to simplify native
module dependencies. Expo SDK 54 has several fixes, including direct
Metro dependencies, removing implicit dependencies, consistent
autolinking, and a CLI fallback resolver, to address these challenges
and support various package managers and monorepos. The updated
autolinking system now discovers transitive dependencies, allowing
`expo-doctor` to proactively report duplicate modules and potential
conflicts for developers to resolve. 

 MIT STUDY FINDS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE USE REPROGRAMS THE BRAIN,
LEADING TO COGNITIVE DECLINE (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A recent MIT study investigated the cognitive effects of using
ChatGPT for essay writing. The study found that students who relied on
ChatGPT experienced weakened brain connectivity, impaired memory
recall, and a diminished sense of authorship. EEG scans revealed
decreased neural activity, especially in areas related to attention
and visual processing.
