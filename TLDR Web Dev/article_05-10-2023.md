YOU DON'T NEED A DEDICATED CACHE SERVICE - POSTGRESQL AS A CACHE (5
MINUTE READ) [https://martinheinz.dev/blog/105?utm_source=tldrwebdev] 

This article explores how to leverage the features of PostgreSQL to
turn it into a fully featured, efficient caching service. By doing so,
you can eliminate the need to operate and manage an additional service
for a single task. While the performance may not match that of
specialized cache services, the extent of performance degradation will
vary based on your data type and usage patterns. The article also
offers a set of queries to assist you in assessing system performance.

RUBY'S NEW TLDR TESTING FRAMEWORK (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2023-10-03-introducing-the-tldr-ruby-test-framework/?utm_source=tldrwebdev]


A new Ruby testing framework called TLDR (not associated with this
newsletter!) enforces a maximum test execution time of 1.8 seconds.
This encourages tests to be run more frequently during development.
The framework aims to provide fast feedback and offers information on
which tests ran, which were canceled, and which tests were too slow to
be run in the 1.8-second test time frame.

HOW TO WRITE BETTER DJANGO CODE (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://klemenstrajhar.substack.com/p/how-to-write-better-django-code?utm_source=tldrwebdev]


This article provides seven tips on writing better Django code with
code examples. Several of these principles and ideas can be applied to
broader software engineering practices, such as the importance of
loosely coupled classes and the preference for unit tests over
integration tests. The article includes Django-specific
recommendations, like avoiding the use of models in direct views or
templates, emphasizing the use of Django form libraries exclusively
for input validation, and the utilization of third-party stubs. 

STRONG STATIC TYPING, A HILL I'M WILLING TO DIE ON... (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.svix.com/blog/strong-typing-hill-to-die-on/?utm_source=tldrwebdev]


While untyped languages have their uses, strong typing is preferable
in almost every case. The advantages include error prevention at
compile-time, which is better than runtime errors. Furthermore, types
can enhance code contracts, improve the development experience,
prevent bugs, and more. This article provides multiple code examples
to make this case.
