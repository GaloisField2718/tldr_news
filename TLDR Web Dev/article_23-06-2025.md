 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SCALING OUR OBSERVABILITY PLATFORM BEYOND 100 PETABYTES BY EMBRACING
WIDE EVENTS AND REPLACING OTEL (32 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ClickHouse scaled its internal observability platform, LogHouse, to
over 100 petabytes by developing SysEx, a specialized system for
ClickHouse-to-ClickHouse data transfers. SysEx, unlike OTel, preserves
native ClickHouse types and removes intermediate conversions,
resulting in a 20x increase in event volume handled with significantly
less CPU usage. They use HyperDX, a ClickHouse-native UI, for seamless
data exploration, correlation, and root-cause analysis, while still
using Grafana for existing dashboards. 

 GIST OF GO: RACE CONDITIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There are different types of race conditions in Go concurrency. This
article goes over how to handle them. It differentiates data races
(concurrent access to shared data with at least one write) from race
conditions (unpredictable order leading to incorrect state), then
explains several approaches to handling race conditions, including
mutexes, compare-and-set operations, and idempotence. 

 GOODBYE UPGRADE FATIGUE — HOW CURSOR UPGRADED OUR STORYBOOK IN JUST
2 HOURS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 HoneyBook engineers used Cursor to upgrade Storybook from v6 to v8 in
just 2 hours, a task that would usually take a developer about a week.
They broke the upgrade into small, manageable tasks with clear success
criteria: first establishing a minimal working Storybook v8 setup with
a dummy story, then systematically migrating individual stories using
Storybook's migration guide as context.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO NEGOTIATE YOUR SALARY PACKAGE (45 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Good salary negotiation involves shifting the mindset to embrace
negotiation as a normal business practice instead of having feelings
of discomfort or moral objection. Don't give a number first. Instead,
thoroughly research and focus on the overall compensation package
beyond just salary. 

 THE STATE OF REACT AND THE COMMUNITY IN 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The React team's push for frameworks, while intended to improve
performance, lacks nuance and has led to confusion and dismissiveness
towards traditional SPA approaches. There also needs to be better
React documentation on Server Components. 

 LEVERED BETA IS ALL YOU NEED (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 "Levered beta" might be a winning strategy in the age of rapidly
improving AI, where being early and loud matters more than building a
superior product. In markets driven by trends and quick advancements
in AI models, companies focused on distribution and claiming mindshare
can thrive, even with mediocre products. These companies are
essentially betting on future AI improvements to validate their early
market entry and aggressive marketing, positioning themselves as the
default choice when the technology finally catches up.

 P-HACKING IN STARTUPS (8 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Startups often fall into p-hacking traps due to pressure for quick
results. Common p-hacking practices include ignoring corrections for
multiple comparisons, shifting metrics after seeing results, and
prematurely stopping experiments. To avoid p-hacking, startups should
pre-register hypotheses, use appropriate corrections, and avoid
peeking at results before the experiment's completion. 

 TPU DEEP DIVE (20 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 This is an in-depth technical overview of Google's Tensor Processing
Units (TPUs). TPUs prioritize scalability and energy efficiency by
using systolic arrays and Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation via the XLA
compiler. The article goes through the TPU architecture from the
single-chip level with its TensorCores and Matrix Multiply Units to
multi-chip configurations, including trays, racks, pods, and multi-pod
setups.
