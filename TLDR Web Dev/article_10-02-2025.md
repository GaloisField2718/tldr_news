ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING AN “EASY” WEB APPLICATION (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This developer spent a long weekend trying to improve a Python
utility by creating a user-friendly, “easy” web app. He first
started using Flask and then a JavaScript-only approach, but the
latter was made difficult by CORS restrictions. This meant he needed
to create a Node.js server and REST API, which added even more
complexity. The final result was made by just reverting to using
Python, leading to a functional, but slightly less user-friendly,
single-file Bottle app with added styling. 

 THE MISTAKES OF CSS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CSS has some inconsistencies and perceived mistakes, such as how
“z-index” doesn't work on all elements. These inconsistencies are
from CSS's rapid changes since it was created, so backwards
compatibility has been challenging. 

 WHICH RICH TEXT EDITOR FRAMEWORK SHOULD YOU CHOOSE IN 2025? (15
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Popular frontend rich text editors include Tiptap, BlockNote,
Lexical, Slate, and Quill. Tiptap is recommended as the most
well-rounded choice, as it's both easy to use and extensible. However,
other editors have their own strengths and tradeoffs. For example,
some editors support realtime collaboration via Yjs, while others
support frameworks other than just React.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ON PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The team at Sentry discovered that true product-market fit is when
customers become passionate advocates who effectively sell the product
for them. Their ideal audience was early-stage, new tech teams who
really needed their solutions, rather than a broader, less engaged
market. 

 WE ARE DESTROYING SOFTWARE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 We are destroying software through a combination of neglecting
complexity, over-reliance on external dependencies, prioritizing speed
over design, and abandoning fundamental software engineering
principles.

 THREE OBSERVATIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Sam Altman believes that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will
build upon previous technological advancements to improve human lives
and potentially solve major global challenges like disease. AI model
intelligence scales predictably with resources, the costs of AI are
decreasing fast, and its socioeconomic value increases
super-exponentially. 

 WHY THE 'SPIRIT' OF OPEN SOURCE MEANS MUCH MORE THAN A LICENSE (6
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 “Open source” is more than just a license. The spirit of open
source is more about community involvement and transparency. Companies
that use open source often don't follow the spirit of it because they
often limit community input.
