ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE REAL FAILURE RATE OF EBS (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Amazon EBS volumes have frequent performance degradations, even
though complete failures and data loss are rare. These "slow" periods,
where volumes operate below their provisioned performance, can cause
application failures and downtime, impacting users. The documented 1%
downtime expectation is significant for real-time workloads and users
can expect at least some downtime if they run enough shards. 

 MAKE UBUNTU PACKAGES 90% FASTER BY REBUILDING THEM (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The standard Ubuntu jq package is slow for processing large GeoJSON
files. Rebuilding jq from source with compiler optimizations and the
mimalloc allocator can improve performance a lot. Preloading mimalloc
dynamically can also give a notable speedup to the standard Ubuntu
binary. 

 HOW NETFLIX STORES 140 MILLION HOURS OF VIEWING DATA PER DAY (16
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Netflix tackled the challenge of storing massive amounts of viewing
data by evolving its time-series data storage system. Initially
relying on Apache Cassandra, its team faced scalability issues with
increasing data volume from video previews and global expansion. They
redesigned its architecture by categorizing data into Full Title
Plays, Video Previews, and Language Preferences, and sharding data by
type and age.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 UNDERRATED SOFT SKILLS: CHARISMA (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Charisma is a learnable skill. In the context of work, it means
focusing on how you make others feel and becoming someone people enjoy
working with. 

 STAMINA IS A QUIET ADVANTAGE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stamina is often associated with physical endurance, but it's also
the ability to consistently uphold values and commitments even when
facing adversity. It's demonstrated through persistent effort in
various aspects of life, like teamwork, problem-solving, and
relationships, despite challenges and exhaustion. Stamina is
cultivated by maintaining focus, patience, and an open mind while
working towards long-term goals, even without immediate progress,
which is valuable when working on long-term projects, like a startup. 

 VERIFICATION-FIRST DEVELOPMENT (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Verification-First Development (VFD) involves establishing a method
of verifying code correctness before writing the code itself, using
tests, type invariants, or formal models. The benefits of VFD include
preventing skipped verification, double-checking verifier
functionality, and detecting errors early. However, VFD can slow down
development, and exert pressure on code design to follow the chosen
verification method.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GEMINI CANVAS - WRITE, CODE, & CREATE IN ONE SPACE WITH AI (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Gemini Canvas is an interactive workspace where users can collaborate
with Gemini to create documents and code, iterate rapidly with
real-time feedback, and share their creations. It's similar to Claude
Artifacts and ChatGPT's Canvas. 

 BUILDING AI AGENTS TO QUERY YOUR SPREADSHEETS AND DATABASES (8 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Query Tables is an AI agent tool that allows users to analyze
structured data from various sources using SQL queries. It can connect
with data sources like Notion, Google Sheets, and enterprise data
warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery. Query Tables maintains a
unified abstraction layer that represents all data sources as tables
with a unique ID, schema, and source URL so data can be joined from
different sources easily. 

 GIT-WHO (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 git-who is a command-line tool that analyzes Git repositories to
determine authorship of code components and subsystems. It provides
three subcommands: `table`, which summarizes contributions by author;
`tree`, which displays a file tree annotated with author information;
and `hist`, which shows a timeline of commit activity. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE WIZ (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Wiz, a cloud
security platform, for $32 billion in cash. This will strengthen
Google Cloud's offerings in cloud security and multicloud
environments. 

 THE MODEL IS THE PRODUCT (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI is evolving towards a model-as-a-product paradigm, where the model
itself, rather than the application layer, becomes the primary source
of value. This shift is driven by the stalling of generalist scaling,
the success of opinionated training, and the plummeting cost of
inference, leading to closed AI model providers moving up the value
chain and disrupting the application layer. Examples include OpenAI's
DeepResearch and Claude 3.7. 

 APPLE RESTRICTS PEBBLE FROM BEING AWESOME WITH IPHONES (5 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Apple imposes many limitations on third-party smartwatches, like
Pebble, which worsens their functionality on iOS compared to Android.
Some restrictions include the inability to send text messages, reply
to notifications, easily integrate with other apps, or create a
third-party app store. These limitations stem from Apple's deliberate
efforts to restrict competition and lock consumers into its ecosystem.

QUICK LINKS

 20 YEARS OF YC (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Hacker News has been an important resource in this developer's
journey from a data analyst with limited technical knowledge to a
confident software engineer. 

 HOW I STAY MOTIVATED WORKING ON MY SOLO SAAS (WHEN IT FEELS LIKE
NOBODY CARES) (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [17] 

 Strategies for staying motivated on a project that lacks user
traction include setting small goals, seeking user feedback, tracking
progress, and taking breaks. 

 MATCHING REGEXPS 200 TIMES FASTER (11 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Thanks to TruffleRuby's advanced JIT compiler and regular expression
engine (TRegex), idiomatic Ruby code using regular expressions can
outperform equivalent C implementations and even hand-written SIMD
code in tasks like JSON string escaping, Time parsing, and integer
scanning. 

 WE'VE JUST WRAPPED UP OUR 3-HOUR DEEP DIVE INTO LYNXJS (3 HOUR VIDEO)
[19] 

 This is a 3-hour deep dive into LynxJS, ByteDance's new JavaScript
framework that already runs at scale in TikTok.
