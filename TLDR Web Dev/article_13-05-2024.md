 üòò KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Traditional QA solutions take years to scale, and high test coverage
is never guaranteed. Consider QA Wolf [4] - a new approach to getting
80% test coverage in just 4 months.
They'll build and maintain your test suite in Playwright (no vendor
lock-in, you own the code) + include unlimited parallel test runs on
their infrastructure. And they guarantee zero flakes [4].

‚úîÔ∏è¬†No more manual e2e testing

‚úîÔ∏è¬†No more QA bottlenecks

‚úîÔ∏è¬†No more bugs reaching your customers

Skeptical? QA Wolf has generated amazing results [5] for companies
like Salesloft, AutoTrader, Mailchimp, and Bubble.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 LESSONS LEARNED REINVENTING THE PYTHON NOTEBOOK (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article goes through Marimo and addresses the shortcomings of
traditional IPython notebooks. It uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
to model dependencies between cells to eliminate hidden state and
guarantee code/output consistency. To be maintainable, the notebook
files are pure Python, making them easy to version, share, and run as
standalone scripts or web applications. 

 THE API DATABASE ARCHITECTURE - STOP WRITING HTTP-GET ENDPOINTS (10
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Instead of writing HTTP GET endpoints manually, it might be better to
use a PostgREST server that directly exposes (with security enabled)
database views and tables. This allows data modification to be handled
by the existing backend. It also allows adjustments of HTTP-GET APIs
through SQL views.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOU DON'T NEED A CSS FRAMEWORK (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CSS frameworks can help in the early stages of development, offering
speed and consistency, but they become difficult to maintain over
time. The alternative is to build your own custom CSS, either from
scratch or using a starter codebase. Modern CSS features make the need
for preprocessors less necessary. 

 THE THREAT TO OPEN SOURCE COMES FROM WITHIN (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The open-source software community is facing threats from both
external and internal sources. While the recent attack on the XZ
library by a state-sponsored actor shows the community is still
strong, internal conflicts arising from licensing disagreements and
accusations of code theft are a more serious threat. These conflicts
are due to competing interests between cloud companies who seek to
profit from OSS and OSS companies seeking sustainable business models.


 PERCEIVED DIFFICULTY IS A PRODUCTIVITY KILLER: HOW TO BUILD FOCUS (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 To overcome the perceived difficulty of new, challenging tasks, block
distractions and break down the problem into smaller achievable goals.
Then, once you've gained momentum, don't stop until you reach a
natural stopping point.

component, and improved accessibility for faster UI development. 

 OMNICLIP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Omniclip is an open-source video-editing application for the web
browser. All videos edited using Omniclip are stored and edited
locally. It features trimming, splitting, rendering, and adding text,
audio, video, and images. 

 JAM.DEV (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Jam is a browser extension that allows you to create a bug report on

 STACK OVERFLOW USERS SABOTAGE THEIR POSTS AFTER OPENAI DEAL (4 MINUTE
READ) [14]

 THE ANATOMY OF A SUCCESSFUL TEAM SQUAD (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Spotify Squad Model has small, cross-functional teams called
squads that are given a lot of autonomy. This author successfully
implemented a hybrid approach, creating temporary squads for specific
projects while maintaining the traditional team structure. For teams
or companies considering using this model, they recommend starting
small or with a specific project and then gauging its effectiveness
from there.
