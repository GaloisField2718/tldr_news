ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 A SEARCH ENGINE IN 80 LINES OF PYTHON (26 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This post walks through how to build a search engine from scratch
using Python. The project was motivated by the desire to address the
"Small Website Discoverability Crisis" and make small websites more
visible. The post walks through the key components of the search
engine, including the crawler, inverted index, ranker, and interface,
providing both theoretical descriptions and practical implementation
details. The project is helpful for deepening one‚Äôs understanding of
search engine mechanisms. 

 PG_ANALYTICS: TRANSFORMING POSTGRES INTO A FAST OLAP DATABASE (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 pg_analytics is a Postgres extension that significantly improves the
analytical performance of Postgres databases by up to 94 times
compared to traditional methods. It addresses the challenges faced by
developers dealing with slow query times and poor data compression,
offering a drop-in solution within Postgres itself. This post explains
the technical workings of pg_analytics, explaining the introduction of
deltalake tables and integration with Apache Arrow and Apache
DataFusion. 

 HOW TO STREAM FILES FROM NEXT.JS ROUTE HANDLERS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 We traditionally use a "public" folder to serve files in Node.js
applications. However, this only works for static assets and doesn‚Äôt
work for files like profile pictures, private files, or generated
files - these files are served from an API and loaded into memory.
This isn‚Äôt scalable when there are a lot of users. Instead, it‚Äôs
useful to use a stream to return large files in chunks. This article
looks at a couple of ways to achieve this using both Next.js API
routes and also the more generic Route handlers.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO GET IN THE FLOW WHILE CODING (AND WHY IT‚ÄôS IMPORTANT) (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many developers have experienced ‚Äúflow state‚Äù: your ideas are
flowing, time and space fade away, and the path ahead of you is clear.
Achieving flow state is not only great for productivity, but also
enhances dopamine and endorphins, resulting in an increased feeling of
motivation, thinking ability, and general well-being. To better reach
flow state, it‚Äôs helpful to optimize your environment, map out your
work ahead of time, and find joy in the work that you‚Äôre doing. 

 WHEN "LETTING IT CRASH" IS NOT ENOUGH (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Once your app gets into an undesirable state, the best thing you can
do is reset it and start from a fresh, well-known, and correct state.
Erlang‚Äôs "let it crash" philosophy suggests resetting parts of an
application upon failure. While effective, it requires developers to
manually track and restore application states. Another approach,
"durable execution," allows computation to run uninterrupted by
storing minimal data for state reconstruction, making local variables
resilient even through restarts. 

 ‚ÄúWHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS‚Äù IS A RADICAL STATEMENT (5 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The phrase "wherever you find podcasts‚Äù highlights a stark contrast
between podcasting and closed media platforms like YouTube or TikTok.
Podcasting's open format empowers creators to control their content
and audience relationships, enabling portability and resisting
surveillance-based advertising. There are challenges in podcast
economics, but podcasting is a beacon for the open web's renaissance
and a model for reclaiming control in online spaces. Podcasting is
similar to RSS feeds for blogs and newsletters.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SQLITE WEB (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 SQLite Web is a web-based SQLite database browser written in Python.
It lets developers add, drop, or edit tables, columns, rows, and
indexes. SQLite Web works with both existing SQLite databases or can
be used to create new ones. It allows for the import and export of
both JSON and CSV files. 

 CONCRETE.CSS (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Concrete.css is a simple, classless CSS framework. It offers styling
for typography, sections, buttons, images, lists, forms, tables,
blockquotes, and progress bars. 

 MEOW (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Meow is a CLI app helper. It can parse arguments, convert flags to
camel case, negate flags with ‚Äú--no-‚Äù prefixes, and output helpful
descriptions and help text. Meow has no dependencies.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAYMENTS STARTUPS (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While working at startups and moving fast, it‚Äôs important to use
existing tools before adding new ones to avoid complexity. Software
often changes fast at startups, so optimize software for change and
focus on iteration, testing, and implementing a modular monolith
approach. Store data in databases for easy querying, utilize decision
logs, and employ continuous deployment practices for efficient
software delivery. 

 THE IDEAL PR IS 50 LINES LONG (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The ideal size for small pull requests (PRs) is around 50 lines long.
Smaller PRs are reviewed and merged faster, less likely to be
reverted, and attract more review comments per line changed. Data from
various repositories suggests that PRs between 25-100 lines offer
optimal benefits across speed, review quality, and total code output.
Extremely small PRs (under 25 lines) tend to have a higher revert
rate, while very large PRs (over 10,000 lines) may receive less
engagement and feedback. 

 NEW LOCALLLM LETS YOU DEVELOP GEN AI APPS LOCALLY, WITHOUT GPUS (6
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Google Cloud‚Äôs localllm enables developers to utilize LLMs on local
CPUs without GPUs. Developers can use quantized models and Cloud
Workstations for cheaper LLM usage and better privacy controls
compared to online models like GPT-4.

 REACT RESIZABLE PANELS (WEBSITE) [19] 

 React components for resizable panels, supporting horizontal,
vertical, and persistent layouts.
