 10 BEST PRACTICES IN FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article covers best practices in front-end development, with
code examples for each practice described. The practices described
include improving code organization by using export barrels, named
exports, absolute paths, proper file naming, and separating logic when
possible. Other general best practices include distinguishing hooks
from utility functions, using custom hooks for logic reusability, and
applying proper linting to the code base. 

 WRITING A FILE SYSTEM FROM SCRATCH IN RUST (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article explains the fundamental concepts of file systems and
their organization by using Rust code examples. By going through the
process of writing a file system from scratch, it covers topics such
as structuring the disk, including superblocks, bitmaps, inodes, and
data blocks. The article also demonstrates how file systems handle
large files using various levels of pointers and how directory
structures are implemented.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY KUBERNETES NEEDS AN LTS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Managing and upgrading Kubernetes (k8s) clusters is challenging due
to the rapid release cycle and complexity of the platform. An LTS
(Long-Term Support) release of Kubernetes with a 24-month support
period, where organizations would migrate to new clusters after the
LTS period ends, would allow organizations to safely plan for upgrades
and cause less headaches overall. 

 HOW TO GROW FROM SENIOR TO A LEAD ROLE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 As engineers, we are used to having things in our control, where the

Tech leads become force multipliers for the team by helping others be
more productive. The post gives tips on how you grow to be a
successful team leader and includes general advice on being a
go-to-engineer.

 HOW WE ENHANCED OUR TEAM'S DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A company was able to greatly improve its developer experience with a
few infrastructure changes. The changes resulted in reducing the time
to receive CI (Continuous Integration) feedback from over twenty
minutes to less than three minutes, with a 75% reduction in local test
execution time. It did this by reorganizing the GitHub workflows by
separating concerns, reusing Docker test containers, and sharding
tests for parallel execution. 

 HOW MARKETING CHANGED OOP IN JAVASCRIPT (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article discusses the decisions surrounding JavaScript
prototypes, examines missteps in the design, and explores how these
factors have affected the way we write JavaScript today. One key
takeaway is that many developers believe JavaScript has true classes,
even though a class in JavaScript is no different from any other
function object. JavaScript is not truly object-oriented in the way a
language like Java is.
