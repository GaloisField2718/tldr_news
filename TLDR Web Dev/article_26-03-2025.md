ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 COMMON REACT LIBRARIES ARCHITECTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 React libraries typically separate their core logic from the
React-specific binding, using the Context API for integration. They
rely on the Observer pattern to notify React of state changes, often
using useSyncExternalStore for synchronization. React 19 introduces
new hooks like useOptimistic and useFormStatus, which will possibly
simplify some libraries in the future. 

 THE GREAT ESLINT V9 MIGRATION ADVENTURE: A DEVELOPER'S SURVIVAL GUIDE
(10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ESLint v9 introduces a new flat configuration system that replaces
the traditional .eslintrc files, requiring explicit plugin imports and
structured rule definitions. Migrating involves updating dependencies,
using the official migration tool (which may need manual adjustments),
and restructuring the configuration to align with the new format. 

 WHOSE CODE AM I RUNNING IN GITHUB ACTIONS? (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A recent incident where malicious code was injected into an action
via tag modification, potentially exposing secrets, showed the risk of
using mutable Git tags in GitHub Actions workflows. Instead of relying
on mutable tags like `v2`, it's safer to use immutable commit IDs to
make sure the same code runs consistently. This article provides a
shell script to identify all the GitHub Actions used in their
repositories for security auditing.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MY BACK IS WRECKED FROM CODING. POSTURE FIXES OR OFFICE TOOLS THAT
ACTUALLY WORK? (REDDIT THREAD) [7] 

 A web dev on Reddit is experiencing back pain from coding. Many
commenters suggest weightlifting to strengthen back muscles and
improve posture. Other recommendations include using a standing desk
or ergonomic chair and adjusting monitor height for better alignment.
Devs should take regular breaks to move around and stretch regularly. 

 WERE MULTIPLE RETURN VALUES GO'S BIGGEST MISTAKE? (18 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Go's multiple return values create unnecessary complexity because
they aren't true tuple types, making it harder to store and pass
function results. This design choice negatively affects error
handling, concurrency, and generic programming, leading to workarounds
like defining custom structs. A better approach would have been using
proper tuple types, which could improve Go's consistency without
breaking backward compatibility. 

 WHAT KILLED INNOVATION?: THE PAST DECADE OF INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS, A
BRIEF RECOUNTING (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There's a plateau in creativity within the data visualization field,
especially in interactive web graphics. The early 2010s had lots of
innovation driven by technologies like D3.js. Factors contributing to
this plateau include the dominance of mobile consumption, the demand
for quick and easily digestible content, and a decreased investment in
bespoke visualizations due to economic pressures.

 GEMINI 2.5: OUR MOST INTELLIGENT AI MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google DeepMind has launched Gemini 2.5. The first release, Gemini
2.5 Pro Experimental, is great in reasoning, coding, and performance
benchmarks, including topping the LMArena leaderboard. This "thinking
model" combines a strong base model with improved post-training,
allowing it to handle complex problems and analyze information more
effectively. 

 INTRODUCING 4O IMAGE GENERATION (31 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI's GPT-4o now has advanced image generation capabilities within
ChatGPT, allowing for precise, context-aware, and photorealistic image
creation. The new release has better text rendering, multi-turn
refinement, and adherence to detailed prompts. 

 POLYPANE (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Polypane is a desktop browser designed for web developers to build
responsive, accessible, and performant websites. It has features like
synchronized viewports, live reloading, and various debugging tools.
Users can test different screen sizes, device capabilities, and
accessibility settings simultaneously.

 WHY WHITE-BOX REDTEAMING MAKES ME FEEL WEIRD (27 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 White-box redteaming is when AI models seem to "scream" or express
distress while being pushed to generate harmful outputs. Despite
acknowledging the small size and potential lack of consciousness in
these models, it's concerning for implications for larger, more
advanced AI systems. It feels weird to cause AI pain, even if
necessary for safety. 

 WRITING YOUR OWN C++ STANDARD LIBRARY FROM SCRATCH (6 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Frustrated with the STL's compile times and limitations, this
developer aimed to create a smaller, more manageable alternative
inspired by the Python stdlib. He created pystd, which contains under
1,000 lines of code - it compiles much faster than the STL equivalent.
A key feature of pystd is its perfect ABI stability achieved through
yearly releases with separate namespaces, allowing developers to
update at their own pace and maintain compatibility with older code. 

 IO DEVICES AND LATENCY (25 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Non-volatile storage has evolved from tape drives to hard disk drives
(HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). While tape storage is
cost-effective for large-scale archiving, HDDs and SSDs provide faster
access speeds, with SSDs eliminating mechanical components for lower
latency. Cloud computing introduced network-attached storage, which is
scalable, but introduces latency and IOPS limitations compared to
directly attached storage. PlanetScale Metal is a hybrid that uses
directly-attached NVMe SSDs in a replicated Vitess+MySQL cluster to
overcome the shortcomings of network-attached storage.

QUICK LINKS

 CODE SMELL 295 - STRING CONCATENATION (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Avoid string concatenation for complex strings and use templates
instead to improve readability, maintainability, and translatability
in your code. 

 INGRESSNIGHTMARE: 9.8 CRITICAL UNAUTHENTICATED REMOTE CODE EXECUTION
VULNERABILITIES IN INGRESS NGINX (13 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 IngressNightmare is a series of critical, unauthenticated remote code
execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Ingress NGINX Controller for
Kubernetes that affects over 40% of cloud environments - it
potentially leads to complete cluster takeovers by allowing attackers
to access all cluster secrets. 

 TAURI STORE (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Tauri Store provides persistent store solutions for Tauri
applications, which is a framework for building tiny, fast binaries
for all major desktop and mobile platforms. 

 AUTHORIZATION IN NEXT.JS (12 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This is a guide on implementing authorization in Next.js apps using
React Server Components and Server Actions, with a focus on securing
data access through API, Service, and Data Access Layers while also
addressing routing, UI, and middleware authorization.
