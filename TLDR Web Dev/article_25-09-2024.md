ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REDESIGN CASE STUDY 2024 (19 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This article goes over a complete frontend redesign of a website that
involved creating a new header, a unique hero section featuring
personalized hats drawn by the author's daughter, and a circular
navigation for the hats section. It also incorporated interactive
elements using Framer Motion and scroll-driven animations, along with
the usage of CSS features like container queries, :has(), offset-path,
and more. 

 POSTGRES WRITE-AHEAD LOGS (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Postgres Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) are needed for logical replication in
Postgres. WAL works by storing each state change as a command in an
append-only file before the change is actually made to the database,
allowing for recovery from the last checkpoint in case of a crash. WAL
offers various configurable parameters like `wal_level`, `fsync`,
`wal_buffers`, and `checkpoint_flush_after` to optimize performance
and control data retention. 

 WHAT I'VE LEARNED IN THE PAST YEAR SPENT BUILDING AN AI VIDEO EDITOR
(13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This developer, while building a generative video platform, used
Microsoft Promptflow and Temporal to build generative workflows but
encountered some challenges with unpredictable LLMs and embeddings. He
found that embeddings might not be the best solution for every search
problem and traditional search methods may be needed in some cases.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MOVE FAST AND ABANDON THINGS (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This former Mac game developer reflects on his experience of rapid
prototyping and abandoning unfinished projects, arguing that this
approach, while seemingly chaotic, was ultimately effective for him.
He quickly tested game ideas as it allowed for the identification of
truly compelling concepts. This "move fast and abandon things"
philosophy was applicable even in his later career as a software
engineer at Apple, where he found himself a "blue-collar" programmer
amidst "white-collar" professionals. 

 WHAT I TELL PEOPLE NEW TO ON-CALL (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 New on-call engineers should not fix every issue personally, but
rather assess the situation and ensure it's addressed. They should
also shadow experienced engineers to learn best practices and
prioritize their well-being by not sacrificing personal health for
non-critical issues. 

 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOPICS I'VE CHANGED MY MIND ON AFTER 6 YEARS IN
THE INDUSTRY (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 After six years in the industry, this developer now values typed
languages for team collaboration, sees standups as helpful for
onboarding, and believes sprint retrospectives are valuable when
focused on actual course correction. Software architecture is more
important than he once thought and practicality is always better than
dogmatically adhering ‚Äúbest practices.‚Äù

infrastructure for specific use cases.
