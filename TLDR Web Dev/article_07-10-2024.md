 AN ENGINEER'S CHECKLIST OF LOGGING BEST PRACTICES (8 MINUTE READ) [4]


 Logs should be treated as data for analysis in order to make them
both useful and actionable. In software systems, logs should be
structured, have unique identifiers, and be part of a centralized
logging system. 

 YES, YOU SHOULD USE SQLITE: NOTION'S CREATIVE SQLITE USAGE FOR 20%
FASTER LOADS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Notion implemented WebAssembly (WASM) SQLite in its web app. This
resulted in a 20% reduction in page navigation latency. To achieve
this, its team used Web Workers to offload database operations to
background threads and a SharedWorker with the Web Locks API to fix
data integrity issues. They also addressed issues of slow disk reads
by implementing a "race" between disk cache and network requests. 

 UNLEASH JAVASCRIPT'S POTENTIAL WITH FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING (37 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Functional programming (FP) is the process of composing functions to
create software rather than just executing statements. This article
goes through JavaScript's data types, functions, and methods and
introduces FP techniques, including closures, higher-order functions
(map, filter, and reduce), and function composition.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 RUST NEEDS AN EXTENDED STANDARD LIBRARY (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Rust's ecosystem is plagued by fragmentation, with a constant influx
of new libraries and frameworks. This fragmentation has led to
security concerns as developers are forced to rely on numerous
third-party libraries. The proposed solution is an extended standard
library, "stdx," providing core functionalities like cryptography,
networking, and data handling. 

 WE DON'T TEST (REDDIT THREAD) [8] 

 A Reddit user's company's development process involves developers
writing and manually testing code because developers are pressured to
move on to new tasks constantly. This results in frequent bugs being
found in production, leading to blame placed on developers for not
testing enough. Advice is given by other Reddit users on how to
emphasize testing more, such as making a business case for proper
testing to management. 

 THE CASE AGAINST DOCUMENTING CODE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Excessive code documentation can be inefficient, as it requires time
and effort to create and maintain, often leading to outdated and
irrelevant information. Instead, in-line documentation within code
itself should be preferred, and it's possible that LLMs could make
documentation much easier to maintain in the future.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ONE (WEBSITE) [10] 

 One is a new React framework designed to simplify web and native app
development, built on Vite and offering universal, typed routing. It
works with Zero, a client-side database solution. Zero provides data
storage and syncing, allowing for small bundle sizes and offline-first
capabilities. 

 LIVEKIT AGENTS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 The LiveKit Agents framework is a Python library that allows
developers to build real-time AI-driven server programs that can
interact with users through text, audio, images, and video. This is
the package that OpenAI uses to power its Advanced Voice feature. A
JavaScript version of the library is also available. 

 ESLINT NOW OFFICIALLY SUPPORTS LINTING OF JSON AND MARKDOWN (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 ESLint has expanded its capabilities to include linting of JSON and
Markdown files. To do so, there are new plugins (@eslint/json and
@eslint/markdown) that can be used.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PATENT TROLL SABLE PAYS UP, DEDICATES ALL ITS PATENTS TO THE PUBLIC!
(9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cloudflare won a patent infringement lawsuit against Sable, a patent
troll who asserted patents relating to old hardware-based router
technologies against Cloudflare's modern software-defined services. A
jury found that Cloudflare did not infringe Sable's patent and that
the asserted patent claim is invalid. Sable agreed to pay Cloudflare
$225,000, grant Cloudflare a royalty-free license to its entire patent
portfolio, and dedicate its patents to the public. 

 PLAYING WITH BOLT AND POSTGRES (15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 BOLT is a binary optimization tool from LLVM that improves PostgreSQL
performance. It can significantly increase performance, sometimes by
30-40%, but the effectiveness depends greatly on the profile used to
guide the optimization. While BOLT itself may not be directly
implemented in PostgreSQL, the learnings from the experiment could
help future code and build adjustments generate more efficient
executables.

QUICK LINKS

 CARTOGRAPHIST (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Cartographist is an experimental web browser that encourages
rabbit-holing by using horizontally scrollable panes and a
tree-structured outline of browsing history that allows for saving and
loading "trails" of research sessions. 

 CODEAIR (WEBSITE) [16] 

 CodeAir is a smartphone-based remote control for VS Code that allows
users to transfer files, images, and code between their devices and VS
Code, control VS Code instances using voice commands and text, and use
AI features for code generation and file analysis. 

 SOMETIMES THE PRODUCT INNOVATION IS THE DISTRIBUTION (6 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Product innovation often comes from finding novel ways to distribute
existing products rather than solely focusing on changing the product
itself. 

 META MOVIE GEN (WEBSITE) [18] 

 Meta has released Movie Gen, which uses AI to generate high-quality
videos, edit existing ones, and create personalized videos from text
inputs.
