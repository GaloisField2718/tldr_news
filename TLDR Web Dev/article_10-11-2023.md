 HOW TO DO A TYPESCRIPT CONVERSION (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article addresses two popular approaches to converting a
JavaScript-based application to TypeScript: do it as you go, or
convert the code base in a ‚Äúleaves-first‚Äù order where no module is
converted without first having types for all of its dependencies. Most
developers tend to take the first approach, However, there are two
major problems with this. First, you will end up having to propagate
changes to various files over and over and over again. Second, you
cannot rely on the things you have already converted to actually be
safe when taking this approach. The rigorous approach is harder but is
a better option. 

 A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO ANGULAR‚ÄôS DEFER BLOCK (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Angular v17 introduces a powerful feature called the "defer block"
designed to improve performance and optimize component loading.
Components, directives, or pipes placed within a defer block are
loaded based on specific conditions or events, allowing for lazy
loading. Defer blocks can be enhanced with @loading, @placeholder, and
@error blocks for a more comprehensive user experience. This article
uses code examples to explain the many ways defer blocks can be used.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT I LEARNED GETTING ACQUIRED BY GOOGLE (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Socratic was an educational app that was purchased by Google in 2018.
In this post, the founder of Socratic shares his lessons from getting
acquired, many of which focus on what Google‚Äôs software engineering
culture is like compared to that of a startup. For example, even at
Google‚Äôs scale, most Google Search improvements are still manually
reviewed on spreadsheets through a side-by-side comparison. 

 HOW TO BURNOUT A SOFTWARE ENGINEER, IN 3 EASY STEPS (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Burnout doesn't necessarily result from excessive working hours. This
article shares two personal experiences of burnout, one at a startup
and another at a large tech corporation. Both cases were triggered by
factors such as micromanagement, a lack of trust in engineering teams,
the implementation of unnecessary processes, delays in delivering code
to customers, and overcommitting. The article offers valuable insights
on how software engineers can effectively manage and address burnout. 

 TYPING FAST IS ABOUT LATENCY, NOT THROUGHPUT (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While professional developers may only need to produce a limited
amount of text or code per week, fast typing offers advantages in
terms of quickly iterating, restructuring, and maintaining a flow of
thoughts. The ability to type quickly allows for more efficient
exploration of different sentence structures in writing and better
organization of code thoughts. Even small improvements in typing speed
can significantly reduce the "pause in thoughts" during the writing
process, leading to increased productivity and a smoother workflow.

 WATCH NOW: _RUBY ON RAILS - THE DOCUMENTARY_ (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Love it or hate it, you probably have opinions about Ruby on Rails
and its creator, David Heinemeier Hansson. How did Rails come to be,
almost 20 years ago? A new documentary [10] by Honeypot [11] tells the
full story behind Ruby on Rails through interviews with Jamis Buck,
Jeremy Daer, Jason Fried, Tobias L√ºtke, and... DHH.

 ASKED TO DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL AT WORK? HERE‚ÄôS WHAT THESE SOFTWARE
ENGINEERS DID (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This post discusses three real-life cases where engineers and
engineering managers faced ethical dilemmas in their workplaces. At
FTX, engineering director Nishad Singh discovered potential fraud but
chose to stay and attempt to resolve it, resulting in legal
consequences. In contrast, an engineer refused to fabricate user data
and faced no legal consequences at a startup called Frank. A
deliberate double charging incident occurred at Pollen and the
engineer involved expressed regret for their actions. 

 DON‚ÄôT BUILD AI PRODUCTS THE WAY EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING IT (11
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This blog discusses ways you can build differentiated AI apps that
deal with the problematic sides of LLM such as its cost, slowness, and
lack of customization. The solution is to build your own toolchain of
models connected by normal code. The trick is, as strange as it
sounds, to avoid using AI for as long as possible in your project.
Then, when you start finding particular problems that standard coding
doesn't solve well ‚Äî but well-established AI models can ‚Äî start
generating your own data and training your own models with a wide
variety of tools you can find off-the-shelf. 

 HOW WE ORGANIZE OUR VERY LARGE PYTHON MONOLITH (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article covers how Kraken Technologies organizes its large
Python monolith, consisting of around 28,000 Python modules. Kraken
implemented a layered architecture pattern to prevent code complexity
and enforce clear dependencies. The top-level modules and subpackages
serve as layers, ensuring that components do not depend on those
higher up in the stack. This structure is maintained using a linter
that enforces layering and independence rules.

 INTERNAL AUTOMATTIC MEMO (THREADS POST) [17] 

 An internal Automattic memo is making the rounds on Tumblr,
indicating that the company has failed to get Tumblr activity/revenue
up since its 2019 acquisition. It will now be maintained by a skeleton
crew of Trust & Safety and support folks. 

 VIMGPT (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 GPT-4 is given the ability to browse the web on its own. 

 SINGLETON CLASSES WITH TYPESCRIPT (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The Singleton design pattern ensures that there is only a single
instance of a class in an application. This article teaches how to
create a singleton class in TypeScript.
