the "useWebSocket" hook, managing the connection in the top-level
component, using the Context API, or creating a custom hook.

 IS IT WISE TO TURN YOUR BEST PROGRAMMERS INTO MANAGERS? (3 MINUTE

crucial role in shaping strategic and executive decisions within a
company and their technical expertise should be valued as much as
other disciplines in management.

 I ACCIDENTALLY SAVED HALF A MILLION DOLLARS (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 An employee saved their company half a million dollars in a few

consultants, resulting in a chaotic and inefficient analytics
platform. Despite the employee‚Äôs efforts, the organization seemed
more interested in maintaining the illusion of competence rather than
acknowledging its operational shortcomings.
