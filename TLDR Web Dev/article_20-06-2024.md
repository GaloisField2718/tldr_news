ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REACT 19 AND SUSPENSE - A DRAMA IN 3 ACTS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 React 19 RC had changes to its Suspense behavior that caused concerns
about performance. The React community's feedback led to a heated
discussion, so the React team decided to delay the release to address
issues. 

 CODE MODELS (40 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Code reflection in Java allows developers to access and manipulate
symbolic representations of Java code called code models. Code models
are structured as trees, with nodes representing elements like
operations, bodies, and blocks. They are stored in Static Single
Assignment (SSA) form. Code models are used for things like generating
derived code and optimizing existing code. 

 INLINE CONDITIONALS IN CSS? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The CSS Working Group is adding an if() function to CSS that will
allow developers to use conditional logic directly within CSS styles.
This makes it easier to apply dynamic styles based on custom
properties, media queries, or feature support.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I WILL PILEDRIVE YOU IF YOU MENTION AI AGAIN (24 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This data scientist is frustrated with the current AI hype,
particularly from those who lack understanding of the technology. He
believes most companies should prioritize improving their operations
and culture rather than blindly adopting AI. While AI has potential,
most companies lack the expertise and infrastructure to utilize it
effectively. 

 ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE ANTI-PATTERNS AND SMELLS (8 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Enterprise architecture often suffers from common anti-patterns like
blindly adopting trends from large tech companies, becoming too
detached from daily development, or being seen solely as a career
advancement for engineers. These can lead to misaligned initiatives,
irrelevant solutions, and a lack of trust between architects and
development teams. A successful architecture practice requires
striking a balance between up-front design and agile iteration.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING VERCEL AI SDK 3.2 (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vercel AI SDK 3.2 introduces new features like agent workflows for
complex tasks, new model providers, embedding support for semantic
search, and improvements in observability and client-side tool calls. 

 HTMX 2.0 IS RELEASED (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 htmx 2.0.0 has been released. It features changes like the removal of
Internet Explorer support and migration of extensions to a separate
repository. There are changes to the default settings. 

 API FIDDLE (WEBSITE) [13] 

 API Fiddle is a playground for REST(ish) APIs. It allows users to
design endpoints and specifications for technical documents.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY YOUR SSD (PROBABLY) SUCKS AND WHAT YOUR DATABASE CAN DO ABOUT IT
(8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 SSDs have a fast read and write throughput, but also suffer from high
latency during write operations. To mitigate this issue, database
systems use techniques like group commits and asynchronous processing.
Enterprise-grade SSDs with capacitor-backed write caches can alleviate
the latency problem, but at a higher cost. 

 UX/UI-TRENDS IN 2024 (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This blog post discusses UI/UX trends in 2024, including the use of
3D graphics, complex gradients, 2D illustrations, minimalism, dark
interfaces, animations, and characters. Aesthetics should be balanced
with user needs, but users are increasingly looking for better-looking
designs in today's web apps, especially for consumer-facing ones.

QUICK LINKS

 WHY DOES SQLITE (IN PRODUCTION) HAVE SUCH A BAD REP? (2 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 SQLite often gets a bad reputation for production use due to its
limitations in handling concurrent writes and its historical lack of
backup and replication features, but recent improvements like WAL mode
and Litestream have addressed some of these concerns. 

 HOW TO USE GIT REFLOG TO FIND LOST COMMITS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 ‚ÄòGit reflog' can be used to recover lost commits in Git since Git
reflog is an audit log of everything that you do (to the HEAD
reference). 

 PROGRAMMING MANTRAS ARE PROVERBS (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Programming mantras should be treated as proverbs, offering guidance
rather than strict rules, and should be applied with careful
consideration of the context. 

 RELAY VERSION 17.0.0 (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Version 17.0.0 of Relay (a JavaScript framework for building
data-driven React applications by Meta) contains enhanced schema
validation and edge type validation, alongside significant performance
optimizations and expanded editor integration features.
