ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW THE GOOGLE CLOUD OUTAGE CRASHED THE INTERNET (11 MINUTE READ) [5]


 A Google Cloud Platform outage caused widespread internet disruptions
impacting services like Spotify, Snapchat, and Google Workspace on
June 12. The root cause was a bug in the Service Control system
triggered by a malformed policy update that cascaded globally due to
rapid data replication. Google's response included a "red-button" kill
switch to disable the faulty code, but recovery was hampered by a herd
effect in the us-central1 region and a communication breakdown due to
the Cloud Service Health dashboard being affected. 

 TALES FROM THE TRENCH: BUILDING WITH LLMS AND HONEYCOMB (24 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Claude was tasked with creating a chatbot app from scratch with an
emphasis on testing, CI/CD, and observability. It was great at
bootstrapping the project and setting up infrastructure, but weak in
code migration and generating working code in one attempt.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE INGREDIENTS OF A PRODUCTIVE MONOREPO (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A productive monorepo needs custom tooling to address challenges that
arise as the repository grows. Instead of blindly copying solutions
from large tech companies like Google and Meta, it's important to
prioritize an organization's specific needs and values. A key
principle is to make sure that operations on the repository are
O(change) rather than O(repo) for the best performance. 

 PITFALLS OF PREMATURE CLOSURE WITH LLM ASSISTED CODING (9 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 While AI is great at menial tasks, its tendency to offer a single,
seemingly perfect solution for complex problems can lead to technical
debt and downplay problem-solving skills. Devs need to review
AI-generated code critically and think about alternative solutions
too. 

 WHAT GOOGLE TRANSLATE CAN TELL US ABOUT VIBECODING (6 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Google Translate is a good analogy to use when discussing the impact
of LLMs on computer programming. While some predict the end of
programming due to AI tools, LLMs are more like advanced translation
tools that augment, rather than replace, human expertise. Translators
and interpreters still thrive by providing context and navigating
ambiguity.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WE'RE EXPANDING OUR GEMINI 2.5 FAMILY OF MODELS (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google is expanding its Gemini 2.5 model family with the general
availability of 2.5 Flash and Pro, as well as the introduction of 2.5
Flash-Lite, a faster and more cost-efficient model. 

 GENKIT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Genkit is an open-source framework from Firebase that makes the
development, integration, testing, and deployment of AI-powered apps
across multiple languages and platforms easier. It provides a unified
interface to various AI models and streamlines AI development
workflows. 

 FIREBASE STUDIO (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Firebase Studio is a full-stack AI workspace that speeds up app
development by using AI agents for backend, frontend, and mobile apps.
It allows devs to quickly build by importing existing repositories or
using AI tools like App Prototyping and Gemini Code Assist. It also
has easy deployment to Firebase App Hosting.

 HOW JPEG BECAME THE INTERNET'S IMAGE STANDARD (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 For three decades, JPEG has been the dominant image format on the
internet. Unlike the GIF, the JPEG document standard was built
collaboratively, leading to its widespread adoption. Its compression
method, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), is what allows it to be so
efficient. 

 O3 TURNS PRO (21 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 o3-Pro is a new, slower, and slightly better version of o3 that uses
much more compute for complex problems. While it often delivers
improved results, its slowness can disrupt workflows, making it
comparable to Deep Research in terms of waiting time. 

 AI WILL SHRINK AMAZON'S WORKFORCE IN THE COMING YEARS, CEO JASSY SAYS
(4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sees a reduction in the company's corporate
workforce in the future due to the increasing adoption of generative
AI tools. Employees will adapt by learning how to utilize AI to
improve efficiency and work with smaller teams.
