 2023 JAVASCRIPT RISING STARS (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The JavaScript Rising Stars is an annual report that highlights
popular projects and trends in the JavaScript ecosystem. In 2023,
projects like shadcn/ui, Bun, Excalidraw, and Next.js were very
prominent. React continues to be the most-used front-end framework,
while HTMX and Svelte are growing as popular alternatives. The report
also covers developments in build tools, mobile development,
styling/CSS in JS, testing, desktop applications, static sites, state
management, and GraphQL. 

 NEXT.JS 14 INTERCEPTING ROUTES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Next.js 14‚Äôs App Router introduced intercepting routes, which
allows users to intercept or stop the default routing behavior and
present an alternate view or component when navigating through the UI
while still preserving the intended route for scenarios like page
reloads. This can be useful if you want to show a route while keeping
the context of the current page. This post provides practical examples
of when intercepting routes can be used to improve your website‚Äôs
UX. 

 MAKING SENSE OF ‚ÄúSENSELESS‚Äù JAVASCRIPT FEATURES (14 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 This article discusses "senseless" JavaScript features, such as the
floating-point format and why 0.1 + 0.2 doesn't equal 0.3, type
coercion and why using === is preferred over ==, automatic semicolon
insertion and its limitations, the presence of two bottom values (null
and undefined), and the use of increment (++) and decrement (--)
operators. These quirks are important to understand as they can lead
to hard-to-debug issues. By avoiding certain constructs as shown by
examples in the article, developers can make their code more readable.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 9 YEARS OF APPLE TEXT EDITOR SOLO DEV (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This solo developer has been working on a text editor for nine years,
building the application using AppKit and Objective-C. In this post,
they describe various implementation details and challenges
experienced while developing the application, such as the
application‚Äôs architecture, the decision to avoid third-party
dependencies, and how storyboards were used to create a
well-structured codebase. They also show how they read framework code
and analyze stack traces to understand how Apple frameworks work. 

 WEIRD THINGS ENGINEERS BELIEVE ABOUT WEB DEVELOPMENT (15 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 The web development community has common assumptions that are not
always true. For example, the engineers that create web browsers do
not necessarily know how to develop web applications well. Another
common belief is that all sites should work without JavaScript. While
this is an admirable goal, some sites should actually use more
JavaScript. Generally, using JavaScript well leads to better user
experiences on the web. 

 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REFACTORING (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 It‚Äôs helpful to have a comprehensive suite of tests to make
refactoring easier. Take small steps when making changes, run tests
frequently, adopt continuous integration, refrain from adding extra
functionality during refactoring, and make refactoring an integral
part of the development process. Automate refactoring when possible
and avoid excessively long functions or classes.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 QUICK-LINT-JS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Quick-lint-js finds bugs in JavaScript programs, such as syntax
errors, using await in a non-async function, and assigning to a const
variable. 

 BETTER COMMITS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Better Commits is a CLI tool that lets developers generate
conventional commits through a series of prompts. This allows for
better commit messages while inferring ticket and commit type from the
branch for consistency.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ANGULAR DEVELOPER SURVEY 2023 (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Angular developer survey for 2023 found that 96% of developers
use the latest standalone APIs, with 26% already using Signals.
Developers appreciate Angular for its integration between core
modules, runtime performance, and dependency injection, but identified
areas for improvement in its documentation, component authoring
format, and initial load performance. The roadmap for 2024 includes
continued work on documentation, improving initial load times, and
enhancing the component authoring experience. 

 ESCAPING THE COST/VISIBILITY TRADEOFF IN OBSERVABILITY PLATFORMS (7
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 It‚Äôs difficult to keep costs low as system complexity grows in
traditional Application Performance Monitoring systems. This leads to
a cost/visibility tradeoff, where to cut costs, teams have to cut down
on visibility into their application‚Äôs performance. There are
several options to address this, such as focusing on efficient event
handling, embedding custom attribute tracking in code, and using
open-source observability tools. 

 REACT NATIVE'S 2023 HIGHLIGHTS AND 2024 OUTLOOK INTRO (4 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 React Native saw significant improvements in 2023, including
first-class TypeScript support, better styling and layout using
Flexbox, and new features like Bridgeless mode. React Native receives
updates often, has active community support, and has a growing
presence in the top 100 apps on mobile app stores.
