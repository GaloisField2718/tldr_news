 COLLABORATING ON APIS IS EASIER WITH POSTMAN (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Whether you're a team of four or 40,000, dev teams need to
collaborate on APIs. API Collaboration [5] improves developer
productivity by empowering API¬† producers and consumers to share,
discover, and reuse high-quality API assets.

Postman revolutionizes the experience of collaborative API development
with Postman Collections [6] and Workspaces [7].¬†

Used together, they enable API design, testing, and documentation
while providing a shared canvas for collaborating on API assets.¬†

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 LOAD BALANCING ALGORITHM CRASH COURSE (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Load balancing algorithms distribute network traffic across multiple
servers based on specific criteria. Round Robin sequentially
distributes requests, while Weighted Round Robin considers server
capacity. Least Connections prioritizes servers with fewer active
connections. IP Hash uses client IP addresses for session persistence.
Advanced methods like Least Response Time and Weighted Least
Connections combine multiple algorithms together. 

 ARCHITECTURES FOR CENTRAL SERVER COLLABORATION (27 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This blog post explores different architectures for building
real-time collaborative applications with a central server. It
discusses the challenges of server-side rebasing and solutions. The
post also delves into the complexities of handling text and list
editing in collaborative apps and recommends using optimistic local
updates to improve user experience.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW I FINALLY QUIT ABANDONING MY SIDE-PROJECTS AND LAUNCHED MY FIRST
PAID SAAS PRODUCT (REDDIT THREAD) [13] 

 This Reddit poster overcame their habit of abandoning side projects
and successfully launched their first paid SaaS product by identifying
and addressing the reasons they usually quit. They tackled the
complexity of projects by keeping the scope small and sticking to
familiar technologies. Time constraints were overcome by creating
dedicated time in the mornings and weekends, making sure the project
could be completed within a month. To prevent burnout, they delegated
tasks at work, took a vacation before starting the project, and used
different technologies than their day job. 

 OPINIONS AFTER A DECADE OF PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This author has changed her opinion a lot after a decade of
professional software engineering. They believe that there's no single
"right" way to do things, code isn't the most important aspect of
software engineering, and software development is inherently
political. Communication and empathy are more important in the
industry than she initially thought. 

 REFLECTING ON ONE YEAR OF BEING AN ENGINEERING MANAGER (9 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Engineering managers need to understand and tailor their approaches
to each team member's unique needs and communication styles. Being a
manager means that the business impact of your team's output is even
more critical than before. Meetings are not always bad - they are
valuable for aligning stakeholders and transferring information faster
than other methods.

 APPLE PUT A THREAD SMART HOME RADIO INTO ITS NEWEST MACS AND IPADS (4
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Apple has secretly included Thread radios in many of its newest
products, such as the iPads, MacBooks, and iMacs. The Thread radio is
a low-power, low-bandwidth mesh networking protocol ideal for smart
home devices. While Apple hasn't commented, the inclusion of Thread in
these devices could mean they could serve as home hubs, connecting
directly with smart home devices, and act as Thread border routers. 

 WHAT AREN'T THE OPENAI WHISTLEBLOWERS SAYING? (8 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 A group of current and former OpenAI employees, along with two from
Google DeepMind, have published an open letter criticizing OpenAI's
prioritization of profits and growth over AI safety. The
whistleblowers claim that OpenAI has used restrictive agreements to
silence employees' concerns. While some see the letter as evidence
that AI safety concerns are valid, others criticize it for lacking
concrete details and focusing on hypothetical risks. 

 FROM SCRATCH - GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (26 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a generative AI method
consisting of two models: a generator and a discriminator. The
generator tries to create realistic samples from a training data
distribution, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between real
and generated samples. The two models are trained in a competitive
process, with the generator improving its ability to generate
realistic samples and the discriminator enhancing its ability to
differentiate them. This article goes through building GANs from
scratch.
