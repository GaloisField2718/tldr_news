ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SYSTEMATIC PESSIMISM: SCALING QUALITY ENGINEERING WITH AUTOMATED
FAILURE DISCOVERY (16 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Systematic pessimism is an approach to quality engineering that
focuses on automated failure discovery. Traditional testing methods
often focus on "happy paths”, which test how the product is used
under ideal conditions. On the other hand, AI can be useful in
brainstorming and generating edge cases outside of happy paths, which
leads to better quality overall. 

 META'S HYPERSCALE INFRASTRUCTURE: OVERVIEW AND INSIGHTS (41 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Meta's planetary-scale computing infrastructure is built with a
culture of speed, openness, and research integrated with production.
It uses continuous deployment and serverless functions a lot, having
its own internal infrastructure to handle and scale serverless
functions. To reduce hardware costs, Meta uses hardware-software
co-design at a global scale, automatically optimizing resource
allocation across its datacenters. 

 WE REPLACED OUR REACT FRONTEND WITH GO AND WEBASSEMBLY (9 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A company called Dagger replaced its React-based cloud UI with a Go
and WebAssembly (WASM) implementation to improve performance. The
previous dual codebases (Go for the terminal UI and React for the web
UI) made it hard to maintain and move fast. Migrating to Go and WASM
allowed code reuse between the two interfaces.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TECH'S DUMBEST MISTAKE: WHY FIRING PROGRAMMERS FOR AI WILL DESTROY
EVERYTHING (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tech companies that fire devs in favor of AI will face three major
problems: a less prepared new generation of devs reliant on AI,
regretted layoffs as AI-generated code leads to security holes and
other issues, and a shortage of experienced devs over time. As junior
devs will lack experience with real-world problem-solving, companies
will struggle to fix AI-generated code, and the remaining skilled devs
will become expensive. 

 BORING TECH IS MATURE, NOT OLD (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 “Boring” technology is mature, predictable, and better than new,
flashy options in systems. This is because predictable behavior
reduces surprises and incidents, especially during critical
situations. 

 WASM WILL REPLACE CONTAINERS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 WebAssembly (WASM) will replace containers as the primary method for
deploying software. WASM offers a "write-once-run-anywhere"
experience, which is much better than containers' current complexities
and limitations. Unlike containers, WASM has the efficient benefit of
running multiple modules within the same runtime environment.

parsing expression grammars to build parsers, interpreters, compilers,
and more. 

 GO 1.24 IS RELEASED! (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Go 1.24 has been released. It features improved generics, performance
enhancements (including a new map implementation), tool updates
(including dependency tracking and a test analyzer), standard library
additions (FIPS 140-3 compliance and new packages), and enhanced
WebAssembly support.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BUILDING A PERSONAL, PRIVATE AI COMPUTER ON A BUDGET (16 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 A private AI computer runs LLMs locally. This article goes over the
specs of one built in a more cost-effective way by buying secondhand
high-end GPUs (Nvidia Tesla P40s) and repurposing an existing
workstation, resulting in a system with 48GB of VRAM for approximately
€1,700. The build required additional components due to
compatibility issues and the need for a dummy GPU for BIOS
compatibility. 

 I WROTE A STATIC WEB PAGE AND ACCIDENTALLY STARTED A COMMUNITY (9
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Local-first software development prioritizes offline functionality
and user data control. The developer of the open-source project
Tinybase created a webpage about local first that quickly gained
traction. It's now a full-fledged community, with hundreds of members
actively developing and discussing local-first software.

 NO LONGER WRITING MY OWN DAMN HTML (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Hand-coding blogs in HTML is much more time-consuming than just using
a static site generator. 

 A CATALOG OF WAYS TO GENERATE SSA (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A catalog, with commentary, on various papers about generating Static
Single Assignment (SSA) form, a program representation used in
compilers.
