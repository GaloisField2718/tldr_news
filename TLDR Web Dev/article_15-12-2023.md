ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW I BROUGHT LCP DOWN TO UNDER 350 MS FOR GOOGLE-REFERRED USERS ON
MY WEBSITE (21 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article demonstrates techniques for optimizing LCP (Largest
Contentful Paint) on high-traffic websites to under 350ms, even with a
lot of images and slow connection. This is done by making Google
prefetch HTML and critical resources on the Google Search results
page. Google does this for websites that have a high position within
Google Search results for a given phrase and have properly implemented
Signed Exchanges (SXG). The article focuses on how to add SXG to your
web application. 

 IMPROVING NODE.JS LOADER PERFORMANCE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Node.js supports two types of modules: EcmaScript (ES) modules and
CommonJS modules. ES modules are the official standard and are
supported by modern browsers, while CommonJS modules are used by
Node.js by default, but are not supported by browsers. Node.js
determines which module loader to use based on the file extension:
.mjs for ES modules, .cjs for CommonJS modules, and .js with
package.json settings. This article discusses optimizations made to
improve the performance of package.json reading and parsing in
Node.js, ultimately resulting in faster applications. 

 CALL SITE ATTRIBUTION: HOW TO PINPOINT ROGUE SQL QUERIES THROTTLING
DATABASE PERFORMANCE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This author explains how they added call site attribution to their
Node.js web app to prepare for a potential 10x growth in database
traffic. The attribution helped identify the specific location in the
source code from which SQL queries were executed, allowing for quick
identification and optimization of performance bottlenecks. Initially,
they explored solutions like Datadog tracing and monkey patching, but
eventually settled on requiring SQL queries to be tagged with a
user-defined string indicating the call site.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MAYBE GETTING RID OF YOUR QA TEAM WAS BAD, ACTUALLY. (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 DevOps initially focused on optimizing delivery pipelines and
processes, but the bottleneck in software delivery shifted to testing.
This led to a series of actions that devalued and eventually
dismantled the role of QA engineers, resulting in low-quality
software. However, quality assurance work which includes defect
tracking, bug triage, defect investigation, and end-to-end testing,
which all end up being long-term obstacles to sustainable software
development. 

 7 CHALLENGES WITH LONG-TERM PROJECTS AND HOW TO MANAGE THEM (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 When managing long-term projects with large teams, engineers should
prioritize hard problems and continually reassess them. They need to
anticipate hidden work that may arise during the project, address
attrition through redundancy, stage the value by setting intermediate
milestones, adapt to changing constraints, maintain project confidence
and perception, and avoid making exact completion time commitments.

worked for one of the largest banks in the EU since 1991. This role is
crucial for the bank's operations, and the author highlights the
challenges faced by programmers dealing with legacy systems like COBOL
and the vast amounts of data that banks must manage. The programmer

 DELETING 50,000 LINES OF CODE IN 3 DAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A developer recently deleted over 50,000 lines of code, approximately
70% of their frontend codebase, and surprisingly, this massive code
removal didn't break the application and led to a significant
simplification, making the platform feel lighter and more
user-friendly. By carefully removing rarely used modules, screens,
buttons, and features, they simplified the application, improved
performance, and streamlined development.
