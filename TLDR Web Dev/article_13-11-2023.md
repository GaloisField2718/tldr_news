ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DEMYSTIFYING THE REACT USECALLBACK HOOK (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article provides an in-depth explanation of React's useCallback
hook. useCallback helps avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing
callback functions, ensuring they are only recreated when necessary.
Using code examples, the article explains memoization, a key concept
behind useCallback, along with React.memo, a component used for
memoizing entire React components. 

 HOW ONE LINE OF CODE CAUSED A $60 MILLION LOSS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In 1990, half of AT&T‚Äôs phone network went down as a result of one
line of C code, leading to a buggy implementation of call handling.
The outage affected over a hundred thousand Americans and the company
lost $60 million. This article goes over the buggy piece of code that
was deployed by AT&T and how engineers fixed it and shares resources
for understanding reliability engineering in the modern development
world better.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ARCHIVE YOUR OLD PROJECTS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The author of this article stumbled upon a collection of old
projects, including websites and graphic design, while browsing
through a folder. These projects lacked structure and often crucial
data, prompting the author to devise a new archiving strategy. The
strategy involved leaving projects up online that don't require
maintenance, occasionally migrating them to different domains, and
archiving them with screenshots, READMEs, database backups, and
generated assets for future reference. 

 5 SKILLS THE BEST ENGINEERS I KNOW HAVE IN COMMON (5 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Great engineers have some common skills, such as technical breadth
and depth, influencing without authority, an ownership mentality,
uplifting others, and thinking about ‚Äúcode ROI‚Äù. Code ROI enables
engineers to focus on high-impact projects, while influencing without
authority refers to engineers being able to communicate clearly and
concisely. In all cases, these are traits and skills that can be
improved upon. 

 FRAMING: THE 1 MOST IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION CONCEPT EVERY SOFTWARE
ENGINEER MUST KNOW (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Effective communication and framing are important soft skills for
software engineers. Framing things in a positive manner is useful when
discussing promotions with a manager, sharing stories in interviews,
giving feedback to coworkers, and various other situations. This
article introduces a framework for framing messages effectively that
involves considering who the audience is, what you want to achieve,
what they care about, and how to explain your message in terms they
understand.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A STORY ABOUT HTTP STATUS CODES AND WHY YOU SHOULD READ DOCUMENTATION
(6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article discusses the importance of understanding HTTP status
codes and reading API documentation. The author encountered an error
triggered by a typo in a Twitch API call. Surprisingly, the API
returned an HTTP 200 status code (indicating success) for a
non-existent user, which should logically have resulted in a 404 (not
found) error. This incident highlighted the need for correct HTTP
status codes in API responses and the importance of defensive coding. 

 HOW TO WRITE COMMIT MESSAGES THAT MAINTAINERS WILL APPRECIATE (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Commit messages play a significant role in the future of open source
projects. A good commit message should clearly state the type of
change, summarize the change, and optionally include a detailed
description. Using an example, this article demonstrates how to
transform a vague commit message into one that is informative and
useful to maintainers, following the steps of specifying the commit
type, summarizing the change, and adding an optional detailed
description.
