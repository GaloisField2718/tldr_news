 INTRODUCING THE CSS ANCHOR POSITIONING API (11 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The new CSS Anchor Positioning API allows native positioning of
elements relative to anchors you define. You can set up anchors
implicitly or explicitly and then position other elements relative to
them using the anchor() function. The API also allows for centering
elements with anchor-center, anchoring to multiple elements,
positioning with inset-area, and sizing elements with anchor-size(). 

 WHAT WE LEARNED FROM A YEAR OF BUILDING WITH LLMS (PART I) (37 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 This is a comprehensive collection of ideas that helps dev work with
LLMs better in production. For example, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
Generation) is great at improving LLM performance and is preferred
over fine-tuning for adding new knowledge to a model's context. There
are tips on prompting models better, such as using JSON or XML to
structure inputs and outputs. There are also guidelines on evaluating
and monitoring LLM I/O properly in areas where LLMs are in a
production-level pipeline. 

 HOW LARGE IS A 160 BIT NUMBER? (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Dolt, a version controlled database, uses cryptographic checksums to
address data blocks. While this might lead to potential collisions
where different data blocks have the same checksum, the chance of
collision is extremely low due to the combo of SHA-512, a strong hash
function, and a 20-byte key, which provides a collision resistance of
2^80. This means that even with billions of objects stored, the
probability of a collision is small and negligible.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOUR API SHOULDN'T REDIRECT HTTP TO HTTPS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Redirecting HTTP API calls to HTTPS can mask errors and expose
sensitive data, so it's better to disable HTTP interfaces or return
errors for unencrypted requests. Many well-known APIs still redirect
HTTP to HTTPS, but some have adopted the fail-fast approach, returning
errors for unencrypted calls. API credentials sent over unencrypted
connections should be considered compromised and automatically
revoked. 

 THE DISAPPOINTMENT FRONTIER (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The disappointment frontier is the gap between a team's expectations
and reality. This gap can grow when managers shield their teams from
reality or overpromise on deliverables. Managing disappointment is a
core leadership skill, so great managers acknowledge the
disappointment frontier and actively work to shrink it.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 STOP CODING FORMS WITH A FULLY-INTEGRATED DRAG-AND-DROP FORM BUILDER
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 Tired of coding forms? With SurveyJS UI components [9], you can
generate and style dynamic JSON-based forms of any complexity right in
your JavaScript application with no need for manual coding.

The libraries utilize JSON objects for both form metadata and results,
and support seamless integration with any backend system. You can
render your custom forms and collect responses, while retaining full
control over your data.

The JSON form builder component offers a user-friendly drag-and-drop
interface, GUI for form branching, and an integrated CSS theme editor
for customizing form design.

Check out its free full-featured demo [10] to explore its capabilities
firsthand.

 OPENKODA (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 OpenKoda is a development platform that makes it easier to build
business apps and internal tools. It comes with pre-built
functionalities and out-of-the-box features. OpenKoda supports common
technologies like Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, Postgres, and HTML. 

 RAGAPP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 RAGapp is a way to use RAG in your own apps. Its configuration is
similar to OpenAI's custom GPTs, but it's deployable in your own cloud
infrastructure using Docker and whatever LLM you prefer. 

 NESTJS BOILERPLATE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This is a NestJS boilerplate that supports social sign-in, any
database, file uploads, admin and user roles, Docker, CI, and more.

 HIRING (AND MANAGING) CRACKED ENGINEERS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 PostHog prioritizes hiring and retaining "cracked" engineers who are
self-motivated and optimistic. The key to motivating and managing
cracked engineers properly is to create an environment where they can
collaborate with like-minded individuals, not have to deal with
unnecessary bureaucracy, and can just focus on the work and the
vision. 

 LLAMA 3-V: MATCHING GPT4-V WITH A 100X SMALLER MODEL AND 500 DOLLARS
(7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Llama3-V is an open-source multimodal model created by Stanford ML
researchers that's able to keep up with GPT4-Vision. The researchers
accomplished this by combining the language capabilities of Llama 3
with a vision encoder from SigLIP, using a projection block for
alignment, and prepending image tokens to textual tokens.

possible. 

 HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO BUILD AN APP LIKE SPOTIFY WITH 3 DEVS?
(REDDIT THREAD) [17] 

 A very basic Spotify clone would probably take a few months to build,
but actually building ‚Äúall of Spotify‚Äù would take decades.

 A library of effects that can be installed into your terminal. 

 ASK HN: WHY DO GAMES COMPANIES NOT RELEASE SOURCE CODE FOR OLD GAMES?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [19] 

 Companies may not have old source code anymore or it may be unclear
who actually owns the source code and not worth a company's time to
figure it out.
