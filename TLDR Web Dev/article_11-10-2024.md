ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BENCHMARKING THE PERFORMANCE OF CSS @PROPERTY (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This article benchmarks the performance of CSS @property, a new
feature that allows developers to register custom CSS properties.
PerfTestRunner was used to measure the performance of different types
of properties, including regular properties, unregistered custom
properties, and registered custom properties with different
inheritance settings. The results show that registering a custom
property with @property comes at a slight performance cost, but using
`inherits: false` when registering a custom property can significantly
improve performance. 

 SERVERLESS SERVERS AND THE CHALLENGE OF NEW REACT ARCHITECTURE (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Vercel's new "serverless server" feature optimizes Node.js
concurrency within Vercel Functions, allowing multiple requests to be
handled by a single function instance. This improvement addresses a
key challenge of React's new full-stack architecture, where increased
server traffic and async calls are needed to handle server-side
rendering and data fetching.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TYPEDDICTS ARE BETTER THAN YOU THINK (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TypedDict, introduced in Python 3.8, provides a powerful way to
type-annotate dictionaries. While initially overlooked in favor of
dataclasses and Pydantic, TypedDict works best in scenarios where not
all fields are required, such as for representing PATCH operations in
APIs. 

 AUTOMATING PROCESSES WITH SOFTWARE IS HARD (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Automating processes is far more complex than most people realize.
The difficulty stems from handling exceptions, not routine tasks. Most
automations are defined by their ability to manage unexpected inputs
and situations, making them fragile and requiring a lot of effort. 

 MY NEGATIVE VIEWS ON RUST (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Rust has a reliance on "magical sugar" constructs, which lead to
cryptic compile errors and make the language harder to learn. The
language's focus on efficient memory representation and its insistence
on no garbage collection are also detrimental, as it forces developers
to grapple with low-level details that don't always translate to
real-world performance gains.

 THE AI STARTUP DRAMA THAT'S DAMAGING Y COMBINATOR'S REPUTATION (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 PearAI, a Y Combinator startup, launched an AI code editor that
turned out to be a forked clone of an existing open-source project,
Continue.dev. The controversy stemmed from PearAI's attempt to
misrepresent its code origins and change the open-source Apache
license to a closed one. The incident raises questions about Y
Combinator's vetting process and investment strategy. 

 THE PROMIND STORY LOOKING BACKWARDS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A developer created an application that offered personalized AI
assistants for various professional tasks. Eventually, rapid growth
led to infrastructure issues, causing service disruptions and user
churn. They rebuilt their application with scalable infra. They go
through the process in this article. 

 THE EMERGING ECONOMY OF LLMS (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The key resource in the new "LLM economy” is computational power,
mainly GPUs. Tokens, the smallest units of text processed by LLMs, are
the new currency of this economy. The cost of using LLMs is typically
determined by the number of tokens processed.
