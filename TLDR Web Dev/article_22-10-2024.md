ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REACT FOLDER STRUCTURE IN 5 STEPS [2024] (22 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 When organizing React folder structure, devs should separate
components, features, and technical concerns into dedicated folders
and files for better organization and maintainability. A "barrel file"
approach should be used for public APIs, but this is becoming less
popular in JavaScript due to its impact on tree shaking. 

 HOW WE GENERATED MILLIONS OF CONTENT ANNOTATIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Spotify has built a platform to manage and scale its content
annotation processes. It focuses on three key areas: scaling human
expertise, developing flexible annotation tools, and establishing a
robust infrastructure for integration. The platform allows Spotify to
generate millions of high-quality annotations efficiently, letting it
develop and iterate on ML models faster. 

 HEADLESS, BONELESS, SKINLESS, & LIFELESS UI (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There are four categories of UI abstractions: Headless UI, Boneless
UI, Skinless UI, and Lifeless UI. "Headless UI" is a common term where
the abstractions often have underlying functionality and structure.
"Boneless" refers to UI libraries that provide composable styles but
no markup, while "skinless" provides functioning markup with no
styling. "Lifeless" UI abstractions, like TanStack, offer typesafe
hooks and logic without rendering actual UI elements, leaving the
developer responsible for applying those functions to elements and
styles.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW I USE GIT (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A good Git workflow has frequent commits, well-structured pull
requests, and a focus on the main branch. This developer personally
prefers using the CLI and advocates for a simple branching strategy.
Pull requests should also have clear commit messages with descriptions
that explain the "Why" behind the changes made. 

 USING AI GENERATED CODE WILL MAKE YOU A BAD PROGRAMMER (11 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Using AI to generate code hinders personal growth and undermines
programming skills. AI-generated code is comparable to "script kiddie"
behavior. Developers may potentially develop a dependence on AI tools,
which can lead to job displacement. 

 SOME IMPORTANT LEARNINGS FROM MY 20 YEARS OF ENGINEERING LIFE (16
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While the industry constantly evolves, fundamental principles remain
timeless. Good developers practice avoiding premature optimization,
thinking critically before coding, and mastering good practices like
clean code, design patterns, and SOLID principles.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SOLVING PPM CHALLENGES IN JIRA WITH BIGPICTURE — FROM COMPLEX
DEPENDENCIES TO ACCURATE TIMELINES (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Curious about upping your PPM game? Join an Appfire Solution Advisor

 NEXT.JS 15 (22 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Next.js 15 is now stable and ready for production use, with a range
of updates such as a new @next/codemod CLI for smoother upgrades,
asynchronous request APIs, and caching semantics changes. It also
supports React 19 and includes performance improvements with Turbopack
Dev. Next.js 15 has better observability with a new Static Route
Indicator and APIs like unstable_after and instrumentation.js. 

 FAST GRID (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Fast Grid is a high-performance web table library that utilizes
multithreading and a shared array buffer to be fast and efficient. It
can render millions of rows in constant time and maintain 120 frames
per second even while sorting, filtering, and scrolling
simultaneously. 

 REPOPACK (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Repopack is a tool that can convert an entire code repository into a
single file optimized for use with AI models like ChatGPT and Claude.
It automatically formats code for AI understanding, counts tokens for
context limits, and offers options for inclusion, exclusion, and
security checks.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW I FAILED TO MAKE A GAME (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This developer attempted to create a raycasting engine for the
GameBoy Advance. The project was initially successful, with a focus on
technical development, but ultimately failed due to the developer's
lack of interest in creating content. The process of building assets,
designing controls, and addressing the limitations of the GBA screen
was too tedious and frustrating. 

 LISKOV'S GUN: THE PARALLEL EVOLUTION OF REACT AND WEB COMPONENTS (57
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Web components, though technically useful, have been hampered by
over-aggressive promotion and a lack of early support from major
browser vendors. Meanwhile, React gained popularity by promising a
magical solution to UI development and by inadvertently commodifying
developers. This situation has led to a schism within the web
development community, with three factions: standards-oriented
developers, web component framework implementers, and other reactive
framework developers.
