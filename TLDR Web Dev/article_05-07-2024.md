 WHY VSCODE BUILT ITS OWN BUNDLER (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Next.js needed a new bundler due to the limitations of Webpack in
handling large-scale applications, particularly with the increasing
use of component libraries and the rise of computationally heavy
applications. The new bundler, Turbopack, aims to provide faster HMR
and initial compile times, maintain compatibility with existing
applications, and scale effectively for large codebases. It will also
incorporate persistent caching and production optimizations. 

 ENHANCING THE NEW YORK TIMES WEB PERFORMANCE WITH REACT 18 (11 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The New York Times upgraded its React version, which brought some

However, the result of the upgrade was immediately better performance.
For example, its INP scores in the p75 range dropped by roughly 30%
across the entire site.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE SADDEST ‚ÄúJUST SHIP IT‚Äù STORY EVER (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This author regrets not shipping his app earlier, after discovering a
competitor had launched a similar product with more features and a
larger user base. He had delayed launching his app for two years due
to perceived flaws, but realized that shipping, even with
imperfections, is much better than not shipping at all. The author
ultimately became a paying customer of the competitor's app and
believes in shipping products early to gain traction and user
feedback. 

 SHOULD YOU LEARN C TO "LEARN HOW THE COMPUTER WORKS"? (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The claim that learning C teaches you "how computers work" is
inaccurate because C operates within its own abstract machine, not
directly on the hardware. However, learning C can provide great
insights into computer architecture and operating systems, as the C
abstract machine closely maps to these elements. For programmers
primarily using higher-level languages, learning C can be valuable to
understanding how their code interacts with the underlying machine.

 ON THE ORIGINS OF DS_STORE (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 .DS_Store, which stands for "Desktop Services Store," was originally
created to store metadata like icon positions and folder settings for
the Mac OS X Finder. The name was chosen because there were plans to
make the Finder backend a public API called Desktop Services. However,
due to a bug, .DS_Store files are now excessively created even when
users don't change view settings. The Desktop Services API was never
fully released.
