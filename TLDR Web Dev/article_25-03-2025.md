 TYPESCRIPT MIGRATES TO GO: WHAT'S REALLY BEHIND THAT 10X PERFORMANCE
CLAIM? (22 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Microsoft recently announced the porting of the TypeScript compiler
from JavaScript to Go, promising a 10x performance improvement.
However, the performance increase applies specifically to the
compilation process, not the execution speed of TypeScript code
itself. The shift to Go allows for better utilization of concurrency
through goroutines, addressing the limitations of JavaScript's
single-threaded event loop, which struggles with CPU-intensive tasks
like compiling. 

 HARDWARE-AWARE CODING: CPU ARCHITECTURE CONCEPTS EVERY DEVELOPER
SHOULD KNOW (33 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Understanding CPU architecture can lead to huge performance
improvements in code. This article goes over concepts like instruction
pipelining, memory caching, and speculative execution. Optimizing code
to align with these hardware behaviors (like data structure layout,
memory access patterns, and branch prediction) can make execution time
much faster. 

 VISUAL-FOCUSED ALGORITHMS CHEAT SHEET (44 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This is a complete, visual-focused article on important algorithms
used in real-world applications. It covers various algorithms from
sorting and searching to graph, compression, and encoding, as well as
optimization, machine learning, security, and cryptographic
algorithms. Each algorithm is explained with a brief overview,
examples, and references to external resources.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AI FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IS JUST ANOTHER “PARADIGM SHIFT” (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI will allow programmers to focus on business problems rather than
replace them. AI-generated code should be treated as a level of
abstraction, similar to video drivers, helping devs recall common
patterns and accelerate initial experimentation. Human oversight is
still very important in AI-driven development, as relying solely on
AI-generated code without review can lead to bigger issues down the
road. 

 IT'S TIME TO STOP BUILDING KV DATABASES (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Key-Value databases are overused, as they are too primitive and
require devs to build data models from scratch. Relational models have
much better longevity since queries are written against a logical
schema and abstracted from physical storage details. A possible middle
ground is an embedded database with typed records and distinct logical
and physical schemas, allowing explicit query plans without a complex
query planner. 

 “DATA” SUCKS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Using "data" as a variable name in programming is a bad practice due
to its lack of specificity. It is too generic, doesn't indicate the
type or structure of the information, and encourages lazy naming.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TANSTACK QUERY DEVTOOLS EXPO PLUGIN (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 This plugin brings the full Tanstack Query DevTools experience to
Expo and React Native applications, allowing for real-time monitoring,
debugging, and manipulation of queries. It supports multi-device
connections, letting developers view device information, manage
queries, and simulate network/error states across iOS, Android, and
web Expo apps. 

 USERTOUR (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Usertour is an open-source user onboarding platform that provides
tools for creating in-app product tours, checklists, and surveys. It
integrates with various frameworks, has customizable design, and
provides detailed analytics for tracking onboarding effectiveness. 

 RSDOCTOR (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Rsdoctor is a build analyzer for both Rspack and webpack ecosystems
that offers visualization and intelligent analysis to optimize build
processes. It provides features like compilation visualization, build
artifact analysis, build-time analysis, and custom rule support.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY WE CHOSE LANGGRAPH TO BUILD OUR CODING AGENT (8 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Qodo chose LangGraph to build its coding agent due to its
flexibility, coherent interface, reusable components, and state
management. LangGraph has a graph-based approach that allows for
adaptable workflows. The framework's API makes complex systems
simpler, and its node-based architecture allows for component reuse
across different workflows. 

 COTTAGECORE PROGRAMMERS: THE IDEALIZATION OF FARMING BY TECH (20
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Many programmers express a desire to leave their desk jobs for more
hands-on work like carpentry or farming, often driven by
dissatisfaction with the impact and perceived meaninglessness of their
work. This yearning is fueled by a romanticized view of agrarian
lifestyles. While the reality of such work is actually much tougher,
it shows the disillusionment and meaninglessness many feel in tech
currently.

QUICK LINKS

 HOW THE F*CK DO YOU DO ESTIMATES? (REDDIT THREAD) [15] 

 A dev asks about estimating projects properly, and commenters
recommend using ranges instead of concrete numbers, adjusting
estimates over time as the project progresses, and creating smaller
deliverables. 

 IMPROVING RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS & SEARCH IN THE AGE OF LLMS (43
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Recommendation and search systems are using LLMs to improve model
architectures, data generation, and training, improving performance in
areas like cold-start recommendations, multimodal understanding, and
aligning user-item interactions. 

 REACT NATIVE AUTO SKELETON (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 This is a React Native library that automatically generates skeleton
loading indicators for existing UI components, with customizable
properties like shimmer speed and background color. 

 HOW TO HANDLE WORKING SOFTWARE (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 When encountering undocumented, yet perfectly functional legacy code
that has survived years of technological changes, devs should fix it,
document it, and let it continue running.
