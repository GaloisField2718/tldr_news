 IS INTEGRATION MAINTENANCE TAKING OVER YOUR LIFE? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Integrating your app with external services such as email and
calendar is taxing (time, headcount, effort, etc.). The bad news is,
building the integration is just the beginning.

Maintaining integrations [4] is one of the most time-consuming tasks
for engineering teams, and rarely budgeted for adequately. Ignore it,
and you'll find yourself scrambling to fix disastrous user
experiences.

Want to avoid falling into the black hole of integration upkeep?

In this 30-minute session [4], the Nylas engineering team will outline
the most common maintenance challenges, especially when it comes to
email and calendar [4] integrations, and what you can do about them.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REVERSE ENGINEERING TICKETMASTER'S ROTATING BARCODES (15 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 TicketMaster's SafeTix, a system that uses rotating barcodes for
mobile entry, is marketed as a security measure against fraud and
scalping, but it can be easily reverse-engineered. The barcodes
contain time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) and a bearer token,
which can be extracted and used to generate valid barcodes offline.
Despite claims of preventing offline saving and transfer, the system's
vulnerabilities allow for ticket duplication and potential resale
outside of TicketMaster's platform. 

 EXPLAINER FOR THE PROMPT API (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The "Prompt API" proposal by the Chrome built-in AI team suggests a
JavaScript API that provides access to browser-provided language
models. This will allow for local processing without server
round-trips while also allowing web developers to use AI capabilities
in web apps without worrying about costs. The proposal has a uniform
interface for prompting models and handling failures gracefully. 

 HOW FAST IS JAVASCRIPT AT SIMULATING 20,000,000 PARTICLES? (35 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 This article explores how to simulate millions of particles in
JavaScript, achieving a smooth 60 frames per second using only the
CPU, particularly focusing on optimization for mobile devices. The
author details their process, which involved several iterations,
starting with a basic multi-threaded approach using web workers and
SharedArrayBuffers. They faced challenges like flickering and
performance bottlenecks in rendering and data transfer. To improve
performance, they implemented strategies like double buffering and a
particle grid count.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE RIGHT KIND OF STUBBORN (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Persistent individuals differ from obstinate individuals who are
resistant to change and often attached to their initial ideas.
Persistence is essential for solving complex problems, while obstinacy
can be counterproductive, especially when dealing with challenging
tasks that require flexibility and adaptability. The optimal level of
obstinacy is not zero, as it can be beneficial in preventing panic in
the face of setbacks, but excessive obstinacy often leads to failure
due to an unwillingness to consider alternative solutions. 

 PYTHON HAS TOO MANY PACKAGE MANAGERS (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Python's package management ecosystem is fragmented, lacking a single
tool that effectively handles versioning, dependency resolution, and
environment setup like Rust's Cargo. Classic tools like pip and venv
have limitations in dependency management and environment isolation.
Newer tools like Poetry and PDM offer improved features but still face
challenges in areas like dependency resolution speed. 

 MAYBE YOU'RE NOT SICK OF PROGRAMMING (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Some programmers who feel burned out and disillusioned with their
careers may be wrongly attributing their discontent to programming
itself. The real culprits are often extraneous factors that hinder
creative fulfillment and lead to burnout like bureaucracy, lack of
ownership, and unfulfilling work environments.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT'S THE QUICKEST YOU'VE SEEN A CO-EMPLOYEE GET FIRED? (REDDIT
THREAD) [15] 

 Redditors share stories of the coworker they had who was the fastest
to get fired. For example, a newly hired senior developer at a company
was working on a customer enhancement directly in the production
environment and accidentally turned off a crucial setting. When asked
why he didn't work on a local copy, he replied, "We can do that?". He
was fired. 

 ENTERING TEXT IN THE TERMINAL IS COMPLICATED (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Entering text in the terminal can be confusing due to the
inconsistency in text-editing capabilities across different programs.
Some programs don't support arrow keys while others use the Readline
library for basic editing functions, some have custom input systems,
and some offer no text-editing features at all. 

 AN ORIGIN TRIAL FOR A NEW HTML `PERMISSION` ELEMENT (13 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Chrome is introducing an origin trial for a new HTML element,
`permission`, designed to address the challenges of current imperative
permission request methods like permission spam and lack of
contextualization. The `permission` element allows developers to
declaratively ask for permission to use features like geolocation.
