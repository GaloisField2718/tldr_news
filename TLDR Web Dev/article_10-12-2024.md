ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SQLITE (24 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 SQLite has become a viable option as the main database for Ruby on
Rails apps, especially for smaller apps. SQLite does have limitations
like single-writer concurrency and reliance on a single host, but its
strengths are its simplicity, ease of setup, and surprisingly good
performance on modern hardware. 

 LESSONS LEARNED FROM RUNNING REDIS AT SCALE (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mattermost scaled to 100,000 users by integrating Redis as an
external cache, solving scaling bottlenecks caused by their previous
in-memory LRU cache and its inefficient cache invalidation process.
Optimizing Redis usage involved choices like selecting the `rueidis`
library, mandating pipelining and client-side caching for reduced
latency and syscall overhead, and using `MGET`/`MDELETE` for efficient
bulk operations. 

 A LEAP IN THE EVOLUTION OF AIRTABLE'S CODEBASE: SCALING TYPESCRIPT TO
THOUSANDS OF PROJECTS (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Airtable's migration to TypeScript improved development, but the
sheer number of projects (nearly 3,000) slowed down typechecking. To
address this, Airtable restructured its codebase into smaller, more
manageable projects using Bazel and custom tools to manage
dependencies and identify bottlenecks. It used TypeScript 5.5's
Isolated Declarations feature, along with automated type generation
and improved tooling, which overall reduced typechecking time by 65%.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT CAUSES 'BAD DAYS' FOR DEVELOPERS? (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A Microsoft study revealed that engineering system friction, such as
unreliable tools, infrastructure problems, and slow processes, is the
primary cause of "bad days" for software developers. These bad days
resulted in decreased productivity, heightened stress, and self-doubt.


 ON GHOST ENGINEERS AND PROOF OR A LACK THEREOF (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A Stanford researcher's viral thread claimed that 9.5% of engineers
at major tech companies are unproductive. Critics argue that the
study's underlying research, focused on predicting code review
evaluations, doesn't directly support the "ghost engineer" claim and
that the methodology suffers from a lack of crucial statistical
measures. 

 DATA SCIENCE PROJECT FAILING AFTER 1,600 DAYS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A data science project scraping German news for COVID and Ukraine war
data was abandoned after 1,600 days of work due to the creator's loss
of interest. Sticking with a project is hard. It's helpful to have a
compelling narrative to maintain motivation through the lows.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 IF YOU WANT TO GET ONBOARDING RIGHT, YOU CAN'T RELY ON MANUAL
PROCESSES (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Bad first impressions last — and great onboarding does wonders for
retention. But you can't rely on ad-hoc processes if you want to get
it right, and avoid team members falling through the cracks. Check out
Appfire's on-demand webinar [10] and free checklist [10] to see how
you can create effective onboarding experiences that scale. 

 SORA IS HERE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI has released Sora, a text-to-video generation model, as a
standalone product for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. 

 TODOCTOR (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Todoctor is a CLI tool that collects and monitors TODO/fixme style
comments in JavaScript and TypeScript repositories. 

 RADON IDE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Radon IDE is an extension that turns VSCode or Cursor into a full
featured IDE for React Native and Expo. It has features like an
element inspector with component hierarchy, debugger and logger with
the ability to jump-to-source, and device settings adjustments for
location, language, theme, and text size.

 MEET WILLOW, OUR STATE-OF-THE-ART QUANTUM CHIP (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's new quantum chip, Willow, achieves exponential error
reduction as it scales up, solving a long-standing challenge in
quantum computing. Willow completed a benchmark calculation in under
five minutes that would take the fastest supercomputers 10 septillion
years. 

 PROTECTING UNDERSEA INTERNET CABLES: A TECH CHALLENGE (6 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Recent suspected sabotage of undersea internet cables in the Baltic
Sea highlights the vulnerability of the global communication system,
which relies heavily on these cables for transcontinental data
transfer. Protecting these cables is challenging due to their vast
length and location, with shallow coastal areas being more accessible
to potential attackers using various methods, while deeper sections
are harder to monitor. Current protective measures include satellite
surveillance and potentially, future use of unmanned underwater
vehicles (UUVs) for patrolling and monitoring. 

 TASK-SPECIFIC LLM EVALS THAT DO & DON'T WORK (33 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 LLMs have various evaluation metrics for various tracks, including
practical methods for classification (using precision, recall,
ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC), summarization (leveraging NLI models for
consistency and reward models for relevance), and translation
(employing chrF, BLEURT, and COMET). This article covers these and
more topics, like evaluating copyright infringement and toxicity
levels.

 NEW EXPERIMENTAL GEMINI MODEL HITS #1 ON LM ARENA (1 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Gemini-exp-1206 has hit #1 in all domains on LM Arena. 

 MEMORY-SAFE PNG DECODERS NOW VASTLY OUTPERFORM C PNG LIBRARIES (4
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Recent benchmarks show that memory-safe Rust-based PNG decoders
(image-rs, zune-png, and wuffs) outperform traditional memory-unsafe C
libraries (libpng, spng, and stb_image) in decoding speed, achieving
up to 1.8x improvement on x86 and 1.5x on ARM. 

 HIMALAYA (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 The Himalaya project, a Rust-based CLI email manager, has
multi-account support, various backends, PGP encryption options, and
integrations with Vim, Emacs, Raycast, and a REPL. 

 AVOID COMMON MISTAKES WHILE USING HOOKS IN REACT (9 MINUTE READ) [20]


 This article explains how to use React Hooks (useState, useRef,
useEffect, useReducer, and useContext) effectively in React apps,
detailing their purposes, use cases, and examples to guide developers
in choosing the appropriate hook for the right scenario.
