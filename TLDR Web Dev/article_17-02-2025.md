ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 "A CALCULATOR APP? ANYONE COULD MAKE THAT." (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Creating a seemingly simple calculator app is far more complex than
it seems. The Android calculator's accuracy was achieved through an
engineering feat led by Hans-J. Boehm, who used a system combining
rational arithmetic and recursive real arithmetic (RRA). This approach
balances the need for precise calculations with practical
computational limitations, dynamically switching between methods
depending on the complexity of the expression. 

 HOW TO ADD A DIRECTORY TO YOUR PATH (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This is a comprehensive guide on adding a directory to your shell's
PATH environment variable. It goes over how to identify your shell,
locate the correct configuration file, and determine the directory to
add based on the program's installation location. While the process
seems obvious at first, people commonly run into various “gotchas”
that are detailed in this article, like running the wrong program
version, duplicate PATH entries, and history loss after PATH updates.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 NASA HAS A LIST OF 10 RULES FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (19 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 NASA's ten software development rules were designed for high-stakes
embedded systems, but aren't that flexible. They're probably too
restrictive and impractical for applications beyond spacecraft
software, especially in languages offering better abstraction and
error handling. Many of the rules, like limiting function length and
forbidding dynamic memory allocation, make code readability and
maintainability worse. 

 ELON MUSK'S TERRIFYING VISION FOR AI (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Elon Musk's LLM Grok promotes Musk's views, which subtly influences
users' attitudes and beliefs, often without their awareness. Also, the
AI's reliability is questionable, with flaws in image generation and
temporal reasoning. 

 WE WERE WRONG ABOUT GPUS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Fly.io's investment in GPU-enabled machines for AI/ML inference was
unsuccessful, mostly because developers liked readily available LLMs
and APIs over managing GPUs directly. The company learned that
focusing on core features preferred by a wider dev base was more
important overall.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AI WON'T SAVE YOUR TEAM—IT WILL EXPOSE LEADERSHIP CRACKS (SPONSOR)
[9] 

 At their best, AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can be like a
hyper-productive junior engineer. But without leadership and strategy,
it can amplify chaos instead of progress. Read about how to lead in an
AI-driven world [10] on the Test Double blog [10]. 

 LLM DEBUGGER (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 The LLM Debugger is a VSCode extension using LLMs for active program
debugging, providing real-time runtime context to the LLM for faster
and more accurate bug diagnosis. It has features like active
debugging, automated breakpoint management, runtime inspection, and
synthetic data generation. 

 CADDY SERVER (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Caddy is a free, open-source, high-performance web server. It has
automatic HTTPS certificate management and unique features, like a
built-in PKI and reverse proxy capabilities. 

 ZED NOW PREDICTS YOUR NEXT EDIT WITH ZETA, OUR NEW OPEN MODEL (10
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Zed is a code editor that now has edit prediction powered by their
open-source model Zeta, allowing users to apply predicted edits with a
single tab press. The team goes over how they developed Zeta, which
was derived from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. It was developed using a rewriting
approach and refined through supervised fine-tuning and direct
preference optimization for accurate predictions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD OF (9 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Beyond Scrum, Kanban, and Scrumban, there is also ShapeUp (a 6-week
cycle emphasizing thorough planning before building), Plan-Build-Ship
(a streamlined waterfall approach), and GSD (Get Shit Done),
popularized by Shopify. Some of these approaches may better suit
startups or projects needing quick pivots, or vice versa. 

 VIM AFTER BRAM: A CORE MAINTAINER ON HOW THEY'VE KEPT IT GOING (10
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Following the death of Vim creator Bram Moolenaar, the open-source
community rallied to maintain the project. Maintainer Christian
Brabandt talked about how Vim was able to continue transitioning away
from outdated technologies and infrastructure, release Vim 9.1, and
keep addressing pull requests and issues.
