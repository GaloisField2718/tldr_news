ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 MIGRATING IN-PLACE FROM POSTGRESQL TO MYSQL (11 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Yelp Reservations, acquired in 2013, was originally built with a
PostgreSQL database. Recently, the service was migrated in-place to a
Yelp-standard MySQL database. This involved overcoming challenges like
data consistency, handling PostgreSQL-specific features, and managing
the release process with minimal service disruption. 

 DO NOT USE SECRETS IN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES. HERE'S HOW TO DO IT
BETTER (24 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Storing secrets in environment variables is a common practice but
actually may be a security risk when secrets are poorly managed,
leaked through frontend code, exposed in .env files, logged
unintentionally, or inherited by child processes. Developers should
try to use secrets stores instead. 

 SMOLDERINGLY FAST B-TREES (16 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The benchmark matters when comparing the performance of B-trees and
hashmaps. Different benchmarks show hashmaps benefit more from cache
behavior and speculative execution. B-trees avoid hashmap pitfalls
like flooding and rehashing, but hashmaps with additional measures for
order and iteration may be easier to use in development.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 COGNITIVE LOAD IS WHAT MATTERS (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cognitive load refers to the mental effort required to understand and
work with code. Excessive cognitive load can lead to confusion,
errors, and delays. Developers should work on reducing extraneous
cognitive load while working on code by avoiding overly complex
conditionals, minimizing inheritance, and using clear, self-describing
variable names. 

 THE STATIC SITE PARADOX (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ironically, professional software engineers are more likely to use
simple static HTML websites for their personal blogs, while regular
users are often stuck with more resource-intensive CMS platforms like
WordPress. This disparity is because creating a static website
requires technical knowledge and effort that many users lack, while
readily available CMS solutions are much easier to use (even though
they are more complex under the hood). 

 A MODEST CRITIQUE OF HTMX (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 htmx is an open-source front-end JavaScript library that extends HTML
with custom attributes that enable the use of AJAX directly in HTML.
While the core concept of htmx is appealing, its implementation is
more complicated because of issues with inheritance, state management,
and integration with other libraries like React. For example, htmx's
reliance on replacing DOM elements wholesale causes problems with
maintaining browser-local state and conflicts with libraries like
React that manage their own state.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SPEAKEASY: GENERATE HANDWRITTEN SDKS IN +10 LANGUAGES (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Why spend hundreds of hours your team doesn't have on building and
maintaining SDKs? With Speakeasy, [10] you can upload your OpenAPI
spec and get SDKs your API users will love, including OAuth2.0, custom
code, retries, pagination, and more. Start for free → [10] 

 BRISA (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Brisa Framework is a web platform framework that aims to unify server
and client-side development. It offers server-rendered JSX components
and minimal JavaScript shipped to the browser. Brisa uses a web
component island-based architecture, allowing for interactive elements
to be rendered on the server and hydrated on the client with native
Web APIs. 

 PLAYER.STYLE (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Player.style offers a collection of pre-built video and audio player
themes designed to be easily implemented in any web player or app
framework.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE REAL DATA WALL IS BILLIONS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTION (10 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The current focus on data as the driving force of AI progress is
misguided. Instead, the real data wall is the vast amount of
information encoded within our evolutionary history, far exceeding any
data set used in AI training. This "evolutionary data" includes not
only DNA but also the complex information embedded in the structure
and function of our cells. 

 IS AGE REALLY A FACTOR IN TECH? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Age doesn't matter in tech as long as individuals possess the
necessary skills. While some tech giants are taking steps to address
age diversity, there still needs to be systemic changes to combat
ageism in tech. 

 ON THE NATURE OF TIME (32 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 From a computational perspective, time is not a fundamental
coordinate but rather a reflection of the universe's computational
processes. This idea is supported by the concept of computational
irreducibility, which states that the only way to determine a system's
future state is to trace through each computational step. Time,
therefore, becomes a robust and irreplaceable element of our
experience, reflecting the fundamental nature of computation.

QUICK LINKS

 CANVASES VERSUS DOCUMENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Web design may be shifting away from immersive "canvas-style" layouts
and back to more structured, document-like designs. 

 DON'T LET DICTS SPOIL YOUR CODE (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 For better code structure and maintainability in Python, it's better
to use dataclasses, Pydantic, and TypedDicts instead of using
dictionaries. 

 AUTOMATTIC IS DOING OPEN SOURCE DIRTY (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The creator of Ruby on Rails argues that Automattic's demand for 8%
of WP Engine's revenue is a violation of open source principles and
the GPL license. 

 WHAT'S NEW IN RUBY ON RAILS 8 (9 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Rails 8 introduces updates like easier deployments, a modern asset
pipeline, improved SQLite capabilities, and more Active Record
features.
