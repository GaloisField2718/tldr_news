ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 IS AURORA DSQL YOUR NEXT DATABASE? (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Amazon launched Aurora DSQL, a serverless, globally distributed
database, at Re:Invent 2024. Aurora DSQL has high availability,
multi-regional capabilities, and claims significantly faster speeds
than Google Cloud's Spanner, making achieving global scale easier
through decoupled compute and storage and Amazon Time Sync Service.
However, the service is still in its early stages, lacking essential
features like foreign keys and triggers, and its authentication method
presents challenges for application integration. 

 WEBHOOKS ARE HARDER THAN THEY SEEM (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 While webhooks appear simple (an HTTP POST request), building a
robust webhook system presents many challenges. These challenges
include ensuring reliability (handling failures and retries),
implementing strong security measures (authentication, SSRF
prevention), and achieving scalability (managing potentially massive
event volumes). For good webhook adoption, webhooks need a positive
dev experience with good observability. 

 RAILING AGAINST TIME: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES THAT GOT US 5X FASTER
TESTS (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Developers were able to get a test suite down from 53 minutes to 11
minutes by using a combination of profiling tools, RSpec techniques,
and code refactoring. Their optimization strategy focused on
identifying high-value targets, prioritizing easy wins, and
consistently measuring results. The process involved three main
phases: general optimizations, factory optimization, and optimizing
individual test files using techniques like `let_it_be` (which means
using shared test data instead of creating new test data for each
test).

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 EGOLESS ENGINEERING (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Overly specialized roles in companies can create silos and make
collaboration tougher. Egoless engineering promotes shared
responsibility, cross-functional teamwork, and a culture of
collaboration. It's up to leadership to make sure that they are
creating "domain experts" rather than "domain owners,” which leads
to a healthier organization long-term. 

 SQL BEST PRACTICES – DON'T COMPARE COUNT(*) WITH 0 (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Instead of using `COUNT(*)` to find users without addresses, use `NOT
EXISTS` for better performance. `COUNT(*)` unnecessarily counts all
rows before rejecting them, while `NOT EXISTS` stops checking as soon
as a match is found. 

 BEING IN THE DETAILS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Flattened organizations demand managers to be more hands-on.
Effective management requires knowing the details without
micromanaging and delegating responsibility while retaining
accountability for decisions and outcomes. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SECURITY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A PAIN (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Too many security tools are built for non-technical decision makers,
which makes them incredibly clunky for developers to actually use.
Arcjet takes a developer-first approach [11]: add a few lines to your
code for bot detection, rate limiting, email validation, attack
protection, and data redaction. See a live example [11] 

 AMAZON AURORA DSQL (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Amazon Aurora DSQL is a serverless, distributed SQL database that
offers virtually unlimited scale, high availability, and ease of use
with no infrastructure management. 

 ES TOOLKIT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 es-toolkit is a high-performance, small-bundle-size JavaScript
utility library that offers various functions with improved
performance and TypeScript support. 

 STAGEHAND (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Stagehand is an open-source, AI-powered web automation framework
built on Playwright that offers simple APIs (act, extract, and
observe) for natural language-driven web interactions. It supports
various LLMs.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DESIGNING DATA PRODUCTS (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Engineers should take a use-case-driven approach when designing data
products. This means starting with a specific use case and working
backward to identify necessary data products, where each is
self-contained and valuable. This iterative process avoids
over-engineering by focusing on the minimal viable data product and
gradually generalizing as more use cases are considered. 

 OPTIMIZATION ADVENTURES: MAKING A PARALLEL RUST WORKLOAD 10X FASTER
WITH (OR WITHOUT) RAYON (29 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This blog post details an optimization journey to improve a parallel
Rust workload's speed tenfold. Initially, using the Rayon library only
yielded a 2x speedup, prompting a deeper investigation using profiling
tools like `strace` and `perf`. The author identified excessive system
calls and cache misses as bottlenecks, leading him to create a custom
parallel implementation tailored to his specific use case. 

 THE OPEN-SOURCE TOOLKIT FOR BUILDING AI AGENTS (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This post provides a curated list of open-source tools and frameworks
for building AI agents. There are various categories of tools,
including frameworks for agent orchestration, tools for computer and
browser interaction, voice integration, document understanding, memory
management, testing, monitoring, simulation, and examples of vertical
agents.

registered new top-level domains (.shop, .top, .xyz, etc.), which are
attractive to scammers.
