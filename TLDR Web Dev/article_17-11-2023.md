 HOW TO SCALE A LARGE CODEBASE (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Vercel uses a monorepo architecture to organize and reuse code
efficiently across teams. Its team suggests using Turborepo for
monorepo management and emphasizes the importance of feature flags for
safe code release, incremental builds for quick iteration, and skew
protection to handle version discrepancies. Thanks to their monorepo
and these tools, they are able to have frequent and confident code
releases, easy adoption of new technologies, independent work on UI
parts, and efficient sharing and reuse of code. 

 A FASTER WEB IN 2024 (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers
important in a webpage's overall user experience. The interaction
responsiveness metric Google uses in its Core Web Vitals assessment is
changing in 2024 to INP (integration to next paint). This post
outlines how this metric is uncovering issues that have been flying
under the radar. Many websites today are bound to fail this metric and
the post looks at what developers can do to mitigate such issues.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 STOP PARROTING YOUTUBE SOLUTIONS IN SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEWS (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post looks at five common mistakes in system design interviews
and how to avoid them. These mistakes include not prioritizing
scenarios properly, talking too abstractly, having a shallow design
implementation, speaking about superficial tradeoffs, and having
irrelevant failure discussions. Overall, it‚Äôs important to focus on
core questions asked during a system design interview and understand
what the interviewer is looking for that gives them a ‚Äúhire‚Äù
signal. 

 YOU DON'T NEED CRDTS FOR COLLABORATIVE EXPERIENCES (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) are commonly used for
collaborative experiences, but are not necessary for them. They are
essential in specific scenarios like offline-first applications and
text editing, where they prevent overwriting and ensure accurate
character placement. However, CRDTs have downsides, such as
ever-growing state, complex implementations, and opaque data storage.
Instead of CRDTs, collaborative applications, like spreadsheets,
presentation tools, form builders, and more, can benefit from
contextual information, locking mechanisms for safety, small-scale
updates, and real-time updates distribution. This approach allows for
effective real-time collaboration without the complexities of CRDTs.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 üòò KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 If you've tried to build automated test coverage in-house, you know
it takes years to scale. Try QA Wolf [9] instead - they get web apps
to 80% test coverage in just 4 months. They will create and maintain
your test suite in Playwright (no vendor lock-in, you own the code),
and provide unlimited parallel test runs on their infrastructure.¬†
QA Wolf has multiple case studies of customers saving at least
$200k/year in QA engineering and infrastructure costs. Schedule a demo
to learn more. [9]

 SCREENSHOT-TO-CODE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Screenshot-to-code converts a screenshot to HTML and Tailwind CSS. It
uses GPT-4 Vision to generate the code and DALL-E 3 to generate
similar looking images. You must use your own GPT-4 Vision API key in
order to use it. 

 MAKEREAL (WEBSITE) [11] 

 MakeReal is a canvas where you can draw anything and have GPT-4 turn
it into actual working code. 

 VITE 5 IS OUT! (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Vite 5 has been released. Vite is the main development environment
for new React applications that aren‚Äôt based on create-react-app or
Next.js. The new release of Vite comes with a host of changes, such as
performance improvements.

 THE LACK OF COMPENSATION IN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IS UNSUSTAINABLE (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Maintainer burnout can happen with open-source projects that have
garnered significant usage but no financial compensation. One solution
to this is a compensation model that pays active contributors to
highly utilized products. Companies using open-source software should
either contribute financially or allocate developer time to these
projects. 

 PLANNING FOR UNPLANNED WORK (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Unplanned work, which includes bug reports and emergencies, can cause
friction to a team‚Äôs productivity. Managing unplanned work involves
two phases: intake and execution. Intake focuses on turning unexpected
issues into actionable tasks, emphasizing the need for a frictionless
process to ensure comprehensive reporting. The execution phase centers
on efficiently resolving these issues, such as using a shared team
inbox for bugs. Clearly defined roles and Service-Level Agreements
(SLAs) help maintain accountability and prioritize urgent work. 

 25% OR 6 TO 4: THE 11/6/23 AUTHENTICATION OUTAGE (9 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Discord recently had an outage where their authentication service was
down for 50 minutes, which prevented users from connecting, logging
in, and receiving messages. The outage was from an underlying ScyllaDB
cluster being overloaded from an OS upgrade and a degraded disk. This
post explains in detail how the upgrade caused the failure.
