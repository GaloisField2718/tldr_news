OPINIONS & ADVICE

 REDUCE THE NOISE, MAKE SPACE FOR PROGRESS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 It‚Äôs challenging to manage constant distractions and information
overload in today‚Äôs world. The brain is not great at multitasking -
productivity is higher when software engineers focus on one thing at a
time. Adopting a low-information diet and focusing on content that
requires sustained attention, like books or podcasts, trains the brain
for better focus. It is important to manage communication effectively.
Process-centric communication reduces the need for constant
back-and-forth messaging. 

 CODING IS ACTUALLY HARD (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The author of this post shares their personal journey and struggles

using various online resources. Despite early enthusiasm, they faced
significant challenges in moving from theory to practice, often
feeling overwhelmed and doubting their abilities. The post reflects on
the ongoing struggle and the realization that coding is inherently
challenging but achievable with persistence.
