 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 APPLE HAS A PRIVATE CSS PROPERTY TO ADD LIQUID GLASS EFFECTS TO WEB
CONTENT (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The private Apple CSS property, `-apple-visual-effect`, enables the
"Liquid Glass" effect in iOS webviews. Although this property works
when manually enabled, it's inaccessible for general web development
and App Store apps due to its private status. Apple probably uses this
feature internally to seamlessly integrate webviews into the iOS UI. 

 FALSEHOODS PROGRAMMERS BELIEVE ABOUT NULL POINTERS (12 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Programmers commonly have some misconceptions about null pointers in
languages like C, C++, and Rust. This article debunks assumptions
ranging from immediate crashes upon dereferencing to the guaranteed
address of zero for null pointers. These misconceptions come from
compiler optimizations, platform-specific quirks, and the evolving
understanding of undefined behavior. 

 WHY ARE EVENT-DRIVEN SYSTEMS HARD? (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Event-driven systems use asynchronous messages to trigger actions.
These often have to deal with evolving message formats, which requires
strategies like backward/forward compatibility and schema registries
to avoid system failures. Debugging is difficult due to the
distributed nature, but correlation IDs allow for tracing events
across services.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 REACT WON BY DEFAULT – AND IT'S KILLING FRONTEND INNOVATION (9
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The widespread default adoption of React in frontend development is
stifling innovation. While React is excellent, its dominance
discourages the adoption and evaluation of potentially better-suited
frameworks like Svelte, Solid, and Qwik. These frameworks offer unique
approaches such as compile-time optimization and fine-grained
reactivity, which devs should also try to keep in mind. 

 WHY DO SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS LOVE COMPLEXITY? (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Software developers often gravitate towards complexity despite the
KISS principle due to its marketability and the perception that it
signals expertise and innovation. This complexity can be driven by
marketing hype, the creative satisfaction of solving intricate
problems, the need to navigate existing convoluted codebases, and
pressures to innovate within competitive team dynamics. However,
unnecessary complexity creates a maintenance nightmare.

 INTRODUCING UPGRADES TO CODEX (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI has released GPT-5-Codex, a better version of GPT-5 optimized
for agentic coding within Codex. Codex now integrates with ChatGPT and
supports various platforms like terminals, IDEs, and even mobile apps.
It has a revamped Codex CLI, a new IDE extension, improved cloud
infrastructure, and code review capabilities trained to catch flaws
before deployment. 

 MACOS TAHOE (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 macOS Tahoe introduces a fresh, Liquid Glass design, better
Continuity with iPhone through a new Phone app and Live Activities,
Apple Intelligence integration for productivity boosts, and various
updated features across apps like Messages, Photos, and Reminders. 

 SEMLIB (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Semlib is a Python library that enables the creation of data
processing and analysis pipelines using LLMs. It provides functional
programming primitives like map, reduce, sort, and filter, but uses
natural language descriptions instead of code for these operations.
This approach breaks down complex tasks into simpler steps for
improved quality, feasibility, latency, and cost-effectiveness.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHICH NPM PACKAGE HAS THE LARGEST VERSION NUMBER? (15 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 This dev investigated which npm package has the largest number in its
version by fetching package data from the npm registry. After fetching
metadata for millions of packages, they initially found
"latentflip-test" with a very large version number, which they
considered invalid. After filtering and manual inspection, the author
discovered that "all-the-package-names" has version 2.0.2401, making
it the npm package following semantic versioning with the largest
valid number. 

 HOSTING A WEBSITE ON A DISPOSABLE VAPE (7 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This dev hosted a website on a disposable vape's microcontroller, the
PUYA PY32F002B. He used semihosting to emulate a serial modem,
enabling SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) communication and
integrating uIP for TCP/IP support. It was initially slow, but he
optimized the web server by implementing a ring buffer to improve data
handling and speed. 

 AI HYPE IS MASKING RECESSION SIGNALS IN THE MARKET (5 MINUTE READ)
[20] 

 Despite record highs driven by AI excitement, the stock market is
masking underlying recessionary signals in other sectors. These AI
investments are primarily driving market performance, rather than
consumer spending. However, a market rotation is beginning, with
investors eyeing previously struggling sectors anticipating potential
interest rate cuts and the impact of AI on productivity.

QUICK LINKS

 BORING WORK NEEDS TENSION (2 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Software developers can make their work more engaging by actively
seeking out and resolving technical challenges ("tensions") that come
up in their daily tasks. 

 VIBE CODING IS CREATING BRAINDEAD CODERS (8 MINUTE READ) [24] 

 While AI coding tools can increase productivity, they also risk
creating a generation of developers who lack deep understanding and
problem-solving skills. 

 HOW TO SELF-HOST A WEB FONT FROM GOOGLE FONTS (3 MINUTE READ) [25] 

 To avoid leaking visitor IP addresses to Google, download Google
Fonts files, self-host them with relative paths, link the CSS file in
your HTML, apply the font in your CSS, and include the font's license.


 DEATH💀 TO TYPE CLASSES (11 MINUTE READ) [26] 

 Replacing Haskell's type classes with the Backpack module system
might be a simpler, faster approach to effect systems, as you can
implement Functors and effects using Backpack modules and signatures.
