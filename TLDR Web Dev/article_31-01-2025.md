 AI CODING AGENTS FOR THE SOUL-CRUSHING PARTS OF ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE
DEVELOPMENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 There's a lot of BS about AI coding agents...

Sourcegraph's AI coding agents [4] actually work.

>> Our Code Review Agents use specific rules you define, instead of
trying (and failing) to replace humans entirely.

>> We use search + AI to help you define rules precisely and eval
against recent PRs, so it never nitpicks and seldom annoys.

>> Enterprise dev teams from some of the most important companies like
Stripe, Uber, Indeed, and Palo Alto Networks are using Sourcegraph.

Start using Sourcegraph code search & AI [4]¬†and¬†sign up for the Feb
6th livestream [5]¬†for early agent access and live demos.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SCALING OUR RATE LIMITS TO PREPARE FOR A BILLION ACTIVE CERTIFICATES
(12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Let's Encrypt, a free certificate authority, faced challenges scaling
its rate-limiting system to handle over 550 million websites and
340,000 certificate requests per hour. Its initial MariaDB-based
system wasn't enough, as it caused slowdowns and frustrated users with
long wait times. To address this, the company migrated to a
Redis-based system that used the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA),
allowing it to handle a billion active certificates and even
addressing the issue of "zombie clients" making repeated failed
requests. 

 OPEN-CLOSED PRINCIPLE IN REACT: BUILDING EXTENSIBLE COMPONENTS (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In React, the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) means that components
should be designed in a way that allows them to be extended with new
functionality without modifying their existing code. As an example,
the article shows the contrast between a closed, modification-heavy
button component with an open, composition-based approach that uses
base components and extending variants. There's an alignment between
OCP and React's "composition over inheritance" philosophy, where OCP
leads to more flexibility.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 PAUSE ‚Äì DECISION-MAKING SUPERPOWER (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 One should pause before making a decision, since taking time allows
for better perspective and the chance to avoid regrettable actions.
This author shares personal anecdotes that illustrate how pausing
prevents rushed estimations and impulsive responses to emails. 

 RUST'S WORST FEATURE* (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This developer criticizes Rust's nightly `core::io::BorrowedBuf`
feature, arguing it's a complex and flawed solution to the problem of
unnecessary buffer initialization in I/O operations. The feature aims
to allow reading into uninitialized memory, but its integration with
existing code is poor and requires explicit support from various APIs,
which could lead to potential misuse. 

 REACT ROUTER V7 HAS TO BE A PSYOP (REDDIT THREAD) [10] 

 React Router v7 makes routing more complex and unintuitive. 

üöÄ 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AHEY (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Ahey is a free, unlimited pub-sub service that uses web push
technology to send real-time notifications to any browser via HTTP
POST requests. 

 GREENMASK (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Greenmask is an open-source tool for PostgreSQL database backup,
anonymization, synthetic data generation, and restoration. It has
features like deterministic transformers, dynamic parameters, and
parallel execution, and it supports various storage options. 

 RUCK (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Ruck is an open-source, buildless React framework for Deno that uses
ESM, dynamic imports, and import maps to create React web apps without
build steps. It has features like dynamic routing, server-side
rendering with component-level data fetching, and declarative CSS
management.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW WE ACCIDENTALLY BUILT A BETTER BUILD SYSTEM FOR OCAML (7 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Jane Street initially created Jenga, an OCaml build system, but its
limited reach and platform incompatibility led to its
un-open-sourcing. It then developed Jbuilder, a simpler,
cross-platform tool, which unexpectedly gained popularity due to its
speed. Jbuilder evolved into Dune, a more robust build system, after a
name change and significant community contributions. 

 DECOMPILING 2024: A YEAR OF RESURGENCE IN DECOMPILATION RESEARCH (8
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 2024 saw a resurgence in decompilation research, with nearly 30% of
all top-tier publications in the field's history appearing that year.
This surge included advancements in defining "good" decompilation, the
incorporation of AI techniques for tasks like symbol prediction, and a
significant increase in open-source implementations of academic work. 

 WHY AREN'T YOU IDEMPOTENT? (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Idempotency is important in distributed systems, particularly for
low-latency APIs. It makes sure that repeated requests produce the
same outcome as a single request, preventing unintended side effects
from retries in unreliable networks. This author details techniques
for creating idempotent endpoints, including client-supplied
identifiers and timestamps and calibrated counters, using Apache
Cassandra as a case study.

QUICK LINKS

 STATS (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Stats is a macOS system monitor app that provides CPU, GPU, memory,
disk, network, battery, sensor, and Bluetooth monitoring in the menu
bar. 

 WRITING BRITTLE CODE (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Writing "brittle" code - code that breaks rather than bends under
stress - is a better approach to maintainability, especially in large
organizations where generalists maintain code written by specialists. 

 FIND THE OLDEST LINE IN YOUR REPO (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This developer created a bash script to find the oldest lines in a
Git repository by using `git blame` and filtering for lines committed
before 2030. 

 THE SPEED TRIFECTA: 11TY, BROTLI 11, AND CSS FINGERPRINTING (14
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This blog post details how to optimize CSS delivery using Eleventy,
Brotli compression (level 11), and CSS fingerprinting, which results
in smaller file sizes and better caching.
