 INTRODUCING SAFETEST: A NOVEL APPROACH TO FRONT END TESTING (7 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 UI tests have traditionally been conducted through either unit
testing or end-to-end (E2E) tests. Both approaches have tradeoffs.
With unit tests, you have control over what to render and how the
underlying services and imports should behave. However, you lose the
ability to interact with an actual page. With E2E tests, you have
control over the page but deal with pain points like the inability to
make assertions on mocks and test segments of the app. SafeTest aims
to address these issues by having a snippet of code in the application
bootstrapping stage that injects hooks to run tests. It uses
Playwright to run regular tests, thereby achieving ideal browser
control. SafeTest also provides reports on when and how any failures
occurred which include playback videos or steps to reproduce the
failure. 

 HOW TO CENTER A DIV IN CSS (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 'How to center a div in CSS' is one of the most common questions
developers google. There are various methods to center a div with CSS,
such as by using text-align, flexbox, CSS Grid, positioned layout with
auto margins, or a flow layout with auto margins. To choose the right
method, a developer should decide if the centering is horizontal,
vertical, or both, think about the number of elements being centered,
and consider the layout context (flow, positioned, or grid). Flexbox
is a good default choice for centering divs. 

 FINISHING TURBOREPO'S MIGRATION FROM GO TO RUST (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Turborepo, a fast JavaScript build system, was ported from Go to
Rust. This porting process involved several challenges, such as
ensuring hash stability and maintaining compatibility with the Go
version. This post discusses lessons learned from the porting process,
such as the importance of using a single serialization format from the
start and shipping each porting strategy faster.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ASK HN: HOW DO YOU COME UP WITH SIDE PROJECT IDEAS IN 2024? (HACKER
NEWS THREAD) [8] 

 Hacker News commenters recommend building projects for yourself to
solve your own problems rather than trying to go looking for ideas.
They recommend working on something that makes you personally happy so
that you can return to work on it often organically without forcing
yourself to. Building things and taking action often leads to better
things, even if the ‚Äúbetter thing‚Äù is not clear from the start. 

 HOW TO MANAGE ON-CALL DUTIES (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An in-depth guide to what on-calls are, their benefits and downsides,
and how they work in practice. It also has some interesting
perspectives on whether on-calls should be mandatory and compensated.
The guide offers many useful tips on how to maintain on-call runbooks,
escalation processes, and creating effective on-call practices such as
establishing feedback mechanisms for on-call members to share
experiences and suggest feedback. It advocates for EM to join the
on-call and explains why.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MEMORY AND NEW CONTROLS FOR CHATGPT (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ChatGPT is being updated with the ability to remember information
from past conversations, which will make it more personalized in
future interactions. Users will have control over what information is
remembered and can tell the chatbot to forget things if they want.
This feature is currently being tested with a small group of users and
will be rolled out more broadly soon.

 Unlazy is a lazy loading library that leverages native browser APIs.
It's intended for use with the loading="lazy" attribute alongside
(blurry) placeholder images. 

 LINEN (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Linen is a real-time thread-first messaging platform. It‚Äôs designed
for deep work first, with organized channels, a centralized inbox, and
personalized notifications.

 A LOOK AT INTERNET TRAFFIC TRENDS DURING SUPER BOWL LVIII (10 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 This blog post explores the traffic trends from Super Bowl ads. It
also looks at local traffic trends seen during the game, as well as
email threat volume across related categories in the weeks ahead of
the game. Some interesting conclusions: most Super Bowl ads no longer
drive traffic to associated websites by including a URL in their ad.
However, the DNS traffic analysis in the post shows that viewers
don‚Äôt seem to have much trouble finding these sites. In-game events
had a mixed impact on traffic across domains associated with multiple
types of apps, as well as traffic for the websites associated with the
teams playing in the Super Bowl. 

 ENGINEERING PRACTICES FOR LLM APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT (15 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 It‚Äôs important to have automated testing, refactoring of prompts,
and defending against adversarial attacks to ensure the reliability
and security of LLM applications. This article demonstrates the
necessity of thoughtful prompt design, ethical considerations, and
incorporating feedback early in the development process through
examples and discussions. Like with all development, a lot of core
software principles still apply to LLM applications. 

 IS SOMETHING BUGGING YOU? (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 FoundationDB is the underpinning of Apple‚Äôs current cloud
infrastructure. The creators of FoundationDB have created Antithesis,
a deterministic autonomous testing platform designed to find bugs in
software. When developing FoundationDB, their testing infrastructure
was renowned for its effectiveness. Antithesis performs deterministic
simulations to test software and find bugs.

 CAN A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IMPLEMENT TIME TRAVEL? (7 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Some languages have tools that let you manipulate program states
across time. General relativity theory suggests time can move in both
directions, so it is theoretically possible that one day, programming
languages may implement some form of time travel using ideas like
time-loop logic.
