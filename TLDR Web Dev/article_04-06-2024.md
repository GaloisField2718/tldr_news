 PROMISES FROM THE GROUND UP (19 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Promises in JavaScript aren't always intuitive to use, but they're
required to be productive with JavaScript. Promises are needed because
JavaScript is single-threaded, which can cause issues when blocking
operations like window.prompt() are used. This post dives into the
mechanics of Promises, their states (pending, fulfilled, rejected),
and how to work with them using the .then() and .catch() methods. It
also covers creating custom Promises, chaining them together, passing
data between them, and the modern async/await syntax for a more
synchronous-like experience. 

 THE ARCHITECTURE OF GRAB'S DATA LAKE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Grab manages its data using a data lake, using different storage
formats for high and low throughput data. For high-throughput data,
which is frequently updated, it uses Apache Avro with a Merge on Read
(MOR) strategy, appending new data to log files for efficient writes
and periodically compacting them for manageable reads. For
low-throughput data with infrequent updates, it uses Parquet with Copy
on Write (CoW), creating new file versions for each write. 

 PARSING JSON IS A MINEFIELD (33 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Parsing JSON, despite its seemingly simple format, is actually quite
challenging because there are so many specifications that can be
interpreted in different ways. This has led to inconsistencies in how
different JSON parsers handle edge cases, extreme values, and
maliciously crafted payloads, resulting in potential bugs, crashes,
and denial-of-service vulnerabilities. This article goes into detail
about this issue with examples of different types of objects (arrays,
objects, numbers, and strings) combined with different types of
parsers (C Parsers, Regex, and more).

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY I RETIRED FROM THE TECH CRUSADES (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The creator of Ruby on Rails, David Heinemeier Hansson, realized that
the success of the framework was not due to his attempts to convince

preferences of programmers and encouraging them to find the language
that best suits their individual style and needs.

READ) [8] 

 The "Skip to main content" link in website accessibility for
keyboard-based navigation is really useful for a lot of users. Adding

 SCIENTISTS SHOULD USE AI AS A TOOL, NOT AN ORACLE (8 MINUTE READ) [9]


 The hype surrounding AI has led to flawed research practices in
various scientific fields, resulting in a reproducibility crisis that
is likely to worsen due to the growing adoption of LLMs.

 DO NEW DEVS RELY ON AI TOO MUCH? (REDDIT THREAD) [17]
