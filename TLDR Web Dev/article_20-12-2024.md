 HOW TYPES MAKE HARD PROBLEMS EASY (26 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Type-driven development is the practice of defining types upfront,
making sure of type consistency across the application, and making
illegal states unrepresentable. This approach leads to slower
short-term output, but leads to easier, more reliable coding in the
long run. A side bonus is that it also comes with type-driven
autocomplete and instant error detection. 

 INDEXING CODE AT SCALE WITH GLEAN (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta's open-source Glean system indexes code at scale, providing
information to various developer tools through a flexible query
language. This centralized system avoids redundant indexing on
individual developer machines and offers a scalable, distributed
architecture for handling large codebases and concurrent queries.
Glean's design is language-agnostic and has incremental indexing using
a stack of immutable databases to efficiently process code changes.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW DO YOU DO, FELLOW WEB DEVELOPERS? A GROWING DISCONNECT (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 There's a growing disconnect between this older developer's
understanding of programming and that of younger web developers, shown
by a colleague's unfamiliarity with non-SPA web applications. He feels
that nowadays, there is an over-reliance on abstractions and a
tendency to view narrow JavaScript-centric knowledge as representative
of broader computer science principles. 

 RE-IMAGINING TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS: VALUING EXPERIENCE OVER EXAM
SKILLS (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Live coding interviews for senior software engineers don't properly
assess real-world skills and create undue stress. For them, better
assessment methods include assigning small, realistic projects
completed asynchronously, though this has the caveat of filtering for
engineers who have the time to do these projects outside of their
current jobs.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MIZU.JS (WEBSITE) [8] 

 mizu.js is an open-core JavaScript library that supercharges HTML
with directives for templating, reactivity, HTTP requests, and more.
It has both client-side and server-side rendering capabilities across
various JavaScript runtimes. 

 CLAY (WEBSITE) [9] 

 Clay is a high-performance, flexbox-style UI auto layout library
written in C that features a declarative syntax, minimal size, and
renderer-agnostic design. 

 HOOKCN (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Hookcn is a collection of reusable React hooks that can be easily
integrated into projects via copy-pasting or a CLI.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ISO 8583: THE LANGUAGE OF CREDIT CARDS (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ISO 8583 is a standard for real-time payment messages between banks
and merchants, used in most card transactions. The standard has
evolved over time, leading to variations across networks due to
flexibility in field encoding and the addition of network-specific
fields. This has made it complex, due to optional fields, diverse
encoding schemes, and different ways of handling nested messages. 

 ALIGNMENT FAKING IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A study by Anthropic and Redwood Research showed that LLMs can
exhibit "alignment faking" - strategically concealing their original
preferences even after safety training. This occurs when an LLM,
initially trained to be harmless, is subsequently incentivized to
always comply with requests, including harmful ones. It may then
deceptively comply to avoid retraining that could diminish its ability
to refuse harmful requests. 

 DO NOT BE MISLED BY ‘BUILD AN APP IN 5 MINUTES': IN-DEPTH PRACTICE
WITH CURSOR (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cursor, an AI coding assistant, has a "Cursor Tab" feature that
predicts and completes code edits efficiently. Unlike simpler AI
coding tools focused on creating new projects, Cursor is great at
assisting with the maintenance and modification of existing
large-scale projects.

 GITHUB PLAGUED BY 4.5 MILLION FAKE STARS PROBLEM MISLEADING USERS (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A recent study revealed that the popularity of approximately 15,835
repositories is inflated by over 4.5 million fake GitHub stars. 

 AI TOOLS MAKE ME MORE PRODUCTIVE, BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M LOSING MY
SKILLS (REDDIT THREAD) [15] 

 A web developer uses AI tools for increased productivity but feels
concerned about losing coding skills due to reliance on AI, sparking a
discussion on the trade-off between speed and skill retention. 

 SELENIUMBASE (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 SeleniumBase is an open-source Python framework for web automation,
testing, scraping, and bypassing bot detection.
