ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 AN INTERACTIVE STUDY OF COMMON RETRY METHODS (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article explores common retry methods for network requests,
which are necessary for preventing errors from reaching users. The
article starts by demonstrating basic retry handling without delay,
which increases server load and the risk of overload. To counter this,
exponential backoff is introduced, which is a method that initially
retries quickly and then gradually increases the wait time. The
interactive study concludes with a Go code example implementing
exponential backoff with jitter, a technique to randomize wait times
between retries. 

 THE ARCHITECTURE OF DOORDASH'S CACHING SYSTEM (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DoorDash transitioned from a Python monolith to a microservices
architecture, using Kotlin and gRPC for service communication. To
minimize latency, it focused on reducing network requests, primarily
by implementing caching with Caffeine for local caching and Redis
Lettuce for distributed caching. However, different teams
independently creating caching solutions led to issues like cache
staleness, lack of runtime controls, inadequate metrics, and
inconsistent key schemas. To address this, DoorDash developed a shared
caching library with features like layered caching (request local,
local, and Redis caches), runtime feature flags for customization, and
observability tools to monitor cache performance.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 REFLECTING ON 18 YEARS AT GOOGLE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ian Hickson, the creator of Flutter (cross-platform app SDK) reflects
on their 18-year tenure at Google, from its early post-IPO days to
recent years. Initially, Google's culture was driven by a genuine
desire to do good, guided by the "don't be evil" principle. However,
over time, cultural shifts occurred, with less transparency and a
shift in focus from user benefit to company and individual gain.
Recently, Google's morale has declined, especially due to layoffs, and
Hickson perceives a lack of visionary leadership and an increase in
inept middle management. 

 EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meetings are often seen as detrimental to the productivity of
software engineers. Writing is a more efficient alternative to reduce
the load of meetings. There are several advantages to writing: it
enables faster information consumption as reading is quicker than
listening, facilitates easier referencing and searching of technical
content, and typically results in higher quality outcomes due to
focused preparation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT IS A STAFF ENGINEER? (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Staff Engineers in big-tech companies like Meta are highly
experienced technical leaders who play various roles like Tech Lead,
Coding Machine, or Fixer. They differ from Senior Engineers in their
focus on team rather than individual impact and have a broader
organizational influence. Their duties include building domain
strategies, clarifying project plans, de-risking projects, and
ensuring team health. 

 MAKING A FONT (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The author shares their experience of creating a font for the first
time. Previously relying on digital text drawing, which sometimes led
to inconsistent text size and readability, they decided to design a
font based on their own handwriting. This endeavor involved learning
about font anatomy, such as ascenders, baselines, and x-heights, and
experimenting with two iterations of the font. The final design was
derived from writing sentences naturally on paper, scanning them, and
cleaning them up digitally. They used software to successfully create
a TrueType font (TTF).
