ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE OF PALIA (28 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The MMO Palia has a complex architecture, using Unreal Engine for its
game engine and a microservice approach with services for specific
player features. The game uses ScyllaDB (column store) for its main
database along with PostgreSQL for specific use cases where a
relational model is necessary. This article goes into deep detail
about the architecture of the MMO and the reasoning behind each
decision. 

 EVOLUTION OF JAVA USAGE AT NETFLIX (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Netflix heavily uses Java for its backend apps. It started with a
microservice architecture that evolved over time to incorporate new
technologies. Initially, the company employed Groovy scripts and
reactive programming for tailored API responses. It has since migrated
to GraphQL Federation for a unified API, removing the need for custom
backend layers. Netflix uses recent Java versions for performance
gains and actively uses Spring Boot. 

 AN INTERACTIVE GUIDE TO CSS CONTAINER QUERIES (26 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 When we build layouts in CSS, we always wanted a way to change a
specific UI based on the width of its container, not the viewport. CSS
container queries help us to write truly fluid components that change
based on their container size. This is a deep-dive tutorial into
container queries.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 USING GITHUB COPILOT IN YOUR IDE: TIPS, TRICKS AND BEST PRACTICES (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GitHub Copilot is more effective if you provide it with more context.
This means giving Copilot full visibility into projects, adding
top-level comments, having meaningful names, and providing example
code. Devs should also take advantage of Copilot‚Äôs built-in
features, such as its inline chat. 

 YOU DON'T HAVE TO TYPE FASTER TO TYPE FASTER (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Text expanders are a smarter alternative to learning to type faster.
You define short abbreviations for frequently used text and the tool
automatically expands them as you type. This saves time and lets you
‚Äútype faster‚Äù without actually increasing your typing speed. 

 ASKING FOR HELP IS A CORE DEVELOPER SKILL (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Developers shouldn‚Äôt let ego get in the way of asking for help.
Asking for help shows a commitment to success, both for themselves and
the product. Furthermore, getting stuck shows that there‚Äôs something
to learn. Experienced teammates can offer valuable insights and
techniques beyond just solving the immediate problem.

 DEVELOPERS WITH AI ASSISTANTS NEED TO FOLLOW THE PAIR PROGRAMMING
MODEL (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article discusses how and why pair programming is so effective,
how you can treat your AI assistant as a paired programmer, and the
best ways to make this pairing work (as well as the methods that
don‚Äôt). A good working paradigm is for the AI to focus on the syntax
and implementation, while the human focuses on the big picture and
provides instant code review. This can reduce the feedback window
between code and code review to minutes, allowing you to iterate and
elaborate on ideas without futzing about with semicolons and type
definitions. 

 WHEN WILL THE GENAI BUBBLE BURST? (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Generative AI bubble might be unsustainable. Despite significant
advancements in the space, there are still core issues like
hallucinations and security risks, and revenue generation remains
disproportionately low. If no groundbreaking solution emerges to
address these problems and justify the high costs by the end of 2024,
the bubble may begin to burst.
