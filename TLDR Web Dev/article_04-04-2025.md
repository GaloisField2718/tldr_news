ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE FIFTH KIND OF OPTIMISATION (20 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Parallelization is an optimization method that uses multiple CPU
cores for simultaneous calculations. Modern multicore CPUs and
advancements in languages like Rust have made parallel programming
much more accessible and reliable. For example, Rust's Send and Sync
traits allow for safe data sharing between threads, preventing common
multi-threading errors. 

 OVERENGINEERED ANCHOR LINKS (17 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anchor links often have an issue of not scrolling to the correct
section on a site, especially for headings near the bottom of the
page. This article goes over solutions, starting with simple fixes
like adding extra padding or shifting the trigger line. The final
solution fixes anchor link positioning by minimizing the mean squared
error (MSE) while still keeping relative section spacing. 

 ENGINEERING A TRACE DETAILS PAGE THAT HANDLES A MILLION SPANS (11
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 It's a challenge to visualize traces with millions of spans in a
browser without performance issues. However, Signoz was able to do so
by using virtualization to only render spans within the user's
viewport, optimizing database queries for fast data retrieval, and
flattening the hierarchical trace data using a pre-order traversal for
efficient pagination. It also added smart windowing, dynamically
adjusting the data based on user interactions to provide a smoother
debugging experience by only loading relevant spans.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 IN RETROSPECT, DEVOPS WAS A BAD IDEA (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The main goal of DevOps was to allow devs to manage their code
through production, but formalizing this into "DevOps teams"
backfired. This shift isolated DevOps engineers from product teams,
recreating the operational silos that DevOps sought to eliminate. 

 SENIOR DEVELOPER SKILLS IN THE AI AGE: LEVERAGING EXPERIENCE FOR
BETTER RESULTS (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Senior devs are the best positioned to take advantage of AI coding
tools. AI coding agents are like knowledgeable junior developers who
still need strategic guidance. Successful AI collaboration means
having well-structured requirements, tool-based guard rails, and
file-based keyframing. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GITMCP (WEBSITE) [9] 

 GitMCP provides instant AI context for GitHub repositories by
creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that AI assistants can
use to understand code and documentation. Use it quickly by replacing
"github.com" or "github.io" in the URL with "gitmcp.io". 

 HEADLAMP (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Headlamp is an easy-to-use and extensible Kubernetes web UI. It
provides a vendor-independent, multi-cluster Kubernetes interface with
features like resource management, logs, interactive actions, and
role-based access control.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF MICROSOFT (92 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 "Source Code," a memoir by Bill Gates, reflects on his childhood, the
early days of Microsoft, and the influences that shaped his life. He
credits a lot of his success with Microsoft to good teachers early on,
along with having early experiences with computers and programming.
Now, he's focused mostly on philanthropy to combat diseases, address
climate change, and improve education. 

 AI CHEATS: WHY YOU DIDN'T NOTICE YOUR TEAMMATE WAS CHEATING (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Video game cheats have evolved from colorbots to AI-powered aim
assist. Colorbots read enemy positions from the screen based on color,
but AI has surpassed this methodology. Newer AI cheats analyze screen
captures to identify enemies and operate on a separate PC to evade
anti-cheat detection, making them difficult to detect even while
spectating. 

 AI 2027 (37 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This document predicts the creation of capable AI agents that result
in a superhuman AI researcher over time. It predicts increasing
competition between the US and China, with stolen AI models and
geopolitical tensions rising. There are also concerns about AI
misalignment, job displacement, and national security, which may lead
to increased government oversight and public backlash.

QUICK LINKS

 WHY WE MOVED OFF NEXT.JS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Documenso switched from Next.js to React Router and Vite due to
growing pains with Next.js's newer features, which included debugging
and build issues, along with slow hot module reloading. 

 HOW TO MAKE YOUR OPEN SOURCE POPULAR (22 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Open source repos get popular through good documentation, iterative
promotion, and by having a good developer experience. 

 REACT ARCHITECTURE TRADEOFFS: SPA, SSR, OR RSC (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The traditional React Single Page App (SPA) approach requires devs to
manually handle routing, data fetching, and architecture, while modern
React frameworks using Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and React Server
Components (RSC) have better performance, SEO, and a better dev
experience. 

 JUST WRITE A TEST FOR IT (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Rust's ecosystem and tooling allowed this developer to easily create
a test that prevents a specific type of database migration error in
the `bors` project.
