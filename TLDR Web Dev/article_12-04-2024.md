 THE DEVELOPER'S GUIDE TO USER MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [3] 

 Today, even smaller startups are demanding auth features like SSO
that used to be the purview of the Fortune 500.

This developer resource by WorkOS [3] covers the essentials of modern
day user management ‚Äî from 101 topics to more advanced concepts:

 	* SSO, MFA, and sessions
 	* Bot policies, org auth policies, and UI considerations
 	* Identity linking, email verification, and just-in-time
provisioning

 WEEKEND MAINTENANCE KICKS AN ITALIAN BANK OFFLINE FOR DAYS (6 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Italian bank Sella has been offline for days after a weekend system
update caused a database problem. It is working with Oracle to resolve
the unexpected issue. The extended downtime shows the importance of
having a good backup strategy. While "blackout" windows for
maintenance are common in banking, they might inadvertently lead to
weaker engineering practices compared to industries that require
zero-downtime migrations. 

 THE UX OF UUIDS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Unique identifiers (UUIDs) in their standard form can be unfriendly
to users. To improve their UX for users, developers can remove hyphens
to allow for easy double-click copying. They can also add prefixes
(e.g., "prod_" or "test_") to distinguish between environments and
resources. Developers should consider encoding UUIDs in base58 for
shorter IDs. 

 THE GUIDE TO GIT I NEVER HAD (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This guide goes over Git, from key terms to important commands and
workflows. It covers branches, commits, and HEAD, along with workflows
like forking, feature branches, and more.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 FIXING ALL THE BUGS WON'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Quality improvement programs often yield initial success as obvious
flaws ("special causes") are fixed. However, teams will eventually
reach a plateau because systemic issues aren't addressed. This means
not just fixing bugs, but also tackling architectural problems like
geographic distribution, resource allocation, data efficiency, and
problematic access patterns. 

 ARE MORE DEVELOPERS BURNING OUT? OR AM I JUST SEEING THINGS (REDDIT
THREAD) [8] 

 Developers are burning out for various reasons, including layoffs,
decisions made by non-technical executives, and a tough hiring market.
The hiring market is now an ‚Äúemployer's market‚Äù, which means that
companies have more power over employees and so can dictate working
hours, promotions (or lack thereof), and other parts of work to their
own benefit. 

 THE 2024 BREAKING INTO DATA ENGINEERING ROADMAP (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To land a data engineering job in 2024, you'll need a skillset that
includes SQL knowledge, development skills in Python or Scala, and
ideally expertise in distributed compute frameworks like Spark,
Snowflake, or BigQuery. Aspiring data engineers should make sure they
know how to model data properly and have at least one compelling
portfolio project that showcases all of these skills.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NEW FLOW LANGUAGE FEATURES FOR REACT (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Flow, a type checker for JavaScript, now offers dedicated syntax for
React components and hooks to improve the developer experience. It now
replaces traditional React function syntax with component syntax and
enforces React best practices, like making props read-only. It also
supports hooks and their corresponding rules. 

 MADGE (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Madge is a development tool that helps visualize and manage module
dependencies for JavaScript and CSS projects. It supports several
module types and CSS preprocessors. Madge can detect circular
dependencies and create visual graphs of project structures. The tool
is useful for developers looking to optimize their codebase and
maintain clear dependencies.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY AREN'T MORE COMPANIES LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC WHEN IT COMES TO HIRING?
(REDDIT THREAD) [12] 

 Large companies (like FAANG) have the resources to offer new hires
extended onboarding periods (3-6 months), allowing flexibility in the
languages that a new hire knows. In contrast, startups need immediate
productivity from new hires since they run lean. 

 FROM THE 80'S TO 2024 - HOW CI TESTS WERE INVENTED AND OPTIMIZED (11
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Over the last few decades, software testing has evolved from slow
manual reviews to automated testing of every code change. Initially
focused on finding errors, testing now emphasizes speed and efficiency
through vertical scaling (faster machines), parallelization (running
tests simultaneously), and caching (avoiding rework). Teams are able
to optimize testing further by batching changes in merge queues,
testing stacked PRs together, and using AI code review to detect
potential errors. 

 HOW I DISCOVERED A 9.8 CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY IN ZEROMQ WITH
MOSTLY PURE LUCK AND MY TWO CENTS ABOUT XZ BACKDOOR (13 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 While working on a project, this developer accidentally discovered a
serious security flaw in the ZeroMQ library. The flaw was serious and
reminded them of the recent infamous xz backdoor incident. Both flaws
could've been prevented. Open-source contributors and maintainers
should prioritize focused features and utilize tools like Valgrind to
prevent similar security risks.

 OUR RESPONSE TO HASHICORP'S CEASE AND DESIST LETTER (1 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 HashiCorp claims OpenTofu's "removed" block infringes its copyright,
but OpenTofu refutes this, citing evidence that the code originated
from an MPL-2.0 licensed project and that Hashicorp's own
implementation appears to be derived from the same source. 

 DEMYSTIFYING THE SHADOW DOM (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Shadow DOM is a hidden portion of the regular DOM and is ideal
for browser extensions, widgets, and component libraries. 

 TRANSITIONING FROM REACT TO SVELTE: GUIDE FOR FRONTEND DEVELOPERS (20
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A guide for developers who are moving from React to Svelte that
covers differences in reactivity, component lifecycle, and state
management, providing code examples along the way. 

 TOP OPEN-SOURCE AI AND ML TOOLS FOR 2023-2024 (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 An overview of various AI/ML tools, including general frameworks like
TensorFlow, tools optimized for local use such as GPT4ALL, and AI
development kits like the Unity ML Agents Toolkit.
