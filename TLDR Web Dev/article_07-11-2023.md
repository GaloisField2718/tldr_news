ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW DISCORD CAN SERVE MILLIONS OF USERS FROM A SINGLE SERVER (13
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Discord handles millions of users on its servers by optimizing its
system using technologies like BEAM (Erlang Virtual Machine) and
Elixir. BEAM's lightweight processes and message-passing capabilities
enable high concurrency, while Elixir simplifies Erlang's syntax.
Discord optimized its fanout system for updates by using Elixir
processes to help manage servers and user clients. 

 BETTER DYNAMIC THEMES IN TAILWIND WITH OKLCH COLOR MAGIC (13 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Tailwind CSS is popular due to its low bundle size, high performance,
built-in code splitting, and improved readability due to classes being
embedded in markup. This article particularly focuses on the color
management system in Tailwind CSS and the need for dynamic themes,
allowing users to choose interface colors. It explains the challenges
of implementing dynamic themes, especially regarding color perception,
and introduces the OKLCH color space as a solution. It also outlines
steps for integrating dynamic colors with Tailwind CSS, creating
semantic classes, and managing user color choices through methods like
local storage. 

 HOW DOORDASH STANDARDIZED AND IMPROVED MICROSERVICES CACHING (12
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 DoorDash streamlined microservices caching by developing a Kotlin
library that standardizes caching across multiple microservices. The
library enhances performance and resolves caching issues like cache
staleness and heavy dependency on Redis. This standardized caching
allows teams to focus more on their own business logic and less on the
overall performance of the caching.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 NURTURING A NONLINEAR CAREER (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 We tend to think about our careers as being straightforward,
following a laid-out path of milestones and achievements. But in
reality, a person‚Äôs career can take a nonlinear route which might
include changing titles or even industries. This article lays out a
new way to look at a nonlinear career that can empower people with
this background. 

 HOW TO CONVINCE YOUR MANAGEMENT TO REFACTOR SOFTWARE (4 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Refactoring code in a development team can be explained in economic
terms to non-technical managers. To encourage management to allow
developers time to refactor a codebase, the article suggests providing
answers to questions such as how much longer future projects will take
without refactoring, the potential cost savings from refactoring, and
what features may become impossible without it. The article also
recommends presenting multiple options for refactoring, including
"Monster refactoring," "Refactor as you go," and "Slice and dice."

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 STOP RELEASING BUGS WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 QA Wolf [10] offers a new, cost-effective approach to getting 80%
test coverage in just 4 months. They will build and maintain your test
suite in Playwright (no more false positives or flaky tests) and
provide unlimited parallel test runs [10] on their infrastructure. QA
Wolf has case studies of customers saving $200k+/year in QA
engineering and infrastructure costs, so it's worth checking them out
[10] if you're looking to improve your test coverage. 

 ANNOUNCING ANGULAR.DEV (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 With the release of Angular v17 approaching, Angular has launched
Angular.dev as the new home for Angular development, offering updated
tutorials, documentation, and guidance for developers. The site
introduces embedded tutorials that enable learning Angular concepts
directly in the browser with side-by-side code examples. It has been
open-sourced, allowing developers to contribute and learn from the
repository. 

 NEW MODELS AND DEVELOPER PRODUCTS ANNOUNCED AT DEVDAY (9 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 OpenAI has announced several updates and improvements to its
platform, including the launch of GPT-4 Turbo, a more capable and
cost-effective model with a 128K context window. They have also
introduced the Assistants API, allowing developers to create AI apps
with specific goals and capabilities. Other enhancements include
better function calling, improved instruction following, JSON mode,
and reproducible outputs. 

 REACTIME (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Reactime is a Chrome developer tool available as open-source,
designed for time travel debugging and performance monitoring in React
applications. With Reactime, developers can capture snapshots of their
application's state, navigate between and examine these snapshots, and
track performance metrics, including component render time and
frequency.

 WHY CITIES: SKYLINES 2 PERFORMS POORLY (30 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article delves into the technical challenges and issues faced by
the game "Cities: Skylines 2." The game's heavy GPU usage is due to
the excessive rendering of unnecessary geometry, which is caused by a
lack of simplified LOD variants for many of the game's meshes and an
apparently untuned culling implementation. The developers likely
initially adopted Unity's new technologies like DOTS but had to
implement custom solutions for various aspects of the game due to
limitations in Unity's integration and technical challenges. 

 AN INTRO TO BUILDING GAME UIS WITH REACT (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article discusses the use of React for building game UIs using
Unity. It presents two approaches to using React in Unity: embedding a
browser or WebView and a browser-less approach that interprets
JavaScript into native game engine UI code. It also outlines a
workflow for coordinating interactions between the browser and Unity
using state machines.
