 HOW GITHUB‚ÄôS DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE TEAM IMPROVED INNERLOOP
DEVELOPMENT (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Integration testing in distributed or microservice systems with
multiple teams working on different services can be very challenging.
GitHub addresses this with Hubber Codespace (HCS), a tool that allows
developers to locally set up GitHub's entire distributed ecosystem
with a few lines of config change or a query call. This post details
how GitHub arrived at HCS as a solution over other possible solutions
and presents a first-hand look at how GitHub's developer-first mindset
helped it deliver the best tool for devs to ship code quickly and
safely in a distributed environment. 

 A GUIDE TO ENABLING PARTIAL PRE-RENDERING IN NEXT.JS (9 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Partial pre-rendering in Next.js 14 lets you control which parts of a
page are pre-rendered. Next.js enables the pre-rendering of pages
containing dynamic data during the build time with incremental static
regeneration. This article explores how the partial pre-rendering
feature works and how it can be used in Next.js applications.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SOME THOUGHTS ON INTERVIEWING (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The current job market has increased competition and longer job
search periods compared to a few years ago. Many qualified candidates
have opted for alternative paths, such as travel or self-employment,
to navigate the challenging job market. This post discusses the
exhaustion that can come from conducting interviews, emphasizing the
importance of kindness and respect in the hiring process. 

 BECOMING AN ENGINEERING MANAGER - IS IT FOR YOU? (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Senior engineers often face the decision to go into management or
continue growing as IC. This post offers a quick 5-question quiz to
find out if engineering management is for you. Engineering management
is not always necessary in order to progress in one‚Äôs career as many
companies offer tech lead roles and similar positions as an
alternative for ICs.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 KEYV (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Keyv is a library that abstracts the concept of key-value storage,
allowing you to easily use a memory-based store (by default) or, if
you need persistence, Redis, SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, Mongo, or even a
tiered approach. 

 FABRIC (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Fabric helps people integrate AI into their lives. It can help
extract the most interesting parts of podcasts and YouTube videos,
summarize academic papers, create AI art prompts for a piece of
writing, and more.

 HOW HARD IS IT TO CHEAT WITH CHATGPT IN TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS? WE RAN
AN EXPERIMENT (21 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In a study testing the use of ChatGPT in technical interviews, three
groups of interviewers asked different types of questions: verbatim
LeetCode questions, modified LeetCode questions, and custom questions.
The results showed that candidates using ChatGPT had higher pass rates
when facing verbatim questions, indicating potential cheating.
However, interviewers did not suspect cheating. Custom questions were
recommended as a way to improve the interview process and filter out
candidates relying on memorized solutions. 

 RESEARCHERS SAY GENERATIVE AI ISN'T REPLACING DEVS ANY TIME SOON (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A study conducted by AI researchers from Princeton and the University
of Chicago suggests that LLMs are far from being capable of solving
common software engineering problems. The study evaluated the
performance of various LLMs on over 2,300 real GitHub issues and found
that they could only solve such problems correctly in a very small
percentage of cases, with the most advanced models achieving only 4.8%
success. LLMs often struggle with the complexity and context of
real-world software engineering tasks. 

 SPATIAL COMPUTING (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The success of interfaces like the Macintosh GUI and iPhone's
touchscreen interface is rooted in leveraging human's innate spatial
and kinesthetic skills. Apple's new "spatial computer," the Vision
Pro, aims to create a 3D spatial world for users, but its interaction
model may not be as effective compared to touch interfaces. This could
lead to issues with adoption.

 MODERN JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY STARTER (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A walkthrough of how to create and package a library, publish a
package, add testing, and automatically publish to the NPM registry.
The automatic publish uses a CI/CD pipeline from GitHub actions. The
article also explains modern NPM features like Provenance and Secrets.


 LINUS TORVALDS FLAMES GOOGLE KERNEL CONTRIBUTOR OVER FILESYSTEM
SUGGESTION (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, sent an angry
message to a kernel contributor who works at Google over a filesystem
suggestion that he disagrees with. 

 10 GOOD CODING PRINCIPLES TO IMPROVE CODE QUALITY (X POST) [16] 

 To increase code quality, one should follow code specs, add
documentation and comments, increase robustness, follow design
principles, make testing easy, and reduce global dependencies.
