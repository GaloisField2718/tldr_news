ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY GOOGLE SHEETS PORTED ITS CALCULATION WORKER FROM JAVASCRIPT TO
WASMGC (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google Sheets initially used a Java-based calculation engine, but
later switched to JavaScript for browser-based calculations. Due to
performance limitations of JavaScript compared to Java, Google used
WasmGC, an extension to WebAssembly that allows for efficient
compilation of garbage-collected languages like Java. The initial
prototype was slower than JavaScript, but optimizations like
replicating JVM/V8 optimizations, using browser APIs, and making code
more platform-agnostic resulted in huge performance improvements. 

 USING SHORT LIVED POSTGRES SERVERS FOR TESTING (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Postgres installations consist of binaries and a data directory,
allowing for easy setup of multiple instances on a server. A new
instance can be created by setting up a new data directory and using
the "pg_ctl" command. Existing data can be quickly populated into a
new instance by cloning from a stable instance using the
"pg_basebackup" command. 

 GRPC: THE BAD PARTS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework that has been successful but
also has its downsides. It has a steep learning curve due to
non-standard terms and complex implementations, compatibility issues
with the web, lack of standardized JSON mapping initially, and finite
message sizes requiring custom chunking for large files.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 A RANT ABOUT FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Front-end development has become unnecessarily complex due to poor
choices, such as over-reliance on JavaScript frameworks and ignoring
fundamental principles like content importance and CSS capabilities.
This complexity leads to frustration and inefficiency. Developers
should prioritize simplicity. 

 A DEV'S THOUGHTS ON DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The software development process consists of two nested loops: an
outer loop that aligns with the SDLC and an inner loop of reading,
writing, and running code. The inner loop is crucial for productivity
and achieving flow state, but is often disrupted by internal and
external context switches. Developer productivity should be measured
by the frequency of inner loop iterations rather than lines of code or
commits.

 GEMMA 2 IS NOW AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS AND DEVELOPERS (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Google DeepMind has released Gemma 2, a family of high-performing and
efficient open models for various AI tasks. Gemma 2 is designed to run
efficiently on a single GPU or TPU host, and it is compatible with
major AI frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers, JAX, PyTorch, and
TensorFlow. It is available in 9 billion and 27 billion parameter
sizes. 

 AI CSS ANIMATIONS (WEBSITE) [11] 

 This is an AI tool that creates CSS animations. You can describe the
animation you want and the tool will generate the code. You can also
edit the animation after it is created. 

 SUPERMEMORY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Supermemory is like ChatGPT for your bookmarks. You can import tweets
or save websites and content using the Chrome extension and chat with
your bookmarks.

 RABBIT DATA BREACH: ALL R1 RESPONSES EVER GIVEN CAN BE DOWNLOADED (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 On May 16, 2024, the rabbitude team discovered several hardcoded API
keys in the Rabbit r1 codebase, allowing them to access and manipulate
user data. Rabbit Inc. has been aware of this security breach for a
month but has not taken any action to mitigate the risk. The Rabbit r1
is a ChatGPT-based personal assistant device. 

 EXPLAINING GENERATIVE LANGUAGE MODELS TO (ALMOST) ANYONE (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Generative language models are based on the transformer architecture,
a neural network that takes embedded tokens as input and transforms
them through masked self-attention and feed-forward operations. These
models are pretrained using self-supervised learning with the goal of
predicting the next token in a sequence. After pretraining, the
alignment process teaches the model to generate text that aligns with
human desires by using techniques like supervised finetuning and
reinforcement learning from human feedback. 

 FINDING GPT-4'S MISTAKES WITH GPT-4 (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI developed CriticGPT, a model based on GPT-4, to identify
errors in ChatGPT's code output, and found it improves human trainers'
ability to spot mistakes during the reinforcement learning process.
CriticGPT was trained using RLHF on ChatGPT answers containing errors.
It can generate longer, more comprehensive critiques by utilizing
additional test-time search against the critique reward model.

 BALANCING OLD TRICKS WITH NEW FEATS: AI-POWERED CONVERSION FROM
ENZYME TO REACT TESTING LIBRARY AT SLACK (16 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Slack transitioned from Enzyme to React Testing Library (RTL) due to
the lack of support for React 18 by Enzyme, converting over 15,000
tests using a hybrid approach that combined Abstract Syntax Tree
transformations and LLMs. 

 WEB WORKERS, COMLINK, VITE, AND TANSTACK QUERY (6 MINUTE READ) [18]
