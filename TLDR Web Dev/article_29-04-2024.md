ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 A BRIEF HISTORY OF WEB DEVELOPMENT. AND WHY YOUR FRAMEWORK DOESN'T
MATTER (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Web development started with simple HTML and CSS. Eventually,
client-side JavaScript allowed for more dynamic websites. The need for
SEO and performance led to the creation of server-side rendering and
frameworks like Next.js. JavaScript's shortcomings led to TypeScript
and Svelte. At the end of the day, the core goal of all these
evolutions was to create enjoyable user experiences, so the tools
being used don't matter much. 

 HIDDEN GEMS OF TAILWIND CSS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tailwind CSS has some lesser-known features that can make developing
web UIs easier. This article goes over a couple of them, such as using
gap-* to add space between elements, accent-* utilities to change the
color of checkboxes/radio buttons, and peer-* modifiers to style
elements based on the state of sibling elements. 

 SPEEDING UP C++ BUILD TIMES (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 C++ build times at Figma were getting so long that it was reducing
dev productivity. Figma was able to reduce build times by 50% by using
libclang's Python bindings to identify and remove unnecessary header
file inclusions, reducing the amount of code the compiler needs to
process. It also used a tool to track and address build time
regressions over time and ‚Äúfwd.h‚Äù files to centralize forward
declarations within code directories.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WE WERE WRONG, WE NEED A DATABASE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This author built a web game called "Binary Duel" using only Go and
claimed that features like a cache, queue, and database weren't
necessary. However, he admitted that his initial claim was premature
and wrong. For better user retention, he decided to add features like
a database, login, leaderboard, and ranking system, using Go to
implement solutions like in-memory caching and bulk database writes
efficiently. 

 WHY READING WHITEPAPERS TAKES YOUR CAREER TO THE NEXT LEVEL (AND HOW
TO DO IT) (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Reading academic whitepapers can help engineers build a strong
foundation of technical expertise and keep up with industry trends. To
get the most out of reading them, devs should use a three-step process
to internalize them: first do a high-level skim of the paper, then go
through it in a slower, detailed manner, and lastly, write down your
takeaways to fully internalize your understanding.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE MADE ME RUIN A PERFECTLY GOOD WEBSITE: A CASE STUDY ON THE
AI-GENERATED INTERNET (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 To monetize their website, this author reluctantly added low-quality
content to their site to appeal to Google's AdSense approval process.
They used AI-generated recipes, poetry, riddles, and a fictional blog
to have more content on their site to get through the process
successfully. Ironically, despite the site's original high quality,
this absurdly bad content allowed them to gain Google's approval to
display ads. 

 THE WALLS OF APPLE'S GARDEN ARE TUMBLING DOWN (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Apple's strategy of locking users into its ecosystem with exclusive
features and tight control over the App Store is facing external
pressures through antitrust lawsuits, legislation, and developer
dissatisfaction. Apple is being forced to slowly make concessions,
such as the allowance of third-party app stores following European
regulation.
