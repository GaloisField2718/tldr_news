ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE FUTURE OF REACT NATIVE GRAPHICS: WEBGPU, SKIA, AND BEYOND (8
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 React Native is embracing WebGPU and improving Skia for improved
graphics capabilities. WebGPU has a unified backend, giving access to
general-purpose GPU computing for tasks like machine learning with
TensorFlow.js. This integration allows easy use of libraries like
Three.js and React Three Fiber and makes shader development through
TSL easier. 

 FINDING DEAD WEBSITES (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Marginalia Search implemented a system to detect website availability
and big changes, including ownership transfers and domain parking,
using primarily HTTP HEAD requests and DNS queries. The system
maintains live data, such as website status and security posture, and
historical event data, storing changes as immutable JSON records. The
challenges of implementing this system included scheduling tasks
efficiently, handling per-domain request limits, and dealing with the
complexities of HTTPS certificate validation.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 IN PRAISE OF “NORMAL” ENGINEERS (16 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Team productivity matters more than individual brilliance. Good teams
have environments where "normal" engineers can thrive and consistently
deliver value. This means shrinking deploy cycles, facilitating easy
rollbacks, providing guardrails, and investing in observability and
internal tooling. 

 OPEN SOURCE CAN'T COORDINATE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There's a lack of a unified API for Linux desktop programs, leading
to fragmentation and difficulty in maintaining a consistent experience
across different distributions like NixOS. This lack of coordination
is due to the decentralized nature of open-source development, which
is unlike the centralized control of Windows and macOS. 

 WE CAN JUST MEASURE THINGS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Agents should be used to objectively measure code quality and
developer experience. This means subjecting agents to tasks and
quantifying their struggles to identify issues with test coverage,
error reporting, ecosystem stability, and development environments.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CLAUDE CODE USAGE MONITOR (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 The Claude Code Usage Monitor is a real-time terminal tool for
tracking token usage with Claude AI. It has progress bars, smart
predictions, and auto-detection of limits. The tool supports different
usage plans (Pro, Max5, and Max20) and allows customization of reset
times and timezones for accurate monitoring. 

 ENRICHMCP (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 EnrichMCP is a Python framework that serves as an ORM for AI agents.
It automatically generates typed tools from data models, handles
relationships between entities, provides schema discovery, and
validates inputs/outputs with Pydantic models. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW OPENELECTIONS USES LLMS (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenElections uses Google Gemini to convert image-based PDF election
results into CSV files. Gemini's accuracy and large context window are
great for processing complex and large PDFs. While Gemini is good at
extracting data, it still sometimes needs adjustments for formatting
inconsistencies, large documents, and complex layouts. 

 AI SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT: LLM → RAG → AI WORKFLOW → AI AGENT (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI systems have progressed from basic LLMs to RAG, then to AI
Workflows, and finally to more complex AI Agents. AI Workflows
automate business processes through tool use and predefined paths, and
AI Agents are autonomous systems that independently reason, make
decisions, and initiate workflows. 

 WHAT WOULD A KUBERNETES 2.0 LOOK LIKE (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A hypothetical "Kubernetes 2.0" would replace YAML with HCL for
configuration, allow for alternative backends to etcd, and create a
native package manager to address the issues with Helm. IPv6 would be
the default networking protocol.

QUICK LINKS

 BENTO (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Bento is a portable, keyboard-based computer designed for use with
external displays like XR headsets. 

 PUBLIC/PROTECTED/PRIVATE IS AN UNNECESSARY FEATURE (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Access modifiers like public, protected, and private are a redundant
feature in object-oriented programming because they duplicate the
interface-defining capabilities already provided by virtual methods
and subtyping. 

 WRITING TOY SOFTWARE IS A JOY (13 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Writing toy programs is valuable because it helps with understanding,
creativity, and practical knowledge. 

 INFINITE MAC OS X (15 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Infinite Mac now supports running early Mac OS X versions (10.1 and
10.3 being the most stable) through PearPC emulation.
