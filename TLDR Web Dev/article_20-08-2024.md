 STRIPE'S MONOREPO DEVELOPER ENVIRONMENT (20 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The developer environment at Stripe has tools and infrastructure
built to support a large Ruby monorepo. Code is run on cloud-based
devboxes instead of local machines. The company's team team invested
heavily in automated code synchronization and a unified command-line
tool called "pay" to manage devbox interactions. This post discusses
the importance of organizational scale and codebase characteristics in
shaping the design and success of the developer tooling. 

 AN APPROACH TO OPTIMIZING TYPESCRIPT TYPE CHECKING PERFORMANCE (16
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 You can optimize TypeScript's type-checking performance by first
diagnosing inefficiencies using tools like --extendedDiagnostics,
--generateTrace, and benchmarking libraries. You should iteratively
test hypotheses by grouping related operators and refining overload
order. 

 PARSING PROTOBUF AT 2+GB/S: HOW I LEARNED TO LOVE TAIL CALLS IN C (16
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This blog post discusses a novel technique for optimizing interpreter
loops and protobuf parsing using tail calls in C. The author
discovered that by utilizing the `[[clang::musttail]]` attribute, they
got a huge performance boost, achieving protobuf parsing speeds
exceeding 2 GB/s. The key benefit of tail calls is the elimination of
function call overhead, resulting in more efficient control flow and
reduced stack usage.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GOOD REFACTORING VS BAD REFACTORING (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Good code refactoring is incremental and preserves functionality
while avoiding any new unnecessary complexity. Bad refactoring
practices include drastic style changes, unnecessary abstractions,
inconsistency in code patterns, refactoring without fully
understanding the existing code, and ignoring the business context. 

 TIPS FROM 8 MONTHS OF TANSTACK/ROUTER IN PRODUCTION (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 After using TanStack Router in production for eight months, this
author believes in organizing code into vertical modules, using
loaders for page-level data and suspense queries for
component-specific data, and avoiding premature code generalization.
He promotes a ‚Äúgo gardening approach‚Äù that involves abstracting
code only when clear patterns show up. 

 TYPES -> SETS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 You can think about TypeScript's type system as a functional
programming language that operates over sets of values. By imagining
types as sets of all possible values they can construct, it becomes
easier to reason about features like intersections, unions, and type
mappings.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ECMASCRIPT SAFE ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR PROPOSAL (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This proposal introduces the ?= operator, which makes error handling
easier by transforming function results into a [error, result] tuple.
It also supports recursive handling of promises and objects
implementing Symbol.result, making error checking streamlined across
various JavaScript APIs. 

 LLMS KNOW MORE THAN WHAT THEY SAY (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 An approach called Latent Space Readout (LSR) can improve the
accuracy of AI application evals. LSR uses interpretability research
by projecting evaluation model activations onto meaningful linear
directions, which makes it more sample efficient than fine-tuning.
This means that much less human feedback is required for these evals
to be more accurate. 

 THE GIGANTIC AND UNREGULATED POWER PLANTS IN THE CLOUD (12 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 There's a dangerous lack of regulation for cloud-based management
platforms controlling millions of solar panels across Europe. These
platforms, mostly run by companies outside of Europe, have the power
to shut down vast amounts of power, potentially causing grid collapse.
While individual solar panels pose little threat, their concentrated
control creates a huge risk, especially due to recent hacking
attempts.

 A security researcher found that an app leaked sensitive user data
due to client-side filtering, including preferred genders,
sexualities, and relationship situations, through its GraphQL API. 

 SOURCEGRAPH WENT DARK (8 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Eric Fritz, a former Sourcegraph engineer, explains how he preserved
links to Sourcegraph's codebase after a repository went private by
creating a fork, scraping relevant commits, and rewriting all
references to his fork.
