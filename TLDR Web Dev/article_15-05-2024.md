 HOW WE SAVED 10S OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS DEPLOYING LOW COST OPEN
SOURCE AI TECHNOLOGIES AT SCALE WITH KUBERNETES (14 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This author successfully replaced OpenAI's API with an open-source
alternative to reduce the cost of running large-scale AI applications.
They tried using Ollama on a local machine to generate text summaries,
but limitations with concurrent processing led to them using vLLM (a
fast inference runner). To handle large volumes of requests, the
author used a Kubernetes cluster to deploy and load balance vLLM. 

 CACHING IN: DEFINING, OPTIMIZING, AND INVALIDATING YOUR CACHE (11
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Caches need to be maintained and updated. The process of cache
invalidation can be challenging due to factors like thundering herds
(a sudden surge of requests) and cache inconsistency (different parts
of the data updating at different times). To handle cache invalidation
properly, it's important to prioritize using a robust invalidation
protocol and manage data dependencies. 

 DATA FETCHING PATTERNS IN SINGLE-PAGE APPLICATIONS (25 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The Asynchronous State Handler pattern improves UX in web apps by
decoupling data fetching from the UI. It wraps asynchronous queries
with meta-queries that track the status (loading, success, error) of
the data fetching process. This allows the UI to react dynamically to
these states, displaying loading indicators or error messages when
needed. The pattern can be implemented in React using a custom hook.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 10 LESSONS FROM 12 YEARS AT GOOGLE (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Over a 12-year career at Google, Addy Osmani learned to put users
first, collaborate well by actively sharing knowledge, and embrace
lifelong learning. He encourages readers to just get started and
iterate rather than trying to strive for perfection. 

 COMMUNICATE LIKE A SENIOR: USE CLEAR DELTAS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Communicating in clear deltas (i.e., quantifying before and after
states) is a great way to get your point across effectively. For
example, in performance reviews, rather than vague statements like
"improved performance," specify the percentage reduction in page load
time and its impact on key metrics like user engagement. Convincing
others to adopt your ideas is easier when you quantify the current
problem and the expected improvement from your proposed solution.

 WHY DO ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF GENAI PROJECTS ACTUALLY MAKE IT
INTO PRODUCTION? (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Most generative AI projects fail to reach production or deliver
significant revenue. Successful GenAI projects prioritize
understanding business problems before selecting tools, recognize
GenAI is part of a larger tech stack, keep humans involved to guide
AI, and rely on trustworthy, traceable data for the best results.
