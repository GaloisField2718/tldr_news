 THE EVOLVING LANDSCAPE OF API PROTOCOLS IN 2023 (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 REST remains the most popular API protocol in 2023 due to its
simplicity, scalability, and web integration ease, despite a slight
decrease in usage. GraphQL is rising in adoption for its precise data
retrieval and flexible queries. Webhooks, WebSockets, and gRPC are
increasingly used too. Other protocols like MQTT, AMQP, SSE, and EDI,
each serve specific use cases, such as IoT and enterprise messaging. 

 THE WEIRDEST BUG I‚ÄôVE SEEN YET (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A problem arose where Chrome was crashing for users of Gusto‚Äôs
internal software during an on-call rotation with Gusto's internal
tools team. After ruling out the Chrome version and extensions as the
causes, a stroke of luck led to the discovery that the Grammarly
desktop app was a common factor among affected users. Further
investigation revealed that a specific GIF file in the software was
causing the crashes when Grammarly was installed. Replacing the GIF
resolved the issue, although the exact reason for the crash remains
unknown due to lack of access to Chrome and Grammarly's source codes.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 PSYCHOLOGY OF SPEED: A GUIDE TO PERCEIVED PERFORMANCE (10 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Perceived performance focuses on how users feel about the speed and
responsiveness of a website or app, rather than just relying on
metric-driven performance. This subjective perception is influenced by
various factors, including the user's environment, device, network,
and emotional state, making it difficult to quantify. Perceived
performance can be enhanced by smartly communicating status and
progress, keeping users engaged during load times, avoiding sudden
page movements, and preventing intensive processing. This article
teaches how to use design and psychological principles to increase
perceived performance by users. 

 WHY TYPE SAFETY IS IMPORTANT (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dynamically typed languages like JavaScript and Python are known for
their ease of learning and flexibility but can lead to quirks and
issues due to type coercion and the lack of a solid typing system.
This is why TypeScript and type hinting have gotten so popular.
Statically typed languages, with modern features like type inference,
offer strong type safety, catching errors at compile time and
providing comprehensive documentation. However, their use results in
slower development velocity and harder-to-read code.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 POWERSYNC (WEBSITE) [9] 

 PowerSync is a service that keeps backend SQL databases in sync with
on-device databases embedded in an SDK. It currently supports Postgres
and has SDKs for Flutter, React Native, and JavaScript on the web. The
SDKs operate on the client side to keep both the client-side and
server-side SQL databases in sync. Usually, the client-side database
is a SQLite database. 

 ANIMOTION (WEBSITE) [10] 

 Animotion lets you create CSS animations visually by dragging,
resizing, rotating, clipping, and more. It includes a keyframes
editor, a collection of ready-to-use animations, and 29 built-in
easings.

 WHY WE USE AWS INSTEAD OF VERCEL TO HOST OUR NEXT.JS APP (7 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 This article explains Graphite‚Äôs journey from a simple single-page
app (SPA) architecture to the adoption of a more robust solution. It
explains why the company considered various hosting options, the
technical considerations that guided the decision, and why it
ultimately chose to host its Next.js web application on ECS.
Graphite‚Äôs decision to containerize its application with AWS ECS
aligned with its goal of maintaining performance standards and cost
efficiency within its AWS Virtual Private Cloud. 

 HOW TO ACCELERATE DEVELOPMENT VELOCITY IN THE GENAI ERA? BUILD A
GENOS (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Intuit has embraced generative AI, developing various applications
like Intuit Assist, which aids small business owners, marketers, and
others in making informed decisions. The company also created GenOS,
an operating system that enables product teams to integrate generative
AI into their applications easily. GenOS contains various components
that Intuit built, such as GenStudio for experimentation, GenUX for UI
tools, and GenRuntime for hosting AI capabilities. 

 WRITING JAVASCRIPT WITHOUT A BUILD SYSTEM (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This author discusses their preference for not using a build system
in small frontend JavaScript projects. They give examples of how
simple it is to work without a build system, using Vue 3 directly with
script tags, and express frustration that some libraries, like
CodeMirror 6 and Tailwind 3, now require a build system. Build
systems, like webpack, rollup, esbuild, parcel, or vite, are used to
translate and optimize JavaScript or TypeScript code for web
deployment, but can be overkill for small projects.

 PREVENTING SCROLL ‚ÄúBOUNCE‚Äù WITH CSS (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 When you scroll rapidly to the top or bottom of a webpage you might
notice a ‚Äúbounce‚Äù effect. To prevent this with CSS, you can add
the overscroll-behavior property on the document root to none. 

 CODE IS RUN MORE THAN READ (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Prioritizing user needs and operational aspects is more important
than developer preferences in software development.
