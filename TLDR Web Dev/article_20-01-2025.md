 👋 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage — and staying there
— is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's AI-native service [5] gets engineering teams to 80%
automated end-to-end test coverage [6] and helps them SHIP 5X FASTER
by reducing QA cycles from hours to minutes.

QA Wolf [7] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [8] achieved
4x more test cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING A MINIMALIST DATABASE IN 3000 LINES OF CODE (7 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This article goes over how to build a simple database in about 3,000
lines of Go. By building it incrementally, it teaches core database
principles like power-loss atomicity through append-only logs,
efficient indexing with copy-on-write B+trees, and storage management
with free lists. The DB starts as a simple KV store and evolves
step-by-step to a relational database with transactions, concurrency
control, and a SQL-like query language. 

 WHY IS GIT AUTOCORRECT TOO FAST FOR FORMULA ONE DRIVERS? (5 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Git's autocorrect feature, when enabled, waits only 0.1 seconds
before executing a potentially mistyped command, a timeframe too short
for even a Formula One driver to react. This behavior stems from a
2008 patch that, jokingly, used deciseconds as the time unit. A recent
patch aims to improve this functionality by defaulting to "immediate"
execution instead of a 0.1-second delay. 

 AN ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO AMAZON VPCS (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The need for Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) arose from two main
problems: IP address conflicts between customers' on-premise and AWS
servers, and security vulnerabilities from a shared network. VPCs
solve these issues by providing each customer with an isolated private
network within AWS, preventing IP address collisions and improving
security. This isolation is achieved through a "mapping service" that
routes traffic within each VPC, effectively creating separate networks
despite instances potentially sharing IP addresses.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 PLEASE DON'T FORCE DARK MODE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Websites shouldn't force dark mode, as this can cause eye strain and
after-effects for certain people. This is usually because of high
contrast ratios between text and background in dark mode, even though
current WCAG guidelines don't address maximum contrast. Dark mode is
great in specific situations with comfortable contrast ratios, such as
OLED screens in dark rooms or well-designed code editors. 

 HOW DO INTERRUPTIONS IMPACT DIFFERENT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
ACTIVITIES? (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A study examined how interruptions affect software engineers'
productivity and stress across various coding tasks (writing,
comprehension, and review). The research revealed that interruption
impact varies depending on task complexity and the interrupter's
authority, with in-person interruptions surprisingly showing lower
physiological stress despite higher perceived stress. Perceived
stress, rather than physiological data, better predicted engineers'
actual behavior and productivity. 

 THE PC IS DEAD: IT'S TIME TO MAKE COMPUTING PERSONAL AGAIN (14 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The "personal computer" era has ended due to more tracking and
digital rights management (DRM). The current popular business models
in tech prioritize growth over useful products. Stronger privacy
legislation, Right to Repair laws, and DRM reform are needed to
restore a more personal computing experience. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CHROME 133 BETA (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Chrome 133 beta introduces several new CSS and UI features, including
the advanced attr() function, the :open pseudo-class for open
elements, and scroll state container queries for more dynamic styling.
Web API updates include Animation.overallProgress for tracking
animation progress, a DOM method for preserving element state during
moves, and energy-saving freezing of inactive tabs. 

 TIPEX (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Tipex is a customizable, high-performance rich text editor built for
Svelte using Tiptap and ProseMirror. It offers features like a
floating menu, plugin architecture, and Svelte 5 integration. 

 YEK (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 Yek is a fast, Rust-based command-line tool that chunks and
serializes text-based files from a repository or directory for LLM
consumption. It automatically prioritizes important files based on Git
history and offers configurable options for size, output, and ignore
patterns.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WASM GC ISN'T READY FOR REALTIME GRAPHICS (10 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Wasm GC (GC = Garbage Collection) has performance drawbacks for
real-time graphics programming. The core issue is the opacity of Wasm
GC heap objects to the JavaScript host, requiring byte-by-byte data
copying between Wasm and JavaScript for operations like WebGL
rendering. This copying impacts performance, especially when handling
large datasets, unlike the direct access offered by Wasm linear
memory. 

 THE RAW TRUTH ABOUT SELF-PUBLISHING MY FIRST TECHNICAL BOOK: 800+
COPIES, $11K, AND 850 HOURS (14 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This author self-published a technical book on software architecture,
selling 800 copies and earning $11,000 in royalties after 850 hours of
work. He chose self-publishing for greater creative freedom and higher
royalty rates compared to traditional publishing. 

 ACCESSIBILITY ESSENTIALS EVERY FRONT-END DEVELOPER SHOULD KNOW (13
MINUTE READ) [21] 

 This post covers styling considerations like focus indicators and how
to use ARIA attributes. Following accessibility best practices
improves the user experience for everyone, not just those with
disabilities. Some key principles include using semantic HTML,
correctly structuring forms with labels (avoiding placeholders),
writing descriptive alt text for images, and having smooth keyboard
navigation with focus management in modals.

 WHAT IS FUNCTION SHARDING IN SERVERLESS COMPUTING? (4 MINUTE READ)
[23] 

 Function sharding in serverless computing is a divide-and-conquer
approach that improves concurrency, scalability, and fault isolation
by distributing a function's workload across multiple instances based
on input data criteria. 

 ADOPTING THE COMPILER AT WAKELET.COM IN PRODUCTION (2 MINUTE READ)
[24] 

 Wakelet.com successfully implemented React Compiler in production,
achieving a 10% improvement in LCP and a 15% improvement in INP, with
even greater gains in pure React components.
