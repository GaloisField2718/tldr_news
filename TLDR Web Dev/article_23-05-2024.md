ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SPEEDING UP FILE LOAD TIMES, ONE PAGE AT A TIME (14 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma improved the load times of large and complex files by
dynamically loading content as needed instead of all at once. It used
its existing dependency framework, QueryGraph, to track and load read
and write dependencies across pages. The Figma team implemented a
shadow mode for validating dependencies and making sure data stayed
consistent across unloaded pages. 

 REACT 19 LETS YOU WRITE IMPOSSIBLE COMPONENTS (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 React 19 has features like Server Components and Server Actions,
which optimize performance and simplify data handling by shifting more
logic to the server. Server Actions make API endpoint creation and
form handling easier by automatically managing pending UI states,
error handling, and optimistic UI updates. 

 THE CURIOUS CASE OF THE MISSING PERIOD (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A client using custom document templates for customer communication
experienced a recurring issue where periods would disappear from
emails sent to specific customers. The bug was traced back to an SMTP
client implementation that incorrectly handled lines starting with a
period. A similar problem showed up later when a different team failed
to patch the bug, resulting in some customers receiving incorrect
billing information in their emails.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 S3 IS SHOWING ITS AGE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 S3, Amazon's object storage service, is missing features like
compare-and-swap (CAS), multi-region buckets, and object appends. S3
Express One Zone, S3's faster alternative, lacks many standard S3
features and has high storage costs. As S3 continues to not have these
modern features, developers will have to either build workarounds or
move on to an S3 alternative. 

 THINGS YOU SHOULD NEVER DO AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEER (7 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Software engineers shouldn't be overly perfectionist or blindly
follow best practices. They should prioritize continuous refactoring
and think hard about choosing the right programming paradigms for the
context.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LOST THE JOY OF PROGRAMMING? TRY BUILDING PROJECTS FOR THE HECK OF IT
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 Ever wanted to build Git, BitTorrent, or SQLite from scratch? If that
sounds like a good time to you, you're in for a treat. CodeCrafters
lets you build complex projects in a hands-on, structured environment
[10]. This is the most fun you can have while also becoming a
massively better developer. Claim your TLDR discount here! [10] 

 NEOSYNC (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Neosync is an open-source way to anonymize PII, generate synthetic
data, and sync environments for a better developer experience.
Developers can safely test code against production data, reproduce
prod bugs locally, and fix broken staging environments. 

 LEGEND-STATE 3.0 ALPHA (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Legend-State is a state library for JavaScript and React/React Native
applications. 3.0 Alpha now has an offline-first, error-resilient sync
system. It comes with new persistence and sync plugins for Supabase
and TanStack Query. 

 JIRA.JS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Jira.js is a Node and browser module that allows developers to
interact with the Jira Cloud API, Jira Agile Cloud API, and Jira
ServiceDesk Cloud API.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW I MADE GOOGLE'S ‚ÄúWEB‚Äù VIEW MY DEFAULT SEARCH (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Google recently added a "Web" filter that provides a simplified
search results page similar to what Google looked like a decade ago,
without the added information and ads. This feature is currently
hidden under the "More" menu, but users can access it directly by
adding "udm=14" to the search URL or customizing their browser's
search settings. 

 SYSTEMATICALLY IMPROVING YOUR RAG (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 To improve your RAG system, create synthetic questions and answers to
evaluate precision and recall, then combine full-text and vector
search for the best retrieval. RAG systems should have user feedback
mechanisms to gather system performance data.

Compiler, with community members also sharing projects like React
Router v7. 

 YOU CAN NO LONGER LOG OUT OF X/TWITTER (REDDIT POST) [17] 

 X/Twitter automatically logs you in even when you log out because

Svelte and SolidJS. 

 ARE PEOPLE USING CONTAINER QUERIES? (3 MINUTE READ) [19]
