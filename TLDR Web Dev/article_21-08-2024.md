ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 NEVER CALL NEW DATE() INSIDE YOUR COMPONENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 It's good not to call impure functions like `new Date()` inside React
components, especially when setting the initial state. Doing so makes
testing difficult due to inconsistencies. Instead, it's better to pass
the impure function or its result as a prop, which this article shows
through code examples. 

 MAKING DATABASE SYSTEMS USABLE (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Traditional database systems have a tough time providing intuitive
and user-friendly interfaces. A 2007 paper identifies several "pains"
associated with relational databases, such as the complexity of joins,
overwhelming options, unexpected results, and difficulties with data
creation. There are potential solutions for improving database
usability, including the development of presentation data models,
integrated provenance, intuitive interactions, using LLMs, and
flexible schema design.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AN UNDERRATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERVIEW QUESTION (7 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A "bug squash" interview, where candidates are presented with a real
codebase containing a bug and asked to find and fix it, is an
underrated software engineering interview question. This author
believes this type of interview is more realistic and engaging than
traditional coding challenges, as it reflects the everyday work of
software engineers and allows candidates to showcase their debugging
skills and understanding of codebases. 

 TOASTS ARE BAD UX (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Toasts might be a bad user experience because they are disruptive and
often appear far from the user's focus. As an alternative, this author
suggests using a more integrated approach, such as a loading
indicator, to provide feedback for actions. He provides specific
examples from YouTube and Gmail to illustrate how toasts can be
replaced with more user-friendly methods. 

 ON FINISHING THINGS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This author struggles to finish personal projects because of the lack
of a clear definition of "finished," the absence of external
accountability, and the fear of sharing imperfect work. Writing a
detailed product spec upfront and setting time constraints for
projects helps him get past this block.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING ZED AI (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Zed AI is a hosted service that integrates AI-powered coding into the
Zed text editor, letting developers use LLMs while maintaining full
control over their code. 

 @SWAN-IO/BOXED (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 @swan-io/boxed provides TypeScript building blocks for functional
programming, including immutable types like Option, Result, and
Future. It makes development easier with a chaining API, reliable
types, and compatibility with pattern matching libraries. 

 PRERENDERING WITH PRESET VITE (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Preact's Vite preset now includes built-in prerendering. By
generating HTML at build time, this approach improves initial load
speeds and user experience with minimal changes to existing codebases.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FINDING A ‚ÄòHARMLESS' PI-HOLE VULNERABILITY (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This bug bounty hunter conducted a security audit of the open-source
ad blocker Pi-hole and discovered a "harmless" vulnerability in the
api.php file. The vulnerability allowed unauthenticated users to
change the CPU temperature format displayed on the Pi-hole status
page. While considered inconsequential by the Pi-hole team, the bug
bounty hunter reported the issue and contributed a fix to the code. 

 IS IT ME, OR THIS COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS OF A JUNIOR ARE TOO HIGH?
(REDDIT THREAD) [14]

developer are too high. Some say the bar has been raised for junior
developers, while others say that some companies just have higher bars
in general.
