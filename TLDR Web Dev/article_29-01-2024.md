ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WEB COMPONENTS IN EARNEST (49 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article is an extremely detailed walkthrough on how to build an
app (specifically a palette generator) using Web Components and
JavaScript. The app in this case is simple but complete. It‚Äôs
entirely built with custom elements, has almost no dependencies, and
runs fast. The author deep dives into the components and code, writes
his own testing library (300 lines), and discusses some positives of
using web components (like avoiding await/async or any other
artificially introduced async behavior). 

 HOW WE STRESS TEST AND BENCHMARK COCKROACHDB FOR GLOBAL SCALE (8
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CockroachDB is regularly stress-tested and benchmarked using various
benchmarking methods. These tests include daily benchmarks using TPC-C
and TPC-E benchmarks on different node configurations, weekly
benchmarks with larger clusters, and per-release benchmarks before
major software updates. Ad hoc tests, such as scalability testing with
varying node counts and workload types, are conducted to understand
performance at scale.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY TAILWIND ISN‚ÄôT FOR ME (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tailwind CSS is widely popular in web development today, but there
are some notable downsides to it. It leads to ugly-looking HTML. The
use of @apply in Tailwind is incompatible with other CSS frameworks,
leading to vendor lock-in. Tailwind also encourages the use of `div`
and `span` tags, whereas the modern web supports a much larger range
of expressive custom elements and attributes. 

 RATINGS != PROMOTIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 High ratings alone don‚Äôt necessarily lead to promotions. It‚Äôs
important to focus on adopting the behaviors of the next career level
as these behaviors are transferable, sustainable, and ultimately more
financially rewarding. 

 THINK FOR YOURSELF IF YOU WANT AI TO TEACH YOU HOW TO CODE (8 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 While AI can help generate code and provide solutions, developers
should be careful to not become too reliant on the technology.
Instead, they should approach AI tools with the goal of understanding
and reviewing the generated code rather than blindly copying it. This
not only allows for a better learning experience while coding, but
also allows for easier debugging later on.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING ANDROID EMULATORS, IOS SIMULATORS, AND OTHER PRODUCT
UPDATES FROM PROJECT IDX (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google‚Äôs Project IDX, a cloud-based workspace for full-stack
multi-platform development, has added support for various languages
and frameworks, including Astro, Go, Python + Flask, Preact, and
Node.js. Developers can now preview their Flutter mobile apps in an
iOS simulator or Android emulator. Project IDX now has simplified
Docker container management and supports running command-line tools
within the workspace and auto-detecting network ports. 

 TXTAI (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Txtai is an all-in-one embeddings database for semantic search,
language model orchestration, and various language model workflows. It
incorporates vector search with SQL, object storage, topic modeling,
graph analysis, and multimodal indexing. The project can be
implemented using Python or YAML and offers API bindings for various
programming languages.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT'S BEHIND THE TECH INDUSTRY'S MASS LAYOFFS IN 2024? (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 In the first four weeks of 2024, nearly 100 tech companies, including
Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, TikTok, and Salesforce, have
collectively laid off about 25,000 employees, despite their stock
prices returning to pre-pandemic levels and being highly profitable.
These layoffs seem to be aimed at satisfying investors and boosting
stock prices. They are driven by copycat behavior and may not actually
be necessary. 

 NEW GITHUB COPILOT RESEARCH FINDS 'DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON CODE QUALITY'
(8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GitHub Copilot usage has led to an increase in AI-assisted code,
which in turn has created a downward pressure on code quality. Code
written with AI is often harder to maintain and of lower quality as
it‚Äôs often verbose or copy-pasted. However, GitHub Copilot has had a
positive effect on developer productivity and satisfaction.

QUICK LINKS

 SIMPLE TRICKS TO LEVEL UP YOUR TECHNICAL DESIGN DOCS IN 2024 (8
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Technical design docs (or tech specs) are important because they
reduce risk, document decisions, and help align stakeholders on
technical choices. 

 ASK HN: WHAT HAPPENED TO STARTUPS, WHY IS EVERYTHING SO POLISHED?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [15] 

 Startups today are much more polished compared to the ‚ÄúMVP‚Äù
startups of the past. However, commenters agree that while startups
are more visually polished on the outside, it may not mean that they
are necessarily as polished on the inside (on the application level). 

 GIT COMMIT MESSAGES ARE USELESS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Git commit messages are often useless and unread. A better approach
for teams would be to adopt modern trunk-based engineering practices,
where pull request branches are squash-merged into the main branch,
making individual commit messages irrelevant. 

 WHERE DOES THE TIME GO? RUST'S PROBLEM WITH SLOW COMPILES (6 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Rust's slow build times have been a common complaint among
developers, but new tooling is able to optimize compilation.
