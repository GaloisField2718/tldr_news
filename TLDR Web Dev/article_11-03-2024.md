ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PLAYING WITH INFINITY IN CSS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This blog explores the concept of using `infinity` within CSS,
specifically in the `calc()` function, to achieve unique effects like
ensuring an element has the highest `z-index`, creating extremely
large elements, and dealing with browser inconsistencies. `infinity`
is essentially shorthand for the largest possible value in a
particular situation. This value can and will change between browsers,
operating systems, and CSS properties. It can be used to create some
pill shapes, hide content for screen readers, and make CSS animations.


 COROUTINES AND WEB COMPONENTS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Coroutines are functions that can be suspended and resumed while
potentially passing data between suspension points. They are useful
for implementing various patterns involving cooperation between
different tasks or functions, such as asynchronous flows. This article
demonstrates how to use coroutines to build a very flexible and simple
abstraction for UI components, enabling you to split behavior and view
into reusable bits, maintain internal state, and consolidate component
lifecycles within a single location. 

 SERVING ASTRO WITH RUST (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Astro is a static site generator that offers a robust development
experience with TypeScript integration and built-in i18n/l10n support.
Its static site generation conflicted with this developer's need for
server-side locale negotiation, so they integrated a Rust web server
(axum) to serve the Astro website, allowing for custom locale
negotiation logic while still using Astro's advantages.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 PERF IS NOT ENOUGH (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Databases often focus excessively on benchmark performance,
overlooking the fact that a subjectively better user experience is
often more important. The rate at which a database improves, ease of
use, and how it integrates into existing workflows are all factors
that can be more important when choosing a database over just raw
performance. Focusing on a streamlined user experience that empowers
quick analysis can sometimes offer a better edge than single-metric
performance gains. 

 WRITING DOCUMENTATION FOR YOUR TEAM (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To write effective documentation, carefully choose what to document,
focusing on common questions, poorly understood concepts, and
information crucial for informed decisions. Understand your audience's
knowledge level, tailor your language, and structure the documentation
for easy navigation. Write with the future in mind by explaining the
"why" behind decisions, linking to current information, and
encouraging a culture of shared documentation ownership. 

 STARTING A SIDE PROJECT AS A CREATIVE STUDIO (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To make the most of a side project, start with a problem you face
yourself and clearly outline goals. After that, iterate continuously
and take in feedback from users honestly. The success of a side
project doesn‚Äôt have to be defined solely by the money earned, but
rather based on what is learned.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TANSTACK STORE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 TanStack Store is a framework-agnostic type-safe store with reactive
framework adapters. It supports React, Vue, Angular, and SolidJS.
TanStack Store requires minimal setup and comes with granular APIs. 

 REACT UNFORGET (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 React Unforget is a compiler that analyzes React components and hooks
to identify optimization opportunities and automatically inserts
memoization code where it will have the most impact, reducing
unnecessary re-renders and improving overall performance. It features
intelligent memoization of components, hooks, and JSX elements, as
well as the ability to optimize code execution even in the presence of
early returns. 

 ONBOARDING_LIB (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 An onboarding library for building accessible, customizable, and
persistent onboarding flows in React apps.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SECURE BY DESIGN: GOOGLE‚ÄôS PERSPECTIVE ON MEMORY SAFETY (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Google has published a whitepaper that outlines its "Secure by
Design" approach, which advocates for the adoption of languages like
Java, Go, and Rust to achieve high-assurance memory safety. Google has
a massive C++ codebase. It will gradually adopt memory-safe languages
for new code while seeking safety improvements for existing C++. 

 S3 IS FILES, BUT NOT A FILESYSTEM (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Amazon S3 is often thought of as a cloud-based file system, but it
lacks important features of a traditional file system like partial
overwrites. This mismatch in expectations has significant implications
for software (especially databases) designed to work with filesystems
as it makes them incompatible with S3. Despite this, S3 still is
valuable due to its interface, high bandwidth, and low maintenance. 

 HOW HEAD WORKS IN GIT (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Git‚Äôs HEAD refers to your current location in the Git repository,
indicated either by a branch name or a commit ID stored in the
.git/HEAD file. HEAD can also be used as a command parameter ('git
show HEAD') to reference the currently checked-out commit. Git often
includes HEAD in its output (such as 'HEAD detached') to provide
context about your working state within the repository.
