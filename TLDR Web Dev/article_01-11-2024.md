ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SETS, TYPES, AND TYPE CHECKING (61 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Types are a way to provide information about the structure of
expressions and data within programs. Types like `any`, `never`,
`and`, and `or` are fundamental in JavaScript and TypeScript. Types
can be verified through subtyping and disjoint-ness tests. 

 HOW GOOGLE TAKES THE PAIN OUT OF CODE REVIEWS, WITH 97% DEV
SATISFACTION (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's code review tool, Critique, is highly rated among software
engineers internally. This article looks at what makes Critique so
loved and explains how it pairs with Google's code review process. It
covers Google's guidelines for efficient code review, internal
statistics on Google code reviews, and how Google uses AI to speed up
code reviews for engineers. 

 CACHE ME IF YOU CAN (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While caching is commonly used to improve performance, it presents
challenges like stale data and cache stampedes. Command Query
Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an alternative that provides
similar benefits with less complexity. CQRS separates read and write
operations, allowing for optimized solutions for each side. 

🧠 

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 EVERYONE IS WRONG ABOUT THAT SLACK FLOWCHART (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Slack's engineering team published an unnecessarily complex flowchart
in 2017. This author presents a simplified version of the flowchart
that more effectively conveys the core logic. The way we represent
complex systems impacts their comprehensibility. Presenting them
simply usually means that they can be understood simply. 

 I MOVED FROM SVELTE TO REACT (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This developer switched from Svelte to React after facing challenges
with Svelte's ecosystem and development productivity. He encountered
difficulties with network requests, accessibility requirements, and a
lack of mature and well-supported libraries. React offered a more
robust ecosystem with established libraries like Tanstack's offerings.

 INTRODUCING CHATGPT SEARCH (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI has integrated a web search function into ChatGPT, allowing
users to get quick answers and links to relevant sources directly
within the chat interface. The feature is currently available to
ChatGPT Plus and Team users, as well as SearchGPT waitlist users. 

 PYLON (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Pylon is a framework for building GraphQL APIs without defining
schemas. It uses TypeScript definitions to automatically generate
schemas. Pylon makes API development easier by reducing manual schema
maintenance and offering built-in functionalities like authentication,
authorization, and context management. 

 LOCALXPOSE (WEBSITE) [13] 

 LocalXpose is a reverse proxy that allows you to expose your
localhost to the internet, making it accessible from anywhere. The
platform offers both command-line and graphical user interfaces for
easy use and provides advanced access control features for managing
permissions and securing your tunnel. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 SUITS, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND LINEAR PROGRAMMING (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Linear programming can be used to identify money laundering schemes
by finding sets of accounts that sum to a specific amount. However,
the approach is impractical for real-world investigations. This is
because random data often contains numerous sets of accounts that add
up to the same amount, leading to an overwhelming number of false
positives. 

 GEMINI IN ANDROID STUDIO ROLLS OUT MORE AI-POWERED DEVELOPMENT
FEATURES (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google has released new AI-powered features for Android Studio. These
features allow developers to chat with Gemini, receive insights about
Android software, generate code suggestions, and modify code directly
using prompts. 

 A BRIEF SUMMARY OF LANGUAGE MODEL FINETUNING (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Fine-tuning can be used on LLMs for knowledge injection, teaching the
model new information, and alignment. Alignment-focused objectives can
be achieved via fine-tuning on small, high-quality datasets. A lot of
data isn't needed to learn the style or format of output, only to
learn new knowledge.

 CLAUDE FOR DESKTOP BETA (WEBSITE) [17]

 THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GLOBAL METHOD (IN RUBY) (9 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Methods without an explicit receiver, including user-defined ones,

defined at the top level. 

 AN UPDATE ON APPLE M1/M2 GPU DRIVERS (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The Apple M1/M2 GPU driver made progress in OpenGL conformance,
tessellation support using OpenCL, and its ability to run AAA games
through a combination of virtualization, emulation, and driver
adaptations. 

 Π0: OUR FIRST GENERALIST POLICY (12 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Physical Intelligence has developed a general-purpose robot
foundation model, π0, which can control a variety of robots and
