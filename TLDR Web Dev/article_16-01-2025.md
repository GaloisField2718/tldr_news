ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REFACTORING WITH CODEMODS TO AUTOMATE API CHANGES (22 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Codemods are automated scripts that use Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
to manage large-scale code changes, particularly when dealing with
breaking API changes or refactoring legacy code. They automate tasks
like removing feature toggles or refactoring complex components. This
article provides practical examples in JavaScript and shows how to
write codemods, test them effectively, and compose multiple smaller
codemods into larger transformations. 

 WHY DOES CLOUDFLARE PAGES HAVE SUCH A GENEROUS FREE TIER? (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Cloudflare Pages offers an unlimited bandwidth free tier, unlike
competitors with stricter limits. Practically, serving static websites
consumes minimal resources on Cloudflare's network, and the free tier
acts as effective marketing. 

 REBUILDING A 10 YEAR OLD IOS APP WITH EXPO (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A 10-year-old native iOS app was rebuilt using Expo. The goal was to
maintain all original functionality while minimizing custom native
code and adding Android and tvOS support. Expo SDK components and EAS
Build/Submit streamlined the process, with the majority of features
being implemented using existing React Native packages.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 NOBODY CARES (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This author talks about the widespread apathy they perceive in
society, as shown through examples of poor design, negligent behavior,
and lack of care in various aspects. This apathy extends across
professions, from software programmers to city bureaucrats, who
prioritize job security over quality of work. The place where the
author did not find apathy was a small startup where everyone is
dedicated and proactive. 

 LET THE USER HELP SOLVE THEIR OWN PROBLEM (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Current transit apps have a limited ability to allow users to
customize route selection beyond algorithmic suggestions. These apps
should allow users to specify preferred routes, similar to how email
spam filters use user input to improve their accuracy.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW TO BUILD A TESTING CULTURE… WITHOUT MICROMANAGING DEVELOPERS
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 Developers want rigorous testing and 100% coverage, but life gets in
the way - deadlines, production fires, backlogs. Find out how to build
a testing culture in this special one-off workshop with Sentry and
Growth Tribe [10]. You'll learn how to get buy-in, avoid
micromanagement, and help your team succeed. Join live on January 28th
[10] 

 EAS HOSTING (PREVIEW): HOST EXPO SERVER CODE IN THE CLOUD WITH EAS
(10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Expo's EAS Hosting is a new cloud service for deploying Expo server
code, including API routes and React websites. It addresses the
challenges developers face deploying server-driven apps, offering an
end-to-end solution integrated with EAS Workflows for deployment
across multiple platforms. It has features like monitoring, logging,
and error aggregation through a dashboard. 

 POSTAL MIME (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Postal Mime is a JavaScript library for parsing RFC822 formatted
emails in various environments (browser, Node.js, and serverless
functions). It can take a raw email and output a structured object
containing headers, recipients, attachments, and more.

 100X DEFECT TOLERANCE: HOW CEREBRAS SOLVED THE YIELD PROBLEM (7
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cerebras built a wafer-scale processor 50 times larger than the
largest existing computer chips, achieving comparable yields by
prioritizing defect tolerance. This was accomplished through
exceptionally small, fault-tolerant cores (100x smaller than those in
an Nvidia H100 GPU) and a sophisticated routing architecture that
bypasses faulty components. Unlike traditional approaches, Cerebras'
design minimizes redundancy while maximizing usable silicon. 

 H-1B VISAS POWER THE TECH INDUSTRY. BUT EXPERTS SAY THAT'S NOT
NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF A TALENT GAP (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Elon Musk controversially claimed that there was a shortage of top
engineers in the US, saying that increased immigration is needed to
fill the perceived gap. This sparked a debate, dividing supporters of
stricter immigration policies from tech entrepreneurs who rely on H-1B
visas for foreign workers. The data suggests there is a surplus of
American tech workers, and critics argue the H-1B program displaces
Americans and depresses wages. The situation is further complicated by
reports of tech companies laying off US workers while simultaneously
sponsoring H-1B visas. 

 CODE REVIEWS: A SUCCESS STORY (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A junior engineer implemented two features, A and B, using different
code review processes. Feature A, reviewed by colleagues with less
time and attention, shipped quickly but contained bugs requiring
multiple fixes. Feature B was rigorously reviewed by the engineer via
a detailed, well-justified process that emphasized smaller commits and
thorough testing. It took longer to develop but launched bug-free.
