ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WEBSOCKETS VS SERVER-SENT-EVENTS VS LONG-POLLING VS WEBRTC VS
WEBTRANSPORT (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There are many options for sending updates from the server to clients
for real-time web applications such as Long-Polling, WebSockets,
Server-Sent Events, and WebTransport. Long-Polling is outdated and
inefficient, while WebTransport is new and promising but lacks
widespread support. WebSockets are ideal for two-way communication in
scenarios like chats and games, while Server-Sent Events are great for
server-to-client updates. 

 IS AWS LAMBDA COLD START STILL AN ISSUE? (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A Lambda cold start refers to the initial delay experienced when an
AWS Lambda function is invoked after being idle. The duration of a
cold start varies from under 100 ms to over one second, the latter of
which occurs in about 1% of all invocations. This article goes into
detail on ways you can optimize cold start latency, such as
fine-tuning memory for your function, using ARM64 CPU architecture,
optimizing function creation methods, and more. 

 THE MECHANICS OF ASYNC AWAIT (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Under the hood, async/await is built on promises, where the async
function returns a promise that represents the eventual result. The
event loop handles promise resolution by tracking promises and
resuming suspended processes when promises are fulfilled. There‚Äôs a
notion that async/await is inherently non-blocking, but that‚Äôs not
true, as shown by a code example within this article.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Software development is more than just coding. AI tools like ChatGPT
help with specific tasks, but they can't replace the full range of
developer responsibilities, which include design, deployment,
gathering requirements, and more. Engineering is also about managing
complexity - AI may not be able to translate business problems into
software solutions properly. The market for technology is expanding,
so while AI may automate some tasks, the overall demand to solve
business problems will continue to grow. 

 WHAT I WISH I KNEW ABOUT ESPP AND RSUS SOONER (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 ESPPs (Employee Stock Purchase Plans) let you buy company stock at a
discount, which can be profitable if the stock price rises. RSUs
(Restricted Stock Units) are promised shares that vest over time. When
they vest, their value becomes taxable income. Use the ESPP discount
to buy shares, then immediately sell for a profit if you don't believe
in the stock's long-term growth. For RSUs, if you don‚Äôt want the
stock, sell them immediately upon vesting. This avoids price
fluctuations and the tax implications of holding the stock. 

 WHY AMAZON'S CULTURE MAKES ME A BETTER ENGINEER (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Amazon's leadership principles create shared expectations across
roles and ensure that everyone is working toward common goals. The
company prioritizes a single obsession to create a focused direction,
with the goal of becoming the best in the chosen area. This allows for
clear guidelines of success for both products created and for clearer
role guidelines on an individual level, removing ambiguity from
performance evaluations.

machine learning skills. After two intensive weeks [18], you‚Äôll have
a first-principles understanding of ML from concept to production and
be ready for the future of software development. This course is deeply
technical [18], requires a full time commitment, and is only open to
experienced developers. Fit the bill? Apply now [18] 

 TEAMCITY PIPELINES (WEBSITE) [19] 

 JetBrains has released TeamCity Pipelines, which offers self-tuning
CI/CD pipelines to help developers stay in flow.

 Shiki is a syntax highlighter that runs on any JavaScript runtime and
works with VS Code. 

 PLANKA (GITHUB REPO) [21] 

 Planka is a real-time Kanban board built with React and Redux. It can
be used to create projects, boards, lists, labels, cards, and more.
Planka supports Markdown, filtering, real-time updates, and internal
notifications.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OH SH*T, MY APP IS SUCCESSFUL AND I DIDN‚ÄôT THINK ABOUT
ACCESSIBILITY (17 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Apps built without considering accessibility can miss out on a
significant portion of users. Retrofitting accessibility can be
difficult. This article shows how to improve accessibility within a
SwiftUI iOS app. The process involved auditing the app, fixing text
scaling, implementing views when necessary, improving accessibility
for screen readers, and using native components when possible. In
general, it‚Äôs easier to develop while keeping accessibility in mind
than to rehaul applications to be more accessible after the fact. 

 BEFORE THE CROWD SHOWS UP (7 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Success often comes from being among the first to engage with new
opportunities or "arenas". Arenas can be communities, platforms,
movements, technologies, or even physical spaces like coffee shops or
cities. Early arrivals in a new arena enjoy advantages like easier
networking, access to important figures, insider knowledge, and
professional opportunities. However, new arenas are also inherently
risky. Developers should focus on identifying a niche within an
‚Äúarena‚Äù regardless of when they arrive and focus on contributing
as much value as possible. 

 LOOK MA, I WROTE A NEW JIT COMPILER FOR POSTGRESQL (9 MINUTE READ)
[24] 

 pg-copyjit is a new experimental PostgreSQL JIT compiler designed to
be faster than the existing LLVM JIT. The compiler has reduced
overhead as it prioritizes producing "fast enough" code quickly and
uses a "copy-and-patch" method that stitches together pre-compiled
code snippets for speed.

 ASK HN: HOW TO CHANGE JOBS WITH ALMOST NO INTERVIEWING EXPERIENCE?
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [25] 

 It‚Äôs helpful to practice mock interviews and interview with many
companies when switching jobs without any interviewing experience. 

 TEST GENERATOR | PLAYWRIGHT (7 MINUTE READ) [26] 

 Playwright comes with the ability to generate tests for you as you
perform actions in the browser. 

 A NEW SERVERLESS POSTGRES PLATFORM (10 MINUTE READ) [27] 

 Xata, a database platform, now offers a serverless Postgres service. 

 DESIGN IS AN ISLAND (5 MINUTE READ) [28] 

 Developers should be prepared for both incremental adjustments and
significant re-designs when designing software.
