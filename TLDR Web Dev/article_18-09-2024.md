 YES, YOU SHOULD USE SQLITE: NOTION'S CREATIVE SQLITE USAGE FOR 20%
FASTER LOADS (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Notion implemented WebAssembly (WASM) SQLite in its web app. This
resulted in a 20% reduction in page navigation latency. To achieve
this, its team used Web Workers to offload database operations to
background threads and a SharedWorker with the Web Locks API to fix
data integrity issues. They also addressed issues of slow disk reads
by implementing a "race" between disk cache and network requests. 

 HOW INFINITE QUERIES WORK (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Infinite queries in React Query, often used in paginated lists or
infinite scrolls, allow for continuous data fetching. A bug found in
this feature caused queries to restart from the beginning if a page
fetch fails during a retry. This article explains how infinite queries
work in order to explain how the bug happened, along with the fix,
which involves modifying the infinite query behavior to retain the
state of the loop, preventing it from restarting from the beginning
during retries.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 A DIFFERENT WAY TO THINK ABOUT TYPESCRIPT (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This post proposes a new way to understand TypeScript's type system.
It suggests thinking of types as sets of possible values they can
construct. This means a string type represents the infinite set of all
possible character permutations, and a number type represents the
infinite set of all possible digit permutations. TypeScript's features
like intersection, union, and type introspection can be understood as
operations on these sets. 

 CORRELATION DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Simply because two variables move together doesn't mean one directly
influences the other. For example, ice cream sales and sunburn rates
correlate, but the actual cause is a third variable: temperature. The
same applies when making decisions in engineering teams: charts can be
helpful, but they shouldn't be taken as the sole representation of
reality, as the real world is far more complex. 

 BEING AN ENGINEERING MANAGER AT AMAZON (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This engineering manager learned three things from his time at
Amazon: solve problems through mechanisms, communicate with precision,
and give teams full autonomy. He misses the deep technical talks at
Amazon but doesn't miss the inconsistent management culture before
Andy Jassy's leadership changes.

 THE FIRST RULE OF MACHINE LEARNING: START WITHOUT MACHINE LEARNING (8
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The first rule of machine learning is to start without it. It's best
to initially tackle problems using simpler methods like heuristics and
rules. This approach provides a baseline understanding of the data and
problem and can even outperform machine learning models in certain
cases. 

 WHAT CAN WE DO AT OUR COMPANY TO ATTRACT GREAT TALENT? (REDDIT
THREAD) [14] 

 Startups can differentiate themselves to attract top engineering
talent by offering remote work, better work environments, better pay,
and good work-life balance. They also can reach out to potential
candidates on LinkedIn and have an engineering blog. 

 THE PRAGMATIC ENGINEER: THREE YEARS (17 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Pragmatic Engineer newsletter, started by ex-Uber
engineer/manager Gergely Orosz, is now three years old. Looking ahead,
Orosz will continue his deep dives into interesting tech companies and
technologies. The Pragmatic Engineer podcast will also launch next
week, featuring interviews with experienced engineers and tech
professionals.

 WARNING: MACOS SEQUOIA 15 MAY BYPASS DNS ENCRYPTION (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 A bug in macOS Sequoia 15 causes some DNS requests to bypass DNS
encryption, potentially exposing users' browsing activity to
monitoring. 

 CLEANER JAVASCRIPT PROMISES WITH SAFE-AWAIT (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The "safe-await" package handles a more explicit and structured
approach to handling async operations compared to nested try/catch
blocks. 

 WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE USE LINUX? (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Despite its benefits, Linux's demanding nature prevents widespread
adoption, similar to how people choose easy options over healthier
choices. 

 YOU CAN'T OVERRIDE !IMPORTANT USER AGENT CSS DECLARATIONS (2 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 !important is often used to override specific CSS styles, but it may
not always work in practice because the style is coming from user
agent style sheets, which have higher priority than author agent style
sheets.
