 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN TO MINUTES WITH QA WOLF (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If QA is a bottleneck on your software engineering team and you're
releasing slowly because of it, you need to check out QA Wolf.

Their fully-managed service gets engineering teams to 80% automated
end-to-end test coverage [5] and their AI-native platform helps dev
teams SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs for web and mobile apps

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 ABUSING SQLITE TO HANDLE CONCURRENCY (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SkyPilot uses SQLite for state management, but had issues with high
concurrent writes when scaling its Managed Jobs feature, leading to
database lock errors. After investigating SQLite's internals, it found
that lock acquisition is prone to starvation due to the lack of FIFO
guarantees and that WAL mode doesn't fully solve concurrent write
problems. Avoiding SQLite for high write concurrency is the best
option, but WAL mode and a high lock timeout can be used if you must
use SQLite for such situations. 

 FINDING LEAKED PASSWORDS WITH AI: HOW WE BUILT COPILOT SECRET
SCANNING (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GitHub Copilot secret scanning uses AI to detect generic passwords in
codebases. The development team faced challenges with unconventional
file types and the need for resource-efficient scaling, leading to
improvements in offline evaluation, prompt engineering, and
workload-aware request management. Mirror testing was necessary for
high precision and a low false positives rate. 

 RESOURCE PREFETCHING MAY SLOW DOWN YOUR WEBSITE (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 While prefetching is supposed to improve website performance by
loading resources in advance, it can sometimes worsen loading speed by
competing with critical content for bandwidth. Despite being assigned
the lowest priority, prefetch requests may initiate too early,
delaying the loading of important elements like the Largest Contentful
Paint (LCP). To prevent this, you can inject prefetch hints via
JavaScript after the initial page load to make sure essential content
loads first.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 LLM SUBSCRIPTIONS VS. APIS VALUE FOR MONEY (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 LLM subscriptions like ChatGPT Plus and Claude Pro are cheaper than
using their API equivalents. The potential AI usage one could get from
these $20 subscriptions can potentially exceed $1300 per month for
Claude and $14,661 for ChatGPT if fully used. Even with lower usage,
the subscription still provides a cost-effective alternative to direct
API access. 

 GOODBYE, SKYPE: A PRODUCT INSIDER'S TAKE ON THE ICONIC APP'S FALL (7
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The downfall of Skype was due to a lack of focus, prioritization of
features over quality, and a failure to capitalize on opportunities
like the COVID-19 pandemic. Plus, Microsoft's focus on Teams made
Skype redundant and obsolete. 

 HOW TO DO THOUGHTFUL CODE REVIEWS (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Before sending out code for a review, devs should do a self-review
and break down large changes into smaller pull requests. The code
reviewer should provide specific, actionable feedback. Repetitive
tasks like formatting should be handled by linters and AI agents.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NUT (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Nut is an open-source project that combines debugging technology with
AI to automate bug fixing during app dev. It uses recording
capabilities to provide AI with the context needed to effectively
debug code generated through prompting, making creating apps without
having to manually write code easier. 

 STYLE OBSERVER (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Style Observer is an observer library that lets you observe CSS
changes and run JS.

 WHY FASTDOOM IS FAST (14 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The fastDOOM port of DOOM (a video game) runs much faster on a
restored IBM PS/1. fastDOOM's speed improvements are from various
optimizations, such as code cleanup, strategic inlining, and renderer
choices. 

 DEALING WITH (HYPOTHETICAL) SHAM PACKAGES (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This post discusses a hypothetical scenario where a malicious
package, a "Swindle" in the "Sham" language ecosystem, is introduced
into a software supply chain. In this case, an engineer might
unknowingly merge a malicious update through automated dependency
management, leading to potential security breaches. It then goes over
how to discover the compromise and deal with it properly.

 MICHIGAN TYPESCRIPT FOUNDER SUCCESSFULLY RUNS DOOM INSIDE
TYPESCRIPT'S TYPE SYSTEM (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The founder of Michigan TypeScript successfully ran Doom within
TypeScript's type system by creating a WebAssembly runtime in
TypeScript types, processing 177 terabytes of type definitions, and
essentially turning the type checker into a virtual machine. 

 HOW DEEPSEEK BECAME A FORTUNE TELLER FOR CHINA'S YOUTH (12 MINUTE

linked together with CSS view transitions instead of complex
JavaScript. 

 SHOULD MANAGERS STILL CODE? (9 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 While all engineering managers should be familiar with their team's
codebase, whether they should actively write code depends on the
individual manager, team, and organization.
