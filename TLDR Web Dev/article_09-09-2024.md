 ü§∫ JIRA CHANGE MANAGEMENT SHOWDOWN (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When you need a Jira change management tool, you'll find two strong
contenders on the market ‚Äî Project Configurator (PC) and
Configuration Manager for Jira (CMJ) [4].

Both apps help administrators move projects and configurations between
Jira sites for a variety of use cases, like migration and change
promotion. But they are not the same [4] when it comes to:

üîí In-app safeguards

‚ö°Ô∏è Data capacity and speed

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Overall user experience

If you're using Project Configurator, it might be time to switch to
Configuration Manager for Jira (CMJ). Read why (and how) to make the
change on the Appfire blog [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CREATING A GIT COMMIT: THE HARD WAY (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This blog post shows how to create a Git commit using low-level
commands. It explains fundamental Git concepts like blob, tree, and
commit objects, showing how they interact to form a commit. The post
walks through a step-by-step guide on creating a commit using commands
like `hash-object`, `update-index`, `write-tree`, and `commit-tree` to
teach Git's object-based architecture. 

 WEBP: THE WEBPAGE COMPRESSION FORMAT (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This post explores different compression methods to improve the
loading time of a website hosted on GitHub Pages. The author uses WebP
to compress their blog's HTML content. This is done as a workaround
because their blog hosting platform, GitHub Pages, doesn't support
Brotli compression. They describe the process of encoding the HTML as
a WebP image and then using JavaScript and the Canvas API to decode it
back to HTML on the client-side. 

 MULTITHREADING IN NODE.JS: USING ATOMICS FOR SAFE SHARED MEMORY
OPERATIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Multithreading in Node comes with the risk of race conditions, where
multiple threads accessing the same memory location can lead to
inconsistent results. Atomics is a JavaScript API designed to address
this issue by providing atomic operations that guarantee the integrity
of shared memory access. It can be used to prevent race conditions and
make sure that operations on shared resources occur as a single,
uninterruptible unit.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOUR COMPANY NEEDS JUNIOR DEVS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There's a current trend of solely hiring experienced "elite"
developers, which ignores the value of junior employees in driving
knowledge creation and psychological safety within teams. By teaching
juniors, senior employees deepen their own knowledge and learn to
challenge their assumptions. It also overall helps create a culture of
learning, where mistakes are seen as opportunities for growth and
juniors are encouraged to ask "dumb" questions, which can often lead
to groundbreaking ideas. 

 THE ‚ÄúEMAIL IS AUTHENTICATION‚Äù PATTERN (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The common practice of using "Forgot Password" links as a primary
authentication method is inefficient and risky. It relies on
disposable passwords and ignores better security practices like
password managers and multi-factor authentication. This behavior is
not a conscious decision, but rather a learned process that people
have adopted over time. 

 ASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 With fundamental technological change, we tend to make predictions
about the wrong things rather than getting our predictions wrong. This
has been illustrated in the past, such as in 1950s science fiction,
which was unable to envision women working, or the RAND study from
1964 which predicted automatic doctors and robots but missed the rise
of general-purpose computing and the internet. This pattern continues
today, with the focus on predicting the next big thing like VR or
autonomous vehicles while overlooking the potential implications of
underlying technological shifts.

 DEFEATING THE FINAL BOSS OF ENDPOINTS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Imagine an endpoint that involves a long series of HTTP calls, file
I/O, third-party calls (AI generation), and finally a couple of DB
queries. Where do you even start debugging performance issues?! Learn
how developer and podcaster Dan Mindru shaved off 22.3 seconds per
call with Sentry Trace View. Read the blog [11] or join the workshop

a subset of JSON Patch. 

 INERTIA.JS (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Inertia is a tool that allows developers to build single-page
applications without needing to create an API by utilizing existing
server-side patterns and connecting them to client-side frameworks
like React, Vue, and Svelte.

 LINUX'S BEDTIME ROUTINE (28 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article presents an overview of how Linux hibernates, focusing
on the initial steps leading up to the system freeze. It starts by
examining the system files /sys/power/state and /sys/power/disk, which
serve as entry points for debugging and controlling hibernation. It
then explores the autosleep mechanism, a feature borrowed from
Android, which automatically suspends or hibernates the system when
it's inactive. Finally, it goes over the steps involved in preparing
the system for hibernation, including locking the system, preparing
the console, notifying power management components, and synchronizing
filesystems to disk. 

 ATPROTO FOR DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS ENGINEERS (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The AT Protocol is a technology by Bluesky designed for open social
networking. It utilizes a decentralized backend architecture that
leverages a shared data model called the "user data repository". This
allows applications to share data and interact easily. 

 A POST-GOOGLE WORLD (19 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google's dominance in the advertising and tech industries is a major
threat to innovation and democracy. Its business model, built on
controlling both the buyers and sellers of ads, has led to ongoing
