ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PARSING 1 BILLION ROWS IN BUN/TYPESCRIPT UNDER 10 SECONDS (8 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 A dev tackled the 1 Billion Row Challenge in Bun/TypeScript,
processing a 13.8GB file containing temperature data for weather
stations in under 10 seconds. They bypassed initial memory limitations
by using file descriptors with 128KB buffer chunks (optimized for
kernel readahead pages) instead of loading the entire file into
memory, and they used worker threads to parallelize both I/O and
CPU-intensive operations across multiple cores. They also aggregated
min/max/average values using hash maps while using Bun's performance
advantages over traditional Node.js. 

 STOP USING CUSTOMEVENT (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Devs should avoid using CustomEvent in JavaScript and instead
subclass the native Event class. CustomEvent was only created because
subclassing native classes wasn't well-supported when it was
introduced, and it forces developers to deal with the awkward `detail`
property to access event data. Event subclasses provide cleaner APIs,
better TypeScript support, serve as documentation, and guarantee
consistent event creation. 

 CSS CONDITIONALS WITH THE NEW IF() FUNCTION (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The new CSS `if()` function can be used to write inline conditional
styles instead of separate media queries or style blocks. The function
supports three types of queries (style, media, and supports) and uses
a condition-value pair syntax like `property: if(condition-1: value-1;
condition-2: value-2; else: fallback-value)`. This allows for cleaner,
more maintainable code by keeping conditional logic inline with the
property rather than scattered across multiple CSS blocks.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW I BUILD SOFTWARE QUICKLY (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There's no single right way to build software quickly. This dev
starts with a rough draft to uncover unknowns and avoid premature
abstractions, then refines it based on the project's needs and
acceptable level of imperfection. He softens requirements where
possible, focusing on the task at hand to avoid distractions, and
makes small, manageable changes. 

 HOW I USE CLAUDE CODE (+ MY BEST TIPS) (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A former Cursor power user switched entirely to Claude Code and
recommends it over other AI coding tools. Some tips include running
`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` to avoid constant permission
prompts and using `/clear` frequently to manage tokens effectively.
Claude Code is great at handling large codebases and complex tasks, as
it successfully updated an 18,000-line React component that other AI
agents couldn't handle.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CALLFS (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 CallFS is a REST API filesystem that provides Linux filesystem
semantics over multiple backends (local, S3, and peer networks). It
has features like single-use links, distributed locking, and
Prometheus monitoring. 

 ZSHY (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 zshy is a bundler-free build tool for TypeScript libraries designed
to simplify the process of transpiling TypeScript code. It supports
dual-module (ESM and CJS) builds, uses tsc for transpilation, and
removes the need for bundlers or configuration files by reading
directly from package.json and tsconfig.json.

 HYPERCAPITALISM AND THE AI TALENT WARS (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The hypercapitalistic AI talent wars are fueled by massive capital
investment and the race to develop frontier AI models. This
environment erodes Silicon Valley's trust-based culture, necessitating
new employment contracts and investment norms to protect both
companies and talent. The talent war is consolidating power among a
few well-funded companies, making it challenging for new entrants and
requiring investors to be more flexible. 

 THE UNIVERSAL WAY: ONE CODEBASE, ALL PLATFORMS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Universal applications have a single codebase that can be deployed
across multiple platforms like web and mobile. Recent advancements in
technologies like Solito and Expo now make truly cross-platform
development a viable option. Universal apps can increase brand
presence across devices while reducing operational costs by 30-40%,
allowing smaller teams to manage multiple platforms more efficiently. 

 'I THINK YOU SEE THE FUTURE FIRST ON ANDROID' – GOOGLE'S ANDROID
LEADER SAMEER SAMAT (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google's Android Ecosystem President Sameer Samat discussed the
latest developments in Android, including Android 16 and its deep
integration with Gemini AI. Google is committed to making Android
customizable and accessible across various devices, like the Samsung
Galaxy Z Fold 7, which is launching with the newest Android version.
Regarding Android XR, Google is still pursuing augmented reality
glasses, learning from past mistakes like Google Glass and using AI to
create a more useful and fashionable wearable experience.

QUICK LINKS

 PROTECTING MY ATTENTION AT THE DOPAMINE CARNIVAL (2 MINUTE READ) [14]


 The cognitive impacts of technology, such as decreased attention and
memory, can be mitigated by limiting phone usage, intentional
scheduling, and having guardrails for AI use. 

 AIOSQLITEPOOL (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 aiosqlitepool is a high-performance asyncio SQLite connection pool
that improves database performance by reusing connections, caching
data, and maximizing throughput. 

 APPLE MLX IS ADDING CUDA SUPPORT (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 There is an ongoing effort to add a CUDA backend to the MLX
framework, sponsored by Apple. 

 PRINTING THE WEB: MAKING WEBPAGES LOOK GOOD ON PAPER (8 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 CSS media queries with `@media print` can be used to style website
content for printing.
