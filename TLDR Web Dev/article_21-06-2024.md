 COLLABORATING ON APIS IS EASIER WITH POSTMAN (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When every dev team relies an APIs, collaboration is crucial. To ship
better software, API producers and consumers need to share, discover,
and reuse high-quality API assets.

Postman revolutionizes the experience of collaborative API development
with Postman Collections [5] and Workspaces [6].¬†

Used together, they enable API design, testing, and documentation
while providing a shared canvas for collaborating on API assets.¬†

Learn how companies like Cvent [7], Visma [8], Built Technologies [9],
and Amadeus [10] are using Postman to collaborate more easily and
deliver higher-quality APIs.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SO WE'VE GOT A MEMORY LEAK‚Ä¶ (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This developer tackled a memory leak in his high-traffic Rails app by
analyzing heap dumps and using tools like rbtrace, heapy, and sheap.
The root cause was traced to a combination of an issue in
ActiveSupport::Subscriber and invalid URIs processed by the Bugsnag
gem. He goes over his debugging process throughout the article. 

 CUSTOM ELEMENTS DON'T REQUIRE A HYPHEN AS A SEPARATOR (3 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 This author was initially confused about the rules for valid custom
element tag names, as his Codepen tests with emojis failed due to a
JavaScript error. After fixing the error, they realized that custom
element tag names only need a hyphen, not necessarily as a separator.
This means that tags like mytag- or h1- are valid, although using them
might not be recommended. 

 OPTIMIZING AI INFERENCE AT CHARACTER.AI (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Character.AI optimizes LLM inference by using memory-efficient
architecture design with techniques like Multi-Query Attention, hybrid
attention horizons, and cross-layer KV sharing. It also utilizes
stateful caching to store attention KV on host memory between chat
turns to get a 95% cache rate. Other optimizations, like integer
quantization, added allowed the company to reduce serving costs by 33x
compared to its initial state in late 2022.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY WE NO LONGER USE LANGCHAIN FOR BUILDING OUR AI AGENTS (8 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Octomind decided to stop using LangChain for building AI agents
despite initially finding it helpful. LangChain's high-level
abstractions made its code more complex and difficult to maintain,
especially as its requirements became more sophisticated. The company
advocates for a "building blocks" approach using simple, low-level
code with carefully selected external packages. 

 THOUGHTS ON CODE REVIEWS (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Code reviews are necessary for maintaining code quality and sharing
knowledge within a team, but they can be inefficient if not optimized.
Principles, design docs, and static analysis should be used to reduce
the scope of reviews. Implementing an Automate/Defer/Pair framework
allows teams to handle code changes quickly based on complexity and
risk.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ROOSTER (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Rooster is a framework-independent JavaScript rich-text editor that
operates within a single HTML div element. It uses a "Content Model"
layer to manage editing operations and convert them into HTML. Rooster
includes packages for core functionalities, API access, DOM
manipulation, and plugins. 

 REASSURE (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Reassure automates performance regression testing for React Native
apps by measuring render times and function executions. It integrates
with Jest and React Native Testing Library or React Testing Library to
provide detailed reports on performance changes. 

 ANNOUNCING TYPESCRIPT 5.5 (37 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 TypeScript 5.5 comes with inferred type predicates, RegEx syntax
checking, a JSDoc @import tag, and more. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 ZIG VS RUST AT WORK: THE CHOICE WE MADE (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A company chose Zig over Rust for a critical library rewrite. It
found that the Zig compiler and build system's ability to integrate
easily with existing codebases and support multiple target platforms
was a strong factor. 

 THE PROGRAMMER'S BRAIN (45 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This article explores how developers can improve their coding skills
by understanding and optimizing their cognitive processes. It covers
reading and understanding code more efficiently, memorizing syntax,
problem-solving strategies, avoiding cognitive overload, and best
practices for naming variables and refactoring code. It also talks
about the importance of understanding the cognitive dimensions of
programming languages and codebases. 

 TESTING THE IMPACT OF BUY NOW, PAY LATER ACROSS 150,000+ CHECKOUT
SESSIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Stripe's experiment on BNPL options showed that businesses can
increase revenue by up to 14% and attract new customers without
significant cannibalization of card transactions. As a result, BNPL is
a valuable addition to checkout processes for boosting sales.
