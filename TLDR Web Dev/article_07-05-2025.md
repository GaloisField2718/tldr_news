ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO WRITE ERROR MESSAGES THAT ACTUALLY HELP USERS RATHER THAN
FRUSTRATE THEM (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Effective error messages not only help users recover quickly, but
also builds trust with them. However, the message content themselves
are often overlooked in UX design. Instead of vague, robotic, or
cutesy language, write conversationally in an active voice, clearly
identify what went wrong, and provide specific next steps. 

 OPTIMIZING MOBILE APP BATTERY USAGE & CRASH RATE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A React Native app can be optimized for mobile battery by addressing
battery drain and crash issues. A team improved the app's crash-free
rate to nearly 99% by fixing Android's headless mode transition
problems, which were causing restart loops during route tracking. They
also reduced battery consumption by implementing smarter database
queries that only activated when new location data was available.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GETTING THINGS "DONE" IN LARGE TECH COMPANIES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In large tech companies, "getting things done" isn't just about
completing tasks, but delivering value that is visible and appreciated
by decision-makers. Engineers can fall into the trap of endless
incremental improvements, which may be productive but lack impact in
the eyes of management. To truly succeed, engineers should focus on
finishing projects to a satisfactory point, declaring victory, and
moving on to new, impactful initiatives. 

 GIT STASH DRIVEN REFACTORING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A common problem during development is when attempting to implement a
new feature leads to a cycle of unrelated refactorings. This results
in a messy and often non-compiling workspace. To get around this, use
`git stash` to manage these refactorings by stashing current changes,
addressing the refactoring, and then popping the stash to continue,
working "inside-out." 

 THE CURSE OF KNOWING HOW, OR; FIXING EVERYTHING (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Once a programmer recognizes flaws in software, they feel compelled
to correct them. This compulsion leads to a constant cycle of building
and rebuilding. However, this can lead to burnout over time, so it's
important for devs to figure out the highest-impact problems to spend
their time on.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING CLERK BILLING (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Clerk Billing is the easiest way to implement subscriptions for B2C
and B2B applications. No payment integration code to write, no UI
work, nothing to keep in sync. Just enable Billing and drop a on your
/pricing page. Try it today! [10] 

 GEMINI 2.5 PRO PREVIEW: EVEN BETTER CODING PERFORMANCE (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Google has released Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (I/O Edition), which has
improved coding capabilities, especially in front-end web development
and agentic workflows. 

 EXA (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Exa is a search API with a new sourcing tool called Websets, allowing
businesses and developers to access and utilize web data for various
applications like research, recruiting, and sales. It has features
like comprehensive search, content crawling, and LLM integration. 

 CRITICAL CSS (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Critical CSS is the minimal CSS needed for above-the-fold content.
This tool helps generate critical CSS, which helps to improve website
performance.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MATT GODBOLT SOLD ME ON RUST (BY SHOWING ME C++) (9 MINUTE READ) [14]


 A talk by Matt Godbolt on API design in C++ explored how Rust
addresses similar problems, such as preventing misuse of data types.
While C++ requires more effort to avoid mixing up quantities and
prices and struggles to handle runtime conversions from user input,
Rust offers built-in protections that catch these errors at compile
time and force explicit handling of potential conversion failures.
Rust's advantages also go past just memory safety, with an ability to
prevent common mistakes through thoughtful language design. 

 FROM MANUAL FIXES TO AUTOMATIC UPGRADES — BUILDING THE CODEMOD
PLATFORM AT LYFT (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Lyft Engineering built a Codemod Platform to automate code
transformations and dependency upgrades across their many frontend
microservices. This platform uses jscodeshift to parse and modify
code. The platform features a CLI tool, reusable helper functions, and
standardized codemod implementation, allowing devs to easily write and
run transforms.

 PREPARING FOR WHEN THE MACHINE STOPS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The increasing reliance on AI in software development, while
initially leading to speed, may lead to a dangerous dependence on
tools we don't fully understand. 

 NND (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 NND is a fast, TUI-based Linux debugger for x86-64 native code. 

 CLAUDE'S SYSTEM PROMPT (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 Claude's system prompt is over 24k tokens with tools. 

 AI PROBLEMS NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Tech executives' plans to replace developers with AI may be
short-sighted, as AI's ability to code relies on developer-created
content, and companies that invest in augmenting developers with AI
(rather than replacing) will likely surpass those focused solely on
cost reduction.
