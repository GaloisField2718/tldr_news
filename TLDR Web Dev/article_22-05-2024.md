ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW SLACK BUILT A DISTRIBUTED CRON EXECUTION SYSTEM FOR SCALE (8
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Slack initially relied on cron jobs for its notification system but
found it hard to scale. To address this, its team developed a new cron
execution service using Go and Kubernetes for scalability and a
leader-follower architecture for simplified synchronization and rapid
failover. This service offloads resource-intensive tasks to a job
queue, using Kafka for durability and Redis for efficient dispatch to
worker nodes, and tracks job execution with a Vitess table for
deduplication and monitoring. 

 AVOID THE LONG PARAMETER LIST (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Long parameter lists in functions can be hard to understand and
maintain. Instead, it's better to create value objects that group
related parameters into a single object. This makes the function calls
simpler and makes the code more maintainable.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 CLEVER CODE IS PROBABLY THE WORST CODE YOU COULD WRITE (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Although clever code feels impressive to write, it's often
unmaintainable and unreasonable to write in production. Code that is
easy to understand and readable is arguably harder to write than
clever code. This article provides tips and resources for getting
better at writing clear code, along with an anecdote about the
difficulties of writing clear code and an email about coding style
from John Carmack. 

 I WANT FLEXIBLE QUERIES, NOT RAG (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This author is against the hype around RAG, which is used to help
LLMs generate references alongside its answers. Instead, they believe
that the flexible queries of LLMs are more valuable and prefer direct
access to the relevant information. 

 WHY YOU SHOULD SAY NO MORE OFTEN (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Saying no can help you prioritize your most important work and avoid
overcommitting. Say yes to things that energize you and ask yourself
if you would still be excited about the opportunity if it were
happening tomorrow. If you're still unsure, defer the decision by
asking the person to follow up later.

MISCELLANEOUS

 UI DENSITY (20 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 UI density is more than just visual clutter, it's about the amount of
information an interface conveys over time. Dense interfaces should
take into account temporal density (how quickly a user can complete
tasks) and value density (whether the design leads to valuable
outcomes). 

 TAKING RISK (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 UK graduates from top universities tend to favor stable jobs over
riskier startup ventures. This is probably due to a cultural
difference, with the US embracing a more positive-sum mindset towards
risk and business growth. 

 BUILDING AN AI GAME STUDIO: WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SO FAR (11 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Braindump is an AI game studio that lets users build top-down/2.5D
games by typing prompts. It allows users to define units, abilities,
and attributes, as well as populate the game map with objects and
create game rules. Two challenges in building AI games were designing
an intuitive user interface for prompting the AI and creating a
streamlined "game API" that provides enough structure for the LLM to
focus on filling in code and data.
