 JIRA AUTOMATION ‚Äî ADVANCED STRATEGIES TO BYPASS RULE LIMITS AND
BOOST PRODUCTIVITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Developers want to automate as much busywork as possible, but Jira
doesn't always make it easy.

Watch this recorded session [4], featuring top Atlassian Community
Leaders and Jira experts, to learn how you can go from limits to
liberation with advanced automation techniques [4].

Covered in the session:

 	* Limits of Jira's built-in automation features, and how to bypass
them.
 	* Strategic approaches for using no-code, low-code, and scripting
solutions [4].
 	* How emerging technologies like AI [4] are reshaping automation
possibilities.

 HOW META TRAINS LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AT SCALE (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta is facing challenges in training large language models due to
the amount of computational power required. This has led to the
company rethinking its infrastructure in terms of hardware
reliability, failure recovery, efficient training state preservation,
and optimal GPU connectivity. Meta is innovating across the
infrastructure stack by developing new training software and
scheduling algorithms, modifying hardware like the Grand Teton
platform, optimizing data center deployments, and exploring new
fabrics for network infra. 

 HOW TO HACK YOUR GOOGLE LIGHTHOUSE SCORES IN 2024 (19 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Perfect Lighthouse scores do not guarantee flawless website
performance as the tool can be manipulated to yield artificially high
results. For example, you can show the smallest amount of
LCP-qualifying content on load to boost the FCP and LCP scores until
the Lighthouse test has likely finished. Figuring out what the user
experience is actually like needs a holistic overview of real-world
performance, user field data, and more. 

 WEAK MEMOIZATION IN JAVASCRIPT (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Memoization in JavaScript involves storing the results of expensive
function calls to improve efficiency. You can use global variables or
granular factory functions for basic frontend caching. Advanced
techniques include using `WeakMap` and cascading structures inspired
by React's `cache` function, which allows for storing multiple results
and has automatic garbage collection. WeakMaps can also be used to
establish relations between objects, as seen in React's experimental
API.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DON'T REFACTOR LIKE UNCLE BOB. PLEASE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 One of the refactoring examples in the book "Clean Code" is overly
complex and less understandable than the original piece of code. There
are issues like unnecessary class creation, unclear naming, and
excessive function separation. Developers should prioritize code
readability over just strictly adhering to arbitrary rules. 

 FROM CHAOS TO CLARITY: MY JOURNEY WITH OBSIDIAN (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Obsidian, an open-source note taking app, can be used for
productivity with its scratchpad, task lists, daily notes, and weekly
reviews. Canvas can be used for creating graphs to visualize goals and
dependencies. Practice spaced repetition for knowledge retention. 

 HOW TO USE ENGINEERING METRICS üìä (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Engineering metrics should be used narrowly at first, with just one
metric being the focus for a team's productivity. Over time, more
metrics can be tracked and added, as long as they are aligned with the
team's broader goals.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 üëâ REMOVE QA BOTTLENECKS WITH AUTOMATED E2E TEST COVERAGE (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 Engineering Leaders! Looking to improve your dev team's efficiency
with faster release cycles?

With QA Wolf [11], you can run your entire E2E test suite in less than
15 minutes and achieve 80% automated test coverage in weeks [11], not
years.

Plus, they provide unlimited parallel test runs [11] on their
infrastructure and 24-hour maintenance at no additional cost.

This case study shows how AutoTrader saved $620k/yr [12] on QA
engineering and customer support + increased their release velocity by
up to 20%.

 LAMBDA API (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Lambda API is a streamlined web framework designed for AWS Lambda
using AWS API Gateway Lambda Proxy Integration or ALB Lambda Target
Support. It draws inspiration from frameworks like Express.js and
Fastify, but has been optimized for performance within Lambda's
stateless, single-execution model. 

 RESTATE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Restate allows you to build workflows, event-driven applications, and
distributed services in a fault-tolerant manner with durable
async/await. It can be used to build Lambda workflows as code,
transactional RPC handlers, event processing with Kafka, and more. 

 GRAPHQL-QUERY-COMPLEXITY (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Graphql-query-complexity is a tool that analyzes GraphQL query
complexity to safeguard servers against resource exhaustion and DoS
attacks. It allows setting maximum complexity thresholds and provides
customizable estimators for calculating field complexities based on
schema and query structure.

 HOW ALEXA DROPPED THE BALL ON BEING THE TOP CONVERSATIONAL SYSTEM ON
THE PLANET (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Alexa had the potential to be the leader in conversational AI due to
its resources and talent, but it faced technical and organizational
challenges. The internal infrastructure was difficult for developers
to work with, and the fragmented organizational structure stopped
effective collaboration. Additionally, there was a misalignment
between product goals and scientific research timelines. 

 PGVECTOR IS NOW FASTER THAN PINECONE AT 75% LESS COST (13 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 pgvectorscale is a new open-source PostgreSQL extension that improves
the performance and scalability of vector operations. It achieves this
through StreamingDiskANN, a disk-based vector search index that is
more cost-efficient than in-memory indexes, and Statistical Binary
Quantization, a novel compression method that improves accuracy.
Benchmarks show that PostgreSQL with pgvector and pgvectorscale
outperforms other commercial vector databases. 

 HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF POSTGRES MEMORY SETTINGS (18 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Postgres uses shared buffers, the largest segment of RAM, to cache
frequently accessed data pages. shared_buffers should typically be set
to 25% of available RAM to optimize memory usage, but can be adjusted
based on buffer cache utilization. Work memory, controlled by
work_mem, is allocated per query node and should be set carefully to
avoid excessive memory usage or disk spillage. This article goes into
detail tips to reduce memory consumption.
