ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REPLACE YOUR JAVASCRIPT ANIMATION LIBRARY WITH VIEW TRANSITIONS (15
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The new View Transitions API in Chrome and Safari makes web
animations easier. For example, a navigation animation can be created
using only HTML, CSS, and a few lines of JavaScript. The process
involves using `startViewTransition` to smoothly transition between
DOM states, along with CSS to style the transitions and
`view-transition-name` to target specific elements for animation. 

 HOW WE HACKED A SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR $50K (19 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Two bug bounty hunters collaborated to find a critical vulnerability
in a company's recently acquired subsidiary. They discovered a GitHub
Actions token embedded within a Docker image, allowing them to
potentially compromise the entire development-to-production lifecycle.
By analyzing the Docker image layers using tools like `dive` and
`dlayer`, they recovered a private npm token, letting them inject
malicious code into a private package used across the company's
systems.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AI IS STIFLING TECH ADOPTION (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI models are stifling the adoption of new technologies due to
outdated training data and inherent biases. The "AI knowledge gap”
is caused by the time lag between a technology's release and its
inclusion in AI training data, which is discouraging developers from
using newer tools. Also, AI models often have a preference for certain
technologies (like React and Tailwind), which influences developers'
choices. 

 ASK HN: FORMER EMPLOYEES' RSUS AT RISK AFTER STARTUP'S IPO (HACKER
NEWS THREAD) [7] 

 Former employees of a recently IPO'd startup are seeking advice on
their RSU settlement process, which is different from typical
practices. The company requires them to prepay taxes in cash before
receiving shares, which means they might lose their shares if the
payment isn't made by a strict deadline. This is different from the
sell-to-cover option offered to current employees, which is unfair.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW TO INSPECT REACT SERVER COMPONENT ACTIVITY WITH NEXT.JS (SPONSOR)
[8] 

 If you're used to debugging and profiling code with in-browser dev
tools, React Server Components (RSCs) are going to ruin your day.
Learn how to use OpenTelemetry with Next.js to trace the execution of
RSCs [8] on the server side — and add observability and
visualization with Dash0 [9]. 

 LAUNCHING INTEROP 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Interop 2025 project improves web platform interoperability
across different browsers. Interop 2024 achieved a 95%
interoperability score, and 2025 will address 19 focus areas,
including improvements to existing features and new ones like Storage
Access and CSS Zoom. 

 DATA FORMULATOR (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Data Formulator is a Microsoft Research app using AI to make data
visualization easier. It lets users create visualizations iteratively
with natural language, transforming data and generating charts based
on user instructions and prompts. 

 EMITTERY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Emittery is a simple asynchronous event emitter for Node.js and
browsers. It has a clean API with methods for subscribing to events
(`on`, `once`), emitting events (`emit`, `emitSerial`), and managing
subscriptions. Emittery uses symbols for event names to avoid
collisions and has many debugging options.

 HOW I BUILT AN AI COMPANY TO SAVE MY OPEN SOURCE PROJECT (19 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 A developer's open-source planning project, OptaPlanner, almost died
after Red Hat's acquisition by IBM. As a result, he created Timefold
AI, a company built around a commercial offering (open core business
model) extending OptaPlanner, with the help of his open-source
reputation. 

 EMERGING PATTERNS IN BUILDING GENAI PRODUCTS (30 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 When building production-ready generative AI products, evals are used
to assess model performance and embeddings are used to represent large
datasets efficiently. RAG is used to add context and ground LLM
responses. LLMs are still not hallucination-free nor are they always
efficient in retrieving context using RAG. Some solutions for
inefficient retrieval are discussed, like hybrid retrievers, query
rewriting, and rerankers.

 THE EUROPEAN ACCESSIBILITY ACT FOR WEBSITES AND APPS (9 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 The European Accessibility Act (EAA), effective June 28, mandates
accessibility standards for websites and apps of EU-operating
companies, requiring compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines by June
28, 2027. 

 HOW DOES REACT NATIVE'S NEW ARCHITECTURE AFFECT PERFORMANCE? (4
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 React Native's new architecture, enabled by default in version 0.76,
can improve app performance through optimizations in rendering
(Fabric), native module communication (Turbo Native Modules),
JavaScript interaction (JSI), and code generation (Codegen). 

 SEARCH RESULTS WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google's client-side search no longer functions without JavaScript,
but DuckDuckGo and Yahoo still support a method of no JavaScript by
using different search parameters.
