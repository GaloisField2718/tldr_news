ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PUSHING THE WHOLE COMPANY INTO THE PAST ON PURPOSE (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 In 2015, the author prevented a repeat of a previous system failure
caused by a leap second by implementing "leap smearing." This involved
subtly slowing down the company's internal time for 20 hours before
the leap second, making it effectively one second behind the rest of
the world. The author tested this method extensively using
custom-built clocks and various systems. 

 THE CANVA OUTAGE: ANOTHER TALE OF SATURATION AND RESILIENCE (18
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Canva experienced a major outage triggered by a seemingly innocuous
deployment of a new editor page. A stale Cloudflare traffic rule
misrouted user traffic over the public internet, causing latency and a
backlog of 270,000+ requests for JavaScript files. This led to a
"thundering herd" effect, overwhelming Canva's API gateway with 1.5
million requests per second. Canva engineers mitigated the outage by
manually increasing capacity and using Cloudflare's firewall to
temporarily block traffic. 

 BAD APPLE BUT IT'S 6,500 REGEXES THAT I SEARCH FOR IN VIM (14 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The author re-created a Bad Apple music video within Vim using only
search queries. The process involved converting the video frames into
binary data, representing each pixel as a character in a
Vim-compatible grid using a square font. They then developed
algorithms to decompose each frame into a minimal set of rectangles,
which are expressed as complex Vim search patterns. Finally, a Vim
macro iterates through these patterns.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THOUGHTS ON STATE MANAGEMENT LIBRARIES IN THE REACT COMPILER ERA (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Daishi Kato, the creator of the popular React state management
libraries Zustand, Jotai, and Valtio, discusses the future of them in
light of the React Compiler and Server Components (RSCs). The React
Compiler's optimization capabilities may diminish the core need for
these libraries by removing unnecessary re-renders, a problem they
currently solve. RSCs also lessen the reliance on these libraries for
server-side state caching. However, these libraries still offer
valuable features like state organization and composability. 

 WHY AREN'T WE ALL SERVERLESS YET? (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Widespread serverless adoption hasn't occurred due to lingering
challenges from the previous microservices transition and concerns
about making complexity worse, and organizational readiness lags too.
The shift to serverless requires investment in new infrastructure and
tooling to support the fragmented architecture. 

 STOP TRYING TO SCHEDULE A CALL WITH ME (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Trying out new software services is often frustrating due to the
relentless sales tactics of companies. This often involves a series of
unwanted calls and demos showcasing irrelevant features. This has led
the author to switch to open-source alternatives often, freeing them
from the cycle of unwanted sales interactions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE BEST PRODUCT ENGINEERING ORG IN THE WORLD (69 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 As VP of Engineering, James Shore addressed his CEO's request to
measure software engineering productivity by defining the "best
product engineering organization" through six key areas: People,
Internal Quality, Lovability, Visibility, Agility, and Profitability.
He detailed strategies for improvement in each area, including
fostering an “Extreme Programming” culture, improving code quality
through iterative refinement rather than large-scale rewrites, and
using a "product bets" system for strategic prioritization. For
reference, “Extreme Programming” practices include evolutionary
design, merciless refactoring, and test-driven development. 

 HERE'S HOW HUCKSTERS ARE MANIPULATING GOOGLE TO PROMOTE SHADY CHROME
EXTENSIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Researchers have discovered that some developers are exploiting a
loophole in Google's Chrome Web Store to promote shady extensions
through keyword manipulation. They achieve this by hiding thousands of
irrelevant keywords in lesser-used language translations within
extension descriptions, manipulating search results to prioritize
their extensions over legitimate ones. 

 AI-DRIVEN PROTOTYPING: V0, BOLT, AND LOVABLE COMPARED (9 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 v0, Bolt, and Lovable each offer distinct strengths for building web
applications. v0 is great at rapid UI prototyping, especially within
the React ecosystem, while Bolt prioritizes full-stack development
speed in a browser-based environment. Lovable focuses on guided
full-stack development and collaborative features.

 UV HAS A KILLER FEATURE YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 UV, a drop-in replacement for the Python package manager `pip`,
stands out in its ability to easily manage Python dependencies and
virtual environments with a single command, removing much of the need
for ad-hoc scripting. 

 ‘THE INTERNET HASN'T MADE US BAD, WE WERE ALREADY LIKE THAT': THE
MISTAKE OF YEARNING FOR THE ‘FRIENDLY' ONLINE WORLD OF 20 YEARS AGO
(13 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 While nostalgia for a seemingly friendlier pre-2000s internet is
prevalent, experts argue that many of the current online issues
already existed then, but are just filtered out through the
rose-colored lens of nostalgia. 

 OBVIOUS THINGS C SHOULD DO (4 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 The C language should be updated to allow compile-time function
evaluation, compile-time unit testing, forward referencing of
declarations, and direct importing of declarations. 

 LLM AGENT ASSISTED CODING (13 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 A software engineer shows how they improved their coding efficiency
using Claude Sonnet 3.5 and Model Context Protocol servers, which
allowed an LLM to automate various tasks like managing GitHub Issues
and deployments.
