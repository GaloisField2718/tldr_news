 DATADOG‚ÄôS STATE OF CLOUD SECURITY RESEARCH FINDS WIDESPREAD USE OF
LONG-LIVED CREDENTIALS, OTHER RISKS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 How do organizations approach and mitigate issues that lead to
documented public cloud security incidents?

Datadog analyzed security posture data [4] from a sample of thousands
of organizations [4] that use AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Their
findings suggest that organizations still face significant challenges
around issues such as:

	*
Managing static, long-lived credentials

	*
Securely configuring user roles, access, and privileges within cloud
resources

	*
Enforcing best-practice safeguards such as multi-factor authentication
(MFA)

 STREAMING HTML OUT OF ORDER WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Streaming HTML sends HTML from server to browser in chunks as it is
generated. It took a back seat as single-page applications became the
standard, but it has become more popular along with server-side
rendering. A clear advantage to streaming HTML is you can render
something immediately to indicate to the user that something is
happening and you can start downloading assets like CSS and JavaScript
earlier while you wait for the more time-consuming parts of the
response to be generated. 

 HOW WE ENGINEER FEEDBACK AT FIGMA WITH ENG CRITS (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Engineering crits at Figma are collaborative sessions designed to
foster brainstorming, knowledge sharing, and problem-solving early in
the development process. Inspired by design critiques, Figma uses
FigJam to facilitate asynchronous feedback, ensuring everyone‚Äôs
perspectives are included in the conversation. Unlike traditional
reviews, engineering crits emphasize suggestions over mandates. 

 PRISMA ORM ADOPTION GUIDE: OVERVIEW, EXAMPLES, AND ALTERNATIVES (18
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Prisma is an open source ORM that allows you to easily manage and
interact with databases. This guide discusses the features, benefits,
and use cases of Prisma to help you decide if it‚Äôs the right choice
for your next project.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE QUIET, PERVASIVE DEVALUATION OF FRONTEND (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There is a widespread disregard for front-end development within the
tech industry. Frontend work is sometimes biased against as there are
beliefs that frontend is less technical and thus, less valued. This
devaluing of frontend work harms the quality of software products and
limits the potential of the web. 

 BREAKING DOWN TASKS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To better estimate software projects, it‚Äôs helpful to break them
down into smaller, well-defined tasks. This process starts with a
high-level goal and iteratively expands tasks until they are clear
enough for a developer to understand what needs to be done and how to
know when it's complete. 

 YOU'RE NOT A WEAK DEVELOPER IF YOU DON'T ALWAYS SHOW OFF YOUR
TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Developers sometimes prioritize code perfection over delivering value
to customers, leading to negative effects for both teams and
customers. Teams should shift their focus to smaller, more frequent
deliveries that provide immediate value to the customer, even if
temporarily sacrificing some code quality. By breaking down large
projects into smaller increments and limiting work-in-progress,
developers can significantly shorten development cycles and have
happier customers.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU TO REACH 80% AUTOMATED TEST COVERAGE?
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 If you‚Äôre trying to scale QA in-house, the answer is years. If
you‚Äôre using QA Wolf [11], the answer is no more than 4 months.

‚Üí QA Wolf automates and maintains hundreds (sometimes thousands) of
end-to-end tests [11], running on the QA¬†Wolf cloud on every
deployment. What can you test? Integrations, APIs, extensions, email,
SMS deliverability, audio, video ‚Äî whatever you‚Äôve got, really.

 ANNOUNCING SPEEDOMETER 3.0: A SHARED BROWSER BENCHMARK FOR WEB
APPLICATION RESPONSIVENESS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Speedometer 3.0 is a collaborative benchmark measuring web
application responsiveness. This launch comes with new tests, improved
measurement techniques, and a cross-browser governance model designed
to drive further web performance improvements. 

 JSON CANVAS (WEBSITE) [13] 

 JSON Canvas is an open-source file format designed for storing and
exchanging data from infinite canvas tools (like digital whiteboards).
It aims to improve the longevity, readability, and flexibility of
user-created content within these applications. 

 GOQITE (WEBSITE) [14] 

 Goqite is a persistent message queue library built on SQLite and
inspired by AWS SQS.

 USING LLMS TO GENERATE FUZZ GENERATORS (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 LLMs show potential for generating fuzzers to find bugs in code. A
fuzzer is a program that automatically inputs semi-random data into a
program or stack to detect bugs. While LLMs can find some software
bugs through static analysis, results are often less reliable than
traditional techniques due to false positives. As LLMs get better,
they could be used to create targeted fuzzers to uncover
vulnerabilities. 

 TRUST BUT TEST: VENDOR SECURITY TESTING AT CANVA (7 MINUTE READ) [16]


 Canva's Security Testing team ("Priority Zero") actively tests
vendors to strengthen their security posture and protect customer
data. The team chooses engagement targets thoughtfully, focusing on
smaller vendors or niche areas where they can provide the most value
rather than large providers who already undergo extensive testing.
Their testing process is collaborative: vendors provide minimal
upfront input. Canva testers work in dedicated environments to
minimize disruption.
