 HOW TO IMPROVE SEARCH WITHOUT LOOKING AT QUERIES OR RESULTS (12
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Canva developed a system that used generative AI to create a
synthetic dataset of realistic queries and designs. This let the
company perform offline evaluation of search algorithm changes. The
system was meant for privacy, which meant that user queries were
hidden from training. The approach allowed for rapid, reproducible
testing of code changes locally, speeding up Canva's development
process. 

 ASTRA DYNAMIC CHUNKS: HOW WE SAVED BY REDESIGNING A KEY PART OF ASTRA
(7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Slack's log search engine, Astra, initially used fixed-size data
chunks, leading to wasted disk space and increased infrastructure
costs due to underutilized chunks. To address this, the Slack team
redesigned Astra to use dynamic chunks. This involved implementing a
first-fit bin packing algorithm to optimize chunk assignment across
cache nodes, using Zookeeper for persistent data tracking.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 LEGACY SHMEGACY (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The problem with legacy code isn't the code itself, but rather poor
knowledge transfer and maintainability among developers. Long
programmer tenure, well-architected and documented code, effective
knowledge-sharing practices, and the use of standardized tech and
frameworks can prevent code from becoming legacy code. 

 CODIN' DIRTY (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A "codin' dirty" approach is better than following a "clean code"
philosophy. This means writing larger, contextually relevant
functions, with integration tests over unit tests for their stability
and higher-level perspective. It also means minimizing the number of
classes and interfaces to simplify project complexity. 

 GETTING OVER NOT BEING A GOOD ENOUGH PROGRAMMER (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Complex code, persistent frustration with debugging, and the rise of
AI tools can make developers fear that they are not good enough.
Progress, even if imperfect, constitutes "good enough.”

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SQLITESTUDIO (WEBSITE) [9] 

 SQLiteStudio is a free, open-source, cross-platform application for
creating, editing, and browsing SQLite databases. 

 RILL (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Rill is a lightweight Go toolkit that makes concurrent programming
easier by providing composable, channel-based functions for common
concurrency tasks, like batching, error handling, and order
preservation. 

 ONE MILLION SCREENSHOTS (WEBSITE) [11] 

 A rendering of over a million of the web's top homepages.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HEY, WAIT – IS EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE REALLY GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTED??
(21 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Employee performance at Fortune 500 companies is probably best
represented by a Pareto distribution (rather than the common Gaussian
distribution). This Pareto distribution implies that the bottom 10% of
performers are not drastically different from the next 10%, negating
the justification for annual firings based on a forced curve. 

 MACOS TIPS FOR PROGRAMMERS: THREADING (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple's system aggressively prioritizes tasks based on Quality of
Service (QoS) classes (User Interactive, User Initiated, Legacy,
Utility, and Background). This influences CPU scheduling and I/O. To
avoid priority inversion bugs, use specific synchronization primitives
like `os_unfair_lock` or `pthread_mutex`, which enable QoS
inheritance, boosting lower-priority threads when accessed by
higher-priority ones. 

 HOW TREATING LLMS AS “ACTORS” CAN PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A new research paper proposes treating LLMs as "Method Actors" to
improve prompt engineering. This approach frames prompts as scripts,
guiding the LLM through a performance, similar to how a director
guides an actor. The "Method Actors" model breaks down complex tasks
into smaller, manageable subtasks, leading to better performance on
certain tasks.

QUICK LINKS

 NOTICE OF BREAKING CHANGES FOR GITHUB ACTIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 GitHub Actions has announced several upcoming breaking changes,
including a migration of the `ubuntu-latest` label, the shutdown of
Artifact actions v3, updated workflow validation for pull requests
from forked repositories, a new webhook rate limit, and network allow
list updates for self-hosted runners. 

 REACT NATIVE TRUE SHEET (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 A native, performant bottom sheet component for React Native apps,
with features like blur support and asynchronous ref methods. 

 HOW TAILSCALE'S INFRA TEAM STAYS SMALL (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Tailscale's small infrastructure team (only three engineers) manages
a large-scale network efficiently by using its own product. 

 AMAZON S3 ADDS NEW FUNCTIONALITY FOR CONDITIONAL WRITES (2 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Amazon S3 now supports conditional writes, allowing users to prevent
accidental overwrites of objects by verifying the object's ETag before
updating it.
