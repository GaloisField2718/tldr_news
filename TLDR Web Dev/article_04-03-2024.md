 REPORTING CORE WEB VITALS WITH THE PERFORMANCE API (13 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The Performance API is a set of standards for measuring and
evaluating performance metrics with JavaScript. This article
demonstrates how to use the Performance API to generate performance

 HOW LINKEDIN SERVES 5 MILLION USER PROFILES PER SECOND (10 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 LinkedIn's user profile views created a massive read workload that
pushed the limits of its existing document database, Espresso. To
solve this, its team introduced Couchbase, a distributed NoSQL
database, as a caching layer to reduce the read load on Espresso. They
designed the caching layer to be independent of Espresso to avoid
cascading failures if Couchbase experienced issues. The entire profile
dataset is cached in every data center for quick access.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ASK HN: HOW CAN I LEARN ABOUT PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION? (HACKER NEWS
THREAD) [8] 

 Various commenters write about how to learn about performance
optimization better. It‚Äôs important to start with fundamentals, such
as the sources of performance issues and how CPU cycles are wasted.
Further techniques can be studied depending on the tech stack and use
case. Concepts like parallelization, data structure optimization, and
latency versus throughput are mentioned. 

 QUALITY IS A HARD SELL IN BIG TECH (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Big tech companies often release products with issues like
unintuitive UIs, outdated code, unfixed bugs, and poor developer
experience. This focus on quantity over quality stems from a
prioritization of short-term stock gains driven by flashy new
features, rather than investments in long-term product improvement.
This strategy involves intentionally degrading product quality after
establishing user dependence.

focus on team goals over just personal goals. Collaboration trumps
code perfection. Software engineers should build relationships for

MISCELLANEOUS

 INSIDE THE CRISIS AT GOOGLE (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google's recent AI debacle with its Gemini image and text generation
tool has sparked an internal crisis, with plummeting morale and calls
for CEO Sundar Pichai's resignation. While the public focuses on
potential bias in the tool, the root cause lies in organizational
chaos: unclear ownership of Gemini's development and a lack of
accountability within Google teams. This dysfunction led to hasty
decision-making and insufficient coordination, resulting in the tool's
problematic outputs.
