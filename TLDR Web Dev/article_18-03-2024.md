 HOW WEB BLOAT IMPACTS USERS WITH SLOW DEVICES (21 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The web has seen an increase in complexity, slowing it down
significantly for users with low-end devices or slow internet
connections. Modern web apps are CPU-hungry. Even with fast internet,
websites like Threads and Patreon take a long time to load on low-end
phones because of CPU demands. Most developers believe that hardware
will get faster and solve performance issues, but hardware
improvements slow down over time. Instead, deliberate optimization to
reduce CPU impact is crucial in making the web usable for everyone as
web bloat locks people from countries with slower internet speeds out.


 LAMBDA ON HARD MODE: INSIDE MODAL'S WEB INFRASTRUCTURE (20 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Modal's HTTP and WebSocket stack for serverless functions allows for
seamless web endpoint deployment and real-time communication
capabilities. To overcome the limits of traditional serverless
platforms, Modal designed a system that can handle demanding
workloads, offering extensive CPU, memory, and GPU resources. Modal
treats HTTP/WebSocket requests like function calls and leverages Rust
and ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) for efficient
processing. 

 PASSKEYS ‚Äì UNDER THE HOOD (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Passkeys are an alternative to traditional passwords designed to be
phishing-resistant and user-friendly. Unlike hardware security keys,
passkeys can be backed up and synced across devices. However, since
the private key is stored on the device with passkeys, this can
potentially make passkeys less secure than hardware keys, unless
private keys are exportable.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HERE'S WHAT DEVELOPERS FOUND AFTER TESTING DEVIN AI (8 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Devin AI is a recently released software engineering tool. This post
looked at how Devin created 4 projects: setting up a Chatbot, creating
a US airport map, developing a chess website, and crafting a Chrome
extension. It highlights Devin's coding and debugging capabilities and
potential to replace software developers. 

 A FEW WORDS ON TESTING (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Years of encountering slow, unreliable tests and fixing bugs without
adding tests have shaken this author‚Äôs faith in testing as the
ultimate quality indicator. There are many high-quality projects that
run surprisingly few tests. The key to software quality isn't the
amount of testing, but rather prioritizing tests based on developer
judgment and having developers that deeply care about their work. 

 THE HIGH-RISK REFACTORING (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Before starting a refactor, developers should carefully assess the
potential costs of failure (lost revenue, damaged trust, etc.) and how
those risks can be mitigated. Refactors should be isolated from
feature development and be rigorously tested. Sometimes, the best
choice can be to not do a refactor.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CLOUD COST MANAGEMENT BY THE TEAM BEHIND EC2INSTANCES.INFO (SPONSOR)
[10] 

 You‚Äôve probably used EC2Instances.info [11] to price out and
compare your AWS workloads. The data for EC2Instances comes from
Vantage [10], a cloud cost optimization platform for AWS, Azure,
Kubernetes, and a dozen other cloud services. Sign up to [12] get a
FREE savings estimate [12] 

 SATCSS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A CSS refactoring tool that minimizes CSS files. 

 PRETZEL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Pretzel is an offline tool for exploring and visualizing large
datasets directly within a web browser. Its interface and automatic
updates streamline data manipulation, eliminating the need for complex
setups. 

 UI KIT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 A UI kit for building performant 3D user interfaces for Three.js in
React with support for nested scrolling, buttons, inputs, dropdowns,
tabs, checkboxes, and more.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THE HELLDIVERS 2 AND PALWORLD LAUNCHES (16
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 When games have unforeseen popular launches, like Palworld and
Helldivers 2 did, it can be hard for them to stay online under such
heavy load. Several factors contribute to launch failures: inadequate
server capacity, unforeseen bugs appearing at scale, poor community
management, and underestimating player demand. To manage these issues,
some companies use flexible scaling solutions with cheap servers (like
Google Cloud) or carefully design games to reduce complexity (like
Thatgamecompany), while others focus on increasing the number of
players in a single instance (like Unchained Entertainment). 

 THE RETURN OF THE FRAME POINTERS (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Frame pointers are used for reliable debugging and profiling and
allow tools to accurately trace program execution. A 2004 compiler
change removed frame pointers by default to slightly boost
performance, breaking many profilers and debuggers. Decades later,
Fedora and Ubuntu are now releasing versions with frame pointers
enabled by default, vastly improving the accuracy of profiling tools. 

 USE LEGACY LINES OF CODE TO ESTIMATE A SOFTWARE REWRITE (8 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Estimating software rewrites is difficult due to the hidden
complexities within legacy code. A useful way to estimate a rewrite is
to count the lines of code in an existing system, which represents the
project‚Äôs complexity. Based on this, you can create an estimate as
such: Developer Days = Total LOC / LOC per Day per Developer.

 ON AUTOMATING SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Software engineering automation is progressing similarly to
self-driving cars, with AI gradually taking on more tasks while humans
provide oversight, leading to a future where developers supervise AI
and provide high-level input.
