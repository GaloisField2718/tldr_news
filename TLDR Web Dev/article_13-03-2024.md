ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE DAY SOFT DELETES CAUSED CHAOS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Soft deletes in databases, while seemingly convenient, can lead to
unfortunate consequences due to their hidden complexity and potential
for data integrity issues. This author recounts a severe incident
where a change in soft delete handling during a migration resulted in
allowing the selling of the same seat an unlimited number of times for
a popular concert. It‚Äôs worth considering using history/audit tables
for preserving deleted data instead of soft deletes in production
systems. 

 WHAT IS INP AND WHY YOU SHOULD CARE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google introduced Interaction to Next Paint (INP) as a new Core Web
Vital on March 12 to emphasize the importance of a website's overall
responsiveness throughout a user's entire visit. INP measures the
delay between users' interactions (clicks, taps, or keypresses) and
visual feedback from websites. To understand and improve your
website's INP score, utilize the Performance tab in Chrome DevTools,
prioritize timely visual feedback, and optimize JavaScript execution. 

 MY FAVORITE ANIMATION TRICK: EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING (9 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Exponential smoothing is an animation technique that provides a
smooth and responsive way to move objects towards their target
positions. This blog demonstrates its use in UI elements and camera
movement, showing its advantages over linear or easing-based
animations. The mathematical basis of exponential smoothing is derived
from differential equations, so it automatically handles varying time
intervals and speed parameters.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 40 YEARS OF PROGRAMMING (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This essay reflects over a four-decade career in software
development. To be a successful software engineer, one must
communicate and collaborate well. While "getting things done" is
important, developers must also consider the long-term maintenance
costs of their work. Readers should find their own best practices for
productive software engineering while also remembering to take care of
themselves. 

 NERVOUS ABOUT Q&AS? 7 ESSENTIAL TIPS TO ANSWER CONFIDENTLY (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 While feeling nervous when asked questions under pressure is normal,
it can hinder your ability to respond with the best possible answer.

strategically clarify the question before answering. If the question

For complaints, focus on understanding the underlying concerns rather
than getting defensive.
