ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE IN REACT: THE ART OF COMPONENT FOCUS
(4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class or component
should have only one reason to change. By separating the layers of
data fetching, business logic, and presentation into distinct
components, code becomes more maintainable, testable, and flexible.
When creating components, some tips to apply this principle are to
extract reusable logic into custom hooks and use composition to build
features from simple parts. 

 SCALA 3 MIGRATION: REPORT FROM THE FIELD (16 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A developer migrated a large Scala 2.13 project to Scala 3, which was
tough at first due to dropped features and lots of code changes.
However, the migration was made easier by using IntelliJ's migration
tools, using sbt source generators with Scalameta to replace lost
macro annotation functionality, and finding workarounds for removed
type projections. 

 PRE-BUILT IOS BINARIES: REDUCING REACT NATIVE DEV START TIME FROM
MINUTES TO SECONDS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Monarch Money uses pre-built iOS binaries to cut down on React Native
build times from over 20 minutes to seconds. The process involves
using a CI server to build and upload binaries, using a custom script
to download and install them on the simulator, and then running the
Metro bundler.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DESPAIR DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Despair-Driven Development (DDD) is an engineering approach that uses
feelings of despair and burnout to be productive. This means reaching
the "flow state" to escape the negativity. Scientific research
supports the idea that flow state can alleviate depression and
burnout. 

 AI MAKES TECH DEBT MORE EXPENSIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI tools struggle to generate useful responses in codebases with lots
of tech debt, such as those with subtle control flow, long-range
dependencies, and unexpected patterns. This means that developers
should prioritize refactoring legacy code into modular, well-defined
units to take full advantage of AI.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DEXIE.JS (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Dexie.js is an IndexedDB wrapper that makes database interactions
simple, offers easy syncing, and integrates easily with frameworks
like React and Angular. 

 SQLITE PAGE EXPLORER (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 SQLite Page Explorer is an application that allows users to visually
explore SQLite databases page by page. It shows insights on data
storage, indexes, and database efficiency. 

 SIMPLE URL 🌐 TO SCREENSHOTS 📷 API (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This is a Python-based web scraping API that generates screenshots
and website data. The API handles redirects and downloads while
processing tasks in a queue with configurable memory limits. It uses
API keys for auth and returns a multipart response containing website
data, metadata, and up to five screenshots.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW I LEARNED TO CODE WITH MY VOICE (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Due to severe hand pain, this developer learned to code using voice
control software. She recommends a gradual approach using tools like
Talon Voice and Cursorless alongside Apple's Voice Control. She
started slowly by learning the Talon alphabet and progressed to more
complex tasks over time. 

 UNDERSTANDING REASONING LLMS (24 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 There are four main methods for building reasoning models, which are
LLMs that perform well on multi-step tasks. These methods are
inference-time scaling (increasing computational resources during
inference), pure reinforcement learning (RL), supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) combined with RL, and knowledge distillation via SFT of smaller
models. DeepSeek R1 models are a case study on the effectiveness of
SFT+RL. Distillation is great for cost-effective model development.

QUICK LINKS

 IT IS TIME TO STANDARDIZE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES FOR SOFTWARE
MEMORY SAFETY (23 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Standardizing principles and practices for software memory safety is
necessary to prevent widespread security vulnerabilities, which are
growing in number. 

 THE END OF PROGRAMMING AS WE KNOW IT (22 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI will not eliminate programmers, but rather transform their roles,
requiring them to adapt and develop new skills to properly use AI
tools to their fullest potential. 

 NONTRADITIONAL RED TEAMS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Red teams (groups of ethical hackers) are useful to have in the
development process for identifying potential issues like offensive
imagery, website compatibility with ad blockers, and flawed sign-in
forms.
