ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 POSTGRES AS A GRAPH DATABASE: (AB)USING PGROUTING (13 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 The pgRouting Postgres extension can be used to add graph
functionality to Postgres databases. While it's usually used for
geospatial routing, it can also be used for non-GIS use cases, such as
task scheduling using dependencies to find the critical path, reverse
proxy routing based on resource allocation, and building
recommendation engines like YouTube's. 

 HOW PREPLY IMPROVED INP ON A NEXT.JS APPLICATION WITHOUT REACT SERVER
COMPONENTS AND APP ROUTER (21 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Preply improved its INP (Interaction to Next Paint) through targeted
code improvements, React 18 upgrades, and strategic refactoring. Some
of the improvements that helped a lot include virtualizing long lists,
debouncing keyboard events, and memoizing heavy components.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING HAS STALLED (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Programming for distributed systems hasn't seen fundamental
improvements in the last decade. Current approaches rely on band-aids
over existing paradigms like external-distribution, static-location,
and arbitrary-location, each with limitations in performance, control,
or semantic clarity. There's a need for a new programming model that
is native to distributed systems that has things like semantic
locality and can surface potential issues from network delays and
faults. 

 THERE ISN'T MUCH POINT TO HTTP/2 PAST THE LOAD BALANCER (10 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 HTTP/2 support in Ruby HTTP servers like Puma isn't necessary because
its primary benefit, multiplexing, is most impactful over the internet
with high latency. Within a datacenter, the low latency between the
application server and load balancer takes away the advantage of
HTTP/2. Furthermore, features like server push, once a motivation for
end-to-end HTTP/2, have been abandoned, so HTTP/2 is best handled at
the infrastructure entry point (load balancer or reverse proxy) to
avoid unnecessary complexity within the application server.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING GPT 4.5 (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI has released a research preview of GPT-4.5, their new advanced
chat model. It's their biggest model yet, with improvements in its
ability to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate
insights. It also has more "EQ" and a better understanding of human
intent. However, it's much more expensive than GPT-4o, at a whopping
$75/1M input tokens. 

 YAAK (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Yaak is a modern, open-source API client designed for devs, with
offline functionality, Git integration, and extensibility through
NodeJS plugins. It supports API protocols like HTTP, GraphQL,
WebSockets, and gRPC, letting users authenticate, send dynamic
requests, and import data from other tools. 

 SUPERGLUE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 superglue is an open-source data connector for simpler interactions
with complex or legacy APIs. It automatically generates API
configurations and handles pagination, authentication, and retries,
while transforming data into a user-defined schema. It also validates
data compliance, automatically fixes broken transformations, and uses
LLMs for data mapping.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW YOUR MAC CAN UPDATE MACOS WHEN YOU DON'T WANT IT TO (6 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Macs can still update automatically in the background even with
automatic updates disabled. A forced update can be triggered by a
background activity scheduled by the DAS-CTS scheduling system, which
ignores user preferences. The process can bypass authentication and
offers no warning or opportunity to postpone, even conflicting with
scheduled backups. 

 SIDELOADING (34 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While the EU's DMA aimed to allow third-party app stores, Apple's
implementation includes stringent notarization requirements and fees
that basically prevent true sideloading. Hobbyist developers may find
some limited opportunities, but users outside the EU cannot access
these alternative apps, and sideloading's benefits, such as enabling
FOSS and repurposing older devices, remain unrealized on iOS due to
Apple's restrictions.

 SVADER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Svader is a library for creating GPU-rendered Svelte components using
WebGL and WebGPU fragment shaders. 

 PROBLY (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Probly is an AI-powered spreadsheet application built with Next.js
and Python that combines traditional spreadsheet functionality with
data analysis, visualization, and smart suggestions through the OpenAI
API. 

 IBM COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF HASHICORP, CREATES COMPREHENSIVE,
