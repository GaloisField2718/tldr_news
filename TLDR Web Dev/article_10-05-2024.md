 A good engineering conference is hard to come by. More often than
not, any real signal is buried under the noise of vendor pitches.

covered. Join your peers (in-person) and discover how the best
engineering leaders make it work.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY REACT RE-RENDERS (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Many developers work professionally with React for years without
understanding how its re-rendering process works. This tutorial helps
readers build a mental model for when and why React re-renders and how
to tell why a specific component re-rendered. Knowing how React's
render cycle works can help developers understand when to use
React.memo and when to wrap functions in useCallback. 

 PROTOBUF EDITIONS ARE HERE: DON'T PANIC (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google has introduced Protobuf Editions, a new feature flag system
that lets plugin maintainers granularly control the behavior of
generated APIs and runtimes. Editions combines existing proto2 and
proto3 functionality and is backwards-compatible. It is recommended
that developers stick with proto3 for now.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT'S THE BEST LOOKING/PERFORMING WEBSITE YOU'VE EVER SEEN? (REDDIT
THREAD) [9] 

 Web devs on Reddit give opinions on the best looking website they've
seen and why they're so good. Stripe and GitHub are common winners.
Animations are usually done with Lottie and the Web Animations API. 

 IT'S ALWAYS TCP_NODELAY. EVERY DAMN TIME (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Nagle's algorithm, designed in the 1980s to reduce network overhead
from small packets, often causes latency problems in modern
distributed systems. This developer argues that TCP_NODELAY (which
disables Nagle's algorithm) should be the default behavior on modern
systems.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CODEHELIUM (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 CodeHelium is a React editor component that compiles, executes, and
returns the outputs of any user-written Python code using WebAssembly.


 COMMAND-K (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Command-K Is a React component for command menus. You render items
within the menu and the component will automatically filter and sort
them. 

 TINY WORLD MAP (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 tinyworldmap is a lightweight map library for web apps that need to
function offline or on low-bandwidth connections. It integrates with
Leaflet and offers customization options like city labels and borders.

MISCELLANEOUS

 I REVIEWED 1,000S OF GRAPHQL VS. REST PERSPECTIVES (10 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 GraphQL has a great developer experience, but also introduces
complexity in areas like caching, access control, and performance
optimization. REST APIs are usually a better starting point for most
teams. 

 RUBY TYPING 2024: RBS, STEEP, RBS COLLECTIONS, SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS (7
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This developer wanted to add static type checking to their Ruby gem
but found RBS, the recommended approach, to be inconvenient. RBS
requires maintaining separate type definition files and has limited
support for tools like RSpec. Sorbet, an alternative approach, might
have been a better choice.

QUICK LINKS

 POSTGRES MESSAGE QUEUE (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Postgres Message Queue is a lightweight, open-source message queue. 

 ELLIPSIS (WEBSITE) [17]

GitHub comments into working, tested code. 

 A/B TESTING ON THE FRONT-END (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The Split SDK is used for A/B testing the front-end in two ways: 1)
loading both variations and using CSS to reveal the correct one
(avoiding flicker), and 2) using a loading page and then redirecting
the user to the appropriate variation.
