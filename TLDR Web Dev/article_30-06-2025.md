 HOW OAUTH WORKS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 A practical guide to OAuth Scoped Access that walks through the
Authorization Code Flow with real code examples, security best
practices, and clear explanations of how third-party app integrations
actually work. Learn more [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BLOOM FILTERS BY EXAMPLE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures that efficiently
check if an element might be in a set. They use a bit vector and
multiple hash functions to set bits when an element is added, allowing
for quick membership tests. While Bloom filters can definitively say
an element is not in the set, they may produce false positives due to
the possibility of different elements setting the same bits. 

 USING CLAUDE-SWARM TO UPGRADE RUBY PROJECTS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Claude-swarm is a tool that orchestrates multiple Claude AI instances
to do Ruby migrations for a large project. It can be set up to have a
"lead developer" AI instance identify projects with outdated Ruby
versions and delegate upgrade tasks to a "ruby_upgrader" AI
specialist. The tool successfully upgraded 5 Ruby projects from older
versions to Ruby 3.3.5 by automatically modifying Gemfiles and
configuration files.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I DELETED MY SECOND BRAIN (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Having an extensive "second brain" system can become a burden over
time, replacing actual thought and adding extra friction to life. This
author's new approach is having "no system at all," focusing on
presence, living knowledge, and trusting that meaningful ideas will
resurface naturally. 

 MCP: AN (ACCIDENTALLY) UNIVERSAL PLUGIN SYSTEM (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MCP is intended for AI and has the potential to become a universal
plugin system like USB-C. USB-C has unexpected versatility, and
similarly, MCP's standardized connection opens possibilities for other
types of apps. 

 TAILWIND IS THE WORST FORM OF CSS, EXCEPT FOR ALL THE OTHERS (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Tailwind CSS has drawbacks like verbose class names and a learning
curve, but is still great for teams. Its opinionated nature enforces
consistency and reduces decision fatigue.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DEBUGGING AI TAKES MORE THAN A STACK TRACE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Join the Sentry engineering team for a hands-on workshop [10] on
debugging AI-integrated applications and agents with full-stack
visibility. During the session you'll work hands on with Sentry to
spot broken code, model misbehavior, and silent failures before your
users do. Join live on July 9th [10] 

 OCTELIUM (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Octelium is a free platform that provides a unified solution for zero
trust resource access. It can function as a remote access VPN, ZTNA
platform, secure tunnel infrastructure, API/AI gateway, or PaaS. 

 SIRIUS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Sirius is a GPU-native SQL engine designed to integrate with existing
databases like DuckDB using the Substrait query format. It has huge
speedups, around 10x faster than CPU query engines, on TPC-H
benchmarks at the same cost, making it great for various data
workloads. The engine supports specific hardware and software
configurations, including Ubuntu, NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA, and CMake,
and can be deployed using AWS images, Docker, or manual installations.


 ZEQL+ (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 ZeQL+ is an open-source, cross-platform terminal-based SQLite
database browser. It allows users to open, browse, and query SQLite
databases directly from the command line without dependencies.

MISCELLANEOUS

 I MADE MY VM THINK IT HAS A CPU FAN (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This developer created a custom SMBIOS data file to trick a Xen
virtual machine into thinking it had a CPU fan. This involved defining
SMBIOS types 27 (Cooling Device) and 28 (Temperature Probe) by
analyzing the host system's SMBIOS data. 

 PROJECT VEND: CAN CLAUDE RUN A SMALL SHOP? (AND WHY DOES THAT
MATTER?) (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic conducted an experiment where Claude managed a small office
store called "Claudius" to understand AI's capabilities in real-world
economic scenarios. Claudius had strengths in identifying suppliers
and adapting to customer requests, but did not do well with profit
maximization. It hallucinated details, had bad inventory management,
and gave discounts for no reason. 

 ENGINEERED ADDICTIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Social media platforms, despite initial good intentions, inevitably
become addictive due to venture capital incentives that prioritize
growth and engagement. These platforms use algorithms to manipulate
users' emotions. Individual efforts like digital detoxes are not
enough.

QUICK LINKS

 MOST INTS ARE NOT FLOATS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Due to the limited precision of floating-point representations
(float32 and float64), most integers (int32 and int64) cannot be
represented exactly as floats, with only a small percentage (around
3.5% for 32-bit and 0.5% for 64-bit) being accurately convertible. 

 JAVASCRIPT™ TRADEMARK UPDATE (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Deno is pursuing a case to cancel Oracle's trademark of "JavaScript,"
arguing it is a generic term for the programming language and that
Oracle's use of it is misleading and restrictive. 

 ON ERROR HANDLING IN RUST (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Error handling in Rust should not be done with the common practice of
using large, all-encompassing error enums in crates, but rather by
using structs to represent individual errors. 

 HOW WE ACCIDENTALLY SOLVED ROBOTICS BY WATCHING 1 MILLION HOURS OF
YOUTUBE (7 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 These devs trained a neural network on 1 million hours of YouTube
videos to predict the next moment in reality, allowing robots to
understand physics, perform tasks in new environments, and potentially
surpass LLMs for real-world grounding.
