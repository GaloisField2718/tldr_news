ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SERVERFREE ARCHITECTURE (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A web application has server-free architecture when it doesn‚Äôt have
any backend servers, containers, or virtual machines. This can be
implemented using SQLite compiled to WebAssembly for database
operations, running backend code in a Web Worker, and using a Service
Worker to intercept requests and communicate with the Web Worker. A
server-free architecture offloads work from the backend and allows for
offline access to web applications. 

 FROM SLOW TO SIMD: A GO OPTIMIZATION STORY (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A function within Sourcegraph's Code AI tool, Cody, was recently
optimized to significantly increase its throughput and reduce memory
usage. The function calculates the dot product of two vectors. The
optimization journey involved various techniques like loop unrolling,
bounds-checking elimination, quantization, and SIMD (Single
Instruction Multiple Data) instructions. 

 4 STRATEGIES FOR MIGRATING MONOLITHIC APPS TO MICROSERVICES (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Best practices for migrating monolithic applications to microservices
in containerized Kubernetes environments include understanding the
monolith's dependencies, taking an incremental approach, loosely
coupling microservices, and implementing end-to-end observability.
DevOps teams are commonly under pressure to make this migration to
optimize the software delivery life cycle, reduce fragility, and
create shorter release cycles.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE SKILL THAT GETS YOU FIRED OR PROMOTED: MANAGING UP (9 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Managing up is the skill of influencing people who are more senior to
you, such as your direct manager. Failing to deliver on promises and
deadlines can lead to a lack of trust from your manager and
potentially getting fired. To manage up effectively, it‚Äôs important
to set realistic expectations, prioritize important promises, and
communicate openly with peers. 

 HIRING ONLY SENIORS IS THE WORST POLICY IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Companies should hire more junior engineers as they bring fresh
energy, motivation, and openness to new technologies to a team.
Juniors are necessary for long-term excellence in software
engineering. They should be paid fairly based on their skills and not
just years of experience, or else companies may lose their best
engineers over time.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TYPESPEC (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 TypeSpec is a language designed for describing cloud service APIs and
generating various assets, such as API description languages, client
and service code, and documentation. It offers extensible core
language features that can describe API structures commonly found in
REST, OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC, and other protocols. TypeSpec enables
the creation of reusable patterns for API design and allows for the
detection of known anti-patterns, helping API designers adhere to best
practices. 

 ATLAS (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Atlas is a browser-based tool that allows users to work with
geospatial data and share their results. It enables users to build
interactive maps, analyze data in the context of location, visualize
trends, facilitate teamwork and information sharing among GIS
professionals, and present plans and proposals in an easily
understandable format.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY IS MACHINE LEARNING 'HARD'? (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Difficulty in machine learning (ML) is not primarily due to
mathematics, but rather the need to build an intuition for selecting
the right tools and debugging. Debugging in ML is exponentially harder
than in standard software engineering due to multiple dimensions of
potential issues involving algorithms, implementation, data, and model
correctness. The long debugging cycles in ML, which can be days or
even weeks, make parallel experimentation necessary. 

 BOTTLENECK OF SCALEUPS #06: ONBOARDING (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A well-structured onboarding process not only grants access to new
hires, but also integrates new employees socially and culturally. A
bottleneck in the onboarding process can be identified by delays in
accessing tools and systems, the inability of new developers to make
production deployments quickly, newcomers feeling orphaned, excessive
focus on individual work, resistance to change, slow completion of
seemingly simple tasks, high turnover of newcomers, and documentation
that can't answer new hires' questions. An optimized onboarding
process maximizes the productivity of new employees. 

 UNBLOATING THE BUFFERS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Bufferbloat in computer networks can cause delays and glitches in
internet traffic, particularly during activities like video calls.
Bufferbloat occurs when network buffers fill up with data packets,
causing increased latency. Active Queue Management (AQM) techniques
like CAKE can be used to dynamically adjust and manage network queues,
resulting in more stable and responsive network performance.

QUICK LINKS

 THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF OFFLINE SUPPORT (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Full offline support can be supported through architectural
decisions, including multi-storage loading for speed and local
caching, grouped updates through an operations queue to optimize
real-time interactions, and a UI status system to inform users about
offline functionality. 

 MASTERING CRYPTOGRAPHY FUNDAMENTALS WITH NODE‚ÄôS CRYPTO MODULE (17
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 An introduction to core concepts in cryptography using code examples
with Node‚Äôs crypto module. 

 THE TREMENDOUS YET TROUBLED STATE OF GAMING IN 2024 (56 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 The gaming market had great public releases in 2023, but it also had
lots of layoffs and scrapped projects behind the scenes.
