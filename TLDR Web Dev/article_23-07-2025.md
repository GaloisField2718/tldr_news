ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DON'T ANIMATE HEIGHT! (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A performance issue in the Granola note-taking app was caused by
animating the `height` property in a CSS audio visualizer. Animating
`height` triggers expensive layout, paint, and composite steps in the
browser's rendering pipeline. To fix this, Granola replaced the
`height` animation with a `transform` animation using two rectangles,
achieving the visual effect of stretching without the performance hit.


 THE WORLD'S LONGEST REACT HOOKS MIGRATION (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Faire completed a massive migration from React class components and
MobX to functional components and hooks in 2025, despite hooks being
released in 2019. The company delayed the migration after switching to
MobX in 2018, but by 2022, its codebase had grown 5x larger while the
team only doubled, creating maintainability issues with bloated
"kitchen-sink" classes and performance problems from large bundle
sizes and poor caching. 

 I'M MORE PROUD OF THESE 128 KILOBYTES THAN ANYTHING I'VE BUILT SINCE
(8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This dev had to build a web application for users in Africa with poor
internet infrastructure, mostly using feature phones with 240px
screens and EDGE connections. They established strict constraints,
including a 128KB total page budget, compatibility with Opera Mini
browser, and responsive design from feature phones to 4K displays.
Despite the extreme limitations, these tight constraints led to better
solutions: they used system fonts instead of web fonts, built a
minimal custom library called "Whizz" instead of heavy frameworks, and
created an efficient AJAX-based navigation system that only loaded new
page content rather than full page reloads.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY I'M WRITING PURE HTML & CSS IN 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Using pure HTML and CSS in 2025 creates web pages that load
instantly, deploy easily, and never need security updates, while
modern websites have become bloated with an average size of 2.65MB.
Pure HTML pages have advantages, including evergreen compatibility
(HTML from 1991 still works today), better accessibility and SEO
through semantic tags, free hosting options, and no complex build
processes or dependency management. 

 REFLECTIONS ON PALANTIR (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Nabeel Qureshi's eight-year tenure at Palantir (2015-2023) was at the
same time the company transformed from being a relatively smaller
company to joining the S&P 500 with a nearly $100 billion market cap.
Palantir has a unique culture of intellectual intensity inherited from
the PayPal founders, with a forward-deployed engineer model where
engineers work directly at customer sites in difficult industries.
This approach let the company evolve from what appeared to be a
consulting firm into a genuine software product company.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 QWEN3-CODER: AGENTIC CODING IN THE WORLD (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Qwen Team has announced Qwen3-Coder, their most advanced agentic
coding model to date. It features a 480B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts
model with 35B active parameters and extended context length. The
model has state-of-the-art performance in Agentic Coding, Browser-Use,
and Tool-Use, on par with Claude Sonnet 4. Qwen Code, a command-line
tool adapted from Gemini Code, has also been released. 

 DAISYUI (WEBSITE) [11] 

 DaisyUI is a Tailwind CSS plugin that provides pre-built,
customizable component class names. It reduces the amount of code
needed by offering semantic class names, resulting in cleaner HTML and
smaller file sizes. 

 ANY LLM (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Any LLM is a Python library that provides a unified interface for
interacting with various LLM providers like Mistral and OpenAI. It
makes model switching easier and has developer-friendly features like
type hints and actionable error messages.

 MORE THAN YOU WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT HOW GAME BOY CARTRIDGES WORK (89
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article goes through the inner workings of Game Boy cartridges,
covering their architecture, memory management, and how they interact
with the Game Boy system. It explains fundamental components like ROM,
RAM, and Memory Bank Controllers (MBCs). It also explains how the Game
Boy addresses memory and how MBCs enable larger ROM sizes and
additional functionalities. 

 FUN WITH GZIP BOMBS AND EMAIL CLIENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Email clients are vulnerable to Gzip bombs, which are small
compressed files that expand to a massive size when decompressed. This
dev created a 10MB Gzip file that expands to 10GB and tested how
various email clients handle it when embedded as an image in an email.
Some clients like Firefox, Thunderbird, and Gmail's proxies bailed out
early, while others like Fastmail webmail's proxies downloaded a
partial amount before giving up. iOS Mail crashed.

 TODOS AREN'T FOR DOING (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 TODO comments in code are valuable not necessarily as tasks to be
completed, but as a way to capture context, edge cases, and potential
improvements for future developers. 

 I'VE LAUNCHED 37 PRODUCTS IN 5 YEARS AND NOT DOING THAT AGAIN (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Focusing on improving a single project with slow, steady growth is
more effective than constantly launching new ones in the hopes of
achieving virality. 

 I WATCHED GEMINI CLI HALLUCINATE AND DELETE MY FILES (9 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 A dev experimenting with the Gemini CLI experienced catastrophic data
loss when the AI hallucinated successful file operations,
misinterpreted error messages from failed commands, and deleted their
files by repeatedly overwriting them while attempting to move them to
a non-existent directory. 

 THE PERILS OF AN .XYZ DOMAIN (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Spot switched from the spot.xyz domain to spotvirtual.com to improve
email and SMS deliverability, user perception, firewall accessibility,
and social media sharing after experiencing issues with the .xyz
domain being associated with spam and malicious content.
