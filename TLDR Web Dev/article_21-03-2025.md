ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 LEAKING PASSWORDS (AND MORE!) ON MACOS (31 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 CVE-2024-54471 is a now-patched macOS vulnerability affecting
versions prior to macOS Sequoia 15.1, Sonoma 14.7.1, and Ventura
13.7.1. It allowed unauthorized access to file server credentials
stored in the macOS keychain through the NetAuthAgent daemon's MIG
server. Attackers could retrieve usernames and passwords, getting
access to corporate SSO credentials, user NAS drives, and sensitive
files. It also exposed iCloud API tokens, allowing attackers to steal
personal data, contacts, calendars, and even track locations. 

 MINDING THE GAPS: A NEW WAY TO DRAW SEPARATORS IN CSS (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 CSS gap decorations are a new proposal to simplify drawing separator
lines in layouts like Grid and Flexbox. The proposal extends the
`column-rule` property to other layout types and introduces
`row-rule`, which allows for gap decorations and control over their
appearance, including alternating colors and varying widths.
Additional properties like `*-rule-break` and `*-rule-outset` offer
fine-tuning of decoration behavior at intersections. 

 A DEEP DIVE INTO THE INLINE BACKGROUND OVERLAP PROBLEM (53 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The CSS inline background overlap problem is where semi-transparent
backgrounds on inline text with padding overlap and create darker
intersections. This problem can be fixed with an SVG filter, using
`feComponentTransfer` to restore transparency and blend the text on
top. However, a better approach involves setting shapes and RGBA
values in CSS and passing them to the SVG filter via different
channels/alpha points, so you get full CSS control over text and
background without hardcoding values in the SVG filter.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE FRONTEND TREADMILL (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Frontend teams should avoid rewriting their frontend with new
frameworks, as these frameworks become obsolete quickly. Instead,
teams should deeply understand their current framework and focus on
web fundamentals, which offer more long-term value and career
stability. The current frontend ecosystem is broken, making it
difficult for new developers to learn. 

 NEXT.JS VS TANSTACK (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Next.js is strong in its out-of-the-box setup and high-scale
optimization, but finds its APIs and cloud service features are often
unnecessary and complex for many applications. The app router also has
a steep learning curve, with debugging difficulties. On the other
hand, TanStack combined with Vite is simpler, clearer, and faster to
set up. 

 THE PAIN THAT IS GITHUB ACTIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Rewriting CI scripts in GitHub Actions is a frustrating experience,
especially when having to deal with complex merge queues, multiple
runners, and various builds. Setting up seemingly basic software
practices is a challenge due to hidden gotchas, inconsistent behavior,
and poor debugging tools. There are also security concerns because of
the complex and confusing security model involving tokens and
permissions, alongside the risks of using Docker containers with
GitHub Actions due to file permission issues and limitations.

 WHY REACT IS SURPRISINGLY THE BEST MODEL FOR LLM WORKFLOWS (11 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 React's component-based model is surprisingly well-suited for
building complex, backend LLM workflows, agents, and durable
applications. Current LLM frameworks are often criticized for being
Python-centric, relying on inflexible static graphs and problematic
global state management. However, using React's data model with
unidirectional data flow across all use cases makes React's model a
much better approach for LLMs. 

 HOW I ACCEPTED MYSELF INTO CANADA'S LARGEST AI HACKATHON (5 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 This developer found a vulnerability in the GenAI Genesis 2025
hackathon application website, hosted on Firebase. After realizing the
site retrieved and parsed all user application data, they manipulated
their application status to "accepted" by directly updating the
database. They later discovered an information leakage issue where
sensitive reviewer data could be accessed. 

 DIAGRAMS AI CAN, AND CANNOT, GENERATE (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI is great at creating generic diagrams and assisting with
whiteboarding new systems using tools like ChatGPT. However, it
currently struggles to accurately diagram real-life, existing systems
from source code due to challenges in training data, code analysis,
and understanding system intent.

 2FA OR NOT 2FA (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Strong, memorable passwords, combined with password management
strategies, can be more secure and convenient for individual users
than relying on 2FA, which introduces extra points of failure due to
needing secondary devices and recovery processes. 

 OPENAI.FM (WEBSITE) [17] 

 An interactive demo for developers to try the new text-to-speech
model in the OpenAI API. 

 PUSHING SIDE PROJECTS FORWARD WITH ALMOST NO FREE TIME (2 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 To make progress with side projects with limited free time, break
down large tasks into small, easily achievable actions to maintain
momentum and avoid feeling overwhelmed. 

 95% AI-WRITTEN CODE? UNPACKING THE Y COMBINATOR CEO'S DEVELOPER JOBS
BOMBSHELL (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Y Combinator's CEO claims that 25% of the accelerator's startups are
launching with 95% AI-written code, which has led to smaller
engineering teams, faster profitability pressure, and a shift in the
roles of human engineers towards AI oversight and complex
problem-solving.
