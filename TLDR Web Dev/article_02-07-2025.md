 HOW TO TAKE SCREENSHOTS OF YOUR STATICALLY EXPORTED NEXT.JS SITE IN
GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 GitHub Actions can be used to automatically take screenshots of a
statically exported Next.js website during pull requests, solving the
problem of not having preview deployments when hosting on GitHub
Pages. The solution uses a Node.js script using Puppeteer to find all
HTML pages in the built Next.js app, serve them locally, and capture
full-page screenshots while handling lazy-loaded images and
animations. The screenshots are then uploaded as GitHub Actions
artifacts. 

 GRAPH THEORY APPLICATIONS IN VIDEO GAMES (27 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Graph theory is applied in video games with 3D graphics, race game
lap counting, and maze generation. Graph theory concepts, such as
Hamiltonian circuits and disjoint-sets, efficiently solve problems in
game design.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HIDDEN COMPLEXITY IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Software development often has unexpected hidden complexity. A
reliance on unstable foundations and a "worse is better" mentality
leads to unpredictable and frustrating development experiences. This
is made worse when relying on tools maintained and built by others in
your software. 

 3 ENGINEERING TIPS FOR EVALUATING AI CODING TOOLS (8 MINUTE READ) [7]


 When evaluating AI coding tools, prioritize junior engineers over
senior ones in evaluations, since research shows junior devs achieve
2-3x better productivity improvements (21-40% vs 7-16%) because they
embrace simpler approaches. Also, use informal Slack channels and bots
for real-time qualitative feedback and create organic, unpolished
video content of engineers actually working with AI tools for better
AI adoption. 

 GO SHOULD BE MORE OPINIONATED (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Go should provide more opinionated guidance on application structure
and project layout, similar to how it enforces formatting with `go
fmt` and has strong opinions on other language features. While Go is
easy to learn due to its "one way to do things" philosophy, teams
struggle when scaling beyond small projects because they must invest a
lot of time figuring out how to structure larger applications without
official guidance.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FAULTORDERING (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 FaultOrdering is a Swift package that speeds up iOS app launch times
by generating order files that optimize how code is loaded into
memory. Order files work by instructing the linker to group
startup-critical symbols together in the binary, reducing page faults
and the number of memory pages needed during app launch. This is a
technique already used by major apps like Snapchat, Airbnb, and
Spotify. 

 OPENFLOW (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 OpenFLOW is an open-source Progressive Web App built with React and
Isoflow that allows users to create isometric diagrams directly in
their browser. It has auto-saving, privacy-first local storage, and
import/export capabilities for diagrams in JSON format.

 WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM HISTORY'S MOST BIZARRE SOFTWARE BUGS? (9
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 History has had catastrophic failures due to software bugs, like the
Boeing 737 MAX crash and NASA's $125 million Mars orbiter loss due to
unit confusion. There were also amusing bugs, like Google accidentally
marking every website as dangerous due to a single typo. Complex
systems rarely fail from a single cause but from cascading chain
reactions. 

 CAN AI REBUILD A RAILS PAGE IN NEXT.JS? WE TRIED IT (3 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 An experiment was conducted to rebuild a Rails application page in
Next.js using AI assistance through Cursor. After three attempts with
different AI models and refined prompts, they came very close to
success, with the result just missing one line (“use client”).
Prompt specificity and approach matter a lot for getting usable
results.

 TIPS FOR MAKING REGULAR EXPRESSIONS EASIER TO USE IN JAVASCRIPT (7
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tips for making JavaScript regular expressions more readable and
maintainable include using the `/v` flag, alphabetical flag ordering,
named capture groups, inline comments (via libraries), and proper
documentation examples. 

 VITE 7.0 IS OUT! (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Vite 7 has Rolldown integration, new Vite DevTools, updated Node.js
and browser support, Vitest compatibility, and experimental
Environment API improvements. 

 A SIMPLE WEBSITE (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This website is a nostalgic tribute to the simple, early 2000s web
development era, with basic HTML, limited CSS and JavaScript, low
screen resolutions, and creative workarounds for achieving basic
layouts and animations.
