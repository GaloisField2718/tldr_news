ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 TRACKING SUPERMARKET PRICES WITH PLAYWRIGHT (11 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This article goes through the process of building a website for
tracking supermarket prices in Greece. The main challenge was scraping
JavaScript-heavy websites, which was solved using Playwright. The
scraping pipeline was automated using Concourse CI and ran on a
Hetzner server, with the author's old laptop acting as an exit node to
avoid IP restrictions. 

 FULL TEXT SEARCH OVER POSTGRES: ELASTICSEARCH VS. ALTERNATIVES (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article compares different full text search (FTS) options for
Postgres databases, focusing on Elasticsearch and Postgres' native
FTS. While Postgres FTS is simple and real-time, it lacks features and
performs poorly on large datasets. Elasticsearch requires ETL
pipelines, leading to data freshness issues and operational overhead.
The article introduces and compares alternative search engines like
Algolia, Meilisearch, ParadeDB, and Typesense.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT'S HIDDEN BEHIND "JUST IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS" (12 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The phrase "just implementation details" often underestimates the
complexity and difficulty involved in building and deploying software.
Designing good software involves challenges like designing a
maintainable system, having robustness and observability, and
providing a good user experience. The perception that "CRUD"
applications are simple is not true since they also require careful
database design, production support, and handling of background jobs,
user logins, and permissions. 

 "20% FOR TECH DEBT" DOESN'T WORK (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Dedicating 20% of engineering capacity to technical debt doesn't work
as effectively as it seems. This article highlights five common traps
that hinder this approach, such as creating separate backlogs for
product and tech, failing to communicate the value of technical work,
and diluting focus on specific initiatives. Technical work should be
integrated into the product roadmap and clearly demonstrate its
business value in order to actually be prioritized. 

 DOES ANYONE REALLY USE ANGULAR ANYMORE? (REDDIT THREAD) [8] 

 Angular is still used in enterprise-scale applications a lot, such as
in banks and government agencies. React is seemingly more popular with
startups and scale-ups though.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING STRUCTURED OUTPUTS IN THE API (28 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI has introduced Structured Outputs in its API, allowing
developers to have model-generated outputs adhere to provided JSON
schemas. This guarantees output consistency and format compliance.
It's available in the API today. 

 FLEAK (WEBSITE) [10] 

 Fleak is a low-code serverless API Builder for data teams that
requires no infrastructure and allows you to embed API endpoints to

allows you to easily send emails from your applications.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ALL THE SPICIEST PARTS OF THE GOOGLE ANTITRUST RULING (10 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 The US v. Google antitrust ruling revealed that Apple considers Bing
an inferior search engine and wouldn't switch to it, even for a huge
payment. The judge declared that TikTok and other social media
platforms are not competitors to Google Search because they lack the
ability to index the entire web. The ruling further stated that AI
search technology is not yet advanced enough to replace traditional
search engine methods - this was used to justify the final call that
Google is a monopoly. 

 THERE IS NO MYSTERY OVER WHO WROTE THE BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH, DESPITE
WHAT SOME MAY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Blue Screen of Death, a notorious part of Microsoft's history,
has a clear authorship for each of its iterations. Steve Ballmer is
credited with the text of the error message in Windows 3.1, which was
not a true "blue screen of death" as it displayed a black screen with
an error message. The Windows 95 kernel error was actually brought to
its final form by Raymond Chen. John Vert is the author of the true
"blue screen of death" associated with Windows NT. 

 CAN WE TRUST MICROSOFT WITH OPEN SOURCE? (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There was a controversy surrounding Microsoft's commitment to
open-source development, specifically regarding the .NET framework.
Microsoft was seemingly starting to shift away from open-source
practices by removing features like "Hot Reload" from the .NET SDK and
making them exclusive to Visual Studio. However, the community's
strong reaction to this prompted Microsoft to reverse its decision and
bring back Hot Reload as an open-source feature.

move, how an ALU functions, and the basic fetch-decode-execute cycle.
