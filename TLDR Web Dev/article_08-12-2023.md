 UPGRADING GITHUB.COM TO MYSQL 8.0 (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 GitHub successfully upgraded its fleet of 1200+ MySQL hosts to
version 8.0, which was a challenging task due to the complexity of its
ecosystem. Key challenges included ensuring backward replication and
identifying queries that passed CI but failed in production. In this
post, GitHub‚Äôs team describes how they addressed these challenges.
The experience led to the development of new processes and operational
capabilities for managing the MySQL fleet, with a focus on automation
and self-healing capabilities for future upgrades. 

 API-FIRST APPROACH TO KAFKA TOPIC CREATION (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DoorDash's Engineering teams have improved Kafka Topic creation with
an in-house API that has significantly reduced the time it takes to
onboard real-time pipelines by 95% and saved developer hours. The
Real-Time Streaming Platform (RTSP) team at DoorDash manages over
2,500 Kafka Topics across five clusters, processing nearly six billion
messages per day. The new architecture automates Kafka resource
creation, integrates with internal infrastructure services, and
leverages super-user accounts to streamline the process.

its impact objectively, and providing actionable steps for
improvement. 

 DATABASES ARE THE ENDGAME FOR DATA-ORIENTED DESIGN (12 MINUTE READ)

modeling challenges. This article introduces data-oriented design as a
programming paradigm focused on efficient data transformation.
Databases, particularly those optimized for in-memory operations, can
be powerful tools for organizing and processing application data.

Cloud. It uncovered a flaw in Google Cloud‚Äôs userspace-to-kernel
