ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DISTRIBUTED SQLITE: PARADIGM SHIFT OR HYPE? (6 MINUTE READ) [3] 

 Distributed SQLite databases sacrifice consistency, transactions, and
scalability. Traditional databases like PostgreSQL, paired with
effective HTTP caching for speed, are better choices than using
distributed SQLite. The upside to SQLite databases is that they are
really fast, but at some point, the maintenance overhead outweighs the
speed benefits. 

 HOW DOES USEOPTIMISTIC() WORK INTERNALLY IN REACT? (29 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Optimistic UI is a technique used to improve the perceived
performance of web applications by updating the UI instantly in
response to user actions, even before getting a response from the
server. React's experimental hook useOptimistic() simplifies the
implementation of Optimistic UI by providing a way to manage temporary
optimistic state alongside the true state. Internally, useOptimistic()
leverages React's update mechanism but adds a special revertLane for
easy switching between optimistic and true states. 

 HOW TO THINK ABOUT HTML RESPONSIVE IMAGES (18 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Responsive images in HTML are a way to provide multiple versions of
an image, optimized for different screen sizes, resolutions, and
layout conditions. The browser will automatically select the most
appropriate image source for the current display and layout. To
implement responsive images, you can use the srcset and sizes
attributes on the `img` element, or use the `picture` and `source`
elements for more advanced techniques like art direction. Modern
browsers also support features such as lazy loading with sizes=auto.

 HOW TO MAKE ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Architects should help guide engineering teams by making strategic,
high-impact decisions while still allowing team members to have
ownership of various parts of the team‚Äôs overall work. This means
carefully considering decisions and their reversibility, along with
documenting potential impact before acting.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ‚úã STOP RELEASING BUGS (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows [9] are tested before
shipping. But how do you get that kind of coverage? You either spend
years scaling in-house QA ‚Äî or you get there in just 4 months with
QA Wolf [9]:

	* No hourly charges.
	* Guaranteed results.
	* All the tooling and infrastructure needed to run a 15-minute QA
cycle.

 MAJOR DATA CENTER POWER FAILURE (AGAIN): CLOUDFLARE CODE ORANGE
TESTED (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Cloudflare experienced a major power failure at a critical data
