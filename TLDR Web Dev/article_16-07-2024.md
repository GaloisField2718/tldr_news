ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FOG OF WAR (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Remix's "Fog of War" feature dynamically loads route information
based on user interactions. This optimizes React Router SSR
applications by decoupling rendering from fetching, resulting in a
"fetch then render" approach that eliminates network waterfalls. It
uses a Route Manifest to prefetch route data and components so that
navigation is smooth. 

 HOW WE TAMED NODE.JS EVENT LOOP LAG: A DEEPDIVE (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Trigger encountered reliability and performance issues in its Node.js
application due to event loop lag, which led to high CPU usage and
crashes. To fix this, it fixed inefficient code, added pagination, and
monitored event loop lag with OpenTelemetry. Moving forward, it will
keep an eye on larger payloads, as a learning from this experience. 

 HOW BOOKING.COM SCALED THEIR CUSTOMER REVIEW SYSTEM (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Booking.com scaled its customer review system by sharding reviews
across multiple servers using the internal ID of accommodations as the
partition key. When it needed to add more machines to the cluster due
to increased traffic, it used the Jump Hash Sharding algorithm to
minimize the amount of data that needed to be rearranged. This
algorithm guaranteed monotonicity, meaning that data was only
transferred from old shards to new shards during resharding, avoiding
unnecessary data movement.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 USE A WORK JOURNAL TO RECOVER FOCUS FASTER AND CLARIFY YOUR THOUGHTS
(5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 It can be hard to maintain focus, especially when switching between
tasks. Keeping a work journal to record your thoughts and actions can
help you think more clearly and regain context faster. Writing down
what you're doing and reading the last few sentences when resuming
work can be a helpful tool for improving focus. 

 THE GHOST JOBS HAUNTING YOUR CAREER SEARCH (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ghost jobs are job postings that companies don't intend to fill.
Companies post ghost jobs for various reasons like wanting to hire
eventually, maintaining a talent pool, or creating a false impression
of company growth. To avoid ghost jobs, job seekers should be wary of
vague job descriptions, old listings, and companies with little online
presence.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SIMPLIFY YOUR DATA COLLECTION WITH A FULLY INTEGRATED FORM MANAGEMENT
PLATFORM. BUILD BETTER FORMS, FASTER (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Discover¬†SurveyJS [9], an open-source JavaScript library suite for
secure form creation and data collection in your application. Build
complex JSON-driven surveys and forms quickly and without manual
coding. Collect and store responses while retaining full control over
your data. Integrate with any backend system. Enjoy a configurable
drag-and-drop interface and a CSS theme editor for precise form
styling. Start with the free, full-featured demo [10] 

 SCALE LANG (WEBSITE) [11] 

 SCALE is a GPGPU programming toolkit that allows CUDA applications to
be natively compiled for AMD GPUs. It does not require the CUDA
program or its build system to be modified. 

 CLAUDE DEV (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Claude Dev is a VSCode extension that can handle complex software
development tasks step-by-step. It can read & write files, create
entire projects from scratch, and execute terminal commands (after you
grant permission). Claude Dev can assist you in ways that go beyond
simple code completion or tech support. 

 PR PILOT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 PR Pilot is an AI agent for your development workflow that can search
and manipulate the code base, browse the internet, and interact with
GitHub issues and pull requests.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY FACEBOOK DOESN'T USE GIT (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Facebook chose Mercurial over Git because Mercurial is written in a
more modular way that makes it easier to extend. Additionally, back
when Facebook adopted Mercurial, its developer community was more
helpful in addressing Facebook's specific scaling problems. However,
it is true that Git is a familiar tool for many engineers, and
Mercurial was not necessarily the faster choice out of the box. 

 SAFEGUARDING APP HEALTH AND CONSUMER EXPERIENCE WITH METRIC-AWARE
ROLLOUTS (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 DoorDash uses metric-aware rollouts to automatically detect and
address app quality degradation during experiment rollouts. This new
feature allows for faster response to issues and a much better
customer experience by automatically pausing rollouts and alerting
experiment owners when app quality degradation is detected. 

 IT'S ABOUT TIME I TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHAT PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT
ACTUALLY IS (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Progressive enhancement is a design and development principle where a
website is built in layers, starting with a solid baseline experience
for all users and progressively adding enhancements based on browser
capabilities. This approach prioritizes functionality and
accessibility for all users, regardless of their device or browser,
and uses JavaScript as an enhancement rather than a requirement. This
is the opposite of graceful degradation, where a "perfect" experience
is designed and then broken down for less capable browsers,
potentially resulting in a broken user interface.

 MAKO (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Mako is a new open-source front-end build tool based on Rust. 

 IS TYPESCRIPT JUST A LINTER? (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 TypeScript is not just a linter but a typed language built on
JavaScript, with the ability to infer types and act as a linter due to
the presence of the 'any' type. 

 I'M NOT A FAN OF STRLCPY(3) (7 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The strlcpy function in C is inefficient - use memccpy, memcpy, or
strdup instead. 

 THE GRAYING OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY NEEDS FRESH BLOOD (4 MINUTE READ)
[20] 

 The open source community needs to attract younger developers to
maintain and improve existing projects as many experienced programmers
are aging and burning out.
