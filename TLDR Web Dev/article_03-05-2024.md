ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHAT EVERY DEVELOPER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CACHE COHERENCE (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Cache coherence makes sure that data stays consistent across multiple
caches in distributed systems. There are two types of cache coherence
protocols: snooping and directory-based protocols. In snooping
protocols, caches "listen" on a bus, updating or invalidating copies
based on other caches' actions. In directory-based protocols, a
central directory tracks data location and state, coordinating updates
and invalidations. 

 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE NODE.JS PERFORMANCE API (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This is a detailed breakdown of the Node.js Performance API, which
can be used to track performance metrics, add custom metrics, and view
network timing data for resources fetched by your app. It covers
multiple methods of the API, such as mark(), which adds markers to the
timeline, and measure(), which calculates the duration between two
markers. 

 A NEW APPROACH TO STATE MANAGEMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Signals are variables that automatically track where they're used,
updating the UI only when their value changes. This offers finer
control over UI updates compared to React's top-down re-rendering. A
proposal for Signals as a native JavaScript feature has reached Stage
1, which means that it could be standardized across frameworks.
There's a library called use-signals which shows how Signals can fit
into React while still letting React be React.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ASK HN: GUIDELINES FOR MAKING CLEAR ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAMS (HACKER
NEWS THREAD) [8] 

 To make clear engineering architecture diagrams, choose the right
diagram type for your concept and prioritize the core elements. Don't
try to express everything in one diagram. 

 HOW TO LEARN DATA ENGINEERING MORE EFFECTIVELY (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To learn data engineering effectively, be consistent by setting small
goals daily. Portfolio projects also matter when getting hired,
especially if you're an entry-level engineer. Communities are useful
to learn more and have support on tough days or weeks.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 YC-BACKED CODECRAFTERS LETS DEVELOPERS PRACTICE WRITING COMPLEX
SOFTWARE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Remember how much you enjoyed programming challenges early in your
career? CodeCrafters [11] lets you keep practicing and learning with
advanced challenges [11] designed by world-class experts. If you ever
wanted to recreate Redis, Git, or Docker [11] with your own hands just
for the heck of it, this is for you. Try your first CodeCrafters
challenge (and gain an edge in your career) [11] 

 FILEKITTY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 FileKitty lets you select multiple files from a directory and merge
them into a single file. This is ideal for combining files before
using them in a single format or for easily pasting file contents into
an LLM to provide context. 

 MORPHIC (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Morphic is an open-source AI-powered search engine with a generative
UI.

 GOOGLE LAYOFFS CONTINUE AS CUTS HIT FLUTTER, DART, AND PYTHON TEAMS
(8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's new round of layoffs affects teams working on Flutter, Dart,
and Python. Flutter's co-founder recently left Google, which makes the
future of Flutter and Dart more uncertain. The entire US-based Python
team has been disbanded, with work potentially shifting to Munich in a
cost-cutting move. 

 EXPLORING LLM WEIRDNESS: HOW WE BUILT IT & WHAT I LEARNED (7 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Josh Watzman, a software engineer at Facebook, and his coworker built
an LLM-powered quiz game that became popular online. They found LLM
APIs simple to use and found that for a good user experience, it was
best to immediately stream LLM responses. Since LLMs are functionally
text prediction tools, they are great for language tasks, but not as
good for interpreting non-textual information. Interestingly,
immediate streaming of LLM responses is crucial for a positive user
experience, even if it doesn't reduce overall response time.
