ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DEVELOPERS WANT MORE, MORE, MORE: THE 2024 RESULTS FROM STACK
OVERFLOW'S ANNUAL DEVELOPER SURVEY (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey revealed that JavaScript and
PostgreSQL remain the most popular technologies, while Rust and
Markdown are the most admired. Developers are increasingly frustrated
by technical debt at work, but they don't perceive AI as a threat to
their jobs. Although 76% of developers are using or planning to use AI
tools, many remain skeptical about their accuracy and ability to
handle complex tasks. 

 THE PROCESS THAT KEPT DYING (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article recounts the author's experience debugging a memory leak
in a Node.js application. The story began with intermittent "502 Bad
Gateway" errors on a crowdfunding website, leading the author to
suspect PM2, a process manager, as the culprit. After ruling out PM2,
the investigation focused on a memory leak within the Next.js
application. The author used tools like Chrome DevTools to take heap
snapshots and identified Moment.js as the source of the leak. It
simply needed to be upgraded to fix the leak. 

 HOW AIRBNB SMOOTHLY UPGRADES REACT (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Airbnb faced challenges upgrading its massive React codebase due to
dependency management and performance concerns. To overcome these, its
team developed a React Upgrade System that enabled incremental
upgrades, module aliasing, environment targeting, and rigorous
testing. The system allowed Airbnb to smoothly transition to React 18
while maintaining code quality and user experience.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AI CRAWLERS NEED TO BE MORE RESPECTFUL (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Read the Docs is experiencing a surge in abusive site crawling by AI
products and services, leading to significant bandwidth costs and time
spent dealing with abuse. These AI crawlers are aggressively
downloading content without basic checks, resulting in repeated
downloads of large files and heavy traffic from numerous IP addresses.
The company has been forced to block several sources of abusive
traffic and is facing financial strain due to the increased bandwidth
charges. 

 LET'S CONSIGN CAP TO THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The CAP theorem, a foundational concept in distributed systems, is
largely irrelevant for cloud-based applications. Cloud systems are
typically designed with redundant connectivity and routing mechanisms,
allowing them to offer both strong consistency and high availability
even in the presence of network partitions. Engineers should be
focusing on more practical trade-offs in cloud systems, such as
durability vs. latency and consistency vs. throughput, rather than
dwelling on the CAP theorem. 

 AI DIDN'T TAKE MY JOB (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Despite the hype surrounding AI's ability to replace developers, it
hasn't happened. While AI tools like GPT are impressive, they have
significant limitations, particularly in terms of memory and ability
to solve complex problems. The fear of AI replacing developers stems
from the misconception that GPT's rapid progress will continue
indefinitely and the human tendency to dwell on apocalyptic scenarios.

 AI ACHIEVES SILVER-MEDAL STANDARD SOLVING INTERNATIONAL MATHEMATICAL
OLYMPIAD PROBLEMS (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 DeepMind's AI systems, AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2, have achieved
a significant breakthrough in mathematical reasoning by solving four
out of six problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad,
earning a silver-medal level score. AlphaProof, a reinforcement
learning system, tackled problems in algebra and number theory, even
solving the most challenging problem. AlphaGeometry 2, an improved
version of its predecessor, did well in geometry, proving one of the
problems within 19 seconds. 

 THE BIZARRE SECRETS I FOUND INVESTIGATING CORRUPT WINAMP SKINS (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Jordan Eldredge, a Winamp enthusiast, discovered bizarre and
unexpected content while investigating seemingly corrupted Winamp
skins. He found encrypted files, personal messages, a hidden
biography, and even a worm game. His research led him to uncover 56
previously unknown Winamp skins hidden within others, proving that a
large enough collection of user-created content can reveal unexpected
and weird discoveries. 

 WHEN OBJECTS ARE NOT ENOUGH (20 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has changed a lot throughout the
years. ‚ÄúReal OOP‚Äù focuses on messaging, encapsulation, and late
binding, not just organizing code into classes and methods. While OOP
has its merits, it's not a silver bullet, and alternative approaches,
such as message broadcasting and the use of actions as objects, are
still useful solutions for complex systems.
