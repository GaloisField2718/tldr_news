 MIGRATING TO REACT NATIVE'S NEW ARCHITECTURE (2025) (8 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Shopify successfully migrated two of its largest apps (Shopify Mobile
and Shopify Point of Sale) to React Native's New Architecture while
maintaining weekly releases and serving millions of merchants. Its
strategy focused on minimizing code changes, maintaining dual
architecture compatibility during development, and making sure
performance stayed the same throughout the migration process. The team
ran into and fixed some issues like erroneous state batching, blank
screens, shadow tree manipulation problems, and view flattening side
effects. 

 AN INTERACTIVE GUIDE TO TANSTACK DB (22 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TanStack DB is a new member of the TanStack family designed to
improve TanStack Query. This article explains how TanStack DB
addresses limitations in TanStack Query through Collections, Live
Queries, and Transactional Mutations, with benefits like fine-grained
state updates and optimistic updates with less boilerplate. TanStack
DB integrates with sync engines like ElectricSQL for real-time data
synchronization and fast data loading. 

 REACT FAST REFRESH: NEXT-GEN HOT RELOADING EXPLAINED (8 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 React Fast Refresh is an official Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
solution that enables hot reloading while preserving application
state. When you edit React components, Fast Refresh updates only the
modified components and re-renders them while maintaining state in
functional components and Hooks, though it falls back to full reloads
for files that export non-React components or have syntax errors. The
system works through a combination of Babel compile-time
transformations that inject tracking code and a runtime system that
registers components and Hook signatures.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SOME THOUGHTS ON PERSONAL GIT HOSTING (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This dev experimented with hosting his personal Git projects on his
own instance, using PikaPod to manage the server. He faced challenges
moving away from GitHub, including network effects, difficulties with
forking and discoverability, administrative overhead, and the loss of
sponsorship opportunities. Despite these drawbacks, he plans to move
smaller repos to his personal server while leaving popular ones on
GitHub in order to try to decentralize his projects. 

 I'VE TRIED SOLID.JS, NOW I'M STARTING TO HATE REACT (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This dev recently started using Solid.js and now prefers it over
React. He found Solid.js's reactivity model initially challenging but
ultimately more efficient as it prevents unnecessary re-renders.
Solid.js also has closer alignment with web platform standards like
HTML.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW DO YOU ADD FREE TRIALS TO YOUR SAAS? (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Toggle it on. Clerk Billing does the rest. Introducing Free Trials in
Clerk Billing. Stop gluing together trial logic, cancellation flows,
and upgrade paths. 

 TERM.EVERYTHING (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Term.everything is a Linux CLI program that lets users run GUI
applications within their terminal by using a custom-built Wayland
compositor. It supports running applications over SSH and rendering
windows at varying resolutions, with the quality depending on the
terminal's row and column count. 

 HAYSTACK EDITOR (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Haystack is a GitHub app that streamlines code reviews for faster and
more confident merging. It provides a logical, contextual view of
changes, eliminating the need to jump between files.  Haystack also
has variable tracking and caller identification for supported
languages like Python, C++, and JavaScript. 

 RIPPLE (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Ripple is a TypeScript UI framework aimed at synthesizing the best
aspects of React, Solid, and Svelte into a single package. It has
reactive state management, a component-based architecture using
JSX-like syntax, and fine-grained rendering for optimal performance.
Ripple provides full TypeScript integration, VSCode support, and uses
native control flow statements within templates.

 THE ORIGIN STORY OF MERGE QUEUES (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Merge queues have evolved from niche solutions to an important part
of software engineering today. They help address the challenge of
maintaining a stable main branch with multiple developers integrating
code. Early experiments like Rust's Bors and Homu automated the
process of testing pull requests before merging, preventing
integration issues. This concept gained popularity until it became a
built-in feature in platforms like GitLab and GitHub. 

 WHY DO BROWSERS THROTTLE JAVASCRIPT TIMERS? (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 JavaScript's setTimeout(0) can actually run 4 milliseconds later. A
lot of websites spam setTimeout, so browsers set the delay to avoid
draining users' batteries or other issues. Developers could just use
other alternatives. While these options can still be abused, they are
permitted for now. 

 MICROSOFT GOES BACK TO BASIC, OPEN-SOURCES BILL GATES' CODE (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Microsoft has open-sourced the original Microsoft BASIC for the 6502
Version 1.1, a foundational piece of software written by Bill Gates
and Ric Weiland. This influential code has 6,955 lines of assembly
language and powered early personal computers like the Commodore and
Atari.

 HOW DOORDASH USES AI MODELS TO UNDERSTAND RESTAURANT MENUS (11 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 DoorDash uses a system that combines OCR, LLMs, and a guardrail model
to automate restaurant menu transcription from photos while routing
complex cases to human reviewers. 

 THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH A DEBUGGER BUT NOT WITH PRINT DEBUGGING (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Debuggers offer advantages over print debugging by allowing
developers to inspect the call stack, dynamically evaluate
expressions, catch exceptions at the source, alter execution without
code changes, and standardize project setup through debug
configurations. 

 QWEN3-CODER: IS THIS AGENTIC CLI SMARTER THAN SENIOR DEVS? (7 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Qwen3-Coder, Alibaba's new 480-billion parameter coding AI model that
functions as an "agentic CLI" tool, is capable of handling complex
multi-step coding tasks, web browsing, and tool integration with a
large 256K-1M token context window. 

 THE SCAM CALLED “YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER ANYTHING” (8 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 Relying on external tools like search engines and AI to avoid
memorization makes critical thinking and knowledge acquisition harder
in the long run.
