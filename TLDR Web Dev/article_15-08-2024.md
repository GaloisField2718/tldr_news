ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SORT, SWEEP, AND PRUNE: COLLISION DETECTION ALGORITHMS (13 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 This blog post explores collision detection algorithms in video
games. It starts by explaining the naive approach, which involves
checking every pair of objects for collisions, and its limitations in
terms of performance. It then introduces the concept of sorting
objects based on their position to reduce the number of unnecessary
checks. By sorting objects and implementing an early break condition,
the algorithm becomes more efficient, especially in scenarios where
objects are evenly distributed. 

 OPTIMIZING SPA LOAD TIMES WITH ASYNC CHUNKS PRELOADING (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 You can speed up client-side rendered apps by preloading the
necessary page chunks before they're needed, avoiding delays caused by
lazy loading. By injecting a small script during the build process,
you can make sure that route-specific chunks load in parallel with the
app's entry point. 

 MANAGING EFFECTS (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article introduces three key rules to manage React side effects
properly: keep side effects out of the render process, place side
effects triggered by events in event handlers, and use useEffect to
handle side effects that synchronize with external systems.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DEVELOPERS HATE THEIR JOB, BUT LIKE TO CODE OUTSIDE WORK (12 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Python are still the most used languages,
but Python has become the most desired, with developers increasingly
favoring it over JavaScript. AI tools are rapidly being adopted, with
most developers using them to write code, although many are still
cautious about relying on AI for testing. Most developers dislike
their jobs, but still enjoy the practice of coding. 

 MY CHATBOT BUILDER IS OVER-ENGINEERED, AND I LOVE IT (10 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This author, a solo developer, shares his experience building a
chatbot builder called Fastmind. He used React for the frontend, Hono
for the backend, and Convex for the database. The architecture has
separate frontend applications for the chatbot builder, chat widget,
and marketing website.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SOLUTION BRIEF: SYNTHETIC MONITORING + APM FOR A FLAWLESS END-USER
EXPERIENCE AND RELIABLE ENDPOINT UPTIME (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Finding the root cause of an issue gets harder the further down your
stack it is. The solution? Use Synthetic Monitoring [9] to run
self-healing tests that narrow your focus, and Datadog APM [9] to
collect distributed traces of requests across your backend services
and databases. See how it works [9] 

 RATE MY OPENAPI (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Rate My OpenAPI is a suite of tools designed to help software
developers using OpenAPI to design and implement their APIs. It makes

 HOW I WON $2,750 USING JAVASCRIPT, AI, AND A CAN OF WD-40 (20 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 This developer won $2,750 in a marketing video contest by using
JavaScript, AI tools like ChatGPT and Elevenlabs, and a strategic
understanding of the contest's rules. They identified key factors that
made the contest winnable, such as the judging criteria favoring video
entries and the availability of multiple prizes. The developer then
used Playwright to scrape the competition and determine which entries
were less likely to win based on quality and type. Finally, they used
ChatGPT to generate code for calculating their odds of winning based
on the number of entries submitted, leading them to submit eight
videos and win seven prizes. 

 INSIDE THE "3 BILLION PEOPLE" NATIONAL PUBLIC DATA BREACH (16 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 The complex situation surrounding the "National Public Data" data
breach involved the alleged leak of billions of records containing
personal information. The breach is difficult to analyze due to the
fragmented nature of the leaked data, which has been distributed in
various forms and sizes by anonymous actors. This author outlines the
different sets of data he has encountered, including social security
numbers, email addresses, and other personal information, and explores
the challenges of attributing the data back to its source. 

 THE PITFALLS OF IN-APP BROWSERS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In-app browsers, embedded within native mobile apps, often lack key
features, compromise user privacy, and offer inconsistent UI/UX,
leading to a suboptimal browsing experience.
