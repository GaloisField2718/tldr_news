ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE MADE OUR RICH TEXT EDITOR LOAD FASTER (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 CKEditor 5 initially struggled with performance issues when loading
large, complex documents due to its multi-layered architecture. To fix
these issues, its team reduced redundant conversions, improved tree
traversal, and batched operations. As a result, document load times
were reduced by 6–7x, showing the power of improving underlying
algorithms within code rather than focusing on JavaScript
micro-optimizations first. 

 SHARDING PGVECTOR (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pgvector is a PostgreSQL extension for vector embeddings. PgDog
scales `pgvector` by sharding the vector index. It distributes shards
across multiple machines by using IVFFlat's existing vector space
partitioning and K-means clustering, allowing for parallel queries
based on proximity to centroids. This improves search performance,
especially with larger datasets. 

 UI ALGORITHMS: A TINY UNDO STACK (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article shows a simple implementation of an undo/redo stack in
JavaScript. Instead of using a single stack with a pointer, the
implementation uses two separate stacks, "past" and "future", to
represent undoable and redoable actions, respectively, avoiding common
indexing errors. It also addresses the pass-by-reference issue in
JavaScript by using structuredClone() to guarantee that the undo and
redo functions operate on cloned copies of the data, maintaining
idempotency.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BREADCRUMBS ARE DEAD IN WEB DESIGN (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Breadcrumbs are obsolete in web design today due to the shift from
hierarchical navigation to dynamic, search-first, and AI-driven user
experiences. Mobile-first design, predictive navigation, and
personalized content recommendations have made traditional breadcrumb
trails redundant. 

 YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS BEFORE CHOOSING NEXT.JS (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Vercel tightly couples Next.js with its own infrastructure, which
prevents other providers from fully supporting the framework due to a
lack of adapters, official serverless support, and Vercel-specific
code paths. Its handling of a recent security vulnerability is
concerning as it delayed notifying other providers. 

 A LOVE LETTER TO THE CSV FORMAT (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CSV's strengths include its streamability, appendability, dynamic
typing, and the unique property of remaining valid when reversed,
which allows for efficient processing of the last rows. Its
often-overlooked advantages make it very valuable still, especially
when simplicity and flexibility are needed over features like strict
typing and column-oriented access.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SEMANTIC SEARCH EXCELLENCE — FROM FOUNDATIONAL TEXT SEARCH TO RAG
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Join the Elastic team to learn how to build search that understands
the meaning of a query, and the choices and options along this path:
foundational text search, RAG, vector databases, and using ESRE for
dynamically fine-tuning search relevance based on user behavior.
Attend live on April 23 [10] 

 COCOMMIT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Cocommit is a command-line tool that uses LLMs to analyze and improve
Git commit messages. It uses LangChain to support various LLM
providers, offering shortcuts for easy usage and customizable options
for different project needs. 

 HYPERLIGHT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Hyperlight is a lightweight, embeddable Virtual Machine Manager (VMM)
designed for securely running untrusted code within micro virtual
machines. It does this by using micro VMs without a kernel or OS,
using Hyperlight Guest library for interaction between host and guest
via defined APIs. 

 EXPO PASSKEY (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Expo Passkey is a plugin that allows secure passwordless
authentication in Expo apps using native biometrics. It has features
like key lifecycle management, a type-safe API, and UI components.

MISCELLANEOUS

 INSIDE GOOGLE'S TWO-YEAR FRENZY TO CATCH UP WITH OPENAI (29 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Google launched a 100-day sprint to develop a rival chatbot, Bard,
led by VP Sissie Hsiao in response to ChatGPT's release. It
reorganized its AI efforts by DeepMind and Google Brain to create the
Gemini model. Despite setbacks and internal anxieties along the way,
Google was able to integrate Gemini into its products and develop new
AI features to maintain its competitive edge. 

 THE WORM THAT NO COMPUTER SCIENTIST CAN CRACK (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The OpenWorm project, launched in 2011, has been attempting to create
a complete computer simulation of the C. elegans nematode, a simple
organism with only 302 neurons. Despite the worm's relative simplicity
and extensive research data, the project has struggled to produce a
realistic simulation. Researchers believe that successfully simulating
the worm could change our understanding of how brains and bodies
interact. 

 NODE.JS TSC VOTES TO STOP DISTRIBUTING COREPACK (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Node.js Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has voted to remove
Corepack from future Node.js releases (25+) due to low adoption rates,
distribution concerns, and the desire for package managers to evolve
independently. Corepack was initially introduced to bridge the gap
between different package managers.

QUICK LINKS

 MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (MCP) (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 OpenAI has added MCP support to its Agents SDK. 

 AN INTERVIEW WITH ZEN CHIEF ARCHITECT MIKE CLARK (16 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Mike Clark, the chief architect of AMD's Zen microarchitecture,
discusses various hardware design decisions and their relationship to
software development, x64 vs ARM, memory page sizes, CPU pipeline
diagrams, and how software developers can better use existing and
future hardware. 

 WHY KNOWING YOUR APP'S BUNDLE CONTENTS MATTERS FOR REACT NATIVE
PERFORMANCE (9 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Expo Atlas helps React Native devs optimize app performance by
providing insights into bundle contents, allowing them to identify and
remove unnecessary dependencies, reduce bundle size, and improve
startup time. 

 LAZY LOAD BACKGROUND IMAGES WITH THE INTERSECTIONOBSERVER API (12
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Lazy loading of background images can be done using the
IntersectionObserver API, which monitors when offscreen images are
about to become visible in the viewport and then loads them.
