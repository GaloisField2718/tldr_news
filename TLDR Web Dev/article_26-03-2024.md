ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE PROBLEM WITH USING A UUID PRIMARY KEY IN MYSQL (9 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 This article goes through the different versions of UUIDs and why
using them as a primary key in MySQL can hurt database performance.
Using UUIDs as primary keys can lead to slow insert performance,
higher storage requirements, and larger index size requirements (since
secondary indexes also store primary keys). To mitigate these issues,
UUIDs can be stored in a binary format or ordered using UUID v6 or v7.


 WHAT HAPPENS ON GITLAB WHEN YOU DO GIT PUSH? (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Git stores project history locally as objects and references (like
branches). When you use 'git push', and your git remote is with
GitLab, it sends these updates to a remote GitLab server. How you
connect (SSH or HTTP(S)) determines the authentication method: SSH
uses GitLab Shell for key-based verification, while HTTP(S) relies on
Workhorse and Rails for authentication. Once authenticated, Gitaly
takes over, managing your Git repository and executing
'git-receive-pack' to handle the incoming changes. Gitaly is used by
GitLab to read and write Git data. 

 LOW EFFORT IMAGE OPTIMIZATION TIPS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This is a tutorial on how to identify unoptimized images and how to
optimize them to improve your web application‚Äôs performance.
Developers should use modern formats like AVIF and WebP where possible
and size their images properly to match their rendered dimensions. The
`picture` element can be used with multiple image formats and
resolutions for the browser to automatically select the best fit.
Images below the fold should be lazy loaded.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO BUILD A CAREER YOU ENJOY AS AN ENGINEER. WHAT I WISH SOMEONE
TOLD ME WHEN I STARTED (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To progress in your career, focus on impactful projects that align
with your skills and interests rather than settling for easy tasks.
You should take control and proactively seek out high-impact projects
that contribute to company goals and your own career development.
These projects should challenge you and it‚Äôs easier to work on
something challenging if it‚Äôs also work that is meaningful to you,
aligns with your strengths, and has a significant impact on your
company. When you find an area you excel in, invest time and energy to
become an expert and the go-to in that area. 

 FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS EXPORT TO CSV (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CSV is a poor choice for storing and transferring tabular data due to
its ambiguity, performance issues, and lack of compression. Apache
Parquet is a better choice because it is self-describing, has
excellent compression, and can be loaded efficiently. 

 FROM FULL-STACK DEVELOPMENT TO SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 This developer describes their career journey, shifting from
full-stack development to specializing in systems programming. They
discovered a passion for the technical depth of systems programming
through projects focused on network protocols, tooling, and
performance optimization. As their focus changes, they wonder whether
it's possible to be both a generalist and a specialist.

 WHY I CHARGE A $100,000 SOFTWARE LICENSING FEE FOR 10 LINES OF CODE
(3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This developer creates novel, fundamental algorithms and data
structures designed to solve specific computing challenges and improve
performance. Unlike common open-source models, they license these
algorithms with a fee for use in closed-source projects, allowing them
to make a lot of money from organizations that can easily afford it. 

 RIP REDIS: HOW GARANTIA DATA PULLED OFF THE BIGGEST HEIST IN OPEN
SOURCE HISTORY (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The recent Redis license change by Redis Labs (aka Garantia Data) is
a harmful move that disregards the contributions of the wider Redis
community. Garantia Data didn't create Redis. Redis was initially an
independent open-source project and Garantia Data only became involved
years after its creation. Redis‚Äô widespread adoption was thanks to
the open-source community and Amazon‚Äôs ElastiCache, not due to the
company itself. 

 GOOGLE'S FIRST TENSOR PROCESSING UNIT - ARCHITECTURE (12 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Google designed the TPU v1 for fast, cost-effective inference using
trained neural network models at scale. Its key feature is a focus on
tensor operations, specifically matrix multiplications, which are core
to neural network computations. The TPU v1 is 15-30x faster than
contemporary CPUs/GPUs for inference. It has 25-29x better performance
per watt than GPUs.

 THE ALLURE OF LOCAL-FIRST SYNC ENGINES (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Local-first sync engines revolutionize data management the way React
transformed DOM manipulation: both shift from manually writing
instructions (imperative) to simply declaring the desired state
(declarative), with the engine handling the 'how' of syncing or
rendering changes. 

 TWO OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS WITH GREAT DOCUMENTATION (8 MINUTE READ)
[20] 

 esbuild and Redis are examples of open-source projects with great
documentation that includes READMEs, architecture explanations,
changelogs, and code comments. 

 NEWLY SENIOR ENGINEER, BUT I DON‚ÄôT FEEL SENIOR. I HAVE BIG GAPING
HOLES WITH REGARD TO HOW TO STRUCTURE/REFACTOR CODE AND BUILD SYSTEMS
(REDDIT THREAD) [21] 

 Understanding the scope of what you don‚Äôt know is an important part
of the senior mindset. Seniors should focus on their strengths while
working to fill in their gaps. 

 WHEN APPLE CONSIDERED BUYING BING (6 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Apple executives discussed buying or partnering with Microsoft Bing,
but they had concerns about its smaller market share and potential
challenges in catching up to Google's dominance.
