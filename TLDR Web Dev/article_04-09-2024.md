 DESIGN TO CODE: USING AI TO SHIP WEBSITES AND APPS WITH ENORMOUS
EFFICIENCY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Are you struggling with lengthy turnaround times for website and app
updates?

Developers know the struggle of picking the right components (or
reinventing the wheel) when it comes to coding new designs. Meanwhile,
business teams are held back from going live, and everyone is annoyed.

In 2024, this shouldn't be the case. Not when you can use AI to go
from design to live [4] with enormous efficiency.

Read the design-to-code tooling guide [4] to learn:

 	* The impact of design-to-code on workflows and productivity
 	* Going from design to live in half the time
 	* Practical implementation steps

 THIS CRAZY SYNTAX LETS YOU GET AN ARRAY ELEMENT'S TYPE (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 You can extract the type of an array element in TypeScript using the
"Array[number]" syntax, which can be useful for creating enums from
arrays and extracting specific types from complex data structures.
This technique is called an indexed access type, which lets you access
a property on a type by its key. In the case of arrays, using "number"
as the key retrieves the type of the array's elements. 

 WIKIMEDIA SLASHED 300MS OFF EVERY WASM EXECUTION WITH WASMEDGE (7
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Wikifunctions, a Wikimedia Foundation project under development, made
improvements in system performance, particularly in the speed of
function calls. Its team pre-loaded WASM into a pool of ready threads,
which led to faster single and saturated requests. They also
implemented a variety of front-end improvements, bug fixes, and code
enhancements, including a re-write of front-end styling code and a
feature flag for WikiLambda code installation on other wikis. 

 BRAND NEW PERFORMANCE FEATURES IN CHROME DEVTOOLS (21 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The new Performance Panel features in Chrome DevTools provide
detailed insights and tools for optimizing Core Web Vitals and overall
web performance. This tutorial explains how to access and configure
these features. It also goes over how to interpret lab and field data,
along with practical tips for fixing LCP, CLS, and INP issues using
the new Performance Panel features.

 SANDING UI (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ‚ÄúSanding‚Äù a user interface involves repeatedly clicking through
the UI, testing its functionality, and identifying any issues or
"splinters" that might disrupt user experience. As an example, a
developer encountered a problem where a gap in a flexbox layout
created a dead zone that prevented users from interacting with a radio
button. By removing the gap and adding padding to the label, he
eliminated the problem and smoothed out the user experience. 

 MY TECH PROMOTION ALGORITHM (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Steve Huynh, a former Amazon Principal Engineer, shares his "Tech
Promotion Algorithm," a three-step strategy for career advancement.
The algorithm encourages engineers to identify their biggest gaps in
skills and performance, formulate a plan by working backward from
desired evidence of success, and then execute the plan while seeking
regular feedback. 

 NEXT.JS + SUPABASE APP IN PRODUCTION: WHAT WOULD I DO DIFFERENTLY (13
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This developer built a mid-sized Next.js application with Supabase
and, as a result, he recommends using server components for data
fetching, server actions for data mutations, and shared utility
wrappers for authorization, validation, and authentication. In terms
of database design, the developer emphasizes the importance of using
surrogate keys, implementing row-level security (RLS) in a performant
way, and utilizing server-side routing for mutations.

 HOW NAVY CHIEFS CONSPIRED TO GET THEMSELVES ILLEGAL WARSHIP WI-FI (16
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The senior enlisted leaders of the USS Manchester secretly installed
a Starlink Wi-Fi network during a deployment for their exclusive use
while rank-and-file sailors were denied internet access. The network,
dubbed "STINKY", was installed without authorization and posed
significant risks to the ship's security and operations. Command
Senior Chief Grisel Marrero, the orchestrator of the scheme, was
convicted at court-martial and reduced in rank.

Templates, for template inheritance and Rebar3's compiler for
incremental rebuilds, ensuring only necessary files are recompiled.
