 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PREDICTIVE CI: WHY SMART TEAMS ARE ALREADY MAKING THE SWITCH (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI coding agents are rapidly increasing code generation, shifting
engineers' focus to reviewing AI-written code, which is more
challenging than writing it. Current testing methods struggle to
address the nuances and potential issues in AI-generated code.
Predictive CI uses AI to proactively generate tests, identify
regressions, and suggest fixes, which leads to better code reliability
and reduces engineer workload. 

 BOOKMARKABLE BY DESIGN: URL-DRIVEN STATE IN HTMX (5 MINUTE READ) [10]


 The URL can be used as the primary source of truth for application
state in HTMX applications. By using URL parameters for filters,
sorting, and pagination, devs can create bookmarkable and shareable
states without relying on complex client-side libraries. The pattern
involves the server reading URL parameters, rendering views with
embedded state, and using forms with `hx-push-url` to automatically
synchronize the URL with user interactions.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ENOUGH AI COPILOTS! WE NEED AI HUDS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The prevalent "AI copilot" model is old. Instead, design "AI HUDs"
like the Head-Up Display in airplanes or spellcheck. These focus on
human awareness and understanding through subtle, integrated
information, offering new senses and insights. 

 ON THE EDGE OF COMPETENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The importance of understanding and expanding one's "circle of
competence" is necessary for becoming a better engineer. The circle
itself represents fluency in a particular domain, and maintaining a
sharp circle happens through continuous learning, revisiting
fundamentals, tracking decisions, and seeking feedback. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING STUDY MODE (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI introduced "study mode" in ChatGPT, a new learning experience
to guide users through problems step-by-step rather than providing
immediate answers. This feature uses custom system instructions to
encourage active participation, manage cognitive load, and promote
self-reflection. 

 GLASS3D GENERATOR (WEBSITE) [14] 

 A simple code generator for creating 3D glass effects using CSS. 

 VISUAL CSS (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Visual CSS is an AI-powered styling tool that allows for real-time
visual editing of any website's CSS.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A FULL CODE AGENT IN 200 LINES—HERE'S HOW (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A minimal code agent, dubbed "nano-claude-code" in this article, can
be built in just 200 lines of code using JavaScript and Bun. The agent
uses tools like reading and writing files and executing bash commands
to interact with the local filesystem. The core of the agent is a
while loop that interacts with a large language model to plan and
execute coding tasks based on user prompts and tool availability. 

 THE MAKING OF DARIO AMODEI (33 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Dario Amodei is the CEO of Anthropic. His commitment stems from the
loss of his father, who died from an illness that became curable
shortly after his death, which fuels his desire to accelerate
technological progress. He founded Anthropic after leaving OpenAI with
the goal of developing leading large language models with a strong
emphasis on safety and ethical practices.

QUICK LINKS

 A PERIODIC TABLE OF SYSTEM DESIGN PRINCIPLES (21 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A "periodic table" of recurring system design principles from various
domains in computer systems, with the aim of creating a shared
vocabulary for reasoning about structure, trade-offs, and design
choices. 

 WHEN JAVASCRIPT DECIDED MY DAY STARTS AT 9AM (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A bug caused by JavaScript's `new Date('YYYY-MM-DD')` constructor
interprets the date as midnight UTC, leading to unexpected filtering
behavior in a Japanese admin dashboard where data before 9 AM was
excluded due to the UTC+9 timezone. 

 SIMPLE LIVE RELOAD FOR DEVELOPING STATIC SITES (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 A 39-line client-side JavaScript snippet can automatically reload a
static website in the browser whenever changes are detected in the
source files, using HTTP HEAD requests to monitor Last-Modified and
ETag headers. 

 MEASURING ENGINEERING (6 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Instead of focusing on individual developer metrics like cycle time,
improving software delivery velocity requires a systems-level approach
that considers team trends, system improvements, and the inherent
variability of software development.
