 IDEA ‚è© PRODUCTION: USING VISUAL DEVELOPMENT AND AI TO SHIP 10X
FASTER (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Does shipping digital experiences quickly mean compromising on
quality? Not necessarily. AI and visual development create new ways to
build, iterate upon, and optimize applications and websites.

This live session will cut through the hype [4] and provide a
realistic view of how traditional CMS architecture misses the mark and
how emerging technologies address long-standing challenges:

> How visual development + AI [4] can dramatically accelerate your
workflow

> The power of Generative UI and Structured UI [4] in modern web
development

> Real-world examples [4] of organizations shipping digital
experiences 10x faster

 TECHNICAL DETAILS: FALCON CONTENT UPDATE FOR WINDOWS HOSTS (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 On July 19, CrowdStrike released a sensor configuration update to
Windows systems that triggered a logic error resulting in system
crashes and blue screens. The issue was caused by an updated Channel
File 291 (a config file) that controls how Falcon evaluates named pipe
execution. CrowdStrike has corrected the error and updated the file,
but billions of systems are still affected. 

 HOW NOT TO USE BOX SHADOWS (27 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Box shadows in CSS can be used to create a variety of effects beyond
simple drop shadows, such as layered shadows, rounded corners, and
3D-like effects. They can be combined and animated to create complex
visuals, such as bouncing balls and simulated 3D objects. This article
goes over how to and how not to use box shadows. Using box shadows for
such advanced effects can be performance-intensive, especially when
blurring or transparency is involved. 

 WHY IS SPAWNING A NEW PROCESS IN NODE SO SLOW? (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Node's spawn function can be slow due to its blocking nature. Using
the Node cluster module or worker threads can improve spawn
performance, but may have drawbacks like isolated processes or added
overhead. Moving spawn calls to child processes and using abstract
sockets or process.send for communication can help performance in this
case.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DON'T OVERPLAN, DO PROTOTYPE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Overplanning in software projects can lead to overcomplication,
overengineering, and wasted time. Prototyping is better because it
helps identify unknown challenges and bottlenecks. It's better to
build a minimum viable product (MVP) and iterate based on real-world
feedback than to strive for perfection on paper. 

 LET'S BLAME THE DEV WHO PRESSED "DEPLOY" (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This author disagrees with blaming software engineers for the
CrowdStrike outage, instead placing responsibility on CEOs, customers,
government regulations, middle management, and the board of directors.
These parties prioritized profits over quality and failed to give the
software engineers the respect and resources they needed to do their
jobs properly. 

 HAVE YOU GONE FROM BEING A TECH LEAD TO A SENIOR AGAIN? (REDDIT
THREAD) [10] 

 Reddit users share their positive experiences transitioning from tech
lead back to senior engineer roles. The transition improved work-life
balance and a renewed focus on technical skills for many.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 üëâ GET 80% AUTOMATED E2E TEST COVERAGE BY OCTOBER (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Over 2/3rd of dev teams test less than 50% of their workflows,
causing bugs to sneak out. QA Wolf [11] gets your organization to 80%
automated E2E test coverage in less than 4 months.

They create and maintain your test suite in open-source Playwright.
Plus, they provide unlimited parallel test runs [11] on their
infrastructure (24-hour maintenance included).

The results? With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [12] achieved
4x more test cases and 86% faster QA cycles.

 DATA FOR A.I. TRAINING IS DISAPPEARING FAST, STUDY SHOWS (7 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 A recent study by the Data Provenance Initiative found a significant
decrease in the availability of web data for training AI models. This
is due to many websites restricting data usage through methods like
the Robots Exclusion Protocol or changing their terms of service. This
data scarcity will be tough for AI companies who rely on large
datasets to train and improve their models. 

 RUNNING UNTRUSTED JAVASCRIPT CODE (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Running untrusted JavaScript code within an application can open up a
world of customization but also exposes the platform to security
risks. There are various methods to mitigate these risks, including
time-boxing execution with Web Workers, disallowing global objects,
and using isolated virtual machines. Developers can also opt for
server-side options like Docker or WebAssembly. 

 INTEL VS. SAMSUNG VS. TSMC (18 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Leading foundries Intel, Samsung, and TSMC are differentiating
themselves with unique approaches to 3D chip design and packaging.
Intel focuses on developing "sockets" for chiplets, Samsung is
creating mini-consortia of chiplet providers, and TSMC offers a
variety of packaging options and a new design language called 3Dblox.
These foundries are also working on new technologies like custom HBM,
backside power delivery, and glass substrates to address challenges in
performance, power delivery, and signal integrity.

 DELUGE OF FAKE MAC APP STORE REVIEWS (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 There are a large number of fake reviews on the Mac App Store for
cheap top paid apps, all of which were posted around the same time
period, that may have been purchased by a single developer to
camouflage their own app's fake reviews.
