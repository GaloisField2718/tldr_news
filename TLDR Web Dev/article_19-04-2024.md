ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY SQLITE PERFORMANCE TUNING MADE BENCHER 1200X FASTER (15 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A developer found that a webpage that was used for performance
tracking was really slow. They discovered that inefficient SQL queries
were causing long delays. By understanding the SQLite query planner,
the developer added indexes and a materialized view to improve the
database query performance and thereby speed up the page load time. 

 THE ART OF SVG FILTERS AND WHY IT IS AWESOME (18 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SVG filters are a way to apply image-like effects (blur, color
shifts, distortion, etc.) to web vector graphics and even HTML
elements. They can be used to add effects to text on the web,
including borders, bevels, textures, and more. This article shows how
through code examples.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT WAS THE MOST GENIUS HACK YOU DID IN WEBDEV? (REDDIT THREAD) [7] 

 Developers share their web dev ‚Äúhacks‚Äù and stories. One developer
improved a slow SQL scheduling algorithm by refactoring the code and
converting sub-selects to joins. Others found creative ways to work
around limitations in older web tech, like using system commands for a
school prank or inventing a precursor to AJAX for a chat application. 

 WHY YOU NEED A "WTF NOTEBOOK" (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A ‚ÄúWTF Notebook‚Äù is used to write down observed issues you may
encounter while working. After a few weeks, you'll have a list of
problems that will resonate with teammates and now you can present
solutions to the team for those problems. This lets you take ownership
and initiative within the team, allowing you to make changes and show
impact effectively. 

 MOST MICROMANAGERS ARE BLIND TO BEING SEEN AS ONE (4 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Micromanagement, even when stemming from good intentions, can be
hurtful to team productivity and morale. Great managers tailor their
communication style for each employee individually, based on their
personality and the work they're doing. Micromanagers check in
constantly and try to help unsolicitedly.

MISCELLANEOUS

 I ACCIDENTALLY BUILT A MEME SEARCH ENGINE (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This developer built a meme search engine as a way to learn about
vector embeddings and image encoding. They used OpenAI's CLIP model to
encode images into vector embeddings, which are a way to represent
images or text as numerical vectors, for similarity searches. These
embeddings were stored in a vector database, which then made memes
searchable with just natural language. 

 VULNERABILITIES FOR AI AND ML APPLICATIONS ARE SKYROCKETING (4 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 The number of vulnerabilities in AI and ML applications is increasing

popular open-source projects, which is a 220% increase since November
2023.
