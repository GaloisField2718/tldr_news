ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO REFACTOR CODE WITH GITHUB COPILOT (17 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 GitHub Copilot can help with code refactoring by explaining code,
suggesting improvements, and performing restructuring tasks. This post
shows a real-world example of how to use Copilot to refactor code for
a large-scale migration system. The process involves creating common
modules, adding new classes, encapsulating state, and iteratively
refining the codebase with Copilot's assistance. 

 BUILDING AND OPERATING A PRETTY BIG STORAGE SYSTEM CALLED S3 (19
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article goes over how S3 works, the steps taken to build it, and
how it runs today. One of the people involved in building it talks
about the personal, technical, and organizational challenges he faced
along the way. One of the greatest learnings and career accelerators
was ownership and encouraging ownership in others. There are often
multiple ways to solve a problem, and picking the right one is letting
someone own the solution.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BACKEND DEVELOPER: CURRENT INDUSTRY EXPECTATIONS AND GROWTH
OPPORTUNITIES (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Current industry expectations for backend developers include having
the skills to design scalable services, write clean code, and
understand data structures. Job posting languages are usually for
Java, Python, NodeJS, and Go, with some requiring additional framework
and tool knowledge. There are also specialized competencies such as
multithreading, distributed systems, and cloud expertise which are all
in high demand. 

 OPEN-SOURCE IS WHERE DREAMS GO TO DIE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The open-source model is broken, leading to burnout for developers
who are overwhelmed by the demands of entitled users and the lack of
financial support. Open-source projects often start as labors of love
but transform into unpaid technical support roles. Companies should
increase their level of sponsorship for open-source packages they use
often. 

 ARE HACKATHONS AN ANTIPATTERN? (REDDIT THREAD) [8] 

 Company hackathons are an antipattern. Developers often need to
"catch up" after the hackathon, which makes its benefits questionable.
Many commenters agree that hackathons often become unpaid labor or are
used to extract free ideas.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NEXT.JS 15.2 (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Next.js 15.2 introduces a redesigned error debugging experience with
improved UI and stack traces. The update also implements streaming
metadata, allowing for faster initial UI rendering by decoupling it
from metadata generation. Turbopack performance has been improved with
faster compile times and reduced memory usage. Experimental support
has been added for React View Transitions and Node.js Middleware. 

 TACH (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Tach is a Python tool, written in Rust, designed to enforce
dependencies and interfaces in Python projects. It makes sure imports
come from declared dependencies, cross-module calls use public
interfaces, and prevents dependency cycles.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MEET THE JOURNALISTS TRAINING AI MODELS FOR META AND OPENAI (9 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Journalists are being recruited by companies like Outlier, owned by
Scale AI, to train LLMs for tech giants like Meta and OpenAI. These
platforms offer remote, flexible gig work where journalists use their
writing, research, and fact-checking skills to improve AI model
accuracy. Some journalists see this trend as contributing to the
obsolescence of their profession, while others view it as a way to
gain knowledge about AI and adapt to the changing world. 

 THE JOB MARKET IS FROZEN (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The job market is experiencing a "Big Freeze," with hiring slowing a
lot and workers less likely to quit. This unusual situation is unseen
by economists and comes from employers' anxieties after the Great
Resignation and uncertainties about the economy and political
landscape. This freeze disproportionately affects young professionals,
adding blockers to their career advancement and wage growth. 

 COMPARING LOCAL LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS FOR ALT-TEXT GENERATION (14
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 12 AI models, including 10 local and 2 cloud-based, were tested to
generate alt-text for 10,000 images on this developer's blog, where
9,000 lack descriptions. Cloud models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5
performed best, while local models such as LLaVA and MiniCPM-V showed
okay but less accurate results.

 SHOW HN: I GOT LAID OFF FROM META AND CREATED A MINOR HIT ON STEAM
(HACKER NEWS THREAD) [14] 

 A former Meta employee who was laid off in spring 2023 created a
roguelike pachinko/plinko game called Ballionaire, launched it on
Steam in December 2024 after working on it intensely throughout the
year, and has already sold ~200,000 units. 

 SECURING TOMORROW'S SOFTWARE: THE NEED FOR MEMORY SAFETY STANDARDS (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 To address the growing problem of memory safety vulnerabilities,
these Google engineers advocate for industry-wide standardization of
memory safety practices. 

 LIMITATIONS VS. CAPABILITIES (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Deno's initial HTTP import limitations, while now seen as drawbacks
compared to npm specifiers, were actually beneficial features that
encouraged simplicity, security, and a web-like approach to
development. 

 MINECRAFT: LCE DECOMPILATION PROJECT (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This is a work-in-progress decompilation project for Minecraft:
Legacy Console Edition (Nintendo Switch v1.0.17), which recreates the
game's source code by using symbols from the Wii U Edition and the
Switch Edition's typeinfo.
