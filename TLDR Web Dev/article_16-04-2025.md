ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 JSX OVER THE WIRE (59 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 An alternative approach to traditional REST APIs is having APIs
return UI components as JSON using React Server Components (RSC). By
composing ViewModels, the code generating props is directly linked
with the code consuming those props. This ends up with self-contained
UI pieces that handle their data dependencies, are rendered in a
single client-server roundtrip, and maintain client-side state. 

 HOW I REDUCED MY REACT BUNDLE SIZE BY 30% (WITH REAL EXAMPLES) (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Reducing React bundle sizes leads to faster load times and a better
user experience. There are a few practical tips to do this, including
removing side effects, deleting unused code, avoiding barrel files,
and using lighter libraries. Applying multiple of these strategies
allowed this developer to reduce his app's bundle size by over 30%. 

 A FLOWING WEBGL GRADIENT, DECONSTRUCTED (47 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A flowing WebGL gradient effect is a great tutorial for teaching
basic shader concepts while creating the final product. This post goes
over how to write shaders, color mapping, gradient noise, and use
WebGL to improve performance. It also goes over creative rendering
techniques, like creating animated waves using stacked sine waves and
simplex noise, implementing dynamic blur, and using gradient textures
for more flexible color mapping.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE SYSTEMIC FAILURE OF IMPLEMENTING CSS PRINCIPLES (8 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Modern approaches to CSS architecture fail to uphold the principle of
separating structure (HTML) from presentation (CSS). Utility classes
in frameworks like Bootstrap lead to verbose HTML with styling
information embedded within it, making the code harder to both read
and maintain. 

 THIS IS WHY YOU'RE NOT SHIPPING (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many companies unknowingly slow themselves down with excessive
meetings, rigid team structures, and unnecessary approval processes.
PostHog avoids these traps by having transparency, giving engineers
the power to make final decisions, and maintaining a flexible team
structure. 

 HOW TO BE THE BEST PROGRAMMER, ACCORDING TO DANIEL TERHORST-NORTH (9
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The best programmers are not necessarily algorithm experts but
deliver results and have a lot of curiosity. They prioritize building
a product for the user, choose the right tools for the job regardless
of prior experience, and write simple, easily adaptable code.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SCALAR (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Scalar is an open-source API platform with a modern REST API client,
API references, and first-class OpenAPI/Swagger support. 

 TIPTAP UI COMPONENTS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Tiptap UI Components is a library of React components, templates, and
primitives for building rich text editors easily on top of the Tiptap
editor framework. 

 FUMADOCS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 FumaDocs is a documentation framework built on Next.js that uses
TypeScript, MDX, and Tailwind CSS. It provides utilities, a UI, and
features of Next.js App Router. FumaDocs includes built-in components
and integrations, focusing on a user-friendly mobile responsive
experience.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE CASE OF THE UI THREAD THAT HUNG IN A KERNEL CALL (9 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 A customer's UI thread was hanging due to a deadlock involving a
watchdog thread. The watchdog thread was suspending the UI thread to
capture a stack trace, but the UI thread held a lock needed by the
watchdog to complete the stack capture, resulting in a deadlock. To
avoid this, thread suspension for debugging should be done from a
separate process. 

 HACKING THE POSTGRES WIRE PROTOCOL (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 PgDog is a network proxy that understands the Postgres wire protocol,
allowing it to route queries to multiple databases without application
code changes. It parses SQL queries using a Rust library extracted
from Postgres itself to identify sharding keys and determine where to
send the query. It also manages cross-shard queries by handling and
manipulating messages to combine results from multiple shards,
including rewriting row counts and managing data types.
