ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DATABASE TYPES EXPLAINED SIMPLY (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article discusses multiple types of databases, such as
relational (SQL), NoSQL, NewSQL, and vector databases. It explains the
key features, use cases, and downsides of each type. Relational
databases store structured data, ensuring data integrity but can be
complex and expensive. NoSQL databases handle unstructured data and
offer flexibility but may lack data consistency. NewSQL databases
combine scalability and ACID compliance for high-transaction systems.
Vector databases are specialized for usage in machine learning. 

 THE ANATOMY OF SHADCN/UI (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Shadcn/ui is a JavaScript UI library that provides components through
a CLI that inserts their source code directly into your project
instead of relying on npm packages. Shadcn/ui's architecture separates
components into two layers: structure and behavior, and style. It
follows principles like the Single Responsibility Principle and
Dependency Inversion Principle and offers utility functions for
managing class names to ensure consistent and reusable components. It
empowers web developers to build their own design systems with
customizable defaults.
