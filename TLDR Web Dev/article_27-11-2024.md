While there’s often a lack of incentive to make significant
performance improvements, there are many cases where there’s

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT PERFORMANCE: HOW I MADE
THINGS FASTER IN MY PAJAMAS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A software engineer, working independently, was able to make huge
performance improvements in various apps, including a 30% faster Uber
app startup, a 3x speed increase in Android UI display, and an 11%
speedup in Lucene. These optimizations were accomplished through the
use of automated tools and techniques that focused on identifying and
resolving inefficiencies in code, such as overly broad synchronization
blocks and dynamic method dispatches. While there's often a lack of
incentive to make significant performance improvements, there are many
cases where there's low-hanging fruit. 

 FEATURE-BASED REACT ARCHITECTURE (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Using a feature-based architecture in React apps can make them easier
to maintain and scale. This article goes over how to decouple
components and data fetching functions. Focusing each on a single
feature avoids intertwining vertical features and creating overly
complex functions. This approach initially leads to multiple data
requests but can be later optimized using `Promise.all` for parallel
fetching to improve performance. 

 WHAT I WISH SOMEONE TOLD ME ABOUT POSTGRES (22 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This is a collection of tips and advice for working with Postgres
databases. It covers how to improve psql usage, optimize queries, and
understand the impact of locks and JSONB on application performance.
It is important to normalize data and follow the recommendations of
the Postgres developers.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I DIDN'T NEED KUBERNETES, AND YOU PROBABLY DON'T EITHER (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 This developer found that Google Cloud Run's pay-per-use model, fast
scaling, and lack of cluster management overhead made it a better
choice cost-wise compared to Kubernetes. Despite some minor workflow
inconveniences in Cloud Run, the overall experience was better. 

 I HAVE 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND STILL NEED A MENTOR. YOU DO TOO (9
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mentorship should be a continuous process and not just for
onboarding. Even people with lots of experience can benefit from
mentoring because there is always knowledge to transfer and things to
learn from others' experiences. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 JEKYLL SQLITE (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 The Jekyll-SQLite plugin allows Jekyll users to use SQLite databases
as data sources for their websites. It supports site-level, per-page,
and prepared queries, which can use existing data as parameters. 

 JSONTR.EE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 jsontr.ee is a lightweight JavaScript library that visualizes JSON
data as interactive, dynamically-positioned tree diagrams using SVG.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BUILDING LLMS IS PROBABLY NOT GOING BE A BRILLIANT BUSINESS (11
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 LLMs are likely to be an unprofitable business, just like airlines,
an industry with historically poor profitability. This is due to an
unfavorable industry structure for LLM makers, characterized by a
powerful single supplier (Nvidia), high buyer fickleness, numerous
competitors, and easy market entry for new players. 

 WHICH IDES DO SOFTWARE ENGINEERS LOVE, AND WHY? (17 MINUTE READ) [12]


 A recent survey of software engineers shows a shift in IDE
preferences, with newer AI-first options like Cursor and Windsurf
gaining popularity. Key features driving this popularity include
improved code generation, faster performance, multi-file editing,
agentic capabilities, and intuitive interfaces.

QUICK LINKS

 ARCHETYPES OF LLM APPS (24 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 There are three levels of LLM application within businesses:
foundational building blocks (chat, embeddings, and semantic search),
basic applications (code generation, summarization, and analysis), and
advanced applications (RAG, agents, and swarms). 

 1 BILLION NESTED LOOP ITERATIONS (WEBSITE) [14] 

 A benchmark of one billion nested loop iterations across various
programming languages revealed that C/clang and Rust were the fastest
(0.50 seconds), while Python and R were the slowest (over 70 seconds).


 HOW FAST DOES JAVA COMPILE? (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Java compiler is extremely fast, but build tools add a lot of
overhead.
