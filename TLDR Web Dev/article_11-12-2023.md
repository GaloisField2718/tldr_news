 IS YOUR ALERTING BILL OUT OF CONTROL? (SPONSOR) [6] 

 Alerting as a standalone tool can be mad pricey and those old-school
legacy brands just can't keep up with how software is built today. But
with Signals, we're merging alerting and incident management into one
slick platform, tailor-made to revolutionize how modern engineering
teams handle alerts.

 EXAMPLES OF GREAT URL DESIGN (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Thoughtful URL design strikes a balance between the needs of
computers and humans. For example, StackOverflow‚Äôs URLs combine a
unique identifier and a human-readable slug, so both computers and
humans can understand a URL without having to visit it. Slack
incorporates natural language sentences into URLs. GitHub and NPM map
well to their respective domain semantics, making navigation
efficient. 

 DOES INTERACTION TO NEXT PAINT ACTUALLY CORRELATE TO USER BEHAVIOR?
(5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Earlier this year, Google announced that INP (Interaction to Next
Paint) is going out of experimental mode and will replace First Input
Delay (FID) as a Core Web Vital in April 2024. This post takes real
world data to attempt to correlate INP with real user behavior and
business metrics. The short conclusion is that as INP gets worse,
business metrics, like conversion rates for sales, tend to suffer. 

 A DEEP DIVE INTO CPU REQUESTS AND LIMITS IN KUBERNETES (16 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This article explores the effects of CPU requests and limits in
Kubernetes and the differences between the default CPU Manager policy
and the static policy. To demonstrate these concepts, the article uses
scenarios where setting CPU limits is advisable, such as benchmarking,
multi-tenant environments, predictability, and Quality of Service
(QoS) guarantees. It delves into the details of the CPU Manager's
static policy, including how it assigns CPU cores to containers and
the associated metrics to monitor.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOU ARE NEVER TAUGHT HOW TO BUILD QUALITY SOFTWARE (7 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 It‚Äôs common for software projects to lack adequate quality
assurance measures, leading to last-minute QA sprints and unreliable
software releases. Budget constraints frequently lead companies to cut
QA efforts, resulting in rushed and error-prone releases. In order to
convince management of the importance of QA, it‚Äôs important to frame
it in terms of cost savings and efficiency gains and start with a
minimal effective dose of QA measures. 

 WHAT I WISH I KNEW AS A MID-LEVEL ENGINEER (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Shortly after being promoted to mid-level engineer, this author made
a subtle mistake by focusing on tasks that, while technically
impressive, didn't align with the company's priorities for
senior-level engineers. He received an "exceeds expectations" rating
but didn‚Äôt make progress towards a promotion. To progress from
mid-level to senior, it's crucial to consider the "why" behind your
work and ensure it aligns with what's most important to your personal
interests, team, and company all at once. 

 BECOMING A GO-TO PERSON GETS YOU PROMOTED. HERE'S HOW TO DO IT AS A
SOFTWARE ENGINEER (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 One effective strategy to reach the senior level as an engineer is to
become an expert in a specific area, whether it's a technical skill or
a product domain. To determine your expertise, consider what aligns
with team or company impact, what you're good at, and what you're
passionate about. To become known as an expert, focus on being visible
and adding value, such as giving presentations, leading projects,
solving challenging problems, and actively contributing to your team's
success.

 HOW OFTEN SHOULD WE SHARPEN OUR TOOLS? (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Tool sharpening refers to the process of improving or upgrading the
tools and software one uses for work. This author shares a personal
experience of transitioning from one text editor (NEdit) to another
(Vim) and later to Neovim, highlighting the considerations,
challenges, and benefits of such transitions. As engineers, there is a
cost of time and effort in adopting new tools. At the same time,
it‚Äôs important to periodically reevaluate tool choices and
configurations to ensure they enable one to be as productive as
possible. 

 AN INTUITIVE DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Good documentation enables smoother project handovers, reduces
dependencies on core team members, and simplifies onboarding for new
team members. This is a playbook for creating intuitive documentation,
including the importance of creating a simple manifesto or vision,
establishing an intuitive folder structure, and automating
documentation creation where it adds value. It includes practical
examples and templates for organizing documentation, covering topics
like architecture, onboarding guides, and specialist path guides.
