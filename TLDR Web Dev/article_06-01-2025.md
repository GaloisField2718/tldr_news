There are two developer types: "bootstrappers," who use AI for rapid
prototyping, and "iterators," who use AI in daily
workflows. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING A POLITE & FAST WEB CRAWLER (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A Mozilla engineer noticed that poorly-behaved bots, primarily from
OpenAI and Amazon, caused 70% of the load on Diapsora's servers (an
open-source social network). To address this, he built a “polite and
fast” web crawler using Python and gevent, prioritizing respectful
rate limiting by defaulting to one request per domain every five
seconds and dynamically adjusting based on server responses. The
crawler efficiently manages the queue by fetching robots.txt files in
parallel and uses a sophisticated refetching strategy using HTTP
headers to minimize redundant requests. 

 YOU DON'T NEED NEXT.JS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ComfyDeploy migrated its dashboard from Next.js to a plain React
setup, which improved build times (from 3 minutes to 18 seconds) and
hot reload speed (under 200ms). This decision was driven by escalating
Vercel costs, testing difficulties with Next.js's server actions, and
painfully slow local development. The migration incorporated TanStack
Router and Rspack, forcing architectural improvements and cleaner
code. 

 BACK TO BASICS: WHY WE CHOSE LONG POLLING OVER WEBSOCKETS (10 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Inferable chose HTTP long polling over WebSockets for its real-time
system due to scalability challenges with its Node.js/TypeScript
backend and PostgreSQL database. Long polling, unlike short polling or
WebSockets, keeps the connection open until data is available or a
timeout is reached, offering a balance between immediacy and resource
efficiency. This approach avoided complexities associated with
WebSockets, such as adapting its observability stack, authentication
mechanisms, and infrastructure configurations.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW AI-ASSISTED CODING WILL CHANGE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING: HARD TRUTHS
(25 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There are two developer types: "bootstrappers," who use AI for rapid
prototyping, and "iterators," who use AI in daily workflows. While AI
accelerates development a lot, it introduces challenges like the "70%
problem," where achieving the final 30% of software quality requires
real human expertise. As a result, AI makes the lives of experienced
software engineers easier, but doesn't replace them. 

 REFLECTIONS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sam Altman reflects on OpenAI's journey, the unexpected success of
ChatGPT's launch, and the subsequent rapid growth. It was challenging
and messy to build a company around groundbreaking technology, as
shown by his own public firing and subsequent reinstatement. He's
learned a lot and will be more confident moving forward.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CKEDITOR: A VERSATILE RICH TEXT EDITOR THAT'S COMPATIBLE WITH ANY
JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORK (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Need to add WYSIWYG HTML editing to an app or a website? CKEditor is
a modern, feature-rich JavaScript editor that's infinitely
customizable [9] (frontend + backend) to build exactly what you need.
It's production-ready, comes with a sleek and collaborative UX, and
works with your tech - TypeScript, React, Vue.js, and more. Start for
free [9] 

 LOGLAYER (WEBSITE) [10] 

 LogLayer is a JavaScript logging library that provides a consistent
logging experience across different logging providers. It offers a
flexible API for adding tags, metadata, and errors to log messages,
supporting multiple loggers simultaneously (e.g., DataDog and New
Relic). 

 TAILWIND CSS MOTION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 A Tailwind CSS plugin that lets you animate any element with inline
styles. It also comes with a Chrome extension to let you play with
animating your website directly. 

 CSS FLEXBOX PLAYGROUND (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Experiment with different flex properties to understand how they
affect layout. CSS code is generated in real time and controls are
available for finetuned adjustments.

MISCELLANEOUS

 YOU WOULDN'T DOWNLOAD AN AI (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This developer extracted an AI model from Microsoft's Seeing AI app.
The app's model was found encrypted within the APK file as a
TensorFlow Lite model. It was then verified using Netron, which led to
the successful extraction of the AI model's weights and biases. 

 CAN LLMS WRITE BETTER CODE IF YOU KEEP ASKING THEM TO “WRITE BETTER
CODE”? (22 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 An LLM was told to "write better code," which led to performance
improvements in a Python program through multiple iterations. However,
the improvements eventually plateaued, and the code became
over-engineered. A second experiment used more precise prompt
engineering, explicitly outlining optimization goals, which eventually
led to a 100x speedup.

QUICK LINKS

 THANK YOU (2024 EDITION) (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The CSS-Tricks website returned to consistent publishing in 2024,
leading to 26 million unique pageviews, many significant site updates
and content additions, and new goals. 

 WORLD'S FIRST MIDI SHELLCODE (45 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This author gained remote code execution on a Yamaha PSR-E433
synthesizer via its MIDI interface by reverse engineering its
firmware. 

 PRINTF DEBUGGING IS OK (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Devs should take a pragmatic approach to debugging, and all
techniques are valid (including just using printf) for efficiently
finding and fixing bugs. 

 THE RECOIL REPOSITORY HAS BEEN ARCHIVED ON JAN 1, 2025. YOU HAD A
GOOD RUN (REDDIT THREAD) [18] 

 After both maintainers of Recoil, a React state management library
created by Meta, were laid off, the repository was officially archived
as no Meta engineers were willing to take up the work of maintaining
it.
