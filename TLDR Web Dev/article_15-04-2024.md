ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW ONE LINE OF CODE CAUSED A $60 MILLION LOSS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In 1990, half of AT&T's phone network went down as a result of one
line of C code that contained a buggy implementation of call handling.
The outage affected over a hundred thousand Americans and the company
lost $60 million. This article goes over the buggy piece of code that
was deployed by AT&T and how engineers fixed it. 

 USETRANSITION ‚Äì REACT (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new official React doc that explains how to animate a progress
element using the new useTransition hook, which lets you update state
without blocking UI. 

 YOUR BACKGROUND IMAGES MIGHT BE CAUSING CLS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) measures webpage instability caused by
unexpected movements of elements. Background images can make CLS
worse, since CLS calculations consider all page elements. To make sure
that CLS isn't affected negatively by background images, developers
should include width and height attributes on images and iframes.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE PROBLEM WITH TRYING TO SELL DEVELOPER TOOLING IS THAT DEVELOPERS
HAVE NO PURCHASING AUTHORITY (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Selling developer tools is challenging because developers typically
lack the authority to make purchasing decisions. Successful tech
companies often bypass IT and target revenue-generating business
units. Simply making a tool popular doesn't guarantee profitability,
especially with open-source software. 

 TEN YEARS AND COUNTING: MY AFFAIR WITH MICROSERVICES (26 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Allegro, a major e-commerce platform, successfully transformed its
monolithic application into a microservices architecture. Along the
way, it shifted away from physical servers to a cloud-based
infrastructure, which led to a much better developer experience. It
also made large investments in tooling and infrastructure to reduce
manual work for its engineers. Allegro made sure to allow room for
experimentation, but also kept teams accountable for their
architectural decisions. 

 WHY I LOST FAITH IN KAGI (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Paid search engine Kagi has spread itself too thin with multiple
niche projects. The product is also starting to become over-reliant on
AI, which leads to inaccuracy and bias that goes against what Kagi was
in the beginning.

 THE GUIDE TO STOCK OPTIONS CONVERSATIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Employees at startups should learn to understand their stock options
as they are not an intuitive thing to understand. This article goes
over the basics of stock options and how employees should gauge
potential upside (or downside). Engineering managers should make sure
that employees get additional stock option grants as they grow within
the company. 

 HOW I GOT INTO DEEP LEARNING (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This author decided to learn deep learning after running an education
company for 8 years. They focused on the fundamentals with resources
like "The Deep Learning Book", taught as they learned, and implemented
foundational papers. They eventually developed their own tools in the
data extraction space, which led to a job offer from a research lab. 

 LESSONS AFTER A HALF-BILLION GPT TOKENS (10 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This author, who works at a startup with several LLM-powered
features, shares useful insights from using GPT. For text analysis and
extraction, vague prompts often outperform overly specific
instructions. The chat API itself is usually enough for most needs and
most people won't need to use more complex tech like vector databases
or Langchain. For a better user experience, it was useful to mimic the
variable typing speed of chatbots.

software. 

 THE ARC PRODUCT-MARKET FIT FRAMEWORK (12 MINUTE READ) [24]
