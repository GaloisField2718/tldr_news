 TRUST YOUR DEVELOPERS, VERIFY YOUR AI-GENERATED CODE WITH SONAR
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 It's important to ensure that the code generated by LLMs goes through
proper quality checks before going into production. Sonar's code
assurance workflow [4] ensures that AI-generated code meets the
highest standards to produce software that is secure, reliable,
maintainable, and of unparalleled quality. Using Sonar, development
teams can:

 	* Minimize risk in AI code generation
 	* Detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and quality issues in all code
 	* Derive more value from code created by both AI and humans
 	* Boost productivity with AI-generated code fixes

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 GOOD RETRY, BAD RETRY: AN INCIDENT STORY (21 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article explores various techniques for managing retries,
including retry budgets and circuit breakers, and analyzes their
effectiveness through simulations. A developer learned about the
pitfalls of implementing retries in a microservice architecture. He
started by adding retries to solve a transient error issue but
discovered the potential for retry storms and client synchronization
problems. After implementing exponential backoff and jitter, he faced
a new challenge when the system experienced an hour-long outage caused
by a bug in a new feature. 

 HOW DO HTTP SERVERS FIGURE OUT CONTENT-LENGTH? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 HTTP servers determine the "Content-Length" header, which indicates
the size of the response body in two ways. When the response is small
enough to fit in a server buffer, the length is calculated and sent
directly. For larger responses, HTTP employs "chunked transfer
encoding", dividing the data into chunks with their respective
lengths. 

 RUNNING CLANG IN THE BROWSER USING WEBASSEMBLY (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Clang, a compiler front end for C/C++, can now be run directly within
a web browser. This is done using the Wasmer JS SDK, which allows
compiling C code to WebAssembly. This development opens up
possibilities for online IDEs to adopt the SDK and enable users to
compile and run C programs within their browsers.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE FRONTEND TREADMILL (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Frontend teams are wasting time and resources by constantly chasing
the latest frameworks, which are usually destined to become obsolete.
Instead, they should focus on mastering core web technologies and
building deep expertise in their current frameworks. This approach
offers greater career longevity and allows teams to hire skilled
engineers who are adaptable to changing technologies. 

 WEB COMPONENTS ARE NOT FRAMEWORK COMPONENTS ‚Äî AND THAT'S OKAY (10
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Web Components are not meant to replace frameworks but rather to
complement them. There are two ways to think about components:
generalizable elements that extend HTML (where Web Components excel)
and project-specific reactive templating components (where frameworks
still hold an advantage). The Web Components community should focus on
making them more ergonomic for authors, which would make them more
viable as a compile target for frameworks. 

 REACT ON THE SERVER IS NOT PHP (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Server-side JavaScript, specifically using React on the server, is
not a return to PHP. While the concept of server-side rendering may
seem similar to the old PHP approach, the underlying principles and
tools have evolved drastically to offer unified stacks rather than
having separate stacks for frontend and backend.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ‚úÇÔ∏è CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES (SPONSOR) [11] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it ‚Äî you need to check out QA
Wolf.

QA Wolf's [12] AI-native approach gets engineering teams to 80%
automated end-to-end test coverage [12] and helps them ship 5x faster
by reducing QA cycles from hours to minutes.

The result? With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [13] achieved
4x more test cases and 86% faster QA cycles.

 PYTHON 3.13 (WEBSITE) [14] 

 Python 3.13 has been released. It includes a new interactive
interpreter, experimental support for free-threaded execution, and a
Just-In-Time compiler. The release also features enhanced error
messages with color highlighting, improved locals() semantics, and
default values for type parameters. 

 SQ (WEBSITE) [15] 

 sq is an open-source data wrangling tool that allows users to
inspect, query, join, import, and export data. It supports a wide
range of data sources including common SQL databases, Excel XLSX
files, CSV, TSV, JSON, JSONA, and JSONL formats. It also provides
various output formats like INSERT to SQL databases, CSV, Markdown,
and more. 

 JAZZ (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Jazz is an open-source toolkit that makes building real-time,
collaborative applications easier by providing a single abstraction
for distributed state, replacing the need for traditional APIs,
databases, and message queues. It uses CRDTs and public-key
cryptography to enable real-time, cross-device synchronization with
secure permissions, built-in conflict resolution, and seamless
integration with various environments, including React, React Native,
and NodeJS.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE USE OF "FOO" AND "BAR" IN SOURCE CODE
EXAMPLES? (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The terms "foo" and "bar" in code examples originated from the WWII
military acronym "FUBAR" (F**ked Up Beyond All Recognition). The
popularity of "foo" and "bar" in code likely stems from their
association with this military jargon. 

 VIRTUALIZING IOS ON APPLE SILICON (16 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A developer successfully virtualized iOS on Apple Silicon Macs
through a combination of kernel patches and system modifications. The
challenges encountered during the process included signature
verification and binary incompatibilities between iOS and macOS. The
developer used undocumented features of Apple's Virtualization
framework and found hints of potential future developments like touch
functionality. 

 OPTIMIZING POSTGRES TABLE LAYOUT FOR MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY (15 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 Postgres adds padding to data for efficient disk access through a
process called ‚Äúdata alignment.‚Äù Misaligned columns can increase
the size of tables and indexes, leading to wasted disk space and
slower performance. This article provides practical examples and code
snippets showing how to optimize table and index layout for better
alignment.

 THE NINE NODE PILLARS (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The Nine Node Pillars are a set of guiding principles for building
maintainable Node.js applications that includes advice like not
blocking the event loop and always using Node LTS versions in
production. 

 DOES IT SCALE (DOWN)? (2 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Developers should prioritize scaling down their software first,
starting small and only scaling up when necessary, as modern hardware
makes it possible to run most applications efficiently on a single
server. 

 6 YEARS WITH GLEAM (4 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Gleam's type system and functional programming approach significantly
increases productivity, especially in fast-growing codebases. 

 HOW TO FETCH DATA IN REACT (13 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 There are various methods for fetching data in React applications,
including server-side fetching with React Server Components,
client-side fetching with React Query, hooks, and tRPC.
