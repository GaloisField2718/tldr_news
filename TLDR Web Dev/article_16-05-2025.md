ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE MADE BILLING BACKENDLESS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Autumn tried to simplify billing by handling payments directly on the
frontend. Its initial approach was to use a "publishable key," but it
was limited and confusing. Next, it experimented with Next.js server
actions, which were insecure due to the exposure of customer IDs. To
address this, it implemented a custom encryption layer for server
actions, which finally allowed secure operations from the frontend. 

 STATIC AS A SERVER (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hybrid frameworks can function as both server-side and static site
generators. These frameworks use the request/response model of server
frameworks, but can be used to pre-render static sites by running the
server during the build process. Hybrid frameworks are more flexible
and reduce tooling fragmentation compared to static-only tools. 

 GITHUB ISSUES SEARCH NOW SUPPORTS NESTED QUERIES AND BOOLEAN
OPERATORS: HERE'S HOW WE (RE)BUILT IT (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GitHub has upgraded its Issues search with support for nested queries
and boolean operators, allowing users to build complex searches with
AND/OR logic across all fields. The technical implementation involved
creating an AST parser and mapping the complex queries to
Elasticsearch's boolean query structure while maintaining backward
compatibility.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I DON'T LIKE NUMPY (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 NumPy is a popular Python library for array computations that
frustratingly makes complex array operations unnecessarily difficult
and unintuitive. NumPy's broadcasting and indexing features are
confusing and error-prone, and its function design is too complex. 

 WORKING ON COMPLEX SYSTEMS: WHAT I LEARNED WORKING AT GOOGLE (13
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Complicated and complex systems are different in that complex systems
require adaptive solutions and novel approaches. There are five
characteristics of complex systems: emergent behavior, delayed
consequences, local vs. global optimization, hysteresis, and
nonlinearity. To navigate complexity, devs should favor reversible
decisions, think beyond immediate metrics, embrace innovation, use
controlled rollouts, and prioritize observability. 

 IS THE FUTURE OF REACT STILL AS BRIGHT IN 2025 AS IT WAS BEFORE?
(REDDIT THREAD) [10] 

 Various opinions on the future of React. Some regard it as a web
standard and the only framework many web devs know, others think the
rendering model is outdated, and many think the tight coupling with
Next.js and Vercel will lead to its downfall.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WHY DIY INTERNAL TOOLS COLLAPSE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Vibe coding tools like Lovable and Bolt promise speed but create tech
debt, security gaps, and shadow IT. As AI demands grow, DIY
foundations fail.

Superblocks gathered insights from top engineering leaders on how
enterprises are shifting to governed, scalable internal tooling. CIOs
and CTOs need a secure, scalable platform [12] with built-in
governance, extensibility, and enterprise-ready AI.

 STACK OVERFLOW IS ALMOST DEAD (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Stack Overflow's question volume has plummeted to 2009 levels. This
decline began around 2014 with increased moderation. It accelerated
after ChatGPT's launch, and was made worse by the rise of LLMs
providing faster and more polite answers. 

 IF AI IS SO GOOD AT CODING … WHERE ARE THE OPEN SOURCE
CONTRIBUTIONS? (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 There's a lack of substantial AI contributions to open-source
projects, where code is transparent and easily verifiable. AI-derived
pull requests cannot yet address complex issues. AI coding tools can
be useful for experienced developers but problematic for novices.
