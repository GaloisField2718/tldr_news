 MITIGATING COMMON AUTHENTICATION RISKS (SPONSOR) [5] 

 A poorly implemented authentication system [5] is a recipe for
disaster. And given the increase in data beaches in the past few
years, it‚Äôs more important than ever for software engineering
leaders to prioritize security, quality development practices, and
robust governance controls.
This article by FusionAuth [5] covers key best practices for
mitigating common risks when implementing authentication ‚Äî including
application security, password hashing, regulatory compliance, costs,
integration, and vendor assessment. Read the full article here

 WHAT IS JWT? (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are an open standard for securely sharing JSON
data between parties through encoding and digital signatures. They are
used for API authentication, data transfer, and authorization
workflows. JWTs consist of three parts: a header, payload, and
signature, and can be used to securely transmit data between various
systems. While JWTs offer benefits like statelessness, efficiency, and
interoperability, they also pose challenges such as security risks,
token size, and limited central control. 

 HOW CANVA IMPLEMENTED END-TO-END TRACING (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Canva has implemented end-to-end distributed tracing for
observability in their systems. They emphasize the Three Pillars of
Observability: logs (timestamped events), metrics (quantifiable
statistics), and traces (representation of request events). With
distributed tracing, they use traces, spans (single operations within
a trace), and tags (metadata key-value pairs) to gain insights into
their system's performance. Canva also developed a custom frontend
tracing SDK for themselves. 

 THE USER EXPERIENCE OF THE FRONTEND CLOUD (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article discusses the importance of speed and personalization in
web applications. Fast loading times are crucial for user engagement
and search engine rankings. The article explains how being on the
edge, caching mechanisms, and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
can help developers create faster web apps.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO MAKE YOUR TEAM READ YOUR MIND (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A "Manager's ReadMe" is a document that outlines expectations for
their reports. It provides insights into the manager's role, how they
do 1:1 meetings, their office and remote work policies, team
representation, communication channels, and work-related practices
like sprint planning, retrospectives, and feature ownership. Creating
such a document helps foster better trust in teams. This post shares a
template for people to create a ‚Äúreadme‚Äù of their own to let
others on their team understand their working style. 

 THE ART OF WRITING RFCS (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 RFCs (Request For Comments) are documents proposing codebase changes
to address specific problems or introduce new features before actual
implementation begins. This post outlines when to write an RFC and
their benefits and offers guidance on writing one, including sections
like metadata, defining the problem, proposing solutions, and
addressing open questions. It also provides templates and tools for
creating RFCs.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NEW IN CHROME 120 (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Chrome 120 comes with the new CloseWatcher API, an API for directly
listening and responding to close requests. Close requests are
typically used to close popups and modals. They are typically the ESC
key on desktop platforms and the back gesture or button on Android.
Chrome 120 also comes with an easy-to-implement accordion pattern with
the details element, permission policy violation reports, and more. 

 DROPBASE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Dropbase is a platform for building internal web apps such as admin
panels and internal engineering tools with Python. It lets you import
your existing Python libraries and scripts, select UI components and
bind them to data, and use State and Context objects to modify state
and context directly with Python. Developers can share apps they
create on Dropbase with other users via roles, groups, permissions,
and other controls. 

 SUPERDUPERDB (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 SuperDuperDB is an open-source framework for integrating AI directly
with existing databases. The framework helps eliminate complex MLOps
pipelines and specialized vector databases by turning existing
databases into AI development and deployment environments. It supports
LLM chat, streaming inference, scalable model training, vector search,
and standard machine learning use cases.

 IMESSAGE, EXPLAINED (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This blog post provides a high-level overview of the internals of
iMessage. It covers the Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) and its
bidirectional capabilities, the role of IDS (Identity Services) as a
keyserver for iMessage's end-to-end encryption, and the process of
message encryption and decryption. 

 THE CURIOUS CASE OF THE AGGREGATION QUERY (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article shows how different SQL database systems execute a
peculiar SQL query, which involves subqueries and aggregation
functions. Some systems follow the SQL standard and return a single
row with the value 6, while others return values 3, 6, and 9 in a
table of three rows. The article delves into the SQL standard's
specifications regarding aggregation queries, outer references, and
historical changes in behavior among different database systems. 

 WHY TIERED STORAGE FOR APACHE KAFKA IS A BIG THING (10 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Apache Kafka has introduced Tiered Storage, which allows for the
separation of compute and storage. This article explores the
architecture, use cases, benefits, and even presents a case study of
storing petabytes of data in the Kafka commit log. Tiered Storage
optimizes storage resources by using different storage tiers based on
data access patterns, performance requirements, and cost
considerations.

 A website that shows how your computer reached the server the website
is hosted on. 

 CODE SPLITTING IN REACT: BOOSTING PERFORMANCE AND SPEED (3 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Code splitting involves breaking down JavaScript code into smaller
modules, optimizing performance by selectively loading necessary code,
and reducing initial load times. Implementing code splitting in React
can be achieved through dynamic imports and React.lazy() for
components. 

 12 LESSONS FROM 5 YEARS OF RUNNING A TECH MEETUP (12 MINUTE READ)
