 HK Regulators to Host Meeting to Help Crypto Firms With Banking (2 minute read)

Hong Kong regulators are planning a meeting between crypto firms and bankers on April 28 to improve financing opportunities for the sector, as the city aims to become a digital asset hub. The round table, organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission, intends to encourage dialogue and share experiences in opening and maintaining bank accounts. Although Hong Kong is working to become a center for digital assets and Web3 firms, strict know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules have made establishing banking relationships challenging.

 DAO Token Holders are Plausibly Liable, Judge Rules in bZx Class Action (2 minute read)

A US judge ruled that bZx DAO is plausibly a general partnership, denying a motion to dismiss token holders as defendants in a class-action lawsuit focused on a $55 million hack in November 2021. The court found that plaintiffs provided enough facts to qualify defendants who hold the DAO's governance tokens as members of the general partnership, making them potentially liable for the group's obligations. The court agreed that DAO token holders owed a duty of care to protocol investors and failed to ensure adequate security. Plaintiffs claim they lost $1.7 million in the attack.

 Newly Formed ZeroSync Association Brings Zero-Knowledge Proofs to Bitcoin (3 minute read)

Three German computer scientists founded the Swiss nonprofit ZeroSync Association to scale Bitcoin using zero-knowledge proofs, a popular cryptographic technique on Ethereum. Zk-proofs allow validation of information without revealing the data itself. ZeroSync has developed a prototype to validate the Bitcoin blockchain state and transaction history without downloading the entire chain or relying on a third party. Although still a work-in-progress, this proof system could enable various applications, such as proof-of-reserves on exchanges and transaction history compression on second-layer protocols like Lightning Labs' Taro.
