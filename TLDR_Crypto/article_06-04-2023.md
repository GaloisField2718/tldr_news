 Binance Rejected Justin SunE28099s Offer to Buy His Huobi Stake: Source (2 minute read)

Binance has reportedly declined an offer to acquire Tron founder Justin Sun's ahres in competing exchange Huobi. Binance's disinterest stems from Huobi's rumored ties to mainland China, which Binance has avoided having a presence in ever since moving from the country. Sun's involvement with Huobi remains mysterious, as he is confirmed to be a leader of the company that purchased Huobi but has dismissed speculation about selling his stake. The acquisition offer was allegedly made directly to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao by Sun, who later denied the claim on Twitter.

 Ethereum Projects Come Together on MEV Blocker RPC Launch to Share Profits with Users (3 minute read)

To help protect users from MEV attacks like front-running and sandwiching, over 30 Ethereum projects worked together to launch MEV Blocker RPC. Developed by CoW Swap, Agnostic Relay, and Beaver Build, MEV Blocker RPC routes user transactions to a network of "searchers" instead of the public memory pool, allowing searchers to bundle transactions privately and create backruns that are then submitted to block builders. The MEV profits from this process are then split between users submitting transactions and searchers: 90% to users and 10% to searchers.

 Checks and balances: Machine Learning and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (15 minute read)</a>
Zero-knowledge proofs have been vital for scaling and privacy in blockchains. Now, advancements enable users to demand trustlessness and verifiability from all digital products, including machine learning models. Though still in early stages, zero-knowledge proofs can represent machine learning applications as arithmetic circuits, allowing verification without revealing private inputs. With improvements in algorithms and proof systems, it will be possible to verify complex models efficiently. This innovation pushes for open-source AI models with auditable, privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs, bridging the gap between blockchain benefits and the expanding world of machine learning.

### Summary 
 Based Rollup DesignE28094Superpowers from L1 Sequencing (4 minute read)

A recently proposed design, "Based" or "L1-sequenced" rollups are a subset of rollups with sequencing driven by the base L1, inheriting its liveness and decentralization. Advantages include liveness guarantees, decentralization, simplicity, cost efficiency, L1 economic alignment, and sovereignty. Disadvantages include no MEV income and constrained sequencing. Based rollups can offer improved security, decentralization, and alignment with the L1, potentially dominating the rollup landscape and maximizing revenue.
