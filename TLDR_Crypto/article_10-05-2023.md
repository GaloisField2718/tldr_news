 Jane Street, Jump Pull Back Crypto Trading Over US Regulatory Uncertainty (3 minute read)</a>
Over the past few days, order book sleuths have been reporting some anomalies in flows and bid/ask spreads. Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that market-making firms Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto are winding down their market-making activities in the US due to increased regulatory scrutiny. Jane Street is also scaling back its global crypto operations, while Jump Crypto is focusing on international expansion. Both firms continue to make markets in crypto but on a smaller scale. These moves explain the thin order books and abnormalities weE28099ve been seeing.

 U.S. Exchanges List More Than a Dozen Cryptos the SEC Says Are Illegal to Sell (2 minute read)

Further, SEC Chair Gary Gensler believes most current crypto tokens fall within this category, making their distribution potentially illegal. However, the SEC only really has the authority to regulate coins classified as securities. Despite warnings since 2017, only a small percentage of cryptocurrencies have been addressed through enforcement. This has led to complaints that regulators are using strong-arm tactics to expand their jurisdiction without giving clear frameworks around regulation.

 Kakarot: an Intro to the First Modular zkEVM (5 minute read)

Kakarot, a project aiming to build a zkEVM on CairoVM, has achieved 100% bytecode equivalence and implemented 8 out of 9 EVM precompiles. This enables dApps written in Solidity or other EVM-supported languages to be deployed on Kakarot without code modifications. Instead of launching as a general-purpose zkEVM L2, Kakarot plans to bring EVM compatibility to Starknet and create a zkRollup-as-a-service tool, enabling app-specific L3s with one click. The aim of Cairo is to be the best toolbox for zero-knowledge engineering and development.
