NEWS & TRENDS

 WHAT'S CHANGING WITH AI MONETIZATION (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Traditional SaaS pricing relies on feature-based Good-Better-Best
tiers, but AI products are shifting toward skill-based pricing where
customers pay for quality and capability rather than feature access.
Instead of gating features, companies charge based on service levels -
accuracy, speed, and model capabilities - similar to how you'd pay
different rates for junior versus senior talent. 

 LEAN GRAPH THEORY (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Organizations can benefit from incorporating Lean principles, but
their application must be adapted to the specific context, whether
that involves linear workflows, branching dependencies, or dynamic
networks. By understanding and balancing the interplay of path, DAG,
and network models, companies can better navigate scaling challenges,
stabilize operations, and foster innovation while aligning their
structures with evolving strategies.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE BALANCED APPROACH TO BIG DECISIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Product managers often make decisions with limited data, requiring a
blend of intuition and analysis. Rather than waiting for perfect
information, treat intuitive decisions as hypotheses to test, learn
from, and refine. This balanced approach allows for confident
decision-making while maintaining room for growth and adjustment. 

 2025 MIGHT BE THE YEAR OF AI AGENTS, IF THEY CAN SURVIVE ENTERPRISE
HELL (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While AI agents show promise for automating enterprise workflows, the
reality is more complex than it appears due to fragmented systems,
custom business logic, and integration challenges. Though AI leaders
predict significant changes by 2025, successful automation will likely
emerge through specialized, targeted solutions rather than immediate
end-to-end automation, focusing on specific workflows before expanding
to broader applications.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW I GIVE HIGH-QUALITY FEEDBACK QUICKLY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Providing high-quality, fast feedback is possible by focusing on the
most impactful areas, offering structural guidance before diving into
details, and leveraging tools like Loom for efficient communication.
By balancing what's sustainable for the feedback giver and actionable
for the recipient, leaders can teach their teams to improve
independently while scaling their judgment across the organization. 

 WRITING REFERENCES AND REVIEWS (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Effective recommendations and reviews require four key elements:
understanding your audience's needs, having deep knowledge of what
you're reviewing, providing descriptive evidence rather than generic
praise, and writing concisely with authentic emotion. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 I MASSIVELY SCREWED UP A BIG PRODUCT LAUNCH (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This particular product launch failed due to insufficient early
marketing involvement and misaligned messaging, which left potential
customers unaware of the course's value proposition. After gathering
feedback and identifying that business case development was a more
relevant focus for their audience, the author repositioned the course
and highlighted the importance of integrating marketing into product
planning from the outset. 

 HOW DOES EMOTIONAL DESIGN TALK TO YOUR BRAIN? (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Emotional design focuses on creating experiences that connect with
users on a personal level through intentional use of colors, forms,
and interfaces that trigger positive emotional responses. The goal is
to transform digital interactions from merely functional to memorable,
while carefully balancing personalization with ethical considerations.

 IS YOUR RETENTION "TOO GOOD‚Äù? (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Extremely high retention in B2C subscriptions may indicate overly
safe marketing to core customers only. 

 TESTS OF THE PRODUCT MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The product model equips companies with the skills to respond
effectively to major opportunities and threats, as demonstrated during
the pandemic and now with the rise of generative AI.
