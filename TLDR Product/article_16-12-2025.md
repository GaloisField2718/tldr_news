NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY NERDS ARE MORE CLIPPABLE (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The rise of podcast-to-clip media has made nerds more influential by
rewarding nonlinear, idea-rich thinking over polished linear
storytelling. Through McLuhan's Laws of Media, this format enhances
idea discovery, replaces traditional broadcasting, revives
pamphleteering, and is now becoming institutionalized at scale. 

 GREAT STRATEGY GIVES YOU PERMISSION TO SAY "NO" (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Strategy isn't about saying yes to everything that fits a narrative.
It's about making hard choices that turn focus, goals, and discovery
into real progress. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY FEATURE ROADMAPS DON'T WORK FOR EARLY-STAGE STARTUPS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Early-stage startups often mistake feature roadmaps for certainty.
This limits learning and makes adaptation harder as new insights
emerge. 

 USE IT OR LOSE IT (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Use AI deliberately, or lose the skills that make you effective. The
best managers stay close to the work, think first, and let AI assist
rather than replace their judgment.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 INNOVATIVE PAYMENTS SOLUTIONS TO INSPIRE YOUR CEO. A TRACK RECORD
YOUR CTO CAN BANK ON. (SPONSOR) [9]

payments platform. Choose reliability and agility [9] 

 YOUR PROMPTS ARE BROKEN (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI works best when you treat it as a collaborator, not a vending
machine. Empathy, clarity, and perspective-taking outperform clever
prompts every time. 

 WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, WITH THIS HUMAN? (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Hiring well starts with seeing people clearly. Self-awareness,
context, and trusted references matter more than any interview
technique.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW MUCH EQUITY CAN YOU GIVE TO EMPLOYEES BEFORE IT'S A PROBLEM? (8
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Dilution isn't driven by SBC alone. It's driven by growth, valuation,
and how wisely equity is used. 

 WORDS! DAMNED WORDS! (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Words don't fail organizations. Reified models do. The cure is
designing systems that tolerate ambiguity, span abstraction levels,
and stay anchored in real work.
