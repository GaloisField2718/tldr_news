NEWS & TRENDS

 ROI: SEDUCTIVE BUT OF LIMITED VALUE IN PRODUCT PLANNING (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 ROI, a fundamental tool for financial decisions, is unreliable for
product and engineering planning due to uncertainty in both
development costs and future revenue projections. Instead of relying
on misleading ROI calculations, product leaders should focus on
strategic alignment, broad revenue ranges, realistic team costs, and
reframing discussions to highlight trade-offs and risks, ensuring that
investment decisions are grounded in market insight rather than false
precision. 

 ANOTHER ONE (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The rise of open-source LLMs like DeepSeek has shattered assumptions
about AI development, showing that state-of-the-art models can emerge
rapidly, disrupting markets and making proprietary models less
defensible. This shift suggests that the future of AI is not just
about incremental improvements but about a world where thousands of
unpredictable models emerge, reshaping industries in ways that go far
beyond automation and efficiency.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 CUSTOMERS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR AI FEATURE (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Overusing "AI-powered" in marketing can lower expectations and fail
to build trust or justify higher prices. Instead, focus on clear,
tangible benefits and real outcomes that solve user problems to drive
engagement and loyalty. 

 LONE WOLF OR OVER-COLLABORATOR? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Product managers risk imbalance: Lone Wolves work in isolation,
facing missed context and pushback, while Over-Collaborators
over-prioritize consensus, leading to delays and inefficiency. Lone
Wolves should seek feedback and communicate updates, while
Over-Collaborators should limit meetings and focus on deadlines.
Balancing collaboration and focus is crucial for success.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 ALLOCATION MODELS: THE C-SUITE IMPERATIVE (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Allocation models help prioritize and focus resources effectively,
preventing scattered efforts and misalignment. Teams can align and
make consistent trade-offs by clearly defining priorities. Regular
communication, conflict resolution, and reinforcement of these models
ensure teams stay focused, driving greater impact and preventing
resource dilution. 

 WHY ULTRA-SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS DISAPPEAR DAILY (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Viral products like Wordle, BeReal, and Thursday thrive by limiting
availability and boosting retention and social buzz through scarcity
and shared experiences. Strategies like daily exclusives, power hours,
or time-bound events turn products into must-use moments, increasing
engagement and word of mouth. Less access drives more excitement and
virality.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE AI INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD-OUT DEBATE JUST GOT DEEPER (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 DeepSeek's R1 release has disrupted AI infrastructure debates by
proving that high-performing models can be trained at significantly
lower costs, challenging the massive capital expenditures of Big Tech.
While this raises questions about AI infrastructure overspending, some
argue that efficiency gains could actually increase compute demand,
signaling a shift in focus from sheer growth to margin optimization
and inference scaling. 

 WHY DEEPSEEK IS A GIFT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DeepSeek's open-source leap reveals the failure of restrictive U.S.
AI policies, accelerating AI's Jevons effect - greater efficiency
driving greater demand. To stay competitive, the U.S. must embrace
open innovation, reduce regulation, and promote entrepreneurship to
lead the AI revolution.

 OPENAI IS AN APP COMPANY NOW (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI must sustain product innovation and user engagement to stay
ahead of growing competition like DeepSeek. 

 IN 2025, STOP TRYING TO GET BETTER AT OKRS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Teams should focus on treating OKRs as a product that measures
progress toward strategic priorities rather than striving for
technical correctness.
