NEWS & TRENDS

 IS OPENAI'S NEW ‚ÄúO1‚Äù MODEL THE BIG STEP FORWARD WE'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR? (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's new release shows continued innovation despite staff exits.
Writing-focused users may be disappointed, but coders and researchers
will be thrilled. While the models hint at future AI agents, 'agentic
AI' remains distant. 

 SHARPENING JUDGMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 To advance your career, focus on improving decision-making, which
requires a strong decision model, rich data, and mental clarity. A
well-developed decision model guides choices based on subconscious
frameworks. Better data, such as extended evaluations or comprehensive
feedback, enhances decisions. Mental clarity is essential - stress and
negative emotions can impair judgment, so prioritize maintaining
clear, focused thinking.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 EFFECTIVE MEETING DESIGN: MAXIMIZING PRODUCTIVITY AND INNOVATION (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meetings can be valuable if they have clear objectives, a focused
agenda, and proper preparation. Foster inclusivity by encouraging
diverse perspectives and using both synchronous and asynchronous
collaboration. Keep discussions on track by separating discussion from
decision-making and using timeboxing to manage conversations
efficiently. 

 IS AI MAKING SAAS OBSOLETE? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI is reshaping business operations, leading some to consider
in-house solutions over SaaS. However, over-reliance on AI risks
losing the human touch that fosters trust and long-term growth. SaaS
must adapt while ensuring customer connection isn't sacrificed in the
push for automation. 

 EVERY WHITE-COLLAR ROLE WILL HAVE AN AI COPILOT. THEN AN AI AGENT (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI copilots will be crucial in white-collar jobs. Some jobs will be
fully automated by AI agents. Startups can compete by targeting
upstream tasks, solving external workflow pain points, and building
multimodal systems of record using LLMs for real-time data
integration.

 AI PHOBIA: HOW NEWS HEADLINES SHAPE PUBLIC FEAR OF ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE (6 MINUTE READ) [14]
