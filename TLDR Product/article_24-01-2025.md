 EMBRACING UNCERTAINTY: A MODERN TAKE ON STRATEGY, GOALS, AND ROADMAPS
(7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Embracing uncertainty in product strategy and management is a
competitive advantage, as traditional approaches to planning and
roadmapping often create a false sense of predictability. Teams can
navigate uncertainty more effectively and deliver higher value by
focusing on outcomes over output, integrating evidence-based learning,
exploring multiple strategic options, and adopting flexible frameworks
like OKRs or outcome-based roadmaps.

READ) [5]

adoption and tools like Cursor reshaping development. Well-crafted
tools like Linear and Notion disrupt incumbents, prioritizing user
experience over features. Teams increasingly mix and match tools for
nuanced needs, signaling a shift toward flexibility and innovation in
modern tech stacks.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE CAPACITY ALLOCATION ILLUSION (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Capacity in software development goes beyond simple time tracking or
resource allocation - it represents the cumulative result of long-term
investments in people, processes, and systems, as well as the
organization's ability to adapt, innovate, and sustain itself. Leaders
should look beyond reductive time-allocation metrics and instead focus
on how capacity is built, maintained, and optimized for strategic
alignment and long-term success.

 THE 5 HIDDEN RULES BEHIND SUCCESSFUL AI PRODUCTS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The key to building successful AI products, as exemplified by
Granola, lies in focusing on narrow use cases that deliver exceptional
experiences, leveraging context to create meaningful interactions, and
aligning user feedback with cohesive product intuition. Granola
demonstrates this by tackling the nuanced problems of AI-driven
meeting notes, emphasizing simplicity, adaptability, and the potential
for AI tools to amplify human focus on strategic tasks. 

 TURN AI CONVERSATIONS INTO CREATIVE CAPITAL (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Transform AI interactions into lasting creative assets by preserving
key outputs like insights and prompts in portable formats. Avoid

guide organization. Systematic curation turns AI conversations into
reusable tools, compounding value over time.

 NO, I DON'T WANT TO HOP ON A CALL (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Defaulting to a call instead of drafting a clear written response
often stems from avoiding the mental effort of clarifying one's
thoughts, but this approach creates inefficiency for everyone
involved. Instead, invest time upfront to craft a well-thought-out
written reply to save collective time, foster better communication,
and ensure others perceive you as organized and capable. 

 HOW WE MAKE MONEY HERE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Starting with a clear explanation of how the company makes money
aligns employees with its financial goals. Clarify who pays, what they
pay, when revenue comes in, the market size, and future opportunities.
This builds smarter decision-making, motivation, and agency,
connecting individual roles to the company's bigger picture.
