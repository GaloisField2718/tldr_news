NEWS & TRENDS

 RESILIENCY AND SCALE (16 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Our systems, optimized for efficiency and scale, have become fragile.
Whether in data, manufacturing, or information, the drive for lower
costs and centralization has sacrificed resiliency. Rebuilding it will
require expensive shifts toward redundancy and local control. 

 THE RIGHT TO BEAR TECHNOLOGY (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Second Amendment is America's original right to technology, the
tool that enforces our freedoms. From Cold War missile labs to modern
Silicon Valley, US innovation has always balanced ideals with
strength. Our tech sector must remember its duty to protect both. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 YOUR PRICING IS (PROBABLY) BROKEN (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most leaders know their pricing isn't perfect, and that's normal.
Every model has tradeoffs, so the goal isn't to overhaul it but to
adjust it. Add clear tiers, smart upsells, and flexible levers that
better match your product's value and growth story. 

 PRIORITIZATION STARTS WITH STRATEGIC PRIORITIZATION (9 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Prioritization is strategy. Every ranking of value or urgency
reflects a choice about where to build or defend advantage. By mapping
benefits, drivers, and enduring “powers,” teams can focus less on
quick wins and more on investments that compound over time.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 DON'T SACRIFICE AGILITY FOR STABILITY (SPONSOR) [9]

scale and reliability. With Marqeta, launch payments experiences [9]
that perform at scale and grow with your business. From optimizing

experiences, Marqeta's solutions are designed for longevity. See what

 BEYOND RELEASE MANAGEMENT: FEATURE FLAGS FOR PRODUCT DISCOVERY (9
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Feature flags can accelerate learning, not just control rollouts.
Teams can turn guesswork into fast, confident product decisions by
using painted doors to test demand, dogfooding to refine value, and
targeted betas to validate functionality. 

 ONLY 100 METRICS MATTER (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Businesses drown in data, but only a small core truly drives
understanding: about 100 metrics, 50 key events, and 150 defining
attributes. When these are structured through clear equations and
semantic links, teams replace noise with insight, and AI becomes a
reasoning partner, not just a reporting tool. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHEN YOUR METRICS START MANAGING YOU (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Teams fail when they chase metrics instead of meaning. The piece
offers five principles for measuring what matters: start with
outcomes, balance multiple metrics, favor leading over lagging
indicators, add qualitative context, and design dashboards that reveal
insight instead of confirming bias.

test ideas in minutes rather than weeks. Jaclyn Konzelmann's
frameworks teach PMs to think big, launch fast, and evolve constantly,
