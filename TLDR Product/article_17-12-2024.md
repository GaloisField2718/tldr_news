MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Shiny object syndrome is the destructive tendency to abandon existing

 FAQ: OKR NOT WORKING IN MY COMPANY (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The challenges companies face with implementing OKRs often stem from

 DON'T REINVENT USER PROFILING DURING ONBOARDING. THIS IS WHAT IT
SHOULD LOOK LIKE (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Effective user profiling using first-party data is crucial for
tailoring product experiences, optimizing activation rates, and
ensuring personalized engagement, especially in B2B contexts. By
following a structured onboarding process - focusing on user intent,
company details, team invitations, and use cases - you can minimize
drop-offs, enhance data quality, and uncover valuable insights for
growth, segmentation, and product development. 

 READING THE ROOM/KNOWING YOUR AUDIENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [11]

often doesn't care about development processes and technical details.
Success comes from quickly assessing what the audience needs and
adapting your communication style accordingly.

 BREAKING THE AI AGREEABILITY TRAP (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The tendency of AI language models to excessively agree with users
(sycophancy) limits their potential as creative collaborators, but
this can be overcome by treating interactions as open dialogues, using
neutral language, actively seeking critique, and building iterative
conversations that allow for deeper engagement and honest feedback. 

 IS THIS A CAREER? (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Reaching a high level of skill in most areas is relatively achievable
with deliberate practice, but true greatness lies in a vastly steeper
domain-specific climb that generalists often overlook. For data
professionals, becoming impactful means choosing a specific field to
master rather than remaining a broadly skilled analyst, as domain
expertise paired with analytical skill outshines general proficiency.

to create initial prototypes through accessible frameworks like
customer journey mapping and Jobs-to-be-done, regardless of their
formal design training.
