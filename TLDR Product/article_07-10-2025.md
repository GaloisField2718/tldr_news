 AI AT WORK: WHAT YOUR TEAMS WISH YOU KNEW (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Miro surveyed 2,000+ engineering, product, and design professionals
on AI adoption. The surprising finding? While 75% are optimistic about
AI's potential and twice as likely to feel excited rather than anxious
[4], one-third aren't using AI tools at all—with product teams
lagging furthest behind.

The barrier isn't fear or skepticism; it's knowing where to start.
Teams succeeding with AI aren't the most technical—they're the ones
with leadership support that makes experimentation feel safe [4]
rather than risky. The report includes a three-part framework for
moving teams from AI curiosity to confidence.

NEWS & TRENDS

 THE AI APPLICATION SPENDING REPORT: WHERE STARTUP DOLLARS REALLY GO
(7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI-native startups are redefining software by integrating AI into
every workflow, unlike big firms gaining only incremental gains.
Emerging trends show horizontal dominance, rising “vibe coding,”
and consumer-to-enterprise product evolution driving widespread AI
adoption. 

 SORA, AI BICYCLES, AND META DISRUPTION (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sora wins by making creation effortless for everyone, which could
upend Instagram's entertainment feed, weaken Meta's attention model,
and redefine who gets to be a creator. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 MALTE SCHOLTZ ON FIXING MISALIGNMENT, MASTERING AI FLUENCY, AND THE
VALUE OF PRODUCT OPS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Product success depends on alignment built through trust and shared
context, not control. As AI automates tasks, PMs must excel in data
storytelling, influence, and Product Ops to scale clarity and impact. 

 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ITERATION AND TRUE INNOVATION (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Iteration refines what exists. Innovation redefines what's possible.
True innovation challenges assumptions, embraces risk, and creates new
value, while iteration sustains progress through steady improvement.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 COST-PLUS CREDITS MODELS ARE A QUICK FIX FOR AI MONETIZATION - NOT
THE FINAL DESTINATION (SPONSOR) [9] 

 In cost-plus credit models, customers prepay for credits, which are
consumed when they run AI-powered tasks. They're popular with everyone
from new startups to players like OpenAI - but they also create
misalignment between pricing and customer value [9]. Read about the
limitations of AI credits (and what comes next) on the Metronome blog.

 AI & COGNITIVE DEBT (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI enhances productivity but risks dulling our cognitive “create
mode” by pushing us into passive “review mode.” To stay sharp,
outsource knowledge to AI but protect reasoning - use it to learn, not
to think for you. 

 HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE 2025 IA SUMMIT (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI's future is shifting toward agent-first systems, smarter
infrastructure, and new human-AI interfaces. Startups and incumbents
alike are racing to embed reasoning, context, and adaptability into
every workflow.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE DEATH OF SEARCH: HOW SHOPPING WILL WORK IN THE AGE OF AI (45
MINUTE VIDEO) [12] 

 AI will own mid-funnel shopping by researching and auto-buying clear
SKUs at the best price, pressuring search and affiliate economics,
while impulse and big in-person purchases stay largely human. Expect
trust-first curation and AI-native tools to reshape pricing,
recommendations, and checkout. 

 LET'S MAKE IT AWKWARD (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Embracing discomfort can reclaim power and drive change. Speaking up,
even when it feels awkward, challenges bias and redefines worth.

 SUCCESS IN SAAS (1 MINUTE READ) [15]

just product building.

 For consumer product builders, it's a one-month all-in bet - small
chance it's the next App Store, huge upside if you're early.
