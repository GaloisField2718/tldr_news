TLDR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 2025-05-30

 "BE DATA-DRIVEN" IS TERRIBLE ADVICE FOR PMS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 PMs today are told to choose data over instincts.

But blindly letting data take the wheel leads to generic metrics that
miss what matters — user insights that require customer connection.

This misalignment creates a false choice: ignore intuition or dismiss
data.

The result is a widening disconnect between product vision and user
needs.

The answer isn't choosing sides. It's using intuition to identify the
right metrics [4], then using those metrics to sharpen judgment
— enriching product taste and data.

In this playbook [4], Statsig's product leaders share how they use
data to deepen product sense, not replace it.

NEWS & TRENDS

 YOU SHOULD PLAY WITH VIBECODING FOR GTM (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI coding tools are transforming go-to-market teams by enabling
non-technical professionals to quickly build tools like landing pages,
ROI calculators, and lead forms. This speeds up execution, reduces
dependence on engineering, and unlocks cost-effective, creative
solutions to GTM challenges. 

 THE THING YOU ARE EXPERT AT WILL BE YOUR CAREER DOWNFALL (8 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Experts resist AI due to comfort, identity, and craft love, but
history shows tech shifts create new expertise. Adaptation involves
intentional AI experimentation, broadening identity to outcomes, and
embracing AI as a new creative domain. Recognizing AI's strengths
while valuing human elements is crucial for evolving expertise.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE ERA OF THE PRODUCT CREATOR (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A product manager's core job is to create products - not just
facilitate, manage projects, or maintain backlogs. As AI and
accessible tools empower more creators, PMs who don't drive product
creation risk falling behind in a shifting industry. 

 YOU CATCH EVERY RISK - SO WHY AREN'T YOU IN THE ROOM FOR THE BIG
DECISIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Effective PMs who excel at finding flaws can be excluded from
strategy if their assertiveness is perceived as rigidity. To gain
influence, they should shift from solely catching issues to guiding
outcomes by emphasizing shared goals, fostering team risk
identification, and prioritizing influence, thus becoming seen as
strategists. 

 PERFECT TEAMS DON'T EXIST. THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The idea of a perfect product team or process is a myth. Success
depends on context and constant evolution. Real product success
involves driving business value, increasing influence, improving user
outcomes, and advancing your career, despite imperfections. Focusing
on these areas, rather than chasing an ideal, leads to greater impact.

 WHEN TOO MUCH CYA BACKFIRES (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Performative CYA behavior can hurt your professional presence, even
if it's well-intentioned. Overly formal or deferential language can
make you seem insecure and prevent open communication, so it's better
to speak with calm confidence and show ownership rather than seeking
constant validation. 

 WHY GREAT IDEAS FAIL IN FINANCE: IT'S NOT THE DIGITAL PRODUCT, IT'S
THE UX (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Banks now compete through apps, where poor UX can cost customers. To

authentic branding to deliver personalized, trustworthy experiences,
and make UX a core leadership focus.
