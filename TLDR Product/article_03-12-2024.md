 4 LEVELS OF DATA PROFICIENCY (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Data is vital for product companies but prone to misuse due to
cognitive biases and cherry-picking, leading to flawed strategies.
Strong companies build systematic approaches with business models,
data-driven decision-making, and evidence-guided practices and
incorporate AI for enhanced data analysis and decision support. 

 HOW TO EXPERIMENT IN THE WORLD OF AI (7 MINUTE READ) [5]

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 PRODUCT MANAGER VS. PRODUCT OWNER: KEY DIFFERENCES (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Product managers (PMs) and product owners (POs) serve distinct yet
complementary roles in product development: PMs focus on strategic
vision, market research, and long-term planning (12-24 months), while
POs handle tactical execution, managing sprints and product backlogs
in shorter cycles (2-4 weeks). Both roles work together to align
strategic goals through practical implementation. 

 NAVIGATE THE AI WORKFORCE REVOLUTION: LESSONS FROM A CENTURY OF
DISRUPTION (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A century of technological shifts, from mass production to AI, has
continually redefined work, with each phase bringing both job
displacement and new opportunities. The current AI revolution, poised
to be the most transformative yet, demands rapid adaptation. It
highlights the need for hybrid human-AI collaboration, lifelong
learning, and strategic planning to navigate its widespread impact.

 HOW TO GET DEV TEAMS ONBOARD WITH PRODUCT EXPERIMENTATION —
O'REILLY GUIDE (SPONSOR) [8] 

 It shouldn't be an uphill battle to get engineering to embrace
product experiments. With the right systems in place – including
better feature flags with built-in measurement - it becomes a win-win:
Product teams test more hypotheses, devs reduce risk with faster
feedback loops. Read the guide by O'Reilly and Harness [8] to learn
more. 

 PRODUCT STRATEGY STACK VS. DECISION STACK: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The decision stack and product strategy stack differ in how they
connect strategy to actionable goals, with the former emphasizing
broad objectives and the latter focusing on measurable product goals.
Both frameworks are valuable tools for aligning strategy with
execution, but success depends on using them flexibly to clarify
decisions, identify gaps, and maintain alignment across teams. 

 BEING IN THE DETAILS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In a shift toward efficiency, tech companies are flattening
hierarchies, requiring managers to be more hands-on and directly
accountable for their teams' output. Effective management involves
deep engagement with details, balancing delegation with accountability
to ensure informed decisions and avoid abdication of responsibility.

AND THE FUTURE OF YOUR JOB (8 MINUTE READ) [11]

handle customer service and routine tasks, augmenting human workers'
capabilities rather than replacing them. 

 THE FTC IS INVESTIGATING UBER OVER ITS SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE (4 MINUTE
READ) [12]

probe into companies like Amazon and Adobe, this follows the agency's
'click-to-cancel' rule implementation in October. It is a response to
increasing consumer complaints about subscription services. U.S.
adults spend an average of $91 monthly on subscriptions and 48% report
