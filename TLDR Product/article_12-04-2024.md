NEWS & TRENDS

 THE ART OF PRODUCT MANAGEMENT IN THE FOG OF AI (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 PMs charged with integrating AI into product development must adapt
their traditional linear approach to design, embrace the unpredictable
nature of AI, and implement strategies such as fast feedback loops,
over-measurement of user experiences, and utilization of smaller
models to control output. They should ultimately aim to create
products that evolve alongside users.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 EXECUTION BEATS STRATEGY EVERY TIME (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Focusing on execution over strategy is crucial at Meta. Even with a
mediocre strategy but great execution, teams can learn and iterate
toward success. There is persistent refinement in product development
supported by allocating time, establishing a strong customer feedback
loop, and creating clear incentives. 

 BEING EMPATHETIC (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Empathy is important in understanding frustrations with go-to-market
partners and stakeholders. It is helpful to reframe discussions to
emphasize customer benefits, merchandize team accomplishments, and
foster a culture of generosity and listening within product teams to
better collaborate with other departments and address internal
challenges. 

 STRATEGY STORYTELLING: THE PRODUCT NARRATIVE CANVAS (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Product managers can effectively convey complex strategies through a
narrative approach. By framing product strategies as narratives that
align with organizational goals and user needs, managers can improve
understanding and enthusiasm among stakeholders, enhancing the
effectiveness of strategic discussions.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 IN COMMAND (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Striving to be "in command" entails being honest, introspective,
agile, aware, and proactive as a leader. It also involves actively
addressing challenges, managing expectations, embracing change, and
fostering a culture of accountability and autonomy within the
organization. 

 EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CUSTOMER ADVISORY BOARDS (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 A Customer Advisory Board (CAB) is a chosen group of customers who
offer feedback, insights, and advice to a company. This group usually
includes key customers with different needs from various demographics
and industries. CABs are crucial for companies as direct feedback from
their most important customers influences product strategy and
decisions. 

 HOW ECOSYSTEM-LED GROWTH UNLOCKS THE NEXT GENERATION OF GTM (34
MINUTE PODCAST) [13] 

 Ecosystem-led growth involves utilizing the data and relationships
within your partner ecosystem to enhance customer attraction,
conversion, and retention. It represents the GTM aspect of
partnerships and ecosystems, an area often overlooked or inaccurately
presented. By leveraging partners and their data, ecosystem-led growth
can significantly boost customer acquisition, account expansion, and
entry into new markets.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PRODUCTS VS. SERVICES (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Products are uniform, repeatable items purchased in a standard format
by consumers, while services provide customized experiences tailored
to each customer's needs. Understanding your position on the product
versus service spectrum is crucial for recognizing your current
status, future direction, and the steps necessary to achieve your
goals. 

 PRODUCT-LED GROWTH VS. SALES-LED GROWTH (29 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Product managers face a strategic choice between product-led and
sales-led growth, each befitting different business models and
customer needs. Product-led growth centers on the product's inherent
value driving user acquisition and expansion, while sales-led growth
relies on personalized customer relationships to convert and retain
clients.
