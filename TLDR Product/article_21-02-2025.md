NEWS & TRENDS

 IT'S TIME TO BUILD: HEALTHTECH INFRASTRUCTURE (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Healthtech infrastructure serves as the backbone of the healthcare
system, supporting core functions like transactions, data exchange,
and interoperability, but many legacy systems remain outdated and
inefficient. As healthcare evolves with new care models, payment
structures, and regulatory shifts, there will be significant
opportunities to modernize existing infrastructure and build new
foundational technologies, positioning companies in this space for
major growth and long-term impact. 

 EXPLORING FOR STRATEGY (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Exploration is a crucial first step in strategy creation. It prevents
premature commitment to familiar but potentially suboptimal solutions
by encouraging a broad evaluation of available options. By leveraging
internal precedents, external networks, and industry research, teams
can make informed decisions and avoid the costly mistakes that arise
from early anchoring on past experiences.

 WHERE WILL THE AI HORDE STRIKE NEXT? AI VIDEO, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND
HOLLYWOOD (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI disruption is inevitable across industries, with startups acting
aggressively while incumbents focus on defense and survival. In
Hollywood, AI could revolutionize content creation through tools, new
formats, and digital-native storytelling, but resistance from unions
and traditional players may slow adoption, leading to a mix of
disruption and assimilation. 

 DEVELOP ADJACENT SKILLS TO BECOME A SHARPER OPERATOR (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Great marketers excel not only in marketing but also in adjacent
disciplines such as sales, business analysis, psychology, product, and
design, which enhance their strategic thinking and execution. By
developing skills in negotiation, copywriting, and project management,
marketers can expand their influence, improve decision-making, and
bring ideas to life in a way that resonates with their audience.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO INSTILL URGENCY IN YOUR TEAM (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Leaders often struggle to instill urgency in their teams, as
extrinsic motivators like monetary incentives or fear-based tactics
create only temporary improvements and can even backfire by replacing
intrinsic motivation. Instead, leaders should foster an environment
where employees feel a sense of ownership, purpose, and growth, using
frameworks like the "Empowerment Handshake" to balance autonomy and
guidance, ultimately driving long-term engagement and productivity. 

 PRODUCT MANAGEMENT ISN'T GOING TO EXIST IN 5 YEARS (100 MINUTE
PODCAST) [9] 

 AI is reshaping product management by automating traditional PM
tasks, pushing engineers closer to customers, and increasing the
demand for hands-on, technical PMs who can build and iterate rapidly.
The future of product teams will favor product engineers, data-driven
decision-making, and a shift away from rigid handoff models, requiring
companies to balance speed with strategic prioritization to avoid
becoming inefficient feature factories.

 THE ROTATION PROGRAM THAT KEEPS THIS STARTUP'S ENGINEERS LEARNING —
AND NOT LEAVING (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Engineers leave after three years not just for equity refreshes, but
due to stalled learning and technical FOMO. Structured rotation
programs and open career conversations can help retain top talent. 

 HOW TO COMBINE PLG AND SALES-LED GROWTH IN B2B (8 MINUTE READ) [11]

and Sales-Led Growth to maximize adoption, deal size, and retention,
rather than treating them as competing strategies. In this post,
Hans-Jörg Roser outlines a practical hybrid model that includes
aligning product and sales through an integrated customer journey, a
shared sales playbook, and cross-functional collaboration, ensuring
that product insights and sales efforts reinforce each other for
sustained growth.
