NEWS & TRENDS

 AI IS KILLING SOME COMPANIES, YET OTHERS ARE THRIVING - LET'S LOOK AT
THE DATA (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI is reshaping content platforms, with sites like WebMD, Quora, and
Stack Overflow losing traffic as AI delivers instant answers, reducing
reliance on traditional search. Meanwhile, platforms that emphasize
community and authenticity, such as Reddit, Wikipedia, and Substack,
are thriving. This shift highlights the need for content businesses to
adapt by leveraging AI, rather than competing against it. 

 “I SCRATCHED MY OWN ITCH” ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Many leaders justify their startups with the claim, 'I had the
problem myself, so I built a product,' but this reasoning
oversimplifies the challenges of building a successful company. While
personal experience provides insight and motivation, success requires
a deep understanding of the market, customers, execution, and the
ability to adapt beyond one's initial perspective. Without this, the
startup is likely to fail.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE PRICE OF WINNING: CAN YOU BE A GREAT LEADER AND STILL BE LIKED?
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Successful leaders balance intensity with connection, pushing others
to excel while earning their trust. By setting high standards, leading
by example, and prioritizing team success, they drive excellence
without alienating people. The key is knowing when to push, how to
support, and when to step back in order to sustain both motivation and
relationships. 

 UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENT LEADERSHIP STYLES (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Strong leadership is adaptable, with different styles suiting
different teams and cultures. Effective leaders balance control,
decision-making, and communication according to team needs.
Understanding your leadership style and tailoring it to your team
fosters trust, collaboration, and long-term success. The key is
flexibility—great leaders listen, learn, and adjust to bring out the
best in their people.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 MAKING REAL PROGRESS - HOW PRODUCT TEAMS CAN CONNECT THE DOTS OF
STRATEGY, OKRS, AND DISCOVERY (32 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This deck from the Digitale Leute Summit explores how obsessing over
one domain can create the illusion of progress, how breaking down
strategy enables more decisive choices, and how integrating discovery
with OKRs drives meaningful progress. 

 THE 8-HOUR WINDOW MOST STARTUPS ARE MISSING 🪟 (4 MINUTE READ) [10]


 The best companies integrate their products into users' workflows
rather than waiting for visits. Chrome extensions, like Grammarly and
Loom, embed key features directly into daily online activities,
boosting retention, acquisition, and distribution. Businesses can
create high-value, free extensions that drive engagement by
identifying a common user action and enhancing it seamlessly.

 HACKING TOGETHER AI AGENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI development is becoming increasingly accessible, but non-technical
users still face challenges in setup, debugging, and fine-tuning.
Cloud models like OpenAI offer ease of use, while local tools like
Ollama provide privacy and control. No-code platforms simplify
deployment, yet customization remains limited. Advancing fine-tuning,
debugging, and AI workspaces will be key to broader adoption. 

 SHOULD MANAGERS STILL CODE? (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Engineering managers should be actively engaged with the codebase,
but not necessarily writing production code, as their primary impact
comes from enabling their team's success. While some managers may
choose to code, their focus should be on understanding architecture,
conducting thorough code reviews, debugging, and mentoring engineers
to maintain technical credibility without becoming a bottleneck.

 HOW DO I BUILD AI PRODUCTS THAT WORK? (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Many AI-infused experiments fail because they either feel gimmicky or
lack real value. 

 AVOID THE NIGHTMARE BICYCLE (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Product design should avoid oversimplifying concepts with unnecessary
labels because users can understand systematic structures with
practice.
