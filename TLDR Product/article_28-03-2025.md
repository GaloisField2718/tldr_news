 THE PROVEN PLAYBOOK FOR SHIFTING TO USAGE BASED PRICING (SPONSOR) [4]


 First came perpetual licenses. Next, the age of MRR. Now, software
pricing has entered its third, and potentially most lucrative era:
usage-based pricing. Thousands of SaaS companies have already evolved
their pricing. What about you?

Metronome CEO and co-founder Scott Woody wrote a detailed,
step-by-step playbook [4] on how to shift from legacy pricing models
to UBP—from hiring a "Chief Alignment Officer" to over-communicating
changes with customers.

It's practical, packed with case studies and best practices, and
completely free to read [4] (no registration required).

NEWS & TRENDS

 DEVELOPING A TRANSFORMATIONAL VISION FOR AI AND BEYOND (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Companies must envision long-term industry shifts to build a strong
AI strategy, aligning with Amara's Law, which highlights our tendency
to overestimate short-term impacts but underestimate long-term
effects. Businesses can innovate proactively instead of merely
following trends by anticipating changes in jobs and customer needs. 

 SCARCITY AND ABUNDANCE IN 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Three key themes have emerged in technology's shift from scarcity to
abundance: code evolving from capital to labor, AI's relentless Red
Queen's Race, and AI agents reshaping economic activity. The greatest
impact lies in decentralized, market-driven applications, with onchain
agents and stablecoin-based AI transactions leading the way.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 BEYOND DIRECT SALES (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Channel partnerships boost reach and revenue but work best after
product-market fit and without sales conflicts. Product managers
should choose low-friction partners, streamline enablement, and
balance growth with direct sales. 

 IT'S NOT BRAND VS. GROWTH (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Brand-market fit is as crucial as product-market fit but often
overlooked. Companies like Notion, Figma, and Canva treat their brands
as growth engines, driving organic acquisition, engagement, and
loyalty from the start.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 THE ANTI-PATTERN PLAYBOOK (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Product teams often ship features aimlessly, driven by noise instead
of user needs. To escape this cycle, they must focus on outcomes, run
smaller experiments, and strengthen stakeholder relationships. 

 THE 12 TYPES OF PRODUCT MANAGERS: WHAT PRODUCT MANAGER CAN YOU
BECOME? (19 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Product managers specialize in areas like Technical, Growth, AI, and
Enterprise, each suited to different business needs. Knowing these
roles helps PMs align strengths for greater impact and career
fulfillment.

 WHY DON'T OUR LEADERS CARE ABOUT HOW WE WORK? (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Most companies undervalue intentional operating system design,
defaulting instead to ad hoc processes shaped by urgency, habit, and
limited awareness. Without leadership buy-in or systems-thinking
skills, change efforts often stall amid skepticism, inertia, and
misaligned incentives. 

 CREATIVITY AS YOUR LEADERSHIP ADVANTAGE IN GENAI LEADERSHIP (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 GenAI accelerates innovation, making creativity the key competitive
edge as execution speeds up. With software development no longer a
differentiator, leaders must cultivate creativity to captivate
customers and stay ahead.

 WHY ARE GOOGLE'S AI PRODUCTS SO FRUSTRATING TO USE? (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Google's AI products suffer from confusing UX, fragmentation, and
hidden features. 

 USE "BUT" STRATEGICALLY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The "Inverted But Technique" improves communication by flipping
negative and positive statements, making feedback more encouraging.
