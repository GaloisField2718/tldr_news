over 2,600 companies [4], it helps you answer:

NEWS & TRENDS

 PLG VS AI: WHAT'S NEXT FOR PRODUCT-LED GROWTH? (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 PLG isn't dying - it's evolving. AI will supercharge personalization,
automate growth basics, and create agentic products that guide users,
turning PLG into a co-pilot for activation, retention, and expansion. 

 FORWARD DEPLOYED ENGINEERS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Forward Deployed Engineers embed with customers to uncover real
problems and outcomes. Popularized by Palantir, this model, paired
with prototyping and platform strategies, can help any team create
scalable, effective products.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 SKIP-LEVEL WITHOUT A SAFETY NET (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Skip-level readouts often overwhelm product managers, but a
disciplined 3-slide structure - context, response, next steps -
delivers clarity fast. This builds trust, strengthens leadership
alignment, and accelerates career growth. 

 I BELIEVE IN INTERIM CPO ROLES, BUT NOT IN FRACTIONAL CPO ROLES (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Interim CPO roles can succeed, but fractional ones don't - product
leadership is too unpredictable for part-time work. The most valuable
task of an interim CPO is stabilizing the team and hiring their
full-time successor.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 OBSERVABILITY MISSES MICRO-OUTAGES. YOUR CUSTOMERS DON'T (SPONSOR)
[9] 

 Micro outages — brief, localized issues — can silently break
critical workflows without triggering alerts. The result can be broken
workflows that impact revenue and customer experience, and which
developers struggle to root-cause. Read the white paper [9] to learn
how unitQ uses real-time customer feedback [9] to expose blind spots
in your observability stack. 

 TURNING INSIGHTS INTO GROWTH AND REVENUE (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A UX research repository transforms scattered insights into a single
source of truth, driving efficiency, alignment, and revenue. With AI
and governance, it fuels user-centric decisions and continuous
business growth. 

 BRIAN ELLIOTT ON CULTURE CHAOS, RUTHLESS CLARITY, AND WHY EMPATHY
FUELS VELOCITY (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Product challenges are often cultural, not technical. Leaders should
drive clarity on priorities, build dependable trust, balance
performance with growth, and embed empathy to sustain velocity and
innovation. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 YOUR STAKEHOLDERS AREN'T WRONG ABOUT THE PROBLEMS (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Stakeholder intuition often signals real pain, but delivery rarely
guarantees adoption. Success comes from post-launch iteration: observe
users, map workflows, fix discovery, measure outcomes, and investigate
time-boxes to protect investment. 

 IS IT TIME TO LOOK FOR A NEW JOB? AND HOW DO I START? (5 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Job doubts can create a draining limbo, but a structured search can
break the cycle. With a clear plan, a strong personal pitch, and
weekly time carved out, you can turn uncertainty into clarity and
either re-energize in your current role or confidently step into a new
one.

MINUTE READ) [14]

researching, negotiating, buying, and selling. 

 CURE FOR HALLUCINATIONS (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Adding probability-based prompts helps separate imaginative output
