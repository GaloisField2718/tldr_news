NEWS & TRENDS

 PRODUCT MANAGERS MISUNDERSTOOD: WE DON'T ‘RULE' SILICON VALLEY—WE
NAVIGATE ITS COMPLEXITIES (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Product managers are navigators, not rulers, balancing diverse
demands to build the right product for the right reasons. Their role
requires influence without authority, empathy without bias, and vision
under pressure. Mislabeling PMs as “mini-CEOs” or obstacles to
engineers undervalues their critical role in driving innovation and
delivering customer value. 

 WHY YOUR FEELINGS AS A LEADER MATTER — AND HOW TO MANAGE THEM (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Leadership can be isolating, with few clear indicators of success.
The emotional weight of decision-making is intensified in hybrid work
environments where over half of managers report burnout. Managing
emotions through strategies like self-awareness, breathing exercises,
peer connections, gratitude, and physical activity enhances emotional
regulation, which is crucial not only for personal well-being but also
for fostering trust, motivation, and high-performing teams.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DATA-INFORMED, NOT DATA-DRIVEN (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Being data-driven can lead to biased decision-making if the data is
interpreted or collected without critical examination, as biases often
creep in. Adopting a data-informed approach - using diverse data
points, falsification over confirmation, and reflection - ensures that
data augments decisions rather than driving them blindly, fostering
better judgment and strategic insights. 

 THE PRODUCT MANAGER CAREER PATH IS NOT A STRAIGHT LINE (20 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The PM career path is flexible and unique, with no single route to
success. It's less a ladder and more a branching tree, rooted in
diverse skills and opportunities. Whether just starting out or
considering your next move, there's no “right” path - just the one
that aligns with your goals. Embrace the unexpected, leverage your
skills, and view every twist as a chance to grow.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 WHAT'S AN ACTIVE USER? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Defining "active users" accurately is critical, as arbitrary
definitions can mislead product and financial strategies. Strava
determines active users by focusing on meaningful user engagement,
segmenting active users into cohorts like NURR, CURR, and RRR, and
tracking behaviors tied to retention. This allows for the creation of
tailored strategies that enhance activation, engagement, and long-term
growth. 

 GENERATIVE AI UX — DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE USE CASES FOR THE
ENTERPRISE (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Building innovative enterprise Gen AI experiences requires balancing
user needs, business goals, and Gen AI's benefits and risks. Unlike
traditional logic-based products, Gen AI introduces trust, control,
and agency concerns. To create valuable products, teams must reassess
and adjust their product development process and use frameworks that
ensure Gen AI adds value appropriately.

 SHIFTING FROM ENVY TO APPRECIATION (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This author's relationship with Twitter evolved from a space of
connection to one fostering comparison and envy, triggering self-doubt
and disconnection. He found freedom and joy in embracing his own
uniqueness and celebrating others' successes by recognizing envy as a
signal of unmet desires and shifting focus toward self-awareness,
appreciation, and collaboration. 

 THE TRUTH OF DIGITAL NOMADS: THE LONG WAY HOME AND WHAT IT REALLY
TEACHES US (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Digital nomading fosters resilience, adaptability, and
self-discovery. Despite the stress of constant relocation and
work-life balance, it encourages spiritual growth through cultural
exposure and nurtures gratitude for the community and culture that
shaped one's identity.
