 INTRODUCING PARAGRAPH ‚Äî INTEGRATIONS AS CODE FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING
USER-FACING INTEGRATIONS IN YOUR APP (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Existing low-code embedded iPaaS solutions like Workato/Tray force
developers to build and maintain product integrations outside their
regular SDLC. This means no version control, code review, or
collaboration [4] for the mission-critical integrations that end-users
rely on.

Paragraph by Paragon brings the best of both worlds - providing the
benefits of an Embedded iPaaS (managed auth, SaaS API connectors,
workflow engine etc.) in a Typescript framework [4].

Integrations built in Paragraph can be synced to your git repo [5] for
version control and code review, enabling your team to ship safely and
reliably to production.
