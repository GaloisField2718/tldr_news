NEWS & TRENDS

 CHARTS OF THE WEEK: CODE GEN STRIKES BACK (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Most AI narratives break down under closer data: code-gen tools are
rebounding, job trends are mixed, early valuations don't predict much,
and data centers are scaling at extraordinary speed. The real lesson
is not to overreact to noisy data or tidy storylines. 

 GOOGLE, NVIDIA, AND OPENAI (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's TPU push threatens Nvidia's dominance, and Google's consumer
reach challenges OpenAI, though ChatGPT's large user base still gives
it a strong moat. OpenAI must adopt advertising to protect that
position and compete with Google's scale. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PRODUCT MODEL (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Stakeholders support product teams by sharing context, framing clear
problems, and enabling access to customers and data. This lets teams
quickly test and deliver solutions that drive real business results
while also managing essential operational tasks. 

 9-9-6-0 (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The AI boom may be a bubble fueled by extreme valuations and harsh
work culture, where many workers risk years of effort for equity that
could end up worthless. The real takeaway is to value people now,
because when the frenzy ends, the memories we make with each other
matter more than the outcomes.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 BEFORE YOU PICK AN AI PROTOTYPING TOOL, ANSWER ONE QUESTION (SPONSOR)
[9] 

 Most teams ask "Which tool is best?" The better question: "Which
approach gets us from idea to collaboration fastest?" Miro's AI
prototyping landscape guide [9] provides a requirement question set,
decision framework, and evaluation scorecard so you can pick the tools
that actually match your needs. Get the guide [9] 

 HOW DEEPSKY GOT ACQUIRED BY AIRTABLE JUST 4 MONTHS OUT OF STEALTH (12
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Airtable acquired DeepSky because it could turn unclear problems into
structured, trustworthy decisions, something most AI tools skip. Its
reasoning system and polished outputs paired naturally with Airtable's
workflow tools, completing the path from problem to action. 

 PMS WHO USE AI WILL REPLACE THOSE WHO DON'T (40 MINUTE VIDEO) [11] 

 Marily Nika's workflow chains AI tools together to turn ideas into
full product visions in minutes, using structured debates and rapid
“tool hopping” to find better answers. Her message is simple: PMs
who master AI will far outperform those who do not. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 UNDERSTANDING MICROMANAGEMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Micromanagement can be useful when a project is complex or demands
strong taste, but it is harmful when driven by insecurity. The key is
to communicate clearly so your involvement feels intentional and
supportive, not controlling. 

 THE AWKWARD EXIT: $150M TO $300M ACQUISITIONS (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Mid-range exits often feel great for founders but disappointing for
later investors, creating tension when a company gets acquisition
offers in the $150–$300M range. The best defense is smart
fundraising, early secondary liquidity, and clear alignment with
investors from the start.
