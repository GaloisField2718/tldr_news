 EXTERNAL DATA INGESTION AND PERMISSIONS STRATEGIES FOR RAG (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Building an AI copilot product or feature?

The RAG features you add are only as good as the data you feed into
them.

To provide real value, your product must be able to ingest and
retrieve your customers' external knowledge (ie. Their Google Drive
files, Slack messages, CRM data) for RAG.

But doing this well is difficult - you must know:

	* How to ingest all of your users' [4] external data, both existing
data and new data
 	* Chunking strategies [4] to optimize for retrieval accuracy
 	* How to model and reconcile third-party data permissions [4] in
your app

After solving these exact challenges with many enterprise AI
customers, Paragon wants to share these learnings and strategies [4]
with you.

NEWS & TRENDS

 RIP TO RPA: THE RISE OF INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 There's a significant opportunity in automating the internal
operational tasks that keep organizations running. Unlike traditional
RPA solutions, modern AI agents can more effectively automate
routine-but-essential operations work, transforming operational
headcount into intelligent automation and allowing employees to focus
on strategic work. 

 US LAWYERS WILL REPORTEDLY TRY TO FORCE GOOGLE TO SELL CHROME AND
UNBUNDLE ANDROID (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The DOJ may require Google to sell Chrome, separate Android from
Search and Play, share ad data, let websites block AI use of their
content, and ban exclusive contracts to address its illegal search
monopoly. 

 TRANSFORMATION POLITICS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Transformations to the product model requires addressing
organizational politics thoughtfully. Product leaders play a critical
role in navigating relationships, building trust, and ensuring teams
are well-prepared and competent. Success hinges on demonstrating
meaningful business outcomes early, maintaining stakeholder trust
through collaboration, and sustaining momentum with consistent updates
that emphasize real results over activities.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 BREAK FREE FROM BEING MUSHROOMED (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 "Mushroom management" (keeping people in the dark) frustrates PMs
through lack of information and exclusion. Fighting it directly isn't
effective. Instead, PMs should leverage mushroom managers' existing
strengths - like cross-functional communication and rapid
decision-making - while gradually introducing transparency through
data-driven insights, regular updates, and structured decision-making
processes. 

 WORK SHAPE MIX (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There are different "shapes" of work, for example, large projects,
independent product work, and zero-to-one efforts. Organizations
balance them as they grow, often facing challenges during transitions.
Success depends on recognizing inflection points, addressing systemic
issues before they escalate, navigating the trade-offs between
formalizing processes, and tolerating short-term friction to maintain
agility and alignment.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 UNSTRUCTURED → RESTRUCTURED → ACTIONABLE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Kolena's Restructured is AI platform that lets you turn vast amounts
of any kind of files (PDF, PPT, Docs, Video, Audio) [10] into
actionable insights. Talk to your files, and extract data into a
spreadsheet-like format. Try it for yourself. [11] 

 HOW TO GIVE A SENIOR LEADER FEEDBACK (WITHOUT GETTING FIRED) (7
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Providing feedback to senior leaders requires a careful balance of
tact, respect, and clarity to avoid defensiveness while fostering
constructive change. Strategies like using the "even more" technique,
adopting curiosity-driven language, sharing personal examples, and
supporting feedback with data can help ensure the feedback is
perceived positively and lead to actionable outcomes. 

 HOW TO WRITE A PRODUCT MANAGEMENT REPORT (17 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 While stakeholders often request "product management reports,"
there's no standard format - it's really a request to understand
product progress and impact. Rather than creating new static reports,
PMs should repurpose existing documentation like roadmaps and
dashboards, focusing on the specific insights stakeholders actually
need. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY HIRE OFFSHORE? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Offshoring provides cost savings while augmenting local teams. It can
be used to address talent shortages in the U.S. and Europe. Nearshore
hiring in similar time zones, such as Latin America, can ease
coordination. Offshore hires often have longer tenures. Better
staffing reduces burnout among local employees, improving overall
retention. 

 SOLVE "TOO MANY MEETINGS" TO INCREASE TEAM EFFECTIVENESS AND MORALE
(4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The proliferation of meetings often stems from unclear
decision-making processes, ineffective communication systems, lack of
ownership, and fear of missing out on critical information. Addressing
these root causes - by clarifying decision-making, implementing
structured updates, and assigning clear project ownership - enables
teams to reduce meeting overload and improve operational efficiency.

 HOW TO GET MORE HEADCOUNT (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Misalignment between teams and executives on headcount or roadmaps
often arises from communication gaps about problems, solutions, or
execution. 

 THINGS YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT WHEN WHITE KNUCKLING PMF (1
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 When pursuing PMF, focus on talking to users rather than perfecting
branding, design, or long-term projections.
