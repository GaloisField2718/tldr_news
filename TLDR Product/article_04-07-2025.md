NEWS & TRENDS

 WHAT WE FIGHT FOR (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Product leadership means knowing what we fight for: our users, our
teams, and the long-term health of the business. Great product leaders
bring heart and clear-eyed judgment to this complex role - championing
users, empowering teams, and shaping company decisions with integrity
and business acumen. 

 THE RISE OF THE AI-NATIVE EMPLOYEE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Lovable prioritizes AI-driven autonomy over traditional processes.
This shift has boosted productivity, removed organizational bloat, and
accelerated innovation.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 AGENCY VS AMBITION (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Not all product people have the ambition and agency needed to build
empowered teams, yet those qualities are essential for progress. 

 THE 250K PER EMPLOYEE CULTURAL KPI CAUSING LAYOFFS IN TECH (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 As SaaS competition grows, product managers must prioritize
commercial impact over vanity projects to protect their roles. By
clearly linking their work to revenue, limiting unprofitable
investments, and showcasing tangible results, PMs make themselves
indispensable.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING WITH AI AGENTS FOR MARKETING (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Hiring and managing AI agents is now a must-have skill. Companies
like Relay.app show what's possible. CEO Jacob Bank replaced a
five-person marketing team with over 40 AI agents, proving the future
belongs to those who delegate effectively to AI. 

 THE HIDDEN TAX OF BEING THE 'RELIABLE' PRODUCT MANAGER (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Reliable product managers risk burnout by habitually overextending
themselves, causing disrupted priorities and ineffective delegation.
To maintain balance, they should clarify role boundaries, pause before
reacting, and build support systems with colleagues.

 CORPOSPEAK: WHY YOU STILL SOUND LIKE A FACELESS CORPORATE ENTITY (6
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Traditional "corpospeak" marketing fails because consumers now seek
genuine interactions rather than polished, impersonal messaging.
Successful brands must empower founders and product teams to
communicate directly and authentically with customers. 

 THE PROBLEM WITH VALUE HIERARCHIES (14 MINUTE VIDEO) [11] 

 Traditional hierarchical models oversimplify strategy by suggesting
top-down execution, missing upward insights, dynamic feedback loops,
and varied time-to-impact. Effective organizations use flexible,
interconnected artifacts and rituals to better represent complex
realities across strategy, outcomes, execution, and culture.

 THE ANATOMY OF A NOTIFICATION (2 MINUTE READ) [12]

experience with four key stages: Trigger, Hook, Destination, and
Action. 

 THE NEW PRODUCT TRIO (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI-driven growth demands expanding traditional product teams
(PM/Eng/Design) to include Product Marketing and Growth, ensuring
products succeed amid rising competition.
