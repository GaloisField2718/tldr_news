NEWS & TRENDS

 5 PRINCIPLES FOR PRODUCT MANAGERS FENDING OFF OBSOLESCENCE IN THE AI
ERA (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI's rise is not eliminating ambiguity in product development but
transforming how PMs engage with it - demanding fluency in model
behavior, bold pricing strategies, and emotionally resonant,
fast-shipping products. The strongest PMs will treat models as
evolving platforms, reflexively use AI daily, and lead with intuitive,
AI-native product design. 

 “POLITICS” (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Product leaders often struggle with "politics" because they
undervalue it as a key part of executive leadership. Success requires
understanding business incentives, framing decisions in economic
terms, celebrating wins, and building cross-functional alliances.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 NICHES ARE LARGER THAN YOU'D THINK (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Success comes from focus and persistence: building for a specific
niche, sharing lived insights, and compounding trust over time.
Speaking directly to a core audience creates resonance, community, and
pricing power. 

 WHY USERS IGNORE YOUR BEST FEATURES (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Features often fail not due to poor design, but because they clash
with users' cognitive habits, making them effectively invisible.
Adoption thrives when discovery feels intuitive, playful, and
rewarding, aligning design with brain patterns, not against them.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 RIGHT-SIZING YOUR ANALYSIS TO WIN APPROVAL: THE BUSINESS CASE
SPECTRUM (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Not all business cases need to be lengthy documents; instead, they
should match the scale and risk of the investment, ranging from a
quick back-of-the-napkin estimate to a detailed full analysis. By
adopting a progressive approach - starting small and refining over
time - product teams can improve decision-making, gain stakeholder
support, and increase their organizational influence. 

 INSIDE A HIGH VELOCITY SALES-ASSISTED GTM MOTION (5 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Pylon, a B2B customer service startup, has built a high-velocity,
inbound-only sales engine that closes up to 30 deals per rep monthly,
with impressive retention metrics and no outbound SDRs. Its success
stems from founder-led growth, a strong LinkedIn-driven pipeline, and
a highly automated, trial-based sales motion that enables rapid
scaling without sacrificing customer experience.
