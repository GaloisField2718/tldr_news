 25 AI AGENT PROMPTS FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPERS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Notion just released 25 ready-to-use AI agent prompts [4] that cover
your entire product development cycle.

👉 Use these prompts to spin up agents (not chatbots!) that automate
your coordination and documentation work [4], based on all the context
you have in Notion.

FOR EXAMPLE: Brainstorm Actioner, Sprint Planning Assistant, Risk
Assessment Matrix, Feature Specification, API Documentation, Release
Notes Generator, User Feedback Synthesis, and more.

👉 Each prompt delivers structured outputs. Copy the prompt, add
your context, and get a shareable doc in Notion.

👉 Designed to reduce busywork (status updates, docs, FAQs), improve
alignment, and help teams ship faster.
