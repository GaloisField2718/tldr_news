 WHEN AI DELIVERS VARIABLE VALUE, FLAT PRICING DOESN'T WORK. (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 AI processes 50 emails for one customer and 5,000 for another.
Document tools handle 100 pages for startups and 100,000 for
enterprises. Same feature, wildly different value. Legacy billing
systems can't comprehend this. [4]

Companies that try to build modern products on outdated billing
infrastructure get stuck in endless iteration cycles. Emerging winners
like OpenAI can respond to market changes in hours instead of quarters
because their pricing systems are flexible enough to keep up with
product velocity.

NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY YOUR BRAIN IS THE BIGGEST BOTTLENECK IN AI PRODUCTIVITY (13
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 An attempt to save $20 on AI coding tools spiraled into days of
frustrating debugging, revealing how cognitive biases can sabotage AI
productivity. Clear mental models, timely investments, and bias
awareness matter more than the tools themselves. 

 INSIDE THE FASTEST-GROWING AI STARTUP IN HISTORY (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI's biggest impact is in democratizing creation, embedding itself
into all workflows, thriving on rapid tech adoption, leveraging social
media as a growth engine, and competing fiercely for top global
talent. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 ARE YOU WINNING THE PM BULLSHIT BINGO? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Win at product management by focusing on value, not busywork: lead
with context, keep backlogs lean, overestimate forecasts, remove
approval bottlenecks, and cut meetings to protect focus. 

 YOU CAN LOVE YOUR JOB AND TAKE A VACATION (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 High performers risk burnout when they avoid taking time off, even
with “unlimited vacation” policies. Sustained impact requires
planned breaks, clear delegation, and leading by example to normalize
recovery.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 DIAGNOSING YOUR COMPANY'S STRATEGY PROBLEM (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Strategy stalls when companies lack shared facts, clarity on the game
they're playing, or the will to commit to focused action. Real
progress starts with closing insight gaps, aligning on the true game,
and converging on decisive next steps despite uncertainty. 

 HOW ROWS.COM INCREASED ACTIVATION BY 30% WITH AI-POWERED FREEMIUM (8
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Rows.com grew activation by launching loginless onboarding to capture
high-intent users, designing onboarding around real jobs instead of UI
tips, and using a generous freemium model to showcase AI's value
early. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHO WILL ACTUALLY PROFIT FROM THE AI BOOM? (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Record AI investment is fueling growth, but market valuations show
investors expect competition to keep profits in check. This challenges
fears of AI creating extreme inequality concentrated among a few
dominant owners. 

 MODELBUSTERS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Modelbusters are companies that defy forecasts by either revealing
far larger TAMs than expected or launching new products that unlock
major adjacencies. They succeed by building “what” products over
“how” products, pulling in customers through love and retention,
leveraging network effects, and compounding growth far beyond
financial models.

QUICK LINKS

 WHY AI DISRUPTS SOFTWARE FIRST (2 MINUTE READ) [14]

 BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO TRUE LEARNING (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Chasing entertaining learning over essential, outcome-focused growth
prevents ambitious product people from achieving extraordinary
results.
