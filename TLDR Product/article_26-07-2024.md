 WHY HIGH GROWTH, HIGH CHURN PRODUCTS NEVER SEEM TO WORK (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 This author examines the trend of 'meme apps' ‚Äî single-use, viral
apps that capture users' attention briefly due to novelty but lack
long-term retention. He highlights the importance of solid retention

 AI-DRIVEN PRODUCT MANAGEMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [6]

management. 

 YOU'RE NOT JUST SOLVING USER PROBLEMS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article argues against dogmatically following a
"user-needs-first" approach in product development. While

 THE SECRET BEHIND STELLAR NORTH STAR METRICS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 PMs should think beyond standard KPIs when defining their North Star
metric, focusing on what won't change in the long term and questioning
industry norms for measuring success. Spotify's use of "time spent

customer engagement over typical subscriber and revenue metrics.

 HOW TO LAUNCH YOUR SECOND (OR THIRD, OR FIFTH) PRODUCT (12 MINUTE
READ) [12]

 HOW TO AVOID INTERVIEW AFTERWIT (6 MINUTE READ) [13]

 FROM IMPOSSIBLE TO INEVITABLE: CRAFTING YOUR REALITY DISTORTION FIELD
(6 MINUTE READ) [14]

created them through a powerful reality distortion field. Achieving
this mindset involves developing an unshakable belief in your idea
that makes you act as if it already exists. To build your own reality
distortion field, visualize success daily, set ambitious goals,
surround yourself with supportive believers, embrace failure, and stay
curious.
