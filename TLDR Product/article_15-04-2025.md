 THE RETENTION FRAMEWORK THAT GREW REAL PRODUCTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Social media tactics. Drip campaigns. Push notifications.

The internet is rife with “growth hacks” for increasing
retention—but these are just short-term fixes that may or may not
work for your company at a given point in time.

Instead of random tactics, you should start with a solid framework [4]
that covers the entire user lifecycle—which is exactly what you'll
find in this 90+ page ebook by Amplitude [4]:

 	* Understanding your critical event and product usage interval
 	* Building your retention lifecycle framework (plus how to choose
the right method)
 	* Analyzing new user retention, current user retention, and
resurrected user retention

 ESCAPE OKR THEATRE (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Key traits of effective OKRs include focus, measurability, realism,
cohesion, and alignment with strategy, rather than rigid cascading
structures. The framework warns against common pitfalls, such as
overloading objectives, relying solely on lagging indicators, or
setting vague and obvious goals - advocating instead for clear,
strategic OKRs that foster direction, learning, and meaningful
progress. 

 WHY YOUR USERS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Product strategy should be treated as a product itself by clearly
defining its audience, the problem it solves, and how success is
measured - focusing on enabling teams and stakeholders to make
intentional decisions. Rather than simply completing templates, the
value lies in aligning team efforts with strategic priorities and
confidently rejecting misaligned opportunities.
