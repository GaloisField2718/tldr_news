 UNIFIED INVOICING FOR EVERY REVENUE MOTION: METRONOME LAUNCH WEEK
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 WHAT'S HAPPENING: Metronome just introduced new capabilities that
bring automation and unification [4] to how companies monetize across
every GTM motion—from self-serve to enterprise to cloud
marketplaces.

WHAT'S NEW: Teams can now manage PLG invoicing, sales-led contracts,
and marketplace transactions (including GCP along with
already-supported AWS and Azure) in one system using the same rate
cards and pricing logic across all channels.

WHY IT MATTERS: When every motion runs on one monetization
infrastructure, revenue scales faster. Unified invoicing helps teams:

 	* Launch new channels without rebuilding billing infrastructure
 	* Maintain consistent pricing and revenue visibility across PLG,
SLG, and marketplace motions
 	* Eliminate manual reconciliation and duplicate billing logic

 HOW TO SHIP A MOBILE APP (AKA THE SUBMISSION GAUNTLET) (7 MINUTE

 Launching mobile apps is harder because Google and Apple require real
testing, real feedback, and real judgment. The challenge is not
building the app but navigating people, process, and product choices. 

 AI MARKETPLACES (74 MINUTE PODCAST) [11] 

 AI makes marketplaces faster, but trust and local expertise still
win. ACV Auctions proves that buyer-first trust, clean data,

 TINDER TO USE AI TO GET TO KNOW USERS, TAP INTO THEIR CAMERA ROLL
PHOTOS (12 MINUTE READ) [12]

out fresh AI tools and redesigns, the app continues to lose
subscribers in a tougher dating market.
