 NO, REALLY, EVERYTHING BECOMES BI (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI might make better business decisions than a CEO if it had access
to all of the CEO's context, memories, and data. This challenges the
idea that human judgment is inherently superior. The future of
analytics and AI may lie in capturing and integrating qualitative
human context - our thoughts, preferences, and messy intuition -
rather than merely improving data tools or charts.

 AI DESIGN TOOLS ARE MARGINALLY BETTER: STATUS UPDATE (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 AI design tools have improved since 2024, but are still far from
replacing designers, with narrow-scope tools like Figma's layer
renaming and copywriting being the most useful. Broader tools like
wireframe generators still lack the necessary contextual
understanding, and issues like short prompt limits and poor design
system integration persist.
