 THE HYPE ECONOMY (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There is a culture within some tech companies where ideas are
promoted based on salesmanship rather than critical thinking and
evidence. A shift towards evidence-guided development that emphasizes
strategic context, clear goals, research-based ideas, and product
discovery would create a healthier work culture and improve business
results. 

 SOFTWARE HAS EATEN THE MEDIA (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Both public and private markets prioritize revenue growth over
product quality or human welfare, leading to layoffs and mismanagement
in tech and media industries. Executives prioritize investor
satisfaction over user needs, resulting in the decay of creativity,
innovation, and journalistic integrity. Tech's obsession with AI
reflects a broader trend of prioritizing symbolic value creation over
genuine customer benefit, exacerbating societal issues like spam
advertising and deceptive subscription practices.

from Google-centric strategies. 

 CATEGORIES OF AI PM WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [14]
