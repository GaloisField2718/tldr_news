 THE INTEGRATIONS RACE: HOW AI PRODUCTS ARE DOMINATING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The biggest race between AI products today, is integrations.

THE RACE IS ACCELERATING:

	* ChatGPT launched Google Drive/OneDrive last year
	* Claude followed with those same integrations a few months later
	* Perplexity acquired an integration platform in Q4 to scale their
connectors even faster

Leading AI products are competing on two critical fronts:

	* CONTEXT ACCESS: Pulling knowledge directly from users' external
tools (Slack, GDrive, Notion, Zoom)
	* ACTION CAPABILITIES: Executing tasks across users' workflow (email,
CRM updates, project management)

This article [4] explores how companies like Intercom, Notion, and
You.com are leveraging integrations to build competitive moats around
their products, and how you can too.

NEWS & TRENDS

 AMERICAN DISRUPTION (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Globalization and scale have permanently shifted key production -
especially semiconductors - to Asia. Instead of blanket tariffs or
reviving low-end manufacturing, the U.S. should prioritize strategic
control of advanced technology and components, using its market power
to build a resilient, forward-looking supply chain. 

 AI AVATARS ESCAPE THE UNCANNY VALLEY (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI avatars are evolving beyond basic lip-syncing into dynamic,
expressive characters with full-body movement, emotional nuance, and
real-time interaction. As quality improves, they are transforming
content creation, marketing, and communication for consumers, SMBs,
and enterprises.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 RACI CHARTS ARE STIFLING COLLABORATION (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Relying on the RACI matrix to resolve team friction is ineffective,
as it reinforces outdated, factory-era management models that hinder
collaboration and accountability. Instead, leaders should identify
root causes - such as team structure, unclear mission, or a handoff
mentality - and apply targeted strategies or alternative frameworks to
build empowered, cohesive teams. 

 8 THINGS ABOUT PRODUCT FRAMEWORKS I WISH I KNEW EARLIER (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Frameworks in product management provide valuable guidance, but rigid
application can conflict with real-world complexities. Success comes
from adapting principles to context, fostering collaboration, and
balancing customer value with business impact.

 A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR AI AGENT PRICING (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Most AI agent founders struggle with pricing, often undervaluing
their offerings due to unclear models. This guide outlines four
effective pricing strategies - per agent, per action, per workflow,
and per outcome - and provides a decision framework to help companies
select and evolve the right model based on their agent's capabilities
and customer value perception. 

 ACCESSIBILITY. IT'S A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Accessibility isn't a solo task or a final checklist item - it's a
shared responsibility across content, UX, and development to ensure
inclusive, usable experiences for all. Teams can build better, more
innovative products that benefit everyone by collaborating early and
challenging assumptions.
