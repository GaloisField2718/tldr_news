TLDR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 2025-07-25

 PRICING IS A PRODUCT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Pricing used to be a number you wrote in a spreadsheet, negotiated
once a year with the customer, and forgot about until renewal.

This is no longer the case…

With usage-based models, AI-powered agents, and real-time
infrastructure, pricing is something your customers feel every time
they log in. Pricing is your most visible product experience [4] and
builds user trust - or destroys it with one bad experience.

This means you have to start thinking about pricing decisions like
product features [4] - with frequent iterations, experiments, and user
observations.

 PRODUCT OPS WITHOUT PERMISSION (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new CPO asking tough questions is your chance to spotlight how
product ops can drive strategic execution. Document existing ops work,

with program managers to show the value of formalizing the role
without overstepping. 

 WHY YOUR PRODUCT DECISIONS NEED DESIGN EXPERTISE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Companies mistakenly equate business expertise with design skill,
creating cluttered products that frustrate users and require excessive

 A QUICK PRODUCT SIMPLICITY TEST: REMOVE ALL THE EXPLAINERS (3 MINUTE
