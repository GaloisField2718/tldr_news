 FRAMEWORK + SCORECARD: AI PROTOTYPING FOR PRODUCT LEADERS (SPONSOR)
[4]

leaders think prototyping needs to happen earlier. Wait til late in
the lifecycle to surface changes and you'll get months of delays.

tools that create editable prototypes, not fully fleshed bad ideas. 

In this Miro guide [4], product leaders get a:

1️⃣ Question set to define requirements & priorities

2️⃣ AI prototyping landscape overview

3️⃣ Tooling evaluation framework + scorecard [4]

NEWS & TRENDS

 THE LINE BETWEEN AI-FIRST AND AI THEATER (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI-first work fails when it stops at impressive demos. Real value
comes from product ownership, clear outcomes, and responsibility once
AI touches the product. 

 WHY EVERY EXEC SHOULD BE VIBECODING (12 MINUTE READ) [6]

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 AI'S MISSING INGREDIENT (4 MINUTE READ) [7]

humans actually understand and care about. 

 MY TIME AT AMAZON, PART I (13 MINUTE READ) [8]

 LIFE OF A BIRB (7 MINUTE READ) [9]

guiding users to an early payoff, the app turns curiosity into
retention. 

 WHAT MAKES GENERATED UI WORTH KEEPING? (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI-generated UI only becomes valuable when it reflects real product
constraints. Designing with brand, data, and existing patterns from
the start turns AI output into something teams can actually build on.

context. 

 UX STRATEGIST: THE ONLY JOB WHERE SAYING ‘IT DEPENDS' IS CONSIDERED
EXPERTISE (10 MINUTE READ) [12]
