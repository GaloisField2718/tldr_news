NEWS & TRENDS

 CUSTOMIZATION DEBT (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Customization debt is a subtle but significant issue in B2B software
companies where meeting large customers' special demands for unique
features leads to long-term maintenance burdens on product and
engineering teams. These "specials" offer short-term revenue gains but
accumulate hidden costs, disrupting future development, support, and
scalability, while often going unaddressed due to pressure to close
major deals. 

 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM AN EDTECH'S ORGANIZATIONAL REDESIGN (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 After an EdTech company acquired a competitor, Jenny Wanger led a
collaborative organizational redesign to address scattered product
management roles and improve cross-functional workflows. By
consolidating roles, streamlining communication, and implementing
support structures like training and documentation, the team became
more empowered and better equipped to meet their ambitious product
launch goals.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 LEVERAGING OPINIONATED DEFAULTS TO POWER GROWTH (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 As product builders, we act as choice architects by establishing
defaults — predefined options for users. Leveraging opinionated
defaults means guiding users toward a recommended course of action,
similar to an executive summary that highlights the most important
information. While users can benefit from following these defaults,
power users have the option to explore details and customize beyond
the predefined choices. 

 HOW TO MEASURE STRATEGY? (FEATURING SPOTIFY, ZYNGA, STARBUCKS) (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Strategy, like a product, involves setting ambitions, iterating with
new learnings, and pivoting when assumptions fail. The key differences
are the larger time scale, more variables, and the need to extrapolate
KPIs. Just as with product success, strategy requires clear actions
and investments to achieve desired outcomes.

 WHAT I LEARNED FROM TRACKING 443 SAAS PRICING PAGES (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 In 2024, 188 companies (42.4% of the index) updated prices, with 42
adjusting multiple times per quarter. There were 64 price increases
(average 20%) and 38 decreases aimed at boosting market share or
product adoption. 

 THE PRACTICE IS THE PRODUCT: FROM FRAMEWORKS TO ADAPTING TO CONTEXT
(27 MINUTE VIDEO) [11] 

 In his 2024 Product at Heart talk, Tim Herbig challenged the
conventional reliance on best practices and frameworks in product
management, advocating for a mindset shift toward adapting techniques
based on specific contexts. He emphasized focusing on delivering real
value by continuously evolving and refining product strategies and
operational processes, treating them like products themselves, rather
than adhering rigidly to predefined methods that may not yield
meaningful results.

 THE SERENGETI PLAIN: FALLACIES THAT AREN'T FALLACIES (10 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 This piece rejects the common narrative that dismisses human
instincts, like loss aversion, and calls them "fallacies," arguing
that these so-called fallacies often reflect practical wisdom rather
than illogical behavior. It criticizes the overemphasis on maximizing
"expected value" and other economic principles that fail to account
for individual circumstances and the complexities of real-life
decisions, suggesting that such logic often overlooks the importance
of context and human experience. 

 ALL THE WORLD IS MADE OF TRUST (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Trust is essential for efficiency. It relies on three key factors:
shared intent for aligned outcomes, the skill to complete the task
effectively, and the necessary context or information to perform the
job well.
