AI products don’t win on models. They win on moats, differentiation,
and systems that compound value without collapsing under
cost. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌

 DISCUSSING THE NEW FORRESTER STUDY: WHY 39% OF AI DEPLOYMENTS ARE
FAILING TO DELIVER ROI (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most AI tools live in silos - ChatGPT for brainstorming, Claude for
writing, Notion for docs...

According to a new Forrester study [4], this fragmentation is the top
factor limiting returns for 39% of organizations. The study surveyed
500+ decision makers and found that the real AI opportunity isn't
individual productivity, but better collaboration.

What to these results mean for your AI initaitve? Join Forrester
analysts and the Miro product team for a live webinar on January 22
[4]. They'll introduce the study, and discuss practical ways to bridge
the AI implementation gap.
