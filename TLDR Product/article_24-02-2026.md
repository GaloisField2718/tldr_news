 AMPLITUDE AI, YOUR UNFAIR ADVANTAGE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You're probably being asked to “use AI” more, but finding real
impact is still harder than it sounds. 

That's why we're launching a new AI Analytics platform, designed to
understand how your customers actually behave and turn that
intelligence into action for your whole team. 

Join us for our launch event [4] on March 5 to learn how Agents can
10x your productivity as always-on teammates: monitoring dashboards,
analyzing behavior, and triggering action so you can deliver faster
wins.

NEWS & TRENDS

 CURSOR FOR PRODUCT MANAGERS (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cursor lets PMs execute, not just spec, but it works best with code
literacy and patience for integration issues. Real leverage comes when
AI workflows extend beyond one PM to the whole team. 

 TALKING AGENTIC AI WITH JULIEN BRUN (49 MINUTE PODCAST) [6] 

 AI agents turn conversation into action and push software costs
toward zero, making unique insight, fast decision-making, and agent
“skills” the real sources of value. Long-term abundance is
possible, but the transition, especially around jobs and alignment,
will be disruptive and must be handled carefully.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 SAAS ISN'T DEAD. BUT THE WAY YOU USED TO WIN IN B2B? THAT'S GONE (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SaaS is not dead, but the old B2B playbook of category lock-in, heavy
sales spend, and autopilot expansion is finished. AI-native companies
are winning by shipping faster, delivering clear ROI, and earning
retention through real innovation instead of switching costs. 

 THE CASE FOR HUMANS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI makes building faster and cheaper, but it cannot replace human
accountability, judgment, and community. As output becomes abundant,
lasting advantage comes from ownership, differentiation, trust, and
shared meaning, all of which remain human.

 PROTOTYPING EARLIER TO BUILD THE RIGHT THING FASTER: LESSONS FROM A
PRODUCT LEADER (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Ever wish your team could get on the same page before committing to
design? In this Miro session on March 3rd [9], Björn Ehrlinspiel,
Product Owner at LUFTHANSA'S MILES & MORE loyalty program, will share
how his team went from a two-week ideation process for an unvalidated
product design to creating validated concepts in less than a day.

 HOW OPENAI'S CODEX TEAM WORKS AND LEVERAGES AI (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Codex team is a small, autonomous group that embeds AI into every
stage of development, from planning to code review and onboarding. By
empowering full ownership and treating AI as a core teammate, they
move at startup speed while maintaining high quality and scale. 

 HOW TO DESIGN WITH AI (61 MINUTE VIDEO) [11] 

 PMs can design with AI by using structured workflows that turn ideas
into prototypes quickly, then iterating with users and stakeholders.
The key is choosing the right tools for each step and evaluating
outputs for real problem-solving, accessibility, and feasibility, not
just pretty screens.

MISCELLANEOUS

 RESEARCH IS LEADERSHIP, AND CODE CAN HELP (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Code has not been the real bottleneck in software productivity for
decades. Weak user research and fractured organizational systems are.
As AI speeds up coding, teams risk building the wrong things faster
unless they prioritize human-centered research and sustained ownership
over output. 

 HOW GOOGLE TRANSFORMED EMAIL (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Gmail won by reshaping both the economics and experience of email,
combining cheap infrastructure, contextual ads, and a fast
search-first interface to offer abundant free storage. Incumbents,
trapped by scarcity mindsets and banner-ad models, could not adapt
quickly enough to compete.
