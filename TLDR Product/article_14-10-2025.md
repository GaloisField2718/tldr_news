 84% OF PRODUCT MANAGERS FEAR THEIR PRODUCTS WILL FAIL (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your product manager friends are stressed. Really stressed. Atlassian

for those ready to meet it
 	* How AI is saving teams time — and what they _still_ can't find
time for
 	* Tips for investing in experimentation and product ops, based on
Atlassian's own product development experience.
