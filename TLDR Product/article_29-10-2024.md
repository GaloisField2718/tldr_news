 DATA-DRIVEN PRODUCT MANAGEMENT: BACKING UP WHAT YOU DO WITH EVIDENCE
(19 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Data-driven product management minimizes guesswork, enabling smarter,
evidence-based decisions through metrics, user behavior, and feedback.
While data acts as a guiding compass, balancing it with experience and
intuition ensures that you address the right problems. Combining
quantitative metrics with qualitative insights offers a holistic view,
fostering innovation, meeting customer needs, and preventing analysis
paralysis. 

 ALL MEDIA IS NOW MULTIMEDIA (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI is reshaping media, transforming voice to text, text to video, and
making single-format media obsolete. All media is now inherently
multimedia, creating tension for creators who have honed specific
crafts. While these tools broaden reach, there's a fine line between
expanding creatively and diluting expertise. 

 HOW TO PREDICT THE FUTURE OF YOUR OKRS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many OKRs lack relevance in decision-making because they fail the
"check-in-ability" test, leading to meaningless updates without
guiding progress or priority shifts. To create effective OKRs, one
should define their purpose, simulate check-in discussions, and ensure
attributes allow for measurable and actionable outcomes.

 OVERCOMING CHALLENGES IN STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT: STRATEGIES FOR
NAVIGATING HIGH-STAKES DECISIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Managing stakeholder dynamics in high-pressure situations is
challenging but essential for product managers. Successfully
navigating competing priorities, aligning teams, and managing
expectations requires a data-driven, transparent, and adaptable
approach. By turning contentious situations into collaborative
opportunities, product managers can strengthen partnerships, clarify
strategies, and drive cohesive product direction. 

 HERE'S WHY YOU SHOULD STOP OVER-APOLOGIZING AT WORK (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Over-apologizing, especially for minor issues or things beyond your
control, can hurt both confidence and career perception. Reserve
apologies for situations that truly warrant them so they are both
accepted and valued. Check your inner dialogue to see if an apology is
necessary, take responsibility without excuses, and use confident,
non-self-deprecating language.
