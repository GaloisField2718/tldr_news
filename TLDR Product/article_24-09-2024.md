 TASTE IS EATING SILICON VALLEY (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 As software becomes commoditized, taste ‚Äî encompassing design,
branding, and user experience ‚Äî has emerged as the key
differentiator for tech companies, influencing how products are
perceived and adopted. Leaders must now master cultural relevance
alongside technical innovation to succeed in this new era where taste
is as crucial as functionality. 

 FOUNDER MODE, INNOVATION, AND WHY WOMEN ARE WELL POSITIONED TO LEAD
(6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article discusses the differences between founder mode and
manager mode in leadership, arguing that while manager mode is
effective for scaling established companies, founder mode is crucial
for innovation, particularly in early-stage startups or when facing
disruptive changes like the introduction of GenAI. It also highlights
how women leaders can successfully navigate founder mode by adopting a
nurturing, collaborative approach while maintaining urgency and
decisiveness.

 HOW TO BALANCE PRODUCT DISCOVERY WITH PRODUCT DELIVERY (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Product discovery shouldn't be a separate phase or team, as that
limits continuous learning and end-to-end responsibility. Balancing
discovery with delivery leads to solutions users love, boosts business
value, improves team morale, and makes product creation enjoyable. 

 SHOULD YOUR NEW FEATURE BE FREE OR PAID? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Freemium strategies are powerful, but deciding whether new features
should be free or paid requires careful consideration. Key factors
include whether the feature drives retention, has virality, supports
paid use cases, or is a commodity, while also balancing complexity and
innovation to maintain competitiveness and brand perception. 

 WHY PLATFORM PRODUCT MANAGEMENT IS HARD! (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Platform PMs must understand both the needs of their users and their
users' end customers. This broader view enables building a platform
that solves user needs while empowering them to address their
customers' problems. By mastering this, platform teams can shift from
being reactive to proactive, anticipating needs instead of merely
responding to requests.
