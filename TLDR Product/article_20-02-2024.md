 SUBPRIME INTELLIGENCE (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Last week, Sam Altman introduced OpenAI's "Sora," a text-to-video AI
model akin to DALL-E that generates videos from text inputs. Despite
the initial hype, the videos it makes contain flaws. This raises
concerns about the limitations of generative AI models, which show a
lack of full understanding and can produce inaccurate or bizarre
results, and questions about their practical utility and economic
viability, especially in light of significant investments from tech
giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.
