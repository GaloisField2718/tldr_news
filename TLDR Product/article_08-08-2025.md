 HOW AI IS BLURRING THE LINES BETWEEN PRODUCT AND CX TEAMS (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Product-CX relationships break down due to misaligned goals and poor
communication. AI is changing this dynamic – creating new
opportunities for collaboration that smart product teams are already
capitalizing on.

Decagon's product leaders recently recorded a detailed session on this
shift [4]. In this webinar, Max Lowenthal and Bihan Jiang cover:

 	* Real examples of CX feedback driving high-impact product decisions
[4].
 	* The role of AI in aligning CX and product teams against shared
goals.
 	* How AI agents will reshape customer feedback loops.
 	* The mindset shift required from modern PMs.

PLATFORMS (5 MINUTE READ) [5]

minimal benefits for complex work, leading companies to mistakenly

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 ARE YOU PRICING FOR FEATURES, ACCESS, OR OUTCOMES? (SPONSOR) [9] 

 AI is changing the basic definitions of what software is, what it can
do, and how it delivers value. Pricing models designed around gating

Metronome blog [9]. 

 THE REWARD IS...MORE WORK (6 MINUTE READ) [10]
