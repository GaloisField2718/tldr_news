NEWS & TRENDS

 THE SECURITY PM GAP (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Security product management needs a different playbook. When products
are built for buyers instead of defenders, they work in demos but fail
during real incidents. 

 THE CHALLENGE OF SELLING CARE & FEEDING INVESTMENTS TO MONEY-SIDE
EXECUTIVES (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Care and feeding work is hard to defend because it doesn't show up as
immediate revenue. Treating R&D as a portfolio, not a feature list, is
the only reliable way to protect long-term product health.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE PRODUCT MODEL AT GOOGLE (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google's success comes from a product model that empowers teams to
solve hard problems through continuous discovery, strong technical
leadership, and outcome-driven execution. This approach has allowed
the company to scale, dominate mature markets, and adapt effectively
to major shifts like mobile and AI. 

 THE ODDS ARE AGAINST FINANCIAL SUPERAPPS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Financial superapps fail when they optimize for short-term
speculation instead of long-term trust. Products that increase churn
may look profitable early, but weaken the business over time.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 PROMPTS CAN ONLY GET YOU SO FAR (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Most companies get stuck tinkering with prompts and wonder why their
agents fail to deliver dependable results. This guide from You.com [9]
breaks down the evolution of agent management, revealing the five
stages for building a successful AI agent. 

Go beyond the prompt: get the playbook. [9]

 TWO NOTIONS OF A GOAL: TARGET STATES VS. SUCCESS METRICS (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Goals can mean either the states an agent aims for or the metrics
used to judge success. Separating these ideas clarifies key AI
alignment issues, especially how agents learn goals and why
misalignment happens. 

 THE INITIATIVE SHAPE ACTIVITY (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This exercise helps teams uncover misalignment about what an
initiative really involves. Making assumptions visible early prevents
confusion and costly execution mistakes later.

 THE TRANSLATION LAYER (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI works best as a translation layer that amplifies human judgment.
It feels dangerous when it replaces the work itself, not just the
format. 

 THE SYSTEM OF RECORD'S FRONT DOOR (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Systems of record will survive, but owning the interface matters more
than owning the data. In the AI era, the front door captures the
value.

 ORG CHARTS ARE FUNHOUSE MIRRORS BECAUSE SPAN OF INFLUENCE IS NOT
LIMITED TO SPAN OF CONTROL (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Org charts hide how influence really works. 

 ETERNAL ALEX COEFFICIENT (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Eternal Alex Coefficient measures how much a former employee
still shapes decisions years after leaving.
