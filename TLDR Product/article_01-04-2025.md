 DON'T BUILD A MEETING BOT — USE THE NYLAS NOTETAKER API TO RECORD,
TRANSCRIBE, AND ANALYZE CALLS INSTEAD (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Call recordings and transcripts are a goldmine for AI and
analytics… but you don't need to build your own shovel. Many
developers underestimate the time it takes to create reliable
notetakers that don't churn out garbled sentence fragments.

The Nylas Notetaker API [4] sends meeting bots to join Google Meet,
Microsoft Teams, and Zoom calls. You get pristine recordings,
real-time transcripts, and summarized insights [4] for that area ready
to use in your application. And it's already connected to your users'
calendars, so you have everything in one place.

Congratulations – you've just saved thousands of dev and QA hours.

 THE DEATH OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AS WE KNOW IT (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI is reshaping how teams build products, shifting from structured,

prune ruthlessly, and leverage AI as a creative partner to move faster
and smarter.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE MAGIC OF MARKETPLACES (5 MINUTE READ) [7]

transformative power.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 USAGE-BASED PRICING: FIX THE VALUE METRIC, TEST EVERYTHING ELSE
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 The value metric is the foundation of your pricing model and should
be carefully chosen and rarely changed. Everything else can and should
be tested. Learn more [9] about defining and choosing your value
metric, and other steps in transitioning from legacy pricing models to
usage-based pricing, in Metronome's proven playbook for shifting to
usage-based pricing [9]. 

 HOW TO GET YOUR SITE INTO CHATGPT (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GPT-4 Turbo pulls live web results from Bing, making Bing SEO crucial
for visibility in AI-generated search results. Optimizing for
long-tail Bing-specific keywords, implementing structured data like
FAQ schema, and creating thematic content clusters can help businesses
appear in ChatGPT responses and drive organic leads. 

 SUBSCRIPTION CHURN METRICS AND BENCHMARKS FOR OPERATORS (7 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Churn is the silent ceiling on growth, especially after achieving
product-market fit. Addressing it requires more than just high-level
metrics. Tackle first-term churn, involuntary cancellations, and weak
engagement with tailored strategies—such as activation, payment
recovery, and flexible pricing—to unlock real retention gains and
long-term value. 

 7 WINNING A/B TESTS THAT FEEL ILLEGAL TO KNOW (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A/B testing often fails because teams prioritize quantity over
strategy—89% of tests from 2020 to 2024 failed to outperform the
control. Winning tests in 2025 show that clarity beats simplicity,
action-based CTAs outperform benefit-first ones, and outdated tactics
like customer logos, strike pricing, and competitor comparisons can
actually hurt conversions.

 HOW TO BECOME AN EXPERT AT ANYTHING: 5 SCIENTIFIC STEPS TO MASTERY (8
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Becoming an expert requires more than vague motivational advice—it

deliberate, focused practice rather than mindless repetition.

feedback, and overlearning to prevent knowledge decay. Expert teams
thrive on shared mental models and clear communication.
