AI slows learning per task but meaningfully increases output. Overall
skill growth may remain intact if higher throughput offsets reduced
depth. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌

TLDR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 2026-02-03

 YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE TELLING YOU WHAT TO BUILD... BUT ARE YOU ACTUALLY
LISTENING? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Unwrap's [5] customer intelligence platform brings all your customer
feedback (surveys, reviews, support tickets, social comments, etc.)
into a single view, then uses AI + NLP to surface the most actionable
insights and deliver them straight to your inbox.

With Unwrap product teams can cut through thousands of pieces of
feedback, ensure no customer voice gets lost, and get data-backed
insights to inform their roadmaps.  

✅ Tested and trusted at scale by GitHub Copilot, Perplexity, Stripe,
DoorDash, lululemon, and Southwest Airlines.

If your team is still relying on time consuming manual processes (or
even a mix of manual work and AI), there's a much better way to
aggregate and analyze feedback.

Book a time to chat with the team about automating customer insights.

NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW DOES AI IMPACT SKILL FORMATION? (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI slows learning per task but meaningfully increases output. Overall
skill growth may remain intact if higher throughput offsets reduced
depth. 

 FORGET TECHNICAL DEBT (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Technical debt is only one contributor to cognitive load, not the
core problem itself. Improving software speed and stability requires
addressing broader organizational, process, and human drivers that
often outweigh technical debt and cause it to accumulate in the first
place.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 PARKINSON'S LAW AND AI: DOES AI MEAN...MORE WORK? (4 MINUTE READ) [9]


 AI boosts productivity, but it also expands scope and expectations,
resulting in more work rather than less. Instead of replacing workers,
AI is likely to make organizations busier than ever. 

 I HATE FISH (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most productivity systems fail because their maintenance costs exceed
their value. A deliberately hostile, minimal system that relentlessly
prunes irrelevant tasks keeps focus on work that actually matters.

 A JTBD-FIRST PATTERN FOR AGENTIC TOOL SYSTEMS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Strong agentic systems start with a clearly defined job and a small
set of task-oriented tools. Verification closes the loop, turning
one-off execution into continuous improvement. 

 LATENT SPACE ENGINEERING (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Beyond context engineering, shaping an AI's mental frame can
significantly improve results. Latent Space Engineering uses
emotional, stylistic, and motivational cues to push agents into more
effective modes of reasoning and execution.

MISCELLANEOUS

 RETHINKING SLACK (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Slack became too complex as features accumulated without a coherent
information architecture. A dedicated redesign effort restored clarity
and scalability through rapid prototyping, intensive customer testing,
and deliberate rollout planning. 

 CLOUDED JUDGEMENT 1.30.26 - SOFTWARE IS DEAD...AGAIN! (4 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 SaaS valuations are falling because AI is eroding confidence in
long-term retention and terminal value. As software becomes cheaper to
build, competition rises, and investors reprice risk across the
sector.
