Many promising products fail not because they lack value but because
they aren’t an urgent priority for buyers, leaving them in "Product

TLDR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 2025-05-06

 WHAT PRODUCT MANAGERS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT DEEPFAKES AND AI-BASED FRAUD
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Identity verification is no longer a one-and-done task. As generative
AI advances, fraudsters are leveraging deepfakes and synthetic
identities to slip through traditional onboarding flows.

This Thursday (May 8) [4], Persona is bringing together Product
Architect, Patrick Hall (former Trust & Safety expert at Uber and
DoorDash), and professor and Head of Fraud Insights, David Maimon from
SentiLink, to dissect the latest techniques bad actors are using –
from AI-based face spoofing to synthetic identities [4].

You'll learn about:

→ The latest techniques in AI-powered identity fraud.

→ Critical signals beyond visual data that most companies miss.

→ The mindset shift that helps you use signals more strategically.

→ Counter-strategies to protect your business, based on real-world
examples.

NEWS & TRENDS

 PRODUCT PURGATORY: WHEN THEY LOVE IT BUT STILL DON'T BUY (9 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Many promising products fail not because they lack value but because
they aren't an urgent priority for buyers, leaving them in "Product
Purgatory" where customers are interested but never commit. To escape
this, startups must identify and target customers who not only see the
value but also have a pressing need to act now, driven by urgency. 

 AGENTIC ECONOMIES (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI agents are reshaping markets through autonomous decision-making,
demanding new frameworks for fairness, accountability, and aligned
incentives. As these agents govern decentralized economies and
optimize tradeoffs between profit, utility, and ethics, society must
ensure transparent protocols and human-aligned values guide their
growing influence.

 UNLOCKING HIGHER CONVERSIONS: 11 CHECKOUT PAGE DESIGN TWEAKS YOU NEED
NOW (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A poorly designed checkout page is often the silent killer of
eCommerce conversions. Friction, complexity, and lack of trust drive
cart abandonment. Streamlining the flow, enabling guest checkout,
adding trust signals, optimizing for mobile, and A/B testing key
elements can dramatically boost conversions and turn browsers into
buyers. 

 HOW TO INCREASE APP USERS: STRATEGIES + TOOLS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most mobile apps lose 77% of users within 3 days - not from bad
design, but from weak acquisition, engagement, and retention systems.
Growth comes from optimizing app store visibility, referrals,
onboarding, personalization, and feedback loops that convert curious
downloads into loyal users.
