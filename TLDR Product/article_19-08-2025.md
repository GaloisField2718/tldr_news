TLDR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 2025-08-19

 YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED 8 DIFFERENT AI TOOLS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Product teams are drowning in AI subscriptions: one tool for search,
another for meeting notes, a third for research. None of them
understand your company's context, and switching between them kills
productivity.

Notion AI for Work [4] puts enterprise search, automated meeting
notes, and deep research in one workspace. It finds trustworthy
information across your Notion, automatically captures action items,
and generates detailed reports with your company's context baked in.

 A COMPLETE GUIDE TO REVERSE-ENGINEERING STRATEGY (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most teams misunderstand product strategy - it's not your mission,
goals, or roadmap, but the real choices driving behavior. By
reverse-engineering what your team actually does, you uncover your
true strategy and gain the clarity needed to align decisions, spot
opportunities, and win. 

 THE OKR PARALLEL UNIVERSE SYNDROME (4 MINUTE READ) [10]
