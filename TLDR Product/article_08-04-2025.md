NEWS & TRENDS

 TRADE, TARIFFS, AND TECH (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would cripple global supply chains and
economic output, with lasting impacts on tech and trade regardless of
the outcome. While Trump's tariffs aim to reduce reliance on China and
revive U.S. manufacturing, such top-down efforts are risky and likely
less effective than adapting within the existing global system. 

 WHAT TO DO (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Help people, take care of the world, and create valuable new things.
While helping and caring are moral duties, creating new things is
presented as a way to fulfill human potential—and even when done for
personal reasons, such creation often ends up benefiting others.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 FUTURE-READY: THRIVING IN THE AGE OF AI (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GenAI is rapidly transforming industries by automating routine tasks,
raising baseline performance, and shifting job demands toward
creativity, judgment, and real-time decision-making. While many roles
will evolve or disappear, uniquely human qualities—such as
authenticity, storytelling, and curiosity—remain irreplaceable and
essential for navigating an AI-shaped future. 

 THE FUTURE OF GROWTH & PRODUCT MANAGEMENT IN 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [8]


 In 2025, successful PMs must master outcome-driven roadmapping,
cross-functional business fluency, and AI-aware go-to-market
strategies. Success depends on tying every decision to measurable
business impact—not just shipping features.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 OFFENSIVE VS. DEFENSIVE DATA ANALYSIS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most teams use analytics reactively, scrambling only when metrics
dip, but this defensive approach limits growth. Shifting to offensive
analytics—proactively uncovering and acting on hidden
opportunities—enables sustained innovation, stronger retention, and
data-informed experimentation. 

 WHAT IS PRODUCT MANAGEMENT? (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Outsourcing core product work—such as user interviews, insight
generation, or strategy—erodes product sense and weakens innovation.
Product management isn't just facilitation, it's a craft rooted in
curiosity, synthesis, and co-creating the product alongside design and
engineering.

 AMERICAN DYNAMISM (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Startup culture is often idealized, but in reality, many companies
are built on stability and calculated risk, not reckless ambition.
During times of economic uncertainty, the personal and financial
security that makes entrepreneurship feasible often disappears, yet
some still push forward, driven by urgent problems and a sense of
purpose. 

 AI AGENTS AS 'FIRST-CLASS CITIZENS' IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 The rapid evolution of AI in software development has brought major
breakthroughs like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which
standardizes how AI agents interact with data and tools for secure,
scalable, and flexible integration. As AI agents shift from co-pilots
to key players in development, a new focus on "Agent Experience" (AEx)
is reshaping tools, platforms, and what success looks like for
developers in the AI era.

 B2B VS. B2C PRODUCT STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 While strategic fundamentals remain consistent between B2C and B2B
product management, execution differs.
