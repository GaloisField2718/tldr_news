 THE STATE OF DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [4]

International to survey 420 marketing, business, and IT leaders [4].

NEWS & TRENDS

 AI IS EATING JOURNALISM, EDUCATION, AND CREATIVES (5 MINUTE READ) [6]


 GenAI is here to stay, bringing with it both power and disruption.
Without measures to protect fields like journalism, education, and the
arts, we risk diminishing the human qualities that make them
essential. Thoughtful regulation, ethical guidelines, and a focus on
human creativity will ensure AI remains a tool for enhancement and not
used to replace people. Urgent action is needed to safeguard these
professions. 

 META'S AI ABUNDANCE (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta is well-positioned to thrive amid digital advertising challenges
and AI advancements. It could leverage generative AI to boost ad
effectiveness while enhancing margin through black-box ad delivery. In
the long term, Meta's use of generative UI and augmented reality could
redefine digital interactions, turning every digital and physical
space into potential ad space. 

 TRANSFORMATION AS A PROJECT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Adopting a prototyping or pilot team approach in transformation may
seem time-consuming, but in product development, it often accelerates
successful outcomes. Using the product model can boost your chances of
a successful transformation, helping your company achieve its goals
more efficiently. 

üöÄ 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DON'T BE EVIL (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google's delayed perception as "evil" reflected both the company's
initial benevolence and the privilege of being profitable enough to
avoid ethical compromises. Ambitious companies often need exceptional
success to maintain their ideals and, lacking this, face pressure to
compromise values for survival. Google served as an exception to the
rule. 

 PRODUCT DISCOVERY ACTIVITIES BY RISK (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This guide to product discovery outlines different activities
categorized by risk (viability, desirability, feasibility, and
usability) to help teams de-risk their product development by
identifying and testing core assumptions. Take action over waiting for
perfect data - start with customer interviews, prototyping, or data
collection. 

 GUIDE, DON'T COMMAND. (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Collaborating with a language model feels more like guiding a
creative partner than issuing commands. To foster effective output,
it's essential to provide context, discuss high-level concepts, and
create a structured process rather than dictating specifics. This
meta-approach requires thinking about prompting itself, not just
individual instructions.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 INTERESTED IN SOFTWARE-LED PAYMENTS? THIS GUIDE WILL HELP YOU SELECT
THE BEST PARTNER FOR YOUR PLATFORM. (SPONSOR) [12] 

 In an extremely competitive market, software-led payments can help
you differentiate your platform, deliver optimal experiences, and
drive customer loyalty. But success with payments hinges on one very
important piece: your payments partnership. Use this free buyer's
guide and evaluation tool to help you choose the best possible partner
for your company (or determine if it's time to make a switch).

 DOUBLE DIAMOND DESIGN PROCESS AND ITS VARIATIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [13]


 The Double Diamond model structures design into Discover, Define,
Develop, and Deliver phases, ideal for defined projects but less
flexible for evolving ones. The Triple Diamond model adds an
Implementation phase that focuses on scaling and integration for
complex needs. 

 FREEMIUM VS FREE TRIAL: WHICH IS RIGHT FOR YOU (19 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Freemium and free trials both support product-led growth, allowing
products to drive sales. Freemium works well for building long-term
engagement and gradually showcasing value, while a time-limited free
trial suits products that offer instant value and aim for quick
conversions. The choice depends on the product's nature and desired
engagement approach.

MISCELLANEOUS

 YOU HAVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE TO WRITE YOUR FIRST RECORD, AND ONLY 12
MONTHS TO WRITE YOUR SECOND (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 SaaS companies, like musicians, face intense pressure to follow a
successful debut with a second product that resonates and grows their
customer base, especially around the Series B and C stages. To avoid a
"sophomore slump," companies should expand meaningfully on their
original success, align with core users, and release at the right time
without diluting their brand, creating a second hit product that
builds trust and deepens customer relationships. 

 WHEN YOU'RE PIGEONHOLED AS ‚ÄúGREAT AT PROJECT MANAGEMENT‚Äù (9
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Project management skills are often undervalued in the workplace and
associated with junior roles, which can limit how others perceive an
individual's contributions, even if they perform strategic work. To
counteract this, employees should intentionally use strategic language
to frame their roles and highlight their broader impact, positioning
themselves beyond mere execution.
