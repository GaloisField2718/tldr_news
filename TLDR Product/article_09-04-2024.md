NEWS & TRENDS

 THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PRODUCT DICTATOR (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The trend of the "product dictator" in tech, where leaders centralize
decision-making and power, has been criticized for its inefficiency
and negative impact on team dynamics and innovation. Despite the
allure of simplicity and control, this approach could lead to
decreased productivity, wasted talent, and slower project velocity.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 ARE YOU DOING PRODUCT MANAGEMENT OR BULLSHIT MANAGEMENT? (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Companies frequently recruit seasoned product professionals with the
expectation of scaling their products yet fail to grant them
decision-making authority. Without this power, product managers
struggle to succeed. Strategies to cope with such scenarios include
shifting focus from features to outcomes, relying on data over
opinions, minimizing bridging communication, and prioritizing learning
over extensive planning. 

 WILL SEARCH BE GENERATIVE AI OR BLUE LINKS? ACTUALLY, IT‚ÄôS BOTH (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The idea that search results will offer either ten blue links or a
few AI-generated paragraphs is a misconception. The strategy for
generative AI across all major search engines, even those prioritizing
AI, is to discern user intent from queries and deliver responses in a
manner suited to the request. The future of search will integrate both
generative AI and traditional methods, not choose between them.
