 HUMANITY IN THE AGE OF AI (38 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Ethical AI design is needed to prevent reinforcing biases and echo
chambers, as seen with past digital platforms. Social media promotes
materialism and division, while AI has the potential to broaden
perspectives and provide a more accurate reflection of human
experiences. Early research shows promise in AI's ability to reduce
belief in conspiracy theories, with participants showing a lasting
decrease in such views after interacting with AI, highlighting AI's
capacity to foster more balanced worldviews. 

 BOOMER APPLE (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple has shifted from being a primarily hardware-driven company to
one increasingly focused on services, as evidenced by its pricing
strategies and growing reliance on software differentiation. Despite
holding iPhone prices steady in the face of inflation, Apple's profit
from services is nearing that of hardware, signaling a major shift in
its business model. Apple is evolving with age, moving toward
maximizing long-term growth through services rather than relying
solely on hardware innovation.

 GROWTH: THINKING IN SYSTEMS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Growth in business is fundamentally driven by systems thinking, and
it's important to understand interconnected parts rather than isolated
features. There is a difference between growth loops and habitual
loops and a need for features that align with business growth while
complementing existing user behaviors. 

 UNLOCKING MOMENTUM WITH PRODUCT STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Every strategy challenge, whether for a feature or an entire
portfolio, requires a product manager to turn ideas into action. To
tackle this, follow three steps: assess the current business situation
by reviewing market trends and competitors, evaluate the product's
performance and customer segmentation, and identify potential
opportunities. Engaging stakeholders throughout helps build momentum
for a clear direction.

traditional change management.

 THOUGHT PARTNER (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There is growing skepticism around AI's hype. While enterprise
adoption has been slow, AI's real value lies in its potential as a
thought partner, enhancing human decision-making and creativity.
Despite initial disappointment, leveraging AI for brainstorming,
feedback, and complex problem-solving can significantly improve
productivity and should not be overlooked by professionals.
