GENAI EATS WEB (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 As generative AI products consume more web content, their impact will

but they have yet to be developed.

 HOW SPACEX BUILDS PRODUCTS FOR THE UNIVERSE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SpaceX's complex aerospace systems require significant investment and
rigorous testing before reaching the market. Unlike software, where an
MVP can be quickly tested, SpaceX commits to multi-million-dollar
designs years before space testing. SpaceX follows an agile product
development approach, which consists of an iterative design process,
parallel development, frequent product iteration, embracing change,
and extensive use of simulations and virtual testing.

 FINDING POSITION-MARKET FIT (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Startups should continuously refine their product positioning and
brand in response to insights gained about their market and customers.
Key strategies include evolving the website to better define and
communicate the product's unique capabilities, addressing specific use
cases with targeted solutions, and refreshing the brand to better
align with ideal customer profiles.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TURN THE TABLES (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Each of us views situations from our own perspective, not from an
objective overview. Since only we know our true intentions, others
often misinterpret them. To address this, put the other person in
charge of the issue they're complicating. Swap roles with them. List
arguments that support their position and challenge your own. You
might not become instant friends, but you'll likely experience less
friction when you stop seeing them as an enemy. 

 DON'T FORGET ABOUT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Mental health awareness is essential in product management. Set clear
boundaries between work and personal time, take regular breaks, and
engage in hobbies outside of work. Although it can be difficult,
sometimes you must tell your boss no. Encourage your team to
prioritize mental health, offer support, and foster a culture where
discussing mental well-being is normalized.
