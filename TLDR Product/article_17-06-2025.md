NEWS & TRENDS

 BOTTLENECKS, AI, AND WHERE PRODUCT ADDS VALUE (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 If AI speeds up software development, the new bottlenecks are backlog
quality, user insight, and managing change. Product teams must focus
less on speed and more on smart prioritization, anticipating needs,
and guiding product evolution with strategic judgment. 

 DISRUPTION AND DENIAL (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Just as the Internet demanded a rethinking of product development
decades ago, AI now requires teams to evolve how they build and
deliver value. Those who resist change will fall behind as others
seize the opportunity to redefine what's possible.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY WE GET HOOKED: THE INVISIBLE THREADS BEHIND PRODUCT LOYALTY (3
MINUTE READ) [7]

 HOW OPENAI'S HEAD OF BUSINESS PRODUCTS USES CHATGPT TO SAVE TIME AT
WORK (46 MINUTE VIDEO) [8] 

 OpenAI builds products through fast, responsible iteration, fueled by
internal AI use and a culture where ideas can come from anyone. To
thrive in this AI era, employees must go beyond using tools - they
should adopt AI as a thought partner to elevate their work and
productivity.

works or what it means for user onboarding. Persona recently hosted
tech leaders from Ally Financial and KeyBank for a detailed discussion
[9] about reusable identity — including how it impacts trust,
compliance, and the balance between UX and risk. Watch the recording

 UNLOCKING THE POWER OF INTRINSIC MOTIVATION (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Companies motivate best through intrinsic drivers - when people find
meaning and satisfaction in their work. Leaders can foster this by
offering meaningful challenges, encouraging growth, recognizing
effort, and building belonging. 

 HOW (AND WHY) WE HELP (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Consulting approaches differ between giving direct solutions
(gap-focused) and encouraging teams to find their own answers through
discussion (relationship-based). Managing this tension means choosing
whether to follow your beliefs or fit organizational expectations
thoughtfully.
