 HOW TO CREATE AI EXPERIENCES THAT DON'T FEEL GENERIC (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most AI apps and agents today have the same problem: without
real-time customer context, AI struggles to identify who a user is,
what they need, or how to best respond. Poor recommendations, generic
experiences, and missed opportunities ensue.

The solution? Feeding your AI continuous context with real-time
customer intelligence.

SNOWPLOW SIGNALS transforms your customer data into real-time,
AI-ready signals that power personalized experiences, adaptive UIs,
and agentic applications.

 I ASKED 40 PRODUCT LEADERS ‘WHAT IS DISCOVERY?' HERE'S WHAT THEY
SAID (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Product discovery reduces building the wrong thing risk through

problems and business needs to confidently build desirable, viable,
and feasible products via research and experimentation.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 MORE OR LESS (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Choose one of three pricing strategies: more for more, more for less,

your business with that choice. The biggest mistake is not choosing,
which leads to confusion and an unfocused product. 

 PRODUCT IDEATION: HOW TO KEEP YOUR FEATURE IDEAS FLOWING (16 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Product ideation is a continuous, strategic process where teams
generate and refine ideas based on customer insights and business
goals, focusing on problems over solutions. Supported by techniques
and AI tools, it should be embedded in development to ensure the team
builds the right things and delivers meaningful outcomes.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW WILL AI IMPACT A/B TESTING? (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Traditional experimentation hits predictable roadblocks: manual test
ideation, dev bottlenecks, and complex statistical analysis.
Optimizely is now using AI to automate each step [11] - generating
test ideas with pre-built variations, handling implementation without
developer dependencies, and deciphering the results. Early adopters
are testing 2x faster without sacrificing accuracy or rigor. Read the
blog [11] 

 HOW BOL.COM KILLS IDEAS BASED ON DISCOVERY INSIGHTS (5 MINUTE READ)
[12]

uncooperative. They adapted their approach to fit the context,
uncovering insights that reshaped product strategies. 

 HOW TO GET PAST YOUR INNER CRITIC TO LEAD CONFIDENTLY (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 In leadership crises, first silence the blaming inner critic that
uses 'shoulds' and absolutes. Then, objectively reframe the situation

while avoiding blame for the past.

 FIVE EASY WAYS TO DECLUTTER YOUR LIFE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Scarcity fears can drive hoarding, causing clutter. Overcoming it
needs a mindset shift towards letting go. Organizing and valuing
possessions helps declutter and create space for priorities. 

 A BAG OF WORRIES (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 When your to-do list becomes overwhelming with vague, heavy tasks,
try splitting it into a clear to-do list and a "bag of worries" for
bigger, unstructured concerns. Using LLMs, you can either randomly
tackle one worry with a detailed action plan or prioritize them using
the Eisenhower Matrix - turning stress into structured, manageable
steps.
