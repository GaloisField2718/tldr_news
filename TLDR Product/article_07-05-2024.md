NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW AI APPS MAKE MONEY (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 We're at the early stages of AI app development, with many products
still striving to find product-market fit. While innovating pricing
models is challenging and often not the initial focus, most AI
products adopt a strategy that focuses on making pricing predictable
and ensuring it does not deter potential users. 

 ADJACENCY MATRIX: HOW TO EXPAND AFTER PMF (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Expansion after achieving PMF involves evaluating whether existing
channels are maximized, market saturation is approached, or
diversification is needed. Assessing adjacency, with a focus on impact
over cost, helps pinpoint viable directions, ensuring alignment with
strengths and minimizing risk.

 WRITER-BUILDER (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The emergence of "writer-builders" reflects a trend where individuals
excel in both writing and building within their domains, enhancing
innovation and cross-disciplinary understanding. Bridging creative
thinking with practical execution advocates for career fluidity and
the integration of reflective writing into professional practice. 

 THE EVOLUTION OF THE PM-DESIGNER-TECH RELATIONSHIP (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The roles of engineers, designers, and product managers are
increasingly overlapping, driven by a deeper involvement in each
other's domains and accelerated by AI. Cross-disciplinary skills and
collaborative approaches are required. Blending roles without
overstepping is key to leadership in product development. 

 WHEN NOTIFICATIONS REMIND US OF THINGS WE'D RATHER FORGET (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Notifications constantly vie for our attention, often intruding into
our daily lives. Although users can adjust their settings to control
the influx of notifications, app developers typically have little
motivation to make these options more user-friendly. Their primary
goal is to maximize user engagement with their products, which can
conflict with the desire for less disruptive notifications.

 WHAT WE GET WRONG ABOUT INFLUENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 True influence in leadership involves supporting others' goals and

fostering trust and collaboration within teams. 

 SHINY TOY SYNDROME (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Shiny Toy Syndrome, characterized by the fleeting satisfaction of new
tools or technologies, often detracts from productivity and strategic
focus. Common symptoms include frequent switching of tools and the
lure of buzzworthy features. It can be addressed by implementing
strategies such as cooling-off periods, rigorous decision-making
processes, and reflection on the actual business needs and impacts of
new implementations.
