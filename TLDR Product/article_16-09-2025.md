TLDR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 2025-09-16

 😱 84% OF PRODUCT MANAGERS FEAR THEIR PRODUCTS WILL FAIL (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Your product manager friends are stressed. Really stressed. Atlassian
surveyed 1,000+ of them - and most are convinced they're heading for
failure.

The full report [4] covers what's stressing teams out, where AI is
actually helping (and where it isn't), and how collaboration breaks
down in practice. Find out:

 	* Why pressure's higher than ever, but there's big opportunity [4]
for those ready to meet it
 	* How AI is saving teams time — and what they _still_ can't find
time for
 	* Tips for investing in experimentation and product ops, based on
Atlassian's own product development experience.
