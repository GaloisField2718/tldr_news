and easily?

 BIG IDEAS IN TECH IN 2025 (20 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Looking ahead to 2025, here are the major technological trends across
growth-stage tech, enterprise and fintech, consumer tech, and
biohealth tech. 

 ADHOCRACIES AND BUREAUCRACIES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Rapid-growth tech companies often resist formal bureaucracy, leading
to implicit constraints and inefficiencies that can escalate into
systemic challenges, while large enterprises face rigid, centralized
rules that hinder transformation. Balancing team independence with
lightweight processes and bridging functions is crucial for addressing
these dynamics, whether scaling up or de-scaling for sustainable
growth.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 YOUR B2B MARKETING WEBSITE IS AN EXTENSION OF YOUR PRODUCT, NOT JUST
A PIECE OF BRANDING COLLATERAL (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A marketing website should be treated as a core part of the product
experience, particularly for product-led growth companies, focusing on
optimizing conversions, user engagement, and integration with the
customer journey. This requires strategic planning, dedicated
resources like a website PM, and tracking metrics like acquisition
targets and conversion rates while learning from e-commerce practices
without misapplying their revenue-driven strategies. 

 BRITTLE POINTS: HOW TO MAKE COMPANIES ROBUST (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Companies fail due to "brittle points," which are vulnerabilities
that can lead to catastrophic breakdowns despite initial success, such
as over-reliance on a single platform, marketing channel, key
customer, or employee. To mitigate these risks, businesses must invest
strategically in redundancy and diversification, focusing on tackling
one brittle point at a time to gradually build resilience without
overwhelming resources.

 THE ART OF SECURING SPONSORSHIP IN YOUR WORKPLACE (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Sponsorship is a critical accelerator for career advancement, with
sponsors being senior leaders who advocate for high-visibility
opportunities and career growth. To secure a sponsor, demonstrate
strong performance, align with their goals, and build a strategic
network, while choosing wisely to ensure your sponsor's success aligns
with your career aspirations. 

 MASTERING THE ART OF PM EVALUATIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Product managers should approach their careers like they would manage
a product, applying the same principles of vision-setting, strategy,
and continuous improvement based on feedback. This mindset involves
maintaining ongoing dialogue, actively seeking and implementing
feedback, and regularly assessing growth opportunities throughout the
year.

 HOW PRODUCT TEAMS USE DECISION TREES TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 The MECE tree framework, developed by Barbara Minto, helps teams
analyze problems comprehensively and without overlap, while Metrics
Trees build on this by linking lagging and leading indicators to
identify gaps in measurement. Opportunity Solution Trees and Impact
Maps further connect metrics to actionable solutions and experiments,
enabling teams like Eventbrite's to align product goals with
strategies and measurable outcomes. 

 HOW TO STOP THE AI YOU'RE USING FROM TRAINING WITH YOUR DATA (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 While generative AI tools offer various benefits, they often use user
interactions to train their models, raising privacy concerns. Although
this practice carries ethical implications alongside issues of
copyright and environmental impact, most AI applications allow users
to opt out of having their data used for training purposes while still
maintaining their chat history.
