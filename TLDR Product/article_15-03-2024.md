 6 PRODUCT MANAGER STEREOTYPES TO AVOID (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 PM roles are often misconstrued and limited by stereotypes such as
being perceived as CEOs, strategists, facilitators, process managers,
or rainmakers. However, the ideal approach entails embodying a
"full-stack PM" mentality that encompasses leadership, collaboration,
strategic thinking, user focus, and adaptability to drive meaningful
outcomes in product development.

 FREEMIUM TO PREMIUM: HOW COMPANIES NUDGE YOU TO UPGRADE (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Nudging can effectively transition free users to premium
subscriptions. However, companies should proceed with caution,
ensuring they clearly communicate the advantages of upgrading,
customize nudges based on user activity, and honor the preferences of
their users. 

 PRODUCT OPS: NECESSARY OR NOT? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Product ops serves as an operational bridge that links product,
engineering, and customer success. However, introducing a product ops
role might merely serve as a temporary fix rather than solving any
underlying issues. Leaders should focus on identifying and addressing
the root cause of disconnection between product, engineering, and
business functions instead of relying on adding new roles for
optimization.
