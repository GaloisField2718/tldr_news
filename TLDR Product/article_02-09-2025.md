TLDR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 2025-09-02

 AI MONETIZATION PLAYBOOK (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Metronome provides billing infrastructure for OpenAI, Databricks, and
Confluent; they know a thing or two about modern pricing models.
They've collated that knowledge into the Monetization Operating Model,
[4] which offers a roadmap to sustainable and flexible pricing for the
current age of AI-driven value. Read the full whitepaper (ungated) [4]

NEWS & TRENDS

 ETHICS IN AI: THE NEW FRONTIER FOR PRODUCT MANAGERS (12 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 AI is forcing product managers to add a fourth axis - ethics -
alongside feasibility, desirability, and viability. Embedding
responsibility into discovery, roadmaps, and definitions of “done”
builds trust, prevents scandals, and creates lasting competitive
advantage. 

 THE TOP 100 GEN AI CONSUMER APPS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Gen AI consumer app ecosystem is stabilizing, with fewer
newcomers but rising traction in vibe coding and Chinese-developed
apps. ChatGPT leads, but Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity are rapidly
gaining ground.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 OPENAI'S PRODUCT LEADER SHARES 5 PHASES TO BUILD, DEPLOY, AND SCALE
YOUR AI PRODUCT STRATEGY FROM SCRATCH (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Winning AI products hinge on moats - data, distribution, trust - plus
workflow-centered differentiation and cost-aware design with
guardrails. Scale via controlled pilots, compounding feedback loops,
and leadership that institutionalizes ROI-driven experimentation. 

 THE CONTEXT LAYER (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The universal metrics layer failed not due to technical issues but
because it was unsellable without applications. AI agents may face the
same challenge: they could work best as independent specialists, but
business realities may keep them tied to apps.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 THE PRODUCT DISCOVERY METHOD THAT TAKES MINUTES, NOT MONTHS (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 PMs often face overwhelming, conflicting demands without the time for
proper discovery. Success comes from structuring problem analysis,
leveraging AI to accelerate discovery, and maintaining strategic
leadership over reactive execution. 

 NEW NEUROSCIENCE REVEALS 4 SECRETS THAT WILL MAKE YOU EMOTIONALLY
INTELLIGENT (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Emotions guide us, but they don't have to control us. Simple tools -
sensation, self-talk, time shifts, environment, and the right friends
- help restore balance. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE RISE OF COMPUTER USE AND AGENTIC COWORKERS (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Computer-using AI agents represent a major leap beyond RPA, enabling
end-to-end digital workflows across legacy and modern tools. Startups
that master contextualization and vertical specialization will define
the first wave of true agentic coworkers. 

 CHICKENS TALKING TO DUCKS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Miscommunication often arises when reassurance and support are
expressed in different “languages.” Effective leadership and
partnership require asking what support looks like and adapting
communication to meet others' needs.

QUICK LINKS

 DISCOVERY COLLABORATION IS ABOUT SKILLS, NOT TITLES (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Focus on skills: upskill what you can, outsource what you can't, and
be clear about what you drop - then lean into your team's unfair
advantages. 

 EXECUTION ISN'T JUST SPEED (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Great execution isn't speed or checklists - it's the ability to
adapt, question assumptions, and spot when progress drifts into
theater.
