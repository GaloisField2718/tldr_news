TLDR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 2026-02-13

 ENDLESS ALIGNMENT MEETINGS DON'T BUILD A SHARED REALITY BETWEEN
PRODUCT & ENGINEERING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Everybody wants better alignment. In reality, this often devolves
into tool sprawl, parallel work, and endless meetings where nothing
gets done. 

In this Planview fireside chat [4], seasoned product and engineering
executives will share how they're moving away from traditional
alignment models towards shared visibility systems. 

Topics include [4]:

 	* Strategies for establishing joint OKRs where Product and
Engineering leaders share accountability for outcomes, not just
outputs
 	* Techniques for making data-driven prioritization decisions, not
gut-feeling calls  
 	* Early warning systems for spotting risks, dependencies, and
capacity constraints

NEWS & TRENDS

 WAITING IS THE NEW INTERRUPTION (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI's variable response times fragment attention and weaken deep
thinking. Leaders should address this as a coaching challenge and help
teams manage AI wait time intentionally rather than relying on
willpower. 

 IT'S TIME TO REDESIGN HOW PRODUCT TEAMS WORK (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Autonomous AI agents can now build features directly from structured
intent, redefining how product teams work. PMs, engineers, designers,
and QA move from manual execution to orchestrating intelligent
systems.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE SISYPHEAN TRAGEDY OF PLANNING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Push-based planning fails in complex work because forecasts and
estimates are unreliable. Pull-based systems work better by grounding
plans in real capacity and actual progress rather than speculation. 

 EVERY DESIGN AGENCY IN NEW YORK CLAIMS THEY SPECIALIZE IN SAAS.
THEY'RE LYING (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many agencies claim SaaS expertise but only design marketing sites or
consumer apps, leading to costly mistakes in real B2B products. True
SaaS specialization requires deep experience with multi-tenant
systems, admin tools, and complex product workflows.

 WHEN DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT STILL FEELS WRONG AS A PRODUCT MANAGER (5
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Even when product managers do everything right, fast and fragmented
environments can overwhelm them. An environment strategy helps them
decide where to focus and how deeply to engage so they can stay
effective without burning out.
