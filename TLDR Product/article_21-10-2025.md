NEWS & TRENDS

 IS AI ADOPTION SLOWING DOWN? (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI adoption is slowing, but product stickiness is rising. As social
media becomes a last-resort business model and job seekers resist AI
résumé filters, it's clear that lasting growth still depends on
human judgment. 

 IN THE AIR (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This year's Coalesce felt like the end of an era, with the venture
capitalists - and the raw sense of possibility they embodied - now
gone. The data world has matured into stability, leaving its pioneers
to choose between the rush of invention and the calm of permanence. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 MOMENTUM IS THE ONLY MOAT (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Real moats like brand, network effects, and scale only form once a
startup gains traction, so in the early days, momentum isn't the moat
- it's the engine that builds one. 

 HOW TO BE LEGITIMATE (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Legitimacy in tech has evolved from user groups and magazine reviews
to venture capital and AI credentials. Despite new tools, true success
still depends on earning trust and demonstrating genuine expertise -
not just chasing trends.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 VIBE CODING STOPS AT THE PROTOTYPE LEVEL. THIS STARTUP IS LEADING THE
WAY ON VIBE SOLUTIONING (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Vibe coding tools are great for delivering prototypes, but not apps
that work at scale. Fresh off a $15M seed round, Rocket [9] is
pioneering _vibe solutioning_: AI that builds production-ready
frontend, backend, data flows, and more. Explore Rocket [9] to turn
your ideas or Figma designs into production apps. 

 4 STEPS TO BUILDING A PRODUCT STRATEGY (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post outlines a four-step approach to building product strategy:
gather inputs, craft strategic narratives, find leverage, and make
focused choices. Strategy isn't neat or formulaic - it's an ongoing,
messy process driven by learning, conviction, and disciplined focus. 

 THE ONE-DAY PRODUCT LOOP (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Grant Lee's team at Gamma prototypes, tests, and refines ideas within
a single day using AI tools and real user feedback. It's a model of
instant learning and iteration that shows how fast, data-driven
product development is becoming the new standard.

 THE FEASIBILITY FALLACY: WHY TEAMS STILL TRIP OVER TECHNICAL
FEASIBILITY (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Technical feasibility is the hidden backbone of great product teams.
When treated as a guide instead of a hurdle, it keeps ambition honest,
reduces rework, and turns speed into sustainable progress. 

 5 TIPS TO SUCCEED WITH STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Prioritize key players, build trust, align on shared outcomes,
involve stakeholders early, and manage conflict constructively. Done
well, these practices turn stakeholder alignment into a lasting
advantage for great product leadership.

 CRAFT IS SCARCE (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI makes it easy to build fast, but true value now lies in the 20% of
craft that turns rapid output into thoughtful, user-centered design. 

 ADVANCED TIME MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Many product leaders avoid strategic thinking out of fear or
“placebo productivity.”
