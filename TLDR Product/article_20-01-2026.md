 VIBE CODING IS ENDING. PRODUCT WORK IS BECOMING MORE STRATEGIC
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Multi-agent systems now let PMs validate ideas, ship features, and
acquire customers in minutes without deep domain expertise. [4]Instead
of using AI only for coding, you can orchestrate workflows that cut
cycle time and free up strategic thinking.

The real shift: you scale by making better decisions, not by working
longer hours

NEWS & TRENDS

 EARNING OUR KEEP (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ROI matters at the product level, not the feature level. Products
must earn roughly 5–6x their maker-team costs to justify investment,
and that simple ratio should anchor strategic conversations with CEOs.


 SOLVING PROBLEMS THE HARD WAY (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Real progress comes from the hard, human work of shaping clear lanes,
assigning ownership, and sustaining good habits over time. Frameworks
matter less than disciplined sensemaking, shared accountability, and
the willingness to adapt as reality shifts.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 YOUR PROBLEM FRAMING IS SABOTAGING YOUR STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Strategy fails when teams skip problem design and rush to solutions
measured by usage instead of value. The real moat is collaborative
problem framing, which creates a shared understanding that AI cannot
replicate. 

 SKILL GIVES YOU POWER. TASTE DECIDES HOW YOU USE IT. (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Late in a career, execution stops being the constraint, and judgment
becomes the work. Taste shifts from spotting flaws to restraining
power, serving as the only defense against incentives that reward
speed over coherence.

 DEMYSTIFYING AI AGENTS FOR MANAGERS: A PRACTICAL SETUP THAT IMPROVES
DELEGATION AND REDUCES REWORK (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 With less time and energy, a manager used AI agents to encode
expectations upfront, reducing micromanagement, rework, and the need
to hover. 

 25 THINGS I BELIEVE IN TO BUILD GREAT PRODUCTS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Great products are built by small, empowered teams that move fast,
focus relentlessly, and learn directly from users. Speed, judgment,
and a builder mindset matter far more than process, credentials, or
internal theater.

 UNCLE RICO AND THE TRAGEDY OF THE GREAT IDEA THAT GOES NOWHERE (7
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ideas are cheap; outcomes are scarce. In a crowded, AI-amplified
market, traction comes from selling concrete results and reduced risk,
not from insisting an idea should speak for itself. 

 THE ENSH*TTIFICATION OF ENSH*TTIFICATION (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Ensh*ttification isn't inevitable - it happens when incentives shift
and trust stops being protected. For Tailscale, keeping personal users
happy is not a loss leader, but the engine of enterprise growth.

QUICK LINKS

 DO LLMS ACTUALLY CHANGE THE ECONOMICS OF REBUILDING ENTERPRISE
SOFTWARE? (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 LLMs speed up code, not enterprise complexity. 

 CODING AGENTS ARE GOOD FIRST-TIME USER TESTERS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Coding agents are useful first-time user testers because they expose
where interfaces rely on hidden assumptions.
