 BUILDING AN AI AGENT, CHATBOT OR KNOWLEDGE BASE FEATURE FOR YOUR
SAAS? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Good prompts will only get you so far - your users' data is the
missing piece.¬†

The challenge? The contextual data your LLM needs (both structured and
unstructured) is spread across hundreds of applications [5] and file
storage [6] systems that your customers use.

Slack threads, Notion documents, sales emails, training videos - the
list goes on.

It's too costly to build and maintain all these integrations in-house
- that's why AI SaaS companies like Writesonic, Copy.ai, and Pryon use
Paragon as their ingestion engine [4] to pull data from 120+ SaaS
applications [5], with 70% less engineering.

NEWS & TRENDS

 ARE LLMS ABOUT TO HIT A WALL? (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Each new generation of LLMs demands vast amounts of data, computing
power, and energy, leading to concerns about the sustainability of
their scaling. As limits on resources loom, the industry must innovate
with more efficient training methods and specialized hardware to avoid
hitting developmental limits. 

 META AND REASONABLE DOUBT (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Investors are alarmed as Meta announces increased spending,

arise about the company's short to medium-term prospects, especially
regarding the clarity of revenue opportunities and the timing of
returns on investment. 

 MANAGING UP (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The deterioration of tech products, attributed to "rot economics,"
has been facilitated by a managerial class that prioritizes short-term
market gains over innovation. This reflects a broader issue of
entrusting tech's future to management consultants rather than those
involved in actual product creation, leading to disconnected
leadership and a decline in real value creation.

AI's full potential, especially in enterprise settings, where AI can
handle various aspects of a workflow.
