 5 PRACTICAL STEPS TO FUTURE PROOF YOUR CAREER IN THE AI ERA (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 In the AI era, product teams will shrink to just generalists and
top-tier specialists, making it crucial to deepen your expertise while
using AI to broaden your skills. To stay ahead, learn to manage AI
agents, act with initiative, and automate repetitive tasks so you can
focus on high-value, creative work. 

 PRODUCT ROADMAPS ARE NOT TODO LISTS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A product roadmap is not a task list or plan, but a strategic
communication tool used to share the intended future direction of a
product based on hypotheses and evolving understanding. It should
align with the product strategy, accommodate uncertainty, and be
tailored to different stakeholder audiences for effective
communication.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 PEOPLE JUDGE THE AVERAGE OF YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS, NOT THE CUMULATIVE (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 People judge you by the average quality of your accomplishments, not
the total, so listing too many weak ones can hurt your impression.
Focus on a few strong, memorable highlights and share lesser ones only
when aiming to be relatable. 

 YOU NEED A BETTER TESTING STRATEGY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A/B testing is broken. Only 10% of revenue-linked tests beat their
controls, and many teams keep copying popular but ineffective design
choices or fail to implement winning variants. Relying on outdated
"best practices" and internal pressures, especially around trends like
AI, leads companies to ignore test results, costing them conversions
and credibility.

 WHY ROMANTICIZING PLG IS DANGEROUS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While product-led growth can be a powerful engine for early traction
and cost-efficient scaling, relying on it alone can limit revenue
potential, reduce customer insight, and hinder enterprise expansion.
Even the most celebrated PLG companies eventually invest heavily in
sales teams to close complex, high-value deals, proving that the most
effective growth strategy is a blend of self-serve and people-led
sales. 

 WHY SPOTIFY'S UI & UX WILL NEVER BE DEFEATED (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Spotify's dominance in music apps comes from a flawlessly intuitive
UI and UX that prioritizes simplicity, minimal friction, and
user-centric features like clean navigation, seamless device
switching, and smart recommendations. Instead of adding flashy extras,
Spotify refines what matters, creating an experience so natural it
becomes invisible.

 HOW CONFIDENCE IS SELF-FULFILLING IN HIGH-STAKES CONVERSATIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Confidence significantly impacts how ideas are received by senior
executives, even when the data and people remain the same. Confident
presentation fosters trust, while nervousness invites doubt. To show
up confidently, prepare thoroughly - not just the content, but also
the audience, structure, and support - while also managing your
mindset and energy before the meeting. 

 PRODUCT IN PRACTICE: EVALUATING IF A NEW API IS NEEDED (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Building a new API product from scratch presents the same 0-to-1
challenges as any product, requiring discovery, user insight, and
thoughtful design. Chi Phan, a product manager, used tactics like
interviews and story mapping to create an API that streamlined manual
processes, boosted efficiency, and increased revenue despite initial
adoption hurdles.

 STOP SHIPPING FEATURES. START DELIVERING IMPACT (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Many product teams mistake activity for impact, focusing on features
delivered instead of meaningful outcomes. 

 RETURN TO PRODUCT FUNDAMENTALS (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 As product development grows increasingly superficial and templated,
there will be a renewed demand for teaching fundamental product
management principles - rooted in psychology, prioritization, and
intentionality - as a key differentiator in a saturated market.
