 THE MONETIZATION OPERATING MODEL: THE NEW PRICING AND BILLING
PLAYBOOK FOR THE AI ERA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 With AI, software has gone from packaged tools to embedded
intelligence that performs work, rather than just supports it.
Companies that still compete on features and charge for seats need a
new plan - fast.

Metronome's new and highly anticipated whitepaper [4]offers a
practical framework for navigating this shift, based on their work
with modern leaders including OpenAI, Databricks, and NVIDIA. It
tackles hard questions such as:

 	* Understanding what you're actually metering (agent invocations,
tokens, etc.)
 	* The infrastructure needed to support value-based pricing
 	* What outcome-based pricing actually means

This operating model [4] is a must-read for anyone grappling with
pricing in 2025. Grab your free copy [4]
