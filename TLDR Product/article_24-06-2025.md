 TRACKING USER FRUSTRATION AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL: WHAT WE LEARNED FROM
90 BILLION WEB SESSIONS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 40% of sessions still show signs of user frustration, from UI dead

conversion by up to 13.1%.

Contentsquare's 2025 Digital Experience Benchmarks looks at data from
90 billion sessions across 6,000 websites [4] and reveals:

 	* Where friction appears in typical user journeys
 	* How to trace poor user experience to root causes
 	* How product teams at leading brands are improving removing
blockers and improving conversion rates.

NEWS & TRENDS

 BECOMING THE PRODUCT MANAGER THEY ALWAYS DREAMED OF (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The unrealistic “do it all” product manager ideal may become more
attainable thanks to AI, which speeds up tasks like research,
prototyping, and analysis. With the right support from product ops, AI
can help PMs work faster and more effectively, though human skills
like strategy and team-building remain essential. 

 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AI COMES FOR OUR FONTS? (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI might revolutionize typography by dynamically adapting text to
readers' emotions, gaze, or environment, though real-world
applications remain speculative. While AI can streamline repetitive
tasks, designers warn against overvaluing generative tools, stressing
that creativity is inherently human, thoughtful, and nuanced.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE AI-PRODUCTIVITY GAP: TALENT IS THE BIGGEST FACTOR LIMITING GLOBAL
GDP GROWTH (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI is progressing fast, but economic growth lags behind because human
adaptability can't keep up. The real challenge isn't the technology -
it's finding and training people who can use it well. 

 LET'S TALK DUAL TRACK: CONTINUOUS DISCOVERY AND DELIVERY (7 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Continuous discovery and delivery require rapid iterations, breaking
large problems into smaller manageable pieces, and balancing
confidence over perfection. Effective product teams separate discovery
opportunities from delivery tasks, using quick feedback loops to
refine solutions incrementally.

 THE PRODUCT MANAGEMENT PROBLEM STATEMENT: HOW TO GET IT RIGHT (12
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A product management problem statement is a clear, user-focused
summary of a specific issue faced by target users. It guides strategy,
priorities, and team alignment by defining who has the problem, in
what context, and its impact - and should be updated as user needs
change. 

 TAKE 3 MINUTES TO DELETE THESE WORDS AND IMPROVE YOUR WRITING FOREVER
(5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Strategic language enhances communication effectiveness by removing
weak or negative phrasing such as "fine," "unfortunately," and double

READ) [13]
