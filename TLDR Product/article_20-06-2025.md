TLDR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 2025-06-20

 WHY PRODUCT TEAMS STILL AREN'T SHIPPING FAST ENOUGH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You've heard "done is better than perfect". You're pressured to
condense cycles to weeks. But when it's time to launch, you still keep
iterating for perfection.

The root cause: product teams internalize a false choice between speed
and quality [4].

In reality, opting for speed _is_ opting for quality. Fast shipping
connects teams to real-user feedback and builds organizational muscle.

In this playbook [4], Statsig's product leaders share how to reframe
speed versus quality by:

 	* Deploying features to small segments for safe validation
 	* Building kill switches for instant course correction
 	* Creating feedback loops that accelerate learning
