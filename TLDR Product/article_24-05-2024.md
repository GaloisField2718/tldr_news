MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Significant increases in VC and investments highlight the disruptive
potential of deep tech industries that utilize advanced technologies
such as AI and quantum computing. This surge presents unique
challenges, as PMs must develop strategies without established markets

frameworks to manage long development cycles and predict future needs.

showcasing the importance of allowing new initiatives to develop
independently before integrating them with traditional business
models.

 LEARNING FROM CUSTOMERS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Our customers aren't designers, and it's not their job to provide
perfect solutions. Product managers should identify deeper, often

surface symptoms. By adopting customer-centric practices, you can
uncover unique insights, validate your riskiest assumptions, and
create experiences that both satisfy and delight customers.

profitability.
