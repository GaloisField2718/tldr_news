 YOUR CAREER IS A STARTUP: BUILDING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH, ONE STAGE AT A
TIME (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Careers often focus too much on titles instead of meaningful growth,
similar to startups that raise funding too early. You can build a
sustainable career without rushing to leadership roles or sacrificing
long-term success by applying structured growth principles from
startups, such as mastering each stage, identifying your niche,
aligning with the right opportunities, and evolving strategically.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY YOU NEED A 'NOT DOING' LIST, NOT A TODO LIST (15 MINUTE READ) [9]


 A reductive approach is important to product and business growth.
Removing features, products, or tasks often provides more value than
adding new ones. Focus on core strengths, reducing complexity, and
leveraging long-term, high-impact efforts over chasing immediate
gains. 

 IS GROWTH STILL GOOD? (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The rapid adoption of AI technology, driven by fear of falling
behind, is reshaping industries like customer experience in airlines,
with startups scaling revenue at unprecedented speeds while
established players struggle to keep up. However, this acceleration
also exposes many AI companies to risks, as fast growth and shallow
moats leave them vulnerable to competition and market volatility,
challenging the sustainability of this boom.

 THE REFACTORING GUIDE FOR PMS TIRED OF ENDLESS TECH DISCUSSIONS (7
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Refactoring enhances code quality while maintaining functionality,
but PMs face challenges like shifting timelines, unexpected breakages,
and justifying the effort to management. It's crucial to balance
learning-focused development with scalable builds. Refactoring
requires preparation to avoid side effects. Rewriting is necessary if
the code is outdated or overly complex. 

 CHOOSE CUSTOMER LOYALTY OVER SHORT-TERM PROFIT (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Prioritizing user loyalty over short-term profits fosters trust,
retention, and sustainable growth. Transparent practices, thoughtful
user experiences, and loyalty rewards drive long-term profitability.
Avoid deceptive patterns, aggressive upselling, and unnecessary
changes to maintain user trust.

 “STEALTH MODE” AND OTHER F'ING BRILLIANT STRATEGIES (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Staying in stealth mode, avoiding customer feedback, overvaluing
perfection, copying competitors, and chasing everyone as a market
segment are ineffective and flawed strategies. Success isn't
guaranteed by coding expertise, minimal effort, or raising funds
preemptively while ignoring foundational business principles like
customer discovery, focus, and differentiation. 

 SAMPLE, SAMPLE, SAMPLE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Create unforgettable first impressions by showcasing your product's
unique value, engaging early adopters as ambassadors, and fostering
feedback to refine and evolve. Amplify impact through compelling
storytelling and nurture a community that sustains advocacy. Effective
sampling creates meaningful experiences, builds relationships, and
transforms users into loyal champions for growth.
