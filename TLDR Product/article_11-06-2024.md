 APPLE INTELLIGENCE IS RIGHT ON TIME (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's WWDC keynote unveiled extensive generative AI features
branded as "Apple Intelligence" and a significant partnership with
OpenAI. Despite the excitement around these AI advancements, Apple's
careful and integrated approach ensures it remains competitive in the
evolving tech landscape, leveraging its strengths in device-making and
ecosystem control. 

 WHY PRICING AND PACKAGING MATTERS MORE WHEN LAUNCHING YOUR SECOND

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 GROWTH OR PROFITABILITY? (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There is often a trade-off between growth and profitability, with
their relative importance varying over time. A balanced approach is
typically best. When growth slows below 50% year-on-year, focus on
achieving breakeven or profitability. 

 HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR VOLUNTARY CHURN (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To reduce churn in subscription businesses, understand the reasons
behind customer cancellations and monitor their timing. Provide an
easy option to reactivate auto-renewal, utilize discounts, and offer
the option to pause subscriptions. Point out what users will lose if
they downgrade from a paid subscription. 

 HOW TO FIX THE DOUBLE DIAMOND OF DESIGN THINKING (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Double Diamond model, a visual for design thinking, lacks
iterative feedback loops and ends prematurely with product launch.
Redefining phases to ‚ÄúExplore, Ideate, Test‚Äù and incorporating
continuous discovery alongside delivery resolves these gaps for
effective product management.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 PROJECT VS PRODUCT FUNDING (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Funding software as a product rather than a project is more effective
and cost-efficient in the long run. Product-based funding ensures
continuous updates, user engagement, and avoids the pitfalls of the
outdated project model commonly used in government. 

 HOW TO SPOT GOOD CASE STUDIES (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Understanding products and markets through effective case studies
enhances decision-making for product leaders. Good case studies
provide detailed context about user needs, industry dynamics, product
development, and internal factors, while poor ones can mislead if
overly simplistic or biased. Avoid sources that lack depth or are
entertainment-focused.

 COGNITIVE BIASES YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 We consider ourselves logical, but our choices are often less
rational than we think. Context, fallacies, and personal experiences
influence our decisions subconsciously. Complete objectivity may be
unattainable, but recognizing these cognitive errors can help. 

 CHATGPT TRANSFORMED MY BACKYARD (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The effectiveness of AI tools depends on the quality of your prompts.
By thinking outside the box and trying various prompts, you can
uncover innovative solutions and enhance your projects. Instead of
sticking to predefined searches, experiment and find the optimal
approach for your needs.
