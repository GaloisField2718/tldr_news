 LESSONS FROM LOVABLE: PRICING FOR AI (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Traditional SaaS pricing models weren't built for AI. Costs are
unpredictable, value is harder to measure, and the old playbooks don't
apply.

In this Metronome webinar [4], Elena Verna, Head of Growth at Lovable,
shares how her team is tackling one of the toughest open questions in
software. In this open and frank conversation, she'll share her
lessons on:

 	* Why AI has broken the logic of SaaS pricing
 	* How Lovable balances self-serve and enterprise monetization
 	* The shift from usage-based pricing toward outcomes-based models
 	* What companies can do today [4] to prepare for where AI
monetization is heading

NEWS & TRENDS

 WHAT'S THE FUTURE OF PMS? (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The surge of AI hype and tool obsession is pushing PMs toward quick
fixes and away from the fundamentals that matter. Strong product work
still depends on clear thinking, strategy, alignment, and deep problem
understanding. AI should support those efforts instead of replacing
them. 

 GOING TO MARKET WHEN NO MARKET EXISTS (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In a new market, technology means nothing until a strong go-to-market
motion gives it value. Anchor pricing high, use direct sales, refine
your story, and avoid shortcuts that kill your long-term market.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 UNCONVENTIONAL ADVICE: STOP READING PRODUCT BOOKS (7 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Product books stop being useful once you reach a senior level. Growth
comes from studying adjacent fields that challenge your thinking. 

 THE PLANNING PARADOX: WHY YOUR PLANS ARE USELESS, BUT PLANNING ISN'T
(10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Plans fall apart fast. Planning together gives teams the shared
language, decision points, and honest conversations they need to adapt
when priorities shift. The teams that ship are the ones that treat
planning as a way to build clarity and alignment, not as an attempt to
predict the future.
