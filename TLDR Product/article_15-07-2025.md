NEWS & TRENDS

 A SURPRISING PANDEMIC SIDE EFFECT: THE RISE OF PRODUCT OPERATIONS (7
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Product operations surged post-2020 as remote work, shifting PM
roles, and tool sprawl created urgent operational gaps. By formalizing
communication and support systems, product ops became vital to helping
product teams thrive in a distributed world. 

 SAAS 2.0 (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Salesforce is more than lists - it encodes expert sales processes.
However, AI agents that act like experts may soon replace these tools,
managing tasks with care so we can focus on what matters.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE WICKED "BIG PICTURE" LOOP (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A recurring business cycle sees executives request a simplified view,
leading teams to filter out critical details, which eventually creates
a crisis that forces a return to reality. Breaking this loop requires
leaders to embrace accountability and consistently face the complete,
unfiltered truth. 

 HOW TO DELEGATE WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Delegating effectively is challenging because managers are
responsible for their team's output. To succeed, they should view
delegation as a spectrum, tailoring their involvement based on an
individual's "task-relevant maturity" and avoiding the temptation to
"hide" behind familiar work or fully own projects.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION: THE DEFINITIVE LIST OF EVERYTHING YOU NEED (18
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Product documentation is a critical but often unsung part of a
Product Manager's job, serving as a single source of truth to ensure
clarity and efficiency for all teams. This article provides a
comprehensive list of documentation needed throughout the entire
product lifecycle, from initial strategy to post-launch support. 

 HOW TO GAIN MORE WILLPOWER AND RECOGNIZE YOUR BIGGEST LEADERSHIP
GROWTH AREAS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Many leaders carry unaccepted, suppressed emotions from their past,
which creates a mental strain that drains precious willpower. By
facing these emotions through a process of holding, questioning, and
releasing them, leaders can free up mental space and discover new
sources of wisdom and inner strength.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ABUNDANCE VS SCARCITY MINDSET (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The abundance mindset is a philosophy that focuses on creating
win-wins and seeing possibilities rather than being limited by a
zero-sum view. This approach rejects a scarcity mindset that guards
resources and instead focuses on lifting others up, which can create
compounding benefits for everyone involved. 

 BUILD, SELL, UNDERSTAND (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 All roles center on building, selling, or understanding - and each
comes with rewards and challenges. As AI automates more of the first
two, the value of deep thinking and insight will only rise.
