 HOW POSTMAN AND AI21 SHIP AI INTEGRATIONS 10X FASTER (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Great AI products don't work in isolation - they operate across a
user's entire workflow.

Essential features include:

	* Context retrieval from Google Drive, Notion, Slack (with
permissions for RAG)
	* Cross-app automations for emails, tickets, CRM updates

Leading AI companies choose Paragon to accelerate their product
roadmaps. With ACTIONKIT [5] for agent tools and MANAGED SYNC [6] for
data ingestion and access control, developers skip the complexity of
building integrations in-house.

NEWS & TRENDS

 YOUR USERS AREN'T HUMAN ANYMORE; START BUILDING FOR AGENTS TODAY (12
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Software is shifting from human operators to AI agents, making Agent
Experience more important than traditional User Experience. Metrics,
pricing, and product design must move from seat-based human logins to
programmatic, agent-driven integration. 

 HOW TO FIND YOUR “ONE METRIC TO RULE THEM ALL” (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Early-stage startups should choose one defining metric that proves
the business is working and focus the entire company on growing it.
Relentless discipline around that number prevents distraction and
increases the odds of reaching product-market fit. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHAT DO ENGINEERS MEAN WHEN WE SAY "TASTE"? (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Engineering taste is the ability to calibrate product, system, and
quality decisions based on a deep understanding of what is possible.
As AI automates coding, this judgment becomes the key differentiator
of great engineers, even though it is rarely taught or formalized. 

 FRANCHISE THINKING AS A BUILDER (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Product builders should think like franchisors by building systems
that enable others to deliver value consistently. Real scale comes
from clear processes, focused pilots, and disciplined growth rather
than individual effort.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 DON'T LOSE HALF OF YOUR CUSTOMERS TO CHURN (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Even a low monthly churn rate of 5% means losing 46% of customers
annually. But, not all is lost. Churnkey helps companies like
Superhuman, Gamma, and Veed reduce both voluntary and involuntary
churn. Take action with the free Churn Metrics [12] product. Also read
our Stripe benchmarks report [13] for tactical advice. 

 MOATS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 As AI makes software easier to clone, durable advantages will come
from non-code moats such as scale, proprietary data, and trust.
Long-term value depends on what you uniquely know and who relies on
you, not just how fast you ship. 

 CLAUDE CODE + ANALYTICS = VIBE PMING (53 MINUTE VIDEO) [15] 

 Vibe PMing connects AI agents to analytics and workflow tools so PMs
can describe problems while agents analyze data, draft specs, and
route work. This shifts the PM role from manual coordination to
higher-level thinking and decision-making. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 YOUR SYSTEM IS FINE. YOUR USERS AREN'T (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Technical SLOs show whether systems are running, but business SLOs
show whether users are getting value. Teams should define and measure
outcome-based metrics that reflect real user success. 

 YOUR PRODUCT IS NO LONGER THE CENTER OF GRAVITY (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI-native B2B companies are shifting from standardized products to
systems tailored to each customer's workflow. Scale now comes from
quickly modeling and encoding real business structures instead of
imposing shared abstractions.

 GREAT PMS ELIMINATE FEATURES (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Great product managers eliminate features that do not solve real
problems. 

 TALKING UP TO THE USER (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Product teams often treat users as metrics instead of capable people.
