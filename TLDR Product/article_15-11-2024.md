 HOW TO BALANCE RISK MANAGEMENT WITH PRODUCT CONVERSION THROUGH
PROGRESSIVE RISK SEGMENTATION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 As fraudsters grow increasingly sophisticated, product leaders need
to invest in stronger identity verification processes throughout the
user experience. It's a fine balance to strike: excessive caution _can
_cause UX friction, yet overly relaxed onboarding opens the door to
mounting fraud.

This is where progressive risk segmentation comes in. Read Persona's
latest whitepaper [4] to learn how to modify the UX according to
interaction context and signals received during onboarding. Explore
how to assess risk, define risk segments, and configure your identity
verification processes to protect your business while creating a
seamless user experience.

experience, and synthesizing diverse inputs to make balanced,

 WINNING HEARTS AND MINDS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A successful product transformation relies on the product
organization building trust with the rest of the company. It requires
a strong product team guided by knowledgeable leaders who prioritize
coaching, understand the business, and balance customer needs with
business constraints. Product teams must consistently deliver on
commitments, produce meaningful business outcomes, and respond
effectively to customer issues while also maintaining essential
operations. This collectively earns stakeholders' trust over time.

 THE ART OF WORKPLACE FINESSE (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Finesse is a skill that helps navigate complex interpersonal dynamics
effectively. It involves balancing assertiveness with diplomacy,
managing perception, understanding personal strengths, adapting
flexibly to situations, being discreet, and recognizing incentives as
crucial drivers of behavior. Finesse is aimed at amplifying one's
impact without rigid adherence to set rules. 

 REDUCING COMPLEXITY (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Complexity in product work is inevitable due to the inherently
adaptive and collaborative nature of such work. Instead of reducing
complexity, leaders should focus on minimizing structural friction,
setting boundaries, and creating environments that allow teams to
manage their internal complexity efficiently, rather than attributing
complexity to team failings or adding pressure that obscures real
challenges.

 Common sources of waste in product management include broken team
structures, excessive processes, over-documentation, meeting overload,
analysis paralysis, lack of tools, constant context switching, no
product discovery, compromised quality, and perfectionism. To tackle
these, pick one area, set clear goals, involve the team, take action,
and refine as needed. Few things are as frustrating as wasted team
effort.

car controls.
