NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY EXPLAINABILITY IS THE FIRST REAL TEST OF CONTEXT ENGINEERING (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI judges your product before customers do. Strong product
explainability helps AI represent your product accurately, turning
context engineering into a real PM advantage. 

 SOMETIMES, YOU SHOULD TALK TO FEWER CUSTOMERS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Corporate rituals raise the floor, not the ceiling. Top PMs create
impact by minimizing opportunity cost and prioritizing deep thinking
over busywork. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE 90% PROBLEM: WHY OTHERS' AIS' DESIGNS MAY BECOME YOUR PROBLEM (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI can get designs 90% of the way there, but designers make them
right. The future of design is not drawing first, but explaining why
the final solution works. 

 OBSERVATIONS OF LEADERSHIP (PART TWO) (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Leadership at scale is less about control and more about timing,
curiosity, and navigating complexity. Real progress comes from
understanding systems, embracing friction, and updating mental models
when conditions are right.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 WHAT'S HOLDING BACK 75% OF AI PROJECTS? DATA FROM 500 DEPLOYMENTS
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Most AI tools are built for solo work. New Forrester research [11]
shows that's exactly why AI rollouts are stalling - teams need AI that
helps them work together, rather than solo. Miro is hosting Forrester
analyst J.P. Gownder on January 22 to break down the data from 500+ AI
deployments. Register now [11] 

 THE GROWTH META: HOW TO BUILD A WAITLIST (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Waitlists no longer signal hype. The best ones qualify intent,
activate fast, and prove who will actually pay. 

 CHARGING FOR ADVICE MADE MORE PEOPLE ASK, NOT FEWER (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Charging for advice increases demand by removing social friction.
Price and async access signal openness, making it easier to ask for
and give help. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE TEXT BOX ISN'T ENOUGH (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI text boxes are powerful, but not enough. Like GUIs did for PCs,
better interfaces will unlock AI's real potential for everyone. 

 THE COLD START PROBLEM (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Network-effect products fail when they launch without density. Start
with one small, self-sustaining network, then repeat and scale.
