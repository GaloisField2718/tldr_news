NEWS & TRENDS

 TOWARD A WORKING DEFINITION OF PAPERCLIP-PUNK (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Paperclip-punk, a new AI-era aesthetic, is marked by clean,
interactive, blueprint-like web design that reflects growing machine
agency. It represents a shift toward interfaces that teach and
respond. While defining it gives the movement clarity, it may also
make it easier for AI to replicate and absorb. 

 AI, NETWORKS, AND MECHANICAL TURKS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LLMs let companies borrow intent-level understanding instead of
building it, changing how recommendation and discovery systems start,
scale, and shape what people see. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 STOP TALKING ABOUT YOUR IMPACT. START SPOTLIGHTING THEIRS (10 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Recognizing others is the most authentic form of self-advocacy. You
elevate everyone, including yourself, when you share specific wins,
link them to strategy, and run internal launches that spotlight team
contributions. 

 WHY GREAT EXECUTIVES MUST STILL DO THE WORK (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Leaders who stop doing the work lose the sharpness that made them
leaders in the first place. In the AI era, staying hands-on is a
competitive advantage.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO CREATE A GREAT DIGITAL ONBOARDING EXPERIENCE, EVEN IN HIGHLY
REGULATED INDUSTRIES (SPONSOR) [10]

more user-friendly is always going to be a competitive advantage. This
guide by Persona [10] explains how you can use passive, risk-based
signals to determine which types of verifications to employ, reduce
onboarding friction, and increase conversion rates. Get your copy now

 THE STATE OF AI (54 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 LLMs are used across many tasks, with open models gaining ground and
programming and roleplay leading demand. Capabilities, not price,
drive adoption. Breakthrough models often form uniquely loyal early
user groups. 

 HOW TO ASK FOR SUPPORT FROM SENIOR LEADERS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Senior leaders' offers to help are genuine, and asking for support is
a core leadership skill. Knowing when to ask and what type of help you
need can speed up decisions, strengthen alignment, and raise your
profile. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO PRODUCT MANAGEMENT ANYWAY? (12 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 AI-native companies need fewer PMs, but the PMs who stay will be
closer to the product, move faster, and operate with stronger
technical and alignment skills. The winners will be builders who ship
quickly, guide teams through ambiguity, and adapt to a new pace of
work. 

 WHY LOCAL TECH SCENES HAVE CHANGED (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI reshuffled local tech. Top talent either move to SF or build solo,
leaving local scenes as communities of independent creators rather
than traditional startup pipelines.
