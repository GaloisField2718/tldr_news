 🧪 EXPERIMENT FASTER AND FAIL SMARTER - A LIVE WORKSHOP WITH RONNY
KOHAVI (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your best ideas might not be the right ones. Are you relying on
half-baked hunches, or cold hard data?

Join best-selling author RONNY KOHAVI (former executive at Amazon,
Microsoft, Airbnb) and an Amplitude Principal PM for a can't-miss
session [4] on building an experimentation culture.

Here's what you'll learn ↘️

 	* Why 70-90% of product assumptions fail [4] (and why that's OK)
 	* How experimenting can help you shorten time-to-value
 	* A smarter way to test, learn, and improve the user journey

Join live to ask Ronny your product experimentation questions [4]

NEWS & TRENDS

 TEAM AUTONOMY AND AI (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Empowerment lets product teams determine the best solution to a
problem, while autonomy enables them to execute it independently -
both are essential but often mismatched. New AI tools promise to
reduce dependencies, boost autonomy, and transform how teams manage
legacy systems and technical debt. 

 SSEBITDA – A STEADY-STATE PROFIT METRIC FOR SAAS COMPANIES (9
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 When a business is "spending to grow," it can assess its true
profitability using SSEBITDA, which reflects profit assuming only
enough spending to maintain its current size. Unlike older models like
EBITDASM, SSEBITDA accounts for customer churn and acquisition
efficiency, helping businesses differentiate between sustainable
growth and a flawed business model.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WAITING FOR THE PRODUCT MANAGEMENT OMBUDSMAN? YOU MIGHT BE WAITING A
LONG TIME! (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Product managers often struggle for recognition due to leadership's
lack of understanding and the absence of industry-wide standards. Real
change comes from aligning with business goals, proving impact, and
driving transformation one company at a time. 

 UX VS. CRO: HOW HARMONIZING DESIGN AND STRATEGY CAN SKYROCKET YOUR
ECOMMERCE REVENUE (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 UX and Conversion Rate Optimization are complementary forces in
eCommerce - UX creates seamless, user-friendly experiences, while CRO
transforms those experiences into measurable actions like purchases or
sign-ups. Integrating both strategies leads to higher conversion
rates, greater user satisfaction, and increased revenue.

 PRODUCT MANAGER SALARY BENCHMARKS 2025: 30+ COUNTRIES, 100+ CITIES (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Here is an interactive set of dashboards that aggregates PM salary
data across different geographic regions. 

 THE "$0 WITH A TWIST" STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Domino's tattoo-for-pizza stunt highlights the power of “$0 with a
Twist,” where people earn free stuff through quirky challenges that
are memorable, shareable, and brand-aligned. This strategy taps into
the IKEA effect, generating viral buzz and engagement with minimal
spend. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE HUMBLE SCREENSHOT MIGHT BE THE KEY TO GREAT AI ASSISTANTS (6
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Screenshots act as a personal signal of importance, offering a simple
yet powerful way to train AI systems with relevant, user-selected
data. As AI tools evolve, they're turning these casual captures into
actionable, personalized experiences - redefining screenshots as a key
input for agentic computing. 

 STARTUPS (STILL) AREN'T BUSINESSES (YET?) (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Silicon Valley operates under two unspoken laws: overwhelming compute
beats clever logic, and startups are designed not to make consistent
profits, but to generate massive one-time paydays through exits.
Despite recent trends of lean, profitable AI startups, the core
venture model remains focused on perception, valuation, and liquidity
events - not on building enduring, self-sustaining businesses.

QUICK LINKS

 YOU CAN JUST DO THINGS (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI has unlocked "permissionless leverage," empowering anyone to
create value and build influence without needing approval from
employers, investors, or institutions. 

 STRATEGY SHOULD AIM FOR CLARITY NOT JUST MOTION (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Strategy is a guiding framework - not a rigid plan - and addressing
three key gaps (knowledge, alignment, and effects) is crucial to
ensuring teams move with purpose.
