 TOMORROW: LEARN AI PRICING STRATEGIES THAT UNLOCKED $80M ARR IN 7
MONTHS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Every exec wants an AI strategy, but pricing it is still an open
question.

Elena Verna, Head of Growth at Lovable, negotiated this challenge to
grow Lovable's ARR by $80M - in under seven months, and with a lean
team.

She'll join the Metronome team on December 10 [4] to discuss what
makes AI pricing uniquely complex [4], why traditional models fall
short, and what it takes to evolve from usage-based toward
outcomes-based value.

NEWS & TRENDS

 BUILDING IN PUBLIC IS SCARY. DO IT ANYWAY (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Polished, infrequent launches slow digital teams down, while building
in public creates momentum and trust through steady shipping and open
communication. The approach works when builders share updates often
and stay focused on real user needs. 

 NETFLIX AND THE HOLLYWOOD END GAME (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Netflix's rise shows that Internet distribution, not content, holds
the real power. Buying Warner Bros. is a bid to own the IP it boosts.
Netflix's biggest threat now is YouTube and the surge of
user-generated content competing for attention. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY LABELING RELATIONSHIPS IS SO IMPORTANT (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Companies default to tidy hierarchies, but real operating systems
behave like complex networks. When you map the real relationships, you
uncover how strategy and execution actually work. 

 WHY YOUR MARKETING ISN'T WORKING (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The insights explore weak marketing engines, the rising PMF
treadmill, shifting SaaS exits, and how OpenAI might scale its
revenue.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 PAYMENTS EXPERIENCES THAT WORK OR  _AND _THAT INSPIRE (SPONSOR) [9]

customers deserve. Get the best of both worlds with Marqeta [9]: a

 THE CINDERELLA “GLASS SLIPPER” EFFECT (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A few AI models achieve instant, lasting retention by perfectly
solving a high-value workload for early users, creating a “Glass
Slipper” cohort that never leaves. This raises the stakes on
launches: teams must deliver a real capability breakthrough, because
the first perfect fit wins. 

 BUILDING PRODUCTS FROM ZERO: WHAT REALLY MATTERS WHEN YOU'RE THE
FIRST PM (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Listen early, define principles, move fast, and trust qualitative
insight before metrics settle. Staying close to customers and
documenting choices builds a solid product foundation that can grow
with the company. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 THIS IS HOW TO FIND MEANING IN LIFE: 6 SECRETS FROM RESEARCH (9
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Meaning is something we build through values, connection, awe, work,
and the stories we craft about our lives. It appears when we show up
consistently, even when life feels ordinary or hard. 

 THE PROBLEM WITH PRODUCT REVIEWS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Product reviews often focus on small fixes instead of clarifying
whether the problem matters or the product can succeed. Companies
equate speed with coding quickly, so reviews become checkpoints
instead of sources of real insight.

 CAN WE DRIVE THE SAME OUTCOME FOR DIFFERENT CUSTOMER SEGMENTS? (2
MINUTE READ) [15]
