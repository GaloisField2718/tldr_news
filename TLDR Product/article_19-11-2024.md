 ‚ùå üóìÔ∏è HOW ATLASSIAN RAN AN ENTIRE PROJECT WITHOUT A SINGLE
MEETING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Getting rid of meetings is possible, and easier than you think‚Ä¶

In this session, Andrew Boyagi from Atlassian will walk through the
"meeting-less project" that sparked a viral LinkedIn post earlier this
year. You'll leave with:

	* Clear guidance on how to structure and communicate throughout a
project - without meetings.
	* Tips for effectively using Jira for project management, Confluence
for documentation, and Loom for project communication [5].
 	* Best practices for introducing flexible ways of working to teams
of all type.

NEWS & TRENDS

 HEY, GROWTH TEAMS: HERE'S HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH YOUR DESIGNERS (6
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Growth and design teams often clash due to differing priorities.
Growth prioritizes rapid testing and iteration to achieve short-term
goals, while design focuses on polished, cohesive experiences for
long-term brand integrity. Bridging this gap requires mutual
understanding, collaboration on metrics, iterative design processes,
and mutual respect for the unique value each team brings to product
success. 

 P-HACKING YOUR A/B TESTS (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Pharmaceutical companies and marketers alike can unintentionally
mislead themselves (and others) by running tests until they get
favorable but potentially false-positive results - a fallacy known as
"p-hacking." To avoid this trap, practitioners should run multiple
trials to confirm results, avoid early test stoppage, and instead
design experiments around solid theories, testing specific hypotheses
to gather real insights and build on validated learnings rather than
just chasing seemingly positive but unsubstantiated results. 

 A CHANCE TO BUILD (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Silicon Valley's tech dominance was shaped by high initial
investments in semiconductor manufacturing with minimal marginal
costs, which later influenced venture capital and software-driven
growth. Today, while software innovation thrives in Silicon Valley,
hardware production remains entrenched in Asia. The introduction of
tariffs and geopolitical shifts present both risks and opportunities
to revitalizing U.S. manufacturing through automation and AI-driven
models, but the challenge remains significant without extreme
measures.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HOW PMS CAN 10X QUALITY WITH DOGFOODING - SIMPLE APPROACH, IMPRESSIVE
RESULTS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Using your own product (dogfooding) can provide invaluable insights
into its true value and potential issues, though it shouldn't replace
real customer feedback. This practice is most effective in B2C
products but can also benefit B2B contexts. When combined with
systematic testing, it leads to better product quality and
understanding of user experience. 

 DOES ANYONE REALLY EVER "COMPLETE" A SPRINT (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Rather than pursuing a perfect sprint process, teams should focus on
realistic planning that reflects actual conditions while consistently
delivering measurable value. Success comes from continuous learning
and improvement, coupled with transparent expectation management that
builds trust. The focus should be on practical outcomes rather than
process perfection.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 THE GUIDE TO INTEGRATION MARKETPLACES FOR B2B SAAS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Many B2B SaaS integrations don't work well for customers. They might
feel bolted on, be hard to discover, or lack flexibility. Learn how
offering customers an integration marketplace [11] can improve
customer experience and increase adoption and how to get your
marketplace off the ground quickly. Get the guide by Prismatic [11] 

 THE OKR TRAP: REPORTING VS. PROGRESS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OKRs that genuinely measure progress prioritize leading,
influenceable metrics tied to specific team actions, facilitating
actionable insights and iterative adjustments. By contrast, OKRs that
merely report numbers rely on generic, less actionable metrics.
Shifting focus toward relevant, impact-driven Key Results enables
clearer alignment with strategic goals and more meaningful progress
tracking. 

 PRODUCT MANAGEMENT ISN'T DEAD AND IT'S NOT AI THAT'S GOING TO KILL IT
(6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Product management demands uniquely human skills like empathy and
nuanced decision-making, which LLMs fundamentally cannot replicate
despite producing convincing text. While LLMs can either enhance
skilled practitioners' work or enable unskilled users to produce
seemingly acceptable outputs, this creates a concerning skills gap.
The real threat to product management comes from influencers
convincing leadership that AI can replace human product managers, not
from the technology itself.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHEN WILL WE FINISH THIS MIGRATION SO R&D TEAMS CAN WORK ON
INNOVATION? (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Migration challenges often go unrecognized as executives focus on
launches while ignoring the reality that maintaining legacy versions
for even one customer requires significant resources and support. The
solution lies in tracking migrations objectively, understanding
customer segments, making economic arguments, and maintaining
realistic expectations rather than engaging in magical thinking. 

 HOW AMAZON'S JUST WALK OUT WORKS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Amazon is phasing out its Just Walk Out technology from U.S. grocery
stores after discovering that 70% of transactions required manual
verification. The company is switching to smart Dash Carts in its
grocery stores while still expanding Just Walk Out technology in
airports and stadiums where it has proven more effective. This
strategic shift reflects both operational challenges in grocery
settings and changing customer preferences for more interactive
shopping experiences.
