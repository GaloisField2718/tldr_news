NEWS & TRENDS

 AI AND PRODUCT MANAGEMENT: BECOMING MORE EVIDENCE-GUIDED (9 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 GenAI is often portrayed as a way for product managers to crank out
documents and prototypes faster, but its true power is in enabling
evidence-driven discovery. Used well, it can lighten the cognitive
load of research and analysis while leaving empathy, collaboration,
and human judgment where they belong - with people. 

 IS THE INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA OUTDATED? (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Big tech firms don't usually crush startups by copying them - small
markets just aren't worth their effort. However, with AI labs, every
model update spawns accidental products, collapsing the boundary
between platform and application and changing how software, media, and
even financial reporting get made and framed.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE PROBLEM WITH THE PERFECT ROADMAP (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Polished roadmaps create false certainty, waste time, and discourage
change. Useful roadmaps stay messy, flexible, and outcome-focused,
guiding strategy through clarity, iteration, and honest acknowledgment
of uncertainty. 

 PROMOTIONS ARE BASED ON IMPACT, NOT JUST PEOPLE SKILLS (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Advancing into management requires proving that added resources under
your leadership will drive greater business impact. Success comes from
expanding scope, building a strong business case, and cultivating
strategic relationships.

 HERO IMAGES ARE DEAD. THESE SOLUTIONS ARE REPLACING THEM (11 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Full-width hero images often waste above-the-fold space, offering
style over clarity. More effective alternatives - split layouts,
text-first designs, or search-first approaches - prioritize speed,
usability, and conversions. Testing is essential to validating impact.


 HOW TO BRIDGE THE AI EXPERIENCE GAP AND DRIVE FEATURE ADOPTION (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Users can't judge AI features without firsthand experience, creating
a value “experience gap.” Offer powerful trials first, then
monetize with intuitive limits instead of confusing usage caps.

 VERTICAL VS. HORIZONTAL ORG COUPLING (4 MINUTE READ) [13]
