NEWS & TRENDS

 ALL PRETTY MODELS ARE WRONG, BUT SOME UGLY MODELS ARE USEFUL (9
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A model can be flawed in its explanation of reality yet still make
accurate predictions, as seen in the Mayan eclipse calculations and
quantum mechanics. The best models embrace complexity and asymmetry,
reflecting real-world unpredictability rather than prioritizing
simplicity or aesthetic appeal. 

 PRODUCT, DESIGN, AND AI (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Product managers and product designers play crucial roles in
empowered teams, especially with generative AI. Product managers
ensure solutions are valuable and viable, while product designers
create optimal user experiences. Both roles are essential for building
products that customers love and that work for the business.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 COPY COPY REVOLUTION (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI-generated code is abundant but lacks the structured reasoning of
human engineers, leading to inefficiency and complexity. While humans
balance simplicity and abstraction, AI thrives on brute-force
redundancy. Embracing its raw computational power, rather than fitting
it into human conventions, may unlock its true potential in software
development. 

 WHY BACKLOG MANAGEMENT IS DANGEROUS FOR MOST TEAMS (7 MINUTE READ)
[8]

it lean, goal-oriented, and regularly cleaned fosters clarity,
alignment, and value creation.

 YOU'RE NOT WRITING OKRS—YOU'RE REFORMATTING KPIS (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Many teams fall into "OKR Theater," creating busy work instead of
real progress by adopting rigid frameworks and setting objectives they
can't control. Effective OKRs focus on measurable, influenceable
metrics and evolve based on real impact, not strict templates.

 THE NEW WAY TO BUILD SOFTWARE (10 MINUTE READ) [12]

 WHY YOU SHOULD GET BUY-IN THROUGHOUT A PROJECT (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Leaders often forget previously acknowledged risks due to cognitive
overload and optimism bias, making consistent communication essential.
Reinforcing strategy and trade-offs throughout a project prevents
misaligned expectations and protects team credibility. 

 YOUTUBE TV, WIZ, AND WHY MONOPOLIES BUY INNOVATION (10 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 YouTube TV offers a superior multiview experience for March Madness
by integrating all cable games, unlike Max, which is limited by its
content rights. While YouTube TV's broader strategy aims to become a
dominant TV aggregator, Google's slow progress in expanding its
streaming partnerships raises concerns about its execution.
