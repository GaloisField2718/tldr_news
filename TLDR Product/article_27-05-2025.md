TLDR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 2025-05-27

 AI IS DEMOCRATIZING PRODUCT EXPERTISE…WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE PMS?
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 LLMs now let engineers draft product specs and gather context without
PM input.

Feeling displaced, many PMs tighten control over every decision. But
this gatekeeping creates the very bottlenecks that undermine their
value.

The solution? Build frameworks [4] that empower teams to decide
independently.

In this guide [4], product leaders at Statsig share how PMs can:

 	* Scale impact beyond individual bandwidth
 	* Accelerate delivery through distributed authority
 	* Focus on strategic work over tactical decisions

NEWS & TRENDS

 AI IS KICKING OFF THE NEXT REVOLUTION OF B2B PLG (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A new paradigm is emerging where non-technical users instantly build
custom tools without coding, bypassing traditional software bloat and
bottlenecks. This shift empowers individuals across roles to solve
problems autonomously, transforming everyone into agile,
product-minded creators. 

 THE ADS ARE COMING (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI is making voice, video, and text data newly valuable, transforming
how companies collect and use personal information. As tools extract
meaning from unstructured inputs, industries - from marketing to
software - may be reshaped by data once considered too messy to be
useful.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 YOUR PRODUCT CAN'T SEE ITSELF (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Treating observability as a planning input rather than a post-launch
add-on transforms product development by enabling teams to learn,
adapt, and iterate with clarity. By defining measurable signals early,
teams reduce guesswork and build smarter, user-informed features. 

 PROCESS PERSON (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designing effective processes - whether formally acknowledged or not
- requires empathy, flexibility, and a willingness to adapt to context
and constraints. When aligned with real needs and thoughtfully
iterated, these “unspoken systems” drive clarity, reduce friction,
and enable teams to thrive.
