 PRODUCT ANALYTICS ONLY TELLS HALF THE STORY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Behavioral analytics captures the _what_ but rarely the _why_.

Without context, product teams risk making decisions based on symptoms
rather than causes, miss subtle degradations in user experience, and
fail to see the product from a user's perspective.

THAT OTHER HALF OF THE STORY IS CUSTOMER FEEDBACK - and with unitQ
[4], you can cement the two halves together [4]. Using AI, unitQ will:

→ Ingest feedback from every channel and in any language.

→ Clean, translate and categorize customer feedback.

→ Correlate it with analytics from tools like Amplitude and Mixpanel
to give the full picture.
