 SHOPIFY UNVEILS NEW FEATURES WITH A FOCUS ON AI, UNIFIED WORKFLOWS,
AND POS IN ITS SUMMER '24 EDITION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Merchants depend on Shopify's software to not just work, but to solve
the pain points they didn't know they had. In its Summer '24 Edition
[5], Shopify announced exciting new features and tools that unify
commerce for merchants and developers alike:

 	* AI-powered product creation suggests recommendations for relevant
product categories like color, size and style based on just a few
keywords and a product image ‚Äî enabling accurate tagging and better
discoverability.
 	* Suggested Replies uses store information to quickly suggest a
response to a customer chat, which can increase conversion.
 	* The new and reimagined Markets unifies cross-border sales, B2B,
and in-person selling ‚Äî no need for multiple stores or workflows.
 	* Shopify POS (Point of Sale) adds one-tap digital receipts,
automated return policies, and combined discounts.

NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW PRODUCT LEADERS CAN GUIDE THEIR TEAM'S OKRS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Product leaders should focus on providing strategic context and
limiting the team's playing field during OKR drafting rather than
dictating specific objectives or problems to solve, ensuring a clear
translation of higher-level strategies, sharing context from other
teams, and challenging the choice of key results to maintain a
holistic view of success. 

 INTEGRATING UX INSIGHTS INTO PRODUCT PLANNING (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post covers the importance of interoperability in UX research
platforms and advocates for the shift towards "atomic research" for
better integration of insights into product planning. It highlights
challenges like data silos and the lack of robust APIs, proposing a
move towards an ecosystem of open and interconnected research tools to
avoid wasting valuable insights.

 MY FAVORITE DEFINITIONS OF GROWTH (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Growth can be defined in various ways. Different definitions include
experimentation-oriented growth hacking, value-distribution growth
motions, business performance growth chasing, and acting as the sales
team for self-serve revenue. Having a shared definition helps everyone
stay aligned. 

 ‚ÄúWHAT HAVE WE ALREADY TRIED?‚Äù (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Automating outputs can lead to wasteful practices. Leveraging the
existing experiences and solutions within an organization, as well as
learning from past endeavors, can streamline product development and
enhance effectiveness. 

 ‚ÄúIT'S A BALANCE‚Äù ISN'T ALWAYS THE ANSWER (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 You can choose one of three approaches to resolve decision-making
conflicts: find a balance between the options, make a definitive
choice, or synthesize a new solution that combines elements of both.
Each approach is appropriate depending on the context: balance when
extremes are undesirable, a firm choice when both options are rational
but contradictory, and synthesis for innovative solutions that require
additional supportive decisions.

 HOW ONE ENGINEER AT COPY.AI SHIPPED FOUR NATIVE INTEGRATIONS IN UNDER
3 WEEKS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Copy.ai (AI automation platform for go-to-market teams) was getting
constant requests from their users for integrations with Salesforce,
HubSpot, Slack, etc. However, the team was already stretched thin
working on their core product, and hiring an entire integrations
engineering team wasn't an option.

After evaluating multiple platforms, they onboarded Paragon [12] and
handed it to one engineer. That engineer shipped Salesforce [13],
HubSpot [14], Slack [15] and Teams [16] integrations all in less than
3 weeks.

How were they able to build so quickly?

 	* Managed authentication [17] and webhooks [18] for every 3rd party
service
 	* Serverless workflow engine for handling high concurrency and scale
 	* Proxy API for routing requests to 3rd party services in natural
language
