NEWS & TRENDS

 AI'S METRICS QUESTION (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Like the early internet, generative AI is full of vague metrics that
don't reflect real value. As AI integrates into other tools,
meaningful metrics will shift from surface stats to signals tied to
impact, retention, and business results. 

 THE INTERNET KILLED GENERAL-PURPOSE PRODUCTS. AI WILL BRING THEM BACK
(6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 General-purpose products declined as companies specialized in price,
convenience, or quality. AI's ability to personalize and scale may
bring back products that excel across all fronts. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 YOU CLOSED THE DEAL. WHY ISN'T THERE REVENUE YET? (5 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Onboarding has become a hidden drain on growth teams as it demands
constant firefighting instead of strategic focus. Get teams to align
around clear milestones, streamline onboarding, and unlock faster,
stickier customer value by adopting a Time to First Success system. 

 EVERYTHING TAKES LONGER THAN YOU THINK (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Unrealistic expectations, not slow progress, often cause stress.
People can reduce frustration, improve planning, and enjoy the process
more by adjusting time estimates and building in buffers.

 IN CONSUMER AI, MOMENTUM IS THE MOAT (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In consumer AI, fast model evolution weakens traditional moats.
Startups gain traction by moving quickly, iterating publicly, and
using viral tactics and partnerships to build momentum as their moat. 

 A BEHIND THE SCENES LOOK AT HOW ORG CHANGES HAPPEN AND COMMON
MISTAKES (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Reorgs often result from strategy shifts, leadership changes, or
underperformance. Driven by top-down decisions, communication rolls
out in stages, with leaders getting more detail early, while frontline
teams receive limited context and input. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 VERTICAL AI & THE PRODUCTIVITY PARADOX (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI messaging often focuses on job loss, ignoring history: new
technologies typically boost productivity, cut costs, and create jobs.
While some roles will be automated, AI's real potential lies in
expanding markets - if companies reinvest and support worker
upskilling. 

 "IT DEPENDS" ISN'T A COP-OUT (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Product leadership isn't about finding universal answers - it's about
navigating tensions like speed vs. quality or delight vs. business
goals. Embracing “it depends” with clarity, context, and
experimentation transforms ambiguity into a strategic advantage.

 COURAGE IS THE NEW BOTTLENECK (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI collapsed the cost and time needed to test ideas, shifting product
development from slow, high-stakes cycles to rapid, truth-seeking
iterations. 

 ACT, THEN REFINE (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Letting go of the need to be right unlocks greater creativity, as
trusting personal experience over fear-driven validation leads to more
authentic, courageous work.
