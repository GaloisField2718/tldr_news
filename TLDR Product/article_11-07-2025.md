TLDR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 2025-07-11

 INGEST USERS' DATA AND ENFORCE RAG PERMISSIONS WITH TWO APIS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Struggling to get adoption for your AI product?

It's not your LLM or agent architecture.

It's because most products lack user-specific external context.

And that context is everywhere, spread across their Google Drive files
[5], Confluence docs [6], or Notion workspace [7].

But it takes months of engineering to build those integrations.

Managed Sync [8], Paragon's newest product, abstracts away those
challenges with two APIs.

 	* Sync API - ingest files/documents/knowledge-bases with one API
call
 	* Permissions API - enforce 3rd-party permissions in your RAG
pipeline

NEWS & TRENDS

 MONETIZATION ISN'T JUST PRICING (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stakeholders increasingly expect product managers to clearly link new
features directly to revenue growth, rather than relying solely on
high-level business cases. To confidently address monetization
questions, PMs should clearly define target customers, pricing
strategies, value assumptions, validation methods, and tradeoffs
involved. 

 WHAT CAN AGENTS ACTUALLY DO? (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI agents use LLMs plus tools to evaluate context, suggest actions,
control flow, and operate as software programs. They can greatly
improve systems like support or bug triage, but only if the underlying
software and design are strong - otherwise, agents just magnify
existing issues.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 EMPOWERED FOR DELIVERY, BUT… (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Tech companies balance team autonomy with managerial oversight,
rewarding initiative and boundary-crossing for productivity, but
restricting open dissent to controlled, often ineffective channels.
True empowerment requires deeper organizational trust and safety,
which many companies superficially promise but rarely provide. 

 WHY YOUR POWER USERS ARE YOUR BIGGEST PRODUCT RISK (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Product managers face the "power user paradox," where enthusiastic
users push niche features that distract from broader product goals.
Successful teams engage power users strategically without losing sight
of mainstream needs.

smart about risk signals allows you to automatically approve
legitimate users and flag suspicious ones, reducing manual work and
improving conversion rates. Get frameworks, 50 risk signals [13], and

 SEEING THE SYSTEM: HOW TO NAME WHAT'S REALLY HOLDING YOU BACK (5
MINUTE READ) [14]

interconnected challenges, foster open communication, clearly define
strategic trade-offs, and decisively tackle underlying systemic
issues. 

 HERE IS HOW I APPROACH STARTING A NEW JOB (6 MINUTE READ) [15]
