 THE PLAYBOOK BEHIND OPENAI'S PRICING STRATEGY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 🧩 AI companies have a unique pricing puzzle to solve: users want
unlimited experimentation, but every product interaction comes at a
very real cost. Training models can cost millions, and expenses for
API calls quickly add up.

As the billing engine powering OpenAI [4], Metronome wrote the pricing
and billing playbook that AI startups need to get their pricing
right. This is a deep dive into the pricing strategies that enabled
OpenAI's soaring revenue, [4] including:

 	* Token-based pricing metrics to bridge resource consumption + user
engagement
 	* Redefining billing as a product experience
 	* The nuances of OpenAI's PayGo + prepaid credits model

NEWS & TRENDS

 THE 3 ROLES THAT BUILD GREAT STRATEGY TALENT (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Effective product strategy requires navigating "unhappy paths" -
anticipating and managing risks rather than reacting later. PMs should
proactively embrace three roles: the Realist, who spots risks early;
the Investor, who secures resources by showing impact; and the
Challenger, who continuously questions assumptions. 

 THE POLITICS OF PILOT TEAMS (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Companies are increasingly adopting the product model in response to
board pressure and the disruptive potential of AI. A well-executed
pilot team, thoughtfully assembled and supported, is essential to
demonstrating results and sparking broader transformation.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 MAKE STRATEGY YOUR SIDE PROJECT (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Successful product managers build influence by identifying strategic
opportunities that solve practical problems, staying close to daily
execution, and consistently following through. Rather than chasing
grand visions, they frame strategic work clearly, start small, and
gain trust by converting overlooked patterns into actionable results. 

 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YES TO EVERYTHING TO PROVE YOUR WORTH (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Saying "yes" to every request doesn't demonstrate competence but
creates chaos. Instead, setting clear boundaries makes priorities
explicit and elevates strategic thinking. Effective product managers
handle requests by clarifying urgency, defining measurable outcomes,
and openly discussing trade-offs to maintain focus and control.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 AI PRODUCT MANAGER GLOSSARY (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI Product Managers differ from traditional PMs by needing deep AI
literacy, intuition, and hands-on expertise with models, prompting
techniques, and evaluation frameworks. Mastery of these areas helps
PMs efficiently build, refine, and manage high-performing AI products.


 HOW GREAT LEADERS USE EMPATHY TO CREATE SHARED VISION (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Strong leaders recognize that opposing perspectives can both be
valid. With empathy, they guide people from individual truths to a
shared understanding, revealing new possibilities.

 WHY I'M BETTING ON LLMS FOR UI TESTING (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 LLMs offer promising potential for automating UI testing through
natural-language test generation and execution, solving traditional
problems like brittleness and test maintenance. While non-determinism
and cost remain challenges, solutions like guardrails, judge models,
and persona-driven tests indicate a strong, scalable future. 

 WHY MOST STARTUPS ARE BUILDING AI THE WRONG WAY (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Many founders treat AI like better software, but this misses the
point. Outsiders win by ignoring legacy constraints and using AI to
reinvent what software should be.
