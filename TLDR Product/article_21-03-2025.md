 THE INTEGRATIONS RACE: HOW AI PRODUCTS ARE BUILDING MOATS (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Aside from adapting to the newest LLMs coming out, the biggest race
between AI products today, is integrations.

THE RACE IS ACCELERATING:

	* ChatGPT launched Google Drive/OneDrive last year
	* Claude followed with those same integrations a few months later
	* Perplexity acquired an integration platform in Q4 to scale their
connectors even faster

Leading AI products are competing on two critical fronts:

	* CONTEXT ACCESS: Pulling knowledge directly from users' external
tools (Slack, GDrive, Notion, Zoom)
	* ACTION CAPABILITIES: Executing tasks across users' workflow (email,
CRM updates, project management)

This article [4]explores how companies like Intercom, Notion, and
You.com are leveraging integrations to build competitive moats around
their products, and how you can too.

 PRODUCT MANAGERS WHO BUILD TOGETHER, WIN TOGETHER (5 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Coordinating product launches without slowing down requires
lightweight alignment strategies to prevent last-minute rework. By
using shared CX checklists, centralized pricing and packaging
resources, pre-filled GTM templates, and a product manager dashboard,
teams can maintain independence while ensuring smooth collaboration
across product, sales, and marketing. 

 WHY STAKEHOLDERS DON'T VIBE WITH USER RESEARCH (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many stakeholders resist user research due to a lack of
understanding, control, time, or clear incentives, often prioritizing
quick design changes over informed decisions. To overcome this, teams
can educate stakeholders, make a strong case for research, leverage AI
for efficiency, use free research methods, and adopt a Lean UX
approach to ensure user needs shape better products.
