 FOUNDATIONS FOR VALUE MONETIZATION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI companies competing today need a system of capabilities that can

they ship, and scale revenue without adding friction or risk. From
treating pricing as a product to installing your first Chief Value
Officer, this whitepaper is your blueprint to winning in the new era
we're in: the Value Era.
