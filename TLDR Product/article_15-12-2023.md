 BUILD OR BUY: NATIVE SAAS INTEGRATIONS? (SPONSOR) [5]

[5]. Is this the right solution for everyone? What are the tradeoffs?

This guide by Paragon [5] covers all the factors you should consider
when deciding between building integrations in-house vs. working with
an integration platform. Read it here [5]
