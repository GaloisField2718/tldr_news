 SHIP PRODUCT INTEGRATIONS 7X FASTER TO ACCELERATE YOUR GROWTH.
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Do you know how Salesforce, Jira, and Slack dominated their
categories? Through integrations.
Whether it's to automate workflows or ingest data, integrating with
your users' 3rd party apps and files will drive higher adoption and
retention.

However, each integration can take 3+ months to build, and the
maintenance efforts only compound as you add more.

That's why companies like Copy.ai, AI21, and SalesHood use Paragon's
Embedded Integration Platform [4], so their engineers can stay focused
on core product features while still delivering integrations on
demand.

See how you can turn integrations into your competitive advantage

reason about the world, predict more effectively, and reduce
hallucinations.
