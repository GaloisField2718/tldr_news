 HOW PRODUCT TEAMS USE COLLABORATIVE CONTEXT TO GO BEYOND GENERIC AI
OUTPUTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When AI can see your team's research, feedback, and strategic
decisions in one place, it produces insights that actually move
product development forward.

Miro's 3-part masterclass series [4] (Nov 4-6) shows how product teams
use collaborative AI to speed up the entire product development
lifecycle.

Each 45-minute session includes live demos and practical frameworks -
covering AI-driven decision making, collaborative prototyping, and
intelligent worfklows.

 BUILDERS, SOLVERS, AND CYNICS (16 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Builders value constraints. Solvers try to remove them. Now a third
group - the Cynics - equates honesty with authenticity and glorifies
skepticism. Their alliance with Solvers fuels anti-tech sentiment,
while those who embrace uncertainty keep driving real progress. 

 A HISTORICAL TAKE ON THE AI BOOM (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI is today's App Store moment - overhyped now but soon essential.
When the dust settles, lasting value will come from PMs who solve real
problems, not just chase the buzz.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY YOU HATE YOUR PRODUCT JOB (AND IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK) (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 You don't hate product work - you're just playing the wrong game.
Pick the environment that fits your strengths, and your skills will
finally shine. 

 A VERY OBVIOUS DEAL (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Slack's pay-for-what-you-use model transformed software pricing and
shaped today's usage-based economy. Yet it also exposed a paradox:
customers resist paying for digital tasks that don't seem expensive,
forcing modern SaaS companies to tie prices to tangible costs or
partner with those who can monetize them.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 AI MONETIZATION STRATEGIES FROM A16Z (SPONSOR) [9] 

 In this live webinar with Metronome [9], Martin Casado, General
Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, will share how both startups and
public companies are shifting from subscriptions to results-based,
hybrid monetization for AI, and how emerging leaders are building

 HOW TO MANAGE FALSE RUMORS AS A HIGH PERFORMER (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 High performers can attract jealous rumors. Reacting defensively only
fuels them. Instead, stay calm, ignore the noise, and prove the
opposite through clear, visible actions that tell a stronger story. 

 THE RISE OF CONTEXTUAL AI: HOW MIRO AND AMPLITUDE ARE MAKING PRODUCTS
THAT ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND YOU (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Generic AI is done. The future belongs to contextual AI - tools that
understand behavior and work alongside people to turn data into
insight and creativity into growth.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ACCESSIBLE DESIGN VS. INCLUSIVE DESIGN: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? (5
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Accessibility lets people use a product. Inclusion makes them feel
it's for them. True inclusive design does both. 

 RETENTION IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 User retention isn't about marketing, it's about building habits.
Apps that succeed balance intrinsic motivation with thoughtful
extrinsic levers. Keep users returning because they want to, not
because you keep reminding them.
