Lowering the cost of software creation reveals hidden demand. With AI,
the bottleneck moves from building things to deciding what’s worth

 HOW ANYSCALE LAUNCHED 3 CLOUD MARKETPLACES IN WEEKS, NOT QUARTERS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Anyscale started as an enterprise-only business. Then they wanted to
add self-serve billing and sell through AWS, Azure, and GCP
marketplaces — but their homegrown billing system couldn't keep up.

The team adopted Metronome [4] as their billing infrastructure. Each
marketplace integration went live in under three weeks. Self-serve
billing — which wouldn't have been possible with their old system
— now runs automatically. Finance and product share a single source
of truth for usage and contracts.

The result: Anyscale freed up three engineers and one PM who had been
stuck on billing work — and unlocked new revenue channels that
wouldn't have been possible before.

NEWS & TRENDS

 PROOF OF CONCEPT IN 2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 When building became cheap, judgment became scarce. In 2025, the real
advantage shifted from execution to deciding what deserves to exist. 

 THE EFFICIENCY PARADOX: WHY MAKING SOFTWARE EASIER TO WRITE MEANS
WE'LL WRITE EXPONENTIALLY MORE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Lowering the cost of software creation doesn't reduce work, it
reveals hidden demand. With AI, the bottleneck moves from building
things to deciding what's worth building.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 BEYOND THE REPLICA: THE CASE FOR FIRST-PRINCIPLES AGENTS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Copying human workflows makes AI legible but limits its power. Real
breakthroughs come when agents solve problems directly, even if the
solution looks alien. 

 YOUR CAREER NEEDS A BREAKING CHANGE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Goals are fragile because they depend on certainty, while behaviors
are fully within your control. Changing what you stop, keep, and start
creates a durable shift that makes progress inevitable.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO DESIGN TO ALERT USERS WITHOUT OVERWHELMING THEM (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 When everything demands attention, nothing gets it. Designing clear
hierarchies between alarms and anomalies prevents fatigue and helps
users act on what truly matters. 

 BOUNCING BACK FROM BURNOUT (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Burnout in tech comes from chasing goals that don't matter, not from
personal inadequacy. Real recovery starts by changing your
relationship to work, not just taking a break. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 “PRODUCTIVITY”. YOU KEEP USING THAT WORD (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Software teams optimize what they measure, and too often that isn't
user or business impact. This is why AI productivity gains look
dramatic in metrics but barely register in real outcomes. 

 THE NOT-SO-LAZY HOLIDAY READING LIST (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 As AI makes execution cheap, prediction loses value and reflection
gains it. The real advantage shifts to judgment, restraint, and
understanding how systems change.

 THE NEXT BIG THING IN 2026 WILL BE… (2 MINUTE READ) [13]
