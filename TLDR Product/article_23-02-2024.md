 7 REASONS SAAS PRODUCT TEAMS USE EMBEDDED IPAAS (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Do your users keep asking for integrations with their other apps
(e.g, CRMs, ERPs, Slack)? In recent years, embedded iPaaS has become a
popular alternative [5] to building integrations from scratch (29% of
SaaS companies with integrations use it) [6].
Between authentication, learning 3rd party APIs, and building the
end-user experience, shipping an integration can easily take 3
months*. [6]

This becomes untenable when you need to manage many integrations, and
the maintenance compounds as you add more integrations. Embedded iPaaS
solutions, such as Paragon, [5] were designed to address this
challenge.

This article explains the benefits of embedded iPaaS and why you
should consider using one to scale your integration roadmap today.
