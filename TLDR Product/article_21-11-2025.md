 UNIFY PLG, SALES, AND MARKETPLACE INVOICING IN ONE SYSTEM: METRONOME
LAUNCH WEEK (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Revenue shouldn't fracture just because your go-to-market motions do.
Most billing systems force companies to juggle separate tools for
self-serve, enterprise, and cloud marketplaces—creating data silos,
reconciliation gaps, and a mess for customers and finance teams alike.

Metronome brings it all together with newly launched capabilities [4].
With unified invoicing across self-serve, sales-led, and marketplace
motions (including GCP), you can scale every GTM path from one source
of truth with consistent pricing, real-time reporting, and billing
that flexes as customers grow.

NEWS & TRENDS

 AI EATS THE WORLD (18 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI is reshaping tech. Defensibility now comes from workflow
ownership, proprietary data, distribution, and seamless UX.
Superintelligence is on the horizon. Startups must 10x workflows, keep
humans involved where needed, and anchor themselves in the layer of
the stack that will keep long-term value. 

 PRODUCT DISCOVERY MODELS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There are four ways companies approach product discovery, depending
on how centralized and how evidence-driven they are. The strongest
results come from empowered teams using data, but most organizations
drift toward top-down control unless they deliberately choose
otherwise.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY STRATEGIC THINKING MATTERS MORE THAN THE STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Do not wait for a perfect strategy. Use the clues you already have
about goals and customers to make explicit choices. Write down your
assumptions, and move the work forward. 

 SOME MISSING AI MONEY STORIES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Companies are overspending on AI out of fear and hype, but this phase
will not last. Product leaders must be ready with clear financial
cases for where AI can deliver meaningful returns.

 HOW TO STAND OUT DURING PRODUCT INTERVIEWS IN THE ERA OF AI (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Getting a PM job today means showing curiosity about AI, doing deep
product research, and building quick prototypes before the interview.
The candidates who actively demonstrate value, guide the conversation,
and follow up with insight are the ones who stand out. 

 THE SIMPLE SECRET TO INFLUENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 True leadership is not about showing you are smart, but helping
others feel smart. Leaders who ask questions, listen well, and give
credit build deeper trust and far greater influence.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GAS-FIRED INTELLIGENCE (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 US natural gas is no longer an endless, cheap oversupply. LNG exports
and AI data centers are competing for the same molecules. In the
coming years, gas is likely to become the core near-term power source
for AI. Some export ambitions will be curtailed so domestic demand can
be met. 

 RECOGNIZING HOW BIAS COMPOUNDS AT LEADERSHIP LEVELS (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Affinity bias, confirmation bias, and negativity bias quietly limit
opportunities for women and minorities. Small, often hidden decisions
accumulate over time, shaping who advances and who gets left behind.
