NEWS & TRENDS

 THE BULLETPROOF PM AI CANNOT REPLACE (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A bulletproof PM combines soft skills (leadership, communication,
drive, and flexibility) with hard skills (business acumen,
experimentation, and data analytics). Five key differentiators set
exceptional PMs apart: having a strong sense for detecting
inefficiencies, the courage to challenge norms, an entrepreneurial
mindset focused on value creation, a results-driven approach, and the
ability to let go of failed initiatives. 

 AI'S UNEVEN ARRIVAL (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Box's IPO a decade ago showcased the SaaS business model of acquiring
customers at high initial costs to maximize LTV, a strategy that
shaped modern SaaS dynamics and emphasized cohort-based growth despite
significant aggregate losses. Similarly, the rise of digital
advertising redefined targeting and conversion but exposed challenges
for traditional brands, paralleling how AI advancements like OpenAI's
o3 model may disrupt entrenched businesses by enabling task-based
automation that newer, more agile companies will adopt faster than
established corporations.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE ART OF STORYTELLING (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Great storytelling builds human connections through four key
elements: connecting with your audience by addressing their interests,
crafting compelling narratives that are more memorable than facts
alone, choosing the right medium for your story's delivery, and
evoking emotional responses that create lasting impact and inspire
action. 

 THE PRICE OF YOUR PRODUCT IS WRONG (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most companies fail at pricing by relying on executive opinions,
qualitative data, or single inflexible price points. Success requires
measuring comprehensive metrics, conducting regular price sensitivity
tests, experimenting with new users first, and making isolated pricing
changes rather than bundling them with other updates.

 THE AI SKILL THAT WILL DEFINE YOUR PM CAREER IN 2025 (9 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 To become an AI PM, focus on mastering key skills such as
understanding AI fundamentals, customer obsession, prototyping
curiosity, learning from successful AI products, and evaluating AI
performance. AI tools empower PMs to build and iterate rapidly,
shifting focus from documentation to solving real-world problems, with
evaluations playing a critical role in measuring and improving AI
product effectiveness. 

 HOW TO BUILD YOUR PRODUCT TEAM FROM SCRATCH, ATTRACT TOP PRODUCT
TALENT, GO MULTI-PRODUCT, AND MORE (90 MINUTE PODCAST) [12] 

 Founders should act as product managers early on, hiring a PM only
when the workload grows too large. The type of PM depends on the
product's stage - Pioneers for early development, Town Settlers for
growth, and City Planners for scaling. For multi-product expansion,
focus on adjacent opportunities with proven demand, treat new teams
like startups, and prioritize a few high-potential bets to maximize
impact.

 LET'S MAKE IT BETTER: SOLVING THE REAL PROBLEMS THAT MATTER (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 The product mindset - identifying root causes rather than just
symptoms - can transform challenges beyond the workplace. This
approach helps create lasting solutions in both professional and
personal spheres by combining curiosity, empathy, and systematic
problem-solving. 

 WIKIPEDIA'S $169M "MAYBE LATER" TRICK ⏰ (3 MINUTE READ) [14]

sending strategic reminders, leveraging users' mental commitment to
eventually consider your offer. The implementation is straightforward:
