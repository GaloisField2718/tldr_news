 WHY NOT JUST LAUNCH IT? - AI EDITION (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Skipping discovery may feel fast, but it slows value creation and
increases risk. Even with AI speeding up development, discovery is
still essential for avoiding waste and building what users actually
need. 

 BIG IDEAS 2026: PART 2 (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI will transform industrial systems, scientific discovery, and the

bring new automation, new data sources, and new AI-native products
that change how people build, operate, and interact with technology.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 EXECUTION WON'T STOP. STRATEGY WILL, UNLESS YOU HAVE A SYSTEM (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most teams are not missing strategy - they are missing clear
communication about it, which traps them in nonstop execution. The
Strategy Flywheel helps teams regain time, choose better, and move
forward with purpose. 

 THE AI CHURN WAVE? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI startups often treat volatile experimental revenue as ARR,
creating a false sense of stability. Retention data shows that only
higher-value, committed customers provide durable revenue, making
retention the real test of AI business health.

 FACILITATING AI ADOPTION AT IMPRINT (10 MINUTE READ) [12]
