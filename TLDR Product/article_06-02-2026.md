 TAKE YOUR RAW CALL NOTES AND MAKE THEM AWESOME — WITHOUT THE
AWKWARD MEETING BOT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Transcription tools are great, but they don't know what to focus on.
Granola [4] follows your lead. It listens in on every call — without
the awkward meeting bot — and then enhances the notes you've already
written with useful context.

You get all the details you need, built around what really matters to
your business.

And once you've got your notes, you can use pre-built templates to
send them to your team. Or use AI to draft blog posts, follow-up
emails, and do meeting prep.

CURIOUS? Granola's free tier [4] comes with unlimited calls and
meeting notes. Try it [4]

 PRODUCT COACHING AND AI (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Product coaching is the biggest missing ingredient in most
organizations. AI can now provide scalable, always-available coaching
for product creators, while humans focus on leadership-level
transformation. 

 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AGENTS MEET? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI agents create system-wide effects when they operate at scale.
Designing them requires population-level thinking, not just better
individual interfaces.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HARD TRUTHS FOR B2B IN 2026 (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 If AI doesn't re-accelerate revenue, it doesn't matter. Agents are
creating a winner-take-most dynamic that's crushing the middle of B2B
SaaS. 

 SHOULD TEAMS USE THE SAME TRACKER? (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Transparency matters more than shared tooling. When trust drops,
teams get managed through proxies, and delivery suffers.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 POWERFUL INSIGHTS FOR POWERFUL BRANDS! (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Unwrap's customer intelligence platform [10] turns all your customer
feedback (surveys, reviews, tickets, and social comments) into one
clear view, using AI + NLP to surface the insights that matter most.
Teams at Stripe, DoorDash, Clay, and WHOOP use Unwrap to cut through
noise, track sentiment in real time, and make faster, data-backed
product decisions.

Book time to chat with the team. [11]

 THE AI DELEGATION MATRIX: WHAT PARTS OF YOUR UI SHOULDN'T EXIST? (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Designing with AI is deciding who is accountable at each moment. Use
a repeatable score for risk and payoff to choose between human
control, AI assistance with approvals, or constrained autonomy. 

 HOW TO BUILD AN AI NATIVE PM OPERATING SYSTEM (61 MINUTE PODCAST)
[13] 

 AI-native PMs win by building an operating system, not a tool stack.
Centralized context and MCP-powered workflows eliminate friction and
unlock new leverage. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 PROGRAMMING WITH AI, WITHOUT THE HYPE (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Programming with AI works best when treated as a tool, not a
philosophy. Its real value comes from pairing it with strong context,
clear planning, and human judgment. 

 FRAGMENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI should help humans find answers, not pretend to be one. As coding
gets cheaper, judgment, incentives, and civic responsibility become
the real constraints.

 SAYING “NO” IN AN AGE OF ABUNDANCE (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI removes building constraints, not user constraints. 

 WHAT, THEN, ARE WE PAYING FOR? (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Generative AI makes building software easy, but owning the underlying
problem remains hard.
