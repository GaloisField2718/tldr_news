 WHY BUILD A NOTETAKER BOT FOR YOUR APP? THIS API HAS YOU COVERED
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 A notetaker bot goes beyond transcription to generate summaries,
action items, formatted notes – and (if implemented wisely) big
revenue for your application. But try to create one yourself and
you'll quickly find that building a bot to take the minutes can
take… well, months.

The Nylas Notetaker [4] is one API for all your recording, analysis,
and transcription needs. It sends meeting bots to join Google Meet,
Microsoft Teams, and Zoom calls, and forwards the recordings and
diarized transcripts [4] directly to your application. The results?
The industry's fastest setup, highest quality, and happiest customers.

NEWS & TRENDS

 WHAT AI CAN'T—AND SHOULDN'T—DO FOR PRODUCT MANAGERS (7 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 AI is transforming product management by streamlining tedious tasks,
but overreliance risks eroding the empathy, trust, and deep
understanding needed to build great products. To use AI effectively,
teams must automate selectively while maintaining direct user
engagement, manual insight synthesis, and authentic stakeholder
relationships. 

 THE AI QUALITY COUP (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI is reshaping the definition of quality work, making style
replication easy but true artistry rare. Navigating this new era
demands deeper creativity, richer narratives, and constant exploration
beyond the obvious.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY YOUR PRODUCT DISCOVERY FEELS TOO THEORETICAL (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Product discovery should be treated like a product - focused on
reducing uncertainty, not rigid frameworks - with its intensity
matching the team's level of uncertainty. Success is measured by
evidence-based decisions that validate real problems, discard bad
ideas early, and prioritize impactful work. 

 7 BOLD MOVES TO DEFEAT THE BLOODY FEATURE FACTORY BEFORE IT BURNS YOU
OUT (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The true threat to product management isn't AI, but the feature
factory mindset of mindless shipping. Defeating it requires radical
focus, customer connection, and treating product development as a
strategic investment.

 MASTERING AI EVALS: A COMPLETE GUIDE FOR PMS (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Building strong AI evaluation systems enables rapid iteration,

custom metrics, and continuous data review, not just picking models or
frameworks. 

 MOST PEOPLE ARE BUILDING AI PRODUCTS WRONG - HERE'S HOW TO DO IT
RIGHT (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In the era of "compound AI," most companies bolt AI onto products,
creating flashy but shallow features, while companies like Attio
succeed by deeply integrating AI to make workflows seamless and
intuitive. By democratizing experimentation, focusing on user
problems, building invisible infrastructure, and prioritizing
human-centered evaluation, teams can create AI-driven products that
solve real problems without forcing new user habits.

 BRING IT BACK TO THE PROBLEM (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The advice to "prioritize based on value" is misleading, as "value"
is meaningless without a clear strategy, making formulas like RICE
ineffective. Instead, product leaders should align around OKRs or
prioritize critical problems to maintain momentum even without a full
strategy. 

 AMBIENT AI: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW AS A PRODUCT MANAGER (13 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Ambient AI, which operates silently in the background, enhances user
experiences by reducing friction, anticipating needs, and enabling
more intuitive, personalized products. As generative AI excitement
fades, ambient AI offers lasting, transformative value.
