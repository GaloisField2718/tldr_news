NEWS & TRENDS

 PRODUCER THEORY (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Startups keep adding data sources to give their agents better
context. This has created a loop where tools are learning from each
other's information. The products that stand out will be the ones that
produce fresh intelligence rather than those that only combine and
redistribute data. 

 GAS-FIRED INTELLIGENCE, PART 2 (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI is creating rapid growth in US baseload power demand. Only natural
gas can reliably meet that need today. Renewables will play a bigger
role in the future. For now, the grid must expand with gas-fired
generation to keep power stable and affordable.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 AGENTIC AI IN RETAIL: HOW AUTONOMOUS SHOPPING IS REDEFINING THE
CUSTOMER JOURNEY (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Agentic AI is becoming a new shopping gatekeeper, yet customers still
trust retailer-owned agents more than outside platforms. Retailers
that strengthen their onsite experience and protect data and
fulfillment will stay relevant as AI increasingly intermediates
discovery and purchasing. 

 GOVERNANCE BY PRINCIPLE, NOT BY TEMPLATE (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Companies overuse projects and programs because they assume
governance demands them, even though it does not. Modern product and
platform work needs governance built around durable units, clear
accountability, and adaptive risk management rather than rigid,
procedural controls.

 HOW TO DEAL WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AT WORK: 4 SECRETS FROM EXPERTS (7
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Some coworkers follow predictable patterns. Your greatest advantage
is controlling your own reactions so you respond with clarity instead
of impulse. 

 HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN AI PERFORMANCE COACH & “FARM-TO-TABLE
SOFTWARE” (34 MINUTE VIDEO) [11] 

 Lucas Werthein built an AI health coach that unifies all his health
and performance data to deliver insights no single expert could
provide. Mixing different AI tools can produce apps that feel
genuinely handcrafted instead of generic.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ROBOTAXIS AND SUBURBIA (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Technology has narrowed the gap between city and suburban living,
making the suburbs far more convenient. As robotaxis grow, they could
create a larger and safer transportation-and-delivery market that may
ultimately outgrow or even sideline Uber. 

 WHAT IS OPENAI'S PATH TO $500B IN REVENUE? (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI needs a credible route to roughly $500B in annual revenue to
support a future $1T valuation. Subscriptions alone do not suffice.
Reaching that scale in five years seems improbable even with ads and
commerce layered on top. This puts real pressure on disciplined focus
and execution.
