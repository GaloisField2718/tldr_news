 PRIORITIZATION TECHNIQUES COMPARED (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Traditional methods of prioritization in product development - such
as intuition, consensus, and rules of thumb - may be outdated,
prompting a shift toward more structured frameworks like Cost of
Delay. The focus has shifted to evidence-guided development, where
prioritization is a continuous, evidence-informed process embedded
within product discovery ultimately aimed at enhancing judgment rather
than replacing it.

 YOU SHOULD JOIN THE FEATURE DIET CLUB (5 MINUTE READ) [7]

structured tools like the Feature Sunset Scorecard and communicating
removals thoughtfully. 

 IS THAT YOUR FINAL ANSWER? WHY PRODUCT MANAGERS SHOULD ALWAYS PRESENT
A RECOMMENDATION (4 MINUTE READ) [8]

organizational politics, lack of confidence, or past discouragement.
However, they can regain influence and credibility in decision-making
by exploring options, presenting evidence, and stating clear
preferences.
