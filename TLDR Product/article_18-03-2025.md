READ) [7]

 THE 2025 PRODUCT STRATEGY PLAYBOOK (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An effective strategy requires making clear choices about what not to

feedback, and refining it over time.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 OUTCOMES ARE HARD (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Transitioning to a product model requires shifting from outputs
(features shipped) to outcomes (measurable impact), which can be
challenging and needs organizational change. Companies often struggle
with common mistakes like relying on outdated metrics, vague problem
definitions, and improper measurement. Strong product teams overcome
these by defining problems clearly, tracking relevant KPIs, and
refining their approach to deliver value. 

 BACK ON TRACK (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Effective leadership in transformation requires distinct skills from
general product leadership, as some leaders excel at demonstrating
best practices while others specialize in driving long-term change.
Leaders can improve adaptability by providing strategic context,
setting expiration dates for new initiatives, and encouraging team
input to foster a sense of agency and alignment.

broad quantitative data, pilot testing provides deep qualitative
feedback, enabling teams to iterate rapidly and refine their approach
for greater market success.
