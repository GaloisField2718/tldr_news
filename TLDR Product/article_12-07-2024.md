 LET'S SAY ‚ÄúDISCOVERY‚Äù: WHY ‚ÄúVALIDATION‚Äù IS THE WRONG WORD (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The term "validation" in startup culture implies a false sense of
certainty in product development. "Discovery" better reflects the
ongoing, iterative risk management process necessary for creating
successful tech products. This shift in mindset, from seeking
validation to embracing discovery, helps teams manage uncertainties
and continuously adapt to market changes.
