 THE END OF THE USER INTERFACE? (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI agents - and eventually quantum computing - are reshaping
interfaces from visual control panels into conversational,
trust-based, anticipatory experiences. To stay relevant, product

interaction strategy. 

 OPTIMIZE FOR FEELING LUCKY (6 MINUTE READ) [6]

remember no choice is forever.

RIGHT (10 MINUTE READ) [12]
