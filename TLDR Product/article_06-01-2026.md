 FRAMEWORK + SCORECARD: AI PROTOTYPING FOR PRODUCT LEADERS (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 According to Forrester, 88% of engineering, product, and design
leaders think prototyping needs to happen earlier. Wait til late in
the lifecycle to surface changes and you'll get months of delays.

🤔 But to find issues when you still have time to fix them, you need
tools that create editable prototypes, not fully fleshed bad ideas. 

In this Miro guide [4], product leaders get a:

1️⃣ Question set to define requirements & priorities

2️⃣ AI prototyping landscape overview

3️⃣ Tooling evaluation framework + scorecard [4] 

Tackle problems early in the lifecycle by accelerating your
prototyping strategy. Get the guide to learn how.  [4]

 CREATING SPACE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Focus means stopping most things so the right few can win. Clarity
comes from saying no to everything that doesn't move you toward the
mountain. 

 IDEAS ARE CHEAP, EXECUTION IS CHEAPER (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 When code becomes free, judgment becomes the moat. The winners will
be those who choose the right problems, learn fastest, and reach the
right people.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 YOUR METRICS ARE AN AVOIDANCE STRATEGY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Metrics are empty without shared intent. Real progress comes from
aligning teams on what success truly means and designing work around
that clarity. 

 AI NEEDS GAME DESIGNERS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI work is becoming orchestration, not execution. Game designers
already know how to design interfaces for managing autonomous systems,
which is exactly what AI now needs.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 66% OF CPOS ARE MEASURED ON CUSTOMER GROWTH, BUT INFRASTRUCTURE IS
EATING DEVELOPER TIME (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Expectations are sky high, but 45% of developer time goes to identity
work — almost as much as building the actual product. Read the full
Okta/ESG research in _Beyond features: product leaders' new mandate
for growth, AI, and customer trust_ [9]. Looking for more technical

 MY 2026 FOCUS AREAS (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In a world where AI makes everything easy to build, judgment becomes
the constraint. The future belongs to tools and workflows that help
humans express intent, interpret outcomes, and decide what truly
matters. 

 BEING ON THE RECEIVING END OF AI DOESN'T HAVE TO SUCK (3 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 AI should make experiences better, not just cheaper. The real
opportunity is using AI where it uniquely helps customers, not forcing
it into every workflow.

MISCELLANEOUS

 YOUR RESOLUTION ISN'T THE PROBLEM. YOUR MEASUREMENT IS (4 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Resolutions fail when success is undefined. Clear measurement creates
clarity, reveals the real goal, and turns vague intention into
meaningful change. 

 21 LESSONS FROM 14 YEARS AT GOOGLE (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Great engineers optimize for users, clarity, and trust, not
cleverness. Careers compound when you reduce unnecessary work,
communicate clearly, and invest in people over time.
