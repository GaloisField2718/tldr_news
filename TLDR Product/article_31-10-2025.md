NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY TECH NEEDS PERSONALIZATION (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Modern mapping and AI systems prioritize efficiency over empathy,
erasing human nuance and routine. True progress lies in
personalization - technology that recognizes patterns, preferences,
and the emotional texture of daily life. 

 STILL STANDING: THE NINE LIVES OF A PRODUCT MANAGER (6 MINUTE READ)
[6]

stronger leadership.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY AI CANNOT SIMULATE YOUR CUSTOMERS' BEHAVIOUR (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LLMs can mimic human survey responses but not real behavior, making
their insights unreliable for strategy. True differentiation still
comes from real customer conversations, not simulated intent or
synthetic data. 

 WHAT VMWARE'S FORMER CEO SAYS YOU SHOULD PRIORITIZE AFTER
PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (5 MINUTE READ) [8]

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 TURN IDEAS INTO PRODUCTS WITH VIBE SOLUTIONING (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Don't settle for a half baked prototype. Use Rocket [9] to turn your
product vision (or Figma designs) into full-stack apps with UI,
backend logic and AI workflows. Iterate, maintain, and integrate new
features without wasting dev cycles. +400K users are already vibe
solutioning. Discover Rocket [9] 

 MARKETING ATTRIBUTION IS A LIE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Marketers have mistaken dashboards for understanding, killing
creativity in the name of “data-driven” decisions. Real growth
comes from balancing analytics with intuition - using attribution
tools for optimization, not strategy - and investing again in brand,
demand creation, and human insight. 

 HOW TO GET FASTER APPROVAL FROM YOUR MANAGER (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Managers approve slowly because they own the consequences. Make it
easy to say yes - anticipate questions, flag risks, and clearly state
what you need. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 BE THE NAVY, NOT PIRATES (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Great organizations evolve from daring pirates into disciplined
navies. Lasting success demands structure, doctrine, and courage -
turning individual boldness into collective power that endures beyond
the founder. 

 THIS IS HOW TO FIND MEANING IN LIFE: 4 SECRETS FROM PHILOSOPHY (10
MINUTE READ) [13]

emptiness head-on. Meaning isn't discovered, but created through
responsibility, empathy, and passionate living in the face of The
Absurd.
