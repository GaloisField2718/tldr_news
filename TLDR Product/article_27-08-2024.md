 COMPARE YOUR PRODUCT'S PERFORMANCE WITH YOUR PEERS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Developing a product without data is a lot like roadtripping without
directions. Sure, you can hop on the highway without your GPS‚Äîbut
you need guidance to reach your destination as quickly and efficiently
as possible.

The very best product teams use benchmarks [4] (think: user retention,
feature adoption, and stickiness) to compare, understand, and improve
performance.¬†

Learn what KPIs you should track, and what's considered ‚Äúgood,‚Äù in
Mind the Product's global benchmarks report [4]. Powered by 6,800
applications using Pendo, so you can understand how you're doing (and
where to improve).¬†

NEWS & TRENDS

 PROFITABLE ON DAY 1 (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Business owners may mistakenly claim profitability based on minimal
expenses, but true profitability means being able to afford to pay
others to do your job and sustaining a business without depleting
personal savings. Building a genuinely profitable business takes time
and early stages often involve financial struggle, so they should
focus on realistic goals and sustainable growth instead of premature
profit claims. 

 INPUT COFFEE, OUTPUT CODE: HOW AI WILL TURN CAPITAL INTO LABOR (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI is driving a major transformation where software becomes labor. It
is not eliminating white-collar jobs, but creating new "AI jobs" that
weren't feasible before. AI software companies will fall into three
categories: tools enhancing existing software, tools that could
replace existing software, and tools that perform entirely new tasks,
essentially becoming labor itself.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 SHOULD YOU PRODUCT-LED GROWTH? (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Whether to adopt product-led growth or not is often misunderstood.
Most companies blend PLG with sales-led models, and the key is finding
the right balance. Ignoring PLG risks disruption, while overdoing it
can harm unit economics. For many established companies, adapting to a
market that now expects a mix of self-serve and sales is essential. 

 CHEAP! CHEAP! THE PERILS OF LOW COST BEING YOUR ONLY ADVANTAGE (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 As a small competitor, you can grow unnoticed, but eventually, bigger
rivals will catch on. Relying on low prices alone is risky ‚Äî larger
companies can undercut you, and price wars squeeze margins. Build a
true differentiator, or you risk being disrupted when someone offers a
similar service for less. 

 BUILDING ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS: HOW TO MANAGE COMPLEXITY AND CUSTOMER
NEEDS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Two common pitfalls in enterprise product management are
underestimating customer complexity and failing to manage customer
input effectively. Low feature adoption often stems from issues like
lack of true value, low usage urgency, limited awareness, or
difficulty in use.

 GROWTH TEAMS MUST LEARN PLAY WELL WITH OTHER TEAMS... OR ELSE (6
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Growth teams often face challenges when coordinating with core
product teams, as their need to influence various product areas for
business metrics can create conflict. Collaboration and credit-sharing
are crucial to ensure successful outcomes. 

 THE POWER IN BELONGING (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Humans naturally seek belonging, but its impact depends on how it's
fostered. To build true belonging at work and in communities, we must
meet people where they are, understand their motivations, create space
for constructive disagreement, and find common ground. Belonging
thrives when people feel safe to be themselves without pressure to
conform.
