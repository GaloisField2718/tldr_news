 METRONOME LAUNCH WEEK: MONETIZE AI WITH FULL PRICING FLEXIBILITY
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Metronome is the monetization infrastructure platform trusted by
OpenAI, NVIDIA, and Anthropic. This week, they're announcing a host of
new capabilities - including three new ways to support flexible and
hybrd pricing models [4]:

💺 SEAT-BASED CREDITS combine per-seat billing with usage-based
consumption, letting companies assign credit allowances per user that
can be pooled across an organization or scoped individually.

📦 PACKAGES let teams manage standard pricing tiers in a
good–better–best model. Define these tiers in Metronome, then
provision customers instantly without engineering involvement.

🪜 ACCOUNT HIERARCHY enables parent–child contract structures
where usage, commitments, and reporting roll up within a single
organization.

NEWS & TRENDS

 THE BENEFITS OF BUBBLES (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The AI frenzy is a bubble, but bubbles often build the future. Even
if the hype bursts, today's rush to invest in chips, power, and new
ideas could spark lasting innovations that drive growth for
generations. 

 PROTOTYPES VS PRODUCTS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gen AI prototyping tools expand product creation access. However,
they blur the line between prototypes and real products, which require
far greater complexity, reliability, and scalability. 

🚀 

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 MISSION, VISION, POTAYTO, POTAHTO (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most companies use “mission” and “vision” as hollow slogans.
However, when done right, they clarify purpose, guide choices, and
connect profit to impact. Define why you exist, what future you're
building, and the next milestone to get there - words only matter if
they drive action. 

 BRAINDUMP ON VIRAL LOOPS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Web 2.0 established engineered viral loops and the viral factor, but
mobile and saturation ended classic virality. Durable growth now comes
from retention-led, multi-loop products. Flashy tactics only create
spikes.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 SIGNALS-BASED VERIFICATION: IT'S NOT (JUST) ABOUT STOPPING FRAUD
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 Product leaders can improve user verification flows by layering
passive, active, and behavioral signals. While the most common use
case for risk signals is fraud, you can use the same principles to
increase conversion, reduce friction, and make verification smarter
[9] and more dynamic. Learn how to use signals across the customer
journey in Persona's guide to a signals-based product strategy [9].

 HOW TO GET FEEDBACK (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 As leaders rise, honest feedback fades. Building trust, inviting
openness, and modeling vulnerability make feedback safe and essential
for continued growth. 

 WHY VALUE OUTLASTS VALUATION (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Enduring success in technology comes from creating real value, not
chasing inflated valuations. Lasting impact arises when products solve
genuine problems rather than impressing investors with hype.
