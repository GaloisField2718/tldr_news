MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pre-mortems are proactive meetings designed to identify and address
potential risks before a product launch. They help teams align,
anticipate challenges, and refine their plans for success. Pre-mortems
improve collaboration, build psychological safety, and increase the
likelihood of a smooth and effective launch. 

 THE GREAT CREATIVE UNBUNDLING (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI is disrupting traditional organizational advantages by giving
independent creators similar capabilities with fewer resources and
enabling companies to operate with smaller teams. This shift
particularly impacts junior creative roles as value is moving from
tactical execution to strategic direction, forcing both individuals
and organizations to find new ways to combine AI with human
creativity.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 YOUR PRODUCT CULTURE ISN'T BROKEN — IT'S JUST HONEST (9 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A robust product culture isn't characterized by constant harmony but
by passionate debates, creative tension, and honest disagreement among
people who care deeply about outcomes. Rather than trying to eliminate
these dynamics, successful teams harness this energy through
transparency and effective processes, recognizing that diversity of
thought and constructive conflict drive innovation more effectively
than passive agreement. 

 IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO GROW YOUR CAREER, HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IN
YOUR NEXT 1:1 WITH YOUR MANAGER (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Performance reviews should be a culmination of ongoing career
conversations. Take the initiative by scheduling regular discussions
with your manager about goals, expectations, and growth opportunities,
focusing on understanding and closing the gap between your current
performance and next-level excellence. Proactively managing your
career development ensures your aspirations are known and supported.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 QUICK TOOL TIPS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tools and processes should serve teams, not constrain them, by
remaining flexible and focused on actual productivity rather than
artificial consistency. Start with simple solutions and test them
before scaling, while remaining willing to adapt or start over when
needed. Success comes from integrating tools with natural work habits
and being open to mixing approaches rather than forcing everything
into a single system. 

 THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH: A 3X FOUNDER'S GUIDE TO INTELLECTUAL HONESTY
(28 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When building a startup, founders should seek a co-founder who
complements their thinking, honestly assess their alignment with the
market, and evaluate ideas through a matrix of interest and ability.
They need to confront biases, such as overconfidence in their vision,
dismissiveness toward competition, or reliance on personal networks.
Founders must refine their approach, discern genuine product-market
fit, and embrace strategic decisions like merging with competitors
when necessary.

peers.
