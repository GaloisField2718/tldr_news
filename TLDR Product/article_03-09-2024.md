 WORKING IN A COMPANY THAT DOESN'T KNOW THEIR CUSTOMERS (6 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 You can generate some revenue without a clear ideal customer profile,
but scaling without one leads to wasted marketing, product-market
misalignment, growth stagnation, and higher customer churn. 

 EVOLUTION OF THE DEVELOPER ECONOMY IN THE AGE OF AI (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 This post describes the transformative impact of AI on the developer
economy, noting how AI tools are enhancing productivity, reducing
barriers to entry, and reshaping the future of programming, though
traditional coding remains relevant for complex tasks.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 FOUNDER MODE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Brian Chesky's talk at a YC event highlighted the pitfalls of
following conventional management advice when scaling a company, which
often harms founders' companies rather than helping them. He noted the
importance of "founder mode," where founders remain deeply involved in
the details, as opposed to "manager mode," which many founders find
ineffective for their unique challenges. 

 THE POWER OF STARTING SMALL TO GAIN SUPPORT AND TRACTION (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Pilot projects help secure support for complex initiatives by running
in production on a smaller scale, unlike POCs. The results indicate
whether to scale up or cut costs. Focus on learning and adapting to
reality, starting small but relevant, delivering value first before
scaling. 

 HOW TO DO THINGS THAT DON'T SCALE (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The advice to "do things that don't scale" is rooted in the hard work
of building a company, product, and demand in the early stages. Many
focus prematurely on scalable tactics and growth loops, but the
reality is that unscalable efforts are crucial for kickstarting growth
and building a strong culture. This work not only fuels your engine
but also deepens customer relationships and improves your product.

 GROWTH PRODUCT ORG CHARTS: FROM THE FIRST GROWTH SQUAD TO A SCALED
TEAM (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Structuring a growth team starts with a small, agile team focused on
experimentation and then scales to a larger, more specialized team as
the company grows and demonstrates positive ROI. It is important to
own specific metrics as the team scales and prove value before
expanding resources. 

 THE THREE MOST COMMON CHALLENGES WITH FREEMIUM ‚Äî AND HOW TO FIX
THEM (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 As the SaaS market evolves, it's an ideal time to reassess if your
free and paid tiers are optimized for ARR growth. Growth-stage
companies often face three freemium pitfalls: overly generous free
tiers, overly restrictive free tiers, and costly entry paid tiers.
Research is key ‚Äî listen to customers, observe their behavior, and
let them guide your pricing decisions.

 THE CURSE OF PERFECT (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Perfection often represents an illusion of control rather than a
noble truth. Its meaning is elusive and varies widely: it could be
defined by success, wealth, admiration, or popularity. It might
involve the absence of suffering, enduring it gracefully, or simply
savoring moments. Ultimately, no matter the metric, there will always
be someone ahead or behind. 

 WHY CAN'T AI COUNT THE NUMBER OF "R"S IN THE WORD "STRAWBERRY"? (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI's difficulty in counting characters like "r" in "strawberry"
reveals a limitation in its design, which is optimized for generating
text and understanding context rather than precise character-level
tasks. Future improvements in tokenization and reasoning tools may
enhance these capabilities.
