 CAN YOU LAUNCH A NEW AI FEATURE TOMORROW WITHOUT A BILLING CRISIS?
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 The CEO wants to see that AI feature shipped yesterday. The code
works. The model works.

Then you look at billing, and it's gone horribly wrong. Finance needs
to manually fix invoices. Sales ops are managing 50+ SKU variations.
Engineers are writing custom scripts to reconcile charges.

A a new whitepaper from Metronome [4] gets to the root cause: AI
products have multiple usage dimensions: tokens, GPU hours, API calls
- which means that billing needs to become a runtime system [4], not a
record-keeper. Also covered:

 	* Why AI breaks legacy CPQ and ERP
 	* How credit-based monetization works
 	* How to audit your current stack
