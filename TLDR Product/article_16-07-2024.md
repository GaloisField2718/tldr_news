use, with accuracy and safety, on-time and on-budget?

 STARTING AN ANALYTICS ORG FROM SCRATCH ‚Äî LESSONS FROM A DECADE AT
DOORDASH (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This piece outlines the essentials for establishing and evolving an
analytics function in a startup, covering the importance of focusing
on organizational needs, structuring data consumption, hiring the
right talent with a mix of hard and soft skills, and adapting the team
as the company grows and concluding with an analytics readiness
checklist. 

 MVP IS OVER. YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT MVE (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Startups should focus on creating a Minimum Valuable Experience,
rather than just a Minimum Viable Product. The A.C.T. (audience,
communication, and touchpoints) framework can help to identify and
deliver valuable experiences that resonate with the target audience.

 EMBRACING PRODUCT-LED GROWTH: PRINCIPLES, STRATEGIES, AND METRICS (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Grammarly's journey, scaling from 1M to 30M users in five years with
a lean team of ~300 employees, exemplifies a successful product-led
growth strategy. The strategy focuses on leveraging the product itself
to drive user acquisition, retention, and expansion. Key PLG goals
include organic growth, conversion to premium plans, and building
communities. 

 UNDERPERFORMER (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Labeling someone's performance as not meeting expectations differs
significantly from labeling the person as an underperformer, as the
former recognizes the influence of context and environment on
performance, while the latter unfairly attributes the issue solely to
the individual, ignoring the complexities of skills, experience,
attitudes, and workplace culture.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 MORE ENGINEERS IS NOT THE SOLUTION (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 PMs often say they need more engineers when CEOs ask how to 10x users
or revenue, but the true issues typically lie in strategy, culture, or
market problems. Adding engineers can temporarily worsen productivity,
lead to unrealistic output expectations, and ultimately shift the
problem from lacking engineers to hiring and performance issues.
Simply increasing headcount won't address the underlying challenges. 

 HOW TO DEAL WITH B2B SALES-DRIVEN FEATURE REQUESTS (7 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Product managers in B2B can face challenges not present in the
consumer space, such as dealing with complex sales requests and
achieving scalability. A key strategy to tackling this is prioritizing
product capabilities and creating a scalable culture, while staying
open to sales-driven needs.

 BUILD THOUGHTFULLY (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Building great products requires two distinct pursuits: creating what
customers want, which demands practicality, customer empathy, and
speed, and betting on an unproven future, which necessitates
visionary, zealous individuals who can drive ambitious, creative
thinking despite fear, bureaucracy, and skepticism. 

 GREAT EXECUTION AS A LEADER (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Great execution goes beyond visible activity and meeting deadlines -
it encompasses outstanding results, creativity, and strategic
thinking. Misunderstanding the blend of strategy and execution, as
seen in responses undervaluing Steve Jobs' execution, highlights a
lack of comprehension of what truly drives success.

 CUSTOMER INTERVIEWS ARE A MIXED BAG AND MAY MISLEAD PMS DOWN THE
WRONG PATH (2 MINUTE READ) [14]

failed hypothesis on improving retention through higher-rated movies.
