 TUTORIAL: BUILD A RAG AI APPLICATION WITH EXTERNAL CONTEXTUAL DATA IN
3 DAYS USING PARAGON, LLAMAINDEX, AND PINECONE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Customer context is critical when building AI features into your SaaS
app. And that context lives across hundreds/thousands of your users'
external files and apps (documents in Google Drive, Slack messages,
etc.).

To ingest all of this data [5] is critical, but it also means your
engineering team will be tasked with building many integrations,
taking them away from core product work.

But with the right tech stack, your engineers could ship
production-ready AI features much faster. This tutorial covers the
step-by-step process [4] of building a RAG AI chatbot application
that:

 	* Enables users to connect their Google Drive, Notion, or Slack
accounts
 	* Ingests data from these applications to make it available for RAG
 	* Retrieves relevant context from these systems to answer queries at
runtime

 THE ART OF A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To achieve a successful startup launch, founders must focus on three

proposition, while careful timing ensures alignment with market
readiness and business goals. Effective distribution strategies
leverage various channels and community engagement to maximize
visibility and impact.

 CHAT, BREATHE, AND REFLECT (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In dynamic and uncertain situations, it's crucial to reduce
communication layers, increase the frequency of information exchange,
and be prepared to handle ambiguous data, even though this requires
more effort and coordination. For leaders, trust, cognitive
flexibility, and team morale are essential to make these efforts
successful, while individual contributors should avoid self-blame and
focus on finding areas where they can improve information flow and
sense-making.

 THE FED IS BRINGING THE PUNCHBOWL BACK‚Ä¶ WHAT HAPPENS TO SAAS AND AI
MULTIPLES NOW? (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 There is an inverse relationship between interest rates and software
multiples. While recent rate cuts may boost investor sentiment for
SaaS companies, fundamental weaknesses in growth and profitability
metrics may temper this optimism. As interest rates decline,
uncertainties about the future valuation of SaaS stocks persist,
leading investors to question whether multiples will normalize to
historical averages or remain at lower levels due to these fundamental
challenges.
