MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The decision to separate product operations into a distinct role or
keep them integrated within product leadership depends on factors like
company scale, product complexity, and product culture vision.
Ultimately, it's a strategic choice to either streamline operations

existing teams manage product ops responsibilities alongside their
core tasks. 

 PLAYING GAME ONE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are two career strategies: Game One, where you focus on solving
high-leverage problems for your company, and Game Two, where you
prioritize personal outcomes like titles and scope. Playing Game One

MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Amjad Masad made three key decisions that drove Replit's explosive

like Ghostwriter and launching AI-native features. Finally, he formed
partnerships with enterprise companies like Google Cloud and
Salesforce, which boosted Replit's expansion. The launch of tools like

encouraging more thoughtful decision-making.
