NEWS & TRENDS

 CHECKING IN ON AI AND THE BIG FIVE (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The AI era is reshaping tech's Big Five. Microsoft and Amazon are
best positioned through infrastructure and partnerships, Google faces
AI's disruption to search, Apple relies on device differentiation, and
Meta scrambles to regain footing. The race for AI dominance brings
existential risks, with success hinging on partnerships, execution,
and AI's unpredictable trajectory. 

 PREPARING FOR GOOGLE ZERO (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google now uses AI to summarize its work, displaying AI-generated
snippets above its articles and eroding SEO traffic. We may be
entering a “Google Zero” era, where platforms exploit creator
content while publishers scramble to adapt, monetize, and stay visible
in an AI-driven internet.

 Retention is the ultimate product-market fit test, but AI disruption

teams need to drive real activation, boost key feature adoption,
prevent payment failures, re-engage past users, and treat churn as
vital feedback.

 WHEN AI HAS BETTER TASTE THAN YOU (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 While AI can outperform humans in skills and possibly even develop
good taste, humans uniquely have agency - the motivation to act on
what matters to them. This personal drive and choice remain humanity's
strongest advantage.
