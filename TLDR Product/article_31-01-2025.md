NEWS & TRENDS

 THE PRODUCT OPS IDENTITY CRISIS (AND WHY IT'S GOOD) (6 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Product operations lacks a single definition, as its role varies
across companies, encompassing strategy enablement, scaling product
management, improving PM experiences, and shaping product culture.
This diversity is a strength, allowing teams to adapt product ops to
their needs and ensuring its impact remains flexible and valuable. 

 NOTES ON DEEPSEEK: GENERATIVE AI IS ALL ABOUT THE APPLICATIONS NOW (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The focus is shifting from AI infrastructure spending to what can be
built with it, exposing underwhelming results from generative AI
products despite the hype. Cheaper AI could drive innovation, but its
future utility and advancement remain uncertain.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 MY PRODUCT WENT VIRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUT ALL I GOT WERE THESE SH*TTY
USERS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Going viral on social media often brings a surge of low-quality
users, or "Looky-Loos," who don't stick, making such spikes
unsustainable. True success lies in durable growth, scalable channels,
and high-intent users, measured by retention and long-term engagement,
not fleeting DAU increases. 

 THE PRODUCT MODEL AND AGILE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Product Operating Model encompasses three dimensions: product
strategy, product discovery, and product delivery, with Agile
primarily contributing to the third. While Agile principles remain
valuable, the product model extends beyond Agile's scope by focusing
on solving the right problems and achieving outcomes, making
experience in product strategy and discovery more critical than
certifications.

 HOW TO FOSTER AI ADOPTION: FROM ISOLATED FEATURE TO A CORE EXPERIENCE
(8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Successful companies drive AI adoption through clear websites,
strategic pricing, personalized onboarding, and seamless workflow
integration. They highlight AI's value with free resources, tailored
trials, premium add-ons, and timely feature discoverability to build
lasting user engagement. 

 MASTERING ASSUMPTION TESTING IN PRODUCT MANAGEMENT (22 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Assumption testing replaces guesswork with evidence, ensuring product
decisions align with user needs and business goals. It prevents costly
mistakes, fosters innovation, and drives better outcomes by validating
ideas before development.

MISCELLANEOUS

 REGULATE AI USE, NOT AI DEVELOPMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI regulation should target harmful uses, not development, to protect
consumers and promote innovation. Regulating model creation burdens
startups, stifles competition, and fails to address harms.
Strengthening enforcement of existing laws ensures accountability
without hindering innovation. 

 PICKING YOUR BATTLES WHEN YOU ARE HYPER-RATIONAL (6 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Focusing on being technically right can sometimes come at the expense
of effectiveness, as over-explaining or correcting minor
misunderstandings can derail conversations. Instead, prioritizing

communication and more productive interactions.
