 A DEADLY GRAVITATIONAL PULL IN PLG B2B: INDIVIDUAL-CENTRIC
EXPERIENCES (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Successful product-led growth strategies in B2B companies engage end
users but also focus on team-level adoption to drive enterprise sales
and sustainable growth. B2B PLG companies that fail to transition from
individual to team-based experiences risk stalling, as true success
depends on activating and expanding usage across teams, not just
individual users.

 5 NEW INSIGHTS FOR PRODUCT BUILDERS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Your website and brand are your first chance to stand out - don't be
boring. Design with attention to every detail, including pixels,
corners, and transitions. Combat productivity anxiety - often, you're
doing enough already. The most impactful questions start with
“who,” as people shape outcomes more than tasks. Companies seek
high-output generalists who drive projects and business growth
efficiently with limited resources. 

 WHY ORGS BECOME TOO TALL (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Companies often aim to "flatten" structures to reduce management
layers but frequently ignore the nuanced reasons for "tall"
organizations. Addressing factors such as oversight needs, structural
limitations, and cultural preferences for delegation can help
organizations thoughtfully streamline without compromising
effectiveness.

 NORTH STAR METRIC EXAMPLES TO KICKSTART YOUR THINKING (16 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A North Star metric is a single customer-focused metric that aligns
teams across a company, connecting customer value to business growth
and driving product strategy. The metric should reflect customer
value, be measurable, and directly link to revenue growth. Avoid
vanity metrics to ensure focus on long-term success. 

 NO WAIT, OF COURSE THAT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT SAAS METRIC (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Each SaaS metric - whether retention, top-line growth, profitability,
sales efficiency, LTV, Rule of 40, or NPS - holds unique value
depending on the company's stage, market, and goals. Rather than
rigidly focusing on one, companies should select metrics aligned with
their immediate needs and growth objectives, balancing simplicity with
clarity to guide team priorities effectively.

 HOW TO SAY NO (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Say “yes” to priorities and share why, make room for others'
growth, celebrate current commitments, imagine taking on the task and
check excitement 24 hours later, and test by seeing what breaks if
left undone. 

 FORTUNE COOKIES FOR THE FORTUNE 500? WAYMO THINKS SO — BUT SHOULD
YOU? (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Gary Vee's investment in OpenFortune has transformed fortune cookies
into a key player in "context-shock" marketing, a form of ambient
advertising that surprises consumers in unexpected places. This style
taps into novelty bias - our brains' attraction to the unexpected -
creating memorable, shareable brand impressions. Quirky ad placements
like fortune cookies and coffee cups aim to soften tech's image,
blending nostalgia with calculated authenticity to appear more
relatable.

 HOW TO NAVIGATE PRODUCT DISCOVERY LIKE A MAP (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Effective discovery requires flexibility, where teams select actions
based on what best minimizes uncertainty and accelerates insights
instead of waiting for perfect conditions or rigidly completing each
phase.
