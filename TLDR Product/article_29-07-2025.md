 A FRAMEWORK FOR CHOOSING THE RIGHT PLG BILLING MODEL (SPONSOR) [4] 

 For product-led growth to succeed, it needs to be easy for customers
to use your product — without putting your revenue at risk.
Metronome's new blog [4] offers a framework for choosing PLG billing
models based on company safeguards vs customer adoption barriers. It
looks at:

→ 5 different billing models including PayGo, threshold billing,
prepaid credits, and more

→ Examples of how companies like Snowflake and Salad Technologies
are successfully combining multiple billing models

→ The importance of real-time signals [4] to prevent revenue leakage
and customer churn

economics.

 SOURCES OF TRUTH (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 “Source of truth” issues in product development are rarely about
truth itself. They stem from misaligned definitions, competing
incentives, and resistance to embracing the complexity inherent in
real product work. 

 WHAT MOST LEADERS OF AI GET WRONG ABOUT DRIVING ADOPTION (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 AI adoption often stalls due to fear, confusion, and lack of
involvement, not technical limitations. Leaders must treat it as
change management: acknowledge emotions, share transparently, and
co-create solutions with teams.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO MAKE COMPETITORS LOOK LIKE ALIENS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Top-performing companies avoid direct comparisons by redefining the
game - positioning competitors in narrow roles while claiming broader
missions. The key: use simple, truthful analogies that elevate your
product into its own category. 

 HOW TO GET RECOMMENDED BY CHATGPT (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI answer engines like ChatGPT and Google are reshaping B2B
discovery, replacing search with direct recommendations. To stay
visible, brands must optimize for AI prompts with specific content,
Reddit mentions, structured comparisons, and influence, not just
clicks.

 EVERYONE IS CRAZY NOW (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Social media has turned attention into power, making virality the new
path to influence. Today's leaders are often chosen not for
competence, but for performance - rewarded for being unhinged, not
steady - and the same machine that drives stardom is now shaping the
future of politics, tech, and business. 

 WHAT FOUNDERS TEACH US (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Founder-led companies thrive on unshakable optimism, risk-taking, and
relentless execution. Their fearlessness, curiosity, and conviction
attract top talent and drive progress - even through uncertainty -
offering lessons any leader can adopt.
