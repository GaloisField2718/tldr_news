 [TUTORIAL] GIVE YOUR AGENTIC AI PRODUCT 3RD-PARTY ACTIONS (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 RAG solves the context problem for AI agents.

But once the agent has context, it needs to automate tasks.

That's why everyone's talking about MCPs and agentic actions (tool
calling) [4], but most companies have yet to productize this
functionality.

In this tutorial [4], we walk you through exactly what you and your
engineers need to know to build an AI agent SaaS feature that can take
action in your users' 3rd-party apps, such as:

 	* Sending your customers Slack/Teams messages
 	* Querying/updating your customers' CRMs
 	* Creating documents in Google Drive/SharePoint

NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY AI IS DANGEROUS FOR MOST TEAMS (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Generative AI amplifies whatever product culture it enters - good or
bad - making broken processes more dangerous. To truly benefit, teams
must rethink roadmaps, highlight risks, and use AI to drive smart,
strategic action. 

 WHEN CUSTOMERS BUY YOUR COMPETITOR'S PRODUCT… AND THEN BUY YOURS (9
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Enterprises often buy both expensive and cheap tools for the same job
because the cheaper one offers unique value, is easy to buy, and
bypasses red tape. Startups can win by building focused tools,
simplifying purchasing, and growing small wins into larger deals
through trust and utility.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE SILENT STRAIN OF SOLO PRODUCT MANAGERS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Strong product managers thrive in ambiguity, but unchecked solo work
breeds misalignment, rework, and team strain. Balancing independent
progress with lightweight collaboration ensures speed doesn't
sacrifice trust or outcomes. 

 THE NASTY SIDE EFFECTS OF BAD PLG (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Romanticizing PLG ignores its limitations, like capped revenue
potential, hidden costs, and missed insights from real customer
conversations. Scalable success demands blending PLG's efficiency with
sales-driven depth and strategy.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW APPLE AND NOTION USE JAKOB'S LAW, A PSYCHOLOGY HACK, TO WIN (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Users expect your app to work like others they know, so great design
leverages familiar patterns and mental models to create intuitive,
seamless experiences rather than reinventing the wheel. 

 HOW TO IDENTIFY HIGH-LEVERAGE IMPACTS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 An Impact is a specific lagging metric tied to company or team goals
that helps focus Product Discovery with clear starting points.
Grounding Discovery in strategic Impacts, often from OKRs, guides
targeting, reduces ambiguity, and drives meaningful outcomes. 

 THE CXO GUIDE TO BUILDING AN AI-FORWARD TEAM (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Leading companies embed AI into their culture by pairing strong
leadership with focused funding and high-impact use cases. They build
momentum through experimentation, cross-functional hackathons,
targeted training, and by weaving AI into hiring, performance, and
core operations for scalable transformation.

 HOW TO STOP HOLDING YOURSELF BACK (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Power means influence, and too often, people quietly give it away
through hesitation, silence, or outdated self-protection. Reclaiming
it begins by recognizing the stories that hold us back and choosing to
show up boldly. 

 THE GENIUS OF SVPG (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The book 'Transformed' helps product leaders embrace change without
ego, making it a powerful tool for internal transformation. It shows
that real change requires more than knowledge - timing, structure,
legitimacy, and context-specific approaches all matter.
