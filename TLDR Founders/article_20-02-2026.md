HEADLINES & TRENDS

 FUNDRAISING STARTS BEFORE YOU NEED CAPITAL (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Most founders lose the fundraising game by waiting until they need
money to start pitching. The real process begins with building an
investor prospect list and seeking feedback rather than capital to
establish early relationships. By sending monthly updates and
executing publicly, founders create scarcity and FOMO, often securing
commitments before a round even officially opens. 

 POWER IN THE AGE OF INTELLIGENCE (43 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tech companies like Stripe, SpaceX, and Base Power illustrate the
"winner takes more" trend, where firms leverage technological
advancements to dominate industries. The focus shifts from protecting
software moats to identifying industry constraints, breaking them, and
seizing "High Ground" for expansion. As technology progresses,
companies controlling scarce assets benefit the most, driving
increased economic concentration and growth opportunities. 

 THE SOFTWARE SHAKEOUT: WHAT IS DURABLE AND WHAT IS NOT IN THE AGE OF
AI? (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 $1T in software market cap evaporated in three weeks. This framework
sorts the survivors from the dead. Software in the path of doing work
(CrowdStrike, Stripe, Shopify) is durable. Software that generates
paperwork about work (DocuSign, Monday.com, Zendesk) gets replaced by
AI that just does it. The scary middle - Atlassian, Salesforce,
HubSpot - is eroding slowly but the cliff is coming. If you're
building a product that humans fill out so other humans can read,
rethink the entire premise before your next board meeting.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HIRING FOR A NEW ROLE/FUNCTION FOR YOUR FIRST TIME? DO THIS FIRST. (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A bad first hire in a new function costs you a year. The fix takes
one week. Before you write the JD, do 5-10 calibration calls with
people who already hold the role at companies one stage ahead of
yours. You'll learn what "great" actually looks like, what comp is
real, and which interview questions actually separate the best from
the mediocre. Most founders skip this step and end up hiring on vibes.
Don't be that founder. 

 ADVICE WE REJECTED TO BECOME ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING START-UPS
EVER (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Deel co-founder Shuooo Wang details how the company scaled by
ignoring traditional startup "best practices," such as hiring a VP of
Sales early or focusing on the SF talent pool. Instead, Deel
prioritized founder-led sales to maintain customer context, hired for
traits over pedigree, and invested in 100+ local entities to build a
moat around compliance and reliability. By favoring frugality and
vertical M&A over high burn, the company leveraged first-principles
thinking to become one of the fastest-growing startups. 

 AGAINST “AGAINST TASTE” (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Taste is informed judgment built through experience rather than
passive curation. True taste is exercised during the creation process
through invisible, compounded decisions that lead to elegance and
coherence. While AI can generate outputs, humans remain the essential
definers of quality, setting the standards and directions that tools
cannot shortcut.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 BOOST.SPACE (TOOL) [11] 

 Single source of truth database for automations and AI agents. 

 LAYERS (TOOL) [12] 

 AI marketing agents that analyze your product and run growth
campaigns. 

 CONWAY (TOOL) [13] 

 Autonomous AI agent infrastructure layer.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THERE IS NO PRODUCT (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 If you remove the difficulty, you remove the product. If it only
takes a weekend to build a product, then anyone else could do it in a
weekend, too. You can't just add features and hope the market comes
back, because there's no core product. Some software will still be an
asset, but most of it will become inventory, and every model
generation will push that line further. 

 IN DEFENSE OF VERTICAL SOFTWARE (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The industry is currently asking why vertical software needs to exist
when AI companies are pouring billions of dollars into building the
most powerful general-purpose AI systems in the world. Enterprise
software is just code, but that's not where the value of software
comes from. The value of enterprise software comes from understanding
the process and the organization well enough to make the software do
exactly the right thing. Process engineering will continue to be the
foundational advantage or vertical software.
