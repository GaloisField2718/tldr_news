 WHY PRODUCT-LED FOUNDERS NEED BE COMFORTABLE SELLING (6 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Many product-focused founders neglect sales until it's too late.
However, when a company starts to scale, having a successful sales
strategy is as crucial as the product itself. A start-up can live or
die on the strength of its sales efforts. This article shares the
story of Jyoti Bansal, the founder of AppDynamics, who transformed
from being an engineering-centered founder to building a rigorous
sales machine.

 Amy Buechler, a licensed psychotherapist and the first in-house
founder coach at Y Combinator, has taught founders to manage fear and
uncertainty by focusing on self-care, establishing empowering
narratives, and building trust in themselves, their co-founders, and
the market. Her approach aims to improve startup success rates but
also encourages founders to view entrepreneurship as an opportunity
for personal growth and creating a unique impact in the world. 

 A GUIDE TO THE WEDGE MARKETING STRATEGY (6 MINUTE READ) [11]

and customers effectively. This targeted approach ensures that
marketing efforts resonate deeply, avoiding dilution across channels
and improving conversion rates. By initially capturing a specific
niche and gradually broadening either through additional use cases for
the same audience or targeting new audience segments, startups can
efficiently expand their market reach. This article provides a
framework for implementing a wedge marketing strategy.

 THE FUTURE OF CUSTOMER SUCCESS (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In this evolving landscape, customer success will become ingrained
deeply into a company's DNA rather than existing as a separate
function. This shift will likely involve specialized roles focused on
different stages of the customer journey, from onboarding to
activation. As businesses transition towards consumption models,
emphasis will be placed on continuous value delivery throughout the
customer lifecycle, with metrics other than revenue serving as early
indicators of success. 

 DANGEROUS LANGUAGE IN START-UPS (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This article discusses the impact of language and metaphors on how
startups conceptualize and market themselves, particularly focusing on
the patterns "X for Y" and "with AI." While these linguistic shortcuts
can help explain and impress initially, they can dangerously narrow
founders' focus, leading them to prioritize the technology or business
model over the actual problem being solved. Founders should opt for a
balanced approach, leveraging metaphors for early traction without
distorting their strategic focus.
