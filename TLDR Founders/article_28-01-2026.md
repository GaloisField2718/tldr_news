 IT'S NOT JUST YOU: MEETINGS ARE EXPLODING - AND DEEP WORK TIME IS
COLLAPSING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Struggling to focus? Hubstaff [4] looked at how the 140,000 people
get work done. Turns out:

 	* FOCUS IS COLLAPSING: the average person gets ~39% of tracked time
in deep focus (about 2–3 hours/day).
 	* MEETINGS ARE EXPLODING (AND STEALING MAKER TIME): over 3 years,
meetings are ~2x per person and ~6x per org. 
 	* TOOL SPRAWL IS REAL: people use 18 apps/day on average — a
direct driver of context switching and fragmented attention.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE FUTURE OF AI CREATIVE TOOLS (20 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 FLORA, an AI-powered creative tool company, raised $42 million in
Series A funding to give professional creatives more control over
their workflows. Founder Weber Wong criticized Silicon Valley for
misunderstanding creatives' needs, emphasizing the importance of taste
and control in creative work. The platform's node-based interface
supports companies like Nike and Lionsgate by integrating generative
models into customizable workflows, enabling both manual and
autonomous creation. 

 TRENDS I'M SEEING IN AI PRICING (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI pricing is getting harder as agents are running longer and more
autonomously. People dislike usage-based billing because it is
unpredictable, and per-seat pricing doesn't map cleanly to AI value.
One pricing model that has prevailed in 'credit', where customers
pre-purchase tokens for work. Credits will likely stick around, but
they still don't make AI spend feel predictable, as agents can do
wildly unpredictable amounts of work. AI products prioritizing billing
observability would make AI feel more like software and less like a
casino. 

 ENTIRE INDUSTRIES ARE NOW DECIDED IN <2 YEARS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Becoming the industry default used to take 20 years. That's how long
it took for "no one gets fired for buying IBM" to become true. With
AI, that timeline is under two. Harvey signed A&O Shearman when it was
four people, and that one deal made it credible enough to become the
default in legal AI. Landing a big customer and building industry
credibility aren't separate phases - they feed each other. Most
startups treat them as sequential. The ones who lock in the default do
both at once.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MY 3 CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS IN EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph argues that the single biggest
determinant of early-stage startup success is the team, emphasizing
execution, adaptability, and persistence over product or funding. He
explains that talent operates on a power curve and shares practical
advice on attracting and retaining exceptional people, including
hiring for future impact, cutting toxic high performers, and treating
employees with trust and honesty. 

 MANAGEMENT AS AI SUPERPOWER (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An experimental class at the University of Pennsylvania demonstrated
how management and AI tools like Claude Code and ChatGPT can
accelerate startup development. Students rapidly created diverse
prototypes by leveraging AI for market research, financial modeling,
and ideation, effectively cutting down traditional startup timelines.
Successful delegation to AI hinges on balancing task complexity, AI
success probability, and evaluation time, emphasizing the value of
management skills in optimizing AI productivity.

MISCELLANEOUS

 IS YOUR MARGIN MY OPPORTUNITY IN SOFTWARE? (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AWS's operating margins ranged between 25% to 38% between 2015 and
2025. The company prints money at scale even after a decade of cloud
commoditization. Its moat is capex, and few other companies have the
balance sheet to compete. AWS outspends on data centers, while most
companies outspend on sales teams. 

 FORWARD-DEPLOYED JOB TITLES (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Palantir renamed its solutions engineers to "Forward-Deployed
Engineers" and called them Deltas, like Delta Force. It sounded
ridiculous but worked brilliantly. The role attracted high-agency,
high-EQ engineers who might otherwise have seen client-facing work as
beneath them. The title gave the work prestige, and Palantir got a
hiring moat. Now, Harvey is doing the same thing with "legal
engineer." The test for whether this is real or just title inflation:
does the new title describe work that would have been unrecognizable
five years ago? "Prompt engineer" already feels dated because the work
turned out to be a feature of every job rather than a job itself.
