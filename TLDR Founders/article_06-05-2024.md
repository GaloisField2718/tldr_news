AI into various industries. Despite a general slowdown in new

average spending on AI tools growing by 138% year-over-year, while
finance tools also see increased usage. Businesses are maintaining a
cautious approach to travel expenditure.

 FUNDRAISING ADVICE FROM MONZO'S FOUNDER (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tom Blomfield, a group partner at Y Combinator and former founder of
Monzo Bank, shares insights on the realities of startup fundraising.
Investors often pass on opportunities based on their impressions of
the founders rather than explicit business metrics. Blomfield
highlights the importance of understanding the venture capital focus
on high-return investments, the strategic use of leverage in
fundraising, and the necessity for founders to conduct thorough due
diligence on potential investors to avoid misaligned goals and
detrimental advice. 

 EXPANDING AFTER PMF (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Expanding into adjacent markets or customer segments can drive growth
for companies that have achieved product-market fit but are facing
bottlenecks or saturation in their core business. Evaluating the level
of change required across key functional areas like marketing, sales,
product, and engineering can help determine how adjacent a potential
expansion opportunity is and inform whether the investment and risk
are justified by the potential upside.

 ARE YOU HUNTING ANTELOPE OR FIELD MICE? (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The concept of prioritizing significant goals over minor tasks is
illustrated through Newt Gingrich's analogy of a lion choosing to hunt
antelope, which provide substantial nourishment, rather than field
mice, which do not offer enough energy return. This strategy
emphasizes focusing on impactful activities that ensure long-term
success and sustainability, rather than getting caught up in less
consequential, albeit potentially satisfying, tasks.

physically close to key customers and partners, not investing enough
in customer success, and not being agile enough to stay ahead of the
competition.

regularly reviewed to identify trends, quantify issues, and prioritize
improvements that align with product objectives.
