HEADLINES & TRENDS

 BEYOND THE SCALING LAWS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A new era of innovation is emerging as the AI industry hits the
limits of traditional "bigger is better" scaling. Techniques like
real-time reasoning, novel architectures beyond transformers, and
embodied AI are opening fresh paths to more robust, generalizable
intelligence. Meanwhile, VCs are pivoting focus from bits to atoms,
seeing untapped potential in AI-driven disruption in giant industries
like energy and logistics. Seed and Series A startups pioneering this
shift are attracting the lion's share of funding. As the world enters
2025 with new leadership and a revitalized M&A market, expect a surge
of activity from investors who spot these seismic changes. 

 BRITTLE POINTS: HOW TO MAKE COMPANIES ROBUST (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Just like a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, a company is
only as resilient as its greatest vulnerability. Identifying your
"brittle points" - like dependence on a single platform, channel,
client, or employee - is the first step to building redundancy and
contingency plans. This is similar to engineering, where single points
of failure are anticipated and mitigated through backup systems. 

 PERPLEXITY AI CEO SHARES HIS ADVICE TO STARTUP FOUNDERS ON BUILDING A
TEAM (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity AI, emphasized the importance of
an "extreme bias for action" and hiring individuals with "chips on
their shoulders" during a recent Stanford talk. He also discussed
building a balanced team by recruiting complementary skills and
avoiding redundancy.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO INCREASE GOOGLE ADS QUALITY SCORE AND BENEFITS (13 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Did you know that your Google Ads Quality Score can directly impact
both your ad placement and costs? A low score can deter your ad
performance and increase costs. On the other hand, a high ad quality
score not only improves your ad visibility, but also significantly
reduces your CPC, enabling you to scale your ad budget further. This
blog provides an actionable approach to understanding the key factors
that affect your Quality Score (from ad relevance to landing page
experience), how to optimize your campaigns, improve CTR, and lower
costs – all while delivering better ROI for your business. 

 A FULL, AI-ASSISTED GTM BUILD (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most B2B teams have gaps in their go-to-market approach, lacking
buyer journey maps, clear metrics, and engagement tracking. Plugging
these holes requires focusing on the biggest constraint, usually
generating quality meetings, through targeted content, comprehensive
tracking, AI-assisted research, and personalized outreach. When
executed well, this leads to 3-5x higher response rates and
predictable pipeline growth. 

 HOW WE FOUND OUR ACTIVATION METRIC (AND HOW YOU CAN TOO) (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Activation metrics are the key actions that turn new users into
dedicated ones, but they're different for every product. In this post,
PostHog shares its process of digging into user data to uncover the
behaviors that predicted long-term retention. By testing multiple
event combinations, it found that users who watched 5+ session replays
and set a filter were most likely to stick around. Identifying your
own activation metrics requires rolling up your sleeves and diving
into the data - there's no shortcut. However, for companies willing to
do the work, optimizing these metrics can be the secret to sustainable
growth.

 WHY YOU SHOULD TRUST TRUST AND DISTRUST DISTRUST (4 MINUTE READ) [14]


 Trusting others is rational even without certainty, as it's a
prerequisite for the cooperation that has allowed humanity to thrive.
Coercion undermines real trust. Contrary to common belief, trust is an
outcome of cooperation rather than a finite resource. We learn who is
trustworthy by trusting first. The asymmetry between how hard it is to
build versus destroy trust is exactly why consciously choosing trust
is the winning strategy. 

 THE ANATOMY OF AN INNOVATION WAVE. FIVE SIGNS OF A COMING DISRUPTION
(8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Disruptive technology waves often feature innovation across all tech
stack layers, stimulating further advancements beyond initial
innovations. They involve both startups and incumbents, affecting both
hardware and software, with agents of innovation in varied sectors.
Foundational potential is marked by these waves as they set the stage
for future technology developments, as seen with AI building on past
internet and cloud advancements. 

 VC TERMINOLOGY: HUSTLE FUND'S TOP 100 TERMS ASPIRING ANGEL INVESTORS
SHOULD KNOW (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 It's important to break down barriers so that everyone can
participate in startup investing. Historically, one of the main
barriers keeping lay people from investing in the startup ecosystem
has been terminology. From “carry” to “liquidity,” “ARR" to
“ROFR,” there's no shortage of jargon in venture capital that can
confuse, frustrate, and overwhelm newbies.
