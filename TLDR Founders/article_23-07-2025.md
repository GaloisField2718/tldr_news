 AI BROKE YOUR PRICING MODEL — AND SPREADSHEETS WON'T FIX IT
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 One user query triggers 50 model calls. You suddenly realize your
"per request" pricing doesn't make sense. Users get hit with surprise
bills, while your usage dashboard is still stuck two hours in the
past.

This is the new reality of AI pricing [4]—and legacy billing systems
can't keep up. 

The solution is to apply the same discipline and iterative approach
you use to develop any new features. This first post in Metronome's
multi-part series [4] explains why successful companies treat pricing
like a product system that's testable, observable, responsive.

Pricing is your most visible product feature. Treat it like one.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 AI MARKET CLARITY (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elad Gil argues the fog has lifted. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta,
and other giants now dominate foundation models while Harvey leads
legal and Cursor rules coding. Customer support converges on Decagon
and Sierra and Perplexity stakes search. Capital and compute now block
new LLM entrants, yet openings remain in accounting, compliance, and
security. The next breakout will hinge on bold go to market, agentic
workflows, and roll‑up strategies. 

 FIGMA'S IPO ISN'T FLASHY — BUT THAT'S THE POINT (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Figma just set its IPO range at $25–$28 a share, valuing the
company at around $16B—less than Adobe once offered, but above its
2024 secondary round. It's not a moonshot, but it's solid: $1B run
rate, strong margins, and a clear growth story. While most coverage
focuses on past performance, Figma is quietly packing AI features into
its product, possibly adding upside for retail investors who still
believe in narrative.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW CLAUDE IS BUILDING A UNIQUE GROWTH ENGINE OUT OF USER-CREATED
APPS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Claude launched AI-powered apps with a clever twist - users pay with
their own Claude subscription, not the creator's. A teacher can build
a SAT prep tool and share it with students, but each student must sign
up for Claude to use it. No API keys, no hosting costs, no
authentication headaches. The constraint becomes the opportunity. Each
app spawns its own growth loop as project tools drive team invites and
calculators spread through forums. While Cursor and Bolt chase
developers, Claude went the opposite direction - maximum constraints
for minimum friction, turning every creator into a distribution
channel. 

 THIS EMAIL STRATEGY CHANGED EVERYTHING (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Citizen, a real time safety alerts app, was losing users after it
muted push notifications. Julia Knight tackled the issue by
hand-collecting local emergencies, dropping headlines into a Figma
template, and blasting fifteen tailored emails daily. The clicks
proved so strong that the team automated triggers that now send forty
million incident emails each month, bringing dormant accounts back for
free, cutting paid acquisition, and even lowering iterable costs
through renegotiation.

 SIX WAVES OF SOFTWARE PRICING (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 In the 1950s, your software arrived in a semi‑truck bolted to its
hardware. Seventy‑five years and six pricing waves later, vendors
bill for shelf‑less shelfware, meter compute like electricity, and
blend seats with usage in hybrid plans. This author traces the journey
from boxed SKUs to SaaS, the ASP flame‑out, CFOs fighting surprise
overages, and why clear value metrics will decide how we price AI
next. 

 THE AI‑NATIVE ENTERPRISE PLAYBOOK (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Now that every enterprise tool claims to be "AI-powered," what
actually moves the needle? This playbook keeps it simple: pick a weird
industry with painful, overlooked problems. Build for real workflows,
not just demo decks. Prove your product works with clear, objective
results, especially in edge cases. Let AI power more than just the
product: use it across onboarding, support, sales, and GTM. 

 HOW CARTA'S INTERNAL AI AGENTS SAVE THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF
BACK-AND-FORTH WORK (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Most teams use AI to save money. Carta used it to save time where it
mattered most: judgment-heavy accounting tasks that bottlenecked
client service. Instead of replacing humans, it built in-house agents
that could gather context, reason through complex workflows, and act
autonomously. One agent now handles 25,000 monthly tasks in seconds,
saving 3,500+ hours.
