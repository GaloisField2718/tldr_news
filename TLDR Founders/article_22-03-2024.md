STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 READ THIS BEFORE YOU PIVOT (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article highlights the significance of the startup pivot using
examples of successful pivots from both historic and modern times to
explain the importance of making decisive pivots. It covers the
importance of validating problem/solution fit through rapid building,
identifying the right audience for feedback, focusing on pursuits
you're passionate about, and redefining your target customer. 

 HIGH-QUALITY PRINCIPLES TO SUPPORT YOUR PRODUCT-LED-GROWTH (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Kate Syuma (Ex-Miro Head of Growth Design) explores how successful
PLG companies such as Notion, Canva, and Figma manage to establish and
maintain a high level of product quality during the onboarding
process. This article offers a practical guide to creating
straightforward and intuitive onboarding experiences that effectively
showcase the product's core value right from the start. 

 MAYBE YOU DON‚ÄôT NEED PLG AFTER ALL (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article discusses the author's experience with removing the free
tier from their product, CommandBar, and transitioning to a sales-led
approach, which resulted in more meaningful engagement with prospects,
better qualification of product-solution fit, and increased deal sizes
and conversion rates. Despite some negative feedback, the author found
that for their product, which requires team use and organizational
trust, a sales-led model was more effective than a product-led growth
(PLG) strategy.

 PURSUITS THAT CAN‚ÄôT SCALE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This essay explores why successful entrepreneurs such as Mark
Zuckerberg and Audrey Gelman of The Wing turn to non-scalable pursuits
like martial arts and small businesses. The author theorizes that
these activities help ground the founders and restore their sense of
self after experiencing the dehumanizing effects of hyper-growth in
their startups. 

 HOW THE FED AND INTEREST RATES IMPACT STARTUPS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 It might seem odd to think about the macro whilst your startup is
micro, but you should. Interest rate changes directly impact startups,
influencing borrowing costs, venture capital funding, hiring costs,
and exit strategies. Cash becomes king in high-interest rate
environments. You should be thinking about your cash management
strategy. 

 THE REDDIT STORY (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The founders of Reddit, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, served as
the inspiration for the creation of Y Combinator. Their initial
proposal for a mobile fast food ordering service was rejected.
However, they were encouraged to submit a new application with a
simpler idea, which ultimately led to the creation of Reddit.
