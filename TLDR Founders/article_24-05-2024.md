monetizing later, or "money sinks" that prioritize profitable user
acquisition and conversion. The evolution of business models, such as
the shift from print to digital media, can lead to changes in product
experience and design, with companies like The New York Times
potentially transforming into gaming companies to increase
monetization through subscription bundles.
