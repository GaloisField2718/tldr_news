 📗 USAGE BASED PRICING PLAYBOOK (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Pure seat-based pricing is quickly becoming outdated as usage-based
and hybrid pricing models come to the forefront. Customer expectations
are changing, costly AI APIs are becoming core product components, and
startups have to adjust their business models or risk being left
behind.

Metronome provides billing infrastructure for companies like OpenAI,
Anthropic, and NVIDIA. From the expertise gained in those
partnerships, Metronome has prepared this handy 4-step guide to
adopting usage-based pricing [4]:

1️⃣ Appointing a Chief Alignment Officer

2️⃣ Fixing the value metric

3️⃣ Test-driven rollout

4️⃣ Over-communication with customers

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WINDSURF'S CEO GOES TO GOOGLE; OPENAI'S ACQUISITION FALLS APART (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's $3 billion deal to buy coding startup Windsurf collapsed
Friday morning. By afternoon, Google hired Windsurf's CEO and top
researchers for $2.4 billion, licensing their tech without buying the
company. It's the latest reverse-acquihire where Big Tech gets talent
and technology while dodging regulatory scrutiny. Now they're left
with 250 employees and an interim CEO while their founders build
competing tools at Google. Every AI startup that lost its leaders this
way has struggled to maintain momentum. 

 SAAS 2.0 (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Every SaaS app is just an expert's playbook turned into software.
Salesforce encodes how the best salespeople work into lists and rules,
but it's a rough translation - like getting advice through a game of
telephone. Now AI can skip the middleman. Instead of buying software
that nudges you toward best practices, you get the actual expert
managing your data directly. A new dating app already does this - it
turns a matchmaker into an AI that manages compatibility data. Soon we
won't need apps at all, just specialists who happen to be software. 

 SVB'S STATE OF THE MARKETS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI ate half of all venture capital in 2024. While total VC investment
hit $204 billion - the third-highest year ever - AI companies grabbed
50% of all deals and 61% of megadeal dollars. They're getting 100%
valuation premiums over non-AI peers at late stage. Meanwhile,
everyone else is playing defense. The typical Series A company now
needs $2.5 million in revenue (up 75% from 2021), but growth has
cooled to 70% annually. With only 7 tech IPOs last year and 640
unicorns trapped in private markets, the liquidity crisis continues -
just 25% of unicorns even meet basic IPO requirements.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GOODBYE, MQLS. HELLO, QUALIFIED PIPELINE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This marketing VP bet everything on 100 target accounts instead of
10,000 leads - and pipeline exploded. The trick was launching messy
ABM campaigns before they were ready, which exposed what actually
worked. Now, BDRs report to marketing, and everyone's compensated on
qualified pipeline, not lead volume. Turns out, companies buy
differently at different sizes, so they tier their approach. However,
the real shift was mental - stop thinking about capturing demand and
start thinking about creating it. 

 FIXING MARKETING'S MISSING MIDDLE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most teams focus on awareness and conversions while ignoring the
messy middle where 80% of leads die. There's never enough content
between "hey check us out" and "buy now" - that trust-building zone
where buyers actually decide. This article breaks down how Ahrefs and
HubSpot fixed this by becoming media companies. Weekly newsletters,
teaching content, and showing up even when metrics look flat. The hard
truth is that most companies won't do this because it takes months to
see results.

 MARK ZUCKERBERG: FACEBOOK'S STRATEGY TAX (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Mark Zuckerberg saw it in 2018 - Instagram was eating Facebook alive.
In this leaked email, he admits they'd been artificially pumping
Instagram's growth by siphoning users from Facebook, and the data from
Japan and Russia showed what happens next. When Instagram usage passes
Facebook, the entire Facebook network collapses. His solution was
radical - stop all promotion between apps, maybe even spin Instagram
off entirely before regulators forced them to. He knew Kevin Systrom
would never agree to slow Instagram's growth, writing "I am skeptical
it is possible to both retain Kevin and do what it takes." 

 THE HOLDING COMPANIES OF OUR HEARTS (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Constellation Software quietly turned $890M into $10.3B by buying 500
software companies since 2012 and never selling them. Now, AI
entrepreneurs are copying this playbook - buying accounting firms and
law offices to force AI adoption from the inside. 

 LOVABLE MAKES $75M IN 7 MONTHS—BUT IS IT NAILING PRICING? (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Lovable hit $75M ARR in 7 months by letting anyone type English and
get working apps. This unlocked a wave of non-technical founders
building SaaS businesses, just like Shopify did for e-commerce.
However, here's where it gets messy - it charges for AI credits that
get consumed mostly upfront during building, then usage drops off.
Worse, successful MVPs often graduate to "real" code and churn.
Lovable is trying to be Shopify for SaaS while pricing like a
construction tool.
