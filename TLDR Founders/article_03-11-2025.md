HEADLINES & TRENDS

 JEROME POWELL SAYS THE AI HIRING APOCALYPSE IS REAL: 'JOB CREATION IS
PRETTY CLOSE TO ZERO.' (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Jerome Powell warns that AI is significantly impacting job creation,
with hiring near zero and major companies citing AI for layoffs. The
Fed cut interest rates to address employment risks amid persistent
inflation, as AI-driven investments and productivity gains benefit
higher-income groups while leaving the broader labor market strained.
This poses a complex policy dilemma for the Fed, balancing between
employment support and controlling inflation. 

 ILYA SUTSKEVER'S DEPOSITION IN MUSK VS. ALTMAN (50 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This transcript features portions of a videotaped deposition from
October 1 involving Ilya Sutskever in a case titled Musk v. Altman et
al. The testimony centers on Sutskever's involvement in the removal of
Sam Altman from OpenAI, including his concerns about Altman's alleged
pattern of dishonesty and undermining executives, which he documented
in a memo for independent board members. 

 MERCOR QUINTUPLES VALUATION TO $10B WITH $350M SERIES C (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Mercor secured $350 million in Series C funding, boosting its
valuation to $10 billion. Felicis Ventures led this round with
participation from Benchmark, General Catalyst, and Robinhood
Ventures. The company, which specializes in providing specialized
experts for AI model training, now plans to expand its talent network,
refine its contractor-client matching systems, and develop new
automation products.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE BOARD MEETING BLUEPRINT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Your first board meeting decides whether you lead or get managed.
This playbook turns updates into operating sessions. Send a tight
board pack 72 hours ahead, frame decisions up front, and run a clear
agenda that separates performance review from real strategy. 

 HOW FOUNDERS CAN NAVIGATE TODAY'S INTEREST RATE LANDSCAPE (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Interest rate hikes have shifted VC focus from rapid growth to
demands for profitability and cash flow. Founders should build
resilience, diversify funding sources, and communicate how they're
adapting to these financial conditions. Understanding economic cycles
and timing fundraising can help navigate the current high-cost capital
landscape. 

 HOW TO EVALUATE A FOUNDING TEAM (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Investors assess founding teams by evaluating backgrounds for
industry experience, complementary skills, and past achievements. They
look for team dynamics that balance technical, operational, and
commercial expertise. Strong teams show execution capability,
adaptability to pivot, and the ability to recruit and retain talent.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TRAFFIC IS NO LONGER A RELIABLE GROWTH METRIC (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Webflow is treating AI discovery like the new homepage, and the
numbers hit hard. 10% of signups now come from LLMs, 91% from ChatGPT,
and those visitors convert at 24%, which is six times Google. Rankings
reshuffle daily so they measure visibility, comprehension, and
conversion while refreshing content fast, mining Reddit, and
structuring FAQs. 

 SERVICENOW'S UGLY UI KEEPS WINNING AND THAT'S THE TELL (4 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Clunky screens keep winning because the real product lives underneath
it. Years of ticket flows, approvals, SLAs, and audit trails are
welded into one place. That weld traps data and habits. Forward
deployed engineers keep closing the last mile customers cannot.
Control Tower grows because nothing in enterprise AI ships without
guardrails. If you try to attack this, do not chase the whole suite.
Take one workflow where value is obvious in weeks, wire into their
records, prove fewer escalations or faster MTTR, then expand sideways.


 A STRANGE DELIGHT (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Anthropic built its AI coding tool with white text on black
background, arrow key navigation, and zero mouse support. Snowflake
spent years perfecting animated menus that slide and unfurl. Everyone
gravitates to the primitive one. The command line puts you close
enough to feel the machine working - watching it tick through tasks,
seeing its relentless speed without JavaScript bloat. dbt probably
succeeded because it started this way too. Thousands of analysts got
their first glimpse into computational power through printed logs
instead of buttons. Comfort rarely creates emotional experiences. The
internet doesn't need more polished minimalism, it needs tools that
remind us computers are physical things we can actually feel.
