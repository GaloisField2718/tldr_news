HEADLINES & TRENDS

 LIAR'S VALUATION (17 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Startups often mislead employees by inflating valuation revenue
metrics like ARR, which can include non-recurring transactions,
obscuring true financial health. Equity offers based on these inflated
valuations can mislead potential employees about their potential
worth. Before joining startups, scrutinize revenue types, valuation
structures, and request full financial transparency to make informed
decisions. 

 THE AVERAGE FOUNDER AGES 6 MONTHS EACH YEAR (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The average age of founders raising capital increases by six months
every year due to AI and B2B industry trends. Older founders dominate
AI as they often have PhDs and industry experience. B2B success relies
on long-established networks and expertise.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Moving into a leadership role means your relationship with fear
shifts. You now have to also help others take risks. Even asking
simple questions can be a great starting point to encourage the people
you are invested in to push themselves. It is important to learn to
spot fear in others so you know when to step in to move things
forward. 

 WHAT'S NEXT AFTER YOU LOSE SOMEONE'S MONEY (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 After losing an investor's money, founders should follow up with
honest self-assessment and feedback requests to preserve relationships
and improve future endeavors. Engaging in open communication with past
investors can mitigate misunderstandings, demonstrate growth, and
possibly spark interest in new ventures. This proactive approach
ensures prior investors can accurately represent the founder to new
potential backers, maintaining the founder's reputation.

 HOW TO SUCCEED AS A SEQUOIA INVESTOR (10 MINUTE READ) [13]

broke it down on Jack Altman's podcast. They go through their voting
system, how they track coverage without fake achievement, why they

 THE BIFURCATION IN THE AI MARKET (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The AI market has split into two. Enterprises are paying for
precision with proprietary models, while consumers are using cheaper
open source models for play. Proprietary providers don't need to
compete on price because they've won the segment that pays. This is
why, despite open source models being significantly cheaper,
proprietary providers haven't lost pricing power.
