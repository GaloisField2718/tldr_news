 GROCERY-ANCHORED COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES COULD MAKE FOR A BREADWINNING
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The only real-estate safer than housing? Grocery stores.

Through good times and bad, people need to eat and shop for
essentials. This makes grocery stores and supermarkets the ideal
commercial tenant if you're looking for a stable, low-risk investment
that has the potential to yield reliable profit in every season.

If you're an accredited investor, you now have an entry point into
this highly lucrative market. First National Realty Partners [4] helps
high net-worth individuals invest in grocery-anchored commercial
real-estate.

→ Over 100 employees with 177 years of combined experience [4] in
real estate investing.

→ $30bn transaction experience.

→ Current tenants include Walmart, Kroger, Target, Publix, Whole
Foods, and Aldi.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 A16Z'S BIG IDEAS FOR 2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 50 a16z partners share their predictions for major innovations in
2025. Top ideas include: AI companions with rich inner worlds, game
tech transforming how businesses operate, on-device AI and multi-modal
databases becoming ubiquitous, stablecoins disrupting traditional
payments as adoption grows, a second wave of "faceless" video creators
leveraging AI, and hyperscale AI compute infrastructure influencing
geopolitical power dynamics. 

 HOW CEOS SHOULD THINK ABOUT GROWTH (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The CEO's real job is deciding what matters most and rallying the
team to get it done. To grow faster, CEOs must pick one of three
levers - creating more opportunities, converting more opportunities,
or reducing churn - and focus relentlessly on improving it. Trying to
fix everything at once leads to an exhausting "just try harder" doom
loop. The best CEOs make a clear bet on the single thing that will
truly move the needle. 

 HIRING PLANS FOR 2025 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Building the right team at the right time is critical for success,
but most companies get hiring wrong by budgeting based on last year's
needs. Zero-based budgeting, carefully selecting the experience level
you need, and quickly removing mediocre performers are keys to
assembling an A-team that fits your company's stage.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EFFORT JUSTIFICATION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 We view outcomes more favorably when we've invested time or effort
into achieving them. Brands can leverage this by requiring effort that
makes the value feel "earned," like Duolingo's rewards system or
Costco's paid memberships. Creating experiences that demand investment
can lead to more satisfied, loyal customers who believe their decision
was worth it. 

 7 PSYCHOLOGICAL DRIVERS OF REFERRAL BEHAVIOR TO ACCELERATE B2B GROWTH
(6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To create successful B2B SaaS referral programs, you must understand
the psychological drivers of referral behavior. Effective programs
cater to "transactional referrers" motivated by tangible rewards while
also considering the social capital they spend by referring.
Meaningful rewards, thoughtful design, and A/B testing are key to
aligning incentives with user motivations. Cello shares proprietary
data and research on best practices to drive sustainable referral
growth. 

 WHY YOU SHOULD LEARN FROM YOUR COMPETITOR'S AD COPIES (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 80% of your ad copy's success lies in the messaging. While marketers
are expected to blend creativity with strategy to come up with ad
copies that drive conversion, they don't always need to start from
scratch. By analyzing competitors' ads, one can uncover valuable
insights into messaging that resonates with the target audience - be
it the tone that works, keywords that convert, or ad spend that is
cost-efficient. This blog provides a structured approach to learning
from your competitors.

 WHY FOUNDER CEOS ARE (PROBABLY) BETTER THAN HIRED GUNS (4 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Founder CEOs demonstrate deep commitment to their startup's vision,
driving innovation and strong IPO performance, but can struggle to
scale. Hired CEOs bring experience and networks, but may disrupt
culture and values if poorly managed. Data shows that founder-led
unicorns have 10-18% higher valuations, and most top recent IPOs had
founder CEOs. Founders invest more in R&D and have greater risk
appetite. Overall, data suggests founders are best for fast-growing
startups, but each case is unique. 

 HOW DOES THE ANATOMY FRAMEWORK RATE THE CURRENT GENERATIVE AI WAVE?
(8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Generative AI significantly impacts all technology stack layers, with
key developments in infrastructure, core platforms, applications,
tools, and ecosystem enablers. Both startups and incumbents drive AI
innovation across hardware and software, meeting surging demand
despite challenges like the "compute crunch." The potential for
generative AI to underpin future innovations remains promising,
evidenced by breakthroughs like solving complex mathematical problems.


 HOW NOTION USED COMMUNITY TO SCALE TO 20M+ USERS (7 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Notion's growth strategy is largely centered on leveraging its
community. It focused on creating a community around its product,
which has helped it grow without heavy reliance on traditional
marketing or sales strategies. Notion emphasized user-generated
content, allowing users to create and share templates, which not only
demonstrated the product's versatility but also fostered a sense of
community.
