HEADLINES & TRENDS

 ELON MUSK SUES SAM ALTMAN AND OPENAI (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Sam Altman. Musk
alleges that OpenAI‚Äôs pursuit of profits through its Microsoft
partnership has led it to abandon its original mission of creating
open-source AI for the betterment of humanity. The lawsuit aims to
compel OpenAI to adhere to its original agreement by open-sourcing
GPT-4, severing ties with Microsoft, and focusing on the public good
rather than benefiting executives and investors. 

 THE AGE OF INCUMBENTS (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 7 of the top 10 companies by market capitalization are pure tech
companies that have disrupted traditional industries with their
software. However, in 2024, better software alone is not enough to
displace existing tech incumbents. AI has opened up new possibilities
with data and incumbents have access to extensive pools of data and
know how to best leverage them. However, there are still reasons not
to lose hope when it comes to displacing incumbents. 

 TEARDOWN OF GEMINI AND GOOGLE‚ÄôS CULTURE (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Gemini was widely criticized for its overly politically correct
responses to prompts. The point of AI tools is not to tell users what
to think but to help them seek out information and make important
decisions. Google should be dominating AI, thanks to its access to
vast amounts of data and engineering resources. However, its greatest
obstacle to AI dominance seems to be a cultural one.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY, WHEN, AND HOW TO INTERVIEW YOUR CUSTOMERS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 We‚Äôve all heard the YC adage: ‚ÄúMake something people want,‚Äù but
how do you actually do that? This author shares her interview guides
for assessing various aspects of a product and its marketing strategy.
By conducting these interviews, you can understand the delta between
your perceived value proposition and competitive differentiation and
how your customers judge your strengths and weaknesses. You might
think your absolute killer feature is X, but if your customers don‚Äôt
value X, it doesn‚Äôt matter. These sorts of insights can help inform
how you position your product moving forward. 

 WHAT STAGE IS YOUR COMPANY REALLY AT? (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article discusses the classic "premature scaling" issue as faced
by an e-commerce company. Initially, the company believed it had
achieved Product-Market Fit due to its rapid user acquisition.
However, it eventually noticed that customer churn was excessively
high. To address this, the company used a framework that involved
mapping the customer journey, conducting experiments, and implementing
strategies, such as adjusting pricing, bundling products, and boosting
engagement, to enhance user stickiness and retention. 

 WHY GRANDFATHERING IN SAAS IS BAD FOR BUSINESS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Startups often initially price low to secure deals, but guaranteeing
perpetual grandfathering can lead to problems in the long run. While
founders may enjoy being generous to early customers, price increases
become inevitable as the company grows and aims for higher revenue
targets. This article offers some useful tips on how to
‚Äúde-grandfather‚Äù your pricing before it‚Äôs too late.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FOUNDERS, DO THE SECONDARY SALE (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Should startup founders be permitted to cash out? Employees, not
investors, should decide if it's fair for founders to profit from
secondary sales and have the opportunity to sell their shares.
Ultimately, company insiders should be the ones to determine whether
the founder's compensation is reasonable. 

 DEAD EQUITY MAKES YOUR COMPANY UNINVESTABLE (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 It can seriously hurt a startup if a co-founder departs when it isn't
prepared. Having significant "dead equity" on your cap table makes it
difficult to bring on new investors looking for clear ownership
targets. Setting up proper vesting schedules for co-founders ensures
that they don't take a large portion of the business with them if they
depart. 

 THE FRAGMENTATION OF SEARCH (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 It is an exciting time for the search industry, with the rise of LLMs
reinventing the way we access and interact with information. LLM-based
search agents provide straightforward answers to questions that were
once challenging to find, eliminating the need for users to sift
through potentially unreliable clickbait articles. This direct method
of accessing information is diverting traffic from search engines like
Google and Bing and displacing web publishers who supply the data
these search agents are trained on.

 KLARNA‚ÄôS AI CHATBOT IS MAKING WAVES (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Klarna announced that its AI chatbot successfully handled 66% of
customer inquiries in just one month. It reportedly performed the work
of 700 employees at five times the speed. 

 THE LAZY WAY TO FIND AN 8-FIGURE STARTUP NICHE (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Upwork is today's Craigslist. In 2014, savvy founders were breaking
up "Craigslist" into many niche vertical marketplaces. Now in 2024,
with the advent of AI SaaS, these founders are doing the same to
Upwork. 

 HOW LLMS ARE CHANGING THE BUSINESS MODEL OF THE INTERNET (2 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 There‚Äôs a paradigm shift in the internet business model, with
revenue from data sales, especially for training LLMs, possibly
surpassing traditional advertising income. This shift raises
considerations about user privacy, data controls, and the future of ad
networks.
