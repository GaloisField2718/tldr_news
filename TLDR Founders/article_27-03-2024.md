STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHEN, AND HOW, TO TALK TO INVESTORS (5 MINUTE READ) [7]

your startup, and the progress you've made. It's important to be
intentional with each data point you create through your investor

The relationships you build with investors will extend beyond their
tenure at a firm.
