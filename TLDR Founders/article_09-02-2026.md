HEADLINES & TRENDS

 HOW MARKETS PRICE AI RISK (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Vertical software stocks are down 43% from their highs. DevTools are
down 21%. The gap doesn't track with which sectors AI can actually
replace - it correlates almost perfectly with growth rates. Slow
growers (8-11%) are getting crushed while faster growers (21-22%) are
holding up. The market isn't pricing in AI disruption. It's pricing in
who can outrun it. 

 CHURN/RETENTION IN THE ERA OF AI (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI companies are fighting churn and facing a retention apocalypse.
The real retention curve starts when the hobbyists leave, leaving only
the people who've integrated AI into actual work. AI churn is higher
because it's easy to buy and cancel, and many trials reflect curiosity
more than long-term commitment. Companies that win move upmarket,
build for habitual workflows, and add services/FDEs on top of AI.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 UPLEVEL OR REPLACE? A CEO'S DILEMMA AT SERIES B (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ZoomInfo was built from $0 to IPO, and its founder has a nuanced take
on the "when do you upgrade your early team" question. His answer:
every exec was a first-timer once, and external hires aren't
automatically better. The real question is whether someone can do what
the business needs for the next 12-24 months, not whether they've done
it before. 

 ENDGAME PLAY (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Modern systems optimize by simulating terminal states, collapsing
openings and middlegames into scripted execution, from chess engines
to modern warfare and AI strategy. This endgame-first reasoning treats
real-world uncertainty as a series of bottlenecks to skip, rewarding
fluency in simulation over engagement with unresolved complexity. The
failure mode emerges when actors mistake the ability to model outcomes
for proximity to them, abandoning the middlegame where risk,
ambiguity, and real consequences still concentrate. 

 TWO MODES OF STORYTELLING: STUDIO AND NEWSROOM (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Studio mode focuses on slow, deliberate storytelling with deep craft
and novel perspectives, producing rare, timeless content that gains
momentum through careful refinement. Newsroom mode prioritizes fast,
responsive storytelling, engaging with ongoing conversations and
surfacing insights while the moment is alive. The most effective
storytellers cycle between the two, letting newsroom responsiveness
inform studio work and studio depth amplify newsroom relevance,
creating a feedback loop that balances craft with timeliness.

MISCELLANEOUS

 YOU CAN BUILD A $10B+ COMPANY FULLY REMOTELY (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 All large companies work remotely - the only people truly working 'in
person' at any of these companies are the ones sitting within earshot.
Everyone else is collaborating through screens. Hire people with
agency who want to work hard. Employees who prefer remote work just
want to do their best work in an environment that suits them. 

 THE INCOMPETENT CONFIDENCE COMPLEX (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Why do we consistently reward confidence over competence, and how
does Dunning-Kruger play out in startups? The best operators don't
start confident - they iterate until they actually know what they're
doing, and the real confidence follows naturally. 

 BOIL THE OCEAN (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The old adage was "don't boil the ocean." With artificial
superintelligence on the horizon, it's time to retire that phrase
entirely. The fear of the future is directly proportional to the
smallness of your ambitions. If your plan is to maintain the status
quo, AI is terrifying. If your plan is to build something dramatically
bigger, it's the best news you've ever gotten. This is Jevons Paradox
for everything: when a resource becomes dramatically more efficient,
you don't use less of it, you use vastly more.
