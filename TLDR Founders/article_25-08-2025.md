HEADLINES & TRENDS

 US TECH-STOCK STUMBLE SHOWS VULNERABILITY IN AI TRADE (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 U.S. tech stocks pulled back sharply with the sector falling 2.5%
this week, led by selloffs of Nvidia and Palantir as investors grow
wary of AI-driven gains. The drop came shortly after the release of
MIT research showing 95% of organizations get no return on AI
investments and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggesting that AI investment
was in a bubble. 

 ANTHROPIC LAUNCHES AI ADVISORY BOARD (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic has formed a Higher Education Advisory Board, chaired by
former Yale president Rick Levin, to guide Claude's development for
teaching and research. 

 AS FUNDING TO AI STARTUPS INCREASES AND CONCENTRATES, WHICH INVESTORS
HAVE LED? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI companies secured $118 billion by mid-August, with funding
increasingly concentrated among eight firms, including OpenAI's $40
billion raise. SoftBank, Greenoaks, and prominent corporate backers
like Meta and Google are driving the largest investments. U.S. venture
industry dry powder is declining, reflecting the intense competition
and high valuations in the AI sector.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE PERFECT PRODUCT PAGES FOR SAAS FOUNDERS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Your homepage alone stops working once your product does more than
two things well - that's when you need dedicated product pages. These
pages sit under 'Product' or 'Solutions' in your nav bar and come in
three flavors: feature pages (how specific features work), use-case
pages (how to accomplish specific goals), and customer-segment pages
(tailored for specific audiences like "for Marketing Teams"). The most
common structure includes a hero, social proof, benefits and features
combo, how it works section, case studies, additional resources, FAQ,
and CTA. 

 STRATEGY & URGENCY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 None of the popular prioritization frameworks (RICE, ICE, or MoSCoW)
explicitly address how time affects value, which is bizarre because
timing is everything in strategy - if you're racing to be first to 30%
market share to "tip" the market, every month matters massively, but
if you're adding upsell features, missing this year just means trying
next year. We've been trained to see urgency as anti-strategic,
associating it with desperate salespeople demanding features or
last-ditch quarterly saves, when actually many companies complaining
about "no strategy" are trapped in regrettable reactive urgency
because the ship sailed years ago. 

 FROM FOUNDERS TO FUNDERS: LESSONS ON SCALING DEEP TECH STARTUPS (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Jesse Coors-Blankenship and Gregg Hill, founders turned VCs, focus on
scaling deep tech companies like SandboxAQ by solving real-world
problems and securing smart capital. They emphasize the importance of
picking investors who understand the technology and leveraging anchor
investors to attract a strong syndicate. Effective scaling requires
educating the market on innovations, aligning vision with execution,
and demonstrating progress through clear milestones.

 WE SHOULD ALL BE DOING LESS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 What would actually happen if you stopped trying to be productive for
just one moment? This writer's therapist asked her that question, and
she became furious because the answer terrified her. She'd turned
creativity from joy into a chain around her neck, clawing for likes
and relevance, measuring worth entirely by output.

CEO. Dohmke plans to guide the transition until the end of 2025 before
pursuing new opportunities.
