 BREX, MSFT, AND FINTECHS CUTTING HEADCOUNT, BUT UNEMPLOYMENT STAYS
LOW (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 There‚Äôs been a lot of layoff headlines so far in 2023. Brex was the
most recent, laying off 20% of its staff. This article argues the
layoffs are the result of two converging trends ‚Äì a drop in venture
funding, particularly in fintech, and a rising cultural force at play
that‚Äôs inspiring companies to run lean and use layoffs as a way to
pivot away from projects or reshape the company. 

 WHAT BIG TECH LAYOFFS SUGGEST FOR THE INDUSTRY (7 MINUTE READ) [19]

growth slowdown. Microsoft is a mature company with pretty solid
predictive capabilities around its revenue forecasts. If Microsoft is

 WHAT TO DO IF YOU‚ÄôRE AN NRR ZOMBIE (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 NRR is a new term defined as a startup that boomed in 2021 and then

hard - this article touches on how to do it.

 HOW TO BE A BETTER MICROMANAGER (2 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Conventional wisdom says you should hire smart people and leave them
to it. Fine if you‚Äôre a well-funded startup that can afford super
smart people, but what if you hire someone who has a little less
experience? This article suggests early micromanagement AKA guidance
is the way and it provides a light framework for you to use. 

 WHAT PRODUCT MANAGEMENT IS REALLY ABOUT (1 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 We sometimes confuse product managers for project managers, but their
job isn‚Äôt to manage product deadlines. The highest value thing they
can do is to continually align business objectives with user needs,
using technology as the glue. 

 STOP ARGUING, START DEBATING (2 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 In the early days of developing an idea, it‚Äôs critical that you
challenge every assumption behind that idea. You need to build a
decision-making framework and the capability to disagree and commit.
Without it, you‚Äôre just arguing in circles. Awareness of whether
you‚Äôre arguing or debating is key to getting things done when the
people involved might disagree.
