HEADLINES & TRENDS

 MISTRAL IS REPORTEDLY IN TALKS TO RAISE $1B (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mistral is negotiating to raise $1 billion from investors like Abu
Dhabi's MGX fund and French lenders such as Bpifrance SACA. The French
AI startup, known for its Le Chat chatbot and open-weight LLMs, has
already raised $1.19 billion, reaching a $6.51 billion valuation.
Mistral is collaborating with MGX and Nvidia to build Europe's largest
AI data center, aligned with the UAE's €50 billion AI investment in
France. 

 SECTION 174 IS REVERSED: ALL US-BASED R&D EXPENSES ARE NOW FULLY
DEDUCTED (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The five-year R&D expense amortization nightmare is over. Congress
just reversed Section 174, meaning you can fully deduct domestic R&D
expenses immediately instead of spreading them over five years. Better
yet, startups under $31M in revenue can get retroactive refunds for
all amortized expenses since 2022. You have one year to file amended
returns for 2022-2024 or take a catch-up deduction in 2025. 

 COREWEAVE ACQUIRES DATA CENTER PROVIDER CORE SCIENTIFIC IN $9B STOCK
DEAL (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 CoreWeave acquired Core Scientific in a $9 billion stock deal,
gaining over a gigawatt of data center capacity for AI workloads. Core
Scientific's GPUs will shift from Bitcoin mining to running generative
AI models. Cloud infrastructure providers are rapidly expanding data
centers to meet AI demands, as shown by OpenAI's recent 4.5-gigawatt
capacity deal with Oracle.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE GRUEN EFFECT (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ever go to Target for toothpaste and leave with $200 worth of stuff?
That's the Gruen Effect - when stores deliberately disorient you to
trigger impulse buys. IKEA's maze-like layout keeps you browsing
longer. Amazon's "related products" send you down rabbit holes.
Notion's surprise feature pop-ups keep you exploring. Over 50% of
purchases are unplanned because when you're disoriented, your brain
stops asking "do I need this?" and starts thinking "ooh, that's nice."


 HOW TO TALK ABOUT YOUR COMPETITION (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Competition proves there's money to be made. This CFO's competitors
burned hundreds of millions educating the market while his company
quietly converted those educated buyers with a Yeti mug marketing
budget. Smart differentiation beats demonization - define yourself on
your terms, not theirs. Be specific about who you serve: "We're built
for teams of five, not five thousand." 

 FEEDBACK CULTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This founder discovered that culture is just three things - who you
fire, promote, and hire. Everything else is corporate theater. At his
startup, every piece of feedback connects to a cultural value that
directly affects those decisions. No vague annual reviews. He gave
feedback 50+ times last year, mostly positive, always tied to specific
behaviors. When promotions depend on documented cultural values, not
politics, people actually start living them.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE OTHER VC BARBELL: ENGAGEMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 VC is splitting into two extremes - funds with 100+ companies doing
"spray and pray" versus those with 20-30 doing deep engagement.
Mathematically, larger portfolios perform better according to recent
analysis. However, that assumes diversification is free, which it
isn't. 

 THE HUNGRY, HUNGRY AI MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI models consume 300x more input tokens than they output - sometimes
up to 4,000x. This founder tested it expecting 20x, but discovered the
shocking reality. Since input tokens cost 98% of your API bill despite
being 4x cheaper per token, the engineering challenge isn't prompting
anymore - it's context engineering. You need efficient data retrieval
that finds the best information in the smallest token footprint.
Caching moves from nice-to-have to mission-critical when 99% of your
tokens are input. 

 MONEY OR DREAMS (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This founder watched dropshipping in 2010 and sees the same pattern
with today's AI wrappers - 16-year-olds hitting $1M ARR in 30 days.
Find a niche, wrap the latest model, and pay TikTok kids for
distribution. Most dropshippers died when Facebook ads got expensive
and consumers caught on. However, Nike “dropshipped” Japanese
shoes for 10 years before making its own. Now everyone wears Nikes.
The takeaway isn't choosing between quick money or building something
generational - you need the money printer to fund the dream.
