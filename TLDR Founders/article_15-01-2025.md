HEADLINES & TRENDS

 ASK HN: PREDICTIONS FOR 2025? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [4] 

 2024 predictions on Hacker News highlight common inaccuracies and
overly optimistic expectations, such as the popularity of Vision Pro,
reflecting community mood rather than realistic outcomes. Discussions
emphasize using Phil Tetlock's disciplined forecasting traits to
achieve better accuracy. Social media and AI predictions persist, with
debates on moderation, economic impacts, and the potential rise of
niche content due to AI advancements. 

 THE ORIGINS OF WOKENESS (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Wokeness - people attracted to moral purity who zealously enforce
social rules - is the latest manifestation of historical priggishness.
Political correctness emerged in universities in the 1980s as 1960s
activists gained tenure, then evolved into modern wokeness accelerated
by social media, changing journalism, and new administrative roles.
Wokeness should be treated like religion - individual expression
should be allowed while institutional enforcement should be prevented
- to avoid future outbreaks. 

 THE PATH OF OUR LIVES (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Steve Blank reflects on his 50-year journey in Silicon Valley through
the lens of a reconnection with an old Air Force friend. The contrast
between their life paths illuminates a key distinction between those
who view life as predestined versus those who actively shape it. While
most people live unexamined lives accepting what comes, entrepreneurs
and change-makers deliberately push against predetermined paths,
choosing instead to make their dent in the universe despite obstacles.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE DEATH OF GLITCH, THE BIRTH OF SLACK (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Glitch's shutdown in 2012 led to the creation of Slack after Stewart
Butterfield and his team repurposed their internal communication tools
into a new product. Although Glitch, a Flash-based game, didn't find
enough players or adapt to mobile, its demise sparked the development
of Slack to streamline team communication by replacing email and
integrating various messaging tools. Within a year, Slack was
launched, eventually leading to its successful public company debut.

 OUR REMEDIES PROPOSAL IN DOJ'S SEARCH DISTRIBUTION CASE (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Google will appeal the DOJ's decision on its search distribution
practices, claiming the tech landscape is competitive, especially with
AI developments. It has proposed remedies that focus on search
distribution, offering more flexibility to browser and device makers
while arguing that DOJ's measures could harm consumers and innovation.

without compromising privacy or global technology leadership. 

 TOWARDS A NEW KIND OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The history of science highlights the significance of thermodynamics
and electromagnetism in modern technology. Thermodynamics, crucial for
energy conversion and chemical reactions, underpins human progress by
enabling heat-based power. Despite advancements, potential
undiscovered laws in non-equilibrium thermodynamics could drive
further innovation, reflecting the need for practical exploration
beyond computational simulations. 

 IDEAS FROM "A PHILOSOPHY OF SOFTWARE DESIGN" (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The first key idea from "A Philosophy of Software Design" highlights
the importance of zero-tolerance for complexity through centralized
logic to prevent change amplification and reduce cognitive load. The
second idea discusses how smaller components don't always improve
modularity and can instead contribute to unnecessary complexity.
Lastly, the book emphasizes minimizing exception handling complexity
by defining errors out of existence, masking exceptions, and
aggregating exception handling.
