HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHY IPOS ARE OVER (FOR NOW) (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 IPOs have effectively vanished from the tech landscape, with
PitchBook data showing virtually no exit activity as market
instability makes going public extremely risky. Despite a brief
recovery after Trump backed off some tariffs, major indices remain
deeply in the red: Nasdaq is down 15% YTD and Cloud and Semiconductor
indices are both approaching -20%. 

 THE INDUSTRIALIZATION OF IT (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Today, a junior engineer still outperforms AI coding models - but the
math is getting uncomfortable. For roughly the same $250,000 annual
cost, you could run Gemini 2.5 Pro continuously for a year and
generate two million coding responses. The real threat isn't smarter
AI - it's the industrialization of software development. Future
companies won't build single brilliant AI engineers, they'll create
coding factories where thousands of agents work in parallel on
compartmentalized codebases designed for machine scale. This isn't
about craft versus automation - it's steam engines versus John Henry.
Like all previous forms of mechanization, the machines won't win
because they're more talented, but because they never stop. 

 THE BOND MARKET (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 While headlines focused on tariffs, the real drama this week was in
the bond market where yields spiked Tuesday night amid fears that
foreign governments were dumping US treasuries ahead of critical bond
auctions. When bond prices fall, yields rise, creating a dangerous
feedback loop where potential buyers demand higher rates to compensate
for risk. Trump's 90-day tariff extension calmed markets just in time,
averting a potential crisis.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 REVENUE COMES SECOND (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Today's vertical AI startups can rack up millions in revenue without
proving they've created lasting value - a dangerous reversal of the
natural order where value creation leads and revenue follows. These
companies become "number go up" machines, mistaking optimization for
validation and scaling without knowing if they have something worth
scaling. Early-stage startups should instead focus on graduating from
one true/false experiment to the next: validate a thing, which unlocks
an opportunity, that can turn into a business. Without this
disciplined approach to proving value creation first, rapid revenue
growth becomes empty calories that eventually run out. 

 DESIGNING SNAPCHAT AND THE FUTURE OF MUSIC (61 MINUTE VIDEO) [8] 

 In this video, Jack Brody, former Head of Product at Snap and current
CPO at Suno, dives into designing in the age of AI and what the future
of music looks like. Brody explores how AI is flipping design on its
head and how it has the capacity to change music forever, making music
creation more accessible than ever before, empowering newbies and
professionals alike. 

 FROM 0 TO 1 BILLION MEETINGS: HOW OTTER.AI BUILT A BOTTOM-UP AI SAAS
WITHOUT A SINGLE SALES REP (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Otter.ai scaled by building its own AI infrastructure and offering a
generous free tier, driving rapid adoption and enterprise penetration.
It utilized work email authentication for data collection and created
natural virality through meeting note sharing. Its horizontal-first
strategy allowed broad market capture, identifying high-value
verticals later, exemplifying a sustainable SaaS growth model.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT INVESTING AT 100X ARR REALLY MEANS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI startups are raising at 100x ARR multiples again, but this math
creates a no-win scenario for founders. If your company is worth $1B
at $10M ARR, investors need you to reach $400M in revenue just to
triple their money, and $1.3B for a 10x return. For context, that puts
you in rarefied air with Reddit and Rubrik. The real danger? Building
a wildly successful $300M business that's still seen as a
disappointment because it couldn't grow into the impossible valuation
it raised on. Founders should ask themselves if they're truly building
the next billion-dollar revenue machine before accepting terms that
make anything less look like failure. 

 SKILLS ARE THE NEW CURRENCY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 As AI makes execution easier for everyone, the real scarcity becomes
uniquely human capabilities - taste, judgment, and originality. We're
entering an era where your skills might be licensed as modular
"plugins" for AI systems. In a world where anyone can create anything,
being deeply, idiosyncratically human becomes the ultimate
differentiator - your approach and decision-making frameworks become
more valuable than what you produce, especially if they go beyond what
generic AI can replicate. 

 THE REAL AI BOTTLENECK: BAD UX (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While companies like Shopify now expect employees to use AI daily,
widespread adoption faces a significant hurdle: poor user experience.
Better design that clearly defines the human's role could transform AI
from an intimidating black box to a natural extension of our work.
