HEADLINES & TRENDS

 VERTICAL SOFTWARE 2.0 (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Vertical software has become more of a thing over the past few years.
These companies build for a singular or niche audience, allowing them
to tailor their offerings. VCs have often pushed back, saying that by
going niche, they're shrinking the market they're selling to. We‚Äôre
still early in vertical software and fintech, adtech, and logistics
support are still relatively untapped opportunities.

READ) [6]

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FIVE ‚ÄúCONS‚Äù TO ADDING A FREE EDITION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A free tier can be a great option for your startup. Companies like
Slack, Zoom, and Canva have had huge success here. However, it‚Äôs not
going to solve all your user acquisition problems. If you don‚Äôt
already have a lot of eyeballs on your website or product, turning on
a free tier won‚Äôt change that. Free tiers are a way to convert the
traffic you already have, but only when you know how to convert the
traffic to paid. 

 GAMIFICATION: A NEW ERA IN WORKPLACE EXPERIENCES (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 As companies of all sizes embrace hybrid work, they‚Äôre turning to
gamification to help boost productivity within certain domains, like
onboarding, training, and collaboration. Gamification attempts to
improve engagement and encourage creativity by adding an element of
fun to the task, like winning awards or completing questions. 

 PICK ONE AND OWN IT (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Here‚Äôs a probing question that invites a useful thought experiment
‚Äì if your company could have only one single advantage over the
competition, what would it be? The answer to this question could have
a cascading impact on your prioritization and competitive positioning.

 We‚Äôre seeing layoffs everywhere in tech, from small startups to
public companies. The primary goal is to cut costs or change the
composition of the business. Here are some signals that might suggest
a layoff is on the way and how you as a founder or executive team can

variables to the extreme. Understanding whether you‚Äôre optimizing or
