 NAVAN'S IPO IS PARTIALLY AI-PREDICTED (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Navan, formerly TripActions, is going public at a $6.9 billion
valuation, well below its private-market peak. Half its customer
support is now handled by an AI agent named Ava, pushing gross margins
from 60 to 72 percent. The company's numbers show what investors want
to see: efficiency through automation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 32 THINGS WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT BUILDING A STARTUP THAT SCALES (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Everyone thinks scaling kills speed, but what if it's the opposite?
When PostHog grew from 11 to 150 people, teams capped at six shipped
faster. One pessimist kills momentum faster than bad code, and
compromising on a hire always backfires. They replaced interviews with
“SuperDays” to see candidates actually work, and built around
simple goals like “ship stuff,” not OKRs. They learned PMF isn't
permanent, agencies disappoint, stretch goals die, and even enterprise
buyers just want fun, human brands. 

 THE FALSE CONSENSUS EFFECT (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Marketers often assume customers think like they do – and pay for
it. The “False Consensus Effect” explains why: we mistake our own
tastes for the norm. Netflix proved the power of testing assumptions
when it dropped House of Cards all at once and watched viewers binge
six episodes in days. Amazon built its empire on A/B tests, not
opinions. Sometimes you're not your customer, so stop building for
yourself. 

 ASSESSING A STARTUP'S DEFENSIBILITY (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Assessing a startup's defensibility focuses on evaluating its
economic moat, product-market fit, and competitive advantage. Key
factors include cost advantages, intangible assets, network effects,
switching costs, and efficient scale for economic moat; strong
retention rates, NPS, and usage metrics for product-market fit; and
intellectual property, team capability, and scalable business models
for competitive advantage. Investors use these criteria to determine
if a startup can sustain market share and scale effectively against
competition.

 THE DISCOMFORT OF FOCUS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 What if focus isn't about discipline but about trust, as in trusting
that saying no won't close doors, it'll open the right ones faster.
Most founders chase breadth to feel safe, but this team learned real
momentum came from committing to one painfully specific ICP. The
paradox was that narrowing created freedom. Once they stopped hedging
and chose, everything else (clarity, conviction, growth) finally
followed. 

 THE EPIDEMIC OF WASTED TALENT (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Most jobs don't need you, they just need someone. Alex McCann argues
that high salaries often mask a deeper cost: companies pay you to
ignore your own potential. He contrasts corporate comfort with a
Colombian birdwatcher who found purpose in work only he could do. The
point isn't to quit tomorrow, but to start creating something that
couldn't exist without you. Being replaceable pays well. Being
irreplaceable matters more. 

 THE DATA PENDULUM SWINGS TO CONSOLIDATION (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The “modern data stack” once promised freedom through
specialization, i.e, tools like Fivetran for ingestion and dbt for
transformation. However, with compute giants Snowflake and Databricks
now controlling 72% of the market's revenue, gravity is pulling
everything back together. Their scale lets them eat margin across the
stack. The Fivetran–dbt merger shows how survival now means scale,
two startups combining to stand a chance as data recenters around the
giants.
