HEADLINES & TRENDS

 TECH SELL-OFF LEADS US STOCKS LOWER AND 10-YEAR YIELD SINKS (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Wall Street took a rollercoaster nosedive, with tech stocks bearing
the brunt. However, it's not just about numbers. This article weaves
together economic data, investor psychology, and geopolitical tensions
to paint a complex picture of market dynamics. The very factors
driving stocks down are simultaneously boosting bonds, creating a
"double-edged sword" for investors. 

 FOUNDER CEOS AT IPO: DO THEY REALLY MATTER FOR STOCK RETURNS? (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Conventional wisdom suggests that founder-led companies perform
better post-IPO. However, Ilya Strebulaev's research turns this notion
on its head. Analyzing 260 unicorns, he found no significant
difference in stock returns between founder-led and non-founder-led
companies at IPO. This counterintuitive finding challenges long-held
beliefs about leadership in high-growth companies.

 WHY YOU CAN'T SELL TO C-SUITE EXECUTIVES (AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT) (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Forget everything you've learned about open-ended questions in sales.
Chris Orlob's analysis of 39,105 deals reveals a shocking truth:
asking too many questions to C-suite executives actually decreases win
rates. His answer is "context-led questions" that demonstrate deep
research and industry knowledge. It's a high-risk, high-reward
technique that could revolutionize enterprise sales approaches.
