 HOW STARTUPS CAN USE CX TO DRIVE BREAK-OUT GROWTH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Dear Founder,

Scaling your startup isn't just about building a great product—it's
about building a great experience. The fastest-growing startups treat
customer experience as a growth engine, not a support function.
Ubiquity shares how early CX investment drives loyalty, retention, and
long-term valuation [4].

In this blog [4], you'll learn how to:

 	* Build CX foundations early to turn customers into advocates.
 	* Use data and feedback loops to sharpen product-market fit.
 	* Design scalable support that grows with your customer base.

See how top founders are leveraging CX to accelerate sustainable
growth. Read more. [4]

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 VENTURE CAPITAL IS NOT COMPETITIVE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Venture capital no longer behaves like a competitive market. The
language of rivalry persists, but the substance has thinned. The same
firms crowd around the same deals, rehearsing the same convictions
until they harden into consensus. Somewhere along the way, the
infinite game became finite. What began as a search for outliers has
become an exercise in pattern recognition. Capital pools, performance
converges, and the illusion of competition masks a quiet retreat from
risk. The question is not who wins this round, but whether there's
still a game being played at all. 

 THE $100B QUESTION: HOW SAAS GIANTS ARE REWRITING THE RULES OF VALUE
WITH AI IN 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SaaS pricing ran on predictability for two decades. Seats and flat
plans made sense when value scaled with people. AI broke that logic -
one agent can do the work of ten, and each query can carry a volatile
compute bill. Companies are now rebuilding their models in real time.
Hybrid pricing buys time but not clarity. Outcome pricing promises
fairness but demands proof. Between the two lies a growing realization
that software was predictable only because the people using it were. 

 SAM ALTMAN ON OPENAI'S REVENUE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's annual revenue run rate has surpassed $20B. Future
infrastructure commitments are reaching $1.4 trillion. The company's
plans include enterprise offerings, AI cloud services, and ventures
into consumer devices and scientific discovery.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW YOU.COM SURVIVED CHATGPT WITH A PIVOT TO ENTERPRISE AI (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 You.com shifted from consumer search to enterprise AI, offering
search APIs and complex data analytics to businesses following
ChatGPT's launch. Competing with Google and others in the AI market,
You.com leverages its own search infrastructure to deliver detailed
reports and agent-based solutions like business analytics and
financial analysis. The company also introduced Auto Mode for
integrating multiple LLMs and secured $100M in VC funding to expand
its agent-centric services. 

 WHY OPENAI WANTS A PIECE OF AMD (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI will buy up to 6 GW of AMD GPUs, starting with 1 GW of MI450
in H2 2026, and get $0.01 warrants for up to 160M shares that vest
with 1–6 GW deployments and other milestones, potentially reaching
~10% ownership. It chose AMD because Nvidia supply is tight and
pricey, AMD claims MI450 will beat current Nvidia parts, and AMD's
smaller base trades equity for multi‑GW orders. Monetization trails
GPU demand, especially in video, and tariff‑driven inflation cuts
rate‑cut odds, raising downside risk for AI‑levered names. 

 LOOK FOR YES (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Product and legal teams often clash due to misunderstood risk levels.
Risk managers should ensure their advice isn't seen as an absolute
veto but rather as guidance by framing context and trade-offs. Product
managers need to actively seek solutions to legal concerns, aiming for
responsible risk-taking rather than defaulting to "no."

 THE LOST ART OF CRYING (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Former Facebook VP Julie Zhuo just wrote the most vulnerable thing
you'll read about founder psychology this year. She reveals how
Silicon Valley's "ice queen" culture (the obsession with logic,
optimization, and emotional control) is actually a fear response, not
a superpower. As AI takes over rational work like calculations and
planning, the only irreplaceable human skill is our ability to truly
feel: grief, awe, connection, vulnerability. Zhuo discovered this
through what she calls "Big Cries" using music and solitude, and
argues that in an era where we're building superhuman machines,
learning to cry again isn't weakness but reclaiming the last thing AI
can never touch. 

 THE INTERNET WANTS TO BE FRAGMENTED (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The social media empire is crumbling, and Gen Z is leading the
exodus. Nearly half of Gen Z plans to spend less time on social
networks in 2025, abandoning the "town square" platforms for intimate
Discord channels, DMs, and curated feeds. The big experiment of
throwing humanity into one digital room failed. This shift back to
small, self-selected communities is a massive opportunity for builders
creating tools for micro-communities instead of trying to be the next
Twitter.
