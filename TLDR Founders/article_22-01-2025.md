HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE FIVE EXECUTIVE ORDERS YOU NEED TO KNOW (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Trump's first-day executive orders - attempting to end birthright
citizenship despite constitutional protections, reviving Schedule F to
enable civil service dismissals, pardoning January 6 rioters, and
launching investigations into the Biden administration - signal major
policy shifts. While some orders face clear legal hurdles, others,
like Schedule F, create tools whose impact depends on implementation.
This piece examines how each order tests different aspects of
democratic institutions. 

 WHAT DEEPSEEK'S MODEL MEANS FOR AI (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DeepSeek's new open-weights R1 model, trained on a modest budget,
points to an emerging split in AI development: high-speed models for
immediate tasks versus research models for complex reasoning. Download
data shows strong market interest in both approaches. AI is
bifurcating between quick, lightweight models and more deliberate
thinking engines, with each serving distinct use cases. 

 FINDING PURPOSE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In 1958, Hunter S. Thompson wrote a profound response to a friend
seeking life advice. Rather than pursuing fixed goals that shift as we
grow, he argues we should strive to be ourselves by choosing paths
that maximize our abilities and desires. The letter emphasizes that
the journey matters more than the destination - "look for a way of
life" instead of specific goals. When standard options feel limiting,
Thompson urges, "you must find a ninth path."

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 $500 FOR ONE COLOR?! (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 RemoteOK has turned job postings into a money machine through smart
upsells. Companies willingly pay $500 for custom colors and
highlighted listings to stand out in a crowded market. The strategy
works by preselecting premium options and using loss aversion -
unselecting features triggers warnings about missed opportunities.
Average revenue per job post "skyrocketed" after RemoteOK implemented
these psychology-driven pricing tactics. 

 WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT AI FROM 7 ACTIVE STARTUP INVESTORS THIS YEAR (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI companies saw a significant funding increase totaling $99.6
billion in 2024. With a focus on both foundation models and applied AI
sectors, investors are increasingly interested in AI applications with
impactful sector-specific benefits, moving beyond mere infrastructure
investments. While AI funding is up, experts anticipate a decade-long
maturation period for AI's full potential in transforming software
development and business processes.

 THE MOST POWERFUL TAX BREAK IN AMERICA (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 QSBS tax exemptions let startup founders, employees, and investors
pay zero federal taxes on up to $10M in gains or 10x their initial
investment. This piece details key requirements like holding shares
for 5 years and having less than $50M in assets, while revealing how
founders use trusts and gifting strategies to multiply their exemption
beyond the base $10M limit. One founder managed to shield over $100M
using these techniques. 

 HOW WE MAKE MONEY HERE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Most employees don't understand their company's revenue model,
creating misaligned decisions across teams. This article outlines a
framework for explaining business models on day one: who pays, what
they pay, when they get paid, market size, and future opportunities.
Engineers react differently when they learn they're working on
products generating millions in revenue - knowledge breeds motivation
and agency.
