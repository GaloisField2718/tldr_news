 Microsoft reported a significant increase in its fiscal third-quarter
revenue, reaching $61.9 billion, a 17% rise, with profits up 20% to
$21.9 billion, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The growth was
driven by a 31% increase in Azure cloud services revenue,
significantly boosted by AI technologies, including the Azure OpenAI

outcomes across various industries.

 Rubrik, a Microsoft-backed data security firm, went public on
Thursday, joining other significant IPOs this year and reigniting
discussions about the revitalization of the IPO market. Despite a more

 MATTERPORT IS BEING ACQUIRED BY COSTAR AT A 212% PREMIUM (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Matterport, a digital twin platform, has agreed to be acquired by
CoStar, one of its customers, in a cash-and-stock deal valuing the
company at approximately $1.6 billion. The acquisition is expected to

Matterport's virtual tour technology, but the deal is subject to
regulatory approvals, which could potentially derail the transaction,
as seen in CoStar's previous attempt to acquire RentPath.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE RULE OF 20+20 (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 SaaS companies may receive better acquisition offers in the current
market by focusing on moderate growth and profitability instead of
rapid growth at the expense of the bottom line. The "Rule of 20+20"
states that companies with 20-30% growth and 10-20% profit margins are
more attractive to buyers than those solely focused on growth or
profitability.

revenue-focused metrics will dominate B2B marketing strategies.

 IN CONFLICT, YOU'RE NOT AS RATIONAL AS YOU THINK (5 MINUTE READ) [17]


 People often believe they are the most logical and objective in a
conflict, but this is due to their own biases and values influencing
their reasoning. To truly understand the other side's perspective and
find common ground, one must practice empathy, avoid quick judgments,
and examine their own biases. 

 SAAS METRICS FOR FUNDRAISING (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Fundraising for your SaaS startup can be chaotic, but one thing you

prepare for fundraising by highlighting the key metrics investors care
about, such as ARR growth, customer acquisition costs, lifetime value,
and retention rates. It also emphasizes the importance of building a

story through data.
