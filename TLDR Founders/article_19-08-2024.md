HEADLINES & TRENDS

 HOW TO HIRE A CTO (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hiring the right CTO is critical for a tech startup's success, as
they set the technical vision, build the product, and influence the
company's culture. When searching for a CTO, it's important to assess
their stage appropriateness, technical credibility, hiring and
management skills, and mission fit through a structured interview
process that includes coding exercises, architecture discussions, and
reference checks. 

 ERIC SCHMIDT'S AI PROPHECY (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO, believes that AI will rapidly
evolve in the next couple of years, enabling entrepreneurs to quickly
build and iterate on digital products like a TikTok competitor.
Despite his extensive knowledge and experience in the field, Schmidt
admits to revising his AI outlook every six months due to the
unprecedented speed, scale, and potential disruption of AI
development. 

 SCIENCE FICTION'S DUELING FATES (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In recent years, science fiction has increasingly focused on
dystopian futures, painting bleak pictures of the world without
offering many solutions. This trend is in stark contrast to older
sci-fi works that explored complex themes and ideas while still
maintaining a sense of hope and possibility. To inspire real-world
progress, science fiction should strive to be more solution-oriented,
using its boundless creative potential to imagine realistic ways of
addressing the pressing issues facing humanity today.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BUILDING 0 TO 1 PRODUCTS AND THE INSIDE STORY OF FIGMA SLIDES (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mihika Kapoor, product lead at Figma, shares her journey of
developing Figma Slides from concept to a featured product. She
emphasizes the importance of building prototypes to generate
excitement and buy-in, aligning products with company goals, and
leveraging user feedback to refine ideas. Mihika also discusses her
unconventional approach of not writing PRDs, preferring to use designs
as the primary source of truth for product development. 

 LAUNCHING AND ITERATING YOUR PRICING MODEL (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When launching a product, selecting the right value metric is crucial
for effective pricing. This metric should match the customer's needs,
be easily understood, and grow alongside the customer, avoiding the
common mistake of copying competitors. Having a framework to iterate
on pricing over time is essential, as demonstrated by HubSpot's
successful use of the number of contacts as a value metric, which
aligns with customer growth and justifies its pricing strategy. 

 IT'S NOT JUST B2C VERSUS B2B ANYMORE (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article discusses the author's experience with their podcast
hosting platform, Transistor, and how they initially targeted B2B
customers but later expanded to serve a broader range of users,
including hobbyists and prosumers. The author argues that the
traditional B2C and B2B categories are too simplistic and that many
SaaS products can successfully cater to multiple customer segments
simultaneously, an approach they call "B2Many."
