 BOT ATTACKS ARE EVOLVING. IS YOUR APP READY? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Modern bots behave like real users [5]. They execute JavaScript,
rotate IPs, and solve CAPTCHAs with AI. Traditional detection tools
can't keep up.

WorkOS Radar [6] stops abuse at the source. Just one API call blocks
bots, brute force attacks, and free trial abuse without slowing down
real users.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 MIRA MURATI'S THINKING MACHINES LAB RAISES $2B AT $12B VALUATION (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 With no revenue or products, the former OpenAI CTO's startup landed
one of the largest seed rounds ever from Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia,
and others. Two-thirds of the team are former OpenAI employees. 

 COGNITION ACQUIRES WINDSURF (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cognition scooped up Windsurf's remaining 250-person team and $82
million ARR business after Google's $2.4 billion reverse-acquihire
cherry-picked only the leadership, leaving employees behind without
payouts. The acquisition gives Cognition both AI coding agents and IDE
capabilities to compete with Cursor's $500 million ARR, and restores
Windsurf's access to Claude models that Anthropic had cut off amid
rumors of an OpenAI acquisition. 

 VOXTRAL: MISTRAL'S OPEN-SOURCE AUDIO MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Mistral's Voxtral is the company's first open-source audio model
suite. It features a 24B parameter model for large-scale use and a 3B
variant for edge deployment.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EMAILS FOR HUMANS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 People in the 1200s would think email is magic - instant messages to
anyone, anywhere. What do we use it for? Work messages, ads, and
password resets. We should send more thoughtful emails to strangers.
Bad emails ask for general life advice or "30 minutes to Zoom." Good
ones are specific - share an interesting essay, ask one focused
question, or just say hello. Email B beats Email A because it's
honest, specific, and includes something useful. Most people send zero
cold emails to interesting strangers. Maybe you should send more. 

 DESIGN PARTNERSHIPS IN VERTICAL AI (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Vertical AI founders gathered to share what works. Getting design
partners? Just ask for advice - executives love giving it. The sweet
spot is 5-10 partners, mixing cold and warm contacts. Pick big names
in your field (Turner in construction turns heads). Be picky with
early partners because they become your first referrals. 

 FROM MEMO TO MOVEMENT (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Shopify's CEO told everyone to use AI. What happened next surprised
them. Support staff, not engineers, became the biggest power users.
The company gives everyone unlimited access to expensive models - no
budgets, no limits. One person spent $10K in a month, and nobody
blinked. It is hiring more interns because students already work with
AI naturally. The wildest part? A sales rep built a tool in Cursor
that changed how they sell. AI revealed that their whole process was
backwards.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BUILD, SELL, UNDERSTAND (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Every startup job boils down to three things: building the product,
selling to customers, or understanding what to do next. Engineers
build, salespeople sell, analysts understand. Some roles blend them
(growth does building plus selling). Here's what most people miss:
everyone eventually becomes a seller. Managing, recruiting, and
working cross-functionally all require convincing people. 

 UNIFY RAISES $40M TO TURN GROWTH INTO A SCIENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Unify just raised a $40M Series B from Battery, OpenAI, Thrive,

in the last year. Its customers include Airwallex, Perplexity, and
Cursor. 

 NEUROTECH IS HAVING ITS 2017 AI MOMENT (1 MINUTE READ) [20]

mainstream awareness, and a tight insider community. This post
highlights a new market map detailing competing approaches, top
projects, and tradeoffs to demystify the space.
