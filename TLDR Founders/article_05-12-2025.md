 STATE OF PRIVATE MARKETS: EARLY-STAGE VALUATIONS ARE BACK WITH A
VENGEANCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Venture looks completely different than it did in 2023. In Q3 2025,
startups on Carta [4] raised the highest quarterly sum of new funding
in three years. 

And that's in line with industry-wide trends. After the reset in tech
valuations, founders have raised more total cash with each passing
quarter. Mega-deals, sometimes worth billions of dollars, brought
volume up substantially.

Read the Q3 2025 State of Private Markets [4] report to learn why
early-stage valuations keep rising, down rounds are declining, and the
bay area is still outperforming NY, Boston, and LA combined.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE STATE OF AI (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The past year in AI has seen rapid shifts in capability, adoption,
and developer behavior. These changes have reshaped how we build and
interact with intelligent systems. This post looks at a new study that
examines these changes through more than 100 trillion tokens of
real-world model usage from OpenRouter. The goal of the study was to
provide a large-scale empirical picture of what people do with AI
today and what that tells us about the future of the industry. 

 A COMMENTARY ON THE GENERAL PHENOMENON OF BEST-IN-CLASS GROWTH
COMPANIES RAISING SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS AT HIGHER AND HIGHER VALUATIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Most of the financing for best-in-class growth companies raising
successive rounds at higher and higher valuations makes no sense.
Growth equity capital is very expensive. Companies at this scale
typically deploy a substantial majority of their expensive equity
dollars into highly predictable, relatively low-risk GTM initiatives.
The capital is being used inappropriately, and these companies should
finance their GTM investments differently.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 VERCEL'S AI SALES AGENT: 10 SDRS DOWN TO 1 IN SIX WEEKS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Vercel enabled its salespeople to spend most of their time with
customers by transforming its inbound sales team. It used an AI sales
representative to respond and analyze leads, which condensed the
number of touches it took to convert. AI enabled quicker responses,
creating an unexpected advantage. Increasing human contact means
salespeople can develop deeper relationships and drive more success
for customers. 

 TRANSPARENT LEADERSHIP BEATS SERVANT LEADERSHIP (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A servant leader quickly becomes an overworked single point of
failure. Once they leave, there is nobody else who knows how to handle
the obstacles the leader moved out of the way for everyone. A good
leader coaches people, connects people, teaches methodical problem
solving, and explains values and principles embraced by the
organization. They create direct links between supply and demand and
allow their direct reports to grow their careers. Good leaders are
continuously training their replacements and generally make themselves
redundant.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BECOMING GREAT AT LISTENING (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Your job as a listener is to consume decades of someone else's
experience in minutes. This is impossible if you are busy mentally
scripting your reply. The secret to world-class communication is to
treat listening and thinking as mutually exclusive states. Turn off
your analysis engine completely while they speak. When they finish,
ask for a "thinking pause." That awkward silence is the only way to
truly synthesize reality before you act on it. 

 THINK FIRST, AI SECOND (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 We are starting to see the long-term cognitive cost of "AI First"
workflows: our brains are literally disengaging. An MIT study found
that students who used AI at the start of a task showed lower neural
activity and memory retention than those who did the work themselves.
The fix is not to ban AI, but to change the sequence. Always force
yourself to draft the structure or outline before you open the prompt
window. By treating AI as a "Devil's Advocate" that critiques your
existing thoughts rather than a generator to create them, you keep
your cognitive edge while still leveraging the speed of the model.

 API-BENCH V2 (3 MINUTE READ) [16]

debugging.

READ) [17]

 LOUD ISN'T ENOUGH (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 You cannot displace a giant with a spreadsheet, you have to turn
their entire existence into a moral problem.
