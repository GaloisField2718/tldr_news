HEADLINES & TRENDS

 ONE YEAR AFTER SVB, THE THRONE SITS EMPTY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The venture debt market has not yet identified a clear successor one
year after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which held
almost 50% of VC-backed tech and life science company accounts in
2022. Many startups turned to non-bank lenders in the aftermath to
avoid risks associated with traditional banks. They're now returning
back to banks, but there is still no clear standout. 

 GLOBAL VC FUNDING HOLDS STEADY BUT AI FUNDING INCREASES (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Global venture capital funding remained steady at around $20 billion
in February. AI companies secured a large portion of the investments.
Industry giants such as Microsoft and Alibaba placed significant bets
on AI startups, driving the sector's share of the total funding to
over 20%. While overall funding has cooled off since 2021, there is
growing optimism (and concern) regarding the valuations of AI
companies. 

 BEYOND ACQUIRES ZULILY FOR $4.5M WITH PLANS TO RELAUNCH THIS YEAR (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Zulily, an online retailer that faced a shutdown and layoffs in the
past year, is being bought by Beyond (formerly Overstock) for $4.5
million in cash. As part of the deal, Beyond, which is led by Marcus
Lemonis, star of the reality TV show "The Profit", will acquire
Zulily's website, domain names, trademarks, customer database, social
media accounts, and software. Zulily's was valued at around $4 billion
after its IPO around a decade ago.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ONBOARDING EMAILS THAT ACTUALLY WORK (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A simple yet effective strategy to improve customer activation
through education is to send an onboarding email series highlighting a
different product feature each day for the first 7 to 30 days. This
approach has been successful for companies like Dropbox, Superhuman,
and Notion. 

 LESSONS ON MARKETING FROM COSTCO (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Great marketing machines are like Costco. There is no one secret to
making them work. Instead, it's a combination of about 50 little
things all working together. You have to build marketing programs out
from a core of ongoing, proven programs to the edges of new,
experimental campaigns. 

 PIVOTING TO A BILLION DOLLAR IDEA (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Wei Deng's journey with Clipboard Health shows that founding a
billion-dollar startup idea often requires multiple pivots. Pivoting
and switching ideas isn't a sign of failure ‚Äî it's a necessary part
of the process as you dig deeper to uncover real, painful problems
your startup can solve. Embracing pivots and staying resilient can
lead to game-changing businesses.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BUILDING AN ENTERPRISE-GRADE GENAI PRODUCT (27 MINUTE PODCAST) [14] 

 May Habib, CEO of Writer, shares her perspective on founding a GenAI
company before the ChatGPT craze, building an enterprise-grade product
and go-to-market motion with 200% NRR, and whether retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) and vector databases even have a role in the
enterprise. 

 THE RISE AND FALL OF FAST.CO (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Fast was a company that was founded in 2019. It managed to raise $100
million in 2021. However, just 16 months later, it was gone. It's hard
to believe that it managed to spend such a massive amount of money in
such a short period of time with 400 staff. The story of Fast
perfectly represents the ZIRP era. There are some important lessons to
be learned from it. 

 THE PATTERN SEEKING FALLACY (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 We all do it - we all look for patterns. As humans, we tend to look
for patterns everywhere, even in random data. However, this tendency
can sometimes lead to misinterpretations, especially in marketing
data. To avoid this, businesses should form a theory based on observed
patterns and then specifically test that theory.

QUICK LINKS

 2024 IS STILL THE YEAR OF EFFICIENCY (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In 2024, the best-in-class SaaS companies generate around $300k in
revenue per employee before going public. The average revenue
generated per employee was less than $100k in 2021. The baseline
expectation has increased, forcing companies to be more efficient in
their operations while still achieving rapid growth. 

 BIGGER ISN‚ÄôT ALWAYS BETTER (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 In the competitive startup landscape, focusing on a defined niche,
rather than trying to outdo competitors by raising more money and
tackling larger TAMs, can lead to unique success by meeting specific
market needs effectively. 

 SAAS VALUATION MYTHS (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 If you're under $5M ARR and not a rocket ship, expect 5-15x EBITDA,
not sky-high revenue multiples. Ignoring this could limit your exit
options down the line.
