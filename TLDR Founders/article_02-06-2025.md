HEADLINES & TRENDS

 BOND CAPITAL RELEASES COMPREHENSIVE 340-SLIDE REPORT ON AI TRENDS (90
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This analysis from VC Mary Meeker's documents unprecedented AI
adoption rates, with ChatGPT achieving global penetration in three
years compared to the internet's 23-year timeline. The report shows
that AI chatbots are now being mistaken for humans 73% of the time (up
from 50% six months ago), inference costs have plunged 99% since 2022,
and enterprise adoption is accelerating beyond experimental phases. 

 GOOD WRITING (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Writing that sounds good is more likely to be right. That claim might
seem absurd, but it's true. When you're forced to rewrite awkward
sentences, you never make the ideas less accurate because you can't
bear to. Any change has to improve both the sound and the truth, like
shaking a bin of objects until they pack together perfectly. 

 MOATS IN THE AGE OF AI (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Speed is the only moat that matters now. What used to be a 12-month
product head start is now 3 prompts and a wrapper. The first LLM-based
CRMs got swarmed, AI note-taking tools were cloned endlessly, and
infrastructure plays saw differentiation collapse overnight.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 VOICE-FIRST PLAYBOOKS IN VERTICAL AI (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Voice AI is moving beyond transcription into conversational agents
that could redefine software entirely. Most companies are using voice
as "wedge products" in specific industries - starting with high-value
workflows like booking appointments or qualifying leads, then
expanding into full systems. Voice removes the bottleneck by letting
people operate in their "native tongue" instead of learning software
interfaces. 

 CLARITY OF THOUGHT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 One phrase comes up over and over when identifying excellent
founders: "clarity of thought." The best founders can see clearly what
doesn't yet exist and articulate it with precision. They start with
obvious assumptions, build a framework for understanding the problem,
then present a clear idea without getting distracted. When done right,
this takes 2-3 minutes and makes investors feel like the founder has
thought of everything - even questions they can't answer yet fit
neatly into their mental framework. 

 IT MAY BE EASIER TO SELL A SECOND PRODUCT TO NEW CUSTOMERS, NOT
EXISTING ONES (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Selling a second product to new customers may be easier than selling
to existing ones. New customers often don't need to switch from an
existing solution, making them more receptive. Allocate resources to
market second products to new prospects for potentially higher attach
rates.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 THE AI PRODUCTIVITY SHIFT IS REAL (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Where is AI delivering measurable ROI - and to whom? Hubstaff
answered this question based on a survey of 3,000 professionals and
millions of hours tracked. The results reveal far-ranging impacts on
productivity, salaries and more. See the data [11], or get deeper
insights by watching the recorded expert panel [10]. 

 SUNFLOWER (TOOL) [12] 

 Focus-first email OS that filters noise. 

 MUREX (TOOL) [13] 

 Amurex is an open-source AI companion that connects your tools to
organize, search, and retrieve workflow insights with full data
control. 

 THE SWARM (TOOL) [14] 

 The Swarm is a relationship intelligence platform that maps and
combines your team's networks to reveal warm intros, helping you close
deals faster through trusted connections.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ON MANAGEMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A startup founder learned the hard way that management isn't therapy
after vulnerability exercises nearly destroyed his company. Startups
need professional sports coaches, not Little League coaches who focus
on everyone feeling good. Pro coaches have one job - winning - and
they'll bench players who don't perform. At startups, nobody gets
promoted unless the company grows, so being too nice to
underperformers kills everyone's career prospects. 

 THE SKILL I'M HIRING FOR IN 2025 AS A CEO (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A CEO who's hit targets for 9 straight quarters says the most
shocking thing isn't that AI is changing everything - it's how fast
his hiring criteria changed. Six months ago he wouldn't hire fresh
grads. Now he hired one because traditional experience means nothing
when nobody's done this before. He wants people who can absorb change
without freaking out, then come back with a concrete plan within
hours. 

 SIERRA VENTURES ON THE 5 LAYERS OF AI STARTUP INVESTMENT (4 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Sierra Ventures seeks AI startups that address significant pain
points and offer efficiency improvements using a five-layer "layered
cake" investment framework. It focuses on applied infrastructure,
horizontal and vertical applications, and novel innovations, excluding
foundational infrastructure. Successful AI startups possess unique
perspectives and utilize product-led growth. Generative AI will create
significant value in the coming decades.
