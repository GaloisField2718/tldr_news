 OPENAI'S MONETIZATION BLUEPRINT FOR THE AI ERA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When Sara Conlon joined OpenAI, each product team managed its own
billing logic. The result was duplicated effort, inconsistency, and
technical fragility. 

Conlon changed that by creating the Financial Engineering team and
centralizing billing for the whole company. At Monetize 2025, she sat
down with Metronome to explain how she built a billing org for
hypergrowth [4].

Read the blog [4] for key insights, including:

 	* The evolution of billing teams in 3 stages: Survival, Advising,
and Proactive
 	* Why embedded monetization code causes outages, and how
platformized billing solves this
 	* Designing systems to expand with new models

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 PATIENT CAPITAL WILL EAT THE WORLD (25 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Venture capital has grown into massive funds like Andreessen Horowitz
and Sequoia, but the traditional VC model struggles with today's
software and AI markets. Growth-stage software no longer requires or
generates capital in the way early SaaS or consumer internet companies
did, and AI companies increasingly need infrastructure financing, not
conventional venture funding. Institutional VC is constrained by LP
mandates, fund timelines, and deployment expectations, forcing
investment even when better opportunities would be to wait. As a
result, funds invent narratives to justify current positions while
real liquidity remains scarce due to limited IPOs and conservative M&A
markets. 

 YC SPRING 2026 REQUESTS FOR STARTUPS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 YC published a list of 10 startup areas it wants to fund this spring.
The themes span AI-native workflows replacing legacy software,
stablecoins as financial infrastructure, and modernizing heavy
industry and government. Notable entries include "Cursor for PMs,"
AI-native agencies, and modern metal mills.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FINDING GTM ALPHA (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 'Alpha' is an investment's outperformance over a market benchmark. It
is what separates market-beating investors from the rest. GTM alpha
starts with having better data than your competitors. Unique data is a
competitive edge. Top teams stay ahead by experimenting, learning, and
launching better plays faster. 

 WHEN TO RAISE VC (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Venture capital requires extremely high returns, often 50x, which
rules out businesses in small or focused markets that can still
generate strong profit and exits. Forcing a VC narrative onto a
business misaligned with hypergrowth pressures leads to wasted time
and compromised product decisions. Founders should match their
financing strategy to market opportunity, using angels or
bootstrapping for steady growth and VCs only when capital materially
changes outcomes. 

 HOW TO BUILD AI PRODUCT SENSE (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Product managers and founders can develop AI intuition by using tools
like Cursor for non-technical work. This interactive guide walks
through practical exercises that help you understand AI capabilities
and limitations firsthand. The best way to know what AI can do for
your product is to experience it yourself rather than relying on demos
or documentation.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 MOLTBOOK (TOOL) [10] 

 moltbook is a social network for AI agents where agents can share,
discuss, and upvote content. Humans can observe, but the platform is
designed for agent‑to‑agent interaction. 

 POLYVIA (TOOL) [11] 

 Polyvia is a Visual Knowledge Index that turns large collections of
images into a queryable, disambiguated source of truth for multimodal
agents and knowledge workflows. 

 HUGO (TOOL) [12] 

 Hugo is an AI support teammate that resolves customer tickets
autonomously, reducing support workload while maintaining quality
responses.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WE NEED MORE ANGEL INVESTORS (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Founders drive more economic value. However, they don't create value
in a vacuum - they need angel investors for capital. AI might make
things cheaper, but that doesn't change the need for capital, only how
it is used. Early capital from angel investors results in more viable
companies that are more likely to succeed. 

 THE ECONOMICS OF A SUPER BOWL AD (15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Ro ran its first Super Bowl ad featuring Serena Williams to boost
brand awareness for its GLP-1 products. The fully loaded cost
including media, production, talent, and additional spend is
$16–29M. Success is measured both short-term through customer
acquisition and traffic spikes, and long-term through brand awareness
and marketing efficiency. The upside is asymmetric and compounding
while downside is capped. Ro chose this moment because the product is
ready, the market is large and underserved, and Serena's story aligns
with the brand.

 WE'VE BEEN QUIETLY BUILDING OUR OWN 0 -> 1 REVENUE STACK INTERNALLY
AT @TRYRAMP - RAMP REVENUE (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sellers at Ramp don't have to worry about switching between dozens of
systems just to figure out who they should reach out to or what they
should say. 

 AI'S IMPACT ON 2026 BUDGETS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 CFOs are opening budgets for AI tools that promise productivity
gains, but the bar for traditional SaaS spend is rising as every new
purchase must compete with the perceived ROI of AI alternatives. 

 WHICH AI LAB IS WINNING THE ENTERPRISE? (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 OpenAI and Anthropic are emerging as key players in the enterprise AI
sector, with Anthropic reportedly gaining ground on OpenAI.
