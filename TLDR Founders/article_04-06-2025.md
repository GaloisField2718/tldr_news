HEADLINES & TRENDS

 VCS ARE FUNDING TWO THINGS RIGHT NOW (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The venture market has stratified: 66% of all VC dollars now go
evenly to AI and DeepTech, while everything else is down 63% from
peak. AI companies are scaling absurdly fast - ChatGPT hit $4B in
revenue and 800M users since 2022, while some startups grow 10% per
week. Meanwhile, DeepTech is finally viable because mega funds can
hold companies forever and the capital requirements are massive. 

 A CHIEF AI OFFICER WON'T FIX YOUR AI PROBLEMS (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Appointing a Chief AI Officer often fails to address the underlying
issues of AI integration in companies. Effective AI adoption requires
embedding AI across all departments rather than isolating it under a
single leader. Organizations should focus on fostering AI literacy and
collaboration across existing leadership roles for sustainable
transformation. 

 THOMA BRAVO'S RECORD $34.4B FUNDRAISE: GREAT NEWS FOR B2B AND SAAS
FOUNDERS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Thoma Bravo's record $34.4 billion fundraise positions it as the
largest software-focused investor, spotlighting opportunities for
profitable, high-growth B2B and SaaS companies. Its focus on
mid-market SaaS via the Discover Fund and a buy-and-build strategy
signals increased consolidation and liquidity events. This capital
influx underscores software's status as a lucrative investment sector,
though the demand for quality and sustainable unit economics has
intensified.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MORE OR LESS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There are three viable pricing strategies you must pick and fully
commit to. "More for more" means luxury pricing - you're genuinely the
best at something specific and charge accordingly. "More for less"
captures most markets by offering high ROI without luxury frills.
"Less for less" means rock-bottom prices where customers accept major
trade-offs because the alternative is having nothing at all. The only
wrong choice is not choosing at all. 

 HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU INVEST IN CUSTOMER SUCCESS? (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Snowflake famously has no Customer Success team because everyone owns
the customer, but most companies with mere mortal retention rates need
dedicated CS teams. The question is how much to invest. The Customer
Success Ratio offers a framework: CS Investment divided by Net
Expansion Dollars. If you're a $10M ARR company targeting 110% net
retention, that's $1M in net expansion - making a $1M CS investment
rationale for breakeven, with upside as customers stick around
creating an annuity stream. 

 A FOUNDER'S GUIDE TO PRODUCT VELOCITY (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 People often confuse product velocity with shipping fast, but it's
actually about shipping value. In this post, StartPlaying's founder
shares their journey through building "Starter Set," a quiz for new
D&D players. They did rigorous research including fake credit card
tests, focused on perfecting the "happy path" for 90% of users while
keeping backend systems scrappy, and improved conversion by 119%
through A/B testing. Despite months of shipping, the product didn't
move their key metric - so they killed it.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW OOFOS TURNED FOAM INTO $36M BY SELLING RELIEF, NOT SHOES (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OOFOS makes squishy recovery sandals that look like garden clogs but
pull in $36M annually. It created an entire footwear category by
targeting a specific moment - when your feet are killing you after
brutal workouts. Instead of selling shoes, it sells relief using smart
psychology and ultra-specific claims like "37% more impact absorption"
rather than vague promises. 

 THE UNIMPACTFUL PM (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 CEOs are losing patience with product managers, with one describing
their last head of product as "the worst kind of nothing - an
expensive nothing." Two new trends emerged from recent interviews: a
belief that AI can reduce PM headcount and impatience with how long it
takes product leaders to create impact. 

 DESTIGMATIZING MENTAL HEALTH IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP (2 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Entrepreneurship needs to openly address mental health, especially
issues like OCD, which poses significant challenges. At the Global
Entrepreneurship Congress 2025, discussions included the importance of
destigmatizing these issues. Engaging in such conversations can lead
to better understanding and support within the industry.

(1 MINUTE READ) [16]

opportunity is monopolistic: whoever builds the best tools to track
how brands appear in AI responses could control the entire AI
marketing stack. 

 WHY MEASURE ANYTHING IF YOU'RE CRUSHING IT? (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 You're probably leaving growth on the table without knowing which
channels are most efficient, which segments have higher LTV, or where
churn is hiding.
