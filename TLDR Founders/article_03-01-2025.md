HEADLINES & TRENDS

 A FOUNDER'S MIDLIFE CRISIS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Despite hitting all the Silicon Valley checkmarks - YC, successful
exits, fundraising - the author found himself in an existential
crisis. Through group coaching and self-examination, he discovered
that his driving need for external validation had created an
unsustainable operating system. The piece explores how founders can
get trapped chasing approval rather than authenticity, and how
expanding self-awareness creates new choices in both business and
life. 

 THE NEXT BIG THING IN 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 50 of technology's top thinkers have weighed in with their
predictions for the "next big thing" in 2025. This report summarizes
the major themes and specific areas of focus that emerged from their
insights. 

 WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH FOUNDERS OVER 40 (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Founders over 40 are redefining success by prioritizing meaningful
work and family time over traditional "grind" culture. They leverage
accumulated wisdom for better decision-making and are more open to
joining larger organizations. This shift reflects a focus on
stability, predictability, and impactful contributions.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT DATA-DRIVEN LEADERS DO DIFFERENTLY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 True data-driven leadership transcends basic metrics tracking in
private equity. The most effective leaders weave data into their
decision-making DNA - not as a board presentation tool, but as their
sixth sense for staying connected to business reality. They create a
powerful feedback loop: selecting the right metrics, maintaining
simple weekly reporting rhythms, and taking decisive action on
insights. This article provides a framework for interviewing
data-driven leaders and shows what separates true practitioners from
those who just talk about metrics. 

 HOW WE BOOKED 58 MEETINGS PER MONTH WITH GOOGLE ADS (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Unify's journey to scaling Google Ads revealed that meaningful
insights only emerged after committing to five-figure monthly
spending, with the company's Growth Lead dedicating hours daily to
campaign optimization. The counterintuitive discovery that broad
keyword targeting refined by negative keywords outperformed precise
targeting shifted Unify's reach from prospects who knew what they
wanted to those who needed its solution but hadn't realized it. The
payoff came through in the numbers: after optimizing for demo bookings
rather than vanity metrics, Unify saw meetings increase 2.5x while
cutting customer acquisition costs by 70%. 

 IF A VC BACKS OUT OF A SIGNED TERM SHEET, SHOULD THE ENTREPRENEUR
SPREAD THE WORD? (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 If a deal falls through, accept some fault and avoid spreading blame
as it reflects poorly. Most people won't care about VC behavior since
the industry is known for its challenges. Focus on your startup's
growth and only share insights when advising others on VC choices.

 IN SEARCH OF AN ATTAINABLE NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION (3 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Making resolutions stick requires more than just intentions - it
demands a scientific approach to behavior change. Research shows
success comes from making value-driven goals, creating specific action
plans, and breaking big changes into mini-goals that can be rewarding.
When you fail (and you will), the key is seeing it as data rather than
defeat. This article provides a framework for turning abstract goals
into achievable changes through implementation planning and habit
stacking.
