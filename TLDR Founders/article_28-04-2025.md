HEADLINES & TRENDS

 Q1 '25 EARNINGS SEASON KICKS OFF (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Early Q1 earnings reports show software companies performing "better
than feared" despite economic headwinds. ServiceNow slightly beat
expectations and raised guidance despite lower net new ARR,
positioning itself as a "deflationary AI platform" as boards seek
cost-cutting and automation. Outside tech, a mixed picture emerges:
big banks report healthy consumer spending, but signs of caution
appear in consumer brands and housing as tariffs and high rates impact
middle and lower-income segments. SaaS valuations remain modest at a
5.0x median revenue multiple, with growth rates continuing to be the
main driver of premium valuations in an increasingly
efficiency-focused market. 

 KNOW YOUR VC (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 There are two main paths in venture capital: the selective Home Run
Hitters hunting for future $10B+ companies with smaller funds, and the
Volume Players raising massive funds to deploy capital widely while
living on management fees. Problems arise when VCs get caught in the
"messy middle"—not elite enough for top deals but trying to act like
they are. Tiger openly moves fast without much involvement, while
firms like Benchmark take concentrated positions with hands-on
support. Neither approach is wrong—the danger comes when funds
aren't honest about their strategy, pushing founders to raise too much
or setting unrealistic expectations. 

 WTF VC, Q2 2025 EDITION (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The linear “seed-A-B” assembly line is over. Startups now jump
between discrete capital pools, and valuations ride almost entirely on
conviction—whoever “believes harder” wins the round. Meanwhile,
AI is up-ending the funding game (inbound deal flow is dead and
classic SaaS looks uninvestable) and capital markets are splintering
into region- and stage-specific silos, forcing LPs and GPs to play
several fragmented games at once. Net-net: narrative beats numbers, AI
warps the field, and the one-size-fits-all VC market is gone.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE #1 THING THAT MAKES ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS SEE VALUE: A GREAT
DASHBOARD (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Building a robust dashboard is crucial for retaining and upgrading
existing SaaS customers, as it clearly communicates value to all
stakeholders, even those who never use the app. A successful dashboard
requires no additional work from users, provides daily value to key
stakeholders, and clearly displays ROI, which can accelerate deal
closures and ease renewals. By making the dashboard a core asset, apps
can differentiate themselves from competitors and justify higher
pricing. 

 WHO IS HOLDING YOU BACK? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Every organization has at least one under-performer who can
negatively impact overall productivity and performance expectations.
To address this, consider reassigning roles, offering training, or
letting them go to maintain high performance standards. Quick action
can prevent contagious underperformance and preserve team morale. 

 5 INTERESTING LEARNINGS FROM FRESHWORKS AT $800,000,000 IN ARR (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Freshworks, initially a Zendesk competitor, has grown to $800M ARR,
primarily driven by its EX products and enterprise focus. Despite a
slight downturn, it's showing modest growth with a reaccelerating
customer base and significant contributions from $50K+ clients. The
company's strategic shift to a multi-product approach and AI
integration led to increased cash flow and expanded global presence.

MISCELLANEOUS

 COORDINATION CRISIS IN MODERN TECH WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A new survey revealed that over half of tech workers waste 25-50% of
their time on "work about work" like meetings and approvals. Contrary
to expectations, in-office teams report more coordination waste than
hybrid workers. Solutions include better delegation, embracing async
work, and using AI to summarize meetings and analyze workflow
bottlenecks 

 THE STATE OF STARTUP MEDIA (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tech stories once belonged to gatekeepers like TechCrunch. Now a
revolution is brewing—a modern "Republic of Letters" where founders,
investors, and builders tell their own tales. This movement exploded
during COVID when Packy McCormick, Lenny Rachitsky, and others built
massive audiences seemingly overnight. This was because people craved
optimism and insider truths instead of journalist skepticism. The
secret isn't fancy credentials or connections—just pick one simple
idea, take it seriously, and start creating. Even with just a few
readers at first, your ideas will sharpen, your network will grow, and
you might just find your tribe along the way. 

 EUROPE'S FASTEST GROWING STARTUP? (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Swedish AI startup Lovable skyrocketed to $30M ARR in 120 days with a
team of just 18, leveraging viral growth from rebranding and
improvements on a robust initial product. Its growth strategy involved
targeted social media engagement and launching on platforms like
Product Hunt, capitalizing on word-of-mouth. Lovable's hybrid pricing
strategy combines subscriptions with usage limits, maintaining
profitability while investing in product development.
