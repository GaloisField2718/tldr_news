HEADLINES & TRENDS

 OPENAI APPROACHED CURSOR BEFORE WINDSURF (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI held talks with Anysphere, maker of the popular Cursor AI
coding tool, before entering discussions to buy rival Windsurf for $3
billion. While acquisition talks with Cursor stalled, OpenAI met with
more than 20 companies in the AI coding space before pursuing
Windsurf. 

 FIGMA FILES FOR IPO DESPITE MARKET FEARS (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Design software maker Figma has confidentially filed IPO paperwork,
bucking the trend of tech companies delaying public offerings due to
market volatility. Last valued at $12.5 billion, Figma continued to
grow after Adobe's $20 billion acquisition was blocked by regulators
in 2023. 

 AMERICAN DISRUPTION (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Globalization and scale have permanently shifted key production -
especially semiconductors - to Asia. Instead of blanket tariffs or
reviving low-end manufacturing, the U.S. should prioritize strategic
control of advanced technology and components, using its market power
to build a resilient, forward-looking supply chain.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOU'RE PROBABLY DOING USER RESEARCH WRONG (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Product teams waste resources asking the wrong questions. At a focus
group in Venice, users claimed they'd never use Tinder again—yet
moments later, nearly everyone admitted meeting someone through the
app that year. This contradiction reveals three types of research
questions with dramatically different reliability: "What did you do?"
questions about past behavior yield trustworthy insights because
people accurately remember their actions. "What are you doing?"
questions capture unfiltered reactions in real-time, revealing genuine
confusion or delight without mental editing. "What would you do?"
questions about future behavior are the least reliable, since human
imagination is flawed and influenced by virtue signaling, yet most
common. 

 YOU SHOULD PROBABLY FORM A MONETIZATION COUNCIL (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most companies have no one truly owning pricing decisions - leading
to endless meetings where nothing happens. With AI changing how
customers use products, flat-rate pricing won't work when one user
consumes 100x more than another. Create a cross-functional team
(Sales, Marketing, Product, and Finance) with actual decision-makers
who meet regularly to approve experiments and make data-driven
changes. Without this process, your pricing will grow stale as your
product evolves, leaving money on the table. 

 GPT 4.1 PROMPTING GUIDE (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This guide gives some helpful high-level tips and includes a very
clear structure for prompts. According to OpenAI developers on X, the
prompts in the guide mirror the formatting of the company's training
dataset. This means that if you structure your prompts according to
this guide, they are more likely to be in-distribution.

 7 SMART PHRASES THAT MAKE GIVING FEEDBACK EASIER (4 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Feedback conversations can be awkward minefields, but Wes Kao's
tactical phrases transform criticism into constructive dialogue that
people actually implement. Instead of bluntly saying "this looks bad,"
try "this is a great start" to acknowledge effort while signaling more
work is needed. Replace accusatory statements with "I noticed..." to
ground feedback in observable reality. When giving feedback to
powerful colleagues, the "even more" technique brilliantly frames
suggestions as enhancements rather than fixes—nothing is broken,
they're just leveling up. 

 YOUR BELIEFS ARE YOUR STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Every founder should write a manifesto. It helps you get clear about
what you're building and why it matters. A good manifesto starts with
your customers. What are they trying to do? What stands in their way?
Then explain how your approach is different. Why did you build things
this way? Most importantly, write down what you believe. These beliefs
drive your choices about features, markets, and everything else.
They're your real strategy. When you finish writing, you'll see you
weren't just making words. You were making choices that help you stand
out when talking to customers or investors.
