HEADLINES & TRENDS

 JOSH KUSHNER, THRIVE, AND THE NEW WORLD (56 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Josh Kushner's Thrive Capital has grown into a major VC firm, with
investments including a $2 billion stake in Stripe and $150 million in
OpenAI leading to substantial returns. Despite Thrive's success,
Kushner sought guidance from Rick Rubin on maintaining his intuitive
decision-making, reflecting concerns about losing this edge as
decisions often rely on non-explainable intuition. Thrive's strategic
investments, such as in OpenAI during its leadership crisis,
demonstrate its ability to capitalize on opportunities, even under
challenging circumstances. 

 GENERAL INTUITION LANDS $134M SEED TO TEACH AGENTS SPATIAL REASONING
USING VIDEO GAME CLIPS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 General Intuition raised $134M in seed funding to train AI agents
using a massive dataset from video game clips on Medal's platform,
focusing on spatial-temporal reasoning. The startup aims to apply this
technology to gaming, search-and-rescue drones, and autonomous
systems. Notably, OpenAI previously showed interest in acquiring Medal
for its valuable data, which is key to their unique training approach.


 THE NEXT PRODUCT (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Products often collapse under their own weight. Every competitor
keeps adding features until users feel exhausted, then something
simple shows up and feels new again. Innovation isn't about adding
more but about knowing when to stop and when to return to the version
that simply works and makes sense again.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MAP USER JOURNEYS TO SEARCH QUERIES AND PROMPTS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most SEO still looks like shooting arrows in the dark: picking
keywords and hoping they hit a target. Search today is closer to a
conversation than a list of results. People ask questions the way they
think, and AI tools answer them that way too. Treating search like a
guessing game misses how users actually move. Map it instead. Know
when someone's just exploring, when they're comparing, and when
they're ready to buy. 

 WHEN THE FOUNDER IS THE MOAT (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 What happens when the most valuable part of a company can walk out
the door? In the AI boom, big tech isn't buying startups, they're
hiring their founders. Data can be copied and models can be rebuilt,
but conviction can't be replaced. A founder's mindset is the real
moat. Those who play the long game build lasting companies. 

 CONGRATULATIONS, PUBLICLY (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 You can't just be happy for someone anymore. Even small moments of
support now demand an audience. A text of genuine congratulations
doesn't feel complete until it's echoed online, where friendship
doubles as performance. We call it community, but it's really
choreography. Each like, quote, and comment is part of an endless loop
of reciprocal praise. For founders, it's the same trap in different
clothes. The pressure to show momentum, post wins, and stay visible
can quietly replace the work itself.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LESSER APES (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 As AI gets smarter, people may stop thinking as hard. We are like
animals that lose their instincts when life gets too easy. Each time
we let machines handle a task, our minds become a little weaker. Use
the tools, but keep doing some work yourself, or one day you might
forget how. 

 THE AI GROWTH ENDURANCE PROBLEM (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI startups are growing faster than any SaaS wave before them, but
speed hides cracks. Today's AI boom is like a sprint run on borrowed
stamina: margins are thin, retention untested, and switching costs
low. Early growth looks great because customers are new and
competition is still forming. The real test comes when renewals hit.
Growth endurance, not growth speed, decides who survives once the hype
cools. 

 ANDREESSEN HOROWITZ HAS RETURNED AT LEAST $25 BILLION NET TO ITS
BACKERS SINCE THE FIRM'S FOUNDING IN 2009 (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Andreessen Horowitz has returned at least $25 billion to its backers
since 2009, with its $900 million 2012 Fund III hitting a 9.4x net
TVPI. The firm invests heavily in emerging tech sectors and defense,
with significant stakes in companies like Databricks. Despite its
influence, much of its fund performance remains under wraps, though
new decks reveal insights into IPO candidates and fund performance.
