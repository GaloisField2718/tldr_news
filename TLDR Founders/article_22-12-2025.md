HEADLINES & TRENDS

 MY BIGGEST FEAR IN INVESTING NOW: THE $100,000,000 ARR SLOWDOWN (7
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The $100M ARR ceiling is real, and it's catching a lot of good
companies off guard. Founders who prepare for it can still break
through. Do what works now, not what worked back in 2019. Go
multiproduct earlier, tap into AI budgets, and build genuine
platforms. 

 WHY DO COMPANIES CARE ABOUT CULTURE? (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Imagine a company where any manager can hire whoever they want with
no culture screens or founder veto. This thought experiment feels
intuitively wrong for a good reason. The average white-collar worker
is at least as much an externality to colleagues as an input into
production. When outputs can't be properly attributed, rewards for
good work are capped, and punishments for laziness are attenuated.
Culture steps in to resolve this by making profit-seeking the means to
a greater end - something worth existing beyond any individual's
tenure or payout.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DASHBOARD OR PIPES? (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Dashboard products are used directly by end users as their primary
interface for accomplishing tasks. Pipe products are used in the
background. Customers rarely interact with them directly after setup.
Companies can have both types of products in their portfolio, but
products have to choose which camp they're primarily in. The choice
will dictate product development, growth strategy, and organizational
structure. 

 HOW TO START A SALES CALL (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After watching roughly 3,000 sales calls, one thing is clear - nobody
knows how to start them. The fastest-growing startup this author
helped ($0-$6M in under 3 months) attributes its success to "knowing
exactly what to look for in discovery." 

 FINDING YOUR FIRST VALUE METRIC (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stop searching for the perfect pricing metric. You need a useful
approximation that works today and can evolve. The practical approach
- ask customers to rank which value propositions resonate most, then
rank which metrics correlate with that value. If the same pairing
shows up across multiple interviews, you're onto something. Even if
you can't charge on outcomes yet, start tracking them. Create a mock
pricing page as a hypothesis and test how prospects react before it's
live. 

 HOW TO RAISE CAPITAL WHEN YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE AN INSIDER (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Focus on solving real problems, not just raising capital, to attract
investors. Use confident body language, like leaning forward and
maintaining stillness, to convey credibility. Leverage pitch
competitions for visibility and connections, aiding in building
momentum and securing funding.

 THE PROOF NARRATIVE - HOW INVESTORS EVALUATE CALLS (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 This article breaks down what investors actually look for on
discovery calls. The heart of any investor call is proof - not slides,
but evidence. Real customer behavior. Real traction. Scientific
markers. Clinical signals. Retention patterns. Proof is anything that
shows your company is not a theory. It should be delivered calmly, not
urgently. Investors respond to clarity, not hype. When investors say
"too early," they almost never mean time. They mean your traction is
too thin, or your narrative is ahead of your evidence. The mismatch
between ambition and proof creates internal tension that kills deals. 

 CREATIVE IS THE BOTTLENECK OF MODERN USER ACQUISITION (4 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 User acquisition is no longer constrained by bids, targeting, or
channels. It's constrained by creatives. High-spend advertisers don't
win because they're more creative - they win because they produce,
test, kill, and refresh at a speed most teams can't match. Creative
fatigue isn't a vague feeling either. CTR goes down, CPI goes up, and
by the time teams align internally, the winner is already dead. Once
you scale beyond a few hundred thousand in monthly spend, creative
management stops being a creative problem and becomes an
infrastructure problem. 

 UNDERSTANDING MARKETERS' NEEDS: A HIERARCHY FOR SUCCESS (13 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 The article outlines a hierarchy of marketers' data needs, focusing
on self-awareness, competitive awareness, industry trends, sentiment,
and strategic projection. Podscan's AI onboarding uses this framework
to streamline user alert setups by identifying what data matters most
at each level. This approach aids customer understanding, improves
engagement, and enhances product relevance, especially for varied
customer segments like enterprises and solopreneurs.
