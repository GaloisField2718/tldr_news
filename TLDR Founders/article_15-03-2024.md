 THE IPO PREPARATION GUIDE (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The ‚ÄúIPO window‚Äù (best time to go public) has been mostly closed
for the past two years, but that could start to change in 2024.
Preparing for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) requires careful
planning, sometimes taking more than two years to get ready for the
public market. Here‚Äôs a breakdown that addresses accounting and
governance challenges and highlights the complex process of IPO
preparation, emphasizing early planning, and assembling the right
team. 

 THE CHANGING NATURE OF PRE-SEED (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The landscape of pre-seed investing is evolving. Many small and new
funds are decreasing their involvement or transitioning towards larger
seed rounds. This indicates a shift in investment focus from startups
that have not yet gained traction or achieved Product Market Fit to
those that have already gained some level of traction. This trend
poses a challenge for founders who are seeking pre-seed funding.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A BEGINNER‚ÄôS GUIDE TO PROGRAMMATIC SEO (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Programmatic SEO is a popular and cost-effective way to quickly grow
startups. This guide makes it easy to understand, showcasing how
companies such as Poly, Redfin, and Zapier utilized pSEO to gain
hundreds of thousands of website visitors in a short amount of time -
some in as little as 4 weeks. 

 FOR GOD‚ÄôS SAKE, FOLLOW THE LEAN STARTUP METHOD (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There has been some skepticism towards the "Lean Startup" methodology
in recent months. However, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is still
important in validating assumptions about a product's market fit.
While the tech industry has evolved significantly since the
introduction of the Lean Startup methodology, its core principles
remain valuable for entrepreneurs, albeit with some necessary
reinterpretations. 

 IS NET PROMOTER SCORE THE OZEMPIC OF METRICS? (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Net Promoter Score (NPS) is the go-to metric for customer sentiment.
However, it may not be as effective as believed due to its lack of
actionable insights and issues with timing and sampling. Customer
Effort Score (CES), rigorous and random sampling in feedback,
qualitative feedback, customer journey analytics, and Net Dollar
Retention Rate (NDR) arguably provide a more holistic and actionable
understanding of customer sentiment.

 SURF'S UP - RIDING STARTUP WAVES (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Running a startup is like surfing - the founder is like the surfer,
the product is like a surfboard, and the waves represent external
factors. The founder's skill is crucial, akin to a surfer's ability to
catch waves. While the product's quality matters, it can be refined.
The external environment, represented by the waves, poses
unpredictable challenges that are difficult to control. 

 AVOIDING PILE-UPS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 It can be tempting to put off taking action in the short term when
you have a distant deadline. However, by breaking down your work into
shorter delivery cycles - say, six weeks at a time - you're more
likely to be proactive and address issues promptly. This approach
fosters a culture of constantly prioritizing and working on the most
important tasks.
