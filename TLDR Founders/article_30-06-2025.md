HEADLINES & TRENDS

 SHOULD CHINA'S 996 WORK CULTURE BE THE NEW NORMAL FOR STARTUP
FOUNDERS? (63 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The debate over 996 work culture (9am-9pm, 6 days/week) intensifies
as VCs like Index Ventures' Martin Mignot argue it's becoming the
startup standard, while studies show 72% of founders report mental
health impacts and productivity drops after 50-hour weeks. 

 THE SHRINKING PUBLIC MARKETS, AND RISE OF PRIVATE LIQUIDITY LOOPS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Half of U.S. public companies have vanished in 30 years because
staying private got way easier. Companies can now raise billions
without IPOing and investors can still cash out through private deals.
The wild part is that companies are getting bought and sold between
private investors like trading cards, creating "fake liquidity" where
you think you're getting your money out but you're really just owning
the same company through a different fund. 

 HEALTH TECH IS HOPPING (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hinge Health's IPO delivered gains for early-stage investors while
disappointing late-stage backers, fueling cautious optimism for other
healthtech IPOs. Health tech AI investments surged, with startups like
OpenEvidence and Hippocratic AI attracting significant funding as they
develop AI tools to assist in healthcare tasks. Meanwhile, new VC fund
launches by first-time managers have sharply declined, highlighting
challenges for emerging investors.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO NAVIGATE THE AI DISTRIBUTION SHIFT (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Every major tech platform follows the same playbook: open the gates
to developers, let them build value, then squeeze them out once
dominance is achieved—and AI platforms are about to enter this
cycle. The brutal reality is you have months (not years) to pick your
platform, bet, and build something defensible before the gates close,
because as Cursor's demolition of GitHub Copilot shows, the innovation
replication cycle has compressed from 24 months to just 3-6 months. 

 HOW TO USE WIKIPEDIA TO BOOST LLM VISIBILITY (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LLMs heavily weight Wikipedia as a trusted source. Having a presence
there can significantly boost your company's visibility in
AI-generated responses, but only if you follow the strict rules.
Success requires writing neutral, factual content like a journalist
while building an ecosystem of interconnected pages for your company,
founders, and frameworks. Avoid any marketing language that
Wikipedia's 50 million editors will instantly flag. 

 THE HIDDEN COST OF BEING FIRST: A TALE OF TWO PYTHON TOOLS (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Founders often face "unavoidable complexity" when pioneering a
solution, as seen with pip in Python, which initially thrived but
became cumbersome over time. New entrants like uv learned from these
pioneers, offering streamlined alternatives by addressing known pain
points. First movers use their established position as a moat, while
successors exploit market learnings to outmaneuver incumbents.

MISCELLANEOUS

 VCS BEYOND THE MEME (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Most VCs are more interested in the investment than the person.
Building genuine relationships through hundreds of conversations
creates a network effect where you can actually connect with the right
people, making sincerity a competitive advantage in an increasingly
transactional industry. 

 THE RISE OF THE AI-NATIVE EMPLOYEE (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The hidden superpower of AI-native employees isn't just speed, it's
that failures become so cheap you can take 10x more bets with 1/10th
the mess. At Lovable ($80M ARR in 7 months with 35 people), young
employees who never learned "corporate bs" are defaulting to building
with AI instead of requesting headcount while operations roles that
only coordinate chaos and managers without vertical expertise are
heading to extinction. 

 1000X INCREASE IN AI DEMAND (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 NVIDIA's earnings reveal a shift from simple AI to more
compute-intensive reasoning, significantly increasing token usage.
Major companies like Microsoft and Google are experiencing massive
demand spikes and deploying thousands of GPUs weekly. To meet AI
demand, hyperscalers have planned over $300 billion in capex for new
data centers termed "AI factories."
