HEADLINES & TRENDS

 DEEL SPY TELLS ALL! (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The corporate espionage case between Deel and Rippling just escalated
with Deel's spy confessing that the CEO personally recruited him,
promised he'd be "like James Bond," and paid him $6K monthly through
cryptocurrency to avoid leaving traces. 

 WHAT DO TARIFFS MEAN FOR STARTUPLAND? (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The new tariffs are hitting markets broadly, but their impact on
startups varies by business model. Most software companies won't see
changes to their cost structure unless they rely on imported hardware
components. The bigger concern is revenue growth, as tech companies
generate nearly half their revenue internationally - meaning tariffs
could create sales uncertainty in a significant portion of their
business. This uncertainty typically leads to slower sales cycles and
delayed investments, but there's reason for optimism: IT spend is
projected to grow from 2.5% to 4% of GDP by 2030, with AI adoption
potentially accelerating as companies focus on controlling costs
during uncertain times. 

 A GLOBAL ECONOMIST'S TAKE ON TARIFFS: 'AMERICAN CONSUMERS WILL GET
HURT' (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The planned 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will disrupt nearly
every sector due to integrated trade partnerships. Even the 10% China
tariff increases consumer prices. These create both immediate problems
(higher input costs and reduced consumer spending) and second order
effects (dollar appreciation hurting exporters) without corresponding
policies to boost domestic manufacturing. Prepare for conditions where
consumers either pay more, seek alternatives, or reduce spending
entirely - with few protective measures available.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THIS IS WHY YOU'RE NOT SHIPPING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Your team isn't shipping fast because of structural problems hiding
in plain sight: waiting for scheduled 1:1s to solve immediate
problems, requiring cross-team approvals that create bottlenecks,
rigid team structures that can't adapt to changing priorities,
sales-led cultures where engineers are outnumbered, "keeping people in
the loop" busy work, tolerating average performers who never raise the
bar, and an addiction to predictability that avoids necessary risks. 

 YOUR PRODUCT TEAM DOESN'T NEED A "NORTH STAR METRIC" (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Product teams waste hours debating the perfect North Star Metric only
to land on something meaningless. Apple, Netflix, and Facebook made
their biggest breakthroughs by following a strategic narrative instead
of a single number. This "North Star Strategy" works better for
complex products with different user types or multiple usage modes. It
allows teams to make decisions based on vision rather than short-term
metric optimization that might sacrifice long-term growth. 

 MATURITY FRAMEWORKS: A HIDDEN GEM IN YOUR GTM STRATEGY (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Want to break out of feature-based selling and start selling business
outcomes? Implement a maturity framework that maps your customers'
journey from beginner to best-in-class, complete with assessment tools
that help prospects benchmark themselves against peers. Companies like
BEA Systems, MeridianLink, and Marketo have transformed their sales
cycles by shifting conversations from "Do you want this feature?" to
"Here's where you stand compared to competitors, and here's how we
help you advance."

MISCELLANEOUS

 QUICK HINGE HEALTH S-1 THOUGHTS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 For those following digital health's first major IPO attempt of 2025,
Hinge Health's S-1 reveals what really drives success in healthcare:
the company has eliminated co-pays through employer flexibility,
achieving rapid patient adoption while showing ROI, and built powerful
distribution through channel partners that both accelerate sales and
create dangerous dependency. As AI increasingly commoditized the
virtual PT experience itself, its physical Enso pain device pointed to
an unexpected truth - in a world obsessed with software, sometimes
hardware creates the strongest defensibility in healthcare. 

 HOW TO BUILD A TIER 1 FUND (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Kirsten Green's Forerunner has grown into a major venture firm. It
has raised nearly $3 billion since 2012 by focusing on strategic
team-building and decision-making. Green emphasizes partnership,
seeking traits like complementary strengths and strategic foresight in
investors, even with long feedback cycles. Forerunner has established
itself as a premier player, especially in consumer investments, by
creating an in-house research team and focusing on consistent yearly
strategic expansion. 

 THE PIVOT TO PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (23 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Many successful startups like Slack and Twitter achieved growth
through strategic pivots by refining their target market or product
offerings. Vanta shifted its focus from broad solutions to solving
specific customer needs, while Lattice moved from OKR software to
performance management based on customer feedback. Other companies
like Shippo and Ironclad discovered new directions by addressing
overlooked market needs or honing in on their unique value
propositions.
