 EVERY NEW AI FEATURE YOU SHIP MAKES YOUR BILLING PROBLEM WORSE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Here's a quick litmus test: can you launch a new AI feature tomorrow
- with pricing that varies by tokens, model, region, and complexity -
without creating new SKUs, without touching CPQ, and without manually
adjusting invoices?

If not, every feature you add is compounding your operational overhead
instead of your revenue.

A new whitepaper from Metronome [5] argues that billing for AI
products needs to work like a runtime system - computing pricing
continuously as usage happens, not generating invoices after the fact.
It covers why legacy billing architectures break under dimensional
pricing, how credit-based monetization works [5], and how to assess
whether your current stack can keep up.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 DISAASTER STRIKES CYBERSECURITY (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic announced Claude Code Security on Thursday. By Friday
close, the Cyber ETF dropped 5% and Qualys fell 12%. The panic is
teaching us more than the product itself. Okta and SailPoint cratered
10-11% despite Anthropic not mentioning "identity" once. Check Point
and Fortinet barely flinched. The market is pricing in fear, not
facts. If you're building in security, here's the cheat sheet:
app-layer testing is about to get steamrolled by the foundation model
labs, but categories with real infrastructure moats remain wide open
for the next $10B+ cyber company. 

 AI BUILDING: FIRST PRINCIPLES STILL WORK. SAAS INSTINCTS DON'T (12
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The first principles of building a great company hadn't changed.
Solve a real problem, deliver value that compounds, build something
that's hard to replicate, and earn customers' trust. What's changed is
the operating environment in which those principles must be applied.
Founders who build enduring AI companies are the ones who have the
discipline to hold on to first principles. These founders are
expanding the size of their categories themselves rather than just
building companies.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 STRATEGIC CHOICES: WHEN BOTH OPTIONS ARE GOOD (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Here's a good test for whether you've actually made a strategic
decision: if the opposite of your position sounds dumb, it's not a
real choice. "We put customers first" doesn't count. This piece runs
through 12 choice pairs that actually matter - bootstrapped vs.
funded, platform vs. point solution, sales-led vs. product-led - and
shows what you're giving up on each side. Most founders never
explicitly pick. They just end up somewhere and tell themselves a
story about why. 

 TRAVIS KALANICK'S FUNDRAISING ADVICE FOR STARTUPS (1 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Travis Kalanick advises startups to delay fundraising until achieving
maximum traction for better terms and a competitive process. For those
with existing VC backing, he suggests strategic timing to leverage
incoming VC interest before formally raising funds. 

 PRAYING FOR DISTRIBUTION (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Tech companies are increasingly prioritizing distribution over
product, with costs appearing in unexpected areas like COGS, as seen
with AI companies treating inference costs as marketing. R&D is being
leveraged to create self-sufficient products, evident in Atlassian's
PLG model, spending more on R&D than S&M. Rising acquisition costs,
indicated by longer CAC payback periods and decreasing NRR, emphasize
the need for CFOs to focus on efficient distribution strategies.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 SULLY.AI, BASETEN, AND NVIDIA PARTNER TO SHIP 10X FASTER, CHEAPER &
SPECIFIC MODELS FOR HEALTHCARE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 After moving to open source models such as gpt-oss-120b, Sully.ai's
[12] inference costs dropped by 90%, while response times improved by
65%, setting a new speed benchmark for healthcare AI. Sully.ai [12]
has now returned over 30 million minutes to physicians. 

 HYPERAGENT (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Hyperagent is an agents platform where every session has an isolated,
full computing environment in the cloud. It provides real browsers,
code execution, image/video generation, data warehouse access,
hundreds of integrations, and the ability to learn any new API as a
skill. The agents follow conversations, understand context, and act
when relevant. Hyperagent can be deployed into Slack with one click. 

 DO ANYTHING (TOOL) [14] 

 Personal AI agent for everyday tasks 

 WEBHOUND (TOOL) [15] 

 Long-running autonomous research agent.

 MERCENARY VS. MISSIONARY STARTUPS: CHOOSE YOUR NEXT ADVENTURE (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This thread contrasts two founder archetypes: mercenaries, who
optimize for valuation and exit, and missionaries, who optimize for
solving a problem they deeply identify with. Prioritizing trust and
mission over short-term economics ultimately saved the company.
Missionary founders reveal themselves in how they pitch (problem-first
vs. money-first), how they act under existential pressure
(rule-breaking decisiveness like Steve Jobs at Apple), and how they
compound advantages over time through customer obsession and
reinvestment (as seen with Jeff Bezos). 

 THE FILE SYSTEM IS THE NEW DATABASE (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 No database. No API. Just 80+ markdown and YAML files running a full
personal operating system for AI agents - and it works better than the
fancy alternatives. Agents pull only what they need. A voice encoding
system keeps your tone consistent. Memory logs build context over
time. The takeaway for anyone building AI-native products is
surprisingly simple - your file system might be the best data layer
you already have.
