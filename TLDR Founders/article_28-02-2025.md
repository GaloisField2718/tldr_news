HEADLINES & TRENDS

 FEEDING THE LP BEAST (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 An inside look at pitching to limited partners (LPs) who aren't
venture experts. Many emerging managers rush into their fund “why”
too late. First explain the “why venture,” “why emerging
managers,” and “why your vertical or industry” before ever
talking about your specific fund. Reduce confusion and avoid making
anyone feel foolish in high-end, complex fundraising settings. 

 AI IS SOLVING SAAS PRODUCT ADOPTION (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Vertical AI is knocking down old barriers that have kept certain
industries from fully embracing SaaS. With LLMs handling unstructured
data, specialized wedge products can slip into legacy systems more
smoothly. Traditional adoption hurdles—like tricky integrations and
user retraining—fade because AI can meet teams in their existing
workflows. In essence, even industries notorious for clinging to old
tech are warming up once they see how vertical AI automates tedious
tasks and slashes costs. 

 STATE OF THE PRIVATE MARKETS FEBRUARY 2025 (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A snapshot of who's up, who's down, and which pre-IPO darlings are
winning across HR tech, security, and legal software. Also flags the
fastest-growing headcounts (like AI devs) and the biggest recent
layoffs. Deel's near $1B revenue run rate, Wiz's sprint toward $1B
ARR, and Harvey's rocket-ship growth in legal AI top the watchlist.
For founders, it's a heads-up on fundraising trends, M&A chatter, and
executive hires that might hint at looming IPOs.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CREDITS PRICING SUCKS AND USERS HATE IT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Credits-based pricing often mixes the worst of subscriptions and
pay-as-you-go: customers pre-pay for usage they might never need,
while the real cost remains fuzzy. A story about sinking $60k into
unused credits drives the point home. The alternative? Progressive
billing that charges incrementally as actual usage grows. It's
simpler, trust-building, and prevents nasty surprises—especially
critical in AI, DevTools, and infrastructure services. 

 50 THINGS WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT BUILDING SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 A quick-hitting list of lessons from the PostHog team on building and
shipping software at speed. Emphasis on small, autonomous teams,
shipping daily (even if it's imperfect), and letting engineers talk
directly to users. A “no design by default” approach can
accelerate releases, while strong ownership cuts needless planning.
The overarching theme: transparency, ruthless trimming of overhead,
and immediate feedback loops let good products take shape before your
eyes. 

 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO SAAS PRICING STRATEGY (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Tomasz Tunguz outlines how software pricing can be a defensive burden
or an offensive edge. He breaks down three strategies—maximization,
penetration, and skimming—and explores how usage-based pricing is
gaining traction (e.g., Twilio, AWS). Veblen goods, weird edge cases
like performance pricing, and the rise of AI-based add-ons show how
pricing is more than math. It's a powerful way to reinforce brand
positioning and ensure your SaaS can scale revenue predictably.

 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN KNOWLEDGE IS COMMODITIZED? (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A reflection on how tools like AI coding assistants erase the moat of
“knowing how to code.” Once knowledge is freely accessible,
curiosity and creativity become the real differentiators. Drawing on
personal anecdotes—like using AI to build a functional flight
simulator in days—the piece suggests that building interesting
projects no longer hinges on deep expertise. Instead, it's about
figuring out which ideas to pursue and having the drive to see them
through. 

 10 PRODUCTIVITY TIPS FOR NEW ENTREPRENEURS (19 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Entrepreneurs often juggle multiple tasks, making time management
crucial. Combining Time Blocking with the Pomodoro Technique can
enhance focus and reduce burnout. Strategies like creating a To-Don't
List, embracing the Pareto Principle, and leveraging delegation and
automation can optimize productivity. Maintaining a growth mindset,
infusing work with fun, and ensuring self-care are key to sustainable
entrepreneurial success. 

 THE CAPACITY ALLOCATION ILLUSION (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The common practice of tracking engineering time spent on different
initiatives fundamentally misunderstands how capacity works in
software development. While executives ask "where did our money go?"
based on hours worked, real capacity is built through long-term
investments in everything from team psychological safety to codebase
knowledge. The piece uses manufacturing analogies to show how focusing
purely on time allocation ignores the complex systems that determine a
team's true capability to deliver value.
