HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE OPENAI KEYNOTE (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sam Altman took to the stage to announce new products and features
available from OpenAI at the company‚Äôs first-ever developer
conference. Here‚Äôs a long take that breaks down the talk and the key
takeaways. 

 MORE GOOD NEWS IN STARTUPLAND (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DataDog announced earnings that beat plans. In its earnings call, it
mentions that it‚Äôs seeing signs that the cost-cutting activities
that dominated the start of this year are plateauing, which hopefully
acts as a signal of good news for tech. 

 HOW AN INVESTOR MIGHT CATEGORIZE YOUR AI STARTUP (8 MINUTE READ) [10]


 A GP at Angular Ventures tries to make sense of all the emerging AI
startups by categorizing the application ideas we are seeing into
three broad groups. They only look at startups in the application
layer, rather than the model layer.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CAN MOST ‚ÄúPRETTY GOOD‚Äù SALES REPS SELL ANY SAAS PRODUCT? (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Probably not. When hiring salespeople, dig into these points. Known
brands are easier to sell, and enterprise SaaS is meaningfully
different from SaaS built for smaller businesses. Only the very best
salespeople can context switch between SaaS effectively. 

 YOUR BUSINESS MODEL DRIVES YOUR MEASUREMENT (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Usage-based pricing seems to be rising in popularity. It‚Äôs a
revenue model that scales value for both parties as a customer uses
your product more. What metric you decide to pivot your pricing around
is hard to land on. This metric is commonly called the ‚ÄúValue
Metric‚Äù. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of metrics used by some top companies.


 THE BRAINTRUST: WHAT SHOULD YOU HAVE INVESTED IN SOONER? (7 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Reflections from a diverse set of 8 unicorn founders on things they
might have done differently earlier on in building their businesses.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SOFTWARE MARKET GENES (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Software building on top of open-source LLMs, how defensible is that?
A lot of AI, much like vertical SaaS, is a winner-take-most market.
Investors and founders are racing to reach an inflection point that
brings down their CAC and makes market capture increasingly easier. 

 TAKE TIME TO PROCESS A FAILURE BEFORE STARTING A NEW COMPANY (3
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Shutting down a company often comes with a grieving process, just
like a breakup or the loss of a loved one. Give yourself time to
process before jumping back into the startup fray ‚Äì investors tend
to watch out for clear rebounds. 

 TRANSPARENCY IS HARD TO DO WELL (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Teams with high trust often function more efficiently. Trust requires
a degree of transparency, but transparency can be unsettling without
context. How you share information is just as important as what you
share.

QUICK LINKS

 A JOB IS JUST A PHASE IN SOMEONE‚ÄôS LIFE (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Managers and employees often play this bizarre game where they
pretend the employee will be working at the company forever. That‚Äôs
never the case and the company won‚Äôt be around forever either.
Honest conversations about career ambitions will help with retention
and trust building. 

 11 HOURS SINCE OPENAI DEV DAY: HERE IS WHAT PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY BUILT
(5 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 If you haven‚Äôt seen the news about OpenAI Dev Day yet, this thread
gives a good estimation of what is now possible. It‚Äôs pretty
mind-blowing. 

 EVEN THE SMARTEST VCS SOMETIMES GET IT WRONG - BILL GURLEY AND
REGULATED MARKETS (6 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Bill Gurley gave an impassioned talk at the All-In Summit a few weeks
ago that has been held in high regard. Here to give the counterpoint,
Steve Blank lays out why he thinks Gurley might have gotten it wrong.
Gurley‚Äôs talk and Blank‚Äôs rebuttal are both well said.
