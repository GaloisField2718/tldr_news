HEADLINES & TRENDS

 FOUNDER-LED GROWTH PLAYBOOK (29 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Startup failures often stem from founders' inadequate approach to
growth, with Matt Lerner in this post stressing the importance of
founder-led growth. Lerner's framework identifies frequent growth
traps and emphasizes mapping the customer journey, understanding
motivations, and conducting rapid experiments to uncover impactful
growth levers. Founders should initially spearhead growth efforts to
gain critical business insights, aligning their teams with a growth
mindset before hiring dedicated growth specialists. 

 TARIFF CHAOS & CHINA DECOUPLING POSE TWIN THREATS FOR STARTUPS & VCS
(7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Trump's erratic tariff policies are disrupting markets, stalling
IPOs, and complicating tech supply chains. Despite the market chaos,
some Trump-supporting VCs reluctantly criticize the tariffs while
still expressing support for Trump. The tech industry remains uneasy
about potential long-term economic impacts and weakened innovation
prospects. 

 A LETTER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM FEMALE FOUNDERS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Proposed tariffs on consumer goods disproportionately threaten small
businesses, increasing costs and potentially leading to higher prices
for consumers. Small businesses, especially those in the CPG sector,
lack the capacity to absorb these costs or reconfigure supply chains
quickly. Entrepreneurs urge policymakers to collaborate on fair trade
solutions, including tariff exemptions and support for domestic supply
chain transitions.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHEN CHURN IS THE MODEL (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Some businesses aren't meant to keep customers forever - they're
deliberately designed for users to leave. Education platforms expect
you to finish learning Spanish and move on. For these "recurring
market" businesses, the metrics flip: instead of lifetime value and
retention, what matters is solving one critical problem perfectly,
showing up exactly when needed (usually via search), and compressing
all your value into a single transaction. This changes everything
about how you build - speed trumps depth, trust outweighs features,
and your CAC payback must happen immediately, not over years. 

 GUIDE TO SURVIVE A RECESSION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Companies don't die from slow growth - they die from running out of
cash. With recession odds jumping from 18% to 55% since January due to
tariff uncertainty, CFOs need a plan now. The ripple effects are
predictable as stock markets tank, IPOs freeze, VCs slow fundraising,
companies cut spending, which further reduces revenue across the
board. To survive this perfect storm (especially with AI accelerating
job displacement), companies should watch leading sales metrics before
adding headcount and have a "Plan B" for getting to cash flow positive
before money runs out. 

 YOU'RE NOT READY FOR A HEAD OF GROWTH (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Don't rush to hire a Head of Growth—own it first. Early-stage
growth can't be delegated. Founders should dive hands-on into
discovering "growth levers": pinpoint bottlenecks in your customer
journey, deeply understand user motivations (use "Jobs to Be Done"
interviews), and rapidly experiment to move those levers. Avoid
getting stuck in the traps of overthinking, underthinking, or
prematurely delegating, and instead embed an experimental,
growth-driven mindset across your team. Remember, PayPal's explosive
growth hinged on a few high-impact bets—yours will too.

 BASE POWER COMPANY: CHAPTER 2 (91 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Base Power Company has gone from theory to installing over 1,000 home
batteries across Texas in just one year, raising $200M, and expanding
into homebuilder and utility partnerships along the way. What makes
its story fascinating isn't just the speed of execution, but its
strategic positioning as the "operating system" for electricity that
controls the critical layer between generation and consumption. The
best vertical integrators don't try to do everything themselves on day
one, they start with a focused beachhead, prove it works, then expand
methodically. 

 SOLO FOUNDER SYNDROME (EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT ALONE) (3 MINUTE READ) [15]


 The most dangerous trap founders fall into isn't being alone - it's
acting alone. Solo Founder Syndrome happens when a CEO tries to carry
the entire company on their back, serving as the bottleneck for every
decision. The most capable founders are most vulnerable precisely
because they can pull it off... until they can't. Watch for the
warning signs: an impossibly packed calendar, board meetings as
one-person shows, the CEO being inserted into every process, and
delegation without decision-making authority. 

 5 INTERESTING LEARNINGS FROM RUBRIK AT $1.1 BILLION IN ARR (2 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 SaaS Security firm Rubrik's IPO has impressed with a $13B market cap,
an 80% rise, and $1.1B ARR at 39% growth. Its success is driven by
significant cybersecurity demand, from both financial and operational
aspects, posting a 120% NRR and barely positive cash flow. Notably,
Rubrik grew from 23 to 2,246 $100K+ customers since 2019, highlighting
its strong market traction.
