HEADLINES & TRENDS

 MISALIGNED INCENTIVES IN VENTURE CAPITAL (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The growing disconnect between general partners and founders is
reshaping venture capital dynamics. With fund sizes expanding, many
firms now prioritize management fees over profit-sharing incentives,
leading to rapid capital deployment and less involvement with
portfolio companies. Founders should assess if their VCs prioritize
“2% or 20%” motives, focusing on whether the partnership aligns
with growth or fund management. 

 DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FUNDS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Two new fund announcements reveal contrasting strategies in venture
capital. General Catalyst's $8B raise embodies the “capital
agglomerator” approach, leveraging vast resources across sectors,
while Chemistry Fund's $350M strategy embraces boutique investing,
emphasizing close founder partnerships. This juxtaposition highlights
the importance for founders to align with a fund's philosophy —
whether they need broad support from larger firms or focused
commitment from a specialized partner. 

 A $1.7B FAILURE | PE BUYS ZUORA (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Zuora's $1.7B acquisition by Silver Lake offers mixed results for
investors, as IPO investors lost nearly 30% over six years due to
dilution. Despite low valuations, Zuora has characteristics PE firms
find attractive, including a manageable revenue multiple and signs of
improved free cash flow. Silver Lake's success depends on reducing
complexity in Zuora's implementation-heavy product and drastically
cutting stock-based compensation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO HELP YOUR NEW AES MASTER THE DISCOVERY CALL (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Ramping up new Account Executives (AEs) can be challenging,
especially during the discovery call phase. Setting a clear agenda,
engaging each participant, and sending fast follow-ups are key steps
to building a productive dialogue. Documenting and coaching based on
these principles helps AEs understand buyer personas and maintain a
structured cadence. Role-playing and real-time feedback also enable
new AEs to master essential sales skills. 

 BUILDING AN SEO GROWTH MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A top-down SEO growth model helps secure internal support by
projecting future traffic, conversions, and revenue generated through
SEO efforts. Start by estimating incremental traffic from direct
competitors (high-intent) and indirect competitors (lower-intent),
applying relevance discounts to ensure accuracy. Convert projected
traffic into conversions, using historical rates for high- and
low-intent traffic, and finally, calculate revenue by applying
customer lifetime value (LTV). This model provides a clear,
data-driven roadmap, highlighting the tangible impact of SEO
investment for key stakeholders. 

 YOUR GUIDE TO FUNDRAISING (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Raising capital isn't about the sprint. It's a year-long strategy of
building relationships, nurturing trust, and creating momentum well
before you're in urgent need. This 12-month roadmap lays out each
phase, from early connections and consistent updates to perfecting
your pitch and securing those essential investor intros. Following
this plan helps founders avoid last-minute scrambles and secure
capital with confidence, positioning them strongly in the fundraising
process.

 DON'T BE EVIL (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This reflection examines why companies, like Google, struggle to
maintain their ideals as they grow. Initially, Google's “Don't be
evil” mantra seemed achievable due to its financial success, which
allowed it to avoid certain compromises. However, many companies,
driven by survival rather than profit, are forced to adopt practices
that challenge their principles. As ambitions rise — especially in
sectors like AI — the tension between ideals and market pressures
intensifies. Lofty goals are admirable, but most companies must
navigate compromises to thrive in competitive markets. 

 THE OBSESSION OVER CRAFT (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Craft is now a focal point in software design, encompassing high
standards for quality, technique, and meticulous attention to detail.
This standard in design impacts three critical areas: culture,
artifacts, and trust. A culture of craft elevates standards and
influences team behavior. 

 GLOBAL M&A REPORT - Q3 2024 (REPORT) [18] 

 The M&A market is accelerating, with a strong recovery noted across
the first three quarters of 2024. Global deal value surged by 27.6%,
while deal count saw a 13.3% uptick compared to last year. Private
equity is also back in action, capturing a 41.2% share of M&A deal
value YTD, reflecting a resurgence driven by increased lending from
major banks.
