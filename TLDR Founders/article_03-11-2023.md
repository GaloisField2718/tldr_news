 Google has made over 250 acquisitions. Facebook, Amazon, and Apple

reasonably successful companies, and hyper-successful ones. But M&A is
really hard. This article unpacks some of the elements of great
acquisitions in this long read. Most of the case studies are
late-stage companies, but the principles remain true if you‚Äôre an
earlier-stage company looking to acquire.

 This post explores the concept of "The Generational Business Trap."

longevity is continuously reinventing oneself, maintaining
customer-centricity, and fostering an innovative culture. The post
also provides examples and offers practical tips for avoiding this
trap.
