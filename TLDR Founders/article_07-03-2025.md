HEADLINES & TRENDS

 SOFTWARE MOATS ARE GONE! (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AI-assisted coding is making it trivial for anyone to build software
quickly, eroding a once-defining moat. Complex code isn't a huge
differentiator anymore—so real advantages must come from things like
trust, unique data, or rock-solid distribution. This piece breaks down
how to steer your product strategy when writing code is no longer a
major barrier. 

 WILL AI HAVE A TASTE ALL OF ITS OWN? (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 There's a growing sense that AI might eventually develop creative
preferences that differ from human sensibilities. Early signs show it
praises its own AI-written poetry or text in ways humans might find
off-base. While AI isn't matching human literary brilliance just yet,
this “AI taste” could lead to new forms of expression and markets
we haven't imagined. Engaging with these shifts now might reveal novel
opportunities in art and writing. 

 HOW DATA-DRIVEN CAN VC INVESTING BE? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Inspired by the rigor of public-market quants, some VCs are starting
to apply advanced analytics to spot promising startups. With more data
on private companies, they can scale their coverage beyond the typical
few hundred deals and do deeper checks than the traditional “pattern
matching” approach. For entrepreneurs, it means you may face more
precise questions around growth signals and market data—and new ways
of standing out if your metrics are strong.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EXAMPLES OF PROVEN SALES PLAYS TO CREATE A SALES PIPELINE ON TOP OF
SELF-SERVE USAGE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 If your product-led motion is attracting hordes of free users, how do
you convert the most promising ones into paying customers? This guide
shares multi-touch sales “plays” from Miro, Unity, and Clay, all
of which rely on usage data and well-timed, personalized outreach.
It's not about sending generic mass emails, but about noticing
signals—like hitting a feature limit or inviting new teammates—and
positioning your upgraded plans at precisely the right moment. 

 HOW TO LAUNCH YOUR STARTUP WITHOUT A LAUNCH (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Startups should focus on optimizing conversion, engaging communities,
and building a following well before officially launching. Collecting
contact information ensures direct reach unaffected by algorithm
changes. Establishing relationships with journalists and utilizing
scalable event models can also amplify launch success. 

 DO GROSS MARGINS MATTER? (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Yes, and here's why: gross margin sets the upper limit for how
profitable your startup can eventually become. Early on, you might
focus more on growth than on unit economics, but if it's always
expensive to deliver your product, profitability remains out of reach.
For AI-heavy solutions, shifting compute costs can make margins
unpredictable. Savvy founders calculate how each new technology change
impacts the direct cost of offering their service.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOD TASTE MAKES GREAT PRODUCTS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Developers often obsess over deadlines and functionality but forget
how crucial an intuitive, visually coherent design can be. Here's a
short primer on building “taste”: follow time-tested UI patterns
(like consistent button styles), avoid messy grid layouts, and keep
prototypes cheap and quick so you can spot awkward flows early. The
reward is a product that feels natural and satisfying, even if users
can't put their finger on why. 

 COMPANY BLOGS ARE NO LONGER WORTH THE INVESTMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [14]


 Big brands with once-thriving blogs are seeing traffic
collapse—partly thanks to changes in how people search and consume
content. Readers increasingly prefer short-form video,
personality-driven newsletters, and interactive communities. Instead
of pouring time into blog posts that go unread, a shift toward
influencer partnerships, valuable behind-the-scenes stories, or niche
newsletters may deliver better engagement. 

 DEFENDING AMERICAN AI LEADERSHIP: DEEPSEEK IS A DISTRACTION, NOT A
DISRUPTOR (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 DeepSeek impressed by training a powerful AI model for $6M using
creative engineering, sparking calls for tighter export controls. Its
success highlights the ongoing importance of reinforcement learning in
post-training, though it is still behind top US models in real-world
performance. US labs, with superior resources, continue to lead the
push towards AGI, emphasizing the need for robust AI infrastructure
and security.
