 THE STORY OF A CAP TABLE: KLARNA (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sequoia Capital emerged as the big winner in Klarna's IPO, securing a
7x return on its investment. Klarna's journey from a loan provider to
a neobank involved major shifts in its cap table, including founder
exits, a boardroom battle, and an 85% down-round. Sequoia's strategic
moves, including early investment and avoiding 2021's inflated
fundraising rounds, were key to its success.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY THE FUTURE OF SAAS IS EAT OR BE EATEN (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI disruption is forcing SaaS companies to innovate or risk
obsolescence. Traditional giants like Microsoft may pivot to
acquisitions, while smaller SaaS startups face pressure to quickly
secure large enterprise deals or risk being acquired. As AI redefines
industry workflows, companies in sectors like healthcare and finance
must harness data in transformative ways to stay competitive. 

 MY #1 TIP WHEN YOU ARE PITCHING VCS: JUST ASK THEM WHAT THE ODDS ARE
THEY'D INVEST (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ask VCs about the odds of their investment decision at the end of
your pitch meeting to save time and avoid confusion. This direct
approach helps prevent feeling "ghosted" by providing clarity on their
interest level. Experienced VCs usually know their investment
likelihood by the end of the first meeting, so just ask to gain
immediate insight.

practices are crucial. Be transparent about data usage and consider
partnerships for compliance infrastructure.

 A PRIMER ON THE CREATOR CAPITAL MARKETS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Creator financing went from fringe experiment to full capital market
in three years, with multiple paths beyond bootstrapping.
Revenue-based financing from companies like Spotter lets creators get
cash today for a percentage of future YouTube earnings - great when
income is steady, but risky when algorithms change. Some investors buy
into specific creator businesses like MrBeast's Feastables, while
others invest in everything a creator does by backing their parent
company. A creator who needs $50K for new equipment might take revenue
financing and pay it back from their next six months of ad revenue,
while someone launching multiple businesses might sell 20% of their
company to an investor who can help them grow faster.
