HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE DISEQUILIBRIUM ADVANTAGE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Startups face two clocks: burn rate and relevance as rapid change
shortens runway impact. AI acts as a multiplier, shifting bottlenecks
from execution to integration, distribution, and decision-making.
Success hinges on building systems that address new constraints,
prioritize trust, and focus on measurable outcomes rather than mere
output. 

 DON'T CONFUSE MARKET SHARE WITH WINNING (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Market share is a point estimate, not a scoreboard. When the iPhone
launched in 2007, Apple's share was negligible next to Nokia and
BlackBerry. Today, Apple holds less than 25% of the global smartphone
share. No one questions who's winning. DoorDash entered food delivery
late, after Grubhub, Seamless, and Caviar. When Uber Eats tried to buy
market share with heavy subsidies, DoorDash focused on building a
logistics engine for suburban markets that competitors ignored. The
pattern across Sequoia's portfolio is consistent: outliers don't chase
market share. They build something that the market eventually moves
toward.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR PROBLEM FRAMING IS SABOTAGING YOUR STRATEGY (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Poor problem framing undermines strategic efforts in tech as
companies focus on outputs over customer needs. The "build to learn"
approach emphasizes technologies rather than understanding user
problems, leading to misguided product metrics. Successful problem
design requires collaboration, clear customer-driven objectives, and a
focus on solutions that users value. 

 PITCH YOUR FELLOW FOUNDER (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Founder-led podcasts, newsletters, and livestreams are the most
underutilized channels for early-stage startups. These platforms care
less about scale and more about perspective. One accounting software
startup runs a weekly livestream where founders announce products,
share funding news, and talk through what's actually working. The bar
for getting on is different than traditional press. You need a news
hook, a distinct point of view, or expertise other founders can apply.
One AI startup got on with a launch, a three-month demo waitlist, and
a yacht party. The pitch was a casual DM. 

 ON PRICING, PILOTS, AND EARLY-STAGE ENTERPRISE STARTUPS (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Early-stage enterprise AI founders should focus on the type of
company they want to build rather than obsessing over specific pricing
models. The key tradeoff is between high-volume growth versus
high-price, low-volume niches, which shapes GTM strategy, sales
motions, and churn risk. Design pilots deliberately with internal
champions, scoped outcomes, and clear exit criteria, while pricing
based on controllable factors like usage or memory to reduce
surprises. Multiple tiers, add-ons, and explicit SLAs give startups
leverage with enterprise buyers. Founders should be deliberate and
flexible with pricing, as it directly impacts revenue trajectory,
fundraising, and scaling speed.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AGENCY IS THE LAST FRONTIER (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Despite unprecedented access to knowledge, tools, and capital, most
people fail to act and achieve meaningful outcomes. The limiting
factor today is agency, the willingness to start, iterate, and learn
by doing. High-agency people close the gap between what's possible and
what actually happens. Capital, AI tools, and information are
abundant, but action remains rare and is the key differentiator. Stop
waiting and begin building now. 

 VERTICAL SOFTWARE ALREADY WON THE CONTEXT GRAPH (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Vertical software companies have been building context graphs,
crucial for autonomous agents, by capturing specific business
decisions for over a decade. Unlike horizontal platforms with broad,
flexible data models, vertical software uses industry-specific
ontologies to record reasoning and integrate functions, making
decision traces more reconstructible. As AI and embedded services
grow, vertical platforms hold a strategic advantage over horizontal
SaaS and agent-first startups, with their deeply established context
graphs.
