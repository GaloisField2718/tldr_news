 THE MONETIZATION MODEL POWERING LOVABLE'S BREAKOUT GROWTH (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 As Lovable's growth rocketed, they needed a new way to price AI.
While traditional SaaS pricing models are breaking down, it's not yet
clear what will take their place.

In this live webinar [4], Elena Verna, Lovable's Head of Growth, will
share pricing strategies her team uses to better reflect the value AI
delivers. Join to learn [4]:

1️⃣ Why AI has upended the logic of SaaS pricing and why there's
still no clear playbook

2️⃣ How Lovable navigates the tension between self-serve and
enterprise monetizations

3️⃣ What it takes to evolve from usage-based pricing to
outcomes-based value

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 BET THE FARM (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Many companies are bragging about wide-scale AI adoption, but their
hallway conversations tell a different story: many employees haven't
opened AI tools in weeks. Dashboards are showing logins, not usage.
This is transformation theater. Companies that go all in on AI by
making it mandatory tell a different story: increased revenue and
lower headcount. The best people see the theater and leave for places
where transformation is real. 

 THE AGE OF SCALING IS OVER! (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI labs have spent five years betting that more data and more GPUs
would solve everything. That bet is no longer paying off. As scaling
laws flatten, the industry is shifting focus to "test-time compute",
forcing models to spend more resources reasoning during a task rather
than just training bigger brains.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 9 REASONS ICPS DON'T BOOK A DEMO (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most companies run ads before they actually know who they're selling
to. The "GTM Delta" framework forces you to fix your foundation,
“Market and Message,” before spending a dime on sales plays. If
you don't know exactly who your buyer is, automation just scales your
failure. Stop dumping "content libraries" on prospects. Your job isn't
to be a library - it's to be a guide. 

 THE INVESTOR CALL FRAMEWORK (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The moment you lose control of the meeting structure is the moment
you lose the investment. Investors judge your leadership potential
based on your ability to drive a conversation, not just your slide
deck. A winning 30-minute call requires a strict psychological
sequence: Intro, Context, Proof, Ask, and Next Steps. Do not wait for
the VC to lead the discussion. You set the agenda, you frame the
problem, and you define exactly what happens after the call ends.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 WHY SAAS COMPANIES SHOULD OWN THEIR PAYMENT PROCESS (SPONSOR) [9] 

 If you allow an external provider to display their branding on your
checkout, you're disrupting the customer journey and promoting another
brand instead of your own. Learn how to avoid these common mistakes in
NMI's guide to white-label payments [9]. Want to see how embedded
payments will work in your app? Get a demo (or sandbox account) [10] 

 TRUE3D BANNERS (TOOL) [11] 

 Turn your existing image or video creative into an interactive ad
that reduces CPC by 30%. 

 CLOVER SECURITY (TOOL) [12] 

 Design-led product security with AI agents that act like experienced
security architects and extend the team's reach. 

 RUNLLM (TOOL) [13] 

 RunLLM is an AI agent that resolves technical issues by reading logs
and code.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE AWKWARD EXIT: $150M TO $300M ACQUISITIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A $200M exit is often life-changing for a founder but a failure for a
Series C investor. This "Grey Zone" creates boardroom deadlock. Early
investors (Seed/Series A) are happy with a 5x return, while late-stage
funds that underwrote a $1B outcome may block the sale to avoid a
write-down. The solution: negotiate secondary sales during your growth
rounds. 

 SILICON VALLEY BUILDS AMAZON AND GMAIL COPYCATS TO TRAIN AI AGENTS (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Several Silicon Valley startups have spent the past several months
recreating popular websites so AI systems can learn to navigate the
internet and complete specific tasks on their own. If an AI system
learns to use a replica of the site, it can use the real site, too.
The shadow sites are a significant part of the tech industry's efforts
to transform chatbots into AI agents. Many companies believe that AI
agents will be able to replace some white-collar workers in the coming
years.

 A BETA IS LIKE INVITING GUESTS OVER (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The main advantage of a beta is not research - it is basic hygiene.

 Optimization often masks itself as productivity. 

 JEFF BEZOS ON THE 4 PRINCIPLES THAT DIFFERENTIATED AMAZON (2 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Amazon's edge comes from four simple habits: obsessing over
customers, inventing instead of copying, thinking in 5–7 year
horizons, and taking operations seriously.
