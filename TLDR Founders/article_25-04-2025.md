HEADLINES & TRENDS

 AI 2027 (25 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A speculative look at how AI might evolve over the next few years,
from clumsy "order a burrito" assistants to superhuman research AIs
transforming industries and reshaping geopolitics, kicking off a Cold
War-style competition for compute and talent. 

 A16Z PARTNER ANDREW CHEN ON CONSUMER STARTUPS (20 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Andrew Chen from Andreessen Horowitz highlighted the rapid
acceleration of technology adoption and its impact on consumer
startups using historical examples like the Michelin Guide and modern
analogs such as viral marketing and content strategies. He noted
emerging opportunities in areas like video technology,
offline-to-online channels, and innovations in autonomous vehicles and
augmented reality. 

 AI AS NORMAL TECHNOLOGY (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article pushes back on the hype—and fear—around AI,
suggesting it's more like electricity or the internet than a runaway
superintelligence. Instead of imagining sci-fi scenarios, it argues
we'll see gradual but powerful impacts, giving us plenty of time (and
tools) to adapt. Rather than worrying about runaway AI scenarios, the
authors propose focusing on realistic risks like accidents, misuse,
and systemic harms, addressing these through existing regulatory
frameworks and downstream safeguards.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO DO SCENARIO MODELING (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When Uber was losing money, scenario modeling identified a path to
profitability—even when experts were skeptical. This guide walks
through how scenario modeling works, showing exactly what's needed to
achieve targets like "$1B in revenue" or "profitable growth." It
includes step-by-step instructions and a real-world example: improving
margins in a food delivery business. 

 A DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO MARKETING ATTRIBUTION (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many startups waste marketing dollars because they don't properly
track campaign impact. The fix: track your spending not just at the
channel level (like Google Ads or Meta), but at the campaign level.
Real attribution means knowing exactly which marketing dollars drive
revenue and scaling accordingly. Skip overly simplistic models (like
first or last touch), and avoid siloed data.

MISCELLANEOUS

 UNTAPPED POTENTIAL: INVESTING IN EMERGING SECTORS (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Investing in emerging sectors like biotech, AI, fintech, healthcare,
and climate tech offers growth opportunities but comes with inherent
risks. These sectors are at the forefront of technological
advancements and may benefit from government incentives and corporate
investments. 

 CONVERSATION QUALITY AND SCALE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Teams often nail communication in small groups but struggle when
expanding. Great conversations at scale require balancing autonomy
(local) and coordination (global). Prioritize minimal formal
structure—just enough to guide interactions, not so much that it
slows everyone down. Watch out if your team sounds rushed,
disconnected, or overly scripted, it likely means you've drifted too
far in one direction. Healthy teams design interactions thoughtfully,
creating clarity without stifling agility. 

 YOU'RE WASTING YOUR WARM INTROS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Most warm intros fail because the sender sounds insincere or generic.
Persuasive intros come down to sincerity and anticipating questions
the reader cares about: Why me? Why now? What's the benefit for me
specifically? Avoid entitlement and boilerplate messages. Instead,
personalize just enough to make the recipient feel genuinely valued.
Good intros balance sincerity, subtlety, and empathy—never assume
your referrer's credibility alone can seal the deal.
