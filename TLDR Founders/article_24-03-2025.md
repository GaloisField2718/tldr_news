 SHIP EVERY INTEGRATION YOUR CUSTOMERS NEED 7X FASTER (SPONSOR) [4] 

 By integrating your product deeply into customers' tech stack, you'll
create a better user experience and make your product much stickier.

In fact, 92% of SaaS companies [5] say their customers with
integrations enabled are less likely to churn*.

The need for integrations is even more prevalent in the age of AI,
where ingesting customers' 3rd-party data and automating tasks across
their workflow are key product enablers.

But you can't afford to build each integration in-house.

On average, it takes 3+ months for engineering to build a robust
integration - time that should be spent on your core product and
differentiators.

That's why Copy.ai, AI21, tl;dv and 200+ SaaS companies use Paragon's
embedded integration platform [4], so they can ship integrations 7x
faster while innovating ahead of their market.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 STUBHUB IPO: S1 BREAKDOWN (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 StubHub's IPO filing shows a healthy ticket marketplace making $1.77B
in revenue (up 29%) with strong profits. The company takes a solid 20%
cut of its $8.7B in ticket sales while generating 14% free cash flow.
The business works because people need tickets to events they don't
want to miss and are willing to pay premium fees. With 30 million
buyers spending about $250 per order, StubHub is looking at an $8-10B
valuation as it heads to the public market. 

 M&A ROARS BACK (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tech M&A is surging in 2025's first quarter with eight major deals
totaling over $45 billion, including Google's $32B acquisition of Wiz
and ServiceNow's $2.9B purchase of Moveworks. This uptick suggests a
potential shift back to inorganic growth as established cloud
companies face slowing expansion. The window may be especially
valuable for "zombie" point solutions stuck at $100-300M in revenue
that could thrive as part of larger platforms. 

 COPY COPY REVOLUTION (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI coding tools write verbose, repetitive code that experienced
programmers find inefficient and inelegant. However, what if this
approach is actually better for machines? Human engineers prefer code
that's abstracted and reused because we can only keep a few things in
our heads at once, while AI can manage thousands of separate pieces
with ease. Instead of forcing AI to write "good" code by human
standards (DRY, abstracted, and component-based), perhaps we should
embrace its preference for "radically simple" code—where each
function does exactly one thing without complex interconnections. This
approach might actually create more reliable software, even if it
looks messy to our eyes.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CUT THROUGH THE NOISE: FINDING THE RIGHT SALES METRICS (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 When inheriting a sales team with mountains of data, avoid analysis
paralysis by following this simple four-step process: First, model
your funnel using basic volume, conversion, and time
metrics—focusing on raw data without cherry-picking or making
assumptions. Next, find your performance bottleneck (like low
lead-to-opportunity conversion) and break it down by segments and reps
to spot patterns. Then talk to your team and customers to understand
why things were done certain ways before. Finally, resist implementing
twenty changes at once—pick 2 to 3 things that will directly impact
your biggest bottleneck, reinforce them relentlessly, and then move to
the next problem.

 COMMIT AND ACKNOWLEDGE: A GROWTH-STAGE CEO'S DECISION TO HIRE A COO

A COO can streamline operations, enabling founders to focus on
strategic priorities and reducing bottlenecks in decision-making. This
strategic partnership requires trust and self-awareness but can
significantly enhance company performance and leadership
effectiveness.

 THE WISDOM OF BILL GURLEY (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This post explores the structural factors that have led to the
relative decline of the United States in areas such as AI,
semiconductor fabrication, arguing that tariffs are not the answer.
The author then makes suggestions at the policy and industry level to
maintain global American competitiveness. 

 MCP (MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL): SIMPLY EXPLAINED IN 5 MINUTES (5 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT
integrate with your everyday apps—turning them from isolated
chatbots into powerful assistants with real-world capabilities.
Instead of copying error logs into your AI, MCP lets you simply say
"read my browser console and fix this bug" and the AI can directly
access those tools. Behind the scenes, MCP works through a standard
interface where providers like Slack, GitHub, and Sentry create
"adapters" that translate AI requests into API calls. 

 ALL PRETTY MODELS ARE WRONG, BUT SOME UGLY MODELS ARE USEFUL (8
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Models can be useful even when they're wrong about how the world
works—ancient Mayans predicted eclipses with remarkable accuracy
despite their laughable cosmology. Similarly, our business frameworks
should be judged on usefulness, not attractiveness. Be suspicious of
conveniently symmetrical models with exactly four quadrants, ten
bullet points, or perfectly balanced categories—humans, companies,
and markets are messy and asymmetrical. Good frameworks embrace this
complexity rather than forcing reality into neat diagrams that look
good in PowerPoint.
