HEADLINES & TRENDS

 FIGMA FILES REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR PROPOSED INITIAL PUBLIC
OFFERING (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 After confidentially submitting its S-1 to the SEC in April, Figma
has now made it public and will list on NYSE under ticker
"FIG"—marking the first major design tool IPO. Figma hasn't revealed
share price or offering size yet, but the move signals confidence in
the market for collaborative design software after years of
speculation about when it would go public. 

 GRAMMARLY ACQUIRES AI EMAIL CLIENT SUPERHUMAN (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Grammarly acquired the AI email client Superhuman to enhance its
productivity suite. Superhuman's team, including CEO Rahul Vohra, will
join Grammarly to integrate AI agents into email functionalities. The
acquisition follows Grammarly's recent $1 billion funding boost from
General Catalyst. 

 THE GREAT DIFFERENTIATION (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 When AI made it trivially easy to copy any website design or
marketing campaign, many companies started doing things that can't be
copied—like Robinhood filming product announcements at French
châteaus or Stripe building an actual Irish pub for its podcast. The
lesson is counterintuitive but powerful: in an age where digital
copying is free, the only way to stand out is to create experiences so
physical, so expensive, or so authentically weird that competitors
can't fake them even if they tried.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE BRAND THAT TURNED WATER INTO $1.4 BILLION (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mike Cessario watched musicians at Warped Tour refilling Monster
Energy cans with water to stay hydrated - they wanted to look cool,
not healthy. So he asked, 'What's the dumbest name for water?' Liquid
Death. Now people crack open "Mango Chainsaw" and "Berry It Alive"
because holding that skull-covered can makes them feel badass. Turns
out making water feel rebellious is worth $1.4 billion - who knew
boring products just needed better packaging? 

 HOW GRANOLA AI GROWS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 You look at Granola and think "another AI meeting notebook," then see
10% weekly growth and get confused. How did it win in a market with
20+ competitors? Granola realized everyone was solving the wrong
problem. Competitors assumed people wanted perfect AI transcripts, but
Granola noticed something: people actually like taking notes - it
helps them pay attention. They just miss stuff. So instead of
replacing note-taking, the company enhanced it. VCs loved it because
it worked invisibly (no embarrassing bot joining calls) and made their
scattered notes actually useful. 

 DO YOU NEED A CAIO? THE RISE OF THE CHIEF AI OFFICER IN 2025 (17
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Organizations are increasingly appointing Chief AI Officers (CAIOs)
to lead cross-functional AI strategy. This role requires bridging
technology with business, overseeing governance, and managing
AI-related risks and innovations. Companies benefit from a CAIO to
ensure AI efforts align with broader business goals and compliance
standards.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NO MORE PAINTING BY NUMBERS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Building with AI is hard because it breaks every mental model we have
about software—you can't assume it will work consistently, design
paradigms don't exist yet, and users don't understand what it can do.
The end result is that the decade-old "SaaS playbook" is dead, leaving
both startups and incumbents with a blank sheet of paper instead of
the familiar coloring book they've been painting by numbers in for
years. 

 WHY INVESTORS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 VCs keep passing on profitable businesses because they're not looking
for good companies - they need potential 100x returns. Since IPOs
dried up, everyone's chasing AI startups and hyping valuations through
secondary sales. If you take VC money, their moonshot business model
becomes yours, whether you like it or not.
