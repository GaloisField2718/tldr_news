HEADLINES & TRENDS

 DECEMBER INFLATION REPORT (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Markets reacted positively to lighter-than-expected December
inflation data, with the Nasdaq jumping 2.3% on the news. Core CPI
came in at 3.2% YoY (vs 3.3% consensus), while Core PPI dropped to
2.4% YoY (vs 2.7% consensus). Against fears of re-accelerating
inflation, the data suggests the Fed's approach is working. The report
includes a detailed analysis of changing rate expectations that show
how Trump's election and recent economic data have shifted market
sentiment. SaaS valuations remain resilient with the overall median
multiple at 6.3x and high-growth companies commanding 9.2. 

 THE REAL STATE OF THE VENTURE MARKET (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The venture landscape faces a sobering reality, with 70% of exits
happening at pre-seed and seed stages. While top-tier funds continue
to raise mega-funds, the inventory of aging startups keeps building.
Legendary investor Howard Marks draws parallels to the 2000 bubble,
warning that "too much optimism on the new thing leads to pricing
errors" - though markets appear frothy rather than completely
irrational. 

 THE VENTURE CAPITAL UNBUNDLING (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Top venture capital investors are launching their own boutique funds
in record numbers, moving away from mega-funds' focus on managing
ever-larger pools of capital. While established firms like a16z and
General Catalyst raise increasingly massive funds, former partners
like Mark Goldberg (Index), Kristina Shen (a16z), and Ethan Kurzweil
(Bessemer) have started Chemistry Ventures with a clear mission to
"out-hustle legacy firms distracted by scale." The industry's pursuit
of "2% of the biggest number" has transformed venture capital from
hands-on company building to pure asset management, creating an
opening for investors who want to return to the early days of working
closely with founders.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 9 WAYS TO GET YOUR FIRST 50 SAAS CUSTOMERS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A tactical guide for early-stage founders mixing traditional and
emerging customer acquisition channels. Rather than defaulting to
expensive paid ads, it advocates for starting with network sales, warm
intros, and targeted content marketing. The guide includes specific
templates and processes. 

 HOW TO TURN WARM REFERRALS INTO A SALES ENGINE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most B2B companies treat warm introductions as lucky breaks, but
Shreesh Naik has developed a systematic process to generate them
consistently. The approach uses LinkedIn Sales Navigator to map
second-degree connections, asks connectors for multiple introductions
at once, and builds regular weekly habits around outreach. Early
adopters report transforming sporadic referrals into a predictable
source of high-quality opportunities. 

 ALL YOUR MODELS ARE DESTROYED — THE RISE AND FUTURE FALL OF
MICROSTRATEGY (73 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MicroStrategy trades at a significant premium to its net assets.
Driven by narratives of high "Bitcoin yield," which is funded mainly
by new investor money, this structure resembles a Ponzi scheme, as
late investors risk substantial losses when the investor pool shrinks.
With management and the company treasury selling shares, the
sustainability of the current trading premium is highly questionable.

 OKRS FOR EVIL AND GOOD (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OKRs should be used as guides rather than strict metrics, avoiding
the pitfall of focusing solely on quantifiable results that may
overlook broader objectives. Honeycomb emphasizes using OKRs as cues
for team discussions and aligning with larger goals, without tying
them directly to performance reviews. This approach keeps the focus on
achieving meaningful outcomes rather than just meeting numerical
targets. 

 $132K - $149K, HERE'S WHAT SEED-STAGE FOUNDERS PAY EARLY EMPLOYEES,
BASED ON DATA (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Kruze Consulting's analysis of seed-stage startups shows founders'
salaries are generally lower than engineering roles, with CEOs earning
$132,000 and CTOs $134,000. Senior engineers in the Bay Area can make
between $180,000 and $235,000, while initial employee equity ranges
from 0.5% to 4% based on Carta data. Founders typically increase their
pay after raising further investment rounds. 

 ASK HN: PRACTICAL TIPS TO STAY PRODUCTIVE? (22 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Timeboxing and task prioritization strategies are gaining traction
among tech professionals to boost productivity and motivation.
Eliminating distractions, such as social media and unessential tasks,
can improve focus and efficiency. Techniques like breaking down tasks
and leveraging environmental controls are recommended to combat
procrastination and maintain progress on projects.
