 IF YOU'RE BUILDING IN 2025, YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT USAGE-BASED
PRICING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Moving to UBP isn't just a pricing change—it's a fundamental shift
in how revenue is generated, products are designed, and teams are
incentivized. Learn exactly how to do this from CEO and co-founder
Scott Woody in Metronome's new usage-based pricing playbook [4]:

 	* How to shift from legacy pricing models to UBP
 	* Why having a Chief Alignment Officer is non-negotiable
 	* Fixing the value metric and testing everything else
 	* Over-communicating changes with customers

It's practical, packed with case studies and best practices, and
completely free to read [4] (no registration required).

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 2024 VC FUND PERFORMANCE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The venture capital market has changed since the 2022 boom. The
median LP count for funds between $100-250M dropped nearly 50% (from
83 to 47). Remaining LPs now write larger anchor checks. Performance
data shows declining returns across all vintages—funds from
2017-2020 have lower median IRRs, with the 2017 vintage falling from
16.8% in Q4 2021 to 12.0% by Q4 2024. Smaller funds show better top
performance (2018 vintage funds under $10M have 4.03x TVPI at the 90th
percentile versus 1.67x for funds over $100M), though many funds still
struggle with distributions—half of 2018 vintage funds have yet to
return any capital to investors. 

 THE NEW AI RISK CURVE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI startups grow faster but fade faster too. They can reach $50M ARR
quickly but might shrink in year four as their lead vanishes. Unlike
past tech eras where physical infrastructure (on-premise) or
engineering teams (cloud) created barriers to entry, AI tools make it
easy for competitors to catch up at any point. This creates a new risk
curve where impressive growth numbers no longer guarantee lasting
success as technology keeps shifting under everyone's feet. 

 COREWEAVE'S IPO DISAPPOINTS, INFLATION COMES IN HOT (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, priced below its target
range at $40 per share. It raised $1.46 billion by selling 36.5
million shares, but missed its initial $47-55 range after concerns
about datacenter overcapacity dampened enthusiasm. Meanwhile,
inflation ticked up with February PCE hitting 2.5% year-over-year and
core PCE reaching 2.8%—both above expectations and worrying given
upcoming auto tariffs.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE PATH TO PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Small AI startups now achieve hypergrowth without massive funding or
hiring sprees. Four ingredients make this possible: intense demand
(when markets pull your product because it solves urgent problems
better), a repeatable unit (one customer type, one product, one
process), scalable pipeline (one reliable lead source plus
word-of-mouth), and compression (constantly making your customer
journey 50% faster and easier). Master these elements and you can
build an efficient growth machine with minimal overhead. 

 INSIDE FIGMA'S PRICING EVOLUTION (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post explains how to fix pricing as you add products. Figma
moved from charging separately for each product to a simpler system
with three seat types based on user needs. This solved a common
founder challenge—how to expand your product line without creating
pricing chaos. The new model (Collab, Dev, and Full seats) kept things
clear for customers while enabling a 20-35% price increase for power
users and driving the adoption of newer tools like Slides. 

 STORYTELLING IS THE ‘MAKE OR BREAK' SKILL FOUNDERS ARE LACKING (7
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Despite available VC dry powder, 2025 may see another wave of failed
startups due to fundraising challenges. Startups will struggle to gain
attention, especially non-AI companies. Early-stage founders often
neglect effective storytelling. Founders must articulate compelling
narratives to differentiate themselves, drive investment, and build
credibility.

 SHARED UNDERSTANDING AT SCALE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Stop drowning in team confusion with five practical fixes: cut unused
"strategy layers" that nobody references, design simple formats for
sharing updates, create different dashboards for different roles,
accept that some teams move faster than others, and pick frameworks
that show real problems instead of hiding them. Teams that follow
these rules make better decisions because they see what's actually
happening instead of getting lost in complicated planning documents
that nobody reads. 

 FIRST SHAREHOLDER LETTERS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The first shareholder letter sets the tone for a company's entire
public journey. Steve Jobs emphasized Pixar's focus on "pictures, not
quarters," Larry Page warned Google investors about "lumpy" results
from long-term bets, and Jeff Bezos declared Amazon would sacrifice
"GAAP accounting" for future cash flows. These letters reveal what
truly matters to founders—Jamie Dimon's demand for "the highest
standards" at Bank One and Steven Rales' insistence on "simple,
understandable businesses" at Danaher showed their strategic DNA
before success proved them right.
