HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHAT WENT WRONG AT TECHSTARS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Techstars was once one of the world‚Äôs leading accelerator programs,
but it has steadily been eclipsed by Y Combinator. Recent executive
departures and program closures, such as the termination of its
flagship Seattle program, signal major challenges within the company.
Chris DeVore, the former MD of Techstars Seattle, provides an
insider's perspective on the strategic choices that contributed to
Techstars' downfall. 

 A SHARP DIVIDE IN VALUATIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In Q4 2023, the venture capital landscape displayed a significant
divergence in valuation trends. Early-stage startups, especially those
at the Series A level, witnessed a substantial increase in their
median pre-money valuations, highlighting growth in earlier phases. On
the contrary, more mature startups, particularly those in Series C,
experienced a significant decline in step-up multiples, reaching a
five-year low of 1.16x. This indicates a challenging market
environment for later-stage companies moving forward. 

 WHY FOUNDER VESTING NEEDS REINVENTING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 It‚Äôs frustrating when founders, who have slogged through nearly a
decade of company building, end up with a small slice of the pie
because early co-founders or employees vested large equity stakes and
departed before things started working. To avoid this, extend the
vesting schedule to six years or more. This ensures co-founders or
early employees who don‚Äôt work out in the long term don‚Äôt leave
you with too little.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TARGETING AN ICP BRINGS 10X MORE CUSTOMERS (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Speaking to everyone in your messaging means speaking to no one. As
counterintuitive as it seems, positioning around ultra-specific
personas doesn't push away other customers. Instead, this clear
targeting communicates natural purchasing trade-offs. 

 HOW FOUNDERS CAN REACH $100M ARR (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The term "unicorn" was coined in 2013 by Cowboy Ventures to describe
a startup worth more than $1 billion. At that time, there were only 39
unicorns ‚Äì today there are 523. In the future, the herd will thin
out, and the most valuable startups will be those that build for
enterprises. A $100 million annual recurring revenue is now the new
signal of value. This article outlines steps to achieve that goal. 

 BUILD A WINNING SALES STRATEGY (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Carlos Delatorre, CRO of Harness, shares six rules of a winning sales
strategy that transcend industries: assess the new organizational
culture before taking action, be an internal champion for strategic
initiatives, implement quality control at scale through metrics,
assess for talent and grit in sales hires, invest in enablement
programs, and emphasize the irreplaceable value of product-led growth
(PLG) in sales efforts.

 HOW STARTUPS BEAT INCUMBENTS (22 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A startup can beat a large successful incumbent if it does things the
incumbent can not or will not do. This article examines the
vulnerabilities of incumbents and identifies opportunities startups
can exploit to win despite the incumbent's advantages. 

 DON‚ÄôT ASK, DON‚ÄôT GET (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Many of us often hesitate to express our thoughts due to the fear of
upsetting someone, be it an investor, employee, or co-founder.
However, in reality, once we speak our minds, the outcome may not be
as negative as we initially anticipated. More importantly, how you
convey your thoughts matters. This article explores a few tactics to
use if you need to speak your mind. 

 DEEP-DIVE INTO HADRIAN (27 MINUTE VIDEO) [17] 

 Last week, Hadrian, a prominent industrial automation startup that is
the poster child for American Dynamism, announced a $117M Series B
funding round. The Founder/CEO, Chris Power, recently sat down with
Founders Fund to discuss the details of the funding, the challenges of
competing with China, the benefits of combining manufacturing and
software talent, and the importance of America's success in the second
space race.

 THE YEAR OF SUB-$500M M&A (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 2024 might be a pivotal year for sub-$500M mergers and acquisitions.
Here are four strategic tips for founders aiming to navigate this
landscape and optimally position their companies for potential M&A
opportunities. 

 IS IT NORMAL FOR A STARTUP CEO TO END UP WITH JUST 10% EQUITY? (1
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Yes, this is the general outcome after 3 rounds of traditional VC
funding. If the company sells 15‚Äì20% in each round, and 15‚Äì20% is
reserved for employees, that typically will leave 15‚Äì25% for the
founders in total - but that could be still worth a lot. 

 DON‚ÄôT DELEGATE YOUR WORD (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 It can be tempting to outsource email responses, social posts, or
blog writing as you grow your business. Don‚Äôt do it - your voice
needs to be exactly that: yours.
