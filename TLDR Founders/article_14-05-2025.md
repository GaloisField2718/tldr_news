DECISIONS (SPONSOR) [4]

lack the intel to hire with confidence. If you're looking to close the
gap and learn the ins and outs of hiring in Mexico and LATAM, grab a
copy of the 2025 Tech Salaries Report [4] for:

Salary benchmarks by role, seniority, skills, region, and English
level.

Insights on mobility, remote preferences, DEI, turnover, and benefits.

Hiring trends, salary drivers, and time-to-fill benchmarks to help you
plan smarter and hire faster. 

BECAUSE BETTER DATA LEADS TO BETTER HIRES — AND BETTER TEAMS.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 FULL STACK STARTUPS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 YC wants founders to build "Full-stack AI Companies." These aren't
startups selling AI tools to law firms - they're actual law firms
using AI instead of lawyers. The math is simple. You could sell AI to
existing accounting firms, or just start your own AI-powered
accounting firm. Growth is slower than pure software, but margins are
way better than traditional services. An accounting firm typically
gets low exit multiples, but what about one using AI? The lines
between VC and PE are starting to blur. Venture has always chased new
tech, but now we're seeing money flow toward upgrading existing
industries with AI. 

 EVERYTHING IS TECHNOLOGY (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 How did Fifth Avenue transform from exclusively horse-drawn carriages
to automobiles in just 13 years? This pattern repeats throughout
history: new technology displaces incumbents faster than expected and
creates more value than imagined. Billion-dollar exits have become
merely 85th percentile outcomes for VCs. The mega venture funds that
seem excessive today are actually positioning for an unprecedented
reality – technology will systematically conquer every major
industry, creating tens of trillions in new value over the next decade


 POINTS OF FRICTION (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The VC industry faces "maximum change" as AI transforms coding from
craft to automated service. The traditional model of funding large
engineering teams is dying. As software creation becomes frictionless,
valuable startups will tackle what remains difficult – selling to
complex industries or building supplier networks others can't
replicate.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW PERPLEXITY GROWS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Perplexity's quest to replace Google is working through brilliantly
designed growth loops. Its AskPerplexity feature lets users tag the
company in social posts across Twitter, Discord, WhatsApp, and
Telegram, creating viral visibility with every interaction. Instead of
forcing signups like competitors, it lets users experience value
before creating accounts. Its collaborative features, like Spaces and
watchlists, make search accessible anywhere conversations happen. 

 WHY ROMANTICIZING PLG IS DANGEROUS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Even celebrated "no sales" darlings like Atlassian quietly employ
hundreds of sales professionals to land complex enterprise deals. The
AI boom has supercharged the product-led growth (PLG) narrative to
dangerous extremes. Despite stories of companies hitting $50M ARR with
"zero salespeople," successful PLG companies still employ significant
sales teams. Relying solely on self-service creates serious
limitations. 

 4 UNEXPECTED LEARNINGS FROM KLAVIYO (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Klaviyo reached $1B ARR with 35% annual growth by focusing on unique
marketing automation solutions for e-commerce. Supported by customer
advocacy and strong Shopify integration, its strategic growth includes
global expansion, targeting enterprise clients, and broadening beyond
commerce. Klaviyo's successful IPO reflects its sustainable growth and
market leadership in the Shopify ecosystem with over 50% market
penetration.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 HOW TO MAKE BYOD SECURE AND COMPLIANT WITHOUT MANAGING DEVICES OR
VIRTUAL DESKTOPS (SPONSOR) [13] 

 As a startup, you don't want to manage laptops or deal with the
complexity of VDI. But BYOD can create compliance challenges. Venn
[14] solves them by creating a Secure Enclave on your remote workers'
personal device - isolating and protecting company apps and data from
any personal use. No file transfers, copy/paste, or screenshots inside
their secure workspace. For PC or Mac. Start here [14] 

 PROPOLIS (TOOL) [15] 

 Propolis simulates real users via swarms of autonomous browser
agents. 

 EFFIE (TOOL) [16] 

 Effie is a writing companion with AI-powered templates and 1,000+
prompts. It is designed to spark creativity and keep your ideas synced
across devices. 

 SOLVER (TOOL) [17] 

 Solver is an autonomous coding agent that completes software tasks
directly in your git repositories, from bug fixes to new features.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE PERVERSE INCENTIVES OF VIBE CODING (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AI coding assistants operate on variable-ratio reinforcement – that
unpredictable "sometimes it works brilliantly" pattern that triggers
dopamine like gambling. One developer spent over $1,000 "vibe coding"
and discovered a perverse economic incentive: AI companies charge by
token count, so verbose code generates more revenue. 

 CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACES: THE GOOD, THE UGLY & THE BILLION-DOLLAR
OPPORTUNITY (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Good design feels obvious to use. ChatGPT exploded in popularity
because its messaging interface tapped into patterns we've known since
childhood – we send 25 billion texts daily! However, intuitive
doesn't mean optimal. In this post, Julie Zhuo (ex-Facebook VP)
identifies five critical flaws in today's conversational UIs and
suggests a billion-dollar opportunity in personalizing how information
is presented to match your unique learning style, not just what
content you see. 

 PRAISE OUR LORD FOR SECONDARY MARKETS, BECAUSE SELLING SHARES IS NOW
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF (SEED) VENTURE CAPITAL (6 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Seed stage VCs are shifting from a "buy and hold" strategy to
considering secondary sales due to prolonged timelines to exit,
alignment gaps, and changing market dynamics. This shift enables
better capital recycling and supports portfolios by addressing
liquidity needs. Secondary sales are becoming a primary method for
returning capital to LPs as the venture landscape evolves.
