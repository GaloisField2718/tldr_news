 WHAT TO EXPECT WITH DILUTION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article discusses the dilution founders face when raising
capital through various funding rounds, using data from over 43,000 US
companies on the Carta platform. The standard advice of selling 20% in
early-stage rounds remains. Founders have been selling less of their
companies over the past four years. Challenges like bridge financings
and investor-friendly deal terms can significantly increase dilution. 

 BUILDING COMPANIES ON CAMPUS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article shares the unique challenges and opportunities faced by
student founders, emphasizing the importance of choosing the right
co-founder based on trust, solving problems they are passionate about,
and leveraging their position as students to access resources and
networks. 

 DON‚ÄôT TAKE FREE CASH FLOW AT FACE VALUE (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 It is important to scrutinize the underlying factors of free cash
flow (FCF) margins in software companies. Founders should be wary of
taking headline FCF numbers at face value due to the potential for
non-structural factors to temporarily inflate these figures. A deeper
analysis of FCF components, such as stock-based compensation and
changes in net working capital, can help you understand a company's
true profitability and the sustainability of its FCF improvements.
