HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE NEW RULES FOR FUNDRAISING IN THE AI ERA (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Vivek Ramaswami and colleagues at Madrona outline how AI has
disrupted traditional fundraising benchmarks. Rapid spikes in user
growth and revenue no longer signal durable success, so investors now
focus on momentum, unit economics, clear expansion pathways, and
customer dependence. Founders must prove that growth is sustainable,
customers are genuinely locked in, and their business has a defensible
trajectory rather than just hitting arbitrary ARR milestones. 

 WHAT'S WORKING IN AI FOR GTM (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 53% of GTM leaders are seeing little to no impact from AI. This
report interviewed 30 who are and compiled 40 of their best workflows
across content, prospecting, and sales. Most can be built with ChatGPT
or Claude plus off-the-shelf tools. The report walks through
step-by-step examples with exact prompts.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PMF IS A LAGGING INDICATOR. START WITH HABIT FORMATION INSTEAD (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Grant Lee argues that Product-Market Fit is a lagging metric and
advises founders to focus first on whether they are building recurring
habits rather than one-off solutions. By targeting frequent,
low-friction problems and designing products that users invest in
quickly, startups can create sticky behaviors that drive long-term
engagement. Examples like Slack and Gamma illustrate how habit-focused
design outperforms solutions that only address infrequent or
high-friction needs. 

 BUILDING AI PRODUCTS: LESSONS FROM PRODUCTBOARD SPARK (22 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The fundamentals of product management haven't changed. Building AI
products is still about solving real problems for real people. Start
by matching customer pain to tech capabilities, build prototypes fast,
measure quality rigorously, and evolve your team as you scale. The
teams that ship great AI products will be the ones that learned
fastest from what didn't work.

functional, secure, and scalable applications with built-in cloud

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE FUNDABILITY TRAP (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Fundability is the measure of how well a startup fits with the
current venture consensus. Investability is a measure of potential
outcome and financial return. VCs that conflate the two or don't
recognize the difference risk building an entire ecosystem that
rewards fundability. Chasing fundability over investability has never
been a reliable path to outlier outcomes and fund returns. 

 SOFTWARE IN A POST-ABUNDANCE WORLD (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI is transforming software production by making it cheaper and
faster, leading to smaller teams, reduced margins, and shifting value
from code creation to decision-making and integration. This shift
challenges old economic models where large teams thrived under
abundant capital and growth incentives, pushing the industry towards
leaner operations and disposable software. Capital now focuses on
leveraging AI in areas like healthcare and manufacturing, where
software integration with domain expertise is harder to replicate,
refining the industry's focus from quantity to strategic depth and
adaptability.
