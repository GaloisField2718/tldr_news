 THE SOFTWARE'S VALUE PROPOSITION IS CHANGING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Value used to be about what software could offer (think Microsoft
Office licenses). Then it was about what it enabled (Adobe Creative
Cloud). With AI, we are entering a new era where THE VALUE OF SOFTWARE
IS WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES (think OpenAI charging by tokens used to
generate content).

Companies must be ready for this change, but many monetization models
are stuck in the past [4].  Read more about how the three eras of
software value are now calling for companies to evolve—and the cost
of staying behind—on the Metronome blog [4].

P.S. Later this month, Metronome will release a full whitepaper on
this topic: _The_ _Monetization Operation Model_. Get early access [5]

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 NVIDIA-BACKED FIREWORKS AI RACES TO $4B VALUATION WITH LIGHTSPEED,
INDEX VENTURES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Fireworks AI surged to a $4 billion valuation with its
high-performance AI inference technology, optimized for PyTorch and
open-source models. The company provides faster and more
cost-effective deployments than traditional cloud providers, with
partnerships including Google Cloud and NVIDIA bolstering its
position. Upcoming funding will support further development of
"compound AI systems" and global expansion, positioning Fireworks for
a potential IPO. 

 QUINCE, A BRIGHT SPOT IN STRUGGLING D2C FASHION SPACE, MORE THAN
DOUBLES VALUATION TO $4.5B WITH SECOND RAISE IN 6 MONTHS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Quince, an affordable luxury DTC brand, raised $200 million at a $4.5
billion valuation, doubling in six months. Iconiq Capital led the
round, boosting Quince's total funding to $461.5 million. Despite
challenges in the D2C sector, Quince stands out with fast-growing
revenue and popularity among Gen Z and millennials due to its
affordable pricing. 

 THE MAKING OF DARIO AMODEI (32 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, has been vocal about AI's rapid
progression and its potential risks and opportunities, predicting
significant job impacts while advocating for AI safety measures and
regulations. Anthropic, valued at $61 billion, has shifted focus from
consumer applications like ChatGPT to supplying AI models to
businesses, primarily through APIs, which has driven fast revenue
growth. Amodei's dedication to AI safety stems from personal tragedy,
and he navigates industry skepticism while pursuing rapid AI
advancements, believing in the transformative potential of AI,
particularly in medical and scientific fields.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LINEAR'S PATH TO PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Karri Saarinen hated Jira so much at Airbnb that he built a Chrome
extension to redesign it - 100 coworkers installed it. That hack
became Linear, now worth $1.25B. The Finnish founders spent a year
validating through bar conversations before building. They gated
access obsessively, handpicking 10 users weekly from 10,000 waitlist
signups. While competitors chase flexibility, Linear ships opinionated
defaults. It hit profitability in 2021 with just 80 employees by
choosing quality over growth metrics. 

 THE MERE URGENCY EFFECT — WHY WE CHOOSE TASKS THAT FEEL MORE URGENT
(3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 You abandon writing a $5,000 sales page to answer a dinner text
because your brain prioritizes time-sensitive tasks over important
ones. Researchers proved this by offering people five Hershey's Kisses
or three - when they added a 10-minute deadline to the smaller reward,
participants choosing it jumped from 13% to 31%. 

 THE MILLION-DOLLAR EXPERIMENT: HOW GITHUB BOOSTED CONVERSIONS WITH A
SINGLE FLOW CHANGE (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Most developers didn't even know GitHub had paid features - they
thought it was just open source. When Thibault Imbert watched users
sign up, they picked free by default because GitHub hid what paid
plans offered. Inspired by Grammarly's transparent signup flow, his
team redesigned everything. Instead of hiding paid features, they
showed exactly what was free versus paid, segmented by user type, and
wrote copy like developers talking to developers. The results shocked
them - 35% more paid conversions, worth over $1 million in ARR. They
were so surprised they double-checked the analytics. CEO Nat Friedman
loved it because it felt natural, not pushy. The lesson is
counterintuitive - being honest about pricing actually increases
conversions when you respect your users' intelligence.

 THE CHAINSMOKERS' MANTIS VC CLOSES $100M THIRD FUND (1 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Mantis VC, co-founded by The Chainsmokers, raised $100 million for
its third fund, 25% more than its previous $80 million fund. Despite
its celebrity status, Mantis focuses on B2B startups, with investments
in companies like Chainguard and Rogo. It leverages its extensive
network from private shows for Fortune 500 companies for valuable
customer introductions. 

 HOW THE SYSTEM OF RECORD DIES (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Everyone thinks AI agents will kill systems of record - why log in
Salesforce when agents do everything? David Peterson thinks that's
backwards. Agents need constraints and permissions, making systems of
record essential. However, the pricing power shifts. Companies will
pay for work, not data storage. When incumbents throttle APIs to
maintain revenue, customers revolt. The winners won't be today's
systems desperately locking down data - they'll be whoever builds
ground-up "systems of intelligence" without legacy baggage. 

 AI IS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR UNLIMITED SUBSCRIPTIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Anthropic got backlash for adding usage limits to Claude Max,
following similar issues with Cursor and Windsurf. It's always coding
tools that face pricing revolts. The problem is simple - coding
requires flow state, not paywalls interrupting a 5-hour feature build.
Running out of credits in an SEO tool works because it's discrete
tasks. However, limits mid-debug ruin the IDE experience. These
companies aren't being deceptive, they're stuck. AI costs too much for
unlimited subscriptions that developers want. Like expensive mobile
data in 2003, this will look ridiculous once cheaper models make
unlimited usage possible.

 DEFAULTS MATTER (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Your product's default settings determine success because AI agents
won't customize anything - they use whatever works out-of-the-box. 

 WHY SEED ROUNDS ARE GROWING AS STARTUPS SHRINK (1 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Writing $1M checks doesn't move the needle for a $500M fund - that's
why smaller seed rounds are vanishing. 

 YOUR MOST PROFITABLE FEATURES ARE THE ONES YOU FORGOT ABOUT (1 MINUTE
READ) [22] 

 80% of features in the average software product are never used, yet
founders keep shipping them anyway.
