 HOW MUCH DO REMOTE ENGINEERS MAKE? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Engineering hiring is booming again: U.S. companies with revenue of
$50 million+ are anticipating a 12% hiring increase compared with
2024. Employers and candidates are wondering: HOW DO REMOTE SOFTWARE
ENGINEER SALARIES COMPARE ACROSS GLOBAL MARKETS?

Terminal's Remote Software Engineer Salary Report [4] includes data
from 260K+ candidates across Latin America, Canada and Europe.
Employers can better inform hiring decisions and candidates can
understand their earning potential.

Our hiring expertise runs deep: Terminal is the smarter platform for
hiring remote engineers [5]. We hire elite engineering talent up to
60% cheaper than U.S. talent.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 INTRODUCING CODEX (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI just launched Codex, an autonomous coding agent that writes
features, fixes bugs, and submits pull requests in isolated cloud
environments. Companies like Cisco and Temporal are already using it
to handle entire codebases while their engineers focus on higher-level
work. The agent can tackle multiple tasks simultaneously, run tests,
and provide detailed citations of every change it makes. 

 CHIME IPO: S1 BREAKDOWN (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sometimes the most profitable customers are the ones everyone else
calls "unprofitable." Chime built a $1.67 billion business serving the
70% of Americans making under $100K - customers traditional banks
actively avoid. It isn't actually a bank - the company just handles
the customer experience while partners deal with regulatory headaches.
Users swipe 54 times monthly because Chime doesn't charge overdraft
fees. The model works: it earns money on every swipe without owning
the banking infrastructure. 

 GTM EFFICIENCY IS PLUMMETING! (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cloud companies are making record profits but burning more money to
get each new customer. Today's strong margins come from customers they
acquired cheaply years ago. Current sales teams cost way more to land
new deals. When those old, profitable customers eventually leave,
companies will replace them with expensive new ones. FCF margins look
great now, but will crash later unless sales efficiency improves.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO IDENTIFY AND INVEST IN TOP TALENT (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When you double team size, employee performance becomes harder to
track. Two frameworks can help: the 9-box model plots employees on
performance vs potential grids, while stack ranking forces leaders to
rank everyone from top to bottom. Both create uncomfortable but
necessary conversations about who deserves investment, coaching, or
exit plans. 

 HOW TO STOP HOLDING YOURSELF BACK (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Everyone stays muted on Zoom hoping nobody notices, but that is just
self-sabotage disguised as humility. We give ourselves "free passes"
to play small - staying silent in meetings, not negotiating offers,
waiting for perfect moments that never come. If you know what needs
changing in your role but haven't done it, you're giving away your
power. 

 FINDING "GOOD" DEMAND (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Two criteria separate fast growing startups from slow ones: First,
how likely is your solution to be the customer's #1 priority right
now? When a project tops their list (like Lovable for UI mockups or
Vanta for SOC 2 compliance), customers actively seek solutions.
Second, how dramatically better are you than alternatives?

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHEN CUSTOMERS BUY YOUR COMPETITOR'S PRODUCT… AND THEN BUY YOURS (9
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Enterprise sales doesn't have to mean 6 to 9 month long deals. 20
years ago, a hospital had million-dollar HP OpenView monitoring
software and also bought What's Up Gold for $500. Both do the same
thing. Its explanation: "What's Up Gold has features we use daily, and
$500 goes on the credit card without approval." No procurement
meetings, no sales cycles. Sometimes the back door is just pricing
under the credit card limit. 

 WHAT'S GOING ON WITH AI PROGRESS AND TRENDS? (14 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI progress stems from faster algorithmic advances and increased
compute for training, with the trend of training compute growth
expected to slow from 4.5x to around 3.5x annually. Returns to
pretraining are diminishing, shifting focus towards scaling up
reinforcement learning, though this brings its own challenges, like
environment scalability. Despite some bumps, notable algorithmic
improvements have accelerated to potentially 4.5x effective compute
per year, primarily driving advancements over merely increasing raw
compute. 

 THE SLOW DEATH OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Ever notice how everyone looks exactly the same now? Compare today's
algorithmic cloning to photos of individuals from the 70s-90s who
looked effortlessly chic in their own distinct ways. We've traded
browsing local boutiques for keyword bidding wars and influencer FOMO.
Now we scan, click, and purchase, becoming complicit in our own taste
erosion.
