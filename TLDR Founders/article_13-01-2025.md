HEADLINES & TRENDS

 RISING RATES (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Despite the Fed's rate cuts since September 2024, the 10-year
Treasury yield has climbed to 4.7%. This seemingly paradoxical rise
stems from three key factors: persistent inflation expectations driven
by wage growth and oil prices, surprisingly robust economic growth
with 3.2% GDP expansion, and renewed inflationary pressures from
Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. The combination suggests markets
are pricing in longer-term inflation risks despite the Fed's
accommodative stance. 

 WHAT'S CHANGING WITH AI MONETIZATION (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Recent shifts in AI pricing models show a move away from traditional
seat-based subscriptions toward more varied approaches. Companies like
OpenAI and Sierra are exploring higher-priced tiers ($200-500/month),
outcome-based pricing, and "AI FTE" models that position AI agents as
cheaper alternatives to human employees. The trend suggests companies
are still experimenting to find sustainable monetization strategies
that align with both value delivery and cost structures. 

 SAM ALTMAN-BACKED NUCLEAR STARTUP OKLO LANDS MASSIVE DATA CENTER
POWER DEAL, WITH CAVEATS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nuclear startup Oklo, backed by Sam Altman, has signed a non-binding
deal with Switch to supply 12 gigawatts of electricity from small
modular reactors by 2044. Oklo's challenge remains in obtaining NRC
approval after a prior denial, with plans to resubmit in 2025.
Competition from nuclear startups and cheaper renewable energy sources
poses additional hurdles.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BEING VAGUE IS COSTING YOU MONEY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The piece advocates for extreme specificity in business positioning,
using real examples to show how broad, generic statements like "I help
leaders learn to lead" fail to resonate with potential clients.
Through personal experience, the author demonstrates how refining his
pitch from "I help SaaS companies grow revenue" to targeting specific
company stages, industries, and revenue ranges dramatically improved
client acquisition. 

 THE #1 SKILL EVERY EXECUTIVE SHOULD HAVE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Mastering "high-low" work - balancing strategic, long-term
initiatives with immediate, tactical tasks - is key to reaching
executive levels and job security. Effective leaders excel at setting
future-oriented strategies while managing current metrics and
projects. Developing this skill involves intentional practice and can
distinguish indispensable executives from those who are expendable. 

 HOW TO (NOT) INVEST LIFE CHANGING MONEY (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A transparent look at how one founder managed his post-acquisition
windfall in 2020, comparing his DIY investing approach against Goldman
Sachs' wealth management. Despite Goldman's 0.73% annual fees and
"vanilla" portfolio strategy split between fixed income and equities,
its conservative 10% IRR matched the author's more aggressive 14% IRR
on his personal portfolio of venture funds, crypto, real estate, and
individual stocks. Even sophisticated founders can underperform simple
index investing in their quest for alpha during one of the market's
strongest bull runs.

 THE INEVITABILITY OF ADVERTISING (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Despite Perplexity's initial anti-advertising stance, its move to
introduce ads was predictable given business fundamentals. While the
company is attempting to maintain "clean" advertising by limiting
customization and data sharing, it faces significant challenges: a
smaller user base compared to Google, a specific demographic skew, and
potential difficulties in scaling audience reach before competitors
catch up. Businesses shouldn't be ashamed of sustainable revenue
models, but should be transparent about their evolution. 

 FACTORS TO LOOK INTO BEFORE HIRING DIGITAL MARKETING AGENCY FOR YOUR
STARTUP (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Many startups today outsource specific marketing projects,
particularly paid marketing campaigns, to digital marketing agencies.
However, the quality of service can vary significantly between
agencies. As a result, some startups experience underwhelming
performance, while others thrive and consistently generate revenue. 

 IDEAS FROM "A PHILOSOPHY OF SOFTWARE DESIGN" (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 John Ousterhout's book, "A Philosophy of Software Design," emphasizes
zero-tolerance towards complexity, arguing it accumulates from small
decisions. Smaller components aren't necessarily better for modularity
and can introduce unnecessary complexity. Exception handling is a
major source of complexity - simplifying it through aggregation and
masking can significantly reduce system complexity.
