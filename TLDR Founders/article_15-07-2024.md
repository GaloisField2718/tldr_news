HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHEN BUILDING A STARTUP GETS HARD, WHERE SHOULD WE TURN? (10 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 This deep dive into Clay's journey to (almost) unicorn status
challenges conventional startup wisdom, emphasizing the power of
founders' intuition and emotional core over rigid metrics and
strategies. For early-stage founders, it highlights the importance of
storytelling over spreadsheets, the value of relentless customer
focus, and the need to balance data-driven decisions with gut
instincts. 

 GOOGLE REPORTEDLY IN TALKS TO ACQUIRE CLOUD SECURITY COMPANY WIZ FOR
$23B (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Alphabet, Google's parent company, is reportedly in advanced
discussions to acquire cloud security firm Wiz for approximately $23
billion. The potential acquisition, which would be Alphabet's largest
to date, is seen as a strategic move to strengthen Google's growing
cloud business. Wiz, founded by former Microsoft employees, has raised
$1.9 billion in funding and boasts an annual recurring revenue of $350
million. 

 UNIT ECONOMICS PART II: BILLION DOLLAR WHACK-A-MOLE (10 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 On his first day as Head of FP&A, this author learned from the
founder that the previous employee was fired for constantly suggesting
price hikes regardless of the situation. The founder followed a
strategy focused on controlling costs rather than prices, believing
that maintaining the lowest unit costs would ensure long-term success.
This approach challenges conventional business wisdom but has proven
effective for the founder, who prioritizes customer satisfaction and
market-driven pricing.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW ANNUAL PRE-PAY CREATES AN INFINITE MARKETING BUDGET (12 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Offering annual billing plans can significantly improve a SaaS
company's cash flow by providing upfront revenue that covers customer
acquisition costs. This approach allows businesses to invest more in
growth without the need for additional funding, as the annual payments
from customers can be used to pay for marketing expenses before the
costs are actually incurred. While not all customers will choose
annual plans, even a portion of them doing so can have a
transformative effect on the company's financial position. 

 STARTING AN ANALYTICS ORG FROM SCRATCH (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This comprehensive guide from DoorDash's VP of Analytics outlines how
to build an analytics function from the ground up. It suggests
starting with generalist hires, focusing on business impact rather
than just data creation, and evolving the team's structure as the
company grows. For founders, it provides a roadmap for integrating
data-driven decision-making into their company's DNA from the early
stages, highlighting when and how to invest in analytics capabilities
at different growth stages. 

 METRICS DON'T MATTER (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Focusing on metrics in the early stages of a business can be
counterproductive, as it distracts from understanding the fundamental
reasons behind a single customer's decision to buy. Only after deeply
understanding and replicating the success story of one "hell yes"
customer should a business earn the right to care about metrics.

MISCELLANEOUS

 INTERVIEWING META CTO ANDREW BOSWORTH ON THE METAVERSE (21 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Andrew Bosworth of Meta discusses VR's evolution and the Quest's
success as a standalone headset, highlighting AI's role in Meta's
innovative future. Meta faced a lot of challenges on the way and still
does, like producing great content, costs, and therefore limited
accessibility for your everyday consumer. Its ongoing significant
investments show confidence that the company truly believes in VR/AR's
mainstream potential ‚Äì it's just going to take some time, but then
it'll likely happen all at once. 

 HOW AI AGENTS WILL CHANGE SOFTWARE PRICING (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 As AI agents become increasingly productive, software companies may
need to reevaluate their pricing models, considering alternatives such
as tripling per-seat prices, adopting usage-based pricing, or charging
based on performance outcomes. These new pricing strategies could
provide opportunities for startups to disrupt incumbents, similar to
how Salesforce challenged the perpetual license model with its
seat-based approach. 

 HOW TO HELP UNDERPERFORMERS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This guide offers a nuanced approach to managing underperformers,
emphasizing early intervention and gradual escalation. The
"Accountability Dial" framework provides a structured way to address
issues, from gentle mentions to more serious conversations. For
founders and managers, it highlights the importance of clear
expectations, consistent feedback, and a balance between
accountability and support.
