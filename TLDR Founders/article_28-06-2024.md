HEADLINES & TRENDS

 AI AS AN UNLOCK FOR B2B PRICING (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pricing B2B software products is challenging and often requires
iteration to get right. The emergence of AI agents has the potential
to fundamentally change how B2B software is priced, moving from
per-seat pricing to value-based pricing tied directly to the business
outcomes and revenue growth the AI enables. This shift will likely
start with smaller, more agile companies adopting AI-native technology
stacks before moving upmarket over time. 

 CLAY'S PATH TO PRODUCT-MARKET FIT ‚Äî A 7-YEAR 'OVERNIGHT SUCCESS'
(13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A founder's personality and psychology play a major role in a
startup's success, as their traits and decision-making are amplified
throughout the organization. Self-awareness is crucial for founders to
recognize how their own motivations and thought patterns impact the
company's direction. Committing to a specific ideal customer profile
and aligning the product and messaging accordingly, even if it feels
constraining at first, is often necessary to achieve true
product-market fit and rapid growth. 

 WEBTOON RISES MODESTLY IN IPO DEBUT (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Webtoon Entertainment's shares surged nearly 10% on their first
trading day after a successful IPO, raising $315 million and valuing
the company at approximately $2.67 billion. The platform, known for
its vertical scroll format, boasts 170 million monthly active users
globally. It has paid over $2.8 billion to creators since 2017.
Despite impressive revenue figures, the company reported a net loss of
$145 million in 2023.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW IMMI'S FOUNDERS BUILT A STRONG BRAND (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A startup called immi used creative marketing strategies to generate
leads and build a loyal community before launching its product. It
experimented with various organic and paid efforts, such as engaging
with potential customers on Reddit, creating authentic email flows,
and running a private Facebook group. By focusing on one marketing
channel at a time and constantly iterating, it was able to drive
significant revenue and organic traffic. 

 TWO WAYS TO VISUALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CHURN & EXPANSION (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Churn and retention are crucial metrics for business growth, but they
are often overlooked in favor of acquiring new customers. Paying
attention to churn can make a significant difference in a company's
revenue, especially for mature businesses where existing users
contribute a large portion of the overall revenue. By focusing on
reducing churn and expanding revenue from existing customers,
companies can achieve long-term, compounding growth. 

 WINNING SOFTWARE BUDGETS IN 2024 (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In 2024, software budgets are tighter as CFOs scrutinize spending
more closely, focusing on efficiency and optimization. Sales teams
need to understand how budgets are being created and work closely with
their internal champions to provide a thoughtful analysis of the value
and necessity of the software tools they are proposing to gain the
trust of the CFO and get purchases approved.

 INVESTING IN THE AGE OF GENERATIVE AI (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The current AI investment landscape is frothy and competitive, with
some early cracks emerging despite massive funding. Venture capital
firms face challenges in generating returns due to limited

vertical SaaS, taking on more technical risk, or backing companies in
smaller markets that can quickly reach profitability.

refining positioning to create targeted messaging for specific
audience segments, funnel stages, and channels. Focusing the core
positioning and homepage hero section on the primary audience, while
routing secondary audiences to dedicated content, is crucial for
delivering a clear and compelling message.
