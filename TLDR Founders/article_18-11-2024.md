 A FOUNDER'S PERSPECTIVE: 3 SIMPLE WAYS TO IMPROVE STARTUP HIRING ON
ASHBY'S PODCAST (SPONSOR) [4] 

 World-class talent is never easy to find, but old-fashioned
recruitment methods make it much harder and more time-intensive than
it needs to be.

In this podcast deep-dive [4], Co-Founder and VP of Engineering Abhik
Pramanik shares three strategies that transformed Ashby's hiring
culture to replace high-volume and time-intensive screening calls with
a self-selecting stream of value-aligned pros — saving hundreds of
hours in the process.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE EVOLUTION OF THE CREATOR (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The creator economy is evolving beyond traditional influencers to
encompass a broader range of creators focused on creativity and
self-expression. This shift is driven by advancements in creation
tools, distribution platforms, and monetization strategies. Companies
like Canva and CapCut are making content creation more accessible,
while platforms such as YouTube and TikTok dominate distribution. New
monetization models are emerging, including Flagship's affiliate
approach and AI-powered revenue streams like chatbot interactions. The
future of the creator economy looks promising, with potential for
significant companies to emerge by integrating creation, distribution,
and monetization into cohesive ecosystems. 

 THE UNHOLY TRINITY OF VENTURE CAPITAL (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Venture capital is undergoing a significant transformation driven by
three interconnected forces: massive investment firms raising billions
in capital, large institutional investors seeking stable returns, and
AI companies capable of absorbing unprecedented amounts of funding.
This evolving dynamic is reshaping how innovation gets funded, with
traditional venture capital firms facing pressure to adapt or risk
becoming obsolete in an industry increasingly dominated by mega-funds
and multi-billion dollar AI investments. 

 AI'S HOLY WAR OVER SCALING LAWS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The AI community is divided over whether scaling computation alone
will lead to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or if novel
scientific breakthroughs are required. Proponents of "scaling laws"
believe that increasing computational power will continue to drive AI
advancements, while skeptics argue that scaling is approaching its
limits and new approaches are necessary. This debate mirrors religious
schisms, with different factions advocating for distinct paths toward
AGI. The outcome could significantly impact the future direction of AI
research and industry.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HEY, GROWTH TEAMS: HERE'S HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH YOUR DESIGNERS (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The complex relationship between Growth and Design teams stems from
fundamentally different incentives and working styles. Growth teams
prioritize rapid experimentation and validation with a focus on
short-term metrics, while Design teams focus on delivering polished,
cohesive user experiences with long-term brand considerations. To
bridge this gap, Growth teams should involve designers in
experimentation reviews, allow time for design planning, and establish
shared metrics that balance business outcomes with user experience
quality. 

 GROWING REVENUE BY ALIGNING MARKETING AND SALES (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Achieving sustainable SaaS growth requires aligning sales and
marketing teams around shared revenue goals rather than treating them
as separate entities. Companies should assign responsibilities and
optimize collaboration across teams by breaking down the sales funnel
into new business, renewals, and expansions. This alignment fosters
predictable revenue generation by ensuring that both marketing and
sales contribute to pipeline development and work together to meet
revenue targets. 

 HALF OF YOUR “SUCCESSFUL” A/B TESTS ARE FALSE-POSITIVES (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The problem of false positives in scientific experiments and A/B
testing can lead to the approval of ineffective drugs and unreliable
scientific findings. Companies and researchers may manipulate results
by running multiple trials and only publishing favorable outcomes. To
avoid unintentional p-hacking in A/B tests, marketers should focus on
forming and testing theories rather than randomly experimenting,
emphasizing the importance of validated learning and seeking large,
impactful effects.

 MARKET TIPPING TO GROWTH (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Over the past two years, software companies have shifted their focus
from growth to profitability, driven by macroeconomic conditions.
However, recent trends suggest a renewed emphasis on growth,
particularly as companies invest in AI and other emerging
technologies. While profitability is still important, the market
appears to be rewarding growth more, signaling a potential shift back
towards expansion as companies prepare for a new growth cycle. 

 REFRESHING EQUITY GRANTS: RETAIN AND REWARD TOP TALENT (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 As companies approach the end of early employees' vesting schedules,
it's important to define a clear compensation philosophy and set a
strategy for equity grants. This includes determining when and why to
issue new hire, retention, promotion, and performance-based grants,
while ensuring continuous vesting through methods like boxcar grants
to avoid gaps in equity incentives. Regular reviews and data-driven
approaches help ensure that employees remain motivated and fairly
compensated. 

 BOARD MEETINGS THAT DON'T SUCK (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Effective board management is crucial for companies, especially
startups, to build trust and secure future funding. Regular,
transparent communication through investor updates, pre-meetings, and
well-prepared board meetings is essential. The focus should be on
strategic discussions rather than lengthy updates. Provide context and
control the conversation to maximize value from board interactions.
