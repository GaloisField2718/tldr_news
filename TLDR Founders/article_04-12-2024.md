HEADLINES & TRENDS

 BUILDING MOATS IN AI (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In this post, Carles Reina of ElevenLabs discusses the company's
strategic approach, emphasizing its dual focus on research and
application to create a competitive moat. He highlights the importance
of moving upmarket to cater to enterprise customers and the evolving
landscape where non-tech companies are increasingly adopting AI
solutions. Reina also underscores the significance of building a
strong community and ecosystem, leveraging both product-led and
sales-led growth strategies to ensure long-term success. 

 COOKING THE BOOKS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A recent incident at Macy's highlights concerns about trust and
internal controls after a single accountant manipulated accounting
entries to reduce expenses by $150 million over three years. This act
of financial statement fraud involved hiding expenses in the accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, significantly impacting reported net
income and key metrics for investors. The case underscores the
necessity of robust internal controls and vigilant oversight to
prevent such deceptive practices. 

 THE SURPRISING STATE OF SAAS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SaaS spending rebounded by 9% in 2024, with smaller companies (under
500 employees) leading a 59% increase, focusing on tech investments
for efficiency and employee satisfaction. The growth benchmark for
SaaS companies with over $50 million in ARR has shifted to a more
attainable 25% year-over-year rate. Vertical SaaS companies are
outperforming horizontal ones due to their industry-specific focus.
Pursuing larger deals, despite higher risks, can enhance growth and
retention.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NEXT-LEVEL PRODUCT PAGES (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI technology is revolutionizing e-commerce by simplifying the
creation of detailed, engaging product pages, which can significantly
enhance user experience and boost sales. Businesses can continuously
optimize their content to better meet customer needs while improving
SEO rankings by leveraging AI for tasks like A/B testing and
personalization. However, it's essential to balance AI-driven
experimentation with maintaining a consistent brand identity to ensure
a cohesive user experience. 

 5 STEPS TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR POV (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A clear point of view (POV) is crucial for B2B companies to
differentiate themselves, build trust, and drive growth. Establishing
a strong POV involves diagnosing current issues, framing the problem
from the customer's perspective, identifying challenges, stating a
purpose, illustrating success scenarios, and creating an inspiring
manifesto. Regular refinement of a company's POV is essential to
maintain relevance and impact in evolving markets. 

 DESIGN LITERACY IN THE AGE OF INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION (6 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 In a world increasingly dominated by AI and automation, design is
evolving from a specialized profession into a universal mindset that
combines strategic thinking with creative execution. This
transformation emphasizes the importance of human elements like
vision, curation, and conviction in creating meaningful products and
experiences. As AI democratizes creation and technical skills, success
will depend more on design literacy - the ability to understand what
to build and why it matters, rather than just how to build it.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 RESTRUCTURED: PULL ACTIONABLE DATA FROM DOCUMENTS, PRESENTATIONS,
VIDEO, AND AUDIO (SPONSOR) [10] 

 If you're building a data or AI product, you don't really want to
spend your time solving data extraction problems. Use Kolena's
Restructured to extract usable data points from vast volumes of
complex unstructured data [10]—PDFs, presentations, documents,
video, and audio—so you can focus on turning that data into value.

 FACEBOOK'S LITTLE RED BOOK (BOOK) [11]

company culture amid rapid growth by creating a "Little Red Book," a
manifesto encapsulating its core ethos. A high-quality digital scan of
this rare book has now been made publicly available.

 LESSONS FROM MY 3 MOST CHALLENGED INVESTMENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Early-stage investing is inherently risky. This post looks at three
portfolio companies that faced significant challenges despite strong
initial prospects and hardworking founders. It discusses the
importance of proper funding rounds, co-founder relationships, and
maintaining adequate cash reserves. Even promising startups with
strong growth can fail due to factors like market conditions, customer
churn, or internal conflicts. 

 WHY IS GOOGLE LOSING MARKET SHARE IN THE EU? (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google's search market share has been declining in several European
Union countries, particularly noticeable since 2018 and accelerating
after April 2024. This decline is primarily driven by privacy
regulations, choice screens for browsers and search engines on mobile
devices, and growing competition from alternatives like Bing and
privacy-focused search engines. While Google's revenue continues to
grow despite the market share losses, the trend signals a potential
shift toward a more fragmented search engine landscape, with Bing
emerging as the primary beneficiary of Google's declining dominance. 

 IT'S NOT WHAT I THOUGHT THAT MAKES A COMPANY GROW (6 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Startups achieve rapid growth through a combination of tools,
frameworks, and most importantly, a growth-oriented culture.
Successful startups have cultures that emphasize setting
(un)achievable goals, maintaining speed, using a common language
focused on key metrics, and prioritizing growth above all else, even
at the risk of burnout. However, such exponential growth is not
sustainable in the long term, and companies must eventually pivot
towards a more stable business model.

 THREE FUTURE STATES OF THE EARLY-STAGE VC ECOSYSTEM (2 MINUTE READ)
