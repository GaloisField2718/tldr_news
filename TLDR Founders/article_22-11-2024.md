HEADLINES & TRENDS

 DEFENSIBILITY: MULTI-WAVE MARKETS (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, companies face
the challenge of navigating markets with multiple waves of disruption
occurring in quick succession. This post presents two strategic
approaches for navigating these waves: the "AND" strategy of catching
consecutive waves by continuously adapting, and the "OR" strategy of
focusing on a single, final foreseeable wave. While execution power
(speed, taste, and rainmaking ability) transfers well between
technological waves, many structural advantages like patents or
specialized talent may not carry over to new tech stacks. The key to
success lies in carefully evaluating market conditions and choosing
between these strategies based on factors like wave viability, timing,
and transferrable advantages. 

 THE STATE OF GENAI IN THE ENTERPRISE (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Enterprise AI spending surged to $13.8 billion in 2024, marking a
dramatic 6x increase from 2023, as organizations shifted from
experimentation to implementing AI as a core business strategy. While
technical departments like IT and Engineering command nearly half of
AI investments, the technology is seeing adoption across all business
functions, with code copilots leading practical applications at a 51%
adoption rate and support chatbots following at 31%. The landscape
shows OpenAI's market share declining from 50% to 34% as Anthropic
doubles its presence to 24%, while RAG (retrieval-augmented
generation) has become the dominant architectural pattern with 51%
adoption. 

 THE NEW WORLD FOR ENTREPRENEURS & INVESTORS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The current technology super-cycle presents a significant opportunity
to modernize legacy industries by leveraging AI and other innovations
to automate repetitive tasks and address labor shortages. This shift
enhances efficiency and value creation, unlocking substantial
opportunities beyond traditional software. However, success in this
new era demands rethinking investment strategies, operating models,
and customer relationships, as traditional approaches may not align
with the evolving needs of these industries.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CHASING HEAT VS. BEING CONTRARIAN IN VENTURE CAPITAL (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Venture capital thrives on contrarian bets and the power law, where a
small number of investments drive the majority of returns. While
chasing trends often leads to overvalued opportunities, identifying
under-the-radar themes early can yield outsized outcomes. Promising
areas for future investment include healthcare, consumer applications
in AI, education innovation through personalization, and emerging
spaces like psychedelics, longevity, gaming, and generative AI-driven
digital media. These sectors are poised for growth as they align with
shifting market dynamics and technological advancements. 

 YOUR GUIDE TO THE 2024 SAAS BENCHMARKS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Growth rates among SaaS companies have stabilized in 2024, with
early-stage companies under $1M ARR showing remarkable performance,
achieving 250% top-quartile growth while maintaining lean teams of
just 7 people. The landscape shows a clear divide between AI-native
and vertical SaaS businesses performing well, while horizontal SaaS
applications face challenges, leading to new approaches in
monetization where 54% of AI products now use alternative pricing
models beyond traditional subscriptions. 

 THE AGE OF OUTCOME-BASED PRICING (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Outcome-based pricing represents a significant shift in the software
industry, moving away from traditional subscription or usage-based
models to charging customers based on measurable outcomes. This
approach aligns vendor revenue with customer success, reducing waste
and improving accountability. AI is playing a critical role in
enabling this model by automating processes and tracking performance
metrics, but clear definitions of success are essential to avoid
disputes and ensure a collaborative relationship between vendors and
customers.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE GREAT CREATIVE UNBUNDLING (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI is driving a major unbundling in creative work, empowering
independent creators with tools that rival the capabilities of large
organizations while simultaneously reducing the need for traditional
creative roles within those organizations. This shift rewards
versatile, multidisciplinary creators who can integrate AI across
domains and combine insights in innovative ways, blurring the lines
between individuals and institutions. As the creative landscape
evolves, success will hinge on leveraging AI to complement human
creativity and adapt to this new paradigm. 

 HIGH-BROW MEDIA FOR ALL (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Substack has evolved from a niche platform for intellectual
newsletters into a broader marketplace for creators, blending
traditional media with social media elements. It positions itself as a
cultural and intellectual hub, offering creators monetization
opportunities while fostering aspirational identities for readers.
However, its shift toward viral formats and multimedia risks diluting
its original high-brow appeal and raises questions about whether
intellectualism can scale without losing authenticity or quality. 

 THE RISE OF THE AI COMPANION (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Advancements in generative AI are transforming non-player characters
(NPCs) in games, enabling them to evolve from rigid, script-based
systems to more dynamic, interactive companions. Developers like
Inworld AI and nunu.ai are leveraging LLMs to create NPCs with
distinct personalities, autonomy, and the ability to surprise players
with unique behaviors. These innovations also extend to generalizable
AI agents capable of learning and adapting across various games,
opening new possibilities for both gaming and robotics.

QUICK LINKS

 THE "COMMON STARTUP FAILURE MODE" OF HIRING TOO MANY PEOPLE (2 MINUTE
READ) [16]

scaling issues without first understanding the company's dynamics. 

 STARTUP COMPENSATION IN THE UNITED STATES (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 While average salaries have remained relatively stable since November
2022, equity packages have seen a significant decline, dropping nearly
38%. 

 THOUGHTS ON BRIDGE ROUNDS (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Venture capitalists may be reluctant to invest in bridge rounds for
companies outside their portfolio due to a lack of insight into the
company's past milestones, reliance on potentially revised narratives,
and the binary nature of such funding situations.
