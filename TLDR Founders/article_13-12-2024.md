HEADLINES & TRENDS

 2025: REVENUE RETENTION OR BUST (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In 2025, cloud companies' survival will hinge on proving they have
customer churn under control. Investors are laser-focused on net and
gross revenue retention (NRR and GRR) as leading indicators of
efficient growth. Public companies' median NRR is 110%, with top
performers over 130%. Retention benchmarks vary by factors like ACV,
sales model, and company stage, so be wary of mismatched comparisons.
While strong NRR can mask churn problems, GRR is an important early
warning sign. The key is balancing both and plugging the "leaky
bucket" before growth stalls out. 

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES GEMINI 2.0: THE NEW AI MODEL FOR THE AGENTIC ERA (11
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Imagine having an AI assistant that not only understands you, but can
take action on your behalf. That's the promise of Google's new Gemini
2.0 model. It powers AI agents that could one day handle complex tasks
like planning a vacation or even writing software. However, as these
AI capabilities become more advanced, ensuring they are developed
responsibly becomes increasingly important. Google is prioritizing
safety measures as it explores applications in areas like gaming and
robotics. The pace at which we integrate these AI partners into our
daily lives will likely shape the trajectory of their impact. 

 TOPOLOGY LAUNCHES $75M FUND 1 (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Topology Ventures has raised $75M to back technical founders building
frontier technology like AI, decentralized protocols, and neurotech.
The company was founded by Casey Caruso, formerly at Google, Bessemer,
and Paradigm.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RETHINKING GOALS: THE SCIENCE OF NONLINEAR GOAL SETTING (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Traditional goal-setting can feel like a never-ending cycle of
chasing targets. However, Spotify's success story shows the power of
embracing detours. By staying open to unexpected opportunities, it
achieved milestones a rigid plan might have prevented. The key was
shifting from a perfectionist mindset to one of experimentation. Pay
attention to what truly interests you, run small tests, and build in
time for reflection. While you can't predict exactly where you'll end
up, this flexible approach often leads to more meaningful growth. 

 HOW TO BUILD A TRULY USEFUL AI PRODUCT (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Building AI startups requires adapting quickly to rapid advancements
in LLMs, avoiding problems that upcoming models will solve, and
leveraging high costs of cutting-edge technology for a competitive
edge. Focus narrowly on specific use cases to compete with
general-purpose AI, while emphasizing a seamless product experience.
Despite the fast-paced nature of generative AI, the core principles of
creating desirable products remain unchanged.

tasks and allows for sessions and reviews via Slack and VS Code
extensions.

 DEFENSIBILITY: APPLICATIONS (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI's disruption of software means today's "10x better" quickly
becomes tomorrow's table stakes. Startups will die more from
competition than starvation. AI reduces switching costs by automating
data/process migrations and can have strong or weak data network
effects - more data isn't always better. There are still big
opportunities for startups: $100T of global GDP is up for grabs
outside big tech's turf. Winners will sell AI-driven outcomes and
workflows, not just software. Though investments currently outpace
revenue, sufficiently-capable AI will transform every company and
industry. 

 FACEBOOK'S LACK OF STORYTELLING COST BILLIONS AND KILLED THE BRAND (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Facebook's mistake was letting others control its narrative as it
scaled. Early on, it thrived by focusing on tech and letting users and
journalists spread its story. However, over time, external forces
reshaped that story to Facebook's detriment. Lessons for founders:
your story needs to connect with customers to drive organic growth; if
you don't own your story, others will exploit it; and content must do
more than optimize funnels. New social networks are now intentionally
crafting their own narratives. Startups must prioritize authentic
storytelling to avoid Facebook's fate. 

 THE MEASUREMENT PARADOX: WHY SILICON VALLEY'S BEST COMPANIES ARE
DISCARDING THEIR METRICS (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Metrics meant to measure reality often distort it, creating dangerous
blind spots. Facebook's metrics masked its user exodus to TikTok.
Coinbase's stellar dashboards belied its eventual layoffs. The bigger
the eventual crash, the better things looked on paper. Now, elite
companies like Basecamp and Notion are thriving after ditching
analytics, A/B tests, and KPIs.
