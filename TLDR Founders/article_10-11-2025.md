 EVERY COMPANY WANT TO SELL INTO NEW MARKETS. FEW HAVE THE
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SCALE IT SUCCESSFULLY. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Insights from The Friction Report, a global research study, reveal
the key factors driving cross-border growth for SaaS leaders.

	* THEY LOCALIZE BY DESIGN.

Top performers are 2.5x more likely to localize every part of checkout
(currency, language, payment method options), which builds instant
buyer trust.

	* THEY INTEGRATE FOR EXPANSION.

Companies with connected CRM, billing, and ecommerce systems are 2x
more likely to enter new markets successfully.

	* THEY OFFLOAD COMPLEXITY ENTIRELY.

Leaders using a merchant of record (MoR) model are 30% more confident

growth — not payments, tax, and compliance.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE AI TALENT WAR: AI ACQUISITIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI companies are aggressively acquiring startups to secure top talent
and technology. Over $10 billion was spent on 365 M&A deals in early
2025. Major players like Google and Microsoft use acquihires to gain
specialized expertise and proprietary technology rapidly. This
strategy, driven by intense talent competition and regulatory
uncertainty, helps companies expedite AI development and maintain a
competitive edge. 

 SATYA NADELLA'S ANNUAL LETTER: THINKING IN DECADES, EXECUTING IN
QUARTERS (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Microsoft, 50 years since its founding, reported a record revenue
year led by significant AI transformation impacting all tech stack
layers. The company emphasizes AI-driven productivity in fields like
healthcare, banking, and retail, alongside major investments in cloud
infrastructure, security, and quantum computing. Key efforts include
launching 400+ AI-enabled datacenters, expanding AI Copilots with 100
million monthly active users, and committing $4 billion to AI
education initiatives, while aiming for sustainability with increased
renewable energy and water efficiency goals.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO HELP YOUR HEAD OF MARKETING WIN EARLY (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When a new Head of Marketing joins, everyone rushes in with ideas -
new deck, new brand, new campaign - and nothing tied to pipeline gets
finished. Slow the chaos early. Align on two or three measurable goals
for the first 90 days, make them public, and be explicit about what
marketing isn't touching yet. Then help them deliver something visible
that earns trust - refresh the homepage, fix demo follow-ups, or
launch one targeted campaign that actually brings in leads. 

 WHAT MAKES A ROUND EASY (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Every round falls into one of two buckets. Either you're an attention
spike - the kind of team, traction, or market that investors chase on
instinct - or you're an explainer, where belief builds through
conversation and time. This post breaks down how to tell which you are
and why it matters. 

 YOUR ROADMAP IS A PROTOTYPE FOR YOUR STRATEGY (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Product roadmaps should be treated as prototypes, focusing on
adaptability and learning, rather than rigid delivery contracts. A
flexible roadmap, like the Now-Next-Later model, encourages teams to
test assumptions, iterate based on feedback, and keep strategies
aligned with changing environments. By emphasizing the process over
the end product, roadmapping builds resilience and ensures strategies
remain relevant and effective.

 FOUNDER IDEOLOGY (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Every founder builds from a different place. Some are missionaries
who believe deeply in a mission, others are mercenaries who love the
chase. There are performers too - the rebels who bend the rules and
the ones who fake it until it breaks. People move between these types
as they grow, fail, or win. What matters most isn't which one you
start as, but who you're becoming while you build.
