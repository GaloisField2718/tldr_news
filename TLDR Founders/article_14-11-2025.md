 IF AI CAN'T FIND YOU, NEITHER CAN YOUR CUSTOMERS. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AirOps' $40M Series B [4] helps brands get found (and stay found) in
the AI era.

AI search is rewriting how customers discover brands, and the winners
are already pulling ahead. After closing our $40M Series B led by
Greylock, AirOps is scaling fast to help teams like Ramp, Wiz, Chime,
Webflow, and Klaviyo dominate AI search visibility. [4]

We're building tools & community that empower marketers to shape AI,
not just react to it, ensuring their brands are cited accurately and
chosen first.

Learn how leading teams win in AI search [4].

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN SAAS (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The new SaaS Benchmarks report shows something odd: for all the talk
about upheaval, most metrics barely moved. Early startups are
re-accelerating, margins are compressing from AI costs, and bigger
companies are quietly becoming profitable by hiring fewer people. Pair
CAC payback with NRR, and you get the only matrix that actually
predicts durable growth. 

 JEVONS OR BUST (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 a16z breaks down whether AI is headed for a shale-style boom-and-bust
or a Jevons-style surge where efficiency unlocks even more demand. AI
usage keeps climbing — Google is already at 1.3 quadrillion tokens a
month, a 50× jump in a year. Even as token prices fall, consumption
keeps exploding, with every plateau shattered by the next model
release. It looks far less like a capex bubble and far more like
Jevons in action: cheaper AI is driving more demand, not less.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 31 WAYS TO GROW YOUR STARTUP FAST IN 2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The fastest way for a software startup to grow is to pick the right
growth levers for its current stage. This post provides 33 proven
tactics for scaling. The tactics are sorted by revenue stage and
owner, with each linking to a full playbook. What works at $300K ARR
won't work at $3M. 

 WHY EVERY AI CODING TOOL GETS PRICING WRONG (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 How you price an AI IDE will depend on which subset of the market you
are going after, what your long-term strategy is, and how you
differentiate. Engineers will have large usage fluctuations, so
startups need to price accordingly to insulate against that. The
typical way of doing this is to charge users a subscription fee and
bill usage on top of that. Companies are now making price changes
several times a year just to keep up with shifting costs and adoption.


 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO AI PROTOTYPING TOOLS (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI prototypes can turn speculation and pontification into evidence
fast. It's as simple as building four versions of a flow in Bolt or
Replit, pulling your real design system into Reforge Build, dogfooding
it the same afternoon, and seeing where people actually hesitate or
click through. The code is disposable, so there's no pretending it
speeds up shipping. This technique exposes which ideas survive contact
with reality. 

 THE OTHER PMF (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most founders think communication is a charisma problem when it's
actually a fit problem. This piece breaks down personality message
fit, a second kind of PMF where you stop mimicking “leader voice”
and build around how you naturally think, talk, and react. It shows
how to audit your baseline, prep with 30-second micro-clarity, read
implicit feedback, sharpen your spikes, and tweak delivery like an
experiment. Communication becomes a system you design, not a
performance you fake.

 WHEN CUSTOMER OBSESSION BACKFIRES: THE NETFLIX VS. BLACKBERRY LESSON
(7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sometimes being customer-obsessed can work against you. BlackBerry
listened to feedback about wanting better keyboards and perfected
them, yet completely ignored the shift toward touchscreens that the
iPhone represented. History shows it failed spectacularly. The
difference comes down to the Einstellung effect, where expertise
creates blindness to better solutions. Founders need to distinguish
temporary customer truths like physical keyboards from permanent human
needs like efficient communication. This article offers frameworks,
including physics-first analysis and monthly anti-expertise audits,
where you argue against your strongest beliefs. 

 LENSES: WHY ONE VIEW IS NEVER ENOUGH IN PRODUCT WORK (5 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Product work requires juggling multiple perspectives at once. Anyone
who's opened a Miro board knows this truth. People create beautifully
messy diagrams with overlapping lenses because one view is never
enough to capture reality. This article breaks down nine different
lenses teams use simultaneously: customer journey flows, persona
mapping, Wardley Map axes showing capability evolution and user
proximity, team boundaries and interactions, opportunities and
options, and execution workflows.

 A GOOD BUSINESS VS A USEFUL IDEA (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A “good idea” is something useful or clever, but it only becomes
a business when you turn it into something people can't easily
substitute and will actually pay a premium for.
