HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHAT'S WORKING NOW IN GTM AI: HOW RALLY REIMAGINED WIN ANALYSIS WITH
AI (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Win-loss analysis is high leverage but notoriously hard to do well.
Buyers don't tell you the full truth, sellers have blind spots, and
scheduling interviews takes forever. AI can reconstruct win-loss
insights from sales call recordings alone. Feed your Gong transcripts
into a custom GPT, and it will surface patterns across dozens of deals
faster than any manual process. 

 WHAT'S WORKING IN SAAS PRICING RIGHT NOW (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Credit-based pricing exploded 126% in 2025 because it splits the
difference between predictable licenses and pure usage. Customers can
budget, while vendors protect margins on volatile AI costs. Meanwhile,
per-seat pricing isn't dying like everyone predicted. It's evolving.
OpenAI and Figma now tie seats to capability tiers and product access.
Salesforce lets customers swap unused licenses for AI credits. Nobody
knows what AI is actually worth yet, so the winners are offering
multiple ways to pay.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 STOP HIRING FOR EXPERTISE: HOW TO RECRUIT A-PLAYERS (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A polished resume from Google often can't ship anything at your
startup. That's because you hired an expert, not a builder. The hiring
framework that actually works: evaluate drive first, then potential,
then expertise. Drive is the internal engine you can't coach or
install. Potential is how fast someone climbs. Expertise only matters
after the first two spike. To test for drive, don't even look at the
résumé before the interview: ask what they've obsessed over, when
the hardest they've ever worked was, and why. If someone has never
been deeply consumed by anything, they won't suddenly become consumed
by your company. 

 LOCAL ≠ SMALL BRAND IMPACT (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Founders never ask how to build a local press strategy, and that's a
mistake. If you're trying to reach small business owners, educators,
or non-technical professionals, the Boston Globe might outperform
TechCrunch. Local publications punch above their weight on Facebook,
where community stories spread fast through geographic networks. The
playbook is simple. Find customers in target cities, hear their
stories, then pitch their story to local reporters. You get awareness,
they get visibility. Local journalists don't need proof that your
company matters to the world. They need proof it matters to their
city.

MISCELLANEOUS

 25 THINGS I BELIEVE IN TO BUILD GREAT PRODUCTS (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Speed is the only moat, and focus is a superpower. Build fast
feedback loops, and say no 10 times more than you say yes. The product
is more important than the process, so build minimum viable plans,
practice prototype-first development, obsess about the details, and
simplify product reviews. Seek the truth and be willing to be wrong.
Hire builders, not bureaucrats aiming to climb the career ladder. 

 THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The skill that will remain relevant for decades is agency: the
ability to act, iterate, and adapt without permission. High-agency
individuals treat life as an experiment, use AI and tools as
amplifiers rather than crutches, and build generalist capabilities to
thrive across changing industries. Developing agency requires setting
goals, experimenting, analyzing results, and creating your own
processes, enabling long-term adaptability, skill acquisition, and
control over your future. 

 WHY AI STARTUPS MUST RELEARN GROWTH EVERY QUARTER (1 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Product-market fit resets every three months at Lovable because AI
capabilities and user expectations shift too fast to rely on long-term
scaling, even past $200M ARR. Roughly 95% of growth comes from
shipping new features, while funnel optimization contributes only
about 5%, forcing teams to prioritize velocity over polish.
Influencer-driven demos, free credits, and large communities now
outperform paid ads, making word of mouth the primary growth engine.
