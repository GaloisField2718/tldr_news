 THE MONETIZATION OPERATING MODEL: HOW TO THINK ABOUT PRICING,
BILLING, AND GROWTH IN THE AI ERA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Many startups are struggling to find a sustainable pricing model for
AI-powered software. Most are either scaring away customers with
enterprise contracts, or selling at a loss and praying for cheaper
models.

Metronome's new and highly anticipated whitepaper [4] offers a
practical framework for navigating these shifting waters. It's based
on Metronome's work with market leaders including OpenAI, Databricks,
and NVIDIA, and tackles questions such as:

 	* The monetization complexity of PLG + SLG
 	* Metering tokens and agent invocations
 	* Transitioning to results-based pricing
 	* Enabling safe and flexible pricing experimentation

This operating model [4] is a must-read for any founder grappling
with pricing in 2025. Grab your free copy [4]

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 AI'S LABOR IMPACT, AND HOW TO NOT LOSE OUR MINDS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Stanford researchers analyzed payroll data from 25 million American
workers and found AI is already replacing early-career workers in
specific fields. Software developers aged 22-25 have seen 6% job
losses since ChatGPT launched, while developers over 30 gained 9% more
jobs in the same period. Customer service shows the same pattern -
young workers losing jobs, older workers gaining them. The data
suggests AI isn't coming for all jobs or even most jobs, but it's
systematically eliminating the entry-level positions in fields where
experience matters less and tasks can be automated. 

 KLARNA TO SEEK VALUATION OF UP TO $14 BILLION IN IPO NEXT MONTH (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Klarna plans to go public in the U.S. next month, seeking a valuation
of $13-$14 billion after pausing its IPO in April. The fintech company
aims to raise nearly $1 billion, with shares priced at $34-$36. This
reflects a significant drop from its 2021 valuation target of $50
billion. 

 XAI HAS OPEN-SOURCED GROK 2.5 (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 xAI open-sourced the model weights for Grok 2.5, its leading model
from last year, on Hugging Face. Elon Musk noted that Grok 3 is
expected to be open-sourced in about six months.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE FOUNDER'S GUIDE TO EFFECTIVE SOCIAL MEDIA USE (4 MINUTE READ) [8]


 An investor says he won't take meetings from founders who don't post
on X because he needs to see how they think before deciding if they're
worth his time. Without warm referrals, investors have no way to
verify you're legitimate, so they check your social presence to see
how you think and whether you're making progress. The strategy is to
post 5-10 times daily about non-obvious insights, commenting early on
industry posts to get noticed, and relaunching your product
announcement every two weeks. The point isn't to go viral, but to
build a consistent record showing you can ship and think clearly over
time. 

 PREVENTING CHURN (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many tech companies enforce long-term contracts to mask churn by
preventing dissatisfied customers from leaving. This tactic hides
dissatisfaction rather than addressing root problems, leading to
customer resentment and lost future revenue. Instead, companies should
prioritize customer satisfaction and renewals through excellent
product and service, fostering loyalty without forced commitments. 

 5 INTERESTING LEARNINGS FROM GOOGLE CLOUD AT $54 BILLION IN ARR (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google Cloud's ARR reached $54 billion, with a 31.7% growth driven by
AI advancements. Key drivers include increased infrastructure demand,
new revenue from Gemini AI models, and competitive AI-native
positioning. Google also reported 38% backlog growth, a 35x increase
in Gemini customer adoption, and larger deal sizes, indicating robust
enterprise adoption and confidence in sustained growth.

 RILLET RAISES $70M SERIES B FROM ANDREESSEN HOROWITZ AND ICONIQ (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Rillet raised $70M in a Series B funding round led by Andreessen
Horowitz and ICONIQ, bringing its total funding to over $100M in less
than a year. The AI-native ERP platform, designed for modern finance
teams, is rapidly growing with over 200 customers, including strategic
partnerships with top accounting firms. Rillet aims to redefine
enterprise accounting by offering faster insights, leaner teams, and
improved decision-making through native integrations and AI-powered
financial systems. 

 ZERO-WASTE GTM (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Public SaaS companies are spending between $2 and $8 to acquire $1 of
revenue. Most of this money goes to the same place: trying to get
leads into the top of the funnel. Monday.com learned this lesson
painfully when its stock dropped 30% in a single day after admitting
organic search had dried up. Without a cheap pipeline, you grow slower
or pay more. Now, everyone's betting AI will save them, but AI SDRs
are producing the same mediocre results as human SDRs, only faster and
in greater volume. The math suggests something different: use AI to
cut your sales team in half while keeping revenue flat, then pour
those savings into finding new customers. 

 TO LEARN A NEW MARKET, START BY BUILDING YOUR PRODUCT (5 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Othman Laraki left Twitter to build a $250 genetic test because the
one that could have saved his grandmother cost $4,000. He knew nothing
about healthcare but figured the technology was simple enough. After
two years of talking to doctors and insurance companies, he learned
that healthcare doesn't work like normal markets - even if you make
something 90% cheaper, insurance companies can't buy more of it from
just you because doctors want tests from specific labs, so they
restrict the whole category instead. The cheap test was the wrong
product anyway. Big employers who actually pay for healthcare don't
want to buy individual tests, they want to cut their cancer costs by
millions. So Laraki built a virtual cancer clinic instead, which is
now worth a billion dollars. Most technical people think everyone
before them was incompetent, but usually those people were just
responding to incentives you don't understand yet.
