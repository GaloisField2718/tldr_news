 TLDR FOUNDERS 2025-09-08

 THIS AI RECRUITER MATCHED 1,000+ COMPANIES WITH TOP ENGINEERING
TALENT. COST: $0 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Remember when recruiting meant paying 20% to headhunters, and still
having to do most of the work yourself? Those days are over.

Lia is an AI agent who headhunts engineers 24/7 [4] for companies like
Vercel, Ramp, and Zapier.

Candidates pay a success fee 20% of their first _month_ (not year!),
if hired. Companies pay nothing 🤯

→ FOUNDERS: Tell Lia your open roles. She'll find the best engineers
and intro you directly. Click YES or NO on matches to help Lia learn.
Start hiring [5]

→ ENGINEERS: Get warm intros to decision makers - without spamming
CVs and getting ghosted. No hire = no fee. Get hired [6]

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 SAFES ARE BLOWING UP CAP TABLES (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Simple Agreement for Future Equity was supposed to simplify
fundraising by delaying valuation discussions, but founders are
stacking multiple SAFEs at different caps and losing track of dilution
- Carta data shows they typically own less than 40% of their company
before Series B after giving away 10% on pre-seed SAFEs, 20% at seed,
20% at Series A, plus 12-13% for employee options. 

 YOU.COM RAISES $100M SERIES C AT A $1.5 BILLION VALUATION TO BUILD
THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE AGENTIC ERA (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 You.com raised $100 million in Series C funding, reaching a $1.5
billion valuation, to enhance AI infrastructure for the Agentic Era.
The platform integrates various data sources, providing accurate
results for AI agents by combining private data with live web data. It
processes over a billion queries monthly and outperforms competitors
like Bing and Google in speed and accuracy, offering API solutions for
developers and tailored AI applications for enterprises. 

 EXA RAISES $85M SERIES B TO POWER AI-OPTIMIZED SEARCH (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Exa raised $85m in a Series B led by Benchmark, with Peter Fenton
joining the board, aiming to optimize web search for AI applications.
Their search engine offers high-quality, ad-free results and features
full content access, fast performance, high compute options,
customization, and zero data retention. Plans include expanding their
GPU cluster and team to continue advancing web search capabilities
beyond traditional engines.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR TARGET MARKET ISN'T DEMOGRAPHIC (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 It's tempting to define your market as "small businesses in the UK"
or "females 19-29," but that misses who actually buys - individual
teams at Google purchase the same $50/month tools designed for solo
founders, swiping credit cards like any small business would. The
author discovered this at WP Engine when Fortune 500 companies started
buying their WordPress hosting built for small businesses. A bank used
it for branch websites, a fast-food chain for local social content.
The common thread wasn't company size but specific needs. The real
market dimensions are urgency of problem, tolerance for new vendors,
whether they buy individually or in a committee, and how they measure
success. Stop asking "what size company buys this?" and start asking
"who recognizes themselves in our customer stories?" That recognition,
not firmographics, defines your market. 

 BUILD A COLD EMAIL SCORECARD IN LESS THAN 15 MINUTES WITH CHATGPT (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A BDR manager with 8 reps and no budget asked how to improve email
quality without spending all day coaching. The answer was surprisingly
simple - make your SDRs self-assess before hitting send using a
scorecard you build with ChatGPT in 15 minutes. The key is to craft a
prompt with seven components: objective (create a scorecard), persona
(act as a sales manager), context (your ICP details), instructions (4
categories with 3-4 criteria each), constraints (under 500 words),
tone (conversational), and response format (markdown with checkboxes).
The output gives you a scoring system, and your reps develop better
instincts, you spend less time editing, and reply rates go up because
they're catching their own mistakes before you have to. 

 HOW MUCH DO YOU REALLY NEED AFTER YOU EXIT? (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Exit Yield Calculator, based on Yale's research, estimates annual
income from a lump sum post-business sale without depleting the
principal. It considers taxes, one-off expenses, and a conservative
investment strategy with versions available in USD, GBP, and EUR.
Aiming for a $25 million exit figure often provides financial freedom,
but planning for post-exit life challenges is equally vital.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STUFF COSTS MONEY (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Open source software companies keep learning the same lesson. You
start by building open source tools for the community, putting
everything on GitHub, and promising it'll stay free. You build in
public, create Discord channels, and respond to every issue. Then the
bills come due - servers, salaries, and the basic costs of existing as
a company. So you launch a paid tier, swearing it's just for a tiny
fraction of users. Your community gets angry. The whole industry acts
surprised when free software eventually costs money, even though
software is expensive to build and maintain. Nobody expects free movie
tickets just because trailers are free, but somehow charging for
software after giving away the core version makes you a sellout. 

 HOW TO TELL GOOD ADVICE FROM BAD ONES (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The universe operates on simple laws, and so does advice. First Law:
Good advice is simple. We complicate basic truths to feel superior,
yet "show up consistently" remains true whether you accept it or not.
Second Law: Good advice is boring. Bad advice promises overnight
transformation. Good advice says show up at the dojo every Thursday
for years until one day you're doing handstand pushups without
thinking. Third Law: Good advice is constructive. It points toward
futures worth creating instead of listing what to avoid. These laws
work like gravity - they don't care if you find them pedestrian. 

 VENTURE-BACKED IPOS OF 2025 HAVE DONE WELL POST-DEBUT; NOW IT'S
FIGMA'S TURN (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Venture-backed IPOs in 2025 have performed well, with all of the
largest offerings trading above their initial prices. Figma is
expected to benefit from this positive trend, pricing its IPO at $33
per share. Circle is the standout performer, with shares up over 5x
since its IPO, sparking interest in public offerings from other crypto
and tech companies.
