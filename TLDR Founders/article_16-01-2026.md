 VIBE CODING IS OVER. GEN Z FOUNDERS ARE VIBING ENTIRE BUSINESSES
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 What's changing is how new startups get built.

Instead of limiting agents to writing code, new founders are deploying
multi-agent systems that handle research, product, engineering, and
user acquisition together. [4] Ideas get validated, products ship, and
customers get acquired in minutes, without requiring deep domain
expertise.

The shift is simple. You no longer scale by hiring more people. You
scale by making better decisions and letting software handle
execution.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 ANTHROPIC AND OPENAI ARE DOUBLING DOWN ON HEALTH (10 MINUTE READ) [5]


 OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health to connect consumers with their
medical records and apps, and introduced enterprise products for
hospitals, while Anthropic revealed Claude for Healthcare to support
research and industry data integration. These moves elevate the health
tech bar, posing opportunities and challenges for startups, especially
those in wellness and data integration. Increased competition and
potential M&A activity are on the horizon, as startups navigate
partnerships and product development with major AI players. 

 SOFTWARE'S YOUTUBE MOMENT IS HAPPENING NOW (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 YouTube launching in 2005 didn't seem to fill an obvious content gap.
Two decades later, it's a $550bn business more culturally relevant
than traditional TV. The same long-tail creation wave is happening for
software right now. Before LLMs, most apps never got built because the
barriers were too high. Now the time from idea to working app has
compressed from weeks to hours. The addressable market for builders
just expanded dramatically. You don't need to be "interested in
software" to build software. You just need to be interested in good
ideas.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE ONLY MARKETING PLAYBOOK YOU NEED TO HIT $10K MRR (7 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Reddit posts drive rapid MRR growth when founders build credibility
first, share stories, and bury links, generating thousands in revenue
from a single post. TikTok and Instagram slideshows copied from
high-performing content, enhanced with AI-generated images and concise
text, can hit millions of views in days without hard selling. Targeted
DMs in Discord, Slack, and Reddit convert 10–25% of prospects by
providing tactical help first, while competitor-alternative posts and
optimized onboarding turn traffic into paying customers. 

 WHAT WE LEARNT FROM SPEEDRUNNING THE IDEA MAZE (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The "Speedrunning the Idea Maze" course revealed that introducing key
concepts like Effectuation earlier enhances students' ability to
compare entrepreneurial cases effectively. The course also found that
shifting to video-based content improved engagement, prompting plans
for more asynchronous formats like podcasts. Effectuation, a strategy
integrating affordable loss bets and stakeholder partnerships,
reframes entrepreneurship as less risky and emphasizes cognitive
transformation over traditional learning methods to enhance real-world
application. 

 HOW TO SHOW UP IN ANY ROOM WITH A LOW HEART RATE: SILICON VALLEY'S
MISSING ETIQUETTE PLAYBOOK (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Sam Lessin, a partner at Slow Ventures and former Facebook VP of
Product, emphasizes the importance of etiquette for Silicon Valley
founders to build trust as technology becomes more central. He offers
an etiquette book and courses to help founders manage social
interactions and maintain composure in any setting. The content covers
techniques for introductions, small talk, meetings, and resolving
awkward social situations.

 DEAD COMPANIES WALKING (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Scott Fearon's "Dead Companies Walking" outlines six common mistakes
leading to company failures: relying solely on past strategies,
sticking to one success formula, misreading customer needs, succumbing
to hype, failing to adapt, and being detached from operations. The
rapid transition from SaaS to AI intensifies these issues, as
businesses struggle with outdated sales strategies, unmet AI demand,
overhyped products, and leadership disconnected from fast-paced
technological changes. Understanding these pitfalls is crucial in the
current AI-driven market landscape. 

 HOW I ACTUALLY GET GOOD ADVICE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Most founders take advice wrong. They ask for solutions when they
should be asking for diagnoses. The person giving you advice will
probably be right 50% of the time on solutions, but they'll nail the
actual problem because problems don't vary as much as solutions do.
Pick a topic where you have ideas but not conviction, find 4 people
who've done it, and cold message them with a specific question. Before
every call, write a one-pager summarizing where you are and what you
want to ask. This is the single most important thing. 

 THE NEXT MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The cost of doing is approaching zero. The benefit of deciding is
higher than ever. We are the bottleneck now. AI is too fast, too good
at building. The skill that matters is shifting from execution to
orchestration. Founders don't need to be operators anymore. They need
to be systems architects.
