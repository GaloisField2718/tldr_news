HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SAAS COMPANIES STAY PRIVATE FOR LONGER (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Despite the recent IPOs of Klaviyo, Rubrik, and the anticipated debut
of OneStream, the SaaS industry is experiencing a trend of companies
staying private for longer periods, with the median age at IPO now
around 11 years. This shift has significant implications for various
stakeholders, including employees, venture capitalists, and public
market investors, as it affects liquidity, investment strategies, and
potential value creation post-IPO. 

 CULTIVATING CULTS (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Every company, movement, and individual represents a story that can
attract devoted followers and form a "cult" around it. Building an
effective cult requires having the courage to stand out, articulating
a compelling "why", attracting dedicated early followers, and
fostering a sense of belonging and shared purpose. While the word
"cult" often has negative connotations, understanding the elements
that allow some groups to generate cult-like passion and loyalty can
provide valuable insights into effective storytelling, leadership, and
community building.

the 2024 presidential election following President Joe Biden's
decision to drop out of the race. Harris, who has roots in the Bay
Area and a long relationship with the tech industry, has expressed
support for regulating AI and addressing concerns around TikTok's
ownership. Some venture capitalists worry about potential
overregulation under her administration.

MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In the first 90 days, a new VP of Sales should focus on identifying
quick wins, conducting a comprehensive data analysis, and developing a

 WHY IS MANAGEMENT SO MALE? (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A study of a large European manufacturer reveals that junior men are
more likely to apply for promotions than women, primarily due to a
greater desire for team leadership. This "broken rung" in early career
progression could explain persistent male dominance in upper
management, even in the absence of overt discrimination. The study
highlights the need for organizations to address gender differences in
leadership aspirations and perceptions to create more balanced
leadership pipelines. 

 CODIFYING LIQUID DEATH'S DISRUPTION (13 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Liquid Death triumphed in a saturated market by exploiting the 'mere
exposure effect' and crafting a polarizing brand that customers
identify with, eschewing the norm for disruptive, entertaining
marketing. CEO Mike Cessario's formula for success‚Äînovelty,
irreverence, sustainability, and a knack for engaging
content‚Äîcatapulted the brand to a $1.4 billion valuation, showing
how risk-taking and authentic branding can outmaneuver a hefty
advertising budget. 

 5 UNEXPECTED LESSONS FROM PIXAR AND DISNEY (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Co-founder of Pixar Animation Ed Catmull's book, "Creativity Inc.",
reveals striking parallels between Pixar's filmmaking and traditional
software development. The book argues for embracing iterative changes,
avoiding perfectionism on non-essential details, conducting immersive
user research, and resisting the urge to constantly produce. These
insights offer a fresh perspective on creating innovative,
user-centric products in tech, emphasizing quality and meaningful
output over rigid processes and constant feature development.

 WHY ARE VCS SO ADAMANT ABOUT WARM INTROS? (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Warm introductions to investors are often a waste of time unless they
are "double qualified" - meaning the person making the intro provides
a strong, specific endorsement of the founder and startup. 

 WHY FOUNDERS SHOULD HIRE A CHIEF OF STAFF (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Hiring a Chief of Staff can be a game-changer for founders as they
handle high-leverage, cross-functional projects and act as a force
multiplier. 

 WHEN TO NOT FOCUS ON PERFORMANCE MARKETING (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Uber's data science team turned off Meta ads for three months in

advertising spend.
