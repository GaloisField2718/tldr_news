HEADLINES & TRENDS

 OPENAI ENTERS THE BROWSER WARS WITH CHATGPT AGENT (4 MINUTE READ) [5]


 OpenAI combined deep research and Operator into ChatGPT Agent - it
thinks like one and acts like the other. It was tested on 1,300
support emails, and in 15 minutes, it found customer complaints,
searched LinkedIn for happy users, and built customer archetypes. The
browser wars are heating up - Dia and Comet are building AI into
browsers while OpenAI wants to skip browsers entirely. Whoever wins
gets to stand between users and the entire web. 

 A-PLAYERS GET $100M COMP? (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google paid $2.4B to Windsurf just to get its AI talent fast. Meta is
poaching AI researchers for NBA superstar money. The race shows how
much A-players matter at every level. Netflix treats companies like
sports teams, not families, ruthlessly keeping the best talent. Real
performers are the "drivers," while everyone else is just a passenger
along for the ride. One hiring rule stands out: pick the motivated
hard worker over the brilliant slacker every time. 

 REFLECTION AI LAUNCHES ASIMOV CODE RESEARCH AGENT (2 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Reflection AI, founded by former OpenAI and DeepMind researchers who
raised $130M in March, has released Asimov, a code research agent that
indexes entire codebases and team knowledge to answer engineering
questions with citations.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LLM SEO: THE BIGGEST ORGANIC MARKETING ARBITRAGE SINCE GOOGLE IN 2003
(6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Founders are starting to treat LLMs like new distribution rails, not
just search engines. Instead of competing for top spots on Google,
they're optimizing to appear directly in answers from ChatGPT, Claude,
and Perplexity. These models reward schema, clarity, citations, and
presence across trusted sources, not just backlinks and keywords. When
done right, it's like owning a seat in the AI's memory. LLM SEO isn't
just a trend, it's an overlooked edge with compounding returns. 

 LETTERS TO A YOUNG FOUNDER (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Mercury CEO Immad Akhund focused on scaling while maintaining high
product quality by enhancing risk and compliance teams and launching
new financial tools like invoicing and spend management. They created
small, independent product teams to innovate while keeping core
products strong, exemplified by the successful launch of Mercury
Personal for consumer accounts. Akhund emphasized hiring passionate
talent, managing "product debt" effectively, and leveraging existing
customer behavior to expand services. 

 KEYWORD RESEARCH MIGHT BIAS YOUR SEO (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Keyword research is like writing bad survey questions - it assumes
what people want before asking. A pizza shop targeting "Domino's"
keywords gets clicks from people who specifically want Domino's, not
any pizza. This seems obvious once pointed out, but most SEO starts
with chasing high-volume keywords anyway. The author's client proved
this wrong. Instead of writing another generic "best parenting tips"
article (huge search volume), they wrote about the psychological cost
of giving screens to toddlers. Zero people searched for that exact
phrase, but parents loved it so much that it created its own search
demand.

 THE BIRTH OF DELPHI INTELLIGENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Delphi Digital has launched Delphi Intelligence, a dedicated research
platform focused on AI, robotics, and emerging tech. Backed by its
experience in crypto, it has already invested in 20+ AI x crypto
startups, incubated projects through AI-focused accelerators, and
built a growing research team. The platform offers in-depth, public
reports on key AI developments, with the aim of becoming a leading hub
for high-signal analysis in the space. 

 INSIDE THE SAAS EFFICIENCY GAP (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sub-$1M ARR startups went from 13 people in 2022 to just 7 today,
while companies over $50M ARR saw efficiency drop 34%. Public SaaS now
takes 57 months to recover sales costs - nearly five years.
Early-stage teams figured out what big companies missed by hiring
former founders who do everything. One person runs content and paid
ads, GTM hires code like engineers, and each employee manages AI
agents instead of people. Big companies keep adding specialists and
management layers while startups just give everyone AI and let them
run wild. 

 HIDDEN TECHNICAL DEBT IN AI (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Everyone thought AI would simplify software - turns out we were
wrong. Google's 2015 paper showed machine learning was just a tiny
black box surrounded by massive infrastructure. AI was supposed to fix
this - drop in an LLM and watch it work. Makes you wonder - are we
making progress or just shifting complexity around?
