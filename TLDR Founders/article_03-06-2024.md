HEADLINES & TRENDS

 RIP SOFTWARE - THE WORST SENTIMENT EVER (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Investor sentiment towards software companies has reached an all-time
low, with many big cloud names experiencing massive stock price
crashes following their earnings reports. The fear is that generative
AI may disrupt the software model by reducing the cost of software
generation to nearly zero, potentially eroding the premium charged by
these companies over time. While software companies are investing
heavily in AI, the payoff remains uncertain, and the durability and
profitability of AI-generated revenue compared to traditional software
revenue are still in question. 

 WILL THIS BE PERPLEXITY AI'S MOAT? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The AI industry is rapidly evolving and various companies are
competing for user loyalty through differentiated offerings.
Perplexity AI has launched a new feature called Pages that enables
users to collaborate with AI to create rich content from scratch.
While the tool is easy to use and can quickly generate pages with
source links, it has limitations such as hallucinations, unreliable
sources, and difficulty in manual editing. The success of Perplexity
Pages will depend on its dataset, which cannot be easily replicated by
competitors, and whether it can create a unique user experience. 

 TRUMP CALLS IT AN 'HONOR' TO JOIN TIKTOK (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Donald Trump, who previously sought to ban TikTok due to national
security concerns, has now joined the popular video-streaming app.
Despite still considering TikTok a threat, Trump believes banning it
would only benefit Facebook, which he considers an "enemy of the
people." The former president's presence on TikTok could be an
important avenue for reaching younger voters ahead of the election, as
nearly a third of Americans under 30 get their news from the app.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE MVP DEATH SPIRAL (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Focusing on building a minimum viable product (MVP) with a predefined
set of features often leads teams into a vicious cycle of constantly
reprioritizing and adding new features in a desperate attempt to
achieve product-market fit. This "MVP Death Spiral" stems from
treating features as real, tangible things that can be controlled,
rather than focusing on the messy, unpredictable behaviors of
customers. To escape this spiral, teams should shift their perspective
from a supply-side tactic of picking the right features to a
demand-side strategy of enabling the right customer behaviors that
make them awesome. 

 HOW TO GET TO $10M ARR (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Scaling a startup from $1M to $10M ARR requires evolving from a
founder to a founder-CEO. This involves establishing a structured
hiring process, delegating to the team while staying hands-on, and
defining a culture built to scale. It also necessitates constructing a
well-oiled go-to-market machine by fueling demand generation, turning
sales into a data-driven process, maturing the product offering, and
obsessing over delivering measurable customer outcomes. The key is to
start building these capabilities early by diving in, experimenting,
and learning by doing. 

 2024 SAAS CUSTOMER ACQUISITION BENCHMARKS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The latest Benchmarkit report for 2024 reveals that the median CAC
Ratio for acquiring new customers has remained stable compared to the
previous year, despite the broader market not cutting back on sales
and marketing expenses. However, the report also shows a significant
45% year-over-year increase in the Customer Expansion CAC Ratio,
indicating that obtaining more revenue from existing customers has
become more challenging and expensive.

 COLLABORATION WILL STRENGTHEN THE SUPPLY CHAIN (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The supply chain industry has faced significant challenges in recent
years, with disruptions and stalled growth leading to the downfall of
both startups and long-standing incumbents. However, a new focus on
collaboration, driven by advanced technology and generative AI, is set
to revolutionize the industry and drive the next wave of growth.
Innovative companies across manufacturing, distribution, shipping,
logistics, and retail are leveraging AI and shared data to optimize
workflows, break down silos, and capture efficiencies, paving the way
for a more collaborative and prosperous future in the supply chain
sector. 

 THE TWO FOUNDATIONAL MODELS TO FIND PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 This article presents two foundational models for understanding and
achieving product-market fit. The first model, "Case Study
Replication," emphasizes the importance of focusing on a single
customer's journey and replicating that successful case study where
the customer actively seeks out the product. The second model,
"Unfolding," describes the iterative process of refining the case
study through selling and serving customers, making necessary
adjustments to create a coherent and effective approach to
product-market fit. 

 OUR THESIS ON AI VOICE AGENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Artificial intelligence is poised to revolutionize phone calls,
enabling voice agents to handle interactions for both businesses and
consumers. For companies, this means cost savings, increased
efficiency, and improved customer experiences, while consumers gain
access to affordable AI-powered services like therapy and coaching.
The most exciting opportunities lie in developing vertical-specific
B2B voice agents and creating novel B2C voice experiences that go
beyond simply replacing human-to-human conversations.
