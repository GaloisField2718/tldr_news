HEADLINES & TRENDS

 PE IS NO LONGER COMING TO THE RESCUE (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 $587B in tech M&A flowed in 2025 - the highest in a decade. However,
strip out five megadeals and average deal sizes actually dropped 17%.
The tech bond distressed ratio hit 9.5%, the highest since Q4 2023. If
you're building a solid-but-not-spectacular SaaS company, the PE
escape hatch is closed. You can't build to $20M ARR and assume someone
will buy you anymore. Growth is currency again - and "efficient
growth" no longer substitutes for actual growth. 

 WHY IQ AND EQ AREN'T ENOUGH ANYMORE. THE AGE OF AI DEMANDS AQ. (9
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The rise of AI demands a focus on Agency Quotient (AQ), the ability
to actualize and execute effectively, which surpasses traditional
metrics like IQ and EQ. High AQ individuals transform intentions into
reality, essential in an AI-driven world where passive reliance on
technology risks overshadowing human initiative. As AI democratizes
intelligence, those who direct and build, rather than simply consume,
will thrive, making AQ a critical skill for future productivity and
innovation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE OPENING, MIDGAME, AND ENDGAME IN STARTUPS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Startups should simultaneously strategize for the opening, midgame,
and endgame stages to avoid pitfalls and ensure growth. Successful
founders balance initiating new ideas, achieving product-market fit,
and envisioning future impact. This holistic approach enables nimble
decision-making and sustained momentum, making businesses adaptable
and resilient. 

 THE LIGHTHOUSE PLAYBOOK (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In environments of abundance, the strongest signal isn't what you
broadcast - it's what others say about you. This playbook flips
standard growth advice: instead of building your brand, find people
already on your team who are respected in networks you care about and
invest in building their brands. Not influencer marketing - the
opposite. Linear tells the world something about you because of how it
positions craft. Stripe didn't say "payment processing" - they said
"increasing the GDP of the internet. AI has lowered the cost of
building products toward zero, but it hasn't done anything to change
the cost of attracting people to you.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE AI PRICING AND MONETIZATION PLAYBOOK (30 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI isn't free to deliver, unlike traditional software. Compute and
inference costs weigh heavily on AI monetization strategy. Every AI
query incurs a non-trivial expense, which pricing must account for
while capturing the value services create. This article looks at
patterns and pitfalls from the experiences of dozens of AI teams to
see how best to price an AI product. 

 THINGS AREN'T CHANGING THAT FAST (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 New announcements are coming out of the AI industry every day, but
not much has actually changed for most people. The people talking
about AI are the people whose daily experience of AI is genuinely
transformative, because they're the ones building and using it at the
frontier. This creates a situation where the discourse is dominated by
people for whom AI has changed everything. While the technology is
advancing at a remarkable pace, the diffusion of that technology into
the broader economy is proceeding at a much more normal pace. AI is
subject to the same frictions as every other technology.
