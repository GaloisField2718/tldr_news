HEADLINES & TRENDS

 LLMS VS. MARKETPLACES (16 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google has long tried to take profit away from lead gen marketplaces.
OpenAI is now going for that pool with ChatGPT. Its technology makes
search much better by understanding intent, and it can transact on
users' behalf, allowing the company to push further into the
marketplace stack than Google and do everything a transactional
marketplace can. Many marketplaces will come out of this transition
just fine. 

 CONTEXT IS THE NEW MOAT (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Different teams can use the same model but get different results. The
context is now the moat. Context is the structured knowledge that
helps models understand specific situations. Good context results in
better outputs, which can, in turn, improve context for future runs.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GROWTH IS NOW A TRUST PROBLEM (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Traditional distribution channels are falling apart. SEO is getting
killed by AI slop and people going straight to ChatGPT for answers.
Paid search costs are skyrocketing. Corporate social gets no juice
from the algorithm. What's working now is employee-led social, creator
partnerships, and community-driven growth. They all feed into word of
mouth. On the retention side, AI is commoditizing the value props most
SaaS companies were built on. If your pitch is "faster than the manual
approach," you're now competing with something that costs $20/month.
When capabilities get commoditized, users stick with products they
trust. 

 28 HARD-WON STARTUP LESSONS AFTER 20+ FAILED ATTEMPTS (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The author distills lessons from two decades of failed startups,
emphasizing validating demand early, prioritizing users over ego, and
building before chasing investors or co-founders. He argues for
bootstrapping, pricing higher, avoiding free tiers, hiring only doers,
and shipping fast with minimal teams and boilerplates. He also warns
against hype cycles, consumer apps, corporates, and long-running dead
projects, while highlighting SEO, daily writing, and audience
alignment as long-term advantages.

 WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO IPO? (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Back in 2021, every founder said they were two years away from an
IPO. Just a couple actually made it. Only 5% of unicorns are both
above $300M ARR and have a Rule of 40+ score. The other 95% are
zombies. Of the 52 cloud companies that have IPOed since 2018, only 7
have beaten the QQQ ETF. If you actually are on the path, IPO planning
should start 18-24 months out. Accounting is the number one reason for
delayed IPOs, and the list of what finance teams need to get right is
longer than most founders expect. 

 THE PHYSICAL AI DEPLOYMENT GAP (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Physical AI could be the biggest market in human history, but most
robotics companies are stuck demoing instead of deploying. A system
that works 95% of the time in the lab might drop to 60% in the real
world. Production requires 99.9% reliability. At 95%, a picking robot
fails 50 times per day, and each failure needs a human to step in. The
gap won't close through research breakthroughs alone but through
infrastructure and tooling that don't exist yet. This article maps
exactly where those opportunities are for founders building in the
space.
