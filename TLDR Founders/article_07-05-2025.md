HEADLINES & TRENDS

 PARTNERING WITH LISTEN LABS: NEXT-LEVEL CUSTOMER OBSESSION (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Listen Labs revolutionizes market research with an AI-powered
platform, allowing businesses to understand customers in depth and
scale. Sequoia supports Listen's mission to automate and streamline
customer research processes, significantly reducing time and costs.
Listen has already conducted over 300,000 interviews for major
companies like Microsoft and Canva, demonstrating its potential to
transform product development across various industries. 

 OPENAI BACKTRACKS ON PLANS TO DROP NONPROFIT CONTROL (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 OpenAI announced its restructuring as a public benefit corporation
with the nonprofit that controls it remaining its largest shareholder.
This reverses earlier plans to shift control to investors, which had
drawn criticism from Elon Musk (who sued the company) and regulatory
scrutiny from California and Delaware attorneys general. While Sam
Altman called the change a "more understandable structure," Musk's
lawyer dismissed it as a "transparent dodge" that still betrays the
company's mission. 

 DOORDASH IS ON A $5 BILLION BUYING SPREE AFTER EARNINGS BEAT (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DoorDash just splurged $5 billion in five hours, buying SevenRooms
($1.2B) and Deliveroo ($3.9B). This massive spending spree transforms
it from US delivery leader to global hospitality tech giant with
access to 50 million monthly users across 40+ countries.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PRICING GUIDE FOR EARLY-STAGE STARTUPS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most founders admit their early pricing is essentially a guess. Focus
on learning rather than maximizing revenue before finding
product-market fit. Freemium converts only 2-5% of users but can drive
massive adoption, while paid pilots convert an impressive 60-90% of
customers. Your pricing sends strong signals about your positioning -
Superhuman launched at $30/month to appear premium, while Atlassian
used rock-bottom pricing to spread virally through organizations.
Treat early pricing as an experiment, run small tests, and be ready to
adjust as you learn what your market actually values. 

 MACH CEO ON BUILDING DEFENSE TECH COMPANY IN YOUR 20S (1 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Mach CEO Ethan Thornton discussed his company's recent U.S. military
contract and plans for cross-functional factories at the StrictlyVC
2025 event. Thornton aims to compete with China in weapons systems
development. 

 TARIFFS, VOLATILITY, AND THE STARTUP EXIT DILEMMA (3 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Exit uncertainty and potential recession are creating challenges for
venture capital, which has seen record investment but weak exits since
2020. The threshold for IPOs and M&A has increased, further stalling
exits amid high interest rates and market volatility. Lowering
interest rates could stabilize the market, but significant exit
volumes remain unlikely except for top-tier companies.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NICHES ARE LARGER THAN YOU'D THINK (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Counterintuitively, focusing on a narrow audience creates more value
than chasing mass appeal. By diving deep into tech CFO topics that
seem "too niche," the author built a podcast that just hit “stadium
level” capacity in downloads. Your staying power is the key –
consistently delivering insider knowledge that resonates so deeply
with your core audience that adjacent groups want in too. When you
speak to the core loudly enough, everyone else starts listening. 

 THE DOWNSIDE OF SECONDARIES (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Secondary sales give employees and investors liquidity in today's
slow IPO market, but they come with a significant hidden cost. These
transactions raise your company's 409A valuation by providing evidence
of common stock value, which increases the exercise price for all
future option grants. One executive found secondaries added $0.50 to
his option price, costing him an extra $1M on his 2M share grant. When
you want to sell shares, secondaries seem great. When you join a
company and get options, they reduce your upside. Most employees never
know these transactions happened, but they might be silently erasing
millions in potential gains. 

 REFLECTIONS AFTER A MONTH BACK IN VC (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The seed ecosystem has rapidly expanded, with more funds and faster
deal closing, but standing out as a VC firm remains challenging. Many
successful seed funds are increasing in size, leading to larger checks
and fewer diverse perspectives in funding rounds. Liquidity
opportunities have grown with more secondary market activity, while
some funds are adjusting their reserve strategies due to abundant
capital.

QUICK LINKS

 SAFE HANDS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 "Safe Hands" people transform how founders scale their companies –
these are the team members you can delegate to without worry knowing
they'll execute with quality, communicate proactively, and solve
problems independently regardless of their title or experience. 

 WHAT MAKES A VC FUND "TIER 1"? (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Most venture capital funds can't be judged on performance for nearly
a decade, leaving reputation to fill the gap. 

 GOOGLE CLOUD CEO THOMAS KURIAN ON AI COMPETITION, AGENTS, AND TARIFFS
(13 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google Cloud, under CEO Thomas Kurian, attributes its recent 30%
growth in quarterly revenue partly to the adoption of generative AI,
leveraging in-house capabilities like DeepMind and over 200 models.
