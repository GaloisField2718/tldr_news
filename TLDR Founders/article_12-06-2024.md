STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE FIRST 3 MARKETS IN ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE STARTUPS (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Enterprise startups must sequentially tackle three distinct market
segments to build the right product and sales motion: Innovators,
Early Adopters, and the Early Majority. Startups can drive adoption,
iterate on product, and establish a repeatable sales process by
methodically dominating each market segment with clear success metrics
before proceeding. Skip this sequence and risk wasting precious time
and capital.

 GREAT SOFTWARE TEAMS DON'T RELEASE IN PHASES (3 MINUTE READ) [14]

truly acting on user feedback. Instead, stay open to changing

culture, and significantly ups your company valuation in the early
days. Investing in your sales team's success is a powerful strategy
for startups doubling down on GTM and seeking to scale quickly.
