HEADLINES & TRENDS

 DEFENSIBILITY: WHERE WILL VALUE ACCRUE IN AI? (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, simply building a “10x
better” product is no longer enough for long-term success. As
advanced AI tools become widely accessible, the competitive edge
shifts from creating standout products to continuously adapting and
integrating new advancements. Success now depends on a startup's
ability to leverage execution speed and adapt to ongoing shifts in the
market, which helps ensure resilience against constant waves of
disruption. 

 GOOGLE'S LEADERSHIP SHAKEUP: LONG COMING (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's leadership changes reflect an effort to address struggles in
search quality and AI. Prabhakar Raghavan's shift to Chief
Technologist seems to be more about damage control than Raghavan's
desire to "return to his roots." Ongoing antitrust pressures could
force structural changes, like splitting off Chrome or the Play Store.
Google faces challenges with its ad model as user behavior shifts.
With Demis Hassabis now leading AI efforts, a strategic pivot is
possible, but the path forward remains uncertain amid tough
competition. 

 POSITIVE B2B AI SIGNS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Morgan Stanley's “GenAI Adoption - 2 Years In” report shows that
40% of AI projects have exceeded ROI expectations, with only 10%
underperforming, compared to a typical 20-30% failure rate for IT
projects. Larger companies gain more from AI because the fixed costs
— like data cleaning — are similar across different sizes. This
allows a $400 million company to automate more with the same
investment as a $100 million firm. Bigger budgets also help refine AI
strategies, making large enterprises more competitive. As a result,
they are leading in GenAI adoption, focusing on maximizing returns
through careful planning.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW COPY.AI IS COMBATING GTM BLOAT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Copy.ai's revenue shot up 3.5x in just eight months by evolving from
a simple AI copy tool into a powerful Go-to-Market (GTM) platform. The
new focus? Automating the clunky, time-consuming processes that bog
down sales and marketing teams — aka "GTM bloat." By offering
targeted packages that quickly deliver ROI, Copy.ai made it easy for
big companies to start using the platform and scale up from there. A
pay-as-you-go pricing model kept things low-risk, helping drive rapid
adoption. 

 DECENTRALIZED CREATIVITY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Going viral doesn't always require a big ad budget. CheaterBuster's
strategy is a playbook in decentralized creativity — hand over
control to a swarm of creators and let them do the heavy lifting. By
launching an affiliate program where anyone could use pre-made clips
to create TikToks, CheaterBuster racked up 350M views and quadrupled
its web traffic. Rewards tied directly to performance kept creators
motivated, while the organic, trend-aligned content flourished on
TikTok's feed. 

 HOW TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE IN A GROWING ORGANIZATION (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stuck in a knowledge silo? You're not alone — 45% of developers say
they hit info roadblocks every week. Create spaces like “Guilds”
for teams to swap knowledge, focus on “just enough” documentation
that stays relevant, and pair new hires with mentors who can guide
them through the maze. These tweaks make sharing information easier,
boosting teamwork and cutting down on wasted time.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT DO YOU DO WITH AN IDEA? (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Are ideas truly getting harder to find, or is the real challenge
turning old ideas into progress? Many valuable concepts from the 1950s
and 1960s remain underutilized, held back by regulatory and economic
barriers. Instead of relying solely on more researchers or waiting for
AI, progress requires reducing these obstacles and making older ideas
economically viable. Examples like nuclear energy's resurgence show
how modern tech and demand can revive old concepts. The key is
reactivating these ideas, aligning incentives, and creating space for
both new innovations and forgotten solutions to thrive. 

 WHEN TO MOVE BEYOND PROMPTING TO FINE-TUNING (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Fine-tuning is like giving your AI a specialized degree — it's the
right move when companies have exhausted improvements with prompt
engineering or need more precise, tailored outputs to meet high
customer expectations. For example, Harvey, a legal tech startup, used
fine-tuning to boost its AI's accuracy by 15-20% for complex legal
language. While it comes with higher costs, fine-tuning becomes
essential when you need the reliability and precision that general
models can't provide, like accurately interpreting contracts or
handling sensitive financial data. 

 WHY ARE WE DRAWN TO LOW PROBABILITY? (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Why do we chase risky bets even when the odds are stacked against us?
Whether it's gambling on stocks or skipping seatbelts, people often
focus on the slim chance of a reward, overlooking the significant
risks. It's a mix of wanting to feel in control and convincing
ourselves that “it won't happen to me.” Investors, too, fall into
this trap, chasing big gains while underestimating just how rare those
wins are. A more grounded approach would focus on weighing risks
against probabilities, rather than being swayed by the allure of
potential rewards.
