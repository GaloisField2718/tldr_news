 ROCKET RAISES $15M TO LEAD VIBE SOLUTIONING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Rocket [4] has raised a $15M seed round co-led by Salesforce Ventures
and Accel, with participation from Together Fund, to scale the world's
first _vibe solutioning_ platform. Unlike first-gen “vibe coding”
tools that stop at prototypes, Rocket solves for Day 0 (solutioning
with context), Day 1 (rapid creation), and Day 2 (iterations,
maintenance, integrations). In just 15 weeks, more than 400,000 users
across 180+ countries have built over 500,000 production-ready apps.
With enterprise-grade code, contextual research, and multi-agent
orchestration, Rocket is redefining how founders and teams ship
products at scale.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT KILLS MOTIVATION? (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lack of belief in a payoff leads to burnout and loss of motivation,
not just hard work itself. It's crucial to distinguish between a
"Dip," where persistence might lead to success, and a "Cul-De-Sac,"
where effort yields no progress. Assess your work's potential for
progress and pivot if the path forward lacks hope to avoid burnout. 

 RAISE INSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL OR MAKE DO WITHOUT (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A startup weighing institutional capital knows it aids growth and
visibility through limitless funds, but pressures short-term
decision-making. Conversely, forgoing such capital allows strategic
flexibility and long-term planning but limits growth potential.
Entrepreneurs must carefully weigh these options according to their
goals and aspirations.

 AGENT + HUMAN OPS: HOW AI IS CHANGING ROLES AND WORKFLOWS AT BREX (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Brex's CTO built an internal AI platform that lets any employee spin
up agents in minutes, turning the company's COO's operations team from
people managers into agent managers. The shift is radical - disputes
that took 3 hours now take 3 seconds, AI does 100% of quality
assurance on all interactions, and over 50% of customer support is
fully automated. Most L1 roles managing basic tasks are gone, replaced
by L2s who now prompt engineers and coach AI instead of coaching
humans. Brex even changed its hiring to test AI fluency with case
studies where candidates must show their prompts, not just results,
because it believes operations can be 5-10x more efficient when teams
have their own automation. 

 THE MATH OF HYPERGROWTH: TWO PATHS TO THE SAME GOAL (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Slack and Atlassian were worth the same $27 billion when Salesforce
bought Slack, but Slack got there in 7 years while Atlassian took 17.
The difference illustrates two paths to massive value - hypergrowth or
steady compounding over decades. OpenAI is growing 400% at $1 billion
revenue, while Atlassian grew 30% at that scale, yet Snowflake's 124%
growth path built a $75 billion company versus Atlassian's $42
billion. The lesson is that reaching $1 billion revenue faster creates
significantly more value due to time value of money - hypergrowth
beats slow and steady even if you eventually hit the same revenue,
though most companies can't optimize growth, margin, and retention
simultaneously.

launched its AI-driven Agent 3, enhancing cloud-based software
