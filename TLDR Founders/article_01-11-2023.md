HEADLINES & TRENDS

 LESSONS LEARNED FROM A STARTUP THAT DIDN‚ÄôT MAKE IT (11 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 An insightful read from a founder of a venture-backed B2B startup
that shut down. The biggest takeaways include: You need to really nail
your ICP and build vertical use cases if you‚Äôre playing a horizontal
game, don‚Äôt underestimate incumbents, and be mindful of confirmation
bias from the supporters around you. 

 STARTUP MAKE-BELIEVE (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 We put this in the highlight because it‚Äôs a needed reminder. As
founders, we like to look at the competition or the best in class
companies out there. Sometimes this can be useful, most of the time
it‚Äôs not. You cannot copy Google. Its search business is so
profitable that it can afford to do all those quirky things, your
startup likely can‚Äôt. Focus on you. 

 THE STATE OF VC IN 2023 (30 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sam Lessin, a partner at Slow Ventures and former VP Product at
Facebook, put out an 84-page slide deck recently that digs into the
state of venture capital. It‚Äôs a long but very enjoyable read that
gives a poignant view of the landscape.

 EXAMPLES THAT BRING GROSS MARGIN CALCULATIONS TO LIFE (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 You likely wave the figure around when talking to investors, but do
you really understand what goes into calculating your gross margin?
Here are some live examples to help bring it to life. 

 A SIMPLE FRAMEWORK FOR EXPONENTIAL GROWTH (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A bundle of insights from Lavanya Shukla, VP of Growth at Weights &
Biases, on how to build a user acquisition flywheel instead of a
funnel. 

 LETTERS TO A YOUNG INVESTOR WITH REID HOFFMAN (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Asking the question of what advice you‚Äôd give a younger version of
yourself is a super interesting exercise and this time done
specifically with Reid Hoffman. Hint: he missed Stripe.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SYNCHRONIZING ASYNCHRONOUS REMOTE WORK (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In-office, hybrid, remote‚Äìwhatever working model you choose,
there‚Äôs always trade-offs. If you‚Äôre even partially remote,
igniting a sense of personal responsibility with your employees is
critical. They need to know what their company objectives are, why
they were chosen, and exactly how their role and daily work relates
back to them. 

 WHAT DOES TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED PUBLIC SAFETY LOOK LIKE? (4 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 a16z is calling this ‚ÄúThe Superhero stack.‚Äù They dive into what
role tech startups might play in changing how we think about public
safety and security response. 

 THE IMPACT OF ANTI-TRUST ON M&A IN STARTUPLAND (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Given the high concentration of cash and equity tied up in the top
companies and their inability to do anything with it because of
antitrust concerns, it will definitely put a damper on the M&A market
with no end in sight.

QUICK LINKS

 THOUGHTS ON FOUNDER VESTING STRUCTURES (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Having a fully-vested co-founder or key hire depart the company is a
killer. To hedge against this predictable outcome, more founders
should adopt longer vesting cycles for themselves and the earliest big
equity employees. 

 ASK AT THE END OF EVERY VC PITCH: WHAT ARE THE ODDS YOU WOULD INVEST?
(1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This question acts as a forcing function for feedback. You‚Äôll know
where you stand, and the investor will also be confronted with the
need to refine their thinking a little. 

 BIDEN‚ÄôS AI ORDER MAY HAVE WIDE IMPACT FOR STARTUPS (3 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Biden has gone all in on an executive order that, while lacking
teeth, gives a good sense of where the administration is coming from
when it comes to AI, and from that, we can glean potential impacts on
the startup ecosystem.
