HEADLINES & TRENDS

 M&A SWEET SPOT (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 2025 has seen a surge in mid-sized tech acquisitions like ServiceNow
buying Moveworks ($2.9B) and Coreweave acquiring Weights & Biases
($1.7B). Most deals fall in the $1B-$5B range—a critical insight for
startups raising capital. 

 RISE OF THE AI WRAPPERS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Big AI companies are practically giving away their best models, and
smart founders are cashing in. The pattern is spreading to design,
video editing, and beyond. There's tension here: model providers want
you to use more AI, while wrapper companies try to minimize those
costs. For now, both sides win. The smart play isn't building your own
AI but moving fast, capturing your market, and collecting data that
becomes valuable later. 

 THE FINTECH POWER RANKINGS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This ranking reveals which fintech revenue models investors value
most: SaaS and payments at the top, followed by AUM fees, trading,
debit interchange, float, insurance, and lending at the bottom.
Companies like Stripe earn 20x multiples by stacking multiple types.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO USE 1ST PARTY AND 3RD PARTY SIGNALS IN ABM (4 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Most companies use signals wrong—personalized cold outreach still
fails when the buying group doesn't know you. Research shows 72% of
B2B SaaS CMOs start their vendor search in private communities, not
through Google, and trust peers more than vendor outreach. The winning
approach follows a 4-step framework: generate your own 1st party
signals through targeted content, build relationships before pitching,
match activities to buyer journey stages, and prepare champions with
content that helps them sell internally. 

 BUILDING UNDER CONSTRAINT: THE $10M/EMPLOYEE PLAYBOOK (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Startups built today can design around AI from scratch, but what
about existing companies with 50+ employees? This case study from Swan
shows what's possible - building a $30M ARR business with just three
co-founders by setting a radical constraint: $10M ARR per employee.
The company's "agentic swarm" of AI tools handles everything from
content creation to lead qualification, allowing one person to run its
entire GTM motion. 

 BURN THE OLD PLAYBOOK (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Sales tactics that worked yesterday are dead today—call connect
rates have dropped from 15% to 1%, and buyers research products
without reps. You can't grow by spamming people anymore, even with
fancy AI tools.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GROWTH-STAGE COMPANIES ACQUIRING SMALL TECHNICAL TEAMS (1 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 There has been a wave of growth-stage companies quietly acquiring
small technical teams. It's a smart way to lock in top-tier talent,
and for founders without PMF, often the cleanest soft landing. 

 BUILDING EXECUTIVE PRESENCE (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Executive presence often gets overlooked as founders focus on
product-market fit and operations. As your company grows, influencing
senior stakeholders becomes crucial. To build this skill, focus on
clarifying your message rather than showcasing expertise. Connect your
work to broader company goals. Give executives the context they need
without overwhelming details. Approach problems with potential
solutions in hand. This skill develops through practice and ultimately
determines how much support your initiatives receive. 

 THE APPLICATION LAYER (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 "There's an AI for that" will soon be how we talk about software
across every industry. This pattern will repeat in healthcare,
education, and law. Winners will create exceptional experiences that
solve specific problems, not just deploy marginally better algorithms.
Vertical AI apps succeed by fitting perfectly into workflows people
already have, making tasks faster and easier. In the end, users don't
care which AI scores better on technical benchmarks, they care which
one actually makes their work better.
