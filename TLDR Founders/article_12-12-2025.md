 HAVE YOU CHOSEN THE WRONG PRICING MODEL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Seat-based, usage-based, or outcome-based: which pricing strategy is
right? Most founders pick a model based on what competitors do, not
what fits their product. 

METRONOME - the monetization platform that helps leaders like OPENAI,
ANTHROPIC, and NVIDIA match pricing to value - has a new
self-assessment [4] that can tell you whether you're on the right
track. Answer these 8 questions [4] to discover the pricing strategy
that best fits how your customers get value from your product.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 8 TAKEAWAYS FROM CARTA'S STATE OF SEED REPORT (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Seed funding is back to near-peak levels, but the money is
significantly harder to touch. Investors are piling more cash into
fewer rounds, essentially ignoring everything outside of SF and NY.
The most telling stat is headcount: the average seed startup has
slimmed down from 10 people to just 6, likely because AI is picking up
the slack. However, don't let the tools fool you into going it alone:
VCs still fund co-founders at double the rate of solo acts, despite
the data showing that 25% of those partnerships end in a breakup by
year four. 

 HARDWARE IS A FRUIT (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The feedback loop for physical products is speeding up. We used to
assume that building hardware meant long timelines and high costs for
every mistake. That dynamic is fading. Modern simulation tools and AI
assistants now let engineers iterate on physical designs almost as
fast as they write code. The barrier to entry is shifting from
manufacturing logistics to pure design capability.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DRIVING EXTREME CLARITY (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 At your startup, it's important to recognize that a "messy yes" is
often more dangerous than a hard "no." Teams tend to drift into
"strategic ambiguity" - nodding along to avoid conflict without
actually agreeing on the trade-offs. The fix is to force the friction
upfront: make the team stack-rank priorities (no ties allowed) and
write down exactly where you disagree. 

 RL IN REAL LIFE: DURABLE MOATS (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Reinforcement learning (RL) has gone from being a promising path
towards general intelligence to a taboo phrase over the past year. It
has proved highly effective inside AI labs, but outside of the labs,
its use cases remain surprisingly underdeveloped. Most efforts appear
to be largely experimental and have yet to scratch the surface of the
sophisticated techniques used within the frontier labs. This post
looks at the intricacies of building effective RL approaches, assesses
current use cases, and discusses what founders should consider when
commercializing RL-based systems.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A FEW THOUGHTS ON CONVICTION (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The venture capital industry is full of sheep. Funds blindly follow
others without thinking for themselves. They lack all conviction. As a
result, they don't blaze new trails - and blazing new trails is the
only way to earn outsized returns in a hyper-competitive market as an
investor or an operator. 

 WHY STARTUPS DIE (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Most startups eventually fail. This is rarely because of competition.
Most of the time, their demise is self-inflicted by internal issues.
The biggest threats usually come from within the company's own walls,
not from the outside world.
