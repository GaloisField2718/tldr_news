 THE TOP 100 [GEN AI] CONSUMER APPS (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Gen AI ecosystem is stabilizing. There were only 11 new names on
Andreessen Horowitz's most recent Top 100 Gen AI Consumer Apps list,
compared to 17 newcomers in the March ranking. There were
significantly more mobile newcomers as app stores have cracked down on
ChatGPT copycats, opening up room for more original apps. ChatGPT is
still the leading general assistant, but Google, Grok, and Meta are
closing the gap. More on the top Gen AI consumer apps is available in
the article. 

 NVIDIA REPORTS RECORD SALES AS THE AI BOOM CONTINUES (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, reported $46.7 billion in
revenue this quarter, a 56% increase compared to the same period last
year. AI-dominated data center business largely fuelled that growth.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SEO IS A WASTE OF TIME IF IT DOESN'T FOCUS ON SCALE (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 It's easy to create SEO busywork that feels productive - fixing meta
tags on pages nobody visits, chasing keywords with zero searches,
updating old blog posts - but these won't change anything. What works
is fixing problems across thousands of pages at once: repairing broken
links everywhere, updating all your category templates, and rebuilding
how your site connects pages. Start with pages already getting traffic
to prove you can improve them, then fix the bigger structural
problems. 

 STOP SELLING A SAAS SOLUTION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Companies keep telling founders to stop selling features and start
selling solutions, then outcomes, then transformations, but they're
all missing what actually matters - buyers don't trust that software
alone will get them results. Don't make your tool the hero of the
story and make your team the hero instead. Instead of saying "our
magical tool solves your problem," say "we are the team that will
solve your problem, and this tool is our weapon." 

 THE SCARIEST FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE YOUR TEAM (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Managers lie to themselves about their teams - they convince
themselves someone is "pretty good" to avoid replacing them, or
haven't updated their opinion since that person was great two years
ago. The solution is plotting everyone on a 2x2 matrix of performance
(Do they deliver on time and understand business impact? Can they work
without creating friction?) versus potential (Can they think
strategically and hold their own with senior leaders? Do people follow
them?).

 MASS INTELLIGENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A billion people now use AI regularly, but until recently, only 7% of
paying ChatGPT users even knew to choose the best models from the
menu. The cost of running AI has collapsed - GPT-5 nano costs 14 cents
per million tokens versus $50 for the original GPT-4. Every
institution built for scarce, expensive intelligence now has to figure
out what happens when a billion people have tools that outperform
humans at intellectual tasks. 

 CHICKENS TALKING TO DUCKS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 There's a Cantonese saying about chickens talking to ducks - both
speaking their language, both making sense, neither understanding the
other. When the author had breast cancer, her husband kept saying
"you'll be fine" while working through the night closing his company
sale, which felt like dismissal until she realized he wasn't
reassuring her - he was reassuring himself. This same dynamic happens
constantly between founders and investors, founders and employees,
founders and spouses - each person speaking their own language of fear
or control, thinking they're communicating when they're actually
talking past each other. Her husband, watching both her parents die of
cancer, needed to believe she'd be fine to function. She needed him to
acknowledge her fear to feel heard. She finally said, "I know
statistically I'll be fine, but right now I need you to hear that I'm
scared" - and everything changed. 

 WHAT ARE THE TOP 10 THINGS TO PUT IN A SERIES A DECK? (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 A successful Series A pitch deck should include a compelling
one-slide summary, clear problem-solution articulation, and key
traction metrics. Highlight the market opportunity and explain why
your team and product are uniquely positioned to succeed. Ensure the
financial plan is realistic, make a clear funding ask, and present a
polished, visually appealing deck sent to investors in advance.
