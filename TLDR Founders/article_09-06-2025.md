HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE IPO DOOR IS SWINGING OPEN (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The IPO market just cracked open with two unlikely heroes: a GPU
infrastructure company and a stablecoin issuer. CoreWeave went public
in March and shot up 300% on $1 billion quarterly revenue, while
Circle jumped 168% on its first trading day to an $18 billion market
cap. 

 HOW TO SPOT ERR (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Many SaaS companies think they have stable recurring revenue when
they actually have experimental revenue that could vanish overnight.
McDonald's canceling its AI drive-thru instantly killed vendor revenue
- a perfect example of ERR (Experimental Run Rate) vs real ARR. The
warning signs are everywhere and mistaking ERR for ARR leads to
overhiring, burning cash, and fundraising at valuations you can't grow
into.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW PLAID FOUND PULL (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Plaid wasted months building finance apps nobody wanted until Venmo
suffered through a painful purchasing process to buy its bank
connection backend. That pain proved the demand was real. While Venmo
was still buying, Plaid pitched 15 other fintechs with a simple
question: "Venmo doesn't want to manage bank integrations themselves -
how are you different?" Turns out nobody was different - they all
bought Plaid's janky automations because building connections to
thousands of banks themselves was impossible. 

 SHOULD YOU "RENT" AN EXEC FOR YOUR STARTUP? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A wave of senior execs are ditching full-time work to become
"fractional" leaders - part-time operators who embed in startups to
solve specific problems. You can tap them to close enterprise deals
when you have no sales leader and build financial models before you
can afford a CFO. The real unlock though is that watching them do the
job teaches you exactly what to look for when you finally hire
full-time. 

 HOW I'D RUN A SAAS PRICING PROJECT FROM SCRATCH (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most startup SaaS companies think about pricing by raising prices 20%
and crossing their fingers. However, there are actually different
strategies depending on your company stage – the 20% approach can
work for new companies that need simple pricing that works, but as you
grow, your pricing needs to adapt in this specific order: how many
plans you offer, when customers hit usage limits, what features cost
extra, and only then the actual prices.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 ☠️ VIRTUAL DESKTOPS ARE DEAD! SECURE DATA AND APPS (LOCALLY)
INSTEAD (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Relying on VDI to secure contractors and remote employees on
unmanaged computers isn't necessary! Venn's Secure Enclave technology
[11] isolates and protects work data and all apps locally on a user's
PC or Mac. Ditch legacy VDI. Quickly secure work on any device. SEE
VENN IN ACTION [11] 

 UNUSUAL AI (TOOL) [12] 

 Drives pipeline by delivering personalized content to each website
visitor. 

 EXTROVERT (TOOL) [13] 

 Extrovert helps you engage prospects on LinkedIn by tracking posts,
identifying key conversations with AI, and enabling your team to
comment thoughtfully at scale. 

 POTPIE AI (TOOL) [14] 

 Potpie AI lets you create custom AI agents that handle engineering
tasks like debugging, system design, and onboarding with precision,
using context from your own codebase.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE COMPLEXITY CRISIS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI makes building apps so easy that companies will soon juggle
thousands of them - but they all require connecting to legacy systems
nobody can replace. This creates a massive mess that someone has to
fix. Accenture is already winning by helping companies deal with this
chaos. The big money may not be in building another app - it's in
being the middleman who connects everything. 

 CONTEXT, COLLABORATION, INTENT, AND INVESTMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Most companies waste incredible energy chasing quarterly goals while
ignoring the foundational models that actually drive success. One
company discovered that 20 teams had built business cases to move the
same metric - if all succeeded, it would have increased 500%, which
was physically impossible. The fix isn't better planning but
understanding four basics: Context (customer journeys and capability
maps), Intent (what you're trying to achieve), Collaboration (how
teams work together), and Investment (where you put resources). 

 HOW BLOCKCHAIN COULD REVOLUTIONIZE VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY
(7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Blockchain could revolutionize venture capital by using tokenization,
smart contracts, and DeFi to increase transparency, efficiency, and
accessibility. Tokenization allows fractional ownership and liquidity,
while smart contracts automate transactions and compliance. However,
challenges such as regulatory ambiguity and technical risks remain
significant hurdles.
