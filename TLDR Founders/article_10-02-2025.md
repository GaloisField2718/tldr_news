 DELVE: AI THAT MAKES COMPLIANCE EFFORTLESS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Need SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR sorted out without the 60 hours of busywork?

YC-backed Delve is using AI agents to make the compliance process 75%
faster than anyone else. Startups like 11x, Bland, and other big
companies have switched over because of:

‚Üí A simplified process that takes only 10-15 hours
‚Üí A 1:1 Slack channel with the founding team and 24/7 customer
support
‚Üí AI code scanning that reviews PRs for vulnerabilities
‚Üí AI to help you autofill your security questionnaires

Delve does for compliance what Turbotax does for taxes. Simple,
secure, and built by founders - for founders.

BOARD PUSHED OUT ITS FOUNDER (11 MINUTE READ) [6]

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 KILLING A BAD STRATEGY BEFORE IT KILLS YOU (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Looking through 2,500 years of history can show us how to reach big
goals with limited resources. This piece shares eleven key lessons
from leaders who changed the world, from ancient times to today. It

choices now. 

 THE #1 WORST HIRE OF ALL WHEN YOU ARE JUST STARTING TO SCALE: THE
MEDIOCRE VP OF ENGINEERING (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The worst mis-hire for a startup is an ineffective CTO, as it stifles
innovation. A good CTO must be a skilled hacker, not just a manager,
to maintain the "magic" of the codebase. A mis-hire in this role can
lead to stagnation, making recovery difficult.

READ) [10]

Promoter Score (NPS), which indicates customer loyalty and the
likelihood of recommendations. Improving NPS involves fast feedback
responses, creating a customer success roadmap, empowering support

product features.

compare Gemini 2.0's performance against existing solutions across
accuracy and cost. The analysis shows why this breakthrough makes
large-scale document processing accessible to most companies while
highlighting current limitations. 

 VCS DON'T OWE YOU A RESPONSE OR A FOLLOW UP (3 MINUTE READ) [15]
