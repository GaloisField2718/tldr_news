 FTX‚ÄôS SAM BANKMAN-FRIED SENTENCED TO 25 YEARS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in
prison for orchestrating one of the largest financial frauds in
history, involving the theft of over $8 billion from customers. The
sentence falls significantly below the maximum of 110 years he faced
but exceeds the leniency his defense sought. The collapse of FTX
represents a monumental failure in the startup world, surpassing even
the Theranos scandal in scale. It has had a profound chilling effect
on venture investing in the crypto sector, though recent data suggests
a tentative recovery in crypto-related investments. 

 WHEN A BILLION DOLLAR OUTCOME ISN‚ÄôT ENOUGH (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This article discusses the challenging expectations venture funds
have for startups, noting that a $1 billion exit might not suffice for
large funds due to the power law of returns, which says that a
significant portion of returns comes from a small number of
investments. The article further delves into the importance of
understanding revenue multiples, efficiency benchmarks like CAC
Payback Period, the Rule of 40, Revenue per Employee, and the impact
of operating expenditures on a company's financial health,
highlighting the need for startups to align their growth and valuation
expectations with investors' requirements for substantial returns. 

 AVOID BLUNDERING: 80% OF A WINNING STRATEGY (19 MINUTE READ) [6]

chess, amateur tennis, and startups. Not making critical mistakes can
constitute 80% of winning. Key strategies for reducing risk and
achieving success include recognizing and steering clear of common
pitfalls, such as failing to understand customer needs or prematurely
scaling.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO DO EVENT MARKETING RIGHT (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article provides practical tips for leveraging in-person event
marketing as a growth channel. It emphasizes the importance of
selecting the right events, optimizing trade show booths, utilizing
side and partner events, engaging in guerrilla marketing, seeking
speaking opportunities, and negotiating rates to maximize impact and
generate revenue. The article highlights the distinction between field
and brand marketing events, advocating for a strategic approach to
event marketing that aligns with a company's goals and target customer
profile (ICP) for effective lead generation and brand awareness. 

 IS IT SAFE? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Using multiple SAFEs (Simple Agreements for Future Equity) for
fundraising without a clear understanding of ownership dilution can
lead to founders being surprised by how much equity they've given away
when they finally conduct a priced round. Stacked SAFEs, where
different rounds of investment occur at various valuation caps without
diluting early investors, can result in significant founder dilution
and complex cap table calculations, as well as legal and financial
complications.

 HOW PROFITABLE SHOULD SAAS BE? (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While high gross margins set the profitability ceiling, efficient
management of operating expenses (OpEx) is crucial as a company
matures and its revenue growth slows. Not all cloud companies are

significant factor in their long-term profitability and ability to
capitalize on growth opportunities or return value to shareholders.

 WHAT HAPPENS TO TECH STARTUPS THAT NEVER GO PUBLIC? (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 This article discusses the recent feeding frenzy among AI startups,
with dozens of investment firms deploying capital in the space, but
warns that the frenzy has slowed and many of these companies may face
challenges in the future. It draws parallels to the past performance
of technology companies, highlighting that many growth-stage tech
companies are marked at unsustainable valuations, and suggests that
while some may go public or be acquired, many will have to endure a
valuation reset through down round investments, subscale strategic
exits, or private equity exits.
