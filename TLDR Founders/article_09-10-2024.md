 SLOW MODELS = DEAD PRODUCTS. GET FASTER INFERENCE WITH BASETEN
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 15 years ago, Amazon found that every 100 milliseconds of latency
cost 1% of revenue. Today, 100 milliseconds kills entire products.
That's why startups building real AI-native applications, not GPT
wrappers, turn to Baseten for applied performance research,
distributed GPU infrastructure, and hands-on support.

Top teams like Descript, Patreon, and Rime choose Baseten for
mission-critical AI inference workloads:

→ Read how Bland AI achieved <400ms e2e latency [5] for real-time
phone calls while scaling usage over 50x

→ Find out how Writer serves custom 70B parameter LLMs [6] at 60%
higher tokens per second and 35% lower cost per million tokens

→ Try Baseten for yourself [4] with free model inference credits and
on-demand H100 access

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE FED RATE CUTS – WHAT HAPPENS TO SAAS AND AI MULTIPLES NOW? (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The recent interest rate cut by the Fed has not led to a significant
increase in software stock multiples contrary to expectations. This
may be due to concerns about the fundamentals of SaaS businesses,
which have shown weakening growth and plateauing profitability
metrics. As a result, investors are left wondering whether SaaS
multiples will bounce back to historical averages or settle at a new
normal, and how the rising popularity of AI companies will impact the
market. 

 REPLIT'S PATH TO PRODUCT-MARKET FIT—THE $1 BILLION SIDE PROJECT (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Amjad Masad, the founder of Replit, had a singular vision to make
software creation accessible to everyone, which guided his
entrepreneurial journey. He started Replit as a side project in 2008
to create a collaborative web-based code editor, which eventually
gained a large following and became a billion-dollar company. Through
strategic decisions, such as pivoting to a cloud-based project and
investing in AI, Masad was able to grow Replit into a leading platform
for software development. 

 INFERENCE TIME SCALING LAWS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI development is encountering a potential data limitation, prompting
a shift in focus from pre-training scaling to inference time scaling,
as seen with OpenAI's o1 model. This new approach reallocates
computational resources to allow AI to "think" and reason for extended
periods, enhancing its problem-solving capabilities. As labs invest in
inference time scaling, this could lead to significant advancements in
AI applications, particularly in areas requiring complex reasoning,
such as financial planning and strategy, while maintaining
cost-effectiveness compared to human labor.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE AHA! SHORTCUT (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Leveraging AI to deliver immediate results based on minimal input can
help users reach their "Aha!" moment faster and improve user
onboarding. This approach simplifies complex tasks, making the
onboarding process seamless and reducing friction for new users.
AI-powered onboarding can increase user engagement and motivation to
explore the platform further by providing quick wins and showcasing
the product's potential upfront. 

 BURN THE PLAYBOOKS (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The over-reliance on formulas and playbooks in various aspects of
life, such as education and entrepreneurship, is stifling creativity
and originality. Individuals are turning themselves into machines by
following predetermined steps and rules rather than embracing their
unique talents and passions. To break free from this pattern, it's
essential to reject the playbooks and focus on activities that spark
joy, creativity, and a sense of humanity. 

 RETHINKING ROAS FOR GROWTH (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Focusing solely on Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) can actually limit a
brand's growth by targeting existing heavy buyers rather than
attracting new customers. ROAS measures efficiency rather than
effectiveness - prioritizing it can lead to over-harvesting existing
customers at the expense of acquiring new ones. To achieve real
growth, brands should consider alternative metrics and strategies that
prioritize creativity and long-term impact over short-term efficiency.

 IS GOOGLE LOSING SEARCH MARKET SHARE? (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Google might lose its dominance in search advertising by 2025 due to
competition from TikTok, AI search engines, and antitrust pressures.
However, Google's market share remains robust, with search advertising
still growing. The actual challenge to Google's advertising revenue
comes from other players like Amazon, Walmart, and Instacart, which
are expanding their digital advertising presence.
