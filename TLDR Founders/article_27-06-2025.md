HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHAT DID META BUY? A PERSON? A DATASET? A CAPABILITY? (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Meta's $14 billion quasi-acquisition of Scale AI raises questions
about what it actually purchased, as Scale missed revenue targets and
lost major customers like OpenAI before the deal. 

 ANTHROPIC'S CLAUDE CAN NOW BUILD AI APPS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic is rolling out a beta feature that lets Claude users build,
host, and share AI-powered apps directly within the Claude app without
separate API costs. The feature allows Claude to write real code and
handle technical tasks, though it has limitations like restricted
external API access and no persistent data storage. 

 DON'T KICKOFF A FUNDRAISE IN LATE SUMMER (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 While fundraising data shows steady deal volume through summer
months, the real impact of VCs vacationing appears 1-2 months later as
September/October deal volume drops 15-30% from peaks. Launching a
fundraise between July 15 and August 31 means slower VC response
times, less momentum, and worse terms, so founders should either start
early summer or wait until September unless runway demands immediate
action.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE GREAT AI TALENT GRAB: THE LATEST 20VC WITH JASON, HARRY, AND RORY
(10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Silicon Valley's AI talent wars signify a major shift, with Meta
spending defensively to protect its platform by acquiring AI talent.
The success of companies like Harvey and Cluely highlights a strategy
of securing market position and customer relationships before
perfecting their technology, emphasizing speed over initial product
quality. B2B SaaS companies face crucial strategic decisions between
protecting existing revenue and embracing new AI-driven business
models to thrive in this rapidly evolving landscape. 

 SAM ALTMAN: "NO MATTER HOW GREAT YOUR IDEA IS, NO ONE CARES." (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sam Altman tells founders worried about idea theft that everyone is
too distracted to steal your concept anyway and proves it by openly
sharing YC's exact playbook with potential competitors who never
execute on the advice. 

 HOW TO FIND SUPERSTAR TALENT (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Marc Lore shares strategies for identifying and hiring top 5% talent,
emphasizing consistent company culture and early hiring of a Chief
People Officer. He highlights the rarity of "superstars" and the
importance of assessing tenure, trajectory, and cultural fit over
experience alone. Lore advocates for systematic performance management
and transparency as tools for fostering employee engagement and trust.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FIVE JOBS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 When cognitive work gets automated everything starts looking like
trade work - lawyers and electricians will have more in common than
lawyers and other professionals. The "gentle singularity" shifts human
work toward physical and relational tasks because machines can think
better than humans but can't actually be human, making what was once
common suddenly scarce and valuable. 

 THEY BUILT THE WEB. THEN LOST IT (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 CareerBuilder and Monster filed for bankruptcy after their 2024
merger couldn't save two companies that once dominated online job
hunting with $8+ billion valuations. The collapse wasn't surprising
since LinkedIn took a smarter path by building a professional network
instead of just posting job listings while the old giants never
evolved beyond resume databases as hiring moved toward specialized
platforms. 

 WHEN IS 'GOOD ENOUGH' GOOD ENOUGH? (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI excels at "good enough" work, forcing leaders to distinguish
between tasks where AI-generated output suffices (like routine emails)
and where human excellence matters (like board presentations). The key
framework asks: Does human effort create leverage? Is speed more
valuable than quality? What's the risk of getting it wrong? Smart
executives will automate low-stakes work to preserve cognitive energy
for high-impact decisions while occasionally letting teams over-invest
in craftsmanship where it truly matters.
