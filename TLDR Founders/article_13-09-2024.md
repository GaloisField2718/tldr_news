HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE EGG THEORY, APPLIED (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 It's essential to strike a balance between convenience and user
effort when designing AI-powered products. People tend to value and
trust products more when they have a sense of control and
contribution, even if it's just a small one. By incorporating moments
of human involvement, such as decision-making and approval, AI
products can increase user happiness and trust, ultimately leading to
more successful and adopted products. 

 HOW YC-BACKED ARTISAN GREW BY $700K ARR IN TWO MONTHS (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Artisan, a fast-growing startup founded in 2023, is revolutionizing
the future of work by developing AI employees, called Artisans, to
automate entire job functions, starting with sales. After initially
struggling with a self-serve model, it transitioned to a sales-led
approach, resulting in significant growth. Artisan is focused on
building an efficient inbound lead generation system and aims to
create the best outbound AI SDR on the market. It plans to expand into
other areas like marketing and customer success. 

 FROM RANDOM TO UNIFIED GTM IN 30 DAYS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Parabola revamped its approach to growth by refining its ideal
customer profile and implementing a system to create a consistent
pipeline. The company identified that its previous efforts were not
effectively targeting the right customers and decided to build a
unified system using Parabola's automation tool to track and advance
accounts through different stages. This approach allowed the team to
better understand customer engagement and run targeted campaigns,
ultimately aiming to translate these efforts into repeatable revenue.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MY EA GIVES ME SUPERPOWERS, AND YOU CAN GET SOME TOO (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Having a skilled executive assistant can significantly enhance
productivity and streamline daily tasks, allowing founders to focus on
high-priority projects and strategic thinking. Individuals can save
substantial time and energy by leveraging tools like Workflowy,
Calendly, and Prepared and implementing efficient workflows for tasks
like email drafting, meeting preparation, and research. Integrating an
executive assistant into one's daily routine can lead to significant
improvements in effectiveness and overall productivity. 

 TELL YOUR STORY WHEN FUNDRAISING (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stop letting investors dictate your story. The best way to win
funding is by owning your narrative. Instead of trying to guess what
investors want, focus on why you believe your business is fundable.
When you're confident in your story, pitching becomes natural, and
investors can see you're the expert on your company. 

 BENCHMARKING IS BAD (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Luca Maestri, Apple's former CFO, served for 11 years before stepping
down. He strongly opposed using benchmarks and instead emphasized the
importance of forming efficient teams. He believed that having the
right people is more crucial than having a large workforce. Maestri
argued that relying on benchmark data can lead to poor
decision-making, as it may not accurately reflect current economic
conditions. While beneficial for investors, benchmarking can be
detrimental for decision-makers if used incorrectly due to variations
in definitions, accounting practices, and historical data.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FAVORITISM (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's recent updates have increased visibility for brands in
certain verticals, such as finance and SaaS, while other areas like
fashion and health show mixed results. Brands benefit from higher
conversion rates and preferential treatment due to consumer trust and
demand, leading to challenges for smaller sites and SEO aggregators.
To compete, non-established brands should focus on improving
reputation through third-party reviews, investing in brand marketing,
and monitoring brand recall and mentions. 

 SOFTWARE WITH A SOUL: AI'S UNDERESTIMATED FRONTIER (6 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Recent advancements in AI have led to the emergence of "Software with
a Soul" - AI that exhibits human-like qualities such as empathy,
intuition, and emotional expression. This new paradigm is expected to
open up new markets and opportunities, particularly in fields where
there is a scarcity of human connection and understanding. The
development of a full-stack AI system with a "brain," visual
experience, and physical embodiment will be crucial in creating
software that can replicate the experience of interacting with a human
being. 

 BEING AN "N OF 1" FIRM (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 To be a successful venture capitalist, it's crucial to differentiate
yourself and become a top choice for founders in your focus areas.
Some firms achieve this by employing unique strategies or having
exceptional individuals, allowing them to become the sole preferred
investor for certain companies. Pursuing a non-consensus approach and
playing by your own rules, while risky, can potentially lead to
outstanding returns if executed well.
