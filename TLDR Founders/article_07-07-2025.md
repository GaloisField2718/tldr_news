HEADLINES & TRENDS

 NFDG: THE $1.1B VC FUND THAT 4X'D IN TWO YEARS—THEN GOT ACQUIRED BY
META (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 NFDG, a $1.1 billion AI-focused VC fund led by Nat Friedman and
Daniel Gross, achieved a 4x return in two years before being acquired
by Meta. Meta's unique acqui-hire offered full NAV liquidity to LPs
without governance rights over portfolio companies. The deal reflects
a shift as investors prioritize direct involvement in AI development
over traditional venture returns. 

 RECAP OF GOOGLE'S AI UPDATES IN JUNE (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google had 14 major AI announcements last month, spanning from new
Gemini 2.5 models and voice conversations in Search to AlphaGenome for
DNA research and weather prediction tools. 

 PALMER LUCKEY, BACKED BY PALANTIR'S LONSDALE, TO LAUNCH
CRYPTO-FOCUSED BANK (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Palmer Luckey, supported by Joe Lonsdale, is launching Erebor, a new
crypto-focused bank, to fill the gap left by Silicon Valley Bank's
collapse. Erebor is seeking a national bank charter and plans to offer
services to tech sectors, including AI and crypto, using a
digital-only model. The bank, which aims to be the most regulated
entity in this sphere, will integrate stablecoins for fast
transactions.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW THE SMARTEST FOUNDERS ARE ALREADY WINNING WITH AI (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 AI tools are outperforming human creators and changing business
landscapes by offering superhuman advisory capabilities and reduced
judgment anxiety for users. Traditional software interfaces and roles
are becoming obsolete as rapid AI-driven product creation reshapes
industry dynamics. Embracing AI as a collaborator enables success,
while ignorance leads to irrelevance amidst this significant economic
shift. 

 AI, SEO, AND HOW TO SIMPLIFY YOUR CONTENT STRATEGY (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Apple's Eddy Cue just testified that search volume dropped for the
first time in 22 years because people are using ChatGPT instead.
Google's stock crashed 7%, wiping out $100 billion. However, here's
what everyone's missing: when people ask AI tools buying questions,
they're asking the same high-intent queries that drive SEO. "What is
the best CRM software?" works the same whether you type it into Google
or ChatGPT. Instead of panicking about AI killing search, just answer
the questions your sales calls reveal customers actually ask. 

 GETTING YOUR FIRST AES OFF THE GROUND (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Hiring your first AEs before you have a pipeline is like buying a
race car without building a track. Founders must prove outbound works
themselves first. The biggest mistake is that founders outsource their
target account list too early. Your new AEs see logos, you see
patterns from dozens of customer calls. Build the list yourself,
automate the outreach so AEs start with full calendars, then get out
of their way. Their only job is closing deals, not fixing your CRM.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BUNDLED OUT OF BUSINESS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google just killed a $425 million company by making its product free.
Marin Software spent 7 years building the perfect dashboard to manage
ads across Google, Facebook, and Yahoo - agencies loved it, and it
IPO'd in 2013. Then Google improved Ads Editor and Facebook launched
Business Manager, both free. Marin's revenue peaked in 2015 and slid
every year until this week's bankruptcy. 

 IS THE "CONVICTION" GAME IN VC BS? (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Carta ran 20,000 simulations comparing two VC strategies and found
something VCs don't want to hear. A "spray and pray" fund with 100
investments beats a "conviction" fund with 20 investments almost every
time - 2.6x returns vs 2.1x, and 99.7% chance of not losing money vs
81.9%. Only the top 5% of funds do better with conviction. Yet VCs
still concentrate because LPs love the story of genius stock-picking.
The math says most VCs would do better admitting they can't predict
winners and making more bets. 

 HOW TO MEASURE AI IMPACT IN ENGINEERING TEAMS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The phrase, "AI improves developer productivity by 100x," is
meaningless hype without data. Most engineering leaders report 0.3-1x
actual improvement. DX's framework measures what matters - not just if
developers accept AI suggestions, but whether that code makes it to
production. Track three dimensions that follow the AI adoption
lifecycle: First, utilization (are people using it?), then impact (is
it actually helping?), and finally, cost (is the ROI positive?). Most
importantly, measure AI agents as part of the team overseeing them,
not as standalone contributors.
