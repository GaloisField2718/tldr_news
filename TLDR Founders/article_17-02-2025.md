HEADLINES & TRENDS

 BUILDING MIGHTY SMALL BUSINESSES (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This piece revisits the ideal of building a self-sustaining company
that doesn't rely on ever-larger fundraises or venture-style
hypergrowth. The author points out how overshooting with massive
valuations and huge spending can leave a business broken, with the
majority of founders missing out on a meaningful exit. Instead, the
article celebrates modest but mighty businesses—some profitable with
a handful of employees, others generating millions in revenue and
growing steadily. It frames this approach as more closely aligned with
personal freedom and the classic American dream of running your own
shop, rather than chasing unicorn status and risking everything. 

 LESSONS FROM FASTLY (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Fastly once commanded top-tier multiples but has plummeted from
grace—down over 90% from its peak. This article diagnoses the drop
by pointing to stubbornly low gross margins, negative free cash flow,
and a collapsing net retention rate. Cultural red flags include poor
Glassdoor reviews, suggesting deeper operational issues that hamper
its turnaround. The broader lesson is that a high growth story can
prop up a weak economic model only for so long; eventually, genuine
profit potential and operational health have to shine through. 

 IT'S TIME FOR EUROPE TO STAND UP (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In a climate where U.S. leadership sends ambiguous signals, the
message is clear that Europe can't rely on American defense the way it
once did. Europe faces threats from Russia and must bolster its own
security, economy, and cohesion. That means bigger defense budgets,
integrated military strategy, and revitalizing industries. Even if
U.S. rhetoric is politically charged, the author argues Europe's best
route is to unify, rebuild manufacturing, and secure its own stability
rather than waiting for Washington to come to the rescue.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO SELECT YOUR FIRST MARKETING CHANNEL (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Your best starting channel lives at the intersection of two
constraints: where your potential customers already congregate and
what sort of marketing comes naturally to you. Instead of forcing
yourself onto a platform you don't understand—and risking bland,
insincere messaging—pick a medium you genuinely enjoy so you can
stand out. It's often more productive to be the number-three voice on
a smaller channel than the two-hundredth on a larger one. If your main
channel conflicts with your skills, partner with someone who excels at
it while you focus on your strengths. 

 MAKING SENSE OF REVENUE METRICS FOR FUNDRAISING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This breakdown clarifies how to categorize and present your numbers
when you have a blend of annual contracts, monthly contracts, and
transaction fees. Key metrics like CARR (Contracted ARR), live ARR,
and trailing-3-month transaction revenue all matter. Keep your
reporting straightforward and honest—don't fold unpredictable
transaction-based income into ARR, and don't hype proof-of-concepts as
if they're guaranteed renewals. Investors appreciate clarity on which
revenue is stable and which is volatile, so highlight each source
distinctly and show trends rather than a single snapshot. 

 YOUR B2B PRODUCT-LED MOTION IS MORE OF A DATA PROBLEM THAN A PRODUCT
PROBLEM (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most B2B teams talk about product-led growth as if it's just about
building a slick self-serve funnel, but this essay argues the real
pain point is data. Successful PLG needs end-to-end user metrics—who
signed up, what they did in-app, where they get stuck, and how usage
signals feed into your CRM—yet these data flows are often broken.
The authors recommend collecting user demographics, activation
funnels, and engagement triggers at the source, then piping them into
your CRM or marketing platform. They stress that picking one or two
key signals and getting them right beats half-implementing a dozen.

 WHEN EVERYONE CAN BUILD ANYTHING (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 As AI-driven coding becomes ubiquitous, design's role
adapts—quality, originality, and taste still matter. The piece urges
designers and engineers to embrace new AI tools while acknowledging
the tradeoff: more creative output can also mean more low-grade
clutter. The real winners will be those who bring human insight and
craft to an ecosystem where the cost of coding is near zero. 

 APPROACHING THE EVENT HORIZON (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI's latest breakthrough suggests we're nearing artificial
general intelligence through an algorithm that can scale reasoning
with compute power. The implications are profound: potentially half of
knowledge work could be automated. 

 CHANNEL COMES LAST, NOT FIRST (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Drawing from Louis Grenier's book on business positioning, the
article explains why understanding customer insights should precede
channel selection. Rather than starting with marketing tactics,
successful businesses first deeply understand customer struggles and
jobs-to-be-done.
