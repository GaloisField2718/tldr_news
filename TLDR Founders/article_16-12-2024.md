HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHAT IS A GREAT BUSINESS? (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A great business fulfills consumer preferences that competitors
can't, building goodwill and consumer surplus. The more preferences it
serves beyond what's necessary for a transaction, the more goodwill it
creates. Great businesses methodically build and release this
"pressure" through pricing, not mistakes. Management's role is to grow
goodwill while strategically monetizing it. Being a great business
doesn't guarantee being a great investment - the latter depends on the
investor's entry price and reinvestment opportunities. There's no
universal formula; understanding the principles is key. 

 BEAT AND NO RAISE? (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Despite flat estimates, software stocks saw a 6% median multiple
expansion and 9% returns in 2024. Several factors could drive further
multiple expansion in 2025: stabilizing macro conditions, AI revenue
potential, low rate risk, and policy tailwinds. The risk leans to the
upside, with more potential positives than negatives ahead. Software's
"reversion to the mean" could be the next big trade, though Big Tech
AI winners may still be underrated. Overall, it's an exciting time to
invest in tech.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DON'T REINVENT USER PROFILING DURING ONBOARDING. THIS IS WHAT IT
SHOULD LOOK LIKE (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 First-party data on user demographics and firmographics is crucial
for personalizing experiences and analyzing the right segments.
Collect it directly from users in onboarding with a 3-step flow: 1)
About the user 2) About their company 3) Invite team members. Ask
multiple-choice questions on intent, role, seniority, and use cases.
Show the team invite to everyone, setting the admin as default. Then
ask about their goals to broaden their perspective. Keep it simple,
use logic, and only ask what you'll use. A 15% drop-off is worth the
data. 

 INTEL'S DEATH AND POTENTIAL REVIVAL (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In the 1980s, IBM's decision to outsource the DOS operating system to
Microsoft and hardware to Intel laid the foundation for the dominance
of both companies. However, the rise of mobile technology, signaled by
Apple's iPhone launch in 2007, shifted the focus to efficiency,
breaking Microsoft's and Intel's long-standing hold on the market as
ARM and RISC architectures took precedence. Intel missed critical
opportunities in the mobile space and is now facing challenges
competing against TSMC's advanced manufacturing capabilities, with
calls for U.S. government intervention to support Intel's foundry
capabilities as a matter of national security.

 MANAGE THE HOW, NOT THE WHAT (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A lot of founders jump into the role of manager without much
practice. We maintain a high bar for quality, and when things don't
meet that bar, we often have the urge to just do that thing ourselves.
This post provides some keen insights on how to provide the right
frameworks for your employees by being super clear on the desired
outcome, and less clear on the path to get there.
