HEADLINES & TRENDS

 INFLATION IS COMING DOWN & FED NEEDS TO ACT (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 March inflation dropped to 2.4% with core CPI falling below 3% for
the first time since 2021, signaling that disinflation is real and
accelerating quickly. The current administration is averaging just
1.0% inflation - a welcome shift after five brutal years when
necessities like food (27.5%), electricity (34.2%), and auto insurance
(53.7%) saw massive price increases. The Fed should cut rates soon to
prevent an economic slowdown. 

 HOW I SPENT 17,784 HOURS IN 5 YEARS AS A STARTUP FOUNDER (21 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Sam Corcos, founder of Levels, offers insights into time management
and company evolution, challenging assumptions about burnout and team
management. Over five years, his tracking reveals surprises, such as
the consistent time spent on management despite scaling and the
rejuvenation of engineering by eliminating excess management layers.
Corcos emphasizes strategic thinking through quarterly "Think Weeks"
and ongoing investor relations, adapting to personal life changes
without sacrificing productivity. 

 HOW MONTE CARLO REINVENTED THEIR BUSINESS WITH DAILY REVENUE (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Barr Moses, CEO of Monte Carlo, discusses transitioning from ARR to
daily revenue as a core metric. The session covers Monte Carlo's
pricing model evolution, organizational alignment, and lessons
learned. It aims to guide founders on building scalable, value-aligned
pricing systems.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO BUILD A SCALED EXPERIMENTATION ENGINE (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Companies like OpenAI and Notion test almost everything they ship,
moving beyond basic A/B testing to full experimentation engines. This
approach rests on three pillars: trustworthy experiments that handle
outliers and account for initial excitement around new features,
strong institutional memory so teams don't repeat tests others have
already done, and a data culture where everyone uses the same metrics
and values truth over looking good. To build this in your company,
avoid common mistakes like checking results too early or ignoring
negative impacts on important customer segments, and focus on making
it easy for teams to document and share what they learn across the
organization. 

 FROM ZERO TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS: LESSONS IN COURAGEOUS MARKETING (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In his new book "Courageous Marketing," former Gong CMO Udi Ledergor
reveals how taking calculated risks helped transform a 12-customer
startup into a billion-dollar company. His counterintuitive thesis:
the safest strategy is often the riskiest because blending in means
death in crowded markets. Gong's success came from tactical genius -
like buying 15-second regional Super Bowl ads instead of $5M national
spots, purchasing small West Coast newspaper ads and amplifying them
on social media, and creating a memorable visual identity with bright
colors and a bulldog mascot. 

 THE OVERFUNDING TRAP: WHY RAISING MORE THAN YOU NEED CAN HARM YOUR
STARTUP (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Overvaluations remain an issue in venture capital, particularly
impacting startups during downturns, as seen with AI startups now
echoing 2021's patterns. Inflated valuations lead to challenges like
increased dilution and difficulties in securing follow-on funding.
Founders are advised to raise only necessary funds, prioritize capital
efficiency, and be open to valuation resets to ensure sustainable
growth.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EVERY MARKETING CHANNEL SUCKS RIGHT NOW (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 All major marketing channels have become expensive, slow, or
ineffective - SEO takes too long, influencer marketing doesn't
convert, ads get more expensive daily, and viral loops require an
already-great product. This is the inevitable outcome of the "Law of
Shitty Clickthroughs" where channels decay as competition increases
and consumer engagement drops. The solution isn't chasing these "Big
Channels" but focusing on "Little Channels" that don't scale:
organizing mini-events, targeting specific communities, or leveraging
personal networks. 

 ISN'T EVERY INVESTOR DATA-DRIVEN? (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Most VCs think they're data-driven, but they see only the deals that
come to them (mostly founders reaching out), have time to collect just
a handful of data points per company, and then make gut calls based on
whatever similar companies they've personally seen before. True
data-driven investors use technology to dramatically expand their view
- they scrape the entire web to find every possible deal, gather
mountains of data on each company automatically, and analyze it all
with consistent algorithms instead of morning-coffee intuition. 

 MERCURY'S SERIES C (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Mercury has announced a $300 million Series C funding round led by
Sequoia Capital that values the company at $3.5 billion. It reported
ten consecutive profitable quarters, $500 million in annual revenue

innovation, acquisitions, and talent acquisition, further cementing

industries.
