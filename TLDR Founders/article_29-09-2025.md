HEADLINES & TRENDS

 TRUMP PAVES WAY FOR $14B TIKTOK DEAL THAT PUTS US INVESTORS IN THE
DRIVER'S SEAT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Trump just approved a TikTok deal where American investors, including
Oracle, Michael Dell, and Rupert Murdoch, will control 80% of a new US
entity valued at $14 billion, with ByteDance keeping 20%. The new
structure means the US company will control TikTok's algorithm and
content, technically complying with the 2024 law requiring ByteDance's
divestiture while keeping the app running. 

 YC EARLY DECISION FOR STUDENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 YC's Early Decision allows students to apply while in school,
securing a future spot in a batch post-graduation. Successful
applicants receive immediate funding, ensuring they can complete their
studies before starting with YC. 

 HUMANOID ROBOTS ARE META'S NEXT ‘AR-SIZE BET' (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta is investing heavily in humanoid robots, focusing on software
rather than hardware, according to CTO Andrew Bosworth. The company
plans to develop a licensing software platform for other
manufacturers, similar to Google's strategy in the mobile industry.
Meta's new Superintelligence AI lab aims to create a "world model" for
dexterous robotics, with key talent hired to lead this effort.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE RIGHT WAY TO PITCH VCS AND ACCELERATORS (AND WHY MOST FOUNDERS
GET IT WRONG) (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Venture capital funding is rising, with North American startups
securing $184 billion, yet competition remains intense. Investors seek
differentiation and scalability, and VCs require early market
validation, while accelerators focus on the founder's problem-solving
insights. Successful pitches emphasize clear, jargon-free
communication, a distinctive future vision, and proof of traction to
convert investors from skeptics to believers. 

 WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT BUILDING AI-POWERED FEATURES (4 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 PostHog founders waited until 2024 to add AI, seeing most features as
"fool's gold" - bolted on, rarely used, quick to tarnish. After a year
of building Max AI, the team shares three hard lessons learned. 

 EFFORT-OUTCOME ASYMMETRY (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Effort and outcomes often don't align. Cheaper celebrity podcasts now
out-earn costly narrative shows. Business degrees provide higher
starting salaries than counseling degrees, despite the same time
investment. Entrepreneurs should evaluate ideas and existing projects
to ensure efforts yield substantial returns, focusing on projects that
compound input effectively.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PERSONAL CONTEXT SEARCH IS THE REAL SEO APOCALYPSE (4 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Google will launch a personal context search that adds everything it
knows about you to queries. It would turn a search like "coffee" into
"oat milk latte near my 2 pm meeting that won't make me late"
automatically. This fragments SEO because profitable generic searches
are split into millions of hyper-specific queries nobody can optimize
for - sites dominating "best laptop" lose traffic to niche players
matching individual contexts. The shift means SEO moves from keywords
to being genuinely useful for specific moments, while Google's data
moat makes this advantage permanent. 

 THE ART OF PROTOTYPING (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Just because AI lets anyone spin up an app in minutes doesn't mean
they understand prototyping - real prototyping is about asking the
right questions, not just building things. The best prototypes are
disposable tools designed to answer one specific question: does this
solve a real problem (Role), does it feel right to use (Look and
Feel), or can we actually build it (Implementation)? Pick one lens,
build just enough to learn something, then throw it away. 

 WHY EXPERTS WRITING AI EVALS ARE CREATING THE FASTEST-GROWING
COMPANIES IN HISTORY (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Experts writing AI evaluations have transformed them into essential
sales tools and technical benchmarks for AI companies, driving rapid
growth. Mercor leveraged this opportunity and reached $500M revenue in
17 months by partnering with top AI labs to provide expert evaluations
that improve model performance. Brendan Foody, Mercor's CEO,
highlights the importance of evaluations in addressing AI bottlenecks
and shaping the future AI-driven economy.
