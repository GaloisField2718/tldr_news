HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE INDIE ERA OF STARTUPS (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 More founders are rejecting the VC route in favor of bootstrapping or
raising smaller amounts of capital from angels. Layoffs across tech
have injected a huge amount of Silicon Valley trained operators, who
are building their own profitable companies. The impact? More healthy
companies that don't chase the venture rabbit down the hole and have
an outsized impact on the makeup of our society. 

 THE FIVE PILLARS OF STARTUP IMPACT (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Increasing loneliness, rising healthcare and education costs, and
climbing C02 emissions paint a sobering story. There‚Äôs a lot to fix,
but startups will play a leading role in the solution. Startups that
tangibly make life better for all of us will attract young talent, and
the companies that can attract the best talent will define the next
generation of tech. 

 TECH PREDICTIONS FOR 2024 AND BEYOND (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Four predictions about how tech will evolve and impact the world
around us. Two directly involve AI, and the others declare how Femtech
and Edtech, which seemed to have been on a low boil for a decade, will
finally take off.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO GET A MEETING WITH AN INVESTOR (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Raising capital for your startup involves kissing a lot of frogs. Be
comfortable with rejection, reach out to more people than you think
you need to, keep cold outbounds short, and ensure you‚Äôre mindful of
how you present yourself. 

 5 INTERESTING LEARNINGS FROM FASTLY AT $500,000,000+ IN ARR (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Despite customer numbers remaining relatively flat, Fastly has
maintained a stable NRR of 114%, meaning the value of its existing
customers is growing YoY. Instead of accelerating product innovation,
it seems the company has opted to inch itself to profitability. 

 A GUIDE TO EARLY EMPLOYEE EQUITY (3 MINUTE READ) [10]

This thread presents eight essential factors to consider in
determining the appropriate amount of equity to offer to early
employees.

 ARE YOU LIMITING YOUR COMPANY‚ÄôS GROWTH AND SUCCESS? (2 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 As your company scales, the role you play as a founder evolves. Being
stubborn with that evolution can create bottlenecks. Here are some
behaviors a founder identified they were doing that ultimately
hindered growth at their $10m ARR SaaS company. 

 WHY YOU REALLY DO NEED A TECHNICAL CO-FOUNDER (15 MINUTE VIDEO) [15] 

 Who needs a technical co-founder with all the no-code tools and
incoming AI co-pilots, right? However, based on the thousands of
companies YC has funded over the years, companies lacking a technical
co-founder underperform. 

 WHY LEADERS FAIL AT GETTING ACTIONABLE FEEDBACK (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 As a leader, it can be really hard to solicit genuine feedback from
your employees. Success comes from how you package the request. You
need to be comfortable with discomfort and come to the table with the
right question set. Most importantly, take action on the feedback.

QUICK LINKS

 THE ART OF ESTIMATION (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 When quoting for a gig, or perhaps pricing your product for the first
time, we tend to undervalue the service we‚Äôre providing. We‚Äôre
sometimes insecure about our value and we don‚Äôt want to lose the
opportunity. Think holistically about how you position your price to
ensure you‚Äôre offering the best offer, not the cheapest. 

 TWO TITANS ON THE FUTURE OF AI (WITH REID HOFFMAN AND VINOD KHOSLA)
(4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A good recap of the 45+ minute talks between Reid Hoffman and Vinod
Khosla where they dive into a variety of topics, from AI to
‚Äútechno-optimist‚Äù manifestos. Both titans have great perspectives
on things to come and how the tech industry should be regulated (hint:
not at all). 

 DOES IT SEEM LIKE EVERYONE IN TECH IS UNHAPPIER? IT‚ÄôS NOT JUST YOU
(2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The short of it is that comp and work-life balance is better, but
tech workers are the unhappiest they have been since 2020. The shift
is moving to workers thinking of their jobs more as transactional in
nature.
