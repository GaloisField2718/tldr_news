HEADLINES & TRENDS

 IS THE IPO PROCESS A SCAM? (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma's stock popped 250% on IPO day - the highest since 1999. For
those who weren't following, this wasn't actually mispricing, but
artificial scarcity at work. Only 3% of shares were available to trade
because investment banks deliberately keep the float tiny. Long-term
investors got their allocation and held tight while traders scrambled
for the few shares available. Within days, the stock crashed 50% as
reality set in. Now it's easy to call IPOs a scam, but this is exactly
how the system is designed to work - banks manufacture these pops to
make headlines and reward their best clients with instant profits. 

 META ACQUIRES AI AUDIO STARTUP WAVEFORMS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta has acquired AI startup WaveForms, bolstering its AI unit,
Superintelligence Labs. Co-founders Alexis Conneau and Coralie
Lemaitre have joined Meta. WaveForms focused on the "Speech Turing
Test" and "Emotional General Intelligence." 

 CHATGPT IS BRINGING BACK 4O AS AN OPTION BECAUSE PEOPLE MISSED IT (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has reinstated GPT-4o as an option in ChatGPT following
backlash from users mourning its replacement with GPT-5. Users missed
GPT-4o's perceived personality and flexibility for various tasks.
OpenAI indicated that Plus users could choose between models. CEO Sam
Altman also stated OpenAI aims to address concerns over GPT-5's
performance and transparency.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO 'TEST' YOUR MESSAGING TO FIND MESSAGE-MARKET FIT (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Message-Market Fit means your ideal buyers immediately "get it". You
see high response rates on outbound, better click-through rates, and
prospects understand your value before you explain it. To test
properly, run 2-3 meaningfully different messaging angles across
channels you're already using, aim for at least 8-12 qualified leads
per variant over two weeks, then debrief with sales to see which
message got people talking with fewer objections - if one variant
improves conversion by 15%+, double down and bake it into all your GTM
assets. 

 MILLIONS IN REVENUE WITH A <15 PERSON TEAM (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most startups die because they build what they think customers want,
not what customers actually need. Vitalize Care's founders slept in
hospitals for eight months watching nurses work - and discovered their
mental health app was solving the wrong problem. Nurses didn't need
therapy, they needed someone to fix their staffing nightmare. After
throwing out their entire product and selling hospitals on Figma
mockups, they hit millions in ARR with just 15 people. Now, every
engineer flies to hospitals monthly because that extreme customer
proximity is their superpower. 

 SHOULD WE OFFER PILOTS? (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A Chief Procurement Officer insists that not offering pilots is a
"major red flag." However, the best sales teams do something
counterintuitive - they default to no pilots and make buyers pay to
prove they're serious. If you must offer one, take a page from CJ
Edmonds at Conversion Logix, who structures pilots with continuation
clauses that auto-convert to paid contracts unless cancelled within
120 days. Most buyers requesting pilots aren't actually testing
functionality - they're testing whether you're enterprise-grade. So if
you must offer one, define success metrics upfront, charge for it, and
remember that pilots should be your last resort.

 THE PRIVATE MARKET TRAP (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Money is flowing into private companies but can't get out - there's
$13 trillion trapped. You should care because startups convince people
to work for less money by giving them stock. That deal only makes
sense if the stock can turn into cash someday. No IPOs means that
stock is just paper, which means talented people may be less inclined
to join startups. 

 EUROPE'S GREAT FOUNDERS MUST UNRETIRE (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 European entrepreneurs tend to retire early, missing potential
decades of innovation and productivity. This contrasts with the US,
where cultural norms push founders to create continually, contributing
significantly to technological advancements. Europe must encourage its
most successful entrepreneurs to keep building, or it risks falling
behind the US and China in technology and innovation. 

 HOW DEBT TO EBITDA RATIOS ARE IMPACTING DEALS IN 2025 (8 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Everyone obsesses over valuation multiples, but the metric that
actually controls private equity deals is simpler: how much debt you
can pile on. In 2021, PE firms were loading companies with 7.5x EBITDA
in debt, and someone would always fund it. Today, you're lucky to get
5x, and junior debt has essentially vanished. The entire PE model
depends on leverage to juice returns - when debt dries up, so do the
deals. That's why take-privates of companies like PagerDuty and Olo
are suddenly everywhere. With rates high and lenders spooked, PE firms
can only make the math work on deeply discounted public companies.
