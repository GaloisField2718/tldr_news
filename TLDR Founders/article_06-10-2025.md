HEADLINES & TRENDS

 VENTURE CAPITAL'S CAUTIOUS REAWAKENING (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 VCs are taking more discovery meetings, but the bar is higher than
ever - they want founders with real operating experience after getting
burned by younger teams who couldn't execute. AI companies are growing
2-5x faster than historical SaaS peers and command an 85% valuation
premium, but investors are warning founders not to over-raise or hire
ahead of milestones. 

 NAVEEN RAO'S NEW AI HARDWARE STARTUP TARGETS $5B VALUATION WITH
BACKING FROM A16Z, SOURCES SAY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Naveen Rao's new startup, Unconventional, Inc., aims to raise $1
billion at a $5 billion valuation to develop a novel computer system
with brain-like efficiency. Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed, Lux
Capital, and Databricks are backing the venture, which plans to
compete with Nvidia by designing custom AI hardware. Rao, a former AI
leader at Databricks, has a successful track record with previous
startups like MosaicML and Nervana Systems. 

 WITH ITS LATEST ACQUI-HIRE, OPENAI IS DOUBLING DOWN ON PERSONALIZED
CONSUMER AI (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI acquired Roi, an AI-powered personal finance app. CEO Sujith
Vishwajith will be the only team member joining OpenAI. This move
continues OpenAI's trend of acqui-hires targeting
personalization-focused technology, enhancing its consumer
applications like Pulse and Sora. The acquisition supports OpenAI's
strategy to develop adaptive AI products and boost revenue from
consumer apps.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW YOU.COM SURVIVED CHATGPT WITH A PIVOT TO ENTERPRISE AI (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 You.com shifted from consumer search to enterprise AI, offering
search APIs and complex data analytics to businesses following
ChatGPT's launch. Competing with Google and others in the AI market,
You.com leverages its own search infrastructure to deliver detailed
reports and agent-based solutions like business analytics and
financial analysis. The company also introduced Auto Mode for
integrating multiple LLMs. It has secured $100M in VC funding to
expand its agent-centric services. 

 BASE, BEST, WORST: YOUR 2026 PLANNING FRAMEWORK (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Building one annual plan forces founders to pretend everything goes
perfectly - sales hit quota, marketing scales efficiently, and nobody
quits. Instead, build three parallel plans with different growth
targets and burn rates. Your base case uses actual historical data.
Best case adds upside from partnerships or new products. Worst-case
accounts for churn spikes or funding delays. The power is in
pre-agreeing what triggers each scenario - if you hit X revenue in Q2,
unlock Y hires. If conversion misses for two quarters, cut Z budget.
Bring GTM leadership together to pressure test the assumptions before
finalizing, then share one plan with the company, but review all three
with the board quarterly. 

 ALPHA IN THE AGE OF AGREEMENT (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Seed and Series A valuations are soaring, often starting at $100M
pre-money, with investment decisions happening in mere hours. VCs are
prioritizing big follow-on rounds and targeting AI applications,
driving uniformity in investment strategies. The challenge is
generating alpha by balancing short-term contrarianism with long-term
insights in an overwhelmingly consensus-driven market.

MISCELLANEOUS

 996 IS NOT YOUR COMPETITION (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The 996 crowd posts their suffering like medals, screenshotting their
commits and counting their hours - they're performing intensity to
avoid asking if they even care. You can't beat someone who thinks
they're playing. When you genuinely love what you're building, hours
disappear, and you're not counting because you're playing. Your 0.1%
equity is probably worthless, and the expected value is less than
staying at Google, but the math was never the point - the joy is.
Intensity without belief just leads to burnout, that weight you feel
every Sunday night. 

 LANGUAGE AGNOSTIC PROGRAMMING: WHY YOU MAY STILL NEED CODE (4 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 People claim English will replace programming languages entirely, but
developers aren't buying it. Even if AI writes all your code, someone
still has to debug it when things break, and natural language is too
ambiguous for that. What if AI let you read code in whatever language
you want, regardless of what it's written in? The codebase is written
in Rust, but you debug in Python while your teammate reads it as
TypeScript, with AI handling translation. This could kill the eternal
problem of onboarding engineers who don't know your stack, though it
requires AI fast enough to feel instant. 

 THE JOY OF SMALL MARKETS (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Small markets can offer a more stable path to wealth compared to
large ones due to "relative scale" advantages. Being a dominant player
in a small market allows a company to sustain steady earnings that
aren't threatened by smaller or larger competitors. Large companies
often see these markets as too costly and small to enter, making them
less competitive and more lucrative for those within.

 SAYING LESS (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Telling people your plans before executing them creates a false sense
of accomplishment that makes follow-through less likely - you get the
social reward without doing the work.
