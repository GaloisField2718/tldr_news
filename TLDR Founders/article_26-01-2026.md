 SOLVE ENTERPRISE AUTH, IDENTITY, AND SECURITY FOR YOUR APP (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Enterprise customers demand SSO, Directory Sync, RBAC, and Audit
Logs, but building and maintaining that infrastructure slows teams
down and pulls focus from core product work.

WorkOS [4] provides these features through simple APIs and a hosted
Admin Portal that integrates with every identity provider. You get
production-ready enterprise capabilities without owning the complexity
yourself. 

Trusted by OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Vercel, and 1000+ more. Your
first million MAUs are free.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE HAMSTER WHEEL HAS ENGINEERS (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Some products will eventually mature to the point where
forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are no longer required. Others,
particularly in AI, might have FDEs permanently as a feature. Products
where value comes from applying judgment, recognizing patterns, and
doing things that can't be reduced to a configuration screen may
require human expertise to be part of the product forever. 

 THE YEAR OF MULTI-MODAL (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Text was the fastest path to usefulness for AI, but it was always a
middle state. Humans don't experience the world in text. Work doesn't
happen in text. What's changing now is that multi-modal models are
good enough, inference costs are low enough for always-on perception,
and cameras, microphones, and sensors are making the physical world
legible to machines. Once AI can see, hear, and react continuously,
text-only AI will feel as constrained as desktop-only software felt
once mobile took over. 

 WILL AI KILL FINTECH SAAS? (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI advancements challenge Fintech SaaS by enabling rapid,
cost-effective software development. However, real value remains in
data, regulatory relationships, and handling complex edge cases at
scale—categories agents can't easily replicate. Fintech companies
with strong data moats and network effects will thrive, but must adapt
quickly to maintain their competitive edge.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 STRIPE'S LIGHTHOUSE HIRING PATTERN (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lighthouse Hiring is the idea that hiring well-connected people makes
subsequent hires both easier and higher quality. Spending the extra
time to land one 'lighthouse hire' can improve the quality and
velocity of any hiring push. Not all of these people will be
well-known - they are just widely-connected. This strategy isn't
without its downside - it takes some nuance to deploy effectively. 

 BREX AND THE PROS AND CONS OF HUBRISTIC FUNDRAISING (18 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Hubristic fundraising is where companies raise so aggressively that
they are essentially betting the entire future of the company on
hitting an extraordinary outcome. These deals attract the best talent
and capital, create customer and partner gravity, generate relentless
press coverage, and demoralize competitors, but the talent is usually
mercenary, any stumble becomes a 'failure', decision-making is warped,
and the bar for success becomes close to impossible. The Age of AI is
seeing hubristic fundraising return at a scale that makes 2021 look
quaint.

 HOW TO BUILD A STARTUP PEOPLE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT (8 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The next era of tech brands that will win will be the ones that
become something akin to a lifestyle brand. They will stand for
something clear, and that something will show up everywhere. Tech has
historically been bad at this, but it is now integrated deeply in
people's lives, and the market and user demand have grown. People will
soon associate themselves with tech brands as they do with brands like
Nike. Soon, brands will do more of the work than the products
themselves. 

 IT'S TIME TO START YOUR CONTENT CREATOR ERA (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Personal audiences are becoming a crucial distribution channel for
companies. A following proves agency and an understanding of the
latest growth tactics. Acquiring and engaging an audience has a lot in
common with acquiring and engaging users and customers. Content
creator skills translate a lot to quality marketing and growth. Hiring
someone with a big audience is practically bringing in a new
distribution channel.
