HEADLINES & TRENDS

 HYPE DEFLATION & INFLATION: THE ENDLESS EBB AND FLOW (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 This article discusses the cyclical nature of hype in technology,
illustrating how various tech sectors like VR, AI, and crypto
experience peaks of inflated expectations and troughs of
disillusionment, yet true innovation and conviction persist through
these cycles. It emphasizes the importance of genuine belief in
technology's potential over the temporary allure of hype, using
examples of individuals and companies who remained committed to their
visions despite fluctuating public interest. 

 THE GOLDEN AGE OF DEEP TECH (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 It's time to build in deep tech. This article challenges the
misconception that deep tech startups, such as those in robotics,
space, and biotech, are overly capital-intensive and difficult to
succeed in, arguing that advancements in technology, increased access
to venture capital, and a richer talent pool have made these ventures
more feasible and less costly than in the past. It highlights the
significant reduction in costs for essential tech components, the
availability of non-dilutive funding, and global macroeconomic
tailwinds as key factors enabling the rapid development and growth of
deep tech companies, suggesting an optimistic future for startups in
these fields. 

 WHAT MAKES FOR SUCCESSFUL CONSUMER FOUNDERS? (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This research analyzes the characteristics and backgrounds of
founders at the helm of consumer unicorns, challenging conventional
wisdom about what makes a successful consumer founder. Key findings
include that most successful startups have an average of 2.2
cofounders with 7-9 years of experience, are headquartered in
California or New York, and often have at least one repeat founder.
Engineering expertise is less critical than commonly believed.

models with the broad accessibility of freemium plans, reverse trials
could significantly boost user acquisition, engagement, and
conversion.

reconnecting with people, attending events, traveling, and taking on
new projects. These can help slow down the perceived passage of time

memories.
