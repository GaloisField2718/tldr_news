 BOTS ABUSE FREE TRIALS. WORKOS RADAR STOPS THEM. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Free trials help AI apps grow, but bots and fake accounts exploit
them. They steal tokens, burn compute, and disrupt real users.

Cursor, the fast-growing AI code assistant, uses WorkOS Radar [5] to
detect and stop abuse in real time. With device fingerprinting and
behavioral signals, Radar blocks fraud before it reaches your app.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 RAMP AT $1 BILLION (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Every article about Ramp starts with the same question: Can it really
keep growing this fast? It was doubling at $100 million, doubling at
$500 million, and somehow still doubling at $1 billion in revenue, all
while being cash flow positive. This piece digs into why its growth
hasn't hit the wall everyone expects. 

 SIGNS OF LIFE IN UNICORN-LAND (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The unicorn market has split into rockets and zombies, with no middle
ground left. Out of 1,609 unicorns worth $6.2 trillion, winners like
Databricks ($100 billion valuation, 50% growth) and Supabase (jumping
from $900 million to $5 billion) are staying private to keep the
spoils for themselves, while 28% aren't growing at all and over half
fail basic financial health checks. The best companies are avoiding
IPOs because they're growing so fast they don't need public money,
while the zombies have nowhere to go but down. 

 COGNITION RAISES $400M AT $10.2B VALUATION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cognition raised $400M at a $10.2B valuation in a funding round led
by Founders Fund, with contributions from existing and new investors.
The company's acquisition of Windsurf significantly boosted its ARR
and product offerings in AI coding. The merger accelerated growth,
positioning Cognition as a leader in AI-powered engineering solutions
for top-tier customers like Goldman Sachs and Dell.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SNAP BREAKS INTO 'STARTUP SQUADS' AS AD REVENUE STALLS (1 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Snap has restructured into "startup squads" of 10 to 15 people to
address stalled ad revenue and user decline. Snapchat+ subscriptions
generate over $700 million annually, marking a significant direct
revenue source. Snap is also developing AR glasses, aiming to
revolutionize human-centered computing. 

 BOOTSTRAPPING VS FUNDRAISING (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Bootstrapping allows founders to maintain control and minimize equity
dilution using personal funds, but it poses financial risks and may
limit growth. Raising venture capital provides cash, expertise, and
validation but involves equity dilution and loss of control. With a
hybrid approach, companies can bootstrap initially to prove their
concept, then seek external capital for accelerated growth. 

 996 IS REAL, AND IT'S BECOMING COMMON (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ramp's data shows the "996" workweek, a 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
six-day-a-week schedule, is becoming prevalent in San Francisco,
affecting multiple sectors beyond just tech. This shift creates
intense competition, demanding faster product development and
heightened responsiveness, especially for B2B companies. Leaders must
decide whether to adopt 996, focus on efficiency, target different
markets, or innovate hybrid models to maintain a competitive edge.

 WHY RETENTION IS SO HARD FOR NEW TECH PRODUCTS (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 You might think fixing retention at a startup works like it does at
big companies - run A/B tests, optimize onboarding, and send more
notifications. However, that's attacking the wrong problem entirely.
The truth is that bad retention means you built something people don't
want, and no amount of optimization changes that. If your day-one
retention is 10% instead of 40%, you need a complete pivot - redesign
the home screen, change the core loop, and target different users. The
only path to good retention is building something people already need
to use frequently, then making it genuinely better than what exists. 

 USAGE BASED MODELS: WHY THEY SUCK AS A CUSTOMER (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Software companies sold us on usage-based pricing with a simple
promise - pay only for what you use. In practice, you buy a year's
worth of cloud credits for $100,000, use only $50,000, then discover
those unused credits disappear unless you spend another $100,000 next
year. One founder called it "infrastructure hostage-taking" after
going through exactly this. You ask to pay less since you're using
less, they say no, and your unused credits become leverage for them to
force a renewal. 

 AVEN RAISES $110M SERIES E TO EXPAND HOMEOWNER CREDIT PLATFORM (3
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Aven secured a $110M Series E round at a $2.2B valuation to cut
consumer credit costs, focusing initially on HELOC-backed credit
cards. It has saved customers over $215M in interest and expanded
credit lines to $3B. Aven plans to scale mortgage refinancing to
provide a comprehensive financial platform for American homeowners.
