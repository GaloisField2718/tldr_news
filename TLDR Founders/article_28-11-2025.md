HEADLINES & TRENDS

 NARRATIVE POWER IN THE AI ERA (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI's narrative and technological advancements are tightly linked,
with recent shifts from focusing on AGI to superintelligence reshaping
industry goals. Companies like OpenAI and Meta are harnessing these
narratives to drive capital investment and recruit top talent,
illustrating how storytelling influences technological development and
economic momentum. This evolving narrative reflects AI's ongoing
progress, as recent breakthroughs demand a new frontier beyond
human-level capabilities. 

 OUR 20+ AI AGENTS AND THEIR MOATS: REAL BUT WEAK (11 MINUTE READ) [6]


 The differentiation between AI agents is fairly narrow. While there
are some differences between UX, integrations, features, and
infrastructure, the core AI is basically the same everywhere. It's
possible to copy from one system to another and get almost the same
result. Companies need to consider what is actually defensible. 

 NOTES FROM AN INTERVIEW WITH JONY IVE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Jony Ive emphasizes care in design, valuing attention to detail even
in trivial aspects like packaging to convey thoughtfulness to users.
He believes products reflect interpersonal relationships within teams,
underscoring the importance of a supportive work environment. Ive also
values designing in personal spaces, arguing it influences creative
thinking differently than traditional conference rooms.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EAT PAIN, EXCRETE PRODUCT: THE FDE PLAYBOOK (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The technology vendors that win are the ones who figure out how to
make the technology actually work in the messy reality of enterprise
operations. Forward Deployed Engineering takes engineers who are
experts in the core technology and embeds them directly with industry
experts. They help build solutions that work for a specific context,
then extract the generalizable pieces that can be reused across
similar problems. Always build towards something reusable. 

 GOING TO MARKET WHEN NO MARKET EXISTS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Building a new category requires ignoring almost all standard
business advice. Since nobody knows they have a problem yet, your
product technically has zero value. This lures founders into a fatal
pricing mistake. They lower the price to get traction, but this
actually destroys the business model. You cannot sell a new idea
without an expensive sales team, and a low price makes that team
impossible to afford.

MISCELLANEOUS

 192 WEEKS (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 After leaving a pivotal role at Modal, a startup that grew to a $1
billion valuation, this engineer reflects on the journey from college
to the tech industry. Modal offered opportunities to build complex
systems, navigate social dynamics within a growing team, and
contribute significantly to the codebase. Looking forward, the
engineer plans to pursue new challenges while maintaining a focus on
innovative system development and meaningful connections. 

 HOW STARTUPS LOSE THEIR EDGE (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In football, "prevent defense" is a strategy used to protect a lead.
It usually backfires. This same mindset kills startups. When an IPO
gets close, founders often stop playing to win and start playing
"safe." They hire people with impressive resumes who dilute the
culture and turn product building into a committee process. The moment
you stop doing the weird, risky things that got you traction is the
moment you cap your outcome.
