HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE LNO FRAMEWORK (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The LNO Framework is a way to categorize your tasks into three
buckets—Leverage (L), Necessary (N), and Optional (O)—to ensure
you use your limited energy on the things that truly move the needle.
Leverage tasks (L) are the high-impact work that directly advances
your product or strategic objectives. Necessary tasks (N) are routine
responsibilities you can't ignore—like approvals or
maintenance—but don't spark huge outcomes. Optional tasks (O) are
the ones you can drop without significant consequences. 

 WHEN IS A MARKET TOO SMALL FOR VCS? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 “Too small a market” from a VC's mouth doesn't mean your startup
is worthless. It means it's not big enough to yield the 10-100x
returns they need. Venture math demands massive exits to power their
portfolios, so a $500M outcome might be too small for some big funds.
Thus, the lesson: find investors aligned with your realistic exit
potential. If you're not aiming for multi-billion scale, micro-VCs or
angels might fit you better rather than chasing top-tier funds that
pass due to market size constraints. 

 TOGETHER AI ANNOUNCES $305M SERIES B (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Together AI has announced a $305 million Series B funding round led
by General Catalyst and Prosperity7, with participation from investors
like NVIDIA and Salesforce Ventures. This investment will enhance
Together AI's position as a leader in AI Cloud solutions, with a focus
on supporting open-source AI models and NVIDIA Blackwell GPU
deployment.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NON-OBVIOUS SEO ADVICE FOR STARTUPS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 For early-stage software startups, it's easy to get stuck following
surface-level SEO tips, but truly effective SEO means doing a few less
obvious but powerful things: first, be defensive by creating content
about direct comparisons and integrations so potential customers find
your page instead of a competitor's. Second, focus on low-volume,
high-intent keywords (like “Electron analytics”) that match
specific user needs—hundreds of these niche terms add up quickly.
Third, Google is largely “looking at the people,” i.e., user
behavior, not just your content, so do everything possible to ensure
visitors stay on your pages and like what they see. 

 HOW TO TELL A CONSISTENT STORY (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article introduces a framework: “perceptions,” a set of
big-picture themes that unify your brand's narrative. Once defined—3
to 5 of them—use them to guide all campaigns and content so
everything aligns. This process prevents random, disjointed marketing.
It's practical because if your brand story is fuzzy or scattered, your
audience tunes out. With perceptions as your North Star, you can
quickly evaluate ideas for consistency, ensuring your marketing feels
cohesive across channels. 

 GETTING PRESS FOR YOUR STARTUP (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Cold-emailing journalists seldom works. They're bombarded by PR
blasts all day. Instead, build relationships well before you need
coverage: follow them, share their articles, and become a helpful
source. Then pitch a real story that benefits their readers. It's
crucial because real press coverage can spark new users, partners, and
even investors, but only if you're delivering something truly
newsworthy. By approaching it as a long-term game, you avoid that
typical “spray and pray” approach that yields nothing.

 6 HARD-WON LESSONS FROM SELLING MY STARTUP (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A founder recounts the months-long grind to a 9-figure acquisition.
The biggest takeaways: companies are “bought, not sold,” so keep
building until you have leverage. Lawyers can drag things out for
bigger fees, so it helps to push for a quick close. Also, watch out
for how your employees fare in deal negotiations. Many founders dream
of that big exit but are unprepared for the emotional whiplash,
endless legal slog, and potential heartbreak. This piece highlights
how to keep your company strong (and less distracted) until the wire
hits.

 WHERE WILL THE AI HORDE STRIKE NEXT? (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI disruption isn't one big invasion; it's a wave of startups
simultaneously probing every market niche, from Hollywood to social
media. Legacy players can't just defend one fortress; there's always
another angle for AI founders. AI's expansion is like a roving horde
of nimble companies. You either partner up or risk being
overrun—because the AI horde can adapt, pivot, and push wherever it
sees weakness.
