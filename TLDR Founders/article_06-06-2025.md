HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHAT IT TAKES TO IPO IN 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Monday.com's CFO joined just 4 months before its 2021 IPO with zero
public company experience, yet helped guide it to become one of only 9
cloud companies still above their IPO price. With IPO markets
reopening but demanding $500M+ ARR for $5B valuations, today's bar is
higher than ever. Success means telling your story well to build
credibility, being a strategic partner rather than a budget
gatekeeper, and using data to plan 24-48 months ahead. 

 DEFENSE TECH UNICORN ANDURIL POWERS UP WITH $2.5B AT $30.5B VALUATION
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anduril Industries raised $2.5 billion in Series G funding, doubling
its valuation to $30.5 billion. Founders Fund led the round,
contributing $1 billion. The funding positions Anduril to address
manufacturing and production challenges as it continues to expand.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LEADERS, STOP ACCIDENTALLY SCARING YOUR TEAM (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 When you say something negative won't happen, people still picture
the negative thing. A CEO tried to reassure employees by saying no one
would get laid off that day - and everyone immediately got worried.
Leaders often create fear by accident when trying to address concerns.
Instead of saying what won't go wrong, focus on what's going right. 

 YEARS OF EVIDENCE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 "Years of experience" is a terrible hiring standard. Someone can do
something for years and have nothing to show for it. Look for "years
of evidence" instead - people with deep examples of work, piles of
stuff they've made, collections of output they're proud to share.
Someone new to their career might have little formal experience, but
if they've been loving this work for a long time, they likely have
hobby projects or examples they can't wait to show off. Titles and
tenure don't matter. The work does. 

 DOES AI THREATEN VERTICAL SAAS? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The "AI will kill vertical software" prediction started with David
Friedberg on the All In podcast. He saw an engineer at his company
replicate a $50k supply chain tool and figured this would happen
everywhere. However, this misses the point - it's easy to build simple
tools in a vacuum, but real products have way more defensibility.
Maybe this just shows which types of SaaS are actually at risk: narrow
tools that are easy to copy, services AI can do better, and old
companies that don't adapt.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AI IS HERE FOR PLUMBERS AND ELECTRICIANS. WILL IT TRANSFORM HOME
SERVICES? (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 San Francisco startup Netic raised $20M to bring AI appointment
booking, customer outreach, and sales optimization to home-services
businesses. Its generative AI platform predicts service needs,
prioritizes incoming jobs, and integrates with trade management
software to boost technician efficiency. While adoption is rising,
human technicians remain essential, with AI handling about 20% of
calls at firms like Hoffmann Brothers. 

 FOUNDER COMMUNITIES (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Building a company can be extremely lonely, which is why finding
founder communities you align with can make all the difference. Many
of these communities will also offer founder retreats, which are a
great way to unplug and reset from the day-to-day grind. 

 WHY RACING TO $100M ARR DOESN'T ACTUALLY PREDICT GENERATIONAL
OUTCOMES FROM SCALE VENTURE PARTNERS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Scale Venture Partners' data shows no significant correlation between
rapid achievement of $100M ARR and eventual enterprise value.
Companies that take longer to reach this milestone often achieve
higher valuations, emphasizing the importance of sustainable growth.
Founders and investors should prioritize fundamentals, durable growth,
and strategic fit over mere speed.
