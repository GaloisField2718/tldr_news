HEADLINES & TRENDS

 DEVELOPING A COMPUTER USE MODEL (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Imagine an AI that can operate your existing software stack as
naturally as a team member would. Anthropic's breakthrough with Claude
3.5 Sonnet represents exactly this shift – instead of requiring
custom integrations, its AI can now directly control computers through
standard interfaces, moving cursors and typing like a human user.
While the AI's current performance (14.9% on OSWorld benchmarks) leads
the field, it trails human capabilities (70-75%), but the implications
are transformative. 

 THE US AI SAFETY INSTITUTE STANDS ON SHAKY GROUND (3 MINUTE READ) [6]


 The US AI Safety Institute (AISI), created by Biden's Executive Order
in 2023, faces an uncertain future without Congressional
authorization. Despite having partnerships and a $10M budget, the
institute could be dismantled by a future administration. Over 60
organizations, including OpenAI and Anthropic, are urging Congress to
codify AISI before year-end. 

 META INTRODUCES SPIRIT LM (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta has released Spirit LM, an open-source multimodal language model
that integrates text and speech capabilities. The model comes in two
versions, Base and Expressive, with the latter adding emotional nuance
through pitch and tone tokens. Competing with OpenAI's GPT-4o and
others, it's currently restricted to non-commercial research use.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO HANDLE THE EXIT STRATEGY QUESTION IN VC MEETINGS (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Early-stage startups should avoid including exit strategy slides in
their pitch decks. This article explains why discussing exits
prematurely can be counterproductive and offers guidance on how to
handle investor questions about exit strategies. The key is
understanding that VCs want founders obsessed with building massive
companies, not planning exits. Rather than trying to predict specific
acquirers or exit scenarios, focus your pitch on market opportunity
and growth potential. 

 THE MULTIPLAYER LEVER: HOW TO DRIVE PRODUCT-LED GROWTH VIA
COLLABORATION (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Multiplayer isn't just a feature – it's a growth engine hiding in
plain sight. While most products focus on individual user experience,
the real magic happens when you turn every user into a node in a
network. Collaborative users stick around longer, spend more, and
bring others with them. Here's the key: successful multiplayer
features aren't bolted on – they're baked into the core experience.
For founders, the message is clear: don't build features, build
networks. 

 CLOSED BOARD SESSIONS: FRIEND OR FOE? (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Great boards need space to think out loud. When your investor asks
for closed sessions, they're not plotting a coup – they're building
you a feedback loop. This piece explains why these private meetings
can be valuable tools for company governance and feedback, rather than
threats. It outlines two types of closed sessions - board-only and
board minus CEO - and provides guidance on implementing them
effectively.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WILL AI MAKE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE COOL AGAIN? (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Professional services revenue, traditionally viewed as a necessary
evil in software, might be getting a reputational makeover in the AI
era. AI implementation services could shift from one-time costs to
valuable, recurring revenue streams due to the continuous need for
model calibration and optimization. 

 HOW TO SET AND ACHIEVE AMBITIOUS GOALS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The secret to ambitious goal-setting isn't about aiming higher –
it's about architecting success through better structure. This article
introduces NCTs (Narrative, Commitments, Tasks) as an alternative to
traditional OKRs for goal setting. Start with a story (Narrative) that
connects your goals to strategy, then work backward to specific
commitments and tasks. This approach solves the common startup trap of
setting aspirational goals without a clear path to achievement. Most
importantly, it suggests that the key to becoming more ambitious isn't
starting with bigger goals, but rather building a track record of
consistently hitting realistic ones. 

 CHOOSING THE RIGHT LADDER (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The path to startup success isn't just about execution – it's about
choosing the right game to play. While you can build a good business
anywhere, building a category-defining company usually means competing
in the markets and networks where the stakes are highest. For
founders, this means making an early strategic choice: either commit
to climbing the most challenging ladder (usually meaning the US market
and primary innovation hubs) or risk winning in a smaller pond only to
be eventually outcompeted by companies that compounded their learning
in tougher environments.
