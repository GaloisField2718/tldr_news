HEADLINES & TRENDS

 LESSONS OF FIN FOR AI ASSISTANTS (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In 2015, Fin's team tried to build an AI assistant service and found
problems that even today's better AI can't fix. While they built good
systems for remembering user preferences and checking service quality,
they found a basic issue: when you stand between users and real-world
services, users blame you for every problem. Even with better AI
today, assistant services still face the same basic challenges that
made Fin change its business model. 

 IT'S 2025 AND SALESFORCE'S SALES TEAM IS PHONING IT IN (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The author shares a poor sales email from Salesforce that shows basic
mistakes: it doesn't know they're already customers, uses
unprofessional formatting, and offers limited meeting times. This
matters because even the biggest software company is sending
low-quality sales emails in 2025. The author suggests this happened
because Salesforce is using old contact lists, possibly outsourced
work, and junior sales staff with little training. 

 MORRIS CHANG AND THE ORIGINS OF TSMC (29 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Morris Chang's autobiography details the founding of TSMC, now a
leading semiconductor manufacturer. Despite setbacks at Texas
Instruments and General Instrument, Chang's vision for a dedicated
semiconductor foundry helped create the first major "fabless" company
model. Initially dismissed by industry peers, TSMC's success
highlights the foresight in Chang's strategies and his pivotal role in
shaping the semiconductor landscape.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE $1M ARR GROWTH PLAYBOOK (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In 2013, Ankur Nagpal was just another 24-year-old in New York trying
to figure out his startup path. A weekend project to help sell online
courses turned into Teachable, but growth was painfully slow - after
18 months, it barely made enough to pay one engineer's salary. Then
everything changed. Teachable grew 7x in six months by shifting its
message from "course software" to "build your dream business" and
leveraging successful creators as evangelists. The piece shares
specific tactics that worked, from live workshops that converted 30%
of attendees to online summits that brought in thousands of new
customers at once. 

 DISNEY'S $4B BAMTECH ACQUISITION (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The story starts with MLB trying to stream baseball games for Ichiro
Suzuki's fans. This small project grew into BAMTech, which solved
basic streaming problems like showing different content in different
regions and keeping videos in sync across devices. Disney bought
BAMTech for $4B and used it to build Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu. While
Disney's stock price has dropped 15% since launching streaming in
2019, and Netflix's has grown 277%, BAMTech's technology helps Disney
get more value from its $100B worth of movies and TV shows. 

 THE LUXURY OF DOING LESS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The writer shares how he now sees taking quiet time as a luxury,
unlike five years ago when he would have seen it as wasting time. He
points out that while many celebrate being busy and optimizing every
minute, true success often comes from having time to think deeply. He
explains how he protects his time: keeping his phone on Do Not
Disturb, scheduling thinking time each week, and going to bed early.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ISAAC ASIMOV ON CREATIVITY (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Asimov explained how people come up with new ideas in a 1959 essay.
He said that creativity comes from making unexpected connections
between things, like Darwin connecting animal species with Malthus's
ideas about population. Asimov believed people need to work alone to
be creative because sharing early ideas can be embarrassing. He said
groups should be small, relaxed, and free from judgment when people do
meet to share ideas. 

 O3, OH MY (31 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI has unveiled its o3 model, a significant advancement in
reasoning with a notable performance on programming and math
benchmarks. This model, which uses enhanced reinforcement learning,
set a new bar in various tasks, marking a substantial jump from its
predecessor, o1. While promising, the rollout emphasized safety, with
OpenAI actively inviting researchers for comprehensive testing,
highlighting both breakthroughs and the challenge of managing
increased compute costs. 

 THE MOMENT AI SURPASSES YOU (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The article looks at what happens when AI becomes better than humans
at their jobs. It starts with Lee Sedol, a champion Go player who quit
after losing to AI in 2016. The author shares how AI can now write
articles in his style in seconds, which makes him question his work.
The key point is that everyone who creates things will face this
moment, and they need to focus on what makes them unique - their human
experiences and judgment - rather than just their technical skills.
