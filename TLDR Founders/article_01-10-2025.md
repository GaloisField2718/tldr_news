HEADLINES & TRENDS

 OPENAI LAUNCHES SORA 2 WITH NEW SOCIAL VIDEO APP (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sora 2 delivers more realistic, controllable videos with audio and a
new TikTok-style app that lets users generate 10-second clips with
consent-based cameo uploads. The system enforces guardrails—no
public-figure use without permission, no explicit content, and shows
notifications when your likeness is used. The app is invite-only in
the US and Canada, but OpenAI plans further rollout and public access.


 VERCEL CLOSES SERIES F AT $9.3B VALUATION TO SCALE THE AI CLOUD (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Vercel secured $300M in a Series F funding round, raising its
valuation to $9.3B, led by Accel and GIC, with participation from
existing and new investors like BlackRock and Khosla Ventures.
Vercel's user base has doubled with notable clients like OpenAI and
PayPal, and the company plans to launch v0 Mobile, enabling app
development through voice and camera inputs. 

 FORMER OPENAI AND DEEPMIND RESEARCHERS RAISE WHOPPING $300M SEED TO
AUTOMATE SCIENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Periodic Labs has secured a $300M seed round from notable investors,
including Andreessen Horowitz and Nvidia, to automate scientific
discovery through AI. Founded by former OpenAI and DeepMind
researchers, the startup aims to create autonomous labs where AI
scientists, aided by robots, discover new materials like
superconductors. This approach seeks to generate novel data to advance
AI further in material science, competing with other entities in the
field.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW DO GOOD PRODUCT METRICS LOOK LIKE IN 2025? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Your sales team and growth team are both optimizing for speed, yet
you're still losing deals. New data shows why - top performers
activate 69% of customers within one week because they ignore
departmental boundaries. Most companies have sales perfecting their
pitch while growth optimizes onboarding, but the fastest activation
often requires mixing both. Maybe your differentiating feature works
better as an interactive demo before the sales call, not during it.
Maybe prospects need a brief demo, then product access, returning to
sales only when ready. 

 GROWTH HACKING (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Growth hacking, a term coined by Sean Ellis, focuses on driving
rapid, measurable growth through data-driven experimentation and
unconventional tactics. It emphasizes metrics like acquisition,
activation, retention, revenue, and referral, using the AARRR funnel
to prioritize efforts. Successful examples include Airbnb's Craigslist
integration and Dropbox's referral loop, highlighting creative
strategies that scale effectively. Growth hacking tools like SEO,
social media, and A/B testing are crucial, but must avoid
over-optimization, vanity metrics, and neglecting retention for
sustainable growth. 

 FROM MANAGING PEOPLE TO MANAGING AI: HOW THE SAME LEADERSHIP SKILLS
APPLY IN THE AGE OF AI (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Julie Zhuo emphasizes how AI turns everyone into managers, requiring
traditional management skills to handle AI agents effectively. Her
"diagnose with data, treat with design" framework highlights balancing
intuition and data in product development. Despite AI-driven
hypergrowth leading to poor data infrastructure, this isn't a
significant obstacle, according to Zhuo.

 HOW TO MAKE AI WRITE LESS LIKE AI (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A copywriter outsourced 100 blog posts to look like an agency, got
paid in full, and then a week later, the client demanded every dollar
back. The posts were grammatically perfect but strategically
worthless. That failure taught him what most founders miss about AI -
prompts don't matter if you're feeding it nothing. The fix is context
engineering. Before writing anything, gather customer interviews,
support tickets, and competitor messaging. Distill those into strategy
documents like positioning canvases and messaging frameworks. Only
after loading those as context do you start prompting. This works
beyond copywriting - a founder prepping for a board meeting shouldn't
ask AI for a deck but should first load market research and
competitive analysis, then let AI build the narrative. 

 THE BEAUTY OF CONSTRAINTS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Give your time unlimited time and resources and watch them build
nothing useful. An engineering leader kept seeing projects die not
from bad planning but from too much freedom - teams would list
requirements, estimate timelines, then stumble along optimizing
features that shouldn't exist. The counterintuitive fix is
deliberately limiting scope, resources, and time. 

 ALL EYES ON INFLATION (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 xAI launched grok-code-fast-1, expanding its tech demand due to its
quick, cost-effective coding model. Microsoft introduced MAI-Voice-1
and MAI-1-preview to develop proprietary AI models, showing
advancements beyond OpenAI's tech influence. Intel faces financial
strain with a $3.2 billion quarterly loss as it retains its foundry
business under government pressure. Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence Group
grew 26% in Q2, with AI-related revenues soaring. Fusion tech is
gaining traction with Commonwealth's $863 million Series B2 funding,
backed by notable investors like Google and Nvidia.
