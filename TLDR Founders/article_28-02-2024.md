STRATEGIES & TACTICS

READ) [8] 

 Have you ever wondered how Zapier manages to dominate search engines
with its integration pages? This case study reveals the SEO strategy
behind driving 5M+ monthly visits. Zapier has established a strong
position in a category that it defined by targeting long-tail keywords
aggressively and creating pages for every possible integration. 

 HOW TO BUILD AND MEASURE TRUST WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Early-stage founders often mention "lack of trust" as a reason for
losing potential customers, but what does trust mean? Patreon created
a Trust Score to quantify trust after controversies threatened creator
relationships. Though not flawless, the score enabled the company to
make focused changes that turned negative responses into positive
feedback. Patreon's framework provides an instructive case study for
founders struggling to build trust. 

 MASTERING SOLUTIONS ENGINEERING FOR ENTERPRISE SALES (18 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 The sales process becomes more consultative and technical
integrations become more complex as you go up-market. To address this,
many companies create a solutions engineering team to help sales close
a deal. In this interview, Snyk's Global VP of Solution Engineering
dives into how the company built its team to ensure they work
effectively with sales.

 IN DEFENSE OF THIN WRAPPERS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GroupMe was initially an SMS-only application that could‚Äôve been
billed as a ‚Äúthin wrapper‚Äù around Twilio. To reduce costs, the
company migrated off Twilio, negotiated bulk pricing, and transitioned
users to a mobile app ‚Äì and it worked. GroupMe's challenges were
similar to to current challenges faced by companies that rely on large
language models made by companies like OpenAI. Founders must plan to
use multiple models, understand prompt routing, develop business
relationships with model providers, and secure additional funding for
unexpected costs. 

 DO YOU NEED A BUSINESS CO-FOUNDER? (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Conventional startup wisdom says having both a technical and business
founder is the recipe for long-term success. However, there are many
examples of highly successful companies like Google, Microsoft,
Coinbase, and NVIDIA that were founded solely by technical experts.
Instead of searching for a complementary co-founder, gaps can be
filled by hiring experienced senior team members early on in the
process. 

 HOW TO BUILD AND RUN BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS (7 MINUTE READ) [16]

 ANNUAL LAYOFFS, THE NEW BEST PRACTICE? (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Numerous layoffs have happened this year, even at well-performing
companies. Instacart went public and crushed the last quarter, with
$800M of revenue and $200M of EBITDA, and yet still laid off 7% of
employees. This would have been shocking a few years ago, but today it
feels like the norm. 

 ALWAYS LEARN BY DOING (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Learning to become a founder or to run a business is more like
learning a sport or an art than something theoretical. It's not a
skill that can be acquired in a classroom. You cannot become a great
quarterback or tennis player without stepping onto the field and
practicing. For those aspiring entrepreneurs, it's time to take action
and get started.
