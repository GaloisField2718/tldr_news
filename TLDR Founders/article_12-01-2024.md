 WATER BOTTLES & LESSONS IN VIRAL GROWTH (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stanley, a 111-year-old company known for its vacuum-seal bottles,
saw a dramatic increase in sales from $70 million in 2019 to $750
million in 2023 thanks to modern marketing strategies and the
popularity of its Stanley Quencher water bottle. The company's shift

social media, product variation, and collaboration, led to viral
success and a strong brand presence, especially among Gen Z consumers.

complexities and irrationalities of human behavior. We need to
recognize the limitations of analytics to fully grasp customer
motivations.
