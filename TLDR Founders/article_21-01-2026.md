HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHY ONE THIRD OF ALL STARTUPS ARE SOLO FOUNDED (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Solo founders now launch 36% of new startups, up from under 25% in
2019, marking the first time in over 50 years that a single founder
builds more than a third of new companies. AI tools let one person
handle coding, design, marketing, analytics, and support, enabling
solo founders to compete with multi-person teams. Investors are
increasingly backing solo founders because singular decision-making
preserves “authorship,” creating coherent products and faster
execution while avoiding co-founder conflicts. 

 MODEL-MARKET FIT (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Product-market fit has a prerequisite most AI founders ignore. Before
the market can pull your product, the model has to actually be capable
of doing the job. Legal AI was stuck for years until GPT-4 crossed the
threshold, then minted more unicorns in 18 months than the previous
decade. You can tell when MMF is missing by how human-in-the-loop gets
positioned. When it exists, human oversight is a feature. When it
doesn't, it's a crutch. The dangerous zone is betting on capability
that's 24-36 months away.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MASTERING COLD EMAIL (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cold email still works, otherwise nobody would be doing it. The
problem is that most people only understand adding volume when they
should focus on messaging potency. For less than $1,000, you can
personalize emails to 10,000 people in a day. The key insight is
rethinking your offer because demos are dead. Nobody has time for them
anymore. The best offers are valuable to the user, aligned with what
you actually sell, and filter for good-fit customers. 

 PERSONAL LAND-MINES DETERMINE STARTUP FAILURE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The biggest reason startups fail isn't market timing, competition, or
tech risk, it's the founder's personal life. Divorce, co-founder
breakups, substance issues, or shifting priorities are consistent
“land-mines” that end companies. Early-stage investing isn't just
underwriting an idea. It's underwriting a human over a long,
unpredictable journey. Founder durability and momentum through life's
pressures may matter more than almost any other factor in startup
success.

 WHY EVERY EXEC SHOULD BE VIBECODING (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The role of leadership is changing. Pure leadership and management
are no longer a full-time job. The future will see more seniors and
executives working as part-time individual contributors. Vibecoding is
a great way to experience the balance. Company leaders can't afford to
miss out on this skillset. 

 THE COMMODITIZATION OF SERVICES (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Before electrification, light was scarce and expensive. When it
became cheap, people stopped thinking about the cost of turning on a
switch. We're at the same moment with AI agents. Services that cost
hundreds of thousands will cost tens to hundreds. The current agency
model and vertical SaaS both rely on friction that's disappearing. If
the cost of production drops to near zero, price must follow.
