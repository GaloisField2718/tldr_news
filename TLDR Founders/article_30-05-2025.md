HEADLINES & TRENDS

 ON LEGACY (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 It's natural for founders to think about legacy - after all, we're
building something meant to last. Don't focus on legacy. Do your best
work right now, not for later. 

 WANDER: DEEPER DIVE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Wander's founder and its investors both thought owning vacation homes
was necessary to beat Airbnb's inconsistent quality. When interest
rates spiked, they had to test managing properties they don't own
instead. The results proved them wrong - growth exploded from 13 to
1,000+ locations while quality scores stayed at 85. Test your core
assumptions early, because the "obvious" path often isn't the right
one. 

 KNOWLEDGE WORK IS DYING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI will soon outperform experts in physics, law, and engineering
simultaneously, making knowledge workers replaceable. This author
coaches OpenAI executives who are building technology that will
eliminate their own jobs, and they're preparing by developing three
skills AI can't replicate. Emotional clarity means feeling your
emotions without letting them control decisions. Discernment requires
seeing yourself clearly before you can see situations clearly.
Connection involves genuine human presence that creates psychological
safety in teams.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MY GREATEST GTM STRUGGLE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A marketing founder generated $500k+ from LinkedIn content but
struggled with consistency because he relied on inspiration instead of
systems. He'd only create when he felt motivated, leading to sporadic
output despite strong results. His solution: monthly content planning,
weekly outlining, batch creation days, and three content pillars. Even
your best channels need systematic approaches to scale beyond "pretty
good" results. 

 TO GROW FASTER, THINK SMALLER (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Focus is crucial for effective growth strategies. Instead of making
large-scale changes, companies should study small customer segments to
discover insights that fuel new growth strategies. Understanding
current customer behavior provides a stronger foundation for
sustainable expansion.

 THE X-RAY EFFECT (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 You're now data-driven and tracking metrics that matter. However,
you're about to notice all the broken stuff - $500K deals sitting
untouched for eight months, reps with crazy-high win rates because
they only log deals after closing, and conversion rates bouncing
between 8% and 47% with no explanation. This is the X-ray effect -
consistent measurement reveals broken processes you didn't know
existed. 

 5 WAYS TO COME UP WITH TINY EXPERIMENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Big changes feel overwhelming, so try tiny experiments instead:
low-risk actions following "I will [action] for [duration]." Five
ways: notice what energizes/drains you and test alternatives,
challenge fixed mindsets with small actions, borrow interesting habits
from others, turn constraints into creative fuel, and ask "What if?"
questions. These build adaptability one small experiment at a time,
letting you learn and grow without needing perfection. 

 IT TAKES MONEY TO MAKE MONEY (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Traditional retirement funding is broken because capital consistently
outpaces economic growth (r > g). Someone saving 10% of $100K income
takes 20 years to accumulate $500K, while someone starting with $500K
replaces a year of income every two years. The solution isn't
redistribution, but "pre-distribution" of capital through innovative
financial products.
