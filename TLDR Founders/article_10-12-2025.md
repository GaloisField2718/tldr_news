HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE ONLY QUESTION THAT PREDICTS STARTUP SUCCESS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Jason Freedman has read 8,000 YC applications. They went back and
tested which questions actually predicted success by checking if they
would have disqualified the biggest outcomes. What predicted success
by a mile was determination. So predictive that YC took it and found
five different ways to ask it. 

 BIG IDEAS 2026: PART 1 (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Startups in 2026 will focus on transforming unstructured multimodal
data into structured formats, automating cybersecurity tasks to close
hiring gaps, and developing agent-native infrastructures for AI
workloads. AI will also enhance creative tools for seamless
storytelling across media, redefine data stacks with AI-native
features, and push traditional systems of record into the background
in favor of dynamic agent-led execution environments. Vertical AI will
evolve into multi-party collaborations, agents will prioritize machine
legibility over human interface design, and personalized experiences
will become the norm, culminating in AI-native universities and
interactive storytelling worlds.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A SIMPLE GUIDE TO VALIDATING PRODUCT IDEAS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 You've got an idea, and you're convinced it's great. You want to
start building right now. This is how founders waste months on things
nobody wants. PostHog's founders pivoted five times, and most of those
ideas never made it past a single conversation. The trap is asking
people if they like your idea - they'll say yes just to make you go
away. Instead, find out if they've actually had the problem and tried
to solve it themselves. If they built some crappy internal system to
deal with it, there's probably a business there. If it's not a
hair-on-fire problem for them, move on. 

 HOW TO ASK FOR HELP AND ACTUALLY GET IT (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Make help requests specific, finite, and actionable to increase the
chances of receiving assistance. Requests should clearly define the
commitment, showing preparation and ensuring the help will be
impactful. Avoid open-ended asks and demonstrate you have taken steps
on your own, and value the helper's input. 

 THE FOUNDER'S PLAYBOOK FOR PERFORMANCE CULTURE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Why do brilliant teams often plateau at $20M ARR? It isn't a lack of
effort—it's usually a lack of Single-Threaded Ownership. If two
people own a goal, no one does. This guide details how to build
performance infrastructure: hire for "capacity" (driving initiatives
start-to-finish), define specific actions that violate your values
(like saying "that's not my job"), and ensure every objective has
exactly one owner so performance is always visible.

 WHY STARTUP LEADERSHIP FEELS SO LONELY (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 It's normal to feel lonely, scared, or overwhelmed when in the
operator seat. You need to build infrastructure around yourself, not
just the company. Start building a support structure, and everything
will start to feel a little less heavy. Finding support and letting
yourself use it is part of the job now. 

 TWO WAYS TO WIN IN THE POST-SOFTWARE ERA (17 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI has opened up the potential for real innovation, but founders are
still building specialist AI products as if they were building the
same subscription software tools of the last decade. Specialization
will eventually lose out to simpler systems with more compute and more
training data. The businesses that will define this era will be the
companies that build what models need to get better, or companies that
discover work that's only possible because of AI.
