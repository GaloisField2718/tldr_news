HEADLINES & TRENDS

 SAM ALTMAN: THE INTELLIGENCE AGE (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In the coming decades, advancements in AI are expected to
significantly enhance human capabilities, enabling people to achieve
feats that were once considered impossible. This progress is driven by
deep learning, which has improved with increased computational
resources and data, allowing AI to assist in solving complex problems
and improving various aspects of life, such as personalized education
and healthcare. While there are challenges to address, including the
equitable distribution of AI resources, the potential for widespread
prosperity and innovation heralds a transformative era akin to past
technological revolutions. 

 SMARTSHEET GOES PRIVATE IN $8.4B DEAL WITH VISTA EQUITY PARTNERS AND
BLACKSTONE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Smartsheet has agreed to be acquired by private equity firms
Blackstone and Vista Equity Partners for $8.4 billion, transitioning
back to a private company after six years of being publicly traded.
This all-cash deal, which values Smartsheet at a significant premium,
is expected to close in January pending shareholder approval and
includes a period for exploring other offers. Smartsheet, known for
its cloud-based work management tools, serves a vast array of Fortune
500 companies and has seen substantial revenue growth alongside
reduced operating losses. 

 ANIME IS EATING THE WORLD (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The anime industry has evolved from a niche genre to a multi-billion
dollar industry, driving pop culture and influencing various forms of
media and entertainment. New technologies and business models, such as
AI companions, user-generated content platforms, and VTubing, are
accelerating the industry's growth and transforming the way fans
engage with anime content. As a result, anime is becoming a dominant
format for interactive entertainment, enabling fans to create, play,
and interact with their favorite characters and stories in new and
innovative ways.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GUIDE TO ANNUAL MARKETING PLANNING (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Marketing planning for startups is often viewed as a daunting task,
but it can be turned into a strategic and engaging process. By
concentrating on a plan that capitalizes on a startup's strengths,
establishing clear goals, and outlining impactful projects, marketing
teams can propel substantial growth and steer clear of haphazard
marketing activities. This approach not only aligns the team with
company objectives but also transforms the planning process into an
opportunity for creativity and strategic thinking. 

 NOTION'S JOURNEY FROM PLG TO THE ENTERPRISE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Notion has strategically expanded into the enterprise market,
leveraging its strong grassroots community foundation to meet the
growing demand from larger organizations. The company has focused on
enhancing security, user management, and collaboration features to
cater to enterprise needs while maintaining its core simplicity and
user experience. Notion's ambassador program and community-driven
assets, such as templates, have played a crucial role in facilitating
enterprise adoption, and the company has developed a sales-assist
model to support its product-led growth strategy. 

 MORE BRAND INSIGHTS FROM +546K AI-GENERATED OVERVIEWS (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Research has found that a website's visibility in AI-generated
overviews is more closely tied to its organic traffic and search
ranking than its inclusion in Common Crawl data. Additionally, user
intent plays a significant role in shaping the content and form of
AI-generated overviews, with different types of queries (e.g.
informational, local, or transactional) resulting in distinct formats
and features. While a higher organic search ranking increases the
chances of being cited in AI-generated overviews, it is not the only
factor. Many URLs cited in overviews rank outside the top 3 positions.

 CORPORATE SWAG WILL NEVER DIE (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Despite economic uncertainty and companies cutting back on certain
expenses, the corporate swag industry continues to thrive, with the US
and Canadian market reaching a record $26.1 billion in 2023. The
industry's resilience is attributed to its cost-effectiveness and
ability to provide a strong return on investment, making it a valuable
marketing tool for companies. As a result, the swag industry is often
seen as a leading indicator of the economy, with changes in swag
spending potentially signaling broader economic trends. 

 SHOCK-PROOFING SUPPLY CHAIN WITH AI: A $62 BILLION OPPORTUNITY (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Global supply chains continue to face significant challenges,
including fragmentation, unstructured data, and outdated systems,
resulting in estimated losses of $1.6 trillion over the past few
years. However, advancements in AI and automation offer a promising
solution, enabling companies to streamline operations, unify disparate
data sources, and replace manual processes. AI-powered solutions can
particularly benefit procurement, supplier intelligence, and demand
planning, with potential market opportunities projected to grow from
$29 billion in 2023 to $62 billion in 2028. 

 DO IT YOUR WAY (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Embracing individuality and authenticity is crucial for achieving
success and happiness in life. Trying to mimic someone else's approach
or conform to a standardized method can lead to mediocrity and
dissatisfaction. By recognizing and embracing our unique
personalities, skills, and goals, we can create a path that is
tailored to our needs and aspirations, ultimately leading to a more
fulfilling life.
