 HOW INVESTORS THINK AI WILL ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Investors are increasingly focused on AI coding as a monetizable
product category, highlighted by recent acquisitions and Anthropic's
significant $13 billion Series F funding round. Despite lower traffic
and user numbers compared to OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic is thriving
by catering to AI-driven software development needs, with its models
forming the backbone for many successful coding startups. Investors
are shifting towards clear, profitable use cases in AI, with
automation in the tech industry being a promising area.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 5+ HELPFUL WAYS TO USE AI FOR YOUR CONTENT PRODUCTS (6 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 AI tools like ChatGPT can streamline research, organize information,
draft supplemental content, overcome writer's block, and improve
accessibility with translations. AI excels at repetitive tasks but
requires verification and thoughtful use. While AI aids in the
creative process, originality and storytelling remain human domains. 

 FORECASTING ARR AND MRR (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most SaaS companies spend weeks building elaborate forecasting models
only to base projections on gut feelings, then act surprised when ARR
comes in 15% below target because they forgot about that summer churn
spike that happens every year. The companies that nail their forecasts
aren't trying to predict the future - they calculate churn, expansion,
and contraction as percentages of opening balance using six-month
rolling averages from their own historical data.

 FUND MATH FOR DUMMIES (14 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Venture fund success depends heavily on understanding ownership and
the role of outlier companies in generating returns. Despite
increasing fund sizes, many VCs face challenges capturing sufficient
value due to unrealistic expectations on investment outcomes. Smaller,
emerging funds often outperform larger ones due to better IRRs by
focusing on high multiples rather than sheer volume. 

 BUILDING UNICORNS WITH ONE-AND-DONE FUNDING (16 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI advancements now enable startups to pursue "one-and-done" funding,
drastically cutting personnel costs and speeding up time to market.
This approach reduces reliance on traditional VC funding and promotes
a rapid rise in software startups, sparking a surge in new, younger
founders. Venture capital firms, facing reduced demand from software
startups, might pivot towards deep tech sectors that still require
significant funding. 

 WHY VENTURE'S FUTURE IS BEING DECIDED BY A SELECT FEW (5 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Venture capital is heavily concentrated, with a small number of
ultra-unicorns receiving the majority of funding, while mid-tier
companies struggle. Companies like OpenAI and Scale AI have raised
massive rounds, distorting the funding landscape. The focus on a few
giants creates a fragile market, potentially ignoring smaller,
capital-efficient businesses that could offer significant returns.
