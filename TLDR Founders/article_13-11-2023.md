HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THINGS AREN‚ÄôT GETTING BETTER IN SAAS, YET (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 HubSpot, Datadog, Wix, and Shopify all recently posted healthy growth
rates. However, the reports from the CEOs at HubSpot and Zoominfo were
clear - things aren‚Äôt getting easier, but perhaps the worst has
bottomed out. 

 BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR ASKS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Imprecise asks from leaders cause a disproportionate amount of
turmoil and wheel-spinning. As founders, you can fall into the trap of
asking for something perceivably small in a meeting that actually
compounds into a large task involving lots of your team. Weigh those
asks carefully before you make them. 

 PURCHASING PATTERNS IN SOFTWARE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 You‚Äôve perhaps felt this firsthand from either side of the table.
We‚Äôre seeing slower and fewer new purchases of software. The average
sales cycle has lengthened from 32 to 44 days for net new software, a
37% increase.

 THE 10X EXERCISE FOR FOUNDERS (2 MINUTE READ) [8]

grew 10x. This thinking acts as a forcing function to think about the
future, now. 

 TEAM CHARTERS ARE A TRAP (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Building team charters probably shouldn‚Äôt be too high on the
priority list. The reasons involve the conflicts between bottoms-up v.
top-down creation and buy-in. 

 YOUR SMALL IMPRECISE ASK IS A BIG WASTE OF THEIR TIME (3 MINUTE READ)

into how Airbnb thinks about product development, unconventional

 THOUGHTS ON BENCHMARKING (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 How do you know what the average compensation or R&D expenses should
be for a company of your size, location, and function? Benchmarks. A
word of caution - benchmarking data doesn‚Äôt answer questions, but it
helps ask the right questions. You still need to do your own work to
answer them.
