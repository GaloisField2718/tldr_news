HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHERE RETURNS LIE IN VENTURE CAPITAL (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In the current VC landscape, early-stage funds face challenges from
multi-stage investment platforms and inflated AI deal premiums. To
generate returns, these funds should focus on non-consensus
investments, which are often overlooked but can yield significant
returns. However, making successful non-consensus picks is challenging
due to increased investor skill levels and the inherent risks
involved, including timing and market acceptance. Despite these
difficulties, thoughtful contrarian strategies can lead to substantial
gains and enhance a fund's reputation over time. 

 WHY VERTICAL INTEGRATORS ARE MISPRICED (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The concept of vertical integration is crucial in the development of
new technological paradigms, as it allows companies to design,
manufacture, and deliver products that are better, cheaper, and more
efficient than those of incumbents. Successful vertical integrators,
such as General Electric and Standard Oil, have shown that by
controlling the entire system, they can achieve significant gross
margin improvements and build long-lasting competitive advantages.
Today, as we enter a new techno-economic paradigm, companies that can
vertically integrate and deliver superior products at lower costs are
poised to capture enormous value and reshape industries. 

 GOLDMINE OR GRAVEYARD: DO PLATFORM SHIFTS PRODUCE INFRASTRUCTURE
OUTCOMES? (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Platform shifts, such as the advent of mobile and cloud technologies,
have historically led to significant venture outcomes by enabling new
consumer applications and enterprise solutions. However, the
assumption that each platform shift necessitates a new infrastructure
stack is often misguided, as successful infrastructure companies
typically address established problems rather than platform-specific
challenges. Today, the AI infrastructure market is experiencing a
similar surge in investment, but lessons from past shifts suggest that
enduring success lies in flexibility, adaptability, and addressing
fundamental issues rather than chasing short-term trends.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO BUILD A BETTER ARR REPORTING SYSTEM (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Defining and reporting Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) can be
challenging due to the unique combinations of product offerings,
pricing models, and go-to-market strategies that each company has. To
overcome these challenges, create a standardized "ARR flat file" that
transforms invoice or subscription data into a clean dataset, allowing
for easy calculation of growth, retention, and pacing. By templatizing
the ARR reporting process and using dashboard design principles,
companies can streamline their reporting and gain valuable insights
into their business performance. 

 THE VERTICAL SAAS + PAYMENTS PLAYBOOK (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Pairing industry-specific software with payment processing
capabilities can significantly expand a company's total addressable
market and improve customer retention. By owning key workflows before
or after a transaction, a company can naturally extend into owning the
transaction itself, creating a new revenue stream. This strategy has
been successfully employed by numerous large-scale vertical software
companies, leading to substantial revenue growth and increased market
value. 

 THE UNTAPPED B2B SAAS GTM CHANNEL: USER-LED GROWTH (7 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 As traditional B2B software growth channels become increasingly
saturated, companies are seeking alternative strategies to drive
efficient growth. User referrals, which involve incentivizing existing
users to champion a product and generate leads, offer a promising
solution with inherent benefits such as near-zero payback, higher
conversion rates, and increased customer lifetime value. By leveraging
user referrals, companies can add a new dimension to their channel mix
and achieve sustained growth, particularly in a market where capital
efficiency is becoming increasingly important.

 CURSOR: BEYOND THE HYPE (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This post reflects on the growing popularity of the Cursor IDE over
other options, attributing its appeal to a series of small, thoughtful
design decisions that make it stand out. It discusses the concept of
being "native" to a technology, which allows Cursor to deliver
superior features and new capabilities compared to competitors.
Through an experiment to build a website using Cursor without writing
code, the author identifies several observations about its strengths
and limitations, including its reliance on LLMs, in-context editing
capabilities, memory challenges, and the tendency to get stuck in
local optima during complex tasks. 

 WHAT CAN YOU STICK WITH? (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Consistency and persistence are crucial factors in achieving success,
but it's equally important to acknowledge that persistence isn't
solely a matter of willpower. Instead, it's often easier to stick with
a project or venture when it aligns with one's strengths, interests,
values, and desired outcomes. By understanding and leveraging these
personal factors, individuals can increase their chances of success
and achieve extraordinary results. 

 OPTIMISM RISES AMID CHANGING MARKET DYNAMICS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Despite economic challenges, the SaaS industry is showing resilience
and optimism, with founders reporting increased confidence and steady
fundraising expectations. Sales cycles are lengthening, but startups
are adapting by setting more ambitious targets and improving lead
conversion rates. The adoption of AI in sales and marketing is
widespread, but its impact is still being realized, with a discrepancy
between perceived and actual productivity gains.
