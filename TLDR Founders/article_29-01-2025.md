HEADLINES & TRENDS

 INFERENCE TIME COMPUTE (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 DeepSeek's new AI model R1 cost $10M to build instead of the usual
$100M+. This article looks at how AI costs are changing - instead of
spending mostly on building AI, companies now spend more on running it
daily. As AI gets cheaper to build, more companies can use it, which
means more computing power is needed overall. For investors and
companies, this means the real opportunity might not be in building AI
models, but in providing the computing power to run them. This shift
could create new winners in the AI industry. 

 MY PRODUCT WENT VIRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUT ALL I GOT WERE THESE SHITTY
USERS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Most users who find products through viral posts don't become real
customers. This article asks three important questions about growth:
Do users stick around? Can you get more users the same way? Do users
actually spend money? Through examples from recent product launches,
it explains why steady growth beats viral moments. Find channels that
bring in fewer but better users rather than chasing viral spikes that
look good on paper. 

 TECH CRASH? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DeepSeek's arrival has caused nearly $1 trillion in tech stock
losses, hitting companies like NVIDIA hard. Surprisingly, SaaS
companies went up 1% while other tech fell. This article explains why
this happened and what it means for tech company values. The market
shift shows how disruption in one area of tech can create unexpected
winners and losers across the industry.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO GAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH PAID MARKETING (12 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Competitor analysis has always been an integral part of many
successful paid advertising plans. However, other than making the ads
perform better and generate more sales, there are certain
competition-based strategies that can give your brand a unique
competitive advantage. This blog offers a comprehensive guide to
gaining a competitive advantage through paid ads, from tips on
crafting a unique value proposition and capitalizing on competitor
gaps to utilizing advanced audience targeting techniques. 

 HOW TO MEASURE R&D EFFICIENCY (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Engineering teams spend about half their time building new things,
and the rest maintaining old work. This article shows how to track if
R&D money is being spent well using real numbers from companies.
Written by Jellyfish's CFO, it gives finance leaders clear ways to
measure tech team performance. The most successful companies go beyond
just measuring time spent coding - they connect engineering work
directly to business results and customer needs. 

 PRODUCT GROWTH MODEL GUIDE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Companies grow in four main ways: getting new users, keeping current
ones, making money, and selling more to existing customers. This
article explains how successful companies grow everyone's job, not
just one team's work. It outlines five ways to grow, from letting the
product sell itself to using sales teams. Rather than picking just one
approach, the best companies build all these growth elements into
their product from day one.

 PAUSE AS A DECISION-MAKING TOOL (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Making quick decisions at work often leads to mistakes. This writer
shares how rushing a project estimate led to late nights and stress.
By making a rule to never give immediate answers, work quality
improved. The writer shows how taking time helps in tough situations
like managing teams or handling layoffs. Simple rules like "no answers
during meetings" are surprisingly powerful for protecting against
pressure and improving choices across all kinds of business decisions.


 TRUST AS A BUSINESS MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Companies like Vanguard and Costco succeed by charging less than they
could. This article shows how customers stay longer and tell friends
more when companies don't maximize prices. Using data from a
Stanford-MIT study, it explains why this works especially well for
businesses that need lots of happy customers. The data suggests that
deliberately leaving money on the table often leads to stronger growth
through loyalty and referrals. 

 HOW SOFTWARE FIRM MICROSTRATEGY'S BIG BET ON BITCOIN WENT
STRATOSPHERIC (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 MicroStrategy, under Michael Saylor's leadership, has transformed
into a "bitcoin treasury company" with aggressive investments in
bitcoin, vastly increasing its market cap and stock value. The
company's strategy includes issuing debt and equity to continually
purchase bitcoin, fueling a feedback loop of rising stock prices.
However, critics warn of significant risks if bitcoin's price falls,
as MicroStrategy's financial health is heavily dependent on its crypto
holdings.
