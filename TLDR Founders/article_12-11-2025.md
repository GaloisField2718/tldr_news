 MONETIZE AI LIKE THE PROS WITH METRONOME'S NEW HYBRID PRICING
FEATURES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Metronome is the monetization infrastructure platform trusted by

new capabilities - including 3 new ways to enable flexible and hybrid
pricing models [4]:

consumption. Assign credit allowances per user; pool usage across an
organization or per individual.

📦 PACKAGES; Manage standard pricing tiers in a
good–better–best model. Provision customers instantly without
engineering involvement.

🪜 ACCOUNT HIERARCHY: Create parent–child contract structures.
Roll up usage, commitments, and reporting into a single organization.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE FIRST $100,000,000 ARR AT DATADOG (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 It's hard to imagine what real customer focus looks like before a
company has revenue, but Datadog built it in from the start. The
founders spent six months interviewing users before writing code,
opened betas so customers could self-select, and sold month to month
to spot churn immediately. That approach scaled to 700 employees and
$100 million ARR. Engineers still rotate through support, pricing
talks double as product feedback, and leadership treats every
complaint as a signal. The result is a culture designed to find bad
news fast and fix it before it compounds. 

 FOUNDERS AND INVESTORS SLAM UK “EXIT TAX” (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The UK government is considering a 20% “exit tax” on founders who
build businesses in Britain but move abroad to avoid taxes. More than
150 entrepreneurs and investors - behind companies like Beamery, Cleo,
and funds including Dawn Capital and 20VC - have pushed back, warning
it would punish success and drive talent out. They say Britain already
feels less competitive after capital gains hikes, and another tax like
this could be the final push for many to leave.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 STARTUP OPERATING PRINCIPLES (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sam Gerstenzang grew from a fine to a good operator in three and a
half years of working at Stripe. This post shares how Stripe
approaches decision-making and communication. Operating well is a
state. Peak performance is a constant process of tweaking, iterating,
and tuning. 

 STRATEGISM: MASTERING THE FOUNDER LETTER (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In an era of formulaic marketing and AI-written content, the founder
letter stands out as one of the few tools that still feels human. It
works because it earns trust through story instead of shouting for
attention - naming a problem, stirring emotion, and only then offering
the solution. From Jason Fried's product launches to the plainspoken
clarity of Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett, the format proves that
narrative still builds belief and conviction. Even small tests show it
moves results: pages using a founder's voice convert higher because
readers can tell when something was written by a person who actually
means it. 

 HOW TO ACTUALLY RAISE YOUR ROUND (24 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Genomines' founder spent 14 months doing exactly the same thing: he
pitched the same company over hundreds of conversations, facing the
same objections and polite rejections. Then he closed $45 million from
12 funds. This post looks at what it really takes to raise a round.
It's a messy and non-linear process.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE COMPANY AS A MACHINE FOR DOING STUFF (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Companies are machines for doing the stuff a founder really wants to
do, but bigger. The company is a vehicle to accomplish a goal that
would otherwise be impossible alone. Many founders have found wealth,
yet they reinvest it to reach further. Many people work for the fruit
- it is rare to find people who work for the work itself. 

 THE COMPOUNDING STARTUP (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 An analysis of 6,525 software companies revealed that outliers and
"normies" had nearly identical metrics at $1M ARR (the top 25% of
failures actually grew faster than half the eventual winners). The
difference emerged in relentless operational improvement: 86% of
outliers increased expansion revenue by 10%+, 72% boosted ARPA
significantly, and 51% improved retention - all while “normies”
stayed mostly flat. The compound effect is staggering as a 50%
improvement in pricing for new customers doubled annual growth rates
from 11% to 24%, while combining better pricing and retention took
growth "off the charts." 

 SOFTWARE IS THE NEW ART FORM (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Just as furniture, fashion, and food progressed from essentialist
basics to art forms that make you feel something, software is
speedrunning the same transformation. The frontier is now defined by
software that either expands what's possible or makes you feel - and
occasionally does both.

 WHEN WORK STOPPED BEING A PLACE (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Remote work gave us flexibility, but killed the "learning by osmosis"
that happened when juniors could watch seniors read a room, make tough
calls, or answer dumb questions during a coffee break. 

 OPTIMIZING THE LANDING PAGE (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Tweaking and obsessing over your conversion rates won't save you if
