HEADLINES & TRENDS

 FIGMA'S TOP VCS ARE SITTING ON $24 BILLION WORTH OF STOCK AFTER
MASSIVE IPO POP (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Following its massive IPO debut, Figma's value surged to nearly $68
billion, with initial investors like Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner
Perkins, and Sequoia holding $24 billion in stock. The IPO raised $1.2
billion, with most proceeds going to existing investors, although a
lock-up period restricts major sales until January. This marks a shift
for the tech IPO market, previously slow due to inflation and market
conditions, with Figma standing out as a significant success story. 

 AI INFRASTRUCTURE COMPANY FAL RAISES $125 MILLION, VALUING COMPANY AT
$1.5 BILLION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI infrastructure company fal raised $125 million in a Series C
round, led by Meritech and joined by Salesforce Ventures, Shopify
Ventures, and Google AI Futures fund, valuing it at $1.5 billion. Fal
specializes in running multimodal models for enterprises, such as
image generation AI for ecommerce and advertising. Enterprise clients
use fal to create infinite ad iterations and different product images,
providing significant value through diverse asset customization. 

 TIMING IPO WINDOWS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After 2021's ZIRP era, tech executives swore they'd never miss
another liquidity window - yet here we are with barely any IPOs
despite markets at all-time highs. Since the election, speculative
stocks like ARKK have outperformed the Mag7 by 5x. Companies keep
waiting for the "perfect" IPO window while multiples march back toward
2021 levels, and recent IPOs like Rubrik and Circle show strong
performance. The few who prepared early are capitalizing - Figma's is
massively oversubscribed. In an industry where barriers to competition
are falling and public markets are begging for new names to bid on,
waiting for the perfect moment is the exact mistake everyone promised
they wouldn't repeat.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FOOSBALL AND THE STARTUP JOURNEY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 David Cummings shares the memory of securing office space with a
foosball table early in his startup journey. He recounts signing up
for a credit card to purchase a foosball table after relocating to a
new office space due to cash constraints. The story highlights the
evolving nature of startup culture and the importance of cherishing
early entrepreneurial experiences. 

 PUTTING THE JOBS TO BE DONE INTERVIEW TO PRACTICE (20 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Executing a JTBD (Jobs to be Done) interview process revealed that
interview difficulty stems from the need for ethnographic research
skills and overcoming human memory limitations. The recommendation is
to focus on recent buyers and conduct partner interviews to improve
accuracy. JTBD insights at Commoncog discovered two customer paths to
membership, revealing a predominant conversion via paywalled articles
within series, challenging prior assumptions and guiding strategic
focus. 

 ARR DOESN'T NEED A REDEFINITION (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Everyone's panicking about how to measure ARR with AI's usage-based
pricing, but ARR was never that clean. Snowflake is entirely
usage-based yet valued as recurring revenue. Datadog mixes flat fees
with variable metrics. Even traditional SaaS has messy pricing -
customers can be charged by seats, active users, and usage tiers all
at once. What makes revenue "recurring" isn't whether it's fixed
monthly, it's whether you can predict it with confidence. Your job is
to define ARR honestly for your business model, not game it to fit
some perfect definition.

 ENCORE ANXIETY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The first time they tried stand-up comedy, this author strategically
picked an open mic in a neighborhood where nobody knew them - failure
would be anonymous. The set went well. The second time was different -
now people had expectations, and expectation brings its own terror.
Success creates a special hell where you're not afraid of being a
fraud, but afraid you're genuine and still can't summon that magic
again. The antidote isn't caring less but caring more about
truthseeking - whatever that meant before anyone was watching. 

 VIBE ANALYSIS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 If vibe coding is creating software by talking to AI, vibe analysis
is getting insights the same way - and it might be even bigger. There
are 2 million software engineers in the US, but at least 5 million
people who pull data to answer questions every day. That's 10 billion
hours annually spent on reports, dashboards, and deciding which
experiments to ship.

AN EYE TOWARD ACQUISITIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [16]

The company plans strategic acquisitions and tech investments. Co-led
by SurgoCap Partners and T. Rowe Price, the round included existing

and supports private market investments and asset management.
