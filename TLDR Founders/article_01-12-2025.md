 📊 STARTUPS ON CARTA COMBINED TO RAISE OVER $27 BILLION IN Q3 2025
— SEE WHAT'S DRIVING GROWTH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Startups on Carta raised the highest amount of funding in three years
— up 48% over 2023. The latest State of Private Markets [4] report
analyzes this and other trends in the venture capital industry.

Read the report to learn why [4]:

 	* Early-stage valuations are rising
 	* Down rounds are growing less frequent
 	* The Bay Area still reigns supreme

Although most of the market is raising at steady levels, a few
mega-checks, sometimes reaching billions of dollars, are influencing
Q3 totals and valuation benchmarks.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 SUPABASE CEO ON THE "PAINFUL" DECISIONS THAT BUILT A $5B COMPANY (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Supabase, valued at $5 billion, raised $100 million after previously
raising $200 million at a $2 billion valuation. Its CEO, Paul
Copplestone, prioritizes sticking to a product vision over accepting
demanding enterprise contracts. 

 WHAT DOES A "HEALTHY" VENTURE MARKET ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE? (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Boutique Seed funds continue to lead the majority of sub-$10M rounds,
despite mega-funds increasingly entering earlier-stage investments.
Series A activity clusters around $20M, but competition intensifies
above that level, with mega-funds taking a dominant role in rounds
above $50M. This shift in dynamics compels investors to differentiate
by emphasizing talent and innovation, as traditional stage boundaries
blur and AI drives significant opportunity for reinvention.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO SELL TO ENGINEERS (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Engineers assume all salespeople are incompetent. They think about
scalability, speed, and reliability, but not money so much. Focus on
how your product will save time and reduce effort. Don't be too loud,
don't agitate them, and let them come to you. 

 MOST COMMON ACCOUNTING MISTAKES (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are a lot of accounting mistakes that can make benchmarking an
apples-to-oranges comparison. Your accounting needs to be clean, or
your leaders and board won't trust you. This post discusses the most
common accounting mistakes. Don't wait until you are deep in M&A
diligence or prepping for an IPO before correcting these mistakes, or
it may materially impact metrics. 

 PETER THIEL ON HOW TO IDENTIFY GREAT TALENT (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Peter Thiel recruited the founders of YouTube, LinkedIn, Yelp, and
Affirm before any of them started those companies. When asked what he
looks for in undiscovered talent, he said he wants people who are both
stubborn and open-minded.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY AIRTABLE BOUGHT DEEPSKY (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Airtable recently acquired DeepSky just four months after launch. The
speed of the deal signals a shift in what enterprises value in AI.
While most startups compete on the "execution layer" (writing text or
code faster), DeepSky focused on the "judgment layer" - the messy
research and reasoning that happens before a decision is made. Instead
of instantly answering a prompt, the system pauses to plan, runs
parallel research threads, and synthesizes findings into business
memos. Airtable owns the workflow. By acquiring DeepSky, it now owns
the thinking that feeds it. 

 9-9-6-0: WHEN ALL YOU BUILD IS CHARACTER (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The current AI gold rush is built on a dangerous gamble: trading
"996" work weeks (9 am to 9 pm, 6 days a week) for a future lottery
ticket. While VCs risk borrowed money, employees risk borrowed time -
an asset that cannot be refunded. When the bubble inevitably bursts,
many will face the "9-9-6-0" outcome: years of sacrifice that yielded
zero dollars. 

 YOUR PERFECTIONISM IS LYING TO YOU (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 We often mistake perfectionism for "high standards," but it is
usually just procrastination wearing a tuxedo. The obsession with
flawlessness prevents you from finishing. In creative work, completion
is the only currency that matters. The most successful builders shift
their goal from being "perfect" to being "prolific." You are not
sculpting stone, you are planting a garden. The only way to get
quality is to force yourself to ship quantity.

 THE INFORMATION DIET (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Your brain evolved to seek information for survival, but the modern

 GARAGE STUDIOS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The "garage startup" is a Silicon Valley cliché, but the psychology
behind it is real. 

 CHECKLIST FOR VC DUE DILIGENCE (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 VC due diligence involves evaluating a startup's founding team,
