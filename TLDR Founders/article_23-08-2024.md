 AMERICA'S FAVORITE FAST FOOD IS ABOUT TO GET DISRUPTED (SPONSOR) [4]

valued at $81.8bn, and projected to reach $114.7 billion by 2030. And
new technology has the potential to make a big difference when it
comes to profit margins‚Ä¶

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 YOUR STARTUP IS ALWAYS FOR SALE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CEOs often maintain an "always for sale" mindset in VC-backed
companies, balancing the goal of building long-term value with the
need to be attractive to potential buyers. This dual focus arises
because acquisitions are a more common exit strategy than IPOs, given
the rarity of companies going public. Employees may not be aware of
acquisition discussions until they are finalized, as CEOs must
navigate the complexities of both growing the business and preparing
for potential sales without causing unnecessary anxiety. 

 GONG'S PATH TO PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A successful startup, Gong was founded by Eilon Reshef and Amit
Bendov, who had a clear vision for an AI-powered platform to help
sales teams better understand customer interactions. Despite initial
doubts from investors, the duo remained committed to their vision and
eventually found product-market fit, which led to rapid growth and
over $584 million in funding. Reshef attributes their success to a
combination of his technical background, Bendov's sales expertise, and
their ability to balance long-term strategy with customer input. 

 OPEN QUESTIONS ABOUT AI (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The landscape of AI development is evolving rapidly, with significant
focus on the infrastructure and tooling supporting large language
models, the differentiation of AI inference clouds, and the
optimization of hardware for AI tasks. There is ongoing debate about
the dominant model architectures, such as transformers versus Mixture
of Experts, and the role of agents in web traffic. The market
structure for foundation models is also in flux, with Big Tech
companies potentially consolidating their positions, while
applications of AI are exploring differentiation through UI/UX,
product velocity, and data acquisition strategies.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR GUIDE TO GOING ACCOUNT-BASED (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In today's challenging business environment, companies are embracing
account-based strategies to effectively build their sales pipeline.
Implementing a successful account-based approach involves teamwork and
alignment across the entire go-to-market team. The focus is on
targeting the right accounts, creating personalized plays, and
measuring success based on closed deals and pipeline growth. 

 THE SECRET OF THE BEST ENGINEERING MANAGER I KNOW (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This article discusses the concept of "givers" in the workplace,
people who unconditionally help others without expecting anything in
return. While givers may initially underperform due to their focus on
helping others, they often become the highest achievers in their
fields over time. However, over-giving can be dangerous as it can lead
to exhaustion, exploitation, and dependency. 

 WHAT IS GOOD AND GREAT RETENTION? (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Retention is a crucial metric for businesses, as it indicates
product-market fit and drives acquisition strategies. Different
industries have varying retention benchmarks, with consumer social
platforms aiming for 25-45% retention, while enterprise SaaS companies
strive for 70-90% retention. By understanding and optimizing
retention, businesses can improve their overall performance and
growth.

 THE CPO WHO AUTOMATES HERSELF WITH AI (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Claire Vo, a successful product leader, is leveraging AI to
revolutionize the product management landscape with her side project,
ChatPRD. ChatPRD acts as a product manager copilot, significantly
reducing the time required for tasks like writing PRDs. It has
demonstrated early product-market fit by spreading organically within
and beyond Vo's company. Vo believes AI will transform product
management roles, either by broadening the skill set of product
managers to include more design and engineering tasks or by enabling
design and engineering teams to take on product management
responsibilities, ultimately requiring PMs to become more technical
and proactive in building solutions. 

 AD GAMIFICATION IS HERE (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Major brands are increasingly incorporating gaming elements into
their advertising strategies to engage users and make ads more
interactive and personalized. Companies like Disney, Amazon, and
Discord are embracing gamified ad formats, such as interactive brand
trivia ads and sponsored quests, in an effort to break through the
clutter and capture consumers' attention. The growing popularity of
gaming across various platforms, including mobile and streaming
services, highlights the potential for brands to leverage this trend
in their marketing efforts. 

 RECONCILING 'LIFE IS SHORT' AND 'OUR WORK SACRIFICES ARE SOMETIMES
WORTH IT' (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The recent death of Susan Wojcicki at age 56 has sparked reflection
on the tension between living life to the fullest and making
sacrifices for one's career. This author shares her personal
experiences navigating this balance, emphasizing that both
perspectives can be true simultaneously and that life is composed of
seasons with varying levels of sacrifice and renewal. Ultimately, the
key is actively deciding if the sacrifices are worthwhile in each
season of life.
