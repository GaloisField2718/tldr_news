HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE "KILL CHROME OLYMPICS" HAS STARTED (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Grok 4 just topped AI leaderboards. xAI now charges $300/month - the
highest consumer AI subscription yet. Meanwhile, every AI company is
building browsers to steal Chrome's lunch. Perplexity dropped Comet
yesterday with agentic features that handle clicking and typing for
you. OpenAI's browser is coming soon. 

 META'S REWRITING HIRING PLAYBOOKS: WINNING AI TALENT WITH BOLD
COMPENSATION (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta is challenging traditional hiring standards by offering top
talent compensation packages significantly above market rates. This
approach attracts both mission-driven individuals and mercenaries,
blurring the lines between passion and profit. Meta's strategy
disrupts compensation band structures and renders traditional
acquihires less appealing, raising questions about long-term industry
impact. 

 MUSK'S STARLINK RIVAL EUTELSAT RAISES €163M FROM UK GOVERNMENT (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The UK government has invested €163m in Eutelsat to enhance
Europe's technological sovereignty. Eutelsat, which merged with OneWeb
in 2022, offers low orbit satellites for secure communication,
challenging Starlink's dominance. The investment is part of a larger
€1.5bn fundraise alongside the French government and Bharti Space.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DISTRIBUTION - THE ONLY MOAT LEFT? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google used to send you 1 visitor for every 2 pages it scraped. Now
it's 18 pages for 1 visitor. OpenAI scrapes 1,500 pages per visitor,
Anthropic scrapes 60,000. AI is answering searches directly, keeping
users from clicking through. HubSpot used to get 39% of customers from
SEO - if that drops 80%, its acquisition costs explode. Companies are
responding differently. Ramp sponsored the TBPN podcast where its
audience lives. The winners own their distribution - newsletters,
podcasts, controversial stunts - anything AI can't steal. 

 THE FOUNDER'S GUIDE TO BUILDING A V1 OF CUSTOMER SUCCESS (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Spending half your day solving customer problems? Time for CS. Hire
an IC first who's done customer-facing work (even waiting tables
counts). Skip industry specialists unless your product needs deep
workflow knowledge. Ask "Tell me about a time you saw a problem and
fixed it" to test bias for action. Build two systems immediately -
support tickets and a 10-step onboarding checklist. Track product
usage as your main metric because if customers aren't using it,
they're not getting value. 

 CLEAR THINKING (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This engineering leader makes terrible decisions before morning
coffee, so he created automatic rules to protect himself. When clients
ask for timelines on calls, he says "I have a rule against estimating
on the spot." Nobody questions rules, they just accept them. The same
principle applies to bigger decisions - we're sabotaged by emotion,
ego, and laziness. His solution is forcing structure: write the
problem down first (you'll see gaps you missed), find three options
instead of settling for two, and ask "and then what?" to think past
the immediate outcome.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOLD MINES & SELF-TERMINATING BUSINESS MODELS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This founder built backyard houses until he realized his fatal flaw -
customers only need one house. Silicon Valley trains you to worship
recurring revenue, but his business was a "gold mine" where you sell
once and never again. Worse, every sale depletes your market. First
customers are eager early adopters, later ones need convincing. Casper
discovered this by selling mattresses that lasted 10 years, Sunrun
when solar got so cheap people stopped needing loans. Most founders
don't realize they're mining gold until they've already subsidized
growth like a SaaS company. 

 GENIES IS BUILDING THE VISUAL LAYER FOR LLMS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Genies has partnered with Unity to integrate its Smart Avatar
Framework into the Unity Editor, enabling the creation of
customizable, emotionally intelligent AI avatars for interactive
experiences. These avatars combine 3D models with AI-driven behaviors,
allowing real-time adaptation and interaction. The collaboration aims
to enhance game development and unlock new genres of AI-powered games
and interactive entertainment. 

 VELOCITY CODING (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This engineer has been writing 25,000 lines of code per week - 10x
his previous output - since quitting his job to go all-in on AI
coding. His method: spend most time writing detailed plans, then let
AI implement while he reviews in real-time. No fancy automation, just
extreme focus. He describes it like ego death - you stop thinking of
yourself as the coder and become a "vessel" that channels prompts into
existence. Everything becomes just typing, whether into Cursor,
Claude, or Slack.
