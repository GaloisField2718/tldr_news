 HIGH OBSERVABILITY COSTS? YOU ARE LIKELY PAYING FOR USELESS TELEMETRY
DATA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Coinbase's $65M observability bill showed how fast costs can grow.
They're not alone: observability costs are spiraling out of control
[5] across industries.

Your systems generate a constant stream of data. Much of it is
essential, but a surprising amount is just noise from routine
operations that add no value.

Dash0 lets you easily block this costly noise with a simple, visual
tool _before_ it costs you.

Start free with Dash0 [6] and take control of your observability
budget.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 INSIDE TRUMP'S AMBITIOUS AI ACTION PLAN (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Trump scrapped Biden's AI safety rules to let markets "win the AI
race" - but forgot to include a game plan. The 28-page blueprint backs
open-source AI and cuts regulation while keeping technical standards.
Good for researchers who need tool access. Bad for implementation: 103
vague actions with no deadlines, no funding, and a third don't even
name who's responsible. They'll track job losses but ignore AI fraud
and discrimination. Stanford HAI says without details, even good ideas
like regulatory sandboxes will die in bureaucracy. 

 PALANTIR JOINS LIST OF 20 MOST VALUABLE U.S. COMPANIES, WITH STOCK
MORE THAN DOUBLING IN 2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Palantir's stock surge has made it one of the 20 most valuable U.S.
companies, with its market cap reaching $375 billion, surpassing Home
Depot and Procter & Gamble. Investor confidence is driven by its
robust AI segment and its strengthened ties with the U.S. government,
reflected in a 45% revenue increase from its government business.
Despite being valued at 273 times forward earnings, the company
remains small in revenue compared to peers in the top 20. 

 INVESTORS ARE SUDDENLY PULLING OUT OF AI (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Investors who poured $104.3 billion into AI startups in 2025 are now
seeing lower returns upon exiting, with just $36 billion in cashouts
reported. Despite this disparity, AI funding continues to surge, led
by massive investments in companies like OpenAI and Scale AI. There
are concerns of an "AI bubble" echo, with some major players like
Microsoft pulling back, signaling caution around overvaluation risks.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MAX MRR: YOUR GROWTH CEILING (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Churn rate literally sets your maximum company size - divide new MRR
by churn to see your ceiling. Buffer discovered this brutally: at 6%
churn and $8,400 new MRR monthly, it was mathematically capped at
$140k forever. Even tripling marketing couldn't help because
exponential churn always catches linear growth. When COVID pushed
churn to 7%, revenue crashed 35% overnight. Here's the magic: cutting
churn from 6% to 3% doubles your ceiling instantly. Buffer finally
grasped this, reduced churn, and growth exploded. 

 SHOULD MY COMPANY INVEST IN A REDDIT STRATEGY? (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Reddit isn't just about Google rankings anymore - it's training the
AI that your customers use to research products. One First Republic
Bank user found something surprising. Reddit visitors converted just
as well as Google visitors. However, paid Reddit ads completely
failed. The difference is authenticity - Reddit users instantly reject
anything that feels like marketing. The real value is using Reddit as
a research lab. You can see exactly what customers ask about your
competitors when no one's watching. 

 5 HARSH TRUTHS OF MANAGING PRODUCT FEEDBACK (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Managing product feedback is challenging due to its messy,
disorganized nature, and often low-quality submissions. It requires
significant effort to gather, organize, and prioritize feedback,
differentiating between valuable signals and irrelevant noise. Despite
these challenges, understanding customer feedback is vital for
building products that users love and can significantly impact a
company's success.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DATA IS ACTUALLY NOT A GREAT VC-BACKED BUSINESS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Getting value from data is still incredibly hard, making data
businesses terrible VC investments. Auren Hoffman predicted
exponential demand, but fewer than 100 hedge funds buy alternative
data today. After 1,000 SaaS unicorns, there's been one DaaS unicorn:
ZoomInfo, which never took VC. Data companies grow slowly with
predictable revenue - perfect for PE, not VCs needing explosive
growth. 

 UNRELEASED OPENAI MODEL ACHIEVES GOLD MEDAL ON INTERNATIONAL MATH
OLYMPIAD (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 OpenAI's latest experimental reasoning model solved 5 of 6 problems
on the 2025 International Math Olympiad, earning 35/42 points. The
model won't be released for several months.
