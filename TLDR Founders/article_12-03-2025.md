HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHY IPOS ARE TERRIBLE INVESTMENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 64% of software IPOs fall below day 1 closing price after 6 months.
Investing equally across 55 recent software IPOs would have returned
-8% after 6 months, while the broader market returned +6%. The median
return from those IPOs is now -43%. Institutional investors capture
the "IPO pop" (median 38% for software), but retail investors buying
after this pop typically lose money. 

 HOW TO RAISE MONEY BY RIDING HYPE CYCLES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hype cycles start with a catalyst event (like ChatGPT's release) that
sparks investor attention, leading to high-profile fundraises that
inspire more startups to align with the narrative. This creates a
flywheel as VC attention—the truly limited resource—focuses on
that trend. When investors believe in massive outcomes, they'll pay
higher prices. Don't just fit into a trend—position yourself as
causing the phase change that creates opportunity. 

 THE 2025 FUNDRAISING GUIDE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Fundraising requirements evolve with your startup stage. Early-stage
startups must focus on vision and team, while later stages need proven
profitability and governance. The median time between funding rounds
has increased to 24+ months, so plan for at least 18-24 months of
runway. The current "flight to quality" mindset means startups with
efficient, profitable growth secure the best terms.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO MEASURE YOUR BUSINESS THE AMAZON WAY (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The secret accountability ritual behind Amazon's explosive growth:
the company reviews 400-500 metrics in just 60 minutes every week,
using consistent formats to quickly spot changes. It focuses on "input
metrics" (actions they control) rather than "output metrics" (results
they can't directly change). This system transforms vague goals like
"increase revenue" into specific action plans: improve conversion by
speeding up the site and keeping products in stock. 

 GUIDE TO CREATING WINNING SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY (14 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Social media is one of the very few channels that allows startups to
outcompete larger brands without a massive budget. With organic reach
declining and paid ads rising in cost, balancing both is critical for
growth. This step-by-step framework for building a high-impact social
media strategy covers everything from goal setting and audience
targeting to paid advertising and crisis management. 

 SPEAKING THINGS INTO EXISTENCE WITH AI (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 You can now create with just words—like making a working 3D game by
describing features. However, debugging requires deeper knowledge, so
your expertise still matters. AI doesn't eliminate expertise but
redistributes it. Your value comes from knowing what to create,
judging results, and providing feedback—not writing every line of
code.

 HOW AI WILL TRANSFORM BROKERS INTO MARKETPLACES (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Broker markets (real estate, insurance, and loans) are consolidating
as AI automates transactions. When brokers use AI for market access,
decision support, and price discovery, they gain marketplace-like
network effects and scale. The real opportunity isn't eliminating
expertise but identifying what "minimum viable knowledge" humans need
while AI handles the rest. 

 OUR SOULS NEED PROOF OF WORK IN THE AI ERA (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In our comfort-obsessed world, hard work remains essential—not for
success, but for happiness. The dopamine hits from comfort and
convenience ultimately make us less satisfied, while voluntary
challenges build resilience. Embracing difficulty in becoming the
person you want to be creates deeper satisfaction than the endless
pursuit of wants that AI promises to fulfill. 

 A QUARTER OF STARTUPS IN YC'S CURRENT COHORT HAVE CODEBASES THAT ARE
ALMOST ENTIRELY AI-GENERATED (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A quarter of Y Combinator's W25 startups used AI to generate 95% of
their codebases. This trend highlights the rise of "vibe coding,"
where developers rely on LLMs to create code while needing classical
coding skills for debugging and quality checks. Startups such as
Bolt.new and Magic have received significant funding, underscoring
growing interest in AI-powered coding solutions.

traditional VC funding.
