in AI agents.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 TRUMP STARTS TO BREAK THINGS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Trump's new 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico mark a dangerous shift
from his previous trade policies. These broader tariffs could disrupt
manufacturing supply chains and potentially reignite inflation. 

 THE STARTUP DRAKE EQUATION (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Like astronomers calculating the odds of alien life, startups face a
chain of critical factors that must all work perfectly. Failures in
any area - from product to team dynamics to market timing - can kill a
company. Founders can improve their odds against startup "natural
selection" by identifying their biggest risks early and focusing on
their unique advantages. 

 MARKET SIZING IN VERTICAL SOFTWARE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Successful software companies grow beyond their initial markets in
three ways: selling new products to existing customers, entering new
industries, or expanding along their value chain. Analysis of public
companies proves both high and low-revenue-per-customer models create
billion-dollar businesses. Founders should start with laser focus on a
specific market while keeping an eye on bigger expansion opportunities
ahead.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY THE MENTALITY OF LEAN AND SMALL ALWAYS WINS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Smaller teams can often outperform larger ones when they have the
right ingredients: high talent density, versatile skills, deep
experience, and strong trust. These traits allow small teams to move
faster, reduce dependencies, and foster a sense of ownership. Small
teams excel in exploring new tech, driving innovation, rapid
prototyping, problem-solving, and aligning cross-functional efforts.
"Fitscaling" with small, mighty teams will be the new competitive
advantage as companies emerge from the "blitzscaling" era. 

 DEEPSEEK: THE QUIET GIANT LEADING CHINA'S AI RACE (26 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Chinese AI startup Deepseek's R1 model outperformed OpenAI's O1 on
multiple reasoning benchmarks, solidifying its reputation in the AI
community. Led by CEO Liang Wenfeng and funded by the hedge fund
High-Flyer, Deepseek is focused on open-sourcing its innovative AI
models and cutting-edge architectural advancements like MLA and
DeepseekMoE, which have triggered price wars among Chinese tech
companies. Deepseek prioritizes AGI research over commercialization,
relying on a bottom-up organizational approach and a team of local,
highly-driven talent. 

 IS YOUR PITCH DECK GOOD ENOUGH TO RAISE? (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Successful fundraising is linked to selling the team's strengths,
addressing industry shifts, and demonstrating clear value. Effective
decks include detailed unit economics, customer-centric market sizing,
and clear runway calculations. Longer decks aren't better, so concise,
impactful content is key.

 THE HIGH EARNERS GUIDE TO A ROTH IRA (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Most high earners think they can't use Roth IRAs due to income
limits, but there are actually four legal ways to contribute large
amounts each year. This article breaks down strategies like the "mega
backdoor Roth," which allows up to $70,000 in annual contributions,
and shows how to involve family members in tax planning. Using
examples from real situations, it explains how to maximize these
accounts while avoiding common mistakes that could trigger IRS issues.


 RAISING A VC FUND IN A BEAR MARKET (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 VC fund Varrock's founder shares key fundraising insights amidst the
bear market. LPs prioritize concentration and ownership in venture
investments, preferring high ownership funds that don't overlap.
Despite rising crypto prices, many LPs lack dry powder, making
fundraising more challenging now. 

 PROFITABILITY CAN BE A FALSE GOAL IF YOU'RE PLAYING DEFENSE TO GET
THERE (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Startups should aim for profitability as a strategic advantage rather
than just survival. Founders play offense by using capital to enhance
enterprise value and considering potential acquisition attractiveness.
Playing defense involves focusing only on survival and ignoring deeper
strategic opportunities.
