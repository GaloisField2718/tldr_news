 HOW TO MAKE YOUR SAAS APP ENTERPRISE READY: WITH INPUT FROM PRODUCT
LEADERS AT TWILIO, RENDER, ASANA, SLACK, MOTIVE, AND MORE (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 If you are building a B2B app, at some point you'll want to start
selling to enterprises. You can expand your market size, decrease
churn, and accelerate revenue growth.

But selling to enterprises requires you to think differently about the
personas you go after, the product roadmap [4], and pricing/packaging.

WorkOS interviewed product and engineering leaders [4] who
successfully crossed the enterprise chasm. The result is a detailed
guide that explains how you can also make your app Enterprise Ready.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHICH BALANCE SHEET DO I BACK? (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 With tech leaders increasingly moving into government positions,
there's a growing push to run government more like a startup. However,
as Obama noted, government and business have fundamentally different
balance sheets - while businesses can choose their markets and
optimize for returns, the government must serve everyone and tackle
problems no private company would touch. While bringing tech talent to
government could help modernize certain functions, trying to run
government purely on business metrics would mean ignoring critical
public goods like education and veteran care that don't fit a VC's
return timeline. 

 PALANTIR - IS IT A BUBBLE? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 While Palantir trades at 50x revenue (vs industry median of 6.2x),
revenue multiples alone don't tell the full story. Three key factors
justify its premium: strong revenue growth with government stability,
high free cash flow margins at 39%, and low dilution relative to
growth. However, at current valuations, Palantir needs nearly perfect
execution for many years to justify its price. 

 DOMAIN-SPECIFIC MODELS IN 2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 2024 celebrated general AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. 2025
will be the year of specialized AI trained on private industry data.
These domain-specific models will excel in fields requiring deep
expertise like protein engineering and supply chain optimization,
where general models fall short. The shift marks the beginning of
enterprise AI, where companies develop models specifically for their
unique needs.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EXPLORE VS EXECUTE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most founders fail at the critical transition that comes after
product-market fit. The shift requires changing from an "explore"
mindset (rapid testing, accepting failures, questioning everything) to
an "execute" mindset (standardization, reliability, predictable
processes). However, founder arrogance often gets in the way - they
want to keep doing what worked before, not realizing that scaling
demands an entirely different approach. Making this transition
requires a fundamental culture shift that many founders struggle to
accept. 

 FRAMEWORKS FOR PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION (52 MINUTE VIDEO) [9]

Officer at Carbon Health, on product differentiation, team building,
and thinking from first principles. 

 GIVE AWAY YOUR PEOPLE (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Managers should anticipate high-performers leaving their team and
should have a succession plan in place. Their goal should be to help
these employees grow, even if that means they eventually outgrow their
current roles. This mindset can help create a positive culture where
people feel supported and empowered. Managers should maintain an open
dialogue about career aspirations with their team members, help them
develop a roadmap to achieve their goals, and build a strong pipeline
of talent to ensure continuity when someone leaves.

 THE TRENDERPRISE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The paradox of enterprise software lies in its buyers not being its
users. While employees despise Jira's clunky interface and complexity,
management keeps buying it because it serves their needs for control
and customization. However, this dynamic is shifting - modern startups
now target users directly, building tools people actually want to use
and forcing IT to adopt them through bottom-up growth. 

 STRATEGY & DECISIVENESS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 While "being strategic" is often equated with bold, decisive moves,
the most effective strategies might actually involve being
deliberately indecisive about many things. Most successful companies
operate with less decisive strategies than the romanticized stories
suggest, often keeping multiple options open while focusing decisively
on just a few key areas. Strategy isn't about having all the answers,
but knowing which questions truly need them. 

 THE MYTHICAL CREATURE OF SAAS: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (4 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Stock-based compensation (SBC) is a controversial topic in SaaS. In
the 2010s growth era, SBC fueled hiring with less scrutiny. However,
as the market cooled, dilution's impact on returns became a headline
concern. SBC often exceeds 20% of revenue, rivaling other major
expense categories. CFOs must thoughtfully balance SBC's benefits
(alignment, less cash burn) with dilution impacts. Having a clear SBC
philosophy is essential, not optional. SBC isn't inherently good or
bad - it's a strategic tool to wield intentionally.
