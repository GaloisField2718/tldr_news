HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE CRUMBLING WORKFLOW MOAT: AGGREGATION THEORY'S FINAL CHAPTER (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LLMs absorb the interface layer of vertical software, collapsing
workflow-based moats and turning products into interchangeable APIs.
When users interact only through chat, suppliers lose brand, UX, and
switching costs, forcing competition on data quality, coverage, and
price. This completes Aggregation Theory by eliminating interface
defensibility, triggering valuation compression for software companies
without truly proprietary data. 

 FRIENDLY ADVICE FOR MY STARTUP FOUNDER FRIENDS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Solve for customers and your market, not for investors and media.
Help customers understand what you do for them. This will help
investors understand you better as well. Frame what you do from the
perspective of customers - investors usually don't know what the
current hot buzzwords mean either.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CLOSING YOUR FIRST $1M ARR WITH FOUNDER-LED SALES (10 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Nobody wants to hear this, but Resend CEO Kushal Byatnal's path to
his first $1M in ARR was mostly just showing up. In-person meetings.
Manual cold emails. Reading buying signals that most founders miss
because they're too busy trying to automate everything. He shared the
whole playbook, and it's refreshingly unglamorous. 

 THE REDDIT PLAYBOOK THAT GOT 1,000 USERS FOR FREE (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This company got its first 1,000 users entirely from Reddit before
raising a cent. Millions of people are already talking about the exact
problems your product solves, and most founders completely ignore
them. The founder has shared the full playbook for finding those
threads, jumping in without being salesy, and converting lurkers into
actual users for free. 

 REZA KHADJAVI ON BUILDING MOTION, BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN CREATIVE
AND DATA, AND WHY B2B BRANDS NEED CONSUMER DNA (48 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Reza Khadjavi, CEO of Motion, explains how the company transitioned
from a Shopify app to a creative analytics platform, emphasizing the
importance of creative over audience targeting in advertising. Motion
fostered the role of creative strategist, focusing on merging data and
creativity, which is now leading in marketing strategies. As AI
reshapes industries, Motion has adapted to be AI-native, demonstrating
the necessity for B2B brands to adopt consumer-style marketing
approaches.
