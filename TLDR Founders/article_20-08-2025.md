DEFENSE-TECH BETS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Saronic is positioning itself in the defense-tech sector with
autonomous surface vessels, securing $600 million in Series C funding
and targeting military contracts amidst a US Navy shipbuilding crisis.
Despite some skepticism about its strategy, Saronic focuses on landing
smaller contracts and developing prototypes to eventually secure a
major program of record. The company's revenue projections for 2025
have jumped to $400 million. It plans to expand beyond the DoD to
clients like the Coast Guard and international allies. 

 DON'T SHIP YOUR PITCH DECK TO YOUR WEBSITE. HERE'S HOW TO TRANSLATE
YOUR STORY FOR CUSTOMERS (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Founders often mistakenly use their investor pitch deck for customer
marketing, ignoring that investors and customers have different
priorities. Effective early B2B marketing requires tailored messaging
that focuses on a specific audience's immediate needs, not the broad
vision in a pitch deck. Translate pitch deck messages into clear
customer-focused website content by addressing specific pain points,
differentiating the product, and building trust with social proof.
Ensure communication is relevant, precise, and customer-centric.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO MAKE A VIRAL LAUNCH VIDEO (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Six founders who went viral share how they turned product launches
into millions of views and instant waitlists. The pattern across all
winners? Show, don't tell, make viewers say "I can't believe this
didn't exist," and treat launches as weapons, not your end goal.
Silicon Valley now treats B2B software like entertainment products
because everyone's fighting for attention. Early investors literally
write checks based on viral tweets - social media has become social
currency. 

 HOW WISPR FLOW FOUND PMF THROUGH A PIVOT: WISPR FLOW DISCUSSION
FORUMS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Wispr Flow pivoted from a hardware focus to a software-centric voice
dictation platform upon realizing there was limited market demand for
its initial product. It cut its workforce substantially and launched
Wispr Flow, which quickly gained traction with strong user adoption
and a high paid conversion rate. The pivot emphasized listening to
customer needs and moving swiftly to achieve product-market fit. 

 4 AI WORKFLOWS TO HELP YOU SHIP BETTER PRODUCTS (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post drops four prompts that actually move the needle for
product teams. The first prompt uses computer control models to crawl
your actual product and build a feature taxonomy from the user's
perspective. The second prompt turns boring product strategies into
narratives that sell your vision. The third prompt frames every PRD
within your overall strategy so initiatives aren't just random
features, but steps toward your vision. The fourth prompt evaluates
your plans like a brutally honest CPO who'll call out second-order
effects and hidden risks. These aren't just prompts, but a framework
for decomposing tasks and bringing expertise to get outputs worth
shipping.

 CAPITAL AND INDUSTRY (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI's intelligence layer has become a balance-sheet arms
race—capital expenditures in the hundreds of billions. The door is
closed for new challengers. Investment returns will concentrate on a
handful of at-scale companies. 

 THE CASE FOR STAYING PUT (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 After three years in one apartment, this author discovered what
digital nomads miss: real connection only comes from dealing with a
place's boring parts. He spent years hopping between cities, thinking
each Instagram-worthy location would make him happy. However, constant
movement meant never belonging anywhere. The case for staying put is
simple - you can't build meaningful relationships or impact when
you're always leaving. The daily annoyances, the negotiations with
neighbors, the commitment to local problems - that's what creates
actual community. 

 RAG IS DEAD, CONTEXT ENGINEERING IS KING (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Chroma's founder says RAG is dead because it bundles three concepts
poorly - the real job is context engineering, figuring out what
belongs in the context window for each LLM generation. The best teams
now use a two-stage approach: first-stage retrieval (vector search,
text search, and metadata) culls 10,000 candidates down to 300, then
LLMs re-rank those to the final 20-30. This matters because context
rot is real - despite perfect needle-in-haystack marketing, models
degrade as you add tokens. The future looks radically different:
models will stay in latent space without converting back to text and
retrieve continuously during generation instead of once at the start.
What we call "memory" is just context engineering with better
branding.
