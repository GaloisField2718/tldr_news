HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE DEATH OF A VENTURE FUND (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenView Venture Partners, a 20 year old fund with $2.4m AUM,
recently announced it was closing its doors to much surprise. This
article explores the reasons that cause funds to collapse and the
often slow death that takes place considering they‚Äôre still holders
of illiquid assets. 

 7 WAYS THE INTERNET WILL GET WEIRDER (16 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A fascinating teardown of the features on the internet that would
seem incredibly odd to previous generations. From online best friends
to the future of video, AI is going to play a huge role in how the
makeup of our work and play evolves over the coming decade. 

 #159 - BACK TO BASICS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In this 2023 Q3 e-commerce review, we see the emerging trends and
calls for caution around Q4. These kinds of reports give a good
indication of spending habits of consumers (hint: thrifty) as well as
what‚Äôs happening with startups in general.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT‚ÄôS THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE SALES LEADERS MAKE? (1 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Sales is a people business, and the biggest failure is around
recruiting the right people to help you build and run the engine. 

 EXPERTISE IS PLENTIFUL OUTSIDE VENTURE FIRMS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An interesting take on entrepreneurship and raising money. Given that
venture capital has not had the best year, and the rules are changing
in startup financing in general, taking on venture might not mean you
have your outcomes aligned. Think twice and know there are plenty of
other places to find market expertise. 

 OVERAGES: THE OVERLOOKED PROBLEM IN USAGE-BASED PRICING AND HOW TO
FIX IT (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Usage-based pricing is more interesting than ever in the age of AI. A
lot of companies and sectors don‚Äôt want to commit to SaaS-type
upfront pricing as they don‚Äôt see the value or it doesn‚Äôt align
with how they do business. Finding a balance of upfront vs usage-based
pricing, as well as leaving room to make sure whatever you put in
place isn‚Äôt a hindrance, is the key to success.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE DEATH OF THE CREATOR ECONOMY (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The creator economy was valued at $104 billion in 2021. In 2022, the
funding for creator economy startups saw a precipitous drop from a
high of over $2.5 billion in 2021 to around $123 million in early
2023. Much like venture, power law exists across the creator economy.
A minor subset of creators make up the majority of the value
harvested. 

 A CONVERSATION WITH CHARLIE MUNGER AND JOHN COLLISON (100 MINUTE
PODCAST) [15] 

 Charlie Munger shares his ingredients for long-term business success
and the rise of Berkshire Hathaway over the years in this conversation
with Stripe's John Collison recorded last year. Munger passed away in
late November, and this is an excellent recount of his wisdom acquired
over the years. 

 THE WHERE, WHEN, AND HOW OF AI (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Leading founders and venture investors talk about what's happening in
AI, from the application of LLMs to enterprise innovation. If the pace
of ‚Äúthings you should know about AI‚Äù is somewhat overwhelming,
this is a good quick recap.

 GIG WORKING IS GETTING LESS PROFITABLE (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The gig economy is a roughly $1 trillion industry in the US. Gig
working provides a flexible way to make money, but it‚Äôs increasingly
becoming less reliable and the net growth of new gig workers is
declining. Valuable insights if you‚Äôre building a gig working
platform. 

 TWO TITANS ON THE FUTURE OF AI WITH REID HOFFMAN & VINOD KHOSLA (44
MINUTE PODCAST) [18] 

 From the Cerebral Valley AI Summit in November, this podcast combins
two interviews with tech titans Reid Hoffman & Vinod Khosla, gathering
their views on the future of AI and its impact on society. 

 GOOGLE‚ÄôS GEMINI MARKETING TRICK (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Why did Google, arguably the pioneer of all things generative AI,
feel the need to juice its marketing around the launch of Gemini? It
boggles the mind and shows just how much is at stake here in the game
of winner-takes-all in AI.
