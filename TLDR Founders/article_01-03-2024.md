HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THRASIO FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY AFTER RAISING $3.4B FROM INVESTORS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Thrasio, a leading Amazon aggregator, has filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy despite once being valued at $10 billion and raising $3.4
billion from investors like Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs. The
company, known for consolidating third-party Amazon sellers, plans to
undergo a restructuring process to reduce debt and secure fresh
capital. This shift reflects the challenges faced by similar
companies, including Perch and Elevate Brands, as consumer shopping
habits return to normal post-COVID-19. 

 GOAT‚ÄôS PRODUCT-MARKET FIT JOURNEY (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A counterfeit sneaker purchase led Eddy Lu and Daishin Sugano to
create an authenticated sneaker marketplace called GOAT that would
grow to 50 million members ‚Äî though not without painful lessons on
pivoting a business, reducing friction, and nurturing co-founder
relationships. 

 SNOWFLAKE CEO FRANK SLOOTMAN IS RETIRING AS CEO (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Frank Slootman, the CEO of Snowflake and a mentor/advisor to many
successful founders and executives, recently announced his retirement.
Sridhar Ramaswamy will be taking his place. Ramaswamy was the ex-CEO
of Neeva, a search engine start-up acquired by Snowflake last year for
$185 million, and also served as the chief of Google Ads. Snowflake
reported weaker-than-expected financial results and revenue
projections, which along with Slootman‚Äôs departure caused shares to
plummet by 20%.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RETHINKING THE MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT IN 2024 (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The traditional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) concept, where novel
ideas are validated as quickly as possible, is outdated, especially in
today's competitive market. It is now more about developing a product
that is appealing enough to attract early users to obtain feedback
that can be used to improve the product and create the best possible
version. 

 FOR PRODUCT-LED SALES, DON‚ÄôT HIRE SALES TEAM TOO SOON (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Product-Led Sales (PLS) focuses on allowing end-users to discover a
product's value through self-serve usage. Sales support is still
required for large enterprise deals. Hiring sales teams prematurely in
PLS can lead to low Average Contract Values and competition with
self-serve. Don‚Äôt add sales until you observe organic demand from
your self-serve user base that requires additional assistance to
purchase. Typically, these requests will come from sales form
submissions, social media channels, or most frequently, customer
support requests. 

 FOUNDER‚ÄôS GUIDE TO READING BALANCE SHEETS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Many founders and investors tend to focus on income statements (or
P&L) because they are the primary driver of a company's valuations. A
well-managed balance sheet helps a company grow, while a poorly
managed one can silently destroy it. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide on
understanding balance sheets for software companies.

 5 MUST-HAVE VIEWS FOR A SOFTWARE COMPANY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The 5 key views that startups must have to succeed are ARR Builds,
Cohort Analysis, Top of Funnel, Product Engagement, and Operating
Model metrics. Together, these provide a continuous overview of
customer acquisition and retention, product engagement, and growth
opportunities that can be leveraged for resource planning. 

 SHOW THE PRODUCT, YOU COWARDS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 80% of software companies never show you their product. Fine, that
statistic was made up, but why are fewer and fewer B2B companies
letting you try before you buy? Founders should showcase their
offerings through bite-sized video demos. This is an overlooked
opportunity for differentiation that builds social proof and trust for
potential buyers.

for improving product experiences.

QUICK LINKS

 START-UPS TAKING LONGER TO REACH FUNDING MILESTONES (1 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 New data reveals that, due to a combination of factors, startups now
take much longer to raise their next funding rounds. Early-stage
companies are taking in a lot more funding than they used to in SAFEs,
which extends the time to start priced round raises. Later-stage
companies who have seen significant cuts to their valuations aren‚Äôt
rushing to fundraise and are instead focusing on profitability. 

 VALUE BY ASSOCIATION (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 It‚Äôs natural to want to hire an ex-Google engineer versus an
engineer from an obscure company you‚Äôve never heard of. Sometimes
this is the right strategy, and sometimes it‚Äôs not. You need to
overcome your innate bias towards perceiving value by association. 

 THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ADVICE FOR A FOUNDER (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Being a founder is hard ‚Äî harder than almost every non-founder
realizes. All founders have moments when they want to throw in the
towel. However, if you have conviction in what you‚Äôre building, keep
pushing. If you don‚Äôt: figure out how to quit.
