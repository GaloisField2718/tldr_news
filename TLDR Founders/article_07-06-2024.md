HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE CONSUMER RENAISSANCE (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The consumer technology sector is poised for significant growth and
innovation in the coming years despite being currently undervalued by
investors. Venture capital data shows that consumer startups have a
higher likelihood of going public and achieving valuations over $10
billion compared to enterprise companies. The rapid advancements in
artificial intelligence are creating opportunities for disruptive
consumer applications, such as AI-powered avatars for language
learning and other use cases, which have the potential to challenge
incumbent consumer internet companies. 

 VC FUNDING TO FEMALE FOUNDERS PEAKED IN 2023 (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In 2023, a record-breaking 25% of U.S. venture funding, amounting to
$34.7 billion, was invested in startups with at least one female
co-founder. The AI sector, in particular, saw over 50% of its
investment going to companies with female founders, driven by
significant funding rounds raised by companies like OpenAI and
Anthropic. Despite this progress, the majority of funded AI startups
still lack female founders, and sustained efforts are needed to
support women entrepreneurs across all funding stages. 

 THE RISE OF AI AGENT INFRASTRUCTURE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The rapid development of GenAI apps is being driven by improving
models and platform infrastructure, but the pace of development means
that new requirements are constantly emerging. AI agents, which are
autonomous actors that can plan and execute multi-step tasks, are
becoming a common interface for end-users and a core abstraction for
developers. A rich ecosystem of AI agent infrastructure is emerging to
support the rise of AI agents, including agent-specific developer
tools, agents as a service, browser infrastructure, personalized
memory, authentication for agents, and managed hosting and
orchestration services.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY PRICING AND PACKAGING MATTERS MORE WHEN YOU'RE LAUNCHING YOUR
SECOND PRODUCT (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Launching new products is crucial for B2B companies to expand their
market and deepen customer relationships, but it requires finding
product-market fit again with a slimmer margin for error. Considering
pricing and packaging early on can help determine the viability of a
product idea and efficiently capture its value. When pricing a new
product, companies should revisit their pricing metric, segment their
current and potential customers, and assess customers' willingness to
pay to avoid common pitfalls and ensure a successful product launch. 

 HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR VOLUNTARY CHURN (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This guide explores how to measure, mitigate, and recover voluntary
churn. Voluntary churn, as opposed to involuntary churn, is when a
customer leaves your product on purpose. Most importantly, you need to
understand why they're churning. Is it price, product gaps, or they
simply don't need it anymore? Understanding why enables you to build
measures within your product to win them back‚Äìlike automatic
discounts, the ability to pause their subscription, or simply remind
them what they'd be missing out on. 

 DOING STUFF WITH AI (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI systems have become more capable and user-friendly in recent
months, offering a range of playful and serious applications. Large
language models like Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5, and GPT-4 now connect
to the internet, generate images, run code, analyze data, see images
and video, and work with documents. However, the rapid pace of AI
development means that even the most advanced models today may soon
become obsolete as new, smarter systems emerge.

 TIKTOK, ROBOTS, AND OPPORTUNITIES IN CONSUMERLAND! (17 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 While the common sentiment is that we're in a ‚Äúconsumer VC
winter‚Äù, there are still interesting sources of alpha for consumer
entrepreneurs & investors. This post explores how TikTok/Xiaohongshu's
product design and Roborock's commercialization culture have enabled

 PESSIMISM, POSITIONING, AND HOW TO BUILD A BETTER SALES PITCH (6
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Nailing your product positioning and sales pitch is make-or-break for
B2B growth. April Dunford, expert on both, shares her insights on
avoiding common traps and winning more deals. Buyers really want
market perspective and option navigation help. Teach them what to
value and prove you deliver it better than alternatives. Don't just
hope they figure it out. You can influence their decision criteria
more than you think. 

 BILLBOARDS ARE STILL OP (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Startups are increasingly turning to offline advertising methods like
billboards to boost brand awareness and complement their online
marketing efforts. While measuring the effectiveness of billboards can
be challenging, companies use various methods such as tracking signup
data, conducting surveys, and monitoring changes in website traffic to
gauge their impact.
