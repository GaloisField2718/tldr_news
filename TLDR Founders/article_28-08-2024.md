DEPLOY WITHOUT A DEVELOPER (SPONSOR) [4]

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 AFTER SLOWING IN 2023, US MEDIAN ROUND SIZE AGAIN GROWING (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 After a decline in 2023, the median size of funding rounds for
startups in the US has begun to increase again, particularly for seed
and Series A rounds. This growth is largely driven by investments in
artificial intelligence (AI) companies, which have seen valuations and
round sizes increase significantly. The trend suggests a renewed
optimism in the venture capital market, with investors seeking to back
high-growth and efficient companies, especially in the AI sector. 

 VERTICAL INTEGRATORS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A new generation of companies, known as Vertical Integrators, are
emerging in the tech industry. These companies are succeeding by
integrating multiple cutting-edge technologies and developing
significant in-house capabilities, rather than relying on aggregation
or software-only solutions. By embracing vertical integration, these
companies are able to create innovative systems that can compete with
incumbents and solve complex physical problems. 

 TOWARD A HORIZONTAL ROBOTICS PLATFORM (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The field of robotics is experiencing a surge in talent, capital, and
research, which could lead to the development of a horizontal robotics
platform that enables more developers to innovate in this field. This
platform would provide a common foundation for robotic intelligence,
allowing for the creation of more general and adaptable robots that
can perform a wide range of tasks. The emergence of such a platform
could revolutionize the field of robotics and enable the development
of intelligent machines that can interact with the physical world in a
more sophisticated way.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SEOZEMPIC: QUALITY OVER QUANTITY FOR GOOGLE INDEXING (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Recent changes in Google's indexing approach have been influenced by
the shrinking open web and the rise of content platforms built on
complex frameworks. Google's increased focus on domain quality means
that domains must demonstrate high-quality content to be indexed, as
low-quality content can lead to reduced visibility or indexing. This
shift requires SEOs to prioritize quality over quantity, implement
robust monitoring systems, and optimize existing content to maintain
or improve organic traffic. 

 UNDERSTANDING REVENUE GROWTH ENDURANCE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Revenue Growth Endurance is a metric used to evaluate how well a
company maintains its growth rate from year to year, despite an
increasing revenue base. It is calculated as the ratio of this year's
growth to last year's growth, with a higher percentage indicating
better endurance. Maintaining a high growth endurance is crucial for
reaching long-term revenue milestones and attracting investors, as it
reflects sustained market interest and customer retention. 

 MARKETING ATTRIBUTION: A GUIDED MAP FOR SUCCESS (12 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Marketing attribution is vital for startups to understand conversion
behavior and optimize growth strategies. Implement a three-step
process: event tracking, identity resolution, and attribution logic.
Begin with simple models like first-touch or ranked-touch,
prioritizing channels that matter most to your business. Regularly
test and refine your approach, focusing on key metrics such as user
signups or sales leads. Remember, attribution is an ongoing process,
not a set-and-forget solution.

 GUSTO FOUNDER JOSH REEVES SHARES ADVICE ON FUNDRAISING (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Josh Reeves, the founder of Gusto, shares valuable insights on
raising venture capital, emphasizing the importance of building strong
relationships with investors. He suggests treating fundraising like
hiring, and viewing investors as part of your team, and recommends
getting to know potential investors even when not actively seeking
funding. Additionally, Reeves advises entrepreneurs to consider
raising their seed round from strategic angels who can provide
valuable advice and connections. 

 MISSION AND VARIANCE (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Some companies prioritize their mission over financial gain, which
can lead to increased variance in their performance. This approach can
result in both significant losses and extraordinary successes,
especially when paired with economies of scale. By focusing on their
mission, these companies can attract better talent and create
innovative products, but they also face unique challenges and risks
that more conventional businesses do not.

across multiple environments. Cohere's CEO, Aidan Gomez, believes that

enterprise systems and automate work.
