HEADLINES & TRENDS

 VC-BACKED COMPANIES TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SLOW M&A MARKET (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 While Big Tech companies have dramatically pulled back on startup
acquisitions, VC-backed companies have stepped into the
void—accounting for over a third of all startup acquisitions in 2024
as they leverage their substantial war chests (29% of all US VC
funding) to drive growth through consolidation in a market where
traditional exits remain challenging and company valuations are
depressed. 

 KLARNA IPO: S1 BREAKDOWN (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Klarna is going public at a $15-20B valuation—down dramatically
from its $46B peak—after turning its first small annual profit of
$21M on $2.8B in revenue. The Swedish fintech giant built a massive
customer base through its "buy now, pay later" model, funding
purchases with $9.5B in consumer deposits thanks to its banking
license. While US revenue grew 39% last year, rising credit losses
($495M) and material weaknesses in financial controls raise serious
questions. The company is transitioning from pure BNPL into a broader
commerce platform with growing advertising revenue, but investors must
decide if Klarna is truly a tech platform or just a consumer lender
with better marketing. 

 HOW WORRIED SHOULD WE BE ABOUT THE ECONOMY? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The economic outlook is getting worse as multiple problems hit at
once: consumers can't keep spending more than they earn, job markets
are weaker than they appear, businesses are holding back on
investments because of trade uncertainty, tech spending is slowing
down, and government spending at state and local levels is dropping
off—all creating conditions where unemployment could rise
significantly even if we don't enter an official recession.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO DISPLACE AN EXISTING VENDOR (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 When prospects say "we're locked in a contract," smart salespeople
see an opportunity rather than a dead end. The winning strategy starts
with confirming genuine pain exists and finding the decision-maker who
feels it most acutely. Don't offer cash buyouts—instead, help them
downgrade their existing service while introducing yours, or create
credits that match their remaining payments. This approach helps
decision-makers look smart rather than wrong about their previous
choice and turns "call me at renewal" into a business you can close
today. 

 WHY YOU SHOULD CONSIDER TALKING TO NON-USERS FOR UX RESEARCH (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The incorporation of non-user research alongside traditional user
research enhances product development by offering insights into market
competition, acquisition strategies, and audience behavior. Engaging
with non-users helps identify competitive alternatives and improve
marketing channels - heavy users provide valuable feedback on
usability and satisfaction. Balancing 70% of research on users and 30%
on non-users can yield a comprehensive understanding of both current
and potential market opportunities. 

 10 STARTUPS TO WATCH FROM Y COMBINATOR'S W25 DEMO DAY (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Y Combinator's Winter 2025 Demo Day highlighted startups that focused
on AI-enhancing tools rather than creating new AI agents. Standouts
included Abundant for agent teleoperation, Browser Use for AI web
navigation, and GradeWiz for automating tedious grading tasks with AI.
Other notable startups were Pickle for Zoom call avatars and Misprint,
a Pokémon card trading platform.

 HOW TO BUILD YOUR OWN SOFTWARE WITH AI (NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY) (6
MINUTE READ) [13]

tools like ChatGPT for personalized software development, even without

 AUTHENTICATION IN THE AGE OF AI AGENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI agents are getting better at automating tasks in browsers and on
desktops, but they face a roadblock: how do they log into websites and
apps? This authentication challenge creates opportunities for startups
to build new solutions that let AI helpers work smoothly across
systems while keeping user credentials safe and secure. 

 BUILDING THE AI NATIVE COMPANY (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI is no longer just a feature—it's becoming the foundation of how
companies operate. Veteran founders are completely reimagining their
businesses with artificial intelligence driving everything from sales
calls to customer support. The market is validating this shift
too—ServiceNow just dropped $2.85B to acquire Moveworks, while a new
AI agent called Manus is turning heads by handling complex tasks that
previously required specialized tools.
