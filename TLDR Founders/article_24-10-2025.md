HEADLINES & TRENDS

 OPENAI ACQUIRES SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS INCORPORATED, MAKER OF SKY (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI acquired Software Applications Incorporated, the creator of
Sky, a natural language interface for macOS. This acquisition aims to
integrate Sky's capabilities into ChatGPT, enhancing AI functionality
across user applications. The entire Software Applications team will
join OpenAI to advance this integration. 

 DAVID TISCH'S BOXGROUP RAISES $550 MILLION ACROSS TWO NEW FUNDS AS
VENTURE FIRM CROSSES 16 YEARS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 BoxGroup, led by David Tisch, raised $550 million across two new
funds, focusing on early-stage and follow-on investments. The firm
adopts a collaborative approach, participating in numerous early-stage
rounds alongside other VCs, building an impressive portfolio including
Ramp and Stripe. Tisch emphasizes flexibility in sector and geography,
aiming to maintain relevance despite growing competition for LP
funding. 

 WHY AI CANNOT SIMULATE YOUR CUSTOMERS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new study claims AI can mimic customer purchase intent with 90
percent accuracy. Impressive on paper, but founders should be
cautious. Models can mirror how people talk about buying, not how they
actually buy. Real decisions happen inside context: risk, politics,
switching costs, and emotion. AI can help generate hypotheses, but
strategy still starts in messy, human conversations. You don't find
differentiators in data, you find them in people.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PRODUCT-MARKET FIT IS NO LONGER STATIC (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI's rapid advancements have made product-market fit (PMF) a
continually shifting target. Companies must frequently re-establish
PMF as evolving capabilities demand real-time adjustments and
feedback. This dynamic environment fuels the need for more engineers
directly engaging with customers. 

 HOW FLUENTLY HIT $5M ARR WITH $0 AD SPEND (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Fluently scaled from $48K to $5M ARR in a year by treating short-form
video like a data experiment, not a creative gamble. In 200 days, it
pulled over a billion views across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts,
and Facebook Reels without buying ads. It posted 2–3 videos daily
through dozens of small creators, studied which hooks worked, then
remade top performers fast with new faces. Every video was tracked
with UTM links from view to revenue, cutting what didn't convert.
Consistency, fast iteration, and measurement replaced big budgets and
built one of the fastest UGC growth engines in SaaS. 

 HOW TO BUILD AI PRODUCTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOOD (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Making AI work in production takes more than clever prompts. When
thousands of users interact with a model, every mistake – wrong
tone, bad data, off response – multiplies fast. That's why companies
now rely on “evals,” systems that test and score models the same
way engineers test code. Tools like Braintrust let teams log real user
inputs, compare outputs against expected answers, and continuously
tune models based on results. It's how Notion, Ramp, and Stripe keep
AI features reliable as they scale.

 WHAT EARLY STAGE FOUNDERS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT COMP (5 MINUTE READ) [14]


 Early-stage founders don't need Google-style compensation systems.
What you need is something simple enough to explain in five minutes
and fair enough that no one questions it. Start by defining your
philosophy: how much cash versus equity, how transparent you'll be,
and what principles guide every decision. This foundation matters
because you'll use it to justify every offer you make. From there, the
math is straightforward. Pay people fairly but not lavishly, since the
real upside is equity. Keep your first ten hires under 10% of the
total pool so you have room to grow, then calibrate by role: sales
earns on revenue, customer success on retention, product on outcomes.
When someone proves their impact, reward them immediately. 

 HOW PALO ALTO + CYBERARK COULD RESHAPE IDENTITY SECURITY (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Palo Alto's $25B deal for CyberArk is more than another big
cybersecurity acquisition—it's a signal that identity is becoming
the center of enterprise defense. CyberArk has long been the go-to for
protecting the most powerful accounts inside companies, while Palo
Alto built its reputation securing networks and clouds. Together, they
can turn identity into the main line of defense, deciding who gets
access, when, and under what conditions. The hard part will be keeping
CyberArk's trusted focus intact as Palo Alto folds it into a much
larger platform. 

 EVE RAISES $103 MILLION AT $1 BILLION VALUATION TO HELP PLAINTIFF
FIRMS DELIVER JUSTICE THROUGH AI TRANSFORMATION (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Eve raised $103 million in Series B funding, led by Spark Capital,
reaching a $1 billion valuation. The AI platform now serves over 450
law firms, processing 200,000 legal cases annually and assisting in
recovering over $3.5 billion in settlements. Eve's rapidly growing
legal AI platform aims to reimagine plaintiff firms' operations by
enhancing efficiency and scaling case capacity.
