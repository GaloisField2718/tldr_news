STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 METRIC TO KNOW BEFORE YOUR NEXT INVESTOR MEETING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Getting caught out and not knowing something important when an

things you should have top of mind before you do your regular sync

 TIPS FOR BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL HARDWARE COMPANY (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Software has a lot of playbooks by now, hardware doesn‚Äôt.

founder can position themselves to build a successful hardware
company.

 THE PITFALLS OF PATTERN RECOGNITION (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ‚ÄúWe tried that before‚Äù. Everyone knows that phrase at a startup,
right? It‚Äôs true - if you hear hooves it‚Äôs likely a horse - but
sometimes it‚Äôs a zebra. Relying on pattern recognition to make
decisions can only get you so far. Here are some tactics on how to
make sure you‚Äôre not wrongly relying on defaults. 

 VERTICAL AI (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Horizontal software, software designed to solve a user's pain
regardless of the type of user that feels it, has defined the last 10
years of SaaS. Vertical SaaS, by contrast, is designed for a single or
narrow user set, enabling the solution to be tailored to their needs.
In this article, a Greylock partner forecasts that moving forward,
users‚Äô expectations around tailored services will govern how we
build software. 

 WHY STABILITY AI IS LAUNCHING A SUBSCRIPTION FEE (6 MINUTE READ) [15]

straws to be relevant amid an ever-changing roadmap and vision. Open
source one day, and not the next. It‚Äôs a sure way to lose everything
when you don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúthing‚Äù.
