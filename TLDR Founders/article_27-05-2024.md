 CAN'T KEEP UP WITH CUSTOMER INTEGRATION REQUESTS? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Customers expect your product to have integrations [4] more than ever
today. They're table stakes, even for early-stage SaaS companies, and
even more so if you offer AI features.

But, each integration takes months of engineering [4]to build, and you
need your team to focus on core product features.

Solutions like Embedded iPaaS and Unified APIs exist to streamline
development, but should you use them? This guide [4] covers all the
factors you should consider. Read it here [4].

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 SEED IS BROKEN AND HERE'S HOW TO FIX IT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The term "Seed" in startup funding has become ambiguous, encompassing
a wide range of funding amounts and company stages, making it harder
for young startups to meet higher expectations and advance to Series
A. To provide clarity, categorize Seed funding into two distinct
stages: "Seed Inception" for initial funding and early product
development, and "Seed Expansion" for startups with traction focusing
on iteration and go-to-market testing. 

 HEALTH AND BIOTECH STARTUPS RECEIVED MAJORITY SERIES A FUNDING (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Biotech and healthcare startups are dominating U.S. Series A funding
in 2024, accounting for 53% of total commitments despite representing
less than a third of deals. These sectors are attracting the largest
Series A rounds, with six out of the top ten financings going to
biotechs, including supergiant rounds for Xaira Therapeutics and
Mirador Therapeutics. As biotech and healthcare capture a growing
share of Series A investment, there are concerns about the
availability of funding for startups in other sectors, particularly
those that raised seed funding during the recent record-breaking
period. 

 QUICK CHECK ON THE CAUTIOUS CONSUMER (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Consumer spending has been relatively flat or slightly declining in
recent months, with lower-income consumers particularly slowing their
spending. E-commerce continues to drive growth, while discretionary
spending on travel, entertainment, and dining out is sliding. The
current consumer behavior could be a return to normal, but it remains
uncertain how long this cautious spending trend will persist.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO FIND MORE CUSTOMERS ON LINKEDIN (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Setting up Google Alerts for relevant industry news and milestones
can help identify potential customers who are in a growth phase.
Crafting a simple, non-aggressive, and intriguing cold DM template
that focuses on the prospect's achievements and your relevant
experience can be an effective way to start a conversation. Scheduling
a weekly outreach session to send these DMs can lead to a significant
pipeline of potential clients with minimal effort. 

 PLAYING TO WIN VERSUS PLAYING TO MAKE PLAN (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article discusses two different strategic approaches in the
Silicon Valley software industry: "playing to win" and "playing to
make plan". The former focuses on dominating a market and delivering
significant returns to investors, while the latter aims to achieve
steady growth and profitability targets. Companies should identify
which approach they are taking and align their strategies, hiring
practices, and operations accordingly to maximize their chances of
success. 

 TERMS TO WATCH IN AN LOI (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 An acquirer interested in purchasing your business should provide a
detailed offer that covers key aspects such as the purchase price,
financing sources, management retention, and due diligence
requirements. The offer should also address indemnification,
transaction timing, and necessary approvals to ensure a smooth and
efficient acquisition process. Failing to clearly understand and agree
upon these core components upfront can lead to costly legal battles
and jeopardize the successful completion of the deal.

 WHY ARE MOMMY AND DADDY FIGHTING ABOUT AI? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 People often seek individuality and non-conformity, but their beliefs
