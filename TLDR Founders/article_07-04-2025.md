HEADLINES & TRENDS

 SURGING TRADE DEFICIT LIKELY TO REVERSE IN MONTHS AHEAD (4 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The US trade deficit hit near-record levels in February (-$123B) as
businesses rushed imports before new tariffs took effect. This surge
is likely temporary - once tariffs are implemented, expect a big
reversal as higher prices dampen demand for foreign goods. For
startups, this economic shift presents both challenges and
opportunities: supply chains will face disruption and imported
components will become more expensive, potentially creating inflation
pressure across sectors. 

 DID WE JUST EXPERIENCE A "BEFORE, AND AFTER" DAY? (6 MINUTE READ) [5]


 New tariffs triggered a $1.8 trillion one-day loss in global
equities—compressing SaaS multiples below 5x for only the third time
in a decade and potentially creating a "before and after" moment for
the economy. Even tech companies selling digital products face ripple
effects as customers who move physical goods tighten budgets, leading
to slower procurement cycles, deferred renewals, and extended
diligence periods for deals. The playbook for operators: avoid hiring
ahead of plan or signing multi-year contracts, review budgets monthly
instead of quarterly, track pipeline exposure to non-tech customers,
and communicate transparently with employees about what's happening. 

 KLARNA AND STUBHUB DELAY IPOS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 High-profile IPOs from fintech Klarna and ticket marketplace StubHub
have been paused following market turmoil caused by Trump's new
tariffs. Both startups aimed to raise over $1 billion but delayed
investor roadshows as public markets tumbled.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE 25-DAY PLAN TO REVIVE CLOSED-LOST OPPORTUNITIES (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Lost deals aren't dead forever - they're often just waiting for the
right moment to reopen. First, understand why each opportunity died
through CRM data or call recordings, then watch for triggers like new
decision-makers, funding rounds, or changing business needs that make
timing right. When ready, execute a structured 25-day outreach: start
with day 1's triple-touch across LinkedIn, phone, and email, then
progress through educational content about new features on day 6,
expand to other buying committee members by day 8, send personalized
video demos by day 15, and finish with an open-ended goodbye that
keeps the door ajar for when they inevitably return to the market. 

 SOMETIMES NEVER COMPETE ON PRICE (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The difference between failing "low price" strategies and wildly
successful ones like Amazon, Costco, Southwest, and Vanguard isn't
just charging less - it's creating a comprehensive strategic system
where "low price" emerges naturally from deliberate trade-offs. These
companies didn't just cut margins. Instead, they built unique business
models with intentional weaknesses that competitors couldn't copy. 

 OFFENSIVE VS. DEFENSIVE DATA ANALYSIS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most startups treat analytics like firefighting—only analyzing data
when metrics break. Instead, founders should shift to proactive
"offensive analysis," regularly identifying what's working, why, and
how to amplify it, turning insights into strategic growth initiatives.
To embed more “offense” into your culture, reserve dedicated team
time weekly, elevate data teams as strategic partners, and
intentionally celebrate proactive wins.
