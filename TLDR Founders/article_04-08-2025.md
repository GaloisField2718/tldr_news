 Your new hire checklist probably looks something like this:
paperwork, onboarding plan, email setup… 401(K)?!?

compliant and help keep your employees happy. And with Guideline

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WILL APPLE BUY MISTRAL? (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple might acquire Mistral, a French AI company, to enhance its AI
capabilities and counter Big Tech rivals. Speculation arises as
Mistral faces challenges competing with US giants like OpenAI and
Anthropic. However, possible regulatory hurdles and Mistral's desire
for independence may complicate the acquisition. 

 WELCOME TO THE $4 TRILLION CLUB (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft's valuation hit $4 trillion after reporting Q2 earnings
with $76.4 billion in revenue and strong cloud growth, marking it as
the second company to reach this milestone. Meta's stock surged nearly
12% pre-market following its Q2 report, highlighting substantial
revenue growth driven by its AI investments and expansive capex plans
for 2025. Ambiq and Figma's IPOs showed strong market demand, with
Figma reaching a $33 per-share debut valuation near $20 billion. 

 ALL HAIL THE DEMISE OF ADOBE-FIGMA (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Adobe tried to buy Figma for $20 billion in 2022, double its private
valuation, in what looked like a classic incumbent squashing a
competitor. The deal fell apart under regulatory scrutiny. Fast
forward to this week - Figma went public at $55 billion, nearly triple
what Adobe offered. The math on who won: Figma's backers went from
almost selling at $20 billion to holding shares worth $55 billion,
Figma got a $1 billion breakup fee from Adobe, and customers get
actual competition instead of another Adobe monopoly.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHERE TO FIND IDEAS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A Harvard Business School graduate became an EMT for $15 an hour just
to understand how emergency services really worked - and that's
exactly how he found his startup idea. Another founder wanted to build
software for greenhouses, so instead of scheduling interviews with
greenhouse owners, he just bought one and ran it himself. These
founders understood something most people miss - you can't discover
real startup ideas through discovery interviews and whiteboard
sessions. You need to actually become your customer. 

 NEW MEDIA, LEGACY MEDIA & HOW TO DO FOUNDER PR (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The founder of a PR agency that's worked with Perplexity and Ramp
would turn down the Wall Street Journal for Lenny's Podcast - and she
has a point. Emilie Gerber from Six Eastern explained that a
one-sentence WSJ mention would do nothing while 60 minutes on a
podcast actually drives customers. After working with over 100 tech
companies, she's learned that most PR pitches fail because they make
the company the center of the universe instead of a lens for
understanding bigger trends. 

 WHY YOUR PITCH DOESN'T WORK (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Pitch failures often stem from delivering what you want rather than
what your audience needs. Emphasize unique differentiators instead of
personal achievements, as audiences care about what sets you apart.
Ensure memorability to influence decisions made after your pitch.

Snowflake gets the balance right. Read the blog [11]

MISCELLANEOUS

 CAN ANALYSIS EVER BE AUTOMATED? (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Four charts about internet usage sit in front of you - one made by a
Nobel laureate, one by ChatGPT, one pulled from Reddit, and one
cobbled together in ten minutes. There's no way to tell which is
correct without checking every formula and data source yourself.
That's the catch-22 of automated analysis - unlike vibe-coded apps,
where bugs eventually surface, you can't test if a chart "works" just
by looking at it. Shortcut claims its AI can solve Financial Modeling
World Cup problems and build cap tables in minutes, but how do you
trust it? There's no reality to compare it against because the
spreadsheet IS reality. 

 ARE ADVISORS WORTH THE DILUTION? (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A Figma advisor who joined after the seed round might have just made
$65 million from their IPO for maybe a few hours of work per month.
The math is brutal - advisors typically get 0.11% equity at seed
stage, vesting over 2 years instead of the standard 4 for employees,
plus single-trigger acceleration on exits. Most CEOs hire advisors
then forget about them. 90% of advisors aren't worth it - they take
similar dilution to a VP-level hire but only give you an hour per
week. 

 WILL DATA CENTERS CRASH THE ECONOMY? (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Big Tech is spending $102.5 billion per quarter on AI data centers -
more than all consumer spending contributed to GDP growth last quarter
- and the scary part is how they're financing it. This looks eerily
similar to the telecom bubble of 2000, except with one crucial
difference: this time, banks are involved. Private credit funds, which
barely existed a decade ago, are borrowing from banks to lend to data
center companies, creating the exact kind of opaque debt chain that
triggered 2008. If AI revenue doesn't materialize fast enough to pay
back these loans, the correlations are high - they'll all default at
once.

 NOT ALL GROWTH IS CREATED EQUAL (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AI companies are hitting $100M ARR in under a year, but some of those
stories unravel just as fast - growth spikes, customers churn, the
business deflates. 

 THREE DEFINITIONS OF RISK (AND WHY IT MATTERS) (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The classic definition of risk treats it as volatility, but imagine
being offered a stock that either gains you $100 or $1,000,000 -
technically high volatility, but zero actual risk since you win either
way.
