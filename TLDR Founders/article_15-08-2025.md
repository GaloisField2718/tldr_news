HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE STATE OF AI 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI startups are growing like nothing we've ever seen - some hit $100M
ARR in their first year. Bessemer studied 20 companies and found two
types: Supernovas that explode to $125M by year two but have 25% gross
margins and fragile retention, and Shooting Stars that quadruple
yearly with 60% margins. The new benchmark isn't T2D3 anymore, it's
Q2T3 (quadruple, quadruple, triple, triple, triple). 

 COHERE RAISES $500M AT $6.8B VALUATION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cohere secured $500 million in an oversubscribed round led by Radical
Ventures and Inovia Capital, propelled to a $6.8 billion valuation.
The company added Joelle Pineau (former Meta AI research lead) as
Chief AI Officer and Francois Chadwick (ex-Uber) as CFO. Cohere will
invest in agentic AI tools like North, designed to automate enterprise
workflows, while maintaining a security-first, on-premises deployment
approach. 

 JACK DORSEY: I THINK OF THE CEO ROLE AS "CHIEF EDITOR" OF THE COMPANY
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Jack Dorsey runs Square like a magazine editor - thousands of ideas
flood in from engineers, support, and designers, but only one or two
really push the company forward. The CEO's job is to review everything
and cut ruthlessly.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR PLAYBOOK TO FORECASTING PIPELINE AT SCALE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Rubrik hit $1 billion ARR with a forecasting process that starts five
days before executives see numbers. Wednesday: reps validate every
deal with managers. Monday: the CRO digs into each opportunity.
Friday: C-suite gets a forecast that's been pressure-tested multiple
times. It marks deals as "in-path" (leadership believes it) or
"out-of-path" (risky). When a rep commits a deal but their manager
disagrees, that's an automatic investigation. Quotas come from actual
data - Rubrik calculates exactly how many calls turn into meetings or
deals, so reps believe their targets are achievable. The company
forces sales, marketing, and finance into weekly accountability forums
where nobody can dodge revenue questions. 

 TIME TO EXIT: ARE STARTUPS GETTING OLDER? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Startups are taking longer to exit, with the median age at IPO now at
13.5 years due to increased private capital availability, market
pressures, and a focus on profitability. This trend results in longer
holding periods for investors, a shift towards later-stage investing,
and more emphasis on secondary sales for liquidity. Investors may
adapt by extending fund lifecycles, diversifying investment stages,
and prioritizing sustainable growth. 

 ALIGNING PRODUCT AND GO-TO-MARKET WITH METRICS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Dan Teodosiu and a fellow Balderton Capital EIR discuss aligning
product and go-to-market teams using customer-value metrics. The
article outlines historical examples where companies faltered by
neglecting customer value. It encourages leaders to focus on why
customers would repeatedly choose their product.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT DO YOU MEAN? (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 We all use the same words, but mean completely different things. Your
engineer says the feature is "done" (it's not deployed). Your designer
says it's "done" (first draft). Your co-founder calls the new strategy
"risky" (exciting!). You hear "risky" (we're gonna die). This stuff
kills startups. One person's "by end of day" is 5 pm, another's is
midnight. One founder's "love" for the company means 60-hour weeks,
the other's means sustainable passion. The fix is stupidly simple:
just define your terms. What does "shipped" mean at your company?
What's "good enough"? 

 WHEN BUILDING GETS EASY, WINNING GETS HARD (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sam Altman says we're entering the "fast fashion era of SaaS," and
he's right. AI split software into two camps - the hard builds like
infrastructure and foundation models, and the easy builds you can ship
in a weekend with Cursor. When building gets easy, winning gets
exponentially harder because everyone has the same product. The margin
reality is brutal. Replit swings between -14% and +36% gross margins,
while OpenAI sits at 45% and Nvidia at 75%. 

 THE RED QUEEN EFFECT - MENTAL MODEL: WORK SMARTER, NOT FASTER (4
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Red Queen told Alice she must run twice as fast just to get
anywhere because in Wonderland, running at full speed only keeps you
in the same place. This perfectly describes startups that chase every
AI update and framework just to avoid falling behind. Teams exhaust
themselves implementing every new tool while competitors do the same,
so nobody actually pulls ahead. We're so busy keeping up that we
forget to ask if we're running in the right direction. Three questions
cut through the panic: Are you making real progress or just matching
competitors? Why are you moving in this direction? What would actually
happen if you paused?
