 TLDR FOUNDERS 2025-02-19

 AUTH FOR FOUNDERS WHO DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT AUTH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 PropelAuth is based on the idea that a great auth product gets out of
your way. This means you have everything you need out of the box [4]:

✅ Easy integration and straightforward APIs for developers.

✅ Built-in user management for customer-facing teams.

✅ Data and insights for PMs and executives.

Instead of constantly taking your developers out of flow for things
like password resets or user management, PropelAuth lets you do things
yourself [4] — so those regular nags become one-time requests.

And your software stays secure with fully-featured, modern auth [4]:
organizations, SSO, RBAC, and more.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 AIRBNB 4Q24 BUSINESS UPDATE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This post highlights Airbnb's accelerating revenue growth (+12% YoY)
alongside a small margin drop due to fresh product investments. The
gist is that they're pouring money into new features and global
traction is paying off; free cash flow remains strong, so investors
see a balanced mix of near-term execution and long-term ambition. 

 GROK 3: ANOTHER WIN FOR THE BITTER LESSON (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 xAI's new Grok 3 model—trained at a huge scale—has vaulted to
state-of-the-art territory. This leap underscores a “bitter
lesson” in machine learning: more compute and data often beat
smaller, clever hacks. While some point to streamlined approaches like
DeepSeek as an alternative, raw scale still wins long term. Once
again, bigger clusters and massive training runs seem to outpace all
else. 

 IBM'S $7B BET ON VERTICAL AI AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR SAAS FOUNDERS (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 IBM invests $7 billion in Vertical AI, focusing on industry-specific
solutions through its WatsonX platform. The approach targets economic
efficiencies, leveraging smaller models like Instruct Lab for
significant cost and time savings. Strategic partnerships with firms
like ServiceNow and Salesforce aim to accelerate enterprise AI
adoption, offering SaaS founders new opportunities for domain-specific
innovation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DID YOU KNOW… “WHEN YOU CARE ENOUGH TO SEND THE VERY BEST” (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hallmark's famous tagline is dissected as a masterclass in emotional
marketing. By tying greeting cards to a sense of genuine caring,
Hallmark turned what could be a mundane commodity into an emotional
must-have for any “important” occasion. Founders can learn from
how Hallmark uses social norms, trigger events (like birthdays or
holidays), and subtle fear-of-regret messaging to make card-giving
feel essential. 

 WHY YOU, WHY US, WHY US TOGETHER (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A simple formula for founders when making an offer to a key
candidate: clarify why that person is uniquely suited for the role,
why your company stands out for them, and why combining forces creates
an extra spark. It suggests drafting a short “three reasons” memo
to accompany any job offer, ensuring mutual alignment is explicit.
This tactic aims to strengthen trust right from the get-go. 

 HOW TO MASTER SOFTWARE RELEASE CYCLES IN 2025 (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Velocity is becoming a key metric in DevOps, with top performers like
Amazon and Netflix excelling in rapid release cycles. Traditional
enterprises struggle with slower cycles due to rigid structures,
impacting their competitiveness. Improving velocity requires smarter
resource allocation and leveraging data for insights into
inefficiencies.

 OUTCOME ORIENTATION AS A CURE FOR INFORMATION OVERLOAD (6 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Manage perpetual info overwhelm not by blocking every new source, but
by staying crystal clear on what outcome you want from any article,
video, or conversation. If you're just reading the news or listening
to a podcast for “no reason,” you'll spiral into a flood of noise.
When you tie your consumption to a specific goal, you'll naturally
filter out the extra and keep your mental space tidy.

survive past the startup phase, highlighting the importance of product
validation. Product validation helps startups assess demand, reduce
risk, and save resources before product launch. Key steps include
