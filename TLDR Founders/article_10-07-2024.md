HEADLINES & TRENDS

 AI STARTUP HEBBIA RAISES $130M AT A $700M VALUATION (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 An example of the high valuations being assigned to AI startups,
Hebbia has raised $130 million at a $700 million valuation on $13
million ARR. Hebbia's main product, Matrix, can analyze large
documents and respond to user inquiries in a spreadsheet-like format.
It is currently used by 30% of asset managers for research purposes.
The company plans to use the fresh funding to expand its team and
offerings to other industries, such as law firms and pharmaceutical
companies. 

 SO YOU WANT TO START A SAAS COMPANY? (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Starting a SaaS company in 2024 is challenging due to the dominance
of incumbents, high switching costs, and a saturated market. Tech
sales is also undergoing a transformation, with buyer trust at an
all-time low and traditional engagement methods becoming less
effective. However, startups still have opportunities to succeed by
leveraging the latest technology, rethinking business models, and
exploring new strategies like the ‚ÄúCompound Startup‚Äù approach. 

 HOW CLOSE IS AI TO REPLACING PRODUCT MANAGERS? (29 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A professional prompt engineer and a product manager teamed up to
test how well AI could perform difficult product management tasks
compared to humans. They found that with expert prompting, AI was able
to match or even outperform human responses in tasks like developing
product strategy, defining performance metrics, and estimating ROI.
The results suggest that AI is rapidly advancing and may be able to
automate significant portions of product management work in the near
future, though humans still have an edge in certain areas like
strategic thinking and incorporating unique insights.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TOP B2B COMPANIES GOT THEIR FIRST 100 CUSTOMERS (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 This article looks at the strategies that successful B2B SaaS
companies like Retool, Amplitude, Hubspot, Brex, Gusto, Rippling,
Loom, and Typeform used to acquire their first 100 customers. Common
themes among these companies include focusing on a narrow target
market, building an MVP based on customer feedback, and leveraging
personal networks and communities for early traction. Many of these
companies also relied on a sales-led approach, with founders directly
engaging in customer conversations to validate their product
hypotheses and iterate on pricing and features. 

 WHAT COUNTS AS A CUSTOMER? (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Companies are becoming more liberal in defining what constitutes a
customer, partly due to the adoption of PLG strategies and usage-based
pricing. When analyzing a company, it's best to start with the
position that anyone who paid within the last 12 months is a customer
and then work backwards from there, as there are incentives for
companies to exclude certain groups of users to improve metrics such
as churn, net dollar retention rate, and average deal size. 

 3 MISTAKES WHEN SETTING UP B2B REFERRALS ‚Äî AND HOW TO AVOID THEM (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Financially incentivized referral programs often fail for B2B
companies due to incorrect pricing expectations, lack of organic
word-of-mouth growth, and a transactional approach to users. To
succeed, companies should offer meaningful incentives, build a
foundation of genuine user advocacy, and connect with customers
authentically to inspire them to refer others.

 HOW FIVE DYSFUNCTIONS ARE RUINING TEAMS AND COMPANIES (10 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Conflicts at work can be beneficial when focused on solving problems
rather than blaming or judging people. Building trust, being open to
respectful disagreements, ensuring commitment, promoting
accountability, and focusing on team results are key to overcoming
dysfunctions in teams and organizations. Meetings provide a great
opportunity to observe and address these dysfunctions. 

 YOUR PRICING PAGE HAS ONE JOB (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A well-designed pricing page is crucial for SaaS businesses as it
enables buyers to estimate their costs both today and in the future.
To achieve this, the pricing page should clearly present the available
options, convey how pricing works and what's included, and display the
prices that determine the monthly or annual cost. Simpler pricing
models tend to outperform more complex ones and can shape a positive
perception of the company and product. 

 THE VR WINTER CONTINUES (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Despite the current hype around generative AI, many of the technology
and business trends from late 2022 are still relevant and progressing.
Virtual and augmented reality devices are improving in terms of price,
specs, and capabilities, but have not yet achieved mass-market
product-market fit, with only a small percentage of people using VR
headsets daily. While the future potential of extended reality (xR)
technologies is exciting, it remains uncertain how large of a role
they will ultimately play.
