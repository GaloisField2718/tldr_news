 HOW WILL YOUR PRODUCT KEEP UP WITH THE INTEGRATIONS NEEDED FOR AI?
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Context & interoperability is critical when building AI products -
they must:

	* Ingest [5] or query external data for RAG (from knowledge bases,
CRMs, ticketing etc.)
 	* Automate work across users' other tools agentic actions [6] (with
tool calling)

But these integrations are expensive to build and maintain, even with
a dedicated integrations engineering team.

That's why enterprise AI companies like You.com, Appsmith, and AI21
use Paragon [4], so their engineers can focus on core product features
while still shipping the integrations customers need.

P.S. They just launched ActionKit [7] - a single API to give your AI
agents hundreds of integration actions

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 REVISITING COMPETITIVE MOATS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Placing all your bets on a single standout feature or a massive R&D
budget isn't a safe long-term strategy. In fast-moving markets, real
defensibility comes from constant iteration and genuine user focus. A
moat isn't built once—it's a habit of out-learning and out-improving
the competition. 

 MAKE SOMETHING HEAVY (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Quick posts and viral hits might be exhilarating, but they don't
always leave a lasting mark. Founders and creators should invest in
deep, substantial projects—a product with real staying power or a
well-researched piece of content—that can resonate far beyond a
short burst of online buzz. 

 THE END OF YC (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 When coding becomes cheap and easy, do engineer-founders still have
the biggest edge? With AI lowering the barrier to building MVPs, deep
domain expertise could trump raw coding power. Accelerators might
shift their focus to founders who truly grasp a market's pain
points—because assembling a prototype isn't the hard part anymore.
It's understanding what's worth building in the first place.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO BUILD A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SALES CULTURE WITHOUT BURNING OUT
YOUR TEAM (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 If you think cranking out big Q4 numbers always means overworked
reps, think again. You can stack wins while keeping your team sane by
hiring leaders who balance accountability with genuine support,
setting fair quotas, and celebrating progress—not just closed deals.
It's about making sure your top performers don't flame out. 

 HOW TO BUILD A WORLD-CLASS CUSTOMER SUCCESS MACHINE: TOP LESSONS FROM
THE CRO OF NOTION AND VP OF CS AT GITHUB (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Customer Success is evolving from a support role to a strategic
growth engine, with an emphasis on metrics like onboarding velocity
and product adoption rates. Key leaders like Erica Anderson of Notion
and Abbas Haider Ali of GitHub highlight the importance of structuring
and investing in Customer Success as a growth catalyst, recommending
10% of revenue as a benchmark. Effective team structures and a strong
CRO-CCO relationship are crucial for scaling and optimizing customer
engagement. 

 LEAVING DELAWARE (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Companies are reconsidering incorporating in Delaware due to
increasing court unpredictability, favoring Nevada and Texas for their
stable legal environments. High-profile firms like SpaceX and Tesla
have shifted to Texas, with Dropbox and TripAdvisor moving to Nevada.
This trend intersects with broader corporate relocations seeking
favorable business conditions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BRAIN DRAIN (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Excessive reliance on AI tools can sap critical thinking and
creativity by short-circuiting human problem-solving. Researchers are
discovering that when people delegate too much to
algorithms—especially with minimal skepticism—they risk losing
vital mental habits. 

 THE HIDDEN COST OF BEING PERFECT (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Obsessing over tiny improvements might feel productive, but it drains
time, energy, and your creative spark for minimal returns. Know when
“done” is good enough, so you can pour your attention into fresh,
higher-impact projects. Sometimes your best move is to shrug and move
on. 

 EARLY-STAGE VC IN THE AGE OF VERTICAL AI (5 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Founders with deep sector knowledge can now stand toe-to-toe with big
players, thanks to vertical AI cutting both costs and time-to-market.
You can reach real revenue fast by weaving AI into your industry's
most pressing problems. The catch? Once you solve the first big pain
point, you've got to keep innovating or risk stalling out. Investors
are shifting their approach, too, since these specialized AI upstarts
can find traction far quicker than the old model predicted.
