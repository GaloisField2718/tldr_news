HEADLINES & TRENDS

 FORMER CRUISE CEO KYLE VOGT'S NEW ROBOTICS STARTUP REPORTEDLY RAISES
ANOTHER $150M (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Bot Company, co-founded by former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt, raised
$150M in a Greenoaks-led round to develop robots for household chores.
The startup launched in May with initial funding from prominent tech
figures. This follows Vogt's resignation from Cruise after a
pedestrian incident involving a self-driving car. 

 AI COMPANY ACCUSED OF FRAUD? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TechCrunch's accusations against AI SDR company 11x point to startup
metric problems rather than clear fraud. Counting canceled contracts
as ARR and displaying unauthorized logos appears problematic, but
likely stems from poor processes rather than deliberate
deception—especially with both lead investors publicly defending the
company. 

 THE DOWNFALL OF 23ANDME'S BILLION-DOLLAR BET (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 23andMe's journey from biotech darling to bankruptcy reveals the
fatal flaws of building on novelty. Despite reaching a $6 billion
valuation with its popular DNA testing kits, the company's business
model collapsed due to four critical failures: its product was a
one-time purchase with no repeat customers, a devastating 2023 data
breach exposed 7 million users' genetic information, unclear privacy
policies eroded consumer trust, and its attempted pivot to
therapeutics failed to deliver a viable second act.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EVERYTHING I LEARNED RAISING MY FIRST PRE-SEED ROUND (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Raising a pre-seed round demands both strategy and mental toughness.
After 100+ investor meetings in just 10 days, George Matelich found
that thorough preparation is essential, founder intros are gold, and
scheduling meetings close together creates momentum that turns into
deals. The process involves many rejections, occasional elitist
attitudes, and the reality that many "pre-seed" funds actually expect
traction—making it crucial to position yourself as selecting
partners rather than seeking handouts. 

 KEY STARTUP METRICS VCS CARE ABOUT (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 VCs don't fund ideas, they fund metrics. While investors love
compelling stories, they rely on concrete numbers to gauge whether a
startup is scalable and worth funding. The most critical metrics vary
by stage—early investors focus on market potential and retention,
Series A demands sustainable growth with $3-5M ARR and 100%+ Net
Dollar Retention, while later rounds scrutinize efficiency indicators
like burn rate and gross margins. The metrics that matter most also
depend on your industry: SaaS investors prioritize ARR and NDR,
marketplace VCs watch GMV and take rates, consumer apps need strong
DAU/MAU ratios, and fintechs must show transaction volume with
regulatory compliance. 

 THE MOST COMMON MISTAKES WITH PRICING PAGES (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 B2B SaaS companies routinely sabotage their pricing pages through
avoidable mistakes. Hiding prices behind "Contact Sales" buttons turns
away 83% of procurement teams and excludes budget-conscious buyers who
could become advocates, while poorly designed freemium plans fail to
showcase core differentiators that enterprise evaluators need to see.
Feature comparison tables create additional problems when they're
optimized only for human eyes (making them invisible to AI procurement
tools) or use the confusing "everything from lower plan, plus..."
format that forces potential customers to read through multiple tiers
to understand what they're getting.

MISCELLANEOUS

 USE "BUT" STRATEGICALLY (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The word "but" negates whatever comes before it, which is why most
communication advice suggests avoiding it. Simply invert your sentence
structure—instead of "The positive thing, but the negative thing,"
try "The negative thing, but the positive thing." This subtle change
lets you speak directly about improvements while ending on a positive
note, making your feedback more motivating and allowing you to
disagree while still sounding collaborative, especially in situations
where you need to balance honesty with maintaining relationships. 

 THE MAGIC OF MARKETPLACES (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Marketplaces have been connecting buyers and sellers since ancient
Sumerian cities 5,000 years ago, evolving from physical spaces to
digital platforms that reshape industries by solving specific pain
points. Each successful marketplace begins with an unmet need and
builds trust through transparency, unique inventory, or superior
discovery. While some fear AI will replace marketplaces, it's more
likely to enhance them through better matching, simplified onboarding,
reduced service costs, and improved fraud detection. 

 NEW CEO MAY BLOCK INTEL SPLIT, TSMC'S PLAN FOR JV TO RUN FABS (8
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 TSMC has proposed a joint venture with Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to
operate Intel's chip foundries, following a request by former
President Trump. The proposal, which faces potential challenges, would
be contingent on approval from Intel's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who is
committed to keeping Intel's design and manufacturing integrated.
Tan's appointment has boosted investor confidence, although Intel's
turnaround remains a significant challenge.
