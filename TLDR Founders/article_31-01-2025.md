HEADLINES & TRENDS

 STATE OF PRIVATE MARKETS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SpaceX has overtaken ByteDance to become the world's most valuable
private company at $350 billion. This article tracks key trends across
private tech companies, including hiring patterns and sector updates
in AI, Fintech, and autonomous driving. Looking at specific companies,
it shows how Databricks is catching up to Snowflake's revenue but
burning more cash, while Anduril is growing at 100% yearly and
approaching $1 billion in revenue. 

 CUSTOMERS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR AI FEATURES (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 New research from 767 software users shows that labeling products as
"AI-powered" doesn't increase trust or willingness to pay. Companies
are better off showing specific benefits (like "save 30 minutes a
day") rather than using AI buzzwords. This post shows four practical
ways to market AI features without saying "AI" through examples from
companies like Canva and Notion. The research suggests that outside of
early tech adopters, customers care more about results than how the
technology works. 

 NO, AI IS NOT GOING TO KILL SEO (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SEO isn't dying with AI - it's evolving to focus more on user intent
and quality content. This article explains why AI will actually
encourage more specific, long-tail searches and create new
opportunities for websites. Drawing from past SEO changes, it shows
why optimizing for humans and machines remains important, even as
search behavior shifts toward AI-driven discovery.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO HIRE AN EARLY-STAGE SALES TEAM FROM $0 TO $1M ARR (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A founder shares insights from scaling their sales team from one
person to seven people and growing ARR 24x in 2024. This article
outlines specific traits to look for in early sales hires, like
thriving in ambiguity and being openly money-driven. It shows why
hiring sales reps in pairs and testing for deep product knowledge in
mock demos leads to better results through real examples from their
hiring process. 

 PRODUCTIVITY STACK (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article outlines ten practical productivity techniques that
helped one writer produce consistent, high-quality work. From setting
three daily goals to replacing calls with video messages, it focuses
on creating uninterrupted work time and eliminating distractions.
Instead of promising magical solutions, it shares specific tools and
habits that compound over time to improve output. 

 THE SKILL THAT WILL NEVER DIE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI makes information easier to access, but that doesn't mean thinking
is obsolete. Technology has always extended human abilities - cars
make us faster, phones make us louder, and AI makes us quicker at
processing data. However, raw information isn't the same as original
thought. The real value is in connecting ideas in ways that actually
matter to people. This post walks through how to recognize the
problems you naturally focus on, pull themes from them, and turn that
into something useful.

 PICKING YOUR BATTLES WHEN YOU ARE HYPER-RATIONAL (6 MINUTE READ) [14]


 Being technically right doesn't always move things forward. This
piece walks through real email exchanges where someone could have
corrected small misunderstandings, but instead just kept things simple
and direct. The point isn't to ignore details, but to recognize when
debating them won't change the outcome. Knowing when to skip the extra
explanation can make conversations (and decisions) move a lot faster. 

 CLIMATE TECH IN 2025: MORE BANKRUPTCIES AND LESS GREEN PREMIUM (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Europe's climate tech sector faces uncertainty following Northvolt's
bankruptcy, signaling potential challenges for other startups. Experts
predict increased focus on risk, resilience, and scaling NOAK
projects. There may also be a rebound in carbon markets, with 'carbon
neutral' labels gaining traction. 

 FRICTION THAT SELLS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Challenging conventional wisdom about frictionless experiences, some
startups find that strategic friction can boost both conversions and
retention. Companies like Duolingo and Headspace demonstrate how
thoughtfully designed extra steps - like goal-setting screens or
benefit previews - can increase user commitment and reinforce value.
