HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE PARALLEL ECONOMY AND THE NEW RULES OF AMERICAN POWER (10 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Economic realities are fracturing under disinformation, policy
swings, and AI-driven echo chambers. These parallel economies can
catch founders off guard, forcing them to adapt quickly or risk
obsolescence. Staying informed about geopolitical shifts and tech
manipulation is no longer optional—understanding how global upheaval
shapes markets will help you protect your venture and find strategic
openings. 

 EVOLUTIONIQ GOT ACQUIRED FOR $730M — HERE'S THEIR PLAYBOOK FOR
BUILDING AN ENDURING AI BUSINESS (53 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There is a paradox facing founders in 2025: easier product creation
due to AI, but tougher business longevity. EvolutionIQ's success in
bodily injury claims, marked by a $730M acquisition by CCC Intelligent
Solutions, came from a focused, relationship-driven approach combined
with deep industry expertise. By maintaining discipline in execution,
prioritizing top talent, and ensuring product-market fit through
focused expansion, EvolutionIQ built a durable business model in a
challenging market.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AN OPINIONATED GUIDE ON WHICH AI MODEL TO USE IN 2025 (10 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Picking the right AI for your startup requires self-awareness about
tasks and budget—whether it's ChatGPT for conversational support or
Gemini for advanced video. Each model has a unique sweet spot, so lean
into the one that complements your biggest daily challenges. When you
match the tool to your workflow rather than the hype, you amplify
productivity and preserve resources. 

 WHY YOU SHOULD NETWORK WITH INVESTORS BEFORE YOU RAISE (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Waiting until you're desperate for capital leads to rushed pitches
and shallow connections. Strong relationships built early let
investors see your consistent growth, making them more likely to
champion your cause. Think of networking as sowing seeds: nurturing
them over time ensures a more abundant harvest when you do decide to
fundraise. 

 THE DEFINITIVE FRAMEWORK TO FIND YOUR NEXT SCALABLE USER ACQUISITION
CHANNEL (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Smart user growth isn't about scattering resources but aligning them
with your product's natural advantages—maybe social sharing or high
search demand. Test small to confirm which channel works; when you see
traction, double down with confidence. Focusing on a channel that
resonates with your core offering often unlocks the fastest, most
sustainable growth.
