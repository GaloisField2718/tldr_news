CYBERATTACKS IN 2026? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Did you know that 82% of ransomware attacks target organizations with

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 A16Z RAISED $15B (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Andreessen Horowitz just raised $15B across six funds, capturing 18%
of all venture capital allocated in the US last year. The thesis
behind it is straightforward. It believes America's technological
leadership is existential, and that leadership depends on winning the
key architectures of the future, specifically AI and crypto. The funds
span American Dynamism, Apps, Bio + Health, Infrastructure, and
Growth. The bet is that applying these technologies to biology,
defense, education, and entertainment is what generates the next
century of human flourishing. 

 CLOUDED JUDGEMENT 1.9.26 - THE EDUCATION ADVANTAGE IN AI (11 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Real education happens through experience. The process is slow, but
unavoidable. The best AI companies design their products to accelerate
learning. The ones that will win will teach the market how to build
and then convince the market that their way is the right one.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW PERSONIO'S CRO BUILT AN AI-POWERED GO-TO-MARKET IN JUST 6 MONTHS
(12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Personio is a $3B+ HR platform with 400 salespeople. In May 2024, it
ran an "AI Surge Week" and felt good about adoption metrics. Then its
CRO noticed that high usage isn't transformation. Six months later, it
had 400+ AI assistants, cut SDR research time from 2 hours to 15
minutes, and booked 140 meetings in a week through an AI agent. 

 SALES PROBLEMS VS. PRODUCT-MARKET FIT PROBLEMS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 If you misdiagnose a product-market fit problem as a sales problem,
you'll hire a sales coach, and it won't help. The distinction comes
down to force and fit. Force is demand that exists independently of
your product. Is this customer actively trying to accomplish
something, and are their existing options not good enough? Fit only
matters after you've established force. The framework for diagnosing
which problem you actually have is surprisingly simple once you see
it.

 MASTERING WILLINGNESS TO PAY (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Almost 100% of founders undervalue themselves initially. You set your
first price from desperation and then never touch it again because
you're terrified everyone will leave. A lack of confidence is the
default state. 

 THE AI REVOLUTION IS HERE. WILL THE ECONOMY SURVIVE THE TRANSITION?
(20 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The man who predicted the 2008 crash, an Anthropic co-founder, and a
leading AI podcaster got in a Google Doc together to debate whether AI
is real or a historic misallocation of capital. The discussion covers
the infrastructure-to-application revenue gap, why enterprise AI
adoption is actually falling, where value accrues in the supply chain,
and what would change each of their minds.
