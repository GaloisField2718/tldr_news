completely.

busywork. It's the all-in-one platform [4] to hire, onboard, and pay

 In a dynamic reflection of evolving global trends, this latest "10
Charts" edition unveils significant shifts across diverse arenas, from
the rising use of ketamine in therapy to WhatsApp's breakthrough in
the US and the intriguing yet cautious embrace of AI in music

 UNCERTAINTY EVERYWHERE (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The current market is facing uncertainty as falling interest rates
are not boosting company valuations. There are concerns about business
fundamentals, growth, and the broader economy. Software companies are
experiencing a slowdown in growth, with many reporting
lower-than-expected guidance for the next quarter. Meanwhile, big
cloud companies like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud are heavily
investing in AI infrastructure. Despite the declining interest rates,
the median revenue multiple for software companies has remained
unchanged. The market is increasingly focused on the correlation
between growth, profitability, and valuation. 

 WORLD'S FIRST MAJOR AI LAW ENTERS INTO FORCE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The European Union's AI Act, the first comprehensive AI legislation
in the world, has come into effect, aiming to regulate the development
and use of artificial intelligence across the EU. The law adopts a
risk-based approach, imposing strict obligations on high-risk AI
applications and banning unacceptable-risk systems, which will
primarily impact large U.S. technology companies. While the AI Act has
implications beyond the EU, it also sets out some exceptions for
open-source generative AI models, provided they meet certain criteria
and do not pose systemic risks.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 4 STEPS TO SPEAK LIKE A CEO (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Effective communication is crucial for entrepreneurs and executives
to convey their vision and inspire others to support their endeavors.
However, many struggle to express themselves confidently and
authentically, often undermining their message with verbal tics, poor
body language, and unclear content. By setting clear goals,
cultivating the right qualities, and refining their delivery,
individuals can develop the executive presence needed to captivate
audiences and achieve their objectives. 

 GLOBAL SALES: START FROM DAY ONE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Startups aiming for global success should focus on developing
effective global sales strategies from day one. Successful founders
assess local vs global product-market fit, identify areas of greatest
traction, and leverage outbound sales, community building, and partner
networks. Founders should be cautious about common pitfalls such as
pulling out of founder-led sales too early, making misaligned sales
hires, inadequate onboarding, and overreliance on push sales tactics. 

 FILL THE BATHTUB (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In a world where truth seems increasingly elusive, people are
yearning for authenticity and honesty. Building trust is a gradual
process, much like filling a bathtub one drop at a time, but it can be
easily shattered by a single significant breach of trust. The key to
navigating this landscape lies in seeking out and aligning with
individuals and organizations committed to the long-term, patient
process of earning and maintaining trust through consistent,
principled actions.

 WHY YOUR STARTUP NEEDS A PATENT STRATEGY (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Even the busiest startups can't afford to ignore patent strategy.
It's not about hoarding patents, but understanding their value and
timing. With insights from seasoned experts in tech, law, and
marketing at Balderton, this piece navigates the why and how of
patenting for fledgling companies. It highlights the importance of
crucial timing, potential loss of rights without patent protection,
and strategic planning tips for startups. 

 LITTLE SISTER SYNDROME (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Humans tend to be poor at making accurate estimates due to flawed
mental shortcuts, such as the anchoring effect, where an initial piece
of information influences subsequent judgments. This phenomenon can
lead to underestimating or overestimating people's abilities, causing
missed opportunities and talent to go unrecognized. By recognizing and
adjusting for these biases, individuals and organizations can make
more informed decisions and foster growth and success. 

 STARTUP GROWTH TRAJECTORIES AND THE SAAS MENDOZA LINE (8 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 The SaaS Mendoza Line, inspired by baseball, benchmarks growth rates
to build a ‚Äúline‚Äù from the early stages to IPO. If your growth
rate stays above the line, you're deemed a high-growth startup and
VC-backable. The Mendoza Line was first introduced six years ago, and
since then, the standards for SaaS have increased significantly.
Updated in 2024 to reflect higher IPO criteria, it suggests SaaS
startups should aim for $250M ARR with 25% growth as a baseline
pre-IPO, up from $100m ARR six years ago.
