HEADLINES & TRENDS

 LESSONS ON BUILDING HARDWARE FROM EIGHT SLEEP (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Eight Sleep, a company from YC's Summer 2015 class, developed the
Pod, an intelligent mattress cover that adjusts temperature for
optimal sleep, which has become highly popular. In this article, the
founders share key insights for hardware startups, emphasizing the
importance of solving unit economics early, maintaining high
development velocity, creating a unique product feature that is hard
to replicate, aligning hardware and software teams, and integrating
robust customer support into the product experience. 

 SOFTWARE WEAKNESS ACROSS THE BOARD (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The recent Q1 earnings season for software companies has been
challenging, with many companies experiencing weaker demand, increased
scrutiny of budgets, and slower deal progression. Despite some mixed
signals from consumer spending, the overall outlook for the software
industry remains uncertain, with only a few companies tied to AI
tailwinds seeing positive growth. 

 APPLE X OPENAI (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple is close to reaching a deal with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT
technology into the upcoming iOS 18 operating system for iPhones. The
company is also in ongoing discussions with Google about potentially
licensing its Gemini chatbot as part of a broader effort to introduce
new AI features across Apple's products and services.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SAFE OR PRICED ROUND? THAT IS THE QUESTION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Convertible notes and SAFEs have become increasingly popular in
recent years due to their simplicity, speed, and lower transaction
costs. With a single document and standardized terms, these
instruments allow founders to raise money quickly without the need for
complex negotiations or extensive legal work. However, this simplicity
comes with some notable drawbacks, including uncertain dilution, lack
of price discovery, and the potential for misaligned incentives
between founders and investors. 

 A SIMPLE TOOL TO BEAT BURNOUT AND BOOST FULFILLMENT (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 This author shares a personal story of burnout and introduces the
"Energy Audit" tool, which involves categorizing daily activities as
energy-giving, energy-draining, or neutral. One can aim to end each
day with a positive energy balance and combat burnout by identifying
trends, reducing energy-draining activities, increasing energy-giving
ones, and strategically scheduling them. 

 GROWTH AT DROPBOX (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Growth team at Dropbox concentrates on four core metrics:
acquisition, activation, monetization, and engagement. The team is
divided into two functions - Growth Product Management and Data. The
former focuses exclusively on distribution, while the latter analyzes
data. Dropbox is highly deliberate in developing a growth culture and
hiring people to join the team. It encourages learning from mistakes
and prioritizes continuous innovation, with a particular emphasis on
improving product-led growth.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW BECOMING A PARENT HAS MADE ME A BETTER LEADER (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Having a life outside of work, such as being a parent, can actually
enhance one's leadership skills by fostering efficiency, risk-taking,
and emotional accessibility. This perspective challenges the common
narrative that having personal commitments outside of work leads to
failure, instead highlighting the benefits of balancing multiple
responsibilities. 

 THE STRUGGLE OF LATE CUSTOMER PAYMENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Late customer payments are causing significant cash flow issues for
businesses, prompting the need for a more efficient collections
process. Strategies such as running AR aging reports, documenting and
optimizing collections workflows, and incorporating payment terms into
sales compensation plans are recommended to improve the timeliness of
customer payments and overall financial health of the company. 

 SHOULD I MEET PROSPECTS AND CUSTOMERS FACE-TO-FACE? (2 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered the SaaS landscape,
with remote work and Zoom meetings becoming the norm for closing deals
and engaging with customers. However, in-person meetings with top
customers and prospects remain crucial for fostering stronger
relationships, increasing win rates, and driving customer success,
even if the timing of these face-to-face interactions has shifted to
later stages in the sales funnel.

QUICK LINKS

 WHAT SCALES, WHAT DOESN'T, AND WHY THIS KILLS YOU (2 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Focusing on creating products and experiences tailored to individual
customers, rather than abstract market segments, is crucial for
success. 

 THE DANGER OF "WHAT'S NEXT?‚Äù (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The relentless pursuit of more and better can lead to a never-ending
cycle of dissatisfaction, causing individuals to overlook and
underappreciate the present moment and the accomplishments they've
already achieved. 

 AMBITION VS. CONTENTMENT (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The story of Icarus also cautions against flying too low, emphasizing
the need for a balanced approach between ambition and contentment,
highlighting the dangers of both extremes.
