 BOT ATTACKS ARE EVOLVING. IS YOUR APP READY? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Modern bots behave like real users [5]. They execute JavaScript,
rotate IPs, and solve CAPTCHAs with AI. Traditional detection tools
can't keep up. 

WorkOS Radar [6] stops abuse at the source. Just one API call blocks
bots, brute force attacks, and free trial abuse without slowing down
real users.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THEMES FROM MY RECENT WEEK IN SILICON VALLEY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A wave of neo-labs focused on fine-tuning, tools, and enterprise
adoption has emerged around major frontier model providers, but many
of these will ultimately be tuck-in acquisitions rather than enduring
standalone platforms. Alphabet is actively pursuing partnerships to
expand TPU penetration beyond its own workloads. There is significant
early-stage founder activity in AI infrastructure under a broad theme
of US infrastructure onshoring and leadership. Robotics is now
extremely hot - many companies are raising at high valuations with
limited or no product. 

 MORE THAN THREE KINDS OF AI PRODUCTS WORK! (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI is not limited to just large language models. There are other
types of models, such as classification models, audio transcription
models, risk analysis models, and driving models. AI has the potential
to provide billions of dollars in value to the world. This article
provides an overview of the different types of AI out there.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BUILDING A 60% AI TEAM: EFFICIENT, PROFITABLE, AND SURPRISINGLY
LONELY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI may be a necessity in 2025 to be competitive. The unit economics
alone make it almost impossible to justify hiring humans for many
functions. Tutoring an AI is much easier in many cases. However, an AI
team is a quiet one - it can be lonely when group meetings are gone
and there's no one to grab after work drinks with. 

 I ANALYZED 1,000 FORWARD DEPLOYED ENGINEER JOBS: WHAT I LEARNED…
(18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) are software engineers who embed
directly with customers to build, deploy, and maintain complex
technical systems in production. They are like a hybrid of a senior
software engineer and a technical consultant. The role is exploding in
growth because AI deployment is hard - companies need engineers who
can ensure complex AI systems actually work in the real world. If you
want to become an FDE, learn Python, get comfortable with AI/ML, build
customer skills, be ready to travel, and target growth-stage startups.


 PLATFORM PRODUCTS & METRICS MYTHS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Platform PM myths include believing all investments must have
immediate ROI and that metrics must be instantly measurable. Metrics
often need time to show value, and sharing ownership across teams can
drive better outcomes. Platform innovations, though less visible, play
crucial roles in long-term success by enhancing scalability,
efficiency, and competitive differentiation.

the thread.

 WHY THE HELL IS IT SO HARD TO PRICE AN IPO? (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 IPO pricing looks random right now. Years without many listings
created so much pent-up demand that almost anything gets swarmed,
making it hard to read real investor interest. Layer on a bull market,
where even shaky companies feel “safe enough,” and the signals get
even messier. Banks still have to anchor pricing to peer multiples,
not hype. Then algorithms jump on every small move and amplify it,
which is why day one keeps catching people off guard. 

 APPLICATION SOFTWARE IS DEAD, AGAIN (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 If models keep getting better every nine to twelve months, what does
that mean for software companies trying to stay relevant? Value is
drifting toward the data layer, where Snowflake and Databricks already
sit, while “application” companies increasingly blur into agent
labs that train their own models and move down-stack.

QUICK LINKS

 MARKETPLACES IN THE AGE OF AI (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI can make unattractive unit economics 'work' and remove bottlenecks
that would previously be inhibitors to scale. 

 AI IN PRACTICE SURVEY (2 MINUTE READ) [18]

gaps are, and how teams are hardening and scaling AI in practice. 

 AI IS THE MARKET, AND THE MARKET IS THE GOVERNMENT (12 MINUTE READ)
[19]

 STILLNESS & SCALE: BUILDING A STARTUP FROM A PLACE OF PEACE (4 MINUTE
READ) [20]

wanting an inner life that isn't ruled by striving. 

 BUILDING THE TALENT ENGINE: HIRING YOUR FIRST RECRUITER (7 MINUTE
READ) [21]
