HEADLINES & TRENDS

 PREDICTING STARTUP SUCCESS WITH DATA (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 If you want to spot the next big startup, it's not just about the
data. It's about knowing what data matters. You have to look for
subtle clues others miss. Things like what makes the founders tick.
The little details that set the product apart. But you also have to be
careful. A lot of startup data comes from companies that already got
money from VCs. It's biased. To really see the future, you need a keen
eye and a questioning mind. 

 WHAT JUST HAPPENED (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The last month saw AI breakthroughs come fast. Homemade versions of
GPT-4 appeared. New AIs can think, catch mistakes in papers, and work
with live video. The technology is moving at breakneck speed. The
potential seems limitless. If you want a say in where it goes, now's
the time. The window is closing. 

 HERSHEY DOESN'T JUST SELL CHOCOLATE, THEY SELL HAPPINESS (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Hershey has mastered the art of selling more than just chocolate -
they sell happiness in every bite. By leveraging buyer psychology
principles like the affect heuristic, linking their products with
positive emotions, they've built a beloved brand. Seasonal scarcity
and nostalgia-inducing storytelling further drive consumer desire.
Hershey proves that offering discounts isn't the only way to generate
demand; focusing on the intangible benefits and emotional connections
can be even more powerful.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DON'T HAVE A BIGGEST CUSTOMER (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 When a large customer outgrows your SaaS product, wish them well or
accommodate them if it benefits your entire customer base. However,
having a "largest customer" is actually a company's biggest weakness.
If losing a single customer is detrimental, you're no longer making
your own product but rather custom software for big clients. The
solution is to cap prices so no one pays significantly more than
others. Aim for a customer base that looks like "even static," where
each one's financial impact is indistinguishable. That way, if any
random customer leaves, you won't feel it or fear it. 

 BUILDING YOUR SALES PROCESS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sales is a grind. Prospects ghost you, meetings go sideways, and
deals fall apart. However, the pattern is clear: listen for the 1-3
burning problems, show exactly how your product solves them, and close
with momentum. This post breaks it down: keep demos tight, lean on
case studies, and always book next steps on the call. A focused
45-minute process is all you need - build trust, solve the pain, and
lock the deal. For every ten no's, one yes changes everything. 

 HOW TO EXIT (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Investors must navigate secondary transactions to achieve liquidity
as startups remain private longer. The secondary market, fueled by
market, regulatory, and competitive shifts, is growing rapidly,
creating opportunities for early exits. Understanding and planning for
these transactions is now a critical venture capital skill.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE OFF-PRICE EDGE (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Fancy discount stores like TJ Maxx are having a moment. They've got a
winning formula. First, they buy nice items for cheap. Then they keep
costs down with no-frills stores. It's a double whammy that keeps
profits up and customers hooked. Now the big retailers are racing to
copy them. In the future of retail, the smart money is on the treasure
hunt. 

 HOW TO MAKE LLMS SHUT UP (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Greptile's AI code review bot initially generated too many
low-quality comments, frustrating users. Prompting tricks and using
the LLM to judge comment severity didn't solve the problem. The key
insight was that comment quality standards vary by team. By clustering
past comments into "good" and "bad" based on user feedback, then
blocking new comments too similar to "bad" clusters, Greptile reduced
noise and boosted the percentage of comments addressed by developers
from 19% to 55%+. 

 CONTENT IS KING, BUT DISTRIBUTION IS THE KINGDOM (5 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Brands invest heavily in content to connect with customers, but they
outsource nearly half of it. In a world where people crave a personal
touch, that approach falls flat. Savvy brands are taking a page from
media companies' playbooks. They're building in-house content teams to
craft and share their unique story. It's a challenging shift, but it's
the only way to maintain relevance.
