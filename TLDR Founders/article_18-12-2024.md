HEADLINES & TRENDS

 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND AI AGENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Most people focus too much on the technology behind AI agents, but
the key to success is deeply understanding the end user. Developers
should prioritize defining clear metrics that capture what matters
most to the user and their organization. The most impactful agents
will be the ones that align their reward systems with the humans
they're assisting 

 AS VMS HYPE CONTINUES, WHAT WILL BE IN VOGUE IN 2025? (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Despite the AI threat, the boom in Vertical Market Software rollups
persists into its 5th year. Success requires a clear strategy: tightly
integrated thematic acquisitions or decentralized capital allocation.
Hot niches include vendor app marketplaces and cloud "hyperscaler"
plugins, while horizontal SMB software faces disruption risks. The
marginal VMS aggregator is often founded by ex-investors lacking
operating experience, a risky approach. 

 AI + STABLECOINS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The combination of stablecoins and AI agents is transforming finance,
enabling autonomous economic systems that are smarter and more
efficient. Stablecoins provide the stable, programmable liquidity AI
needs to optimize complex processes like DeFi and cross-border
payments. This synergy is making transactions faster, cheaper, and
more accessible, paving the way for entirely new machine-to-machine
economies.

 ENTERPRISE SALES IN HIGH GEAR (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI is fueling unprecedented early revenue growth for enterprise
startups, with some achieving "quintuple-quadruple-triple-double"
trajectories. Factors include AI excitement driving adoption, employee
replacement expanding sales surface area, and LLMs enabling
plug-and-play integrations. While durability remains uncertain, the
landscape favors top Series A firms that can reliably access the
fastest-growing companies.

 THE RISE OF MINI TOOLS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI advancements have made it faster and cheaper for startups to
create mini tools as a growth strategy. These free, helpful tools
attract users, generate traffic, and allow even non-developers to
build AI-powered solutions in minutes. The approach enables startups
to reach niche audiences, though low-quality or niche tools risk
hurting the brand. 

 DEBANKING (AND DEBUNKING?) (2 HOUR READ) [16] 

 Marc Andreessen discussed "debanking" as a political tool used
without due process in a podcast with Ben Horowitz and on Joe Rogan's
show supported by a16z's publication. The discussion centered around
the closure of bank accounts without reason, highlighting its impacts,
particularly on certain industries like crypto, where operations can
become nearly unbankable due to perceived risks.
