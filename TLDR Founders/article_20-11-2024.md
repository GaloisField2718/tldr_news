HEADLINES & TRENDS

 SERVICETITAN: BENCHMARKING THE S1 DATA (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 ServiceTitan has filed an initial S-1 statement in preparation for
going public. The company provides a comprehensive operating system
for "trades" businesses (such as plumbing, HVAC, and landscaping) that
addresses key workflows like CRM, FSM, ERP, HCM, and FinTech. With a
serviceable market opportunity of $13 billion, ServiceTitan's recent
financial performance includes $685 million in revenue over the last
12 months, a 26% growth rate, and a gross margin of 64%, though the
company posted negative operating and free cash flow margins. 

 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WANTS GOOGLE TO SELL CHROME (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly considering asking a
court to force Google to sell its Chrome browser to curb the tech
giant's search monopoly as Chrome's dominance disproportionately
supports Google's broader market control. In addition to banning
exclusive deals, the DOJ may push for greater data transparency,
AI-related measures, and the separation of Android from Google's other
products, though it will stop short of demanding an Android
divestiture. Google plans to appeal the ruling. Experts warn that the
proposed remedies could face legal challenges or potential
interference from the incoming Trump administration.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY 90% OF STARTUPS FAIL AND HOW TO BEAT THE ODDS EARLY (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Startups often fail due to team dynamics, with misalignments in
vision, role ambiguity, and interpersonal conflicts being common
causes for failure. Effective communication, conflict resolution, and
clear role definitions are crucial for sustaining cohesion and
navigating the pressures of entrepreneurship, especially as founding
teams evolve. Proactive strategies such as succession planning and
maintaining alignment can help startups weather these challenges and
improve their chances of long-term success. 

 STOP OVERTHINKING YOUR STRATEGY (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Small companies often overthink strategy by trying to emulate big
firms. This can lead to rigid, long-term plans that aren't suited to
their fast-paced, uncertain environments. They should instead quickly
test ideas, learn from feedback, and adapt in real time. This approach
not only leads to quicker results but also builds momentum and allows
smaller companies to stay agile and competitive. 

 OPINIONATED AI PRODUCTS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 As the barriers to creating software continue to erode, the concept
of "artisanal SaaS" gains more relevance. Taste, design, and emotional
resonance are important in software products. Belief systems, like
those that once favored IBM or now sustain companies like Salesforce,
play a critical role in shaping market leaders. Generative AI, still
in its infancy, presents a similar opportunity for founders to align
their products with new beliefs and deliver strong forms of AI that
can redefine markets and user experiences.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CAMERAS, CODE, AND CREATION (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 While AI may drastically reduce technical barriers in software
development and education, the fundamental challenge of human
motivation remains largely unchanged. However, just like how
smartphone cameras transformed visual creativity through platforms
like Instagram, AI's true potential may lie not in creating more
traditional developers or students, but in enabling entirely new forms
of creative expression and problem-solving that we haven't yet
imagined. 

 THE WORLD NEEDS ANOTHER BEN FRANKLIN (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Diverse interests and experiences are increasingly important in a
world where knowledge is easily accessible. Innovation and wisdom come
from a broad range of activities. Polymaths like Benjamin Franklin,
who excelled in multiple fields, show how varied pursuits can lead to
greater creativity, problem-solving abilities, and a more fulfilling
life. 

 BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF HARDWARE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI-driven engineering tools are revolutionizing hardware development
by addressing inefficiencies in design, collaboration, simulation, and
manufacturing processes. Emerging platforms are leveraging AI to
automate tasks, enhance collaboration through data integration, and
accelerate simulations, enabling faster, more innovative product
development. These advancements offer significant potential to reshape
the hardware engineering landscape and provide an opportunity for new
players to challenge established incumbents.

QUICK LINKS

 WHEN WE BECOME COGS (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI greatly improves productivity by automating tasks like idea
generation, which could lead to more discoveries and innovations, but
it also reduces job satisfaction by removing the creative aspects that
many find fulfilling. 

 THE ARGUMENTS FOR NOT RAISING AT A UNICORN VALUATION (2 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Unicorn production slowed during the tech stock decline in 2022, but
AI's resurgence has reignited interest in high-valuation startups,
particularly in AI B2B companies. 

 MAKING IT HAPPEN VS. LETTING IT HAPPEN (2 MINUTE READ) [19]

more effortless progress.
