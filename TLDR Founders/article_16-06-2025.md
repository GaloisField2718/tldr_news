HEADLINES & TRENDS

 GOOGLE SHUT THE DOOR ON COMPETITION, AI SWUNG IT BACK OPEN (6 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google killed the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button because it cost the
company $100M/year in lost ads. The company's entire model depends on
showing links so it can show ads above them. Now AI threatens to give
direct answers instead of links. 

 AI-POWERED WORK ASSISTANT GLEAN LANDS $150M AT $7.2B VALUATION (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Glean, an enterprise AI startup, raised $150 million in Series F
funding, boosting its valuation to $7.2 billion. The capital will
accelerate product innovation, partner ecosystem expansion, and
international growth. 

 LINEAR'S $82M SERIES C AND AI VISION (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Linear raised $82M in a Series C round, valuing the company at
$1.25B. The company will enhance its product while resisting
traditional "best practices" and focusing on delivering quality
experiences. The funds will further integrate AI into Linear's tools,
making workflows more efficient by accommodating AI agents. Linear is
committed to maintaining profitability and innovation for its 15,000+
clients, including major names like OpenAI and CashApp.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FROM CHURN TO GROWTH: MAPPING YOUR EXPANSION PLAYBOOK (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 SMB churn is killing your NRR. The difference between 99% and 105%
retention can make or break your next fundraise. Before throwing
bodies at the problem, figure out if your expansions come from inbound
requests or require outbound hunting - this determines whether you
need better self-serve paths or actual sales plays. 

 THE BATTLE FOR DATA OWNERSHIP (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Slack just made it nearly impossible to export your own data with new
API limits of one request per minute and by blocking third-party tools
from indexing conversations. This matters because incumbents like
Slack and Salesforce are terrified that AI agents will handle all the
actual work while they're reduced to storage systems, so they're
locking down access and forcing users to use their agents instead. 

 HOW TO SUPERCHARGE YOUR STARTUP WITH YOUR FIRST SENIOR HIRE (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Hiring a senior leader can transform a startup by offloading
responsibilities and providing strategic partnership. Founders should
prioritize candidates who offer relevant domain expertise and a
collaborative mindset, ensuring they complement rather than overshadow
the existing team. Clear expectations and thoughtful integration boost
the chances of success with senior hires.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ELAD GIL'S FRAMEWORK FOR SPOTTING BILLION-DOLLAR MARKETS (5 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Minted looked like a wedding invitation site. Gusto was boring
payroll software. Both became billion-dollar companies. Elad Gil's
playbook: find markets everyone avoids for dumb reasons. Payments were
"too risky" until Stripe built better fraud tools. Gusto's founders
watched their parents struggle with ADP monthly and fixed it. 

 A NEW MVC IS EMERGING (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The classic Model/View/Controller pattern that has guided software
for decades is being flipped by AI. Instead of rigid relationships
between data, interface, and logic, we're moving to intelligent agents
that dynamically orchestrate distributed systems. LLMs become Models
(grown not built), Apps become Views (just interfaces, not data
stores), and Agents become Controllers (making real-time decisions
across systems). 

 ASANA VS MONDAY.COM (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Asana traded higher than Monday.com in 2021 despite worse metrics
because Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz owns 56% and pumped $1B
into the stock. The market bought his "future of work" narrative over
Monday's actual numbers. Today, the truth is brutal: Monday trades at
3x Asana's multiple with 30% margins vs 1%, grows 3x faster, and has
112% NRR, while Asana's collapsed to 95%. Build a business that wins
on fundamentals, not founder mystique.
