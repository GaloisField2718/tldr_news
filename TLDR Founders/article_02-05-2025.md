HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE UNITED STATES OF AMAZON (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 When Amazon briefly considered showing tariff costs on product pages
then quickly reversed course after a presidential phone call, it
revealed our new economic reality: a stage where perception trumps
market principles. This post unpacks this "economic surrealism," where
corporate power bows to government intervention, AI flatters rather
than informs us, and traditional economic relationships break down.
For founders, this means preparing for inflation over recession,
investing in companies tied to physical assets, and watching
narratives closely—because in this environment, the story often
matters more than the fundamentals. 

 THE EVOLUTION OF STARTUP COMPETITION (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The protective moats that once shielded startups have vanished. Cloud
infrastructure costs pennies, no-code tools eliminate technical
barriers, and global talent pools make team-building accessible to
anyone. Today we face instant competition the moment we show traction.
Remember, difficult is defensible. Try your best to invest in building
proprietary technology, creating unique distribution channels, or
serving overlooked markets. 

 AN INTERVIEW WITH META CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG ABOUT AI AND THE EVOLUTION
OF SOCIAL MEDIA (57 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mark Zuckerberg discussed Meta's ongoing evolution, highlighting how
AI and open-source models like Llama fit into Meta's broader business
strategy. He emphasized Meta's focus on integrating AI to enhance
advertising, grow consumer engagement, and support business messaging,
asserting the long-term value it brings in spite of substantial
training costs. Zuckerberg also touched on the future potential of AR
glasses and the vision of combining digital and physical realms under
the Meta brand.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LAND YOUR FIRST CUSTOMERS 3X FASTER (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 We all fall prey to building elaborate product roadmaps, only to
watch reality tear them apart. Stop assuming you know exactly what to
build and adopt traction roadmaps instead. The GO-LEAN framework
creates immediate focus: identify your funnel's biggest bottleneck,
direct 80% of your effort there, run experiments, analyze what worked,
and then move to the next constraint. 

 AT THE EDGE OF WHAT'S NEXT: NAVIGATING LIFE'S BIG TRANSITIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The void between your past and future holds power, whether you chose
this transition or it crashed into you uninvited. Most founders rush
to fill this space, but intentional reflection during transitions
helps you reconsider identity and reimagine possibilities. The Revolve
framework (Reset + Evolve) turns these moments from crises into
opportunities. 

 STRIPE ENABLES IOS APPS TO SELL IN-APP DIGITAL GOODS VIA EXTERNAL
STRIPE CHECKOUT LINKS, AVOIDING APP STORE COMMISSIONS (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Stripe now lets iOS developers redirect users to a secure
Stripe-hosted payment page outside the app for purchasing digital
goods. The integration supports creating products, managing customers,
and using universal links to return users to the app after payment.
Developers handle order fulfillment via Stripe webhooks, enabling a
seamless payment experience without native in-app purchases.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GTM MATH SIMPLIFIED (SORT OF) (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 B2B marketing doesn't have to be complicated. Start with the basics:
define your market, craft a unique message, create content mechanisms
that drive demand, and develop processes to nurture leads before
passing them to sales. However, beware of the ABM trap—targeting
specific accounts doesn't mean abandoning broader marketing efforts.
The buying journey inevitably includes research and peer
recommendations, so you still need people "bumping into you all over
the place." Success requires balancing account-targeted activities
with building a broader presence that establishes credibility across
your entire market. 

 WHO SHOULD CARE? (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Product leaders often split into two camps—pragmatic pirates who
focus on delivering customer value versus those who invest in broader
organizational health. Pirates drive innovation with customer focus,
but someone must eventually treat the company itself as a product
worth improving. Your startup needs both energies: the push to build
great products and the systems where multiple teams can thrive.

 South Park Commons has announced its $275M third fund. It previously
