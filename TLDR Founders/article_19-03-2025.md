HEADLINES & TRENDS

 LAWSUIT ALLEGES $12 BILLION "UNICORN" DEEL CULTIVATED SPY,
ORCHESTRATED LONG-RUNNING TRADE-SECRET THEFT & CORPORATE ESPIONAGE
AGAINST COMPETITOR (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A lawsuit filed against $12 billion HR unicorn Deel claims the
company ran an espionage operation by planting a spy inside competitor
Rippling who conducted over 6,000 searches to steal sales data.
Rippling caught the scheme by setting a trap—creating a fake Slack
channel mentioned only in a letter to Deel executives, which the spy
immediately searched for. The litigation threatens to expose illegal
competitive practices in the high-stakes HR tech industry. 

 GOOGLE ACQUIRING CLOUD SECURITY COMPANY WIZ FOR $32B (1 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Google's $32 billion all-cash acquisition of cloud security startup
Wiz, aimed at strengthening Google Cloud's defenses against emerging
threats, marks one of tech's largest security deals. Wiz's platform
builds comprehensive security graphs across cloud environments to
identify potential attack paths before incidents occur. Despite
Google's ownership, Wiz will continue to operate independently and
support multiple cloud providers, including AWS and Azure, maintaining
its multi cloud approach while gaining access to Google's resources in
the increasingly competitive cloud security market. 

 MISTRAL SMALL 3.1 (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The newly released Mistral Small 3.1 model surpasses competitors like
Gemma 3 and GPT-4o Mini with enhanced text performance, multimodal
understanding, and a 128k token context window. It's designed for
various AI applications, including instruction following,
conversational assistance, and image processing, offering fast
inference speeds and running efficiently on hardware like an RTX 4090.
Available under Apache 2.0, Mistral Small 3.1 can be accessed through
Hugging Face, used via API on Mistral AI's developer playground, and
will soon be available on NVIDIA NIM and Microsoft Azure AI Foundry.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 IMAGINE SPENDING $1 AND MAKING $68 ON AVERAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 EasyPlant turned the frustration of killing houseplants into a
thriving business with one brilliant solution: self-watering plants
you only need to water once a month. Its four-word promise—"Our
Plants Water Themselves"—directly addresses the biggest pain point
plant lovers face. EasyPlant's marketing works because it eliminates
buyers' fear of failure, targets people at key moments (like when
redecorating), and helps customers feel like successful plant parents
without the stress. By flipping a common problem into a simple
solution, it has made itself the obvious choice for anyone who's ever
watched a plant die and felt like a failure. 

 WHAT CONTENT WORKS WELL IN LLMS? (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI chatbots ignore traditional SEO factors and instead prefer
comprehensive content with high word counts, with brand popularity
strongly determining whether companies get mentioned. To improve AI
visibility, create in-depth content answering specific questions,
ensure your site isn't blocking AI crawlers, and build overall brand
awareness since popular brands receive significantly more mentions
across all AI systems. 

 WHEN SHOULD STARTUPS PRIORITIZE PMF SCORE OVER NPS? (3 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Smart startups measure success differently at each stage of growth.
Early on, use the Product Market Fit Score to ask "How disappointed
would you be if our product disappeared?" This reveals if you've built
something truly essential. Only after 40% of users would be "very
disappointed" without you should you start tracking Net Promoter
Score, which measures referrals. Following this sequence prevents the
common trap of having customers who casually recommend your product
but wouldn't actually miss it if it vanished.

 THE TENSION OF EARLY PRODUCT COMMUNICATION (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 When making new products in your company, be careful about who you
tell and when. Start by only telling your direct boss during the early
idea stage. Once you have something to test, let some coworkers try it
but meet with important team leaders before making big announcements.
Only after your product is working well and customers like it should
you share regular updates with everyone. Don't worry if some people
wish they knew sooner - that always happens no matter what you do. 

 THE MARKETING EFFICIENCY & ATTRIBUTION PLAYBOOK: WHAT TODAY'S CMOS
ARE TRACKING (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A major new benchmarking study reveals how successful B2B marketers
track their impact. Smart founders should focus on cost-per-revenue
instead of just pipeline numbers to see which marketing actually
creates customers, not just leads. Your tracking should grow with your
company—count deals by hand when small, watch where leads come from
as you grow, then use systems that show the full customer journey once
you're bigger. 

 HOW TO BE A TOP 1% ANGEL (9 MINUTE READ) [17]

intentions and a structured strategy to mitigate the inherent risks.
This comprehensive guide, based on insights from experienced
investors, outlines steps for effective angel investing, including
establishing motivations, structuring investments, sourcing deals, and
building a network.
