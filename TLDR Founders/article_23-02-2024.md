HEADLINES & TRENDS

 REDDIT FILES FOR IPO AND INVITES POWER USERS TO INVEST (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Reddit has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the SEC.
The filing revealed that it made $804 million in revenue last year,
mostly from advertising, while incurring a net loss of $90.8 million.
In an unconventional move, Reddit is offering a portion of its shares
to some of its most dedicated users, including moderators and those
with high karma scores. 

 BENCHMARKS FOR FOUNDER SALARY AND BURN RATE BY STAGE (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Comprehensive insights into founder compensation, employee stock
option pools (ESOP), burn rates, and team size by stage. Recent data
shows early-stage companies are burning way less cash monthly than
during 2021's ZIRP era. While $20M+ high-growth ventures might be
burning $1M+ per month, more modest sub-$5M startups now operate on
$50K or less. 

 THE STATE OF SAAS PRICING (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Is usage-based pricing still the future of SaaS pricing or does it
make companies too susceptible to market uncertainties and changes in
customer behavior? This article aims to examine the various pricing
models adopted by startups and evaluates their effectiveness.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BE MORE ASSERTIVE WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It‚Äôs easy to feel you're pestering customers, but being afraid to
speak up can lead to lost opportunities and revenue. As founders,
we‚Äôre serving customers with broader industry insights that they
lack. It‚Äôs okay to be assertive, push back, and say no to certain
requests, as long as you‚Äôre not aggressive. 

 WINNING STRATEGIES FOR APPLIED AI COMPANIES (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 We are currently experiencing the third wave of AI. The first wave
was research-driven AI. This was followed by the development of ML
infrastructure, and now we are in the era of applied AI. Applied AI
refers to SaaS companies that are utilizing AI to significantly
enhance their products. This article delves into more than 70 applied
AI companies that have raised over $7 million in VC funding,
highlighting how they are growing and why. 

 THE BEST WAY TO DRIVE DEMAND IN MARKETPLACES (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In marketplace businesses, the network is the product, and growing
both supply and demand is essential for the product to improve over
time. Driving between 10% and 40% of demand from supply is the
"Goldilocks zone" for maximizing the value of a marketplace's supply
to grow demand.

 PERFECTING THE PITCH (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article provides a pitch framework composed of five elements:
Timing, Pitch, Emotion, Signals, and Assessment. The framework
emphasizes the importance of timing in making a good first impression
and building credibility. It highlights the need for a concise and
engaging pitch that effectively communicates the market, opportunity,
product, team, and milestones. 

 TURNS OUT, GOOGLE IS ALL ABOUT LINKS AND CLICKS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google is showing more and more bad pages in its search results. Its
search engine is not able to easily see this content as spam like a
human - it still struggles to evaluate quality content. Google
continues to rely on clicks and links to tune rankings, possibly now
more than ever. 

 HOW NETFLIX BUILDS A CULTURE OF EXCELLENCE (73 MINUTE AUDIO) [17] 

 Elizabeth Stone, the CTO of Netflix, talks through how and why

communication.

 HOW DO INVESTORS FEEL ABOUT ACQUIHIRES? (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Investors' sentiment about "acquihires" has evolved over the years.
VCs initially worked with acquihires to provide a "soft landing" for
struggling startups, even if the returns were minimal. However, VCs
today generally don't prioritize acquihires as they don't want to
invest energy in getting minimal returns. 

 BREAKING THE J-CURVE (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Venture capital math is smart in theory, but stupid in practice.
It‚Äôs easy to get caught in metrics like the ideal LTV/CAC ratio.
However, be skeptical of rigid J-curve formulas when trying to build a
sustainable, growing business long-term. Find an unfair, low-cost
source of pipeline that gets you out of the J-curve game. 

 YOU WANT TO HEAR ADVICE THAT STINGS (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Startups can be very kumbaya at times - people don‚Äôt want to speak
hard truths. However, the truth is exactly what you need to hear. Find
people who give it to you straight and cherish them.
