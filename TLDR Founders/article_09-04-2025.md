HEADLINES & TRENDS

 YES, ARR IS DEAD (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 ARR is dying - not because subscription software is over, but because
what counts as "ARR" has become a joke. Companies are shoving
usage-based pricing, experimental AI spending with terrible retention,
and traditional contracts all into one metric, then making critical
decisions based on numbers that no longer mean what they used to. If
you're blending revenue with 85% margins and 5% churn alongside stuff
with 50% margins and 40% churn, you're fooling yourself. Break apart
your revenue streams, measure each one properly, and in this uncertain
landscape, focus on CAC payback - how quickly you get your money back
matters more than ever when you can't predict how long customers will
stick around. 

 DEAD CAT BOUNCE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Despite escalating trade tensions with China threatening "to fight to
the end" over new tariffs, markets rebounded strongly today - but is
this genuine recovery or just a dead cat bounce? The tariff impacts
are playing out in stark contrast across sectors: hardware companies
like Framework are pausing US sales after being forced to sell laptops
at a loss, while software firms face more indirect challenges through
rising data center costs and customers becoming more hesitant with
their budgets. 

 BROWSERBASE, CLAY, CURSOR, AND DATABRICKS TOP ENTERPRISE TECH 30 VC
SURVEY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Wing's Enterprise Tech 30 survey reveals VCs are highly interested in
AI startups, with Browserbase leading the early stage list. The list
highlights promising startups across stages, emphasizing AI
infrastructure, coding tools, and generative AI applications. Notable
mid-stage companies include Clay, Decagon, and Granola, while Cursor
tops the late stage list.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A GUIDE TO DISRUPTING INCUMBENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Smart startups don't attack incumbents head-on - they commoditize
their complements through three powerful strategies: nuking pricing
power, reducing switching costs, or eating the complement entirely.
The approach works especially well in today's Vertical AI landscape,
where startups can use LLMs to weaken incumbent lock-in - but beware
the pitfalls: don't commoditize complements critical to your own
product's stickiness, and ensure your product is positioned to capture
the value flow once complements become commodities. 

 MOST FOUNDERS ASK THE WRONG QUESTIONS IN VC FUNDRAISING MEETINGS (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Here's the thing most founders miss - those VC meetings aren't just
about getting a check. Every investor you pitch has seen hundreds of
startups, and that experience is yours to tap if you ask the right
questions. Don't waste your entire slot running through slides. In a
30-minute meeting, talk for 8 minutes and listen for 22. Ask things
like "How would you describe this to your partners?" or "What risks am
I not seeing?" or "Have you seen companies like mine crash and burn?"
These questions turn investors into free consultants and show you're
confident enough to handle tough feedback.

 Figma Slides' success was driven by prototyping, open collaboration,
and a strong team culture. Encouraging direct user engagement and
fostering a startup mindset helped maintain agility and innovation.
