 MOST ENTERPRISE AI APPS FAIL. HERE'S WHAT WORKS. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most AI apps never make it past the prototype phase because of
compliance gaps, security issues, and weak infrastructure. This guide
outlines how successful teams move quickly from idea to launch.

WorkOS [5] gives you the APIs and enterprise features—SSO, SCIM,
RBAC, and Audit Logs—so your team can go from prototype to
production, and fast.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 CLAY CONFIRMS IT CLOSED $100M ROUND AT $3.1B VALUATION (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Clay secured a $100 million Series C at a $3.1 billion valuation, led
by CapitalG, confirming earlier reports. This funding follows
significant rounds, including a $1.25 billion Series B six months ago.
With prominent clients like OpenAI and Canva, Clay expects to triple
last year's revenue to $100 million by year-end. 

 SMALL ACTION MODELS ARE THE FUTURE OF AI AGENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Using large foundation models for agent tool-calling is like using a
Ferrari to deliver pizza - expensive, rate-limited, and overpowered
for what's essentially a selection task. NVIDIA's research shows small
language models are actually better suited for tool orchestration, and
testing confirms this - a Salesforce xLAM model runs fast on a Mac M2
Pro with excellent accuracy while forcing better system design through
deterministic interfaces and robust error handling. 

 PALANTIR TOPS $1 BILLION IN REVENUE FOR THE FIRST TIME (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Palantir exceeded Wall Street estimates, achieving over $1 billion in
quarterly revenue for the first time and raising its full-year revenue
guidance. The company forecasts Q3 revenue between $1.083 billion and
$1.087 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. Significant growth
was seen in U.S. revenues, with government contracts and commercial
segments contributing to a 140% increase in total contract value to
$2.27 billion.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 25 PROVEN TACTICS TO ACCELERATE AI ADOPTION AT YOUR COMPANY (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Companies like Shopify, Zapier, and Duolingo are using specific
strategies to enhance AI adoption, focusing on organizational change
rather than just technology. These strategies include explaining
actionable AI tactics, tracking and rewarding AI usage, reducing
approval bottlenecks for AI tools, and transforming AI enthusiasts
into educators. Successful AI adoption also hinges on prioritizing
high-impact tasks and integrating AI into daily workflows to drive
productivity and innovation. 

 THE EFFICIENCY PARADOX: WHY OVER-OPTIMIZING COULD KILL YOUR STARTUP
(4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Frederick Taylor, the godfather of efficiency, failed spectacularly
when he first optimized a machine shop - production dropped 30%
because he perfected a system for yesterday's problems while the
company was still figuring out what to build. Modern founders fall
into the same trap, spending weeks implementing Google-style OKRs with
ten customers, or A/B testing headlines while their business model is
broken. 

 HOW TO WIN WITH AI VIDEO ADS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ad expert Dan Birdwhistell (who's managed $800M for Shopify and
Coinbase) found AI video ads beat human ads by 2x on conversion -
here's his playbook after 50+ hours with Google's Veo3.

MISCELLANEOUS

 YOU COULD JUST CHOOSE OPTIMISM (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Two old men on separate flights both ordered champagne - one
complained it wasn't good enough and spent the flight grouchy, the
other was genuinely happy to be drinking free alcohol while flying
over the Alps. As a founder, you face this choice daily: complain
about investor rejections, bugs, and competition, or stay genuinely
excited about building something new. Complainers hide behind "high
standards", but choosing optimism doesn't mean accepting mediocrity -
it means not letting every setback poison your energy, because in
startups, your mood becomes your team's mood and eventually your
company's culture. 

 AI'S "JUST SHIP IT." PROBLEM (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Stanford studied 100,000 developers and found AI boosts simple tasks
by 60% but complex work by only 5%, with most gains around 20% - plus
AI-generated code increases rework. The punchline is that AI makes you
throw spaghetti at the wall faster, but it doesn't make your wall
bigger or help you validate whether the spaghetti stuck - and when 75%
of product ideas fail anyway, shipping yourself out of business just
got easier. 

 SHOULD YOU TAKE MONEY FROM CORPORATE INVESTMENT ARMS? (4 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Stanford data shows corporate VCs now participate in over 20% of
startup deals, offering patient capital, distribution channels, and
even built-in exits - but they come with hidden strings. Unlike
traditional VCs who reserve capital for follow-ons and help build
syndicates, corporates rarely lead rounds, move slower with weeks of
approvals, and often push toxic terms like ROFRs that scare off other
acquirers. Another trap is when their strategic agenda conflicts with
maximizing your value - they might block a great exit because the
buyer is their competitor, or vanish overnight when corporate
leadership changes.

 ANDY RACHLEFF EXPLAINS HIS PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY OF "SLUGGING
PERCENTAGE, NOT BATTING AVERAGE" (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 While every other job rewards batting average, startups need a
slugging percentage - take tons of shots knowing most will fail
because the magnitude of your wins matters way more than how often
you're right. 

 GOLD DIGGERS (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Some founders raise money to look for gold, others find the gold,
then raise money to extract it - and you'd better be the second type. 

 SHOULD VCS INVEST IN ‘JOCKEYS' OR ‘HORSES'? (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 VCs often debate whether to prioritize the founder or the business.
