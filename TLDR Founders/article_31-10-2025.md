HEADLINES & TRENDS

 GRAMMARLY REBRANDS TO 'SUPERHUMAN,' LAUNCHES A NEW AI ASSISTANT (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Grammarly has rebranded to "Superhuman" after acquiring the email
client Superhuman and launching an AI assistant called Superhuman Go.
The AI assistant, integrated with Grammarly's extension, connects with
apps like Jira and Google Calendar, enhancing its functionality for
tasks like scheduling and data fetching. With its transition to a
productivity suite, Grammarly aims to compete with Notion and Google
Workspace by offering enhanced AI features. 

 META'S AI PUSH WORKS, BUT WALL STREET ISN'T CONVINCED (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Meta's stock dropped 8% after earnings, even though its AI
improvements are clearly working. People spend 10% more time on
Instagram because of better AI recommendations, and advertisers using
Meta's AI tools pay 14% less per lead. The company now makes $60
billion from AI-powered ads. The problem is expenses - they jumped 32%
as Zuckerberg pours money into AI research labs faster than revenue is
growing. Meta grew revenue 26% and engagement is up across every app,
but investors think it is spending too aggressively on AI when the
current tools already deliver results. 

 $555B OF CLOUD SPEND (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Microsoft and Google's latest earnings reveal the sheer scale of the
AI boom. Together, they're sitting on $555 billion in cloud
commitments. Both companies are doubling down on data centers, pushing
toward a $100B annualized CapEx each. Microsoft plans to expand AI
capacity by 80% and double its data center footprint within two years,
while Google raised its 2025 CapEx forecast to $93B. Microsoft's
commercial backlog has surged past $400B, and Google Cloud's hit
$155B, signaling long-term demand strong enough to justify spending
more than their entire cash reserves.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO KEEP WINNING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Replit's founder says winning is less about luck and more about
surviving long enough to compound. The first rule is simple: don't
die. Know your red lines, manage downside, and stay in the game even
when things look bleak. The second is never quit, progress compounds
slowly until it suddenly doesn't. Easy paths rarely lead to lasting
advantage, so lean into hard problems that others avoid. Winning
requires focus: lock in, study competitors, and learn from their
mistakes. While shortcuts are tempting, playing by the rules forces
innovation that becomes a moat. Finally, give back. Sharing ideas,
open-sourcing work, and helping others doesn't weaken you, it builds
goodwill and compounds success over time. 

 HOW TO FIND YOUR WEDGE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Startups die trying to build everything at once. Founders hear “go
after a big market” and start designing the Maximum Viable Product,
a sprawling vision that burns time, cash, and morale before it ever
meets a customer. The smarter move is finding your wedge: one tightly
scoped problem your small team can solve better than anyone else.
Amazon started with books, and Facebook started with college photos.
Each nailed a small problem and earned the right to expand. 

 WHEN TO HIRE YOUR FIRST PM (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Every founder hits a moment when a product stops being the best use
of their time. The roadmap fills with new features, customer feedback
piles up, and you're juggling sprint planning while trying to close
deals and hire your next engineer. That's when it's time to bring in
your first PM. Before PMF, you should own product yourself, but once
the feedback loops multiply and tactical decisions start eating into
growth, you need someone who can synthesize, prioritize, and keep
momentum.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE CULT OF BUSYNESS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 If exhaustion is your status symbol, you are paying prestige with
your life. This essay skewers our worship of constant doing, where
packed calendars masquerade as meaning and self-care turns into
another productivity hack. Busyness becomes a sedative for anxiety and
a costume for relevance, rewarded with applause even as it erodes
attention, intimacy, and art. The cure is not a better app but
permission to be idle on purpose, to treat stillness as a practice
rather than a failure, and to stop confusing motion with a life. 

 PIVOTS, PATHS, AND PROTOTYPES (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 You know it is time to pivot when perfecting the draft takes longer
than saying what is true. A TEDx prep that would not click becomes the
story of switching themes with a month to spare, proving that quitting
one path can be the bravest way forward. The lesson is to build
“beta” moments into work and life, test fits before committing,
and judge effort by learning rate, not sunk cost. Some turns are not
detours at all. They are the road revealing itself. 

 WILL AI SLOP KILL THE CREATOR ECONOMY? (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Meta's Vibes and OpenAI's Sora 2 are AI tools that generate video
content effortlessly, posing a threat to parts of the creator economy
by replacing roles like fashion models and brand spokespeople. Despite
this, genuine online creators that offer authenticity and unique
insights remain valuable, as AI struggles to replicate these
qualities. The proliferation of AI-generated content could threaten
the media industry by oversaturating the market, but human-driven
content retains its appeal due to its originality.
