 Standard Capital has released standard Series A funding documents
with balanced, consistent terms. Includes term sheet, purchase
agreement, certificate of incorporation, investors' rights agreement,

 THE GREAT IPO AWAKENING: ARE WE BACK? (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Last week saw six companies raise $4.4 billion in five days - the
busiest IPO stretch since 2021. Klarna priced conservatively at a $15
billion valuation, down from its $46 billion peak, but still popped
15% on debut, while Via Transportation quietly raised $493 million
running the software behind 500 million public transit rides annually.
Unlike 2021's froth, these IPOs emphasize actual profitability and
conservative pricing. There's more coming - Stripe at $65 billion,
Databricks at $100 billion, and OpenAI at $300 billion are all
preparing debuts that could deliver $200 billion in combined proceeds.


 NOTHING CLOSES $200M SERIES C LED BY TIGER GLOBAL, PLANS AI-FIRST
DEVICE LAUNCH (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nothing raised $200M in a Series C round led by Tiger Global, valuing
the company at $1.3 billion. With new funding, the company plans to
launch an AI-first device, focusing on AI integration in its operating
system. Despite global challenges, it has achieved significant market
share in India and is expanding its AI capabilities under the
leadership of former Linktree executive Sélim Benayat.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FROM $0 TO $40M ARR: INSIDE THE TECH THAT POWERS BOLT.NEW (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Bolt, the one-prompt app builder that went viral, isn't actually an
overnight success - it's a seven-year grind that finally paid off.
Bolt spent those years building WebContainer, an insane piece of tech
that runs Node.js entirely inside your browser tab. When LLMs got good
enough to generate full apps in 2024, Bolt pivoted from its dying IDE
business and rocketed to $40M ARR in six months with just 15
engineers. 

 WHY WE BUY: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF INCENTIVIZATION (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 You're at a gas station planning to spend $30 on fuel when you spot a
sign offering a $10 gift card if you spend $45. Next thing you know,
you're filling the tank completely and feeling like you won. B.F.
Skinner discovered why we fall for this when he gave rats a lever that
sometimes dispensed food - the unpredictable rewards made them press
it obsessively because dopamine spikes at anticipation, not just the
reward itself. Sephora tosses in free samples knowing you'll come back
for full sizes, Asana randomly shows unicorns flying across your
screen when you complete tasks, and smart marketers reveal surprise
bonuses mid-launch to tip fence-sitters into buying. The right
incentive at the right moment turns "maybe" into "yes" and keeps
people coming back for more. 

 SALES KPIS FOR STARTUPS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sales KPIs for startups should link directly to revenue, focusing on
metrics like lead conversion through the sales funnel. Key
distinctions include marketing-qualified leads (MQLs), who show
interest but aren't ready to buy, and sales-qualified leads (SQLs),
who are prepared to purchase. Understanding customer acquisition cost
(CAC) and conversion metrics allows startups to optimize pricing and
processes for profitability.

MISCELLANEOUS

 "I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO…" (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Identity drives behavior more powerfully than goals - you become "the
type of person who ships code daily" then actually ships daily, not
the other way around. The author quit smoking by declaring himself a
non-smoker first, then acting accordingly, and now deliberately
cultivates 50+ identities from "publishes imperfect art" to "returns
shopping carts" - each one chosen rather than accidentally accumulated
through habit. For startups, this means replacing goals with identity:
instead of trying to reach product-market fit, become "the type of
founder who talks to customers daily"; and instead of trying to raise
funding, become "the type of CEO who builds inevitable companies" -
because once you define who you are, the actions follow automatically.


 AI WILL NOT MAKE YOU RICH (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Generative AI won't create the investor fortunes that personal
computers did - it's more like shipping containerization in 1956,
which revolutionized global trade but made almost nobody rich. Unlike
the PC revolution that surprised everyone and gave startups time to
build moats before IBM noticed, AI faces immediate competition from
tech giants who control the models and limit experimentation. The real
money won't be in AI companies themselves but downstream in businesses
that use AI to cut costs and expand into new markets, though even
these will face brutal competition. Most of the $1-7 trillion in value
AI creates will flow to consumers through cheaper services, not
investors. 

 RIP DIGITAL MARKETING TO HUMANS (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AI agents are replacing humans in digital marketing by autonomously
making purchasing decisions using structured data. Traditional SEO and
web analytics are becoming obsolete as agents bypass traditional
browsing to extract information directly from databases and APIs.
Marketers must now focus on ensuring content is machine-readable to
remain competitive.

QUICK LINKS

 IF YOUR PRODUCT HAS ANY RETENTION AT ALL, YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN REALLY
GOOD SHAPE (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 If your product keeps even 5% of users, you're doing better than most
startups because the default is dropping straight to zero. 

 WHY NOBODY IS BUYING FROM YOU! (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 If your company hasn't landed a customer in over a year despite
having full sales and marketing teams, your product is a want, not a
need, the right prospects don't know you exist, or your sales team is
waiting for leads instead of hunting. 

 GOOGLE HAS ELIMINATED 35% OF MANAGERS OVERSEEING SMALL TEAMS IN PAST
YEAR, EXEC SAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Google cut 35% of managers overseeing small teams to reduce
bureaucracy and enhance efficiency.
