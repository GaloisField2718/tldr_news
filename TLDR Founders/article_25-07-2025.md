HEADLINES & TRENDS

 OPENAI PREPARES TO LAUNCH GPT-5 IN AUGUST (13 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI plans to launch GPT-5 in early August, offering integrated o3
reasoning capabilities and mini/nano versions available through its
API. GPT-5 aims to unify OpenAI's language models and simplify usage
across applications, although it won't reach AGI status immediately.
The anticipated declaration of AGI could impact OpenAI's revenue
agreement with Microsoft. 

 CROWDSTRIKE-BACKED COMPLIANCE STARTUP VANTA VALUED AT $4 BILLION IN
NEW FUNDING ROUND (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Vanta's valuation surged to $4 billion after closing a $150 million
funding round backed by CrowdStrike Ventures. The startup, which helps
companies manage compliance with cybersecurity frameworks like SOC 2
and ISO 27001, serves over 12,000 customers, including tech giants
Atlassian and Snowflake. More investors included Wellington
Management, Atlassian Ventures, JPMorgan Chase, and Sequoia Capital.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO GET RECOMMENDED BY CHATGPT (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI answer engines are becoming the most influential gatekeepers in
B2B buying, with ChatGPT hitting a billion users and 2.5 billion daily
prompts. Buyers now ask AI what to buy instead of researching
themselves - if your product isn't mentioned, it might as well not
exist. Josh Blyskal from Profound found only 11% of citations overlap
between ChatGPT and Perplexity, meaning you need platform-specific
strategies. Reddit is now the most-cited domain at 6% of citations,
and one-in-three citations come from comparative listicles. Almost
half of cited domains shift within a single month. 

 YOUR COMPLETE GUIDE TO REVENUE LEAKAGE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Revenue leakage is the gap between what you should earn and what you
actually collect - the ghost quietly draining dollars through missed
invoices, zombie accounts still getting service, and pilot pricing
that never graduates. It's a systems problem disguised as a people
problem, living in the cracks between sales handoffs and billing
processes. Common culprits include auto-renewals that silently fail,
discounts hardcoded forever, and churned customers still accessing
your product months later. 

 REFRAMING AI CHATBOTS AS SELF-SERVICE TOOLS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI chatbots should be reframed as self-service tools rather than
human support replacements due to their limitations. Achieving this
involves clearly defining their purpose and implementing technical
guardrails to ensure alignment. Understanding AI's capabilities and
limits helps in effectively integrating them into customer support.

pricing trends [9] and how to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving
SaaS landscape. Watch the webinar (ungated) [9] 

 THE SUBSTACK AI REPORT (RESOURCE) [10] 

 Substack surveyed 2,000 publishers and found 45% use AI - mostly men
over 45 in tech/business categories who rely on it for research and
editing, not generating full posts. 

 AI MEETING NOTES BY NOTION (TOOL) [11] 

 AI Meeting Notes by Notion is a tool that transcribes and organizes
meeting notes directly within Notion, synced with your calendar.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ZERO-SUM THINKING AND THE LABOR MARKET (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 College graduates now have higher unemployment rates than the overall
workforce for the first time since 2018 - the opposite of how this is
supposed to work. Young men are struggling most, with 50,000
healthcare jobs going to women graduates while men gained far fewer
positions across all sectors. People are applying to 1,000 jobs and
getting rejected by algorithms in what's become a casino economy where
getting hired feels like winning the lottery. This broken system feeds
zero-sum thinking - the belief that my success requires your failure -
which has replaced the Sputnik generation's positive-sum worldview
where everyone could grow together. 

 THE GENERAL THEORY OF ENSHITTIFICATION (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Enshittification isn't just about social media - it's the natural
lifecycle of any business with network effects. Companies offer great
value to build their user base, then exploit that base once locked in.
Uber's "earnings inflection strategy" jumping from losses to profits
by squeezing customers proves this was always the plan. 

 WHAT FOUNDERS TEACH US (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Founders are river people, not villagers - they thrive in uncertainty
while others choose stability. They see differently: they're fearless
enough to hear "no" constantly but keep asking, they actively seek
contrarians to challenge their thinking, and they know execution beats
strategy. They ignore the right feedback, focus obsessively on
recruiting A-players, and carry unshakable optimism despite knowing
90% of startups fail.
