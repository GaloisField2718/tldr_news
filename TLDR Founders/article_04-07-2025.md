HEADLINES & TRENDS

 ANTHROPIC ANNUAL REVENUE REPORTEDLY REACHES $4 BILLION (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Anthropic hit $4 billion in annual revenue just as two leaders of its
Claude Code product jumped to Cursor, one of Anthropic's biggest
customers. The timing matters because AI companies are desperately
trying to retain talent with salaries up to $690,000. Meta just paid
$14.3 billion for 49% of Scale AI and poached its CEO. When your
biggest customers can afford to steal your best people, vertical
integration suddenly looks less like a moat and more like a feeding
ground. 

 THE $1B LAND GRAB FOR LEGAL TECH'S FUTURE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Clio bought vLex for $1 billion this week, shortly after Harvey
expanded its LexisNexis partnership. Both moves reveal the same
strategy - owning the full legal workflow from research to billing.
The interesting part is how quickly legal data got locked up. Three
companies control most legal data: Westlaw partnered with CoCounsel,
Lexis with Harvey, and Clio now owns vLex. That concentration means
smaller legal tech companies face a choice: find a dance partner or
become one. 

 THE $4.6T SERVICE-AS-SOFTWARE OPPORTUNITY: LESSONS FROM YEAR ONE (11
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI-native startups are creating Services-as-Software companies to
automate entire roles, positioning integration and outcomes as key
differentiators over feature sets. Differentiation now relies on
deeply embedding AI into customer environments, leading to a shift
where pre-sales merge with post-sales, requiring extensive
customization even before contracts are signed. Pricing models are
evolving from access-based to outcome-based, aligning costs with the
value AI delivers, signaling a major shift towards speed-to-value in a
$4.6 trillion market opportunity.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE ART OF COLD-EMAILING A BILLIONAIRE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Over half of billionaires have responded to this founder's cold
emails, including Travis Kalanick and Eric Lefkofsky. Before writing,
spend 90% of your effort figuring out the trade: what you want and
what makes it worthwhile for them. Then hit four principles: establish
competency fast, make your ask clear with the value to them,
transparently state your self-interest, and show extra effort beyond
the email. Most people think cold email is about persuasion when it's
actually about understanding what the recipient values. 

 YOUR COMPLETE GUIDE TO DISCOUNTING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Discounting can harm long-term value if done without purpose,
decreasing margins and encouraging customer churn. Avoid discounts
driven by competitor pricing or unclear product fit, which often
trigger bad customer behavior like devaluing the product. Proper
discount strategies focus on enhancing lifetime value, such as with
big logos or strategic wedges, rather than closing deals fast. 

 LIES PER SECOND, MEETINGS PER DECISION RATIO, AND OTHER IMPORTANT BIZ
METRICS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Your startup is dying when it takes 15 meetings to make one decision,
but traditional metrics won't tell you that. Andrew Chen tracks
organizational health through weird ratios like "Meetings per
Decision" and "PowerPoints per Launch" - inspired by how he measures
everything unconventionally, even ranking activities by death risk
("micromorts"). These metrics catch decay early: healthy teams decide
in 3-5 meetings, dying ones need 20.

MISCELLANEOUS

 IS CHATGPT REALLY ROTTING OUR BRAINS? (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 MIT researchers found that students using ChatGPT showed less brain
activity and couldn't remember a single sentence from essays they'd
just written, while those writing without AI remembered 89% correctly.
However, the study had major flaws: just 54 students writing 20-minute
essays in a lab doesn't reflect real-world AI use. The key is staying
mentally engaged - use AI to challenge your ideas, not replace your
thinking entirely. 

 STOP RUSHING TO RESOLVE TWO COMPETING OBJECTIVES (4 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Most executives hear "grow fast but spend nothing" and immediately
ask, "Which is more important?" That question marks you as a junior.
Senior leaders know that premature resolution kills creative solutions
- the real skill is operating within the tension. Instead of rushing
to pick sides, they ask expansion questions: "What would we need to
achieve both?" The paradox isn't a bug to fix but a feature that
forces strategic thinking. Companies that win hold competing
priorities simultaneously rather than settling for either/or thinking.


 WOULD YOU REGRET LEAVING BEFORE A MASSIVE EXIT? (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Jason Oakley left Verafin in 2015 for a friend's startup, walking
away from stock options that became worth millions when the company
sold to Nasdaq for $2.75 billion in 2021. When friends asked if he
regretted missing out on life-changing money, he said no - learning
and growing mattered more than waiting around for something that might
never happen.
