HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE SAAS MIDLIFE CRISIS - HOW TO REINVENT YOURSELF LIKE INTERCOM/FIN
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SaaS unicorns with $100-300M ARR face a growth crisis as public
software companies slow while AI startups like Anthropic hit massive
numbers. Intercom shows the reinvention playbook - its AI agent Fin
went from $0 to $100M ARR in 2.5 quarters, potentially boosting its
valuation from $1.25B to $3B and proving you can re-horn yourself
without killing the core business. 

 CIRCLE'S VALUATION IS GETTING NUTTY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Circle's stock rocketed from $31 to $227 per share despite generating
“only” $578.6 million in Q1 revenue for a $48.4 billion valuation
that gets even wonkier after splitting USDC economics with Coinbase. 

 AI TALENT WARS BRING UNPRECEDENTED PAY PACKAGES AS META THROWS DOWN
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta is offering unprecedented compensation packages, ranging from $8
million over four years to $20 million annually, primarily in stock,
to attract elite AI talent. This move intensifies the recruitment
frenzy in the already competitive AI talent market. Despite these
lucrative offers, Meta faces challenges in poaching top researchers
from rivals like OpenAI.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RUTHLESS PRIORITIZATION WHILE THE DOG PEES ON THE FLOOR (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Time is zero-sum, so you can only do 1-10% of what needs doing, and
it forces a binary choice between 10x tasks that transform your
company and 0.1x tasks you must eliminate or delegate. The hardest
part isn't choosing priorities, but explaining why you're letting
important fires burn while focusing on what matters most - which looks
insane to employees who don't understand the complete strategic
picture. 

 WHY MOST FOUNDERS FAIL TO RAISE IN 2025 AND HOW YOU WON'T (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Most fundraising advice is two years outdated or written by people
who haven't raised a cent. The new reality requires treating
fundraising like targeted sales, not hope - start with 25 precisely
chosen VCs who are actively deploying, sequence outreach to build
momentum, and use your deck as a weapon to create urgency rather than
an academic presentation that explains everything politely. 

 HOW PAGERDUTY PREPARED FOR IPO (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 PagerDuty's 2019 IPO emphasized enhancing customer trust over mere
valuation gains. It went public at $100 million in revenue to reassure
enterprise clients of their stability and credibility. The preparation
involved focusing on essential one-time tasks like filing an S-1,
splitting efforts between short-term IPO activities and long-term
operational excellence.

 A FUNGIBLE WORLDVIEW (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Cluely raised $15M from a16z with a series of viral marketing
tactics: hiring strippers, getting kicked out of Columbia for building
cheating tools, and marketing with the tagline "cheating on
everything" - then converting the controversy into enterprise
contracts. This exemplifies how a venture's pursuit of scale creates a
"fungible worldview" where individual choices matter less. 

 ASSESSING THE REAL IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON JOBS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 MIT economist David Autor found that automation exposure doesn't
equal job loss by tracking task changes from 1977 to 2018 - Uber
drivers saw 249% employment growth despite wage stagnation while
proofreaders earned more but fewer jobs existed. The key insight is
expertise fungibility: experts can do nonexpert work when displaced,
but automation's impact depends on whether it removes routine tasks
while adding abstract ones or strips away what makes a job
specialized.

 THE SHAPE OF THE ESSAY FIELD (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 People don't know things for three reasons: it's unimportant, they're
obtuse, or they're inexperienced. 

 WHAT EARLY GTM BENCHMARKS ARE TELLING US (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Only 40% of startups achieved 4x pipeline coverage in Q1 2025, and
CAC payback is getting worse with 50% of sub-$5M ARR companies hitting
under 12 months but zero companies in the $10-50M range managing that
timeframe. 

 IS ARR GROWTH DURABLE? (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Goldman Sachs now defines "high growth" as just 20% revenue growth,
but many SaaS companies are masking deeper problems by juicing numbers
with price increases, M&A, and new product launches.
