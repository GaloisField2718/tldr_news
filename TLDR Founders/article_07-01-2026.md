VENTURES, RILLET, AND CLARIFY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most first-time founders don't know if they're ready to hire, who the

investors from MENLO VENTURES, RILLET, AND CLARIFY.

offer templates used by founders who've hired from META, ATLASSIAN,

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 EVERYONE IS EXCITED ABOUT CLAUDE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 We are watching the democratization of competence in real time. The
excitement around tools like Claude Code is about the sudden
acceleration of human potential. We are crossing a threshold where
software no longer just assists but actively up-levels the user,
allowing a mid-level engineer to perform like a senior architect. This
signals a massive explosion in software creation from people who
previously lacked the technical skill to build what they could
imagine. 

 HOW AI MADE PRICING HARD AGAIN (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The per-seat model is dying, and nobody knows what will replace it.
For twenty years, SaaS pricing was easy: count the humans and multiply
by thirty dollars. AI breaks this because its entire purpose is to
reduce the number of humans needed to do the work. We are returning to
an era of complex, value-based pricing.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR #1 JOB FOR JANUARY? DEPLOY AN AI AGENT — YOURSELF. HANDS ON
KEYBOARD (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sales, marketing, and GTM leaders need to learn how to deploy their
own AI agents. The leaders who will win in the AI era are those who
have done the work themselves. While AI jargon may be intimidating,
the actual work isn't that hard. This post provides some tips on how
to deploy a fully custom AI agent. 

 THE AI PRODUCT DESIGN PLAYBOOK (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Your model is not your moat. In a world where intelligence is a
commodity, the only defensible advantages are proprietary data and
deep workflow integration. AI-first startups often fail because they
obsess over the tech rather than the user pain. The winning design
pattern is not a chatbot - it is a system that absorbs a messy,
complex human workflow and makes it invisible. If your product is just
a text box, you are just a wrapper. 

 HOW TO BUILD A WAITLIST (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A waitlist is not a parking lot - it is a validation engine. Most
founders treat waitlists as a collection of email addresses, but they
are actually a tool for testing promises. You do not need a product to
build one - you just need a clear, specific promise of an outcome. The
goal is not to get ten thousand signups - it is to start twenty real
conversations with people who feel the pain so acutely they are
willing to wait for the cure.

 MERCOR'S ASCENDANCY IN AI SPARKS DISCUSSION ON THE FUTURE OF WORK (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Mercor has rapidly emerged as a key player in AI. It recently
achieved a $10 billion valuation and raised $350 million in Series C
funding. The startup aims to provide high-skilled contractors tailored
for AI labs and address AI development's increasingly sophisticated
needs. This shift highlights evolving workforce demands and raises
questions about future job competitiveness in an AI-driven economy. 

 THE CASE FOR ABUNDANCE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Doomerism is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The current narrative around
AI safety often acts as a filter, scaring away the exact thoughtful,
conscientious builders we need while leaving the field open to the
reckless. Abundance - of code, intelligence, and art - should be the
default state of the future. You do not get a vote on how that future
is shaped by refusing to participate in the present. Optimism is a
moral imperative to ensure the good version gets built. 

 THE STARTUPS ARE THRIVING (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Recent startups are achieving unprecedented growth rates,
significantly outpacing traditional T2D3 metrics to attract investor
interest. Companies like Serval, Runware, Rillet, Yoodli, and FAL
reported exponential increases in ARR, showcasing robust traction in
the AI sector. This rapid growth underscores a shift in how startups
secure capital, setting a new baseline for performance amid escalating
competition.
