 SHIP THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATIONS WITHOUT REBUILDING OAUTH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Every integration comes with the same overhead: OAuth flows, token
storage, refresh logic, and provider-specific quirks. It's tedious,
time-consuming, and pulls your team away from core product work.

WorkOS Pipes [5] handles all of it. Services like GitHub, Slack,
Google, and Salesforce connect through a drop-in widget [6]. Your
backend makes one API call for a valid token. Pipes handles the rest.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 SOFTWARE IS DEAD…AGAIN! (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cloud software valuations have cratered to 10-year lows, with the
median NTM revenue multiple hitting 4.1x. Investor confidence in the
SaaS business model is fracturing as AI disruption risks threaten the
retention rates and terminal value assumptions that powered the last
decade of software investing. The path back requires companies to
prove stable retention over multiple quarters. 

 LEADERS, GAINERS, AND UNEXPECTED WINNERS IN THE ENTERPRISE AI ARMS
RACE (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 a16z surveyed 100 Global 2000 CIOs and found OpenAI still leads
enterprise AI with 78% production usage, but Anthropic posted the
largest share gain at +25% and now sits at 44% penetration. The
surprise winner in enterprise apps is still Microsoft, not the
startups dominating tech Twitter. Average enterprise AI spend rose
from $4.5M to $7M and is expected to hit $11.6M this year.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE BEST AI STARTUPS DO THE TRAINING FOR YOU. IT'S ON YOU TO MAKE THE
AGENT AWESOME — NOT YOUR CUSTOMERS (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The old model was to sell the software and let the customer figure it
out. Businesses now need to do the work to make their AI great before
they hand over the keys. AI agents will fail if improperly contained.
It is up to the AI vendor to make it work. Customers shouldn't have to
get agents to work. 

 WHAT TAM SHOULD ACTUALLY TELL YOU (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stop calculating “potential customers × potential price” and
start with what the world currently spends solving your problem.
That's your actual market today. Everything beyond that isn't market
size, it's a thesis about growth. Most founders are stacking 3-5
speculative theses without realizing it, and since each compounds risk
exponentially (30% × 30% × 30%), understanding this can dramatically
improve how you allocate time and opportunity cost. 

 HOW PRODUCT DISCOVERY CHANGES WITH AI (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI has collapsed the cost and time of building and testing products,
which means feasibility, viability, and usability are no longer the
hard parts: desirability is. The critical bottleneck in product
discovery is now understanding what customers actually want. Teams
need to shift investment toward deeper customer insight and research
to answer the fundamental question before building anything.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LOYALTY IS DEAD IN TECH (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Big Tech has figured out how to acqui-hire without the acquisition.
License the IP, hire who you want, leave the rest behind. No
regulatory review, no shared outcomes. Microsoft did it with
Inflection, Amazon with Adept, and Google with Character AI. The
unwritten oath between founders, employees, and investors is dead.
When picking your next company, ask your VC who else they've backed in
your category and what happened to employees at the founder's last
company. 

 THE ORIGINS OF GENERATIONAL COMPANIES (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Microsoft, Oracle, NVIDIA, and Starbucks all started by selling
something to a tiny, often invisible market before stumbling into
bigger opportunities. The playbook isn't “envision a radically
different future and build it,” it's figure out a real need by
selling, learn by iterating on what doesn't work, avoid trying to
predict the future or convince markets, and stay in the game long
enough to catch a demand wave when it hits.

QUICK LINKS

 RETHINKING SLACK (20 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Slack faced issues with feature bloat and complexity by late 2019, as

than as a blind directive. 

 REVISITING CLARITY OF THOUGHT (13 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Clarity of thought stands as a key differentiator for successful
founders, influencing all aspects from hiring to sales. 

 TRADITIONAL ADTECH IS DEAD. LONG LIVE ADTECH FOR AI 📣 (12 MINUTE
READ) [22] 

 AI could create a new form of advertising that may actually flourish.


 B2CC - CLAUDE CODE IS YOUR CUSTOMER (13 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 We are now shifting into an 'agents as customers' era - companies

prefer.
