HEADLINES & TRENDS

 META AIMS TO HIRE AI INVESTORS NAT FRIEDMAN AND DANIEL GROSS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Meta wants to partially buy out VC fund NFDG and hire its partners
Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross to lead AI efforts. The move - part of
Zuckerberg's "founder mode" push that includes nine-figure signing
bonuses to poach OpenAI talent - would give Meta minority stakes in AI
startups like Perplexity and Safe Superintelligence without getting
insider information. 

 MICROSOFT'S BIG STICK ERA (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Microsoft is prepping another round of layoffs targeting "thousands"
of sales roles after cutting 6,000 jobs in May despite 13% revenue
growth and spending $107 million daily on shareholders. The company
feels secure enough to play hardball with OpenAI. It is reportedly
willing to walk away from restructuring talks and let the partnership
expire in 2030 rather than bend to demands. 

 VC FUND PERFORMANCE Q1 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Recent venture funds are struggling to return cash with just 37% of
2019 funds and 30% of 2020 funds generating any distributions for LPs
by Q1 2025. The market has shifted toward smaller funds, with 42% of
2024 vintage funds under $10 million versus 25% in 2020. The median
IRR for 2017 funds sits at 11.5%, with massive variation from 5% at
the 25th percentile to 28.3% at the 90th.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW WE ONBOARDED CLAUDE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This YC company treats Claude like any new engineer, with a formal
onboarding doc (CLAUDE.md) checked into source control that gets
updated whenever Claude does something dumb. The result is Claude now
handles chunks of the company's engineering work, creating GitHub
issues and PRs while following strict workflows to avoid its favorite
failure modes like committing to main, claiming it tested code it
can't run, and ignoring documentation completely. 

 HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST AI TOURISTS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI demos go viral then churn hard. One growth leader saw 70-80%
opt-out rates on experimental AI revenue. Annual plans boost net
revenue retention by 10-20 percentage points versus monthly, but
forcing them backfires with 10-14% refund rates. The winning tactics
include making annual the default pricing display, offering exclusive
AI credits upfront, and targeting upgrades in month two when customers
are 3-4x more likely to convert. 

 HOW VANTA WENT FROM 1 TO 100 (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Vanta hit $10M ARR before its Series A by staying under the radar,
then scaled to $100M+ by moving upmarket with design partnerships and
enterprise sellers. Its CPO spends daily time using the actual product
and its CRO runs weekly forecast reviews debugging every part of the
GTM funnel. Vanta structures product teams around three time horizons,
from immediate growth to moonshot exploration.

MISCELLANEOUS

 IS HARVEY BUILT TO LAST? (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Harvey parlayed early GPT-4 access into a $100M+ valuation through
genius branding over product quality. It won deals with 50-100 seat
pilots that generated press releases, but multiple firms reported that
Legora beat it in head-to-head product comparisons. Harvey's
raise-and-burn strategy worked until challengers like Legora kept
shipping better features faster than Harvey could catch up. 

 THE IMPACT OF VIBE-CODING & AI ON VENTURE CAPITAL AS AN ASSET CLASS
(4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 One solopreneur just sold his AI product Base44 to Wix for $80M after
six months, proving the next unicorn could be built over a weekend.
VCs now face explosive noise at the top of funnel plus compressed time
to product-market fit, forcing a shift from Pre-Seed → Seed →
Series A to just two stages: Pre-PMF (bootstrapped) and Post-PMF
(massive rounds in hyper-competitive markets). 

 FOUNDERS FUND: THE DISCIPLES (17 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Peter Thiel's Founders Fund thrived despite Thiel not being a
traditional manager due to the contributions of key figures Napoleon
Ta and Lauren Gross. Ta led successful growth investments while
remaining low-profile, and Gross expanded the firm's AUM into
billions. Thiel's network also birthed Valar Ventures and Mithril
Capital, each playing unique roles in Thiel's broader investment
strategy.
