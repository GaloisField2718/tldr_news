 WORKOS: MAKE YOUR APP ENTERPRISE READY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Modern products move fast—until you try to sell to an enterprise.
Suddenly you need SSO, SCIM, audit logs, and more [4] just to get
through the door.

That's where WorkOS comes in. With just a few lines of code, you can
drop in all the enterprise features IT teams expect—and start
closing bigger deals, faster.

OpenAI, Cursor, and Vercel all use WorkOS to scale upmarket.

Make your app Enterprise Ready today. [4]

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 MODELS AREN'T MOATS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The AI market feels frothy - startups are raising at astronomical
valuations despite minimal revenue. With foundation models becoming
commoditized, three signals separate winners from losers: talent
density, brand strength, and data feedback loops. Startups can copy UI
and rent compute, but they can't easily replicate a fast, tight
proprietary loop trained on millions of live, structured interactions.


 AI AVATARS ESCAPE THE UNCANNY VALLEY (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI avatars are evolving beyond basic lip-syncing into dynamic,
expressive characters with full-body movement, emotional nuance, and
real-time interaction. As quality improves, they are transforming
content creation, marketing, and communication for consumers, SMBs,
and enterprises. 

 THE HIDDEN VALUE IN THE AI APPLICATION LAYER (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The big news this week is OpenAI's rumored $3 billion acquisition of
coding assistant Windsurf. The reason a model company paid so much for
an application isn't just about diversifying revenue streams - these
coding assistants generate incredibly valuable proprietary data about
how developers write and choose between code suggestions - data that's
far more useful than what's available in public repositories. This
creates a feedback loop where better applications capture better data,
which trains better models. We'll likely see this pattern repeat as AI
labs rush to acquire applications in biology, healthcare, and legal
fields, where private data is even more scarce and valuable than in
coding.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SSEBITDA: A BETTER PROFIT METRIC FOR SAAS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 For SaaS companies "spending to grow," SSEBITDA (Steady-State EBITDA)
reveals whether your core business model actually works by measuring
profitability if you maintained current revenue without growth. The
formula—EBITDA + Sales/Marketing - Cost of Cancellation—improves
on earlier metrics by accounting for customer churn replacement costs.
This shows not just if you're profitable now, but whether you'd be
profitable in steady-state. The related "Profitable Growth Rate"
calculation tells you exactly how fast you can self-fund growth while
staying profitable. Watch this metric directionally rather than
obsessing over the absolute number, especially if you're seeing
improvement in the component inputs over time. 

 STARTUPS (STILL) AREN'T BUSINESSES (YET?) (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Silicon Valley follows two laws: Richard Sutton's "bitter lesson,"
which says overwhelming compute beats clever logic, and Silicon
Valley's understanding that startups aren't meant to be businesses
that make money steadily—they're assets designed to be sold for huge
sums all at once. Despite the recent wave of efficient AI startups
like Arcade ($5M revenue with 5 employees) and Genspark ($10M in nine
days), the fundamental model hasn't changed. Windsurf is reportedly
selling to OpenAI for $3 billion after building a profitable coding
tool with a small team, which confirms that even the most efficient
modern startups aren't being built to keep their profits. The goal
remains to sell shares, not generate cash flow. "Efficiency" is just
today's trendy scale on which startup shares are weighed. 

 BRADLEY TUSK SAYS HE MAKES MORE MONEY WITH ‘EQUITY-FOR-SERVICES'
THAN HE DID AS A TRADITIONAL VC (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Tusk Venture Partners has declared traditional VC dead and is
shifting to an "equity-for-services" model to help startups with
regulatory challenges. It will continue supporting its current
portfolio until 2031.

 Build ML models from a problem description. 

 ZENCODER (TOOLS) [12] 

 Zencoder is an AI coding assistant that helps developers ship faster
with deep context awareness and 20+ integrations. 

 BOLT X FIGMA (TOOLS) [13] 

 Bolt x Figma turns any Figma design into a full-stack app in one
click—perfect for rapid prototyping and production-ready builds.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WTF IS A MARKET DISLOCATION? (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Market dislocations happen when prices stop making sense—when asset
values disconnect from fundamentals due to economic shocks, policy
surprises, or investor psychology. Unlike recessions, dislocations
signal that the market's pricing mechanism is temporarily broken.
Think of it like driving on black ice: the car spins unexpectedly, but
may keep moving down the road afterward. We're seeing this now in bond
yields and equity volatility. While not a crisis, these moments
require extra vigilance—watching metrics closely, maintaining
liquidity, and being prepared for unexpected shifts. 

 THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF MONTHLY SAAS RENEWALS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Annual contracts that renew month-to-month create unique tradeoffs
for SaaS companies. While this approach eliminates renewal friction,
it impacts three key areas: valuation, cash flow, and customer
commitment. If your churn remains low, the model works, but consider a
hybrid approach for larger accounts where offering incentives for
annual renewals or charging premiums for monthly flexibility can
optimize for both customer satisfaction and business stability. 

 WHEN CHURN IS THE MODEL (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Some businesses like dating apps and services that aid company
closures are designed for high churn since their market involves
one-time customer interactions. Unlike the traditional recurring
revenue model prioritizing retention (like SaaS), these models focus
on capturing immediate demand and rely on new user influx rather than
loyalty. SimpleClosure, which emphasizes rapid execution and immediate
customer satisfaction, exemplifies this by serving a constant market
need as hundreds of thousands of U.S. businesses close yearly.
