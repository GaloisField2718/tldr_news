HEADLINES & TRENDS

 MARC LORE'S WONDER RAISES ANOTHER $600 MILLION (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Food hall startup Wonder raised $600 million in new funding, pushing
its valuation above $7 billion just months after acquiring Grubhub.
CEO Marc Lore plans to double its current 46 locations by year-end,
expanding its model of serving 30 restaurants from a single kitchen
with under 30-minute delivery times. 

 FIGMA'S BIG AI UPDATE TAKES ON ADOBE, WORDPRESS, AND CANVA (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Figma launched four new products that let designers complete entire
projects without jumping to other apps. These tools—Sites for
website building, Make for AI coding, Buzz for marketing assets, and
Draw for vector illustration—directly challenge Adobe, WordPress,
and Canva while making Figma an all-in-one platform. 

 Y COMBINATOR'S SUMMER 2025 REQUESTS FOR STARTUPS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 YC has released its newest "ideas we'd like to see founders tackle"
list, focusing heavily on AI applications from full-stack AI companies
to voice assistants. Its top requests include AI personal tutors,
robotics software tools, healthcare administration automation, and
companies that turn designers into founders.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BUILDING A HIGH-VELOCITY (AND HIGHLY AUTOMATED) SALES MOTION (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Pylon's sales engine defies SaaS norms—its AEs close up to 30 deals
monthly without any outbound prospecting, driving $2M ARR per rep
annually. Its streamlined approach automates everything: inbound leads
book demos that instantly populate its CRM, conversations move to
Slack instead of email, and trials start right after demos. This 1-6
week sales cycle delivers 95% gross retention and 140% net retention. 

 THE UNSUNG INGREDIENT IN STRIPE, SQUARE, AND LINEAR'S SUCCESS (12
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 As AI evens the playing field, your "taste" matters more than ever.
Stripe, Linear, and Square don't just preach quality—they build
systems to scale it: review checkpoints at 20% and 80% completion,
dedicated "red pen holders" for quality control, and creating
"remarkable products" not just viable ones. Their playbooks work
because they've turned subjective taste into objective processes that
extend their vision to every customer touchpoint without slowing down
execution. 

 HOW FOUNDERS SHOULD THINK ABOUT RUNWAY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most founders are in a dangerous middle zone: more than 12 months of
cash but not enough to hit metrics needed for their next round. Smart
founders track monthly burn religiously, understand which expenses
actually drive growth, and plan for 12 months beyond their fundraising
target. The market has changed—raising on story alone doesn't work
anymore when investors expect 3-4 years to reach your previous
valuation milestone.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE TRUE COST OF CHURN (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Churn kills your business in ways most founders never calculate.
Sometimes as founders we assume there's always a new topline to chase,
but preventing churn might actually be your biggest revenue
opportunity hiding in plain sight. When a $150K customer churns in
year one, you're not losing just that revenue—you're watching nearly
$1M in lifetime profits evaporate. Factor in the "silent snowball" of
unhappy ex-customers steering deals to competitors, and that single
lost account potentially costs you $3.3M in total value. 

 THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITY IN THE WORLD IS FRICTION (6 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 We now live in three different worlds—digital experiences remove
all effort, physical infrastructure falls apart from neglect, and
wealthy people create bubble neighborhoods where friction becomes
aesthetic. AI writes your essays while airport systems fail 700 times
weekly. The rich get smooth experiences while everyone else deals with
broken systems. This shift moves effort around rather than eliminating
it, dumping the hardest work on those with least power to refuse it.
Maybe we should see friction not as an enemy but as a signal showing
exactly what needs fixing in our economy. 

 THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS ON SERIES AS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Private market valuations follow public market trends but with a
delay and reduced impact. Nasdaq returns influence Series A
valuations, with changes manifesting six months later and explaining
only 7.5% of the variance. Interest rates have a stronger correlation,
significantly affecting venture activity as they drop.
