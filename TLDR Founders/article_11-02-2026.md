 HYBRID TEAMS SPEND 11% OF THEIR DAY IN AI TOOLS, BUT MEETINGS ARE
STILL EATING PRODUCTIVITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 How are global teams actually getting things done?

Hubstaff set out to answer that question based on a metric ton of data
- anonymized, aggregated patterns across 140,000 workers and 17,000
organizations [4].

You can get the full report here [4] but for a sneak peak:

→ AI adoption is a done deal, now used by 84% of hybrid teams

→ Meetings are still on the rise, including many meetings that could
have been a Slack message

→ App sprawl is unreal, with teams toggling 18-36 on a daily basis

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE GREAT SOFTWARE CORRECTION OF 2026 (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 IGV dropped 28% from its September peak. Microsoft cratered 12% in a
single day despite beating earnings. Oracle is down 56%. It's not a
temporary panic - it's the market finally pricing in a structural
shift where AI eats into the application layer and seat-based pricing
models start to break down. Whether you agree or not, every founder
selling software should understand the argument. 

 WHAT FOLKS ARE REALLY VIBE CODING TODAY (18 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The top use cases for vibe coding in businesses right now are rapid
prototyping without waiting on engineering, building internal tools
that match processes and needs, turning slide decks into real,
interactive presentations, and replacing simple SaaS with custom-built
solutions. Vibe coding is eliminating the gap between having an idea
and seeing it work. People who need tools are now the ones building
them.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR PRODUCT SHOULD PROVE ITS VALUE IN UNDER 60 SECONDS (10 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Most products lose users because nothing meaningful happens early
enough. Users are looking for a reason to believe. Products must earn
confidence before asking for effort. Otherwise, users simply
disengage. 

 THE GROWTH META: EVENTS AS A GROWTH CHANNEL (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Events should be a central part of a launch strategy. They are wildly
underutilized by early-stage founders. Events are one of the highest
leverage go-to-market activities. In person and live is a different
type of magic - there's no way to automate a handshake.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE CASE FOR SCALING VENTURE (21 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Top venture firms argue that scaling VC to raise massive funds is
essential as more startups require significant capital to compete in
today's market. The abundance of larger companies and increasing
private valuations mean VCs must adapt, focusing on supporting
founders with resources beyond just financial backing. 

 RENTED VIRTUE (20 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A Quaker lit a blast furnace in 1709 and accidentally started the
Industrial Revolution. The businesses that endure across generations
have something at their center that can't be justified in purely
secular terms. The AI megacycle will produce more overcapitalized
companies seeking an identity than any boom in history. The ones that
last will look, to outside eyes, irrational.

QUICK LINKS

 FEARLESS VS. COURAGEOUS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Most people assume the best founders are fearless, but the opposite
turns out to be true - the great ones feel fear acutely and act
anyway. 

 BETTING THE COMPANY (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Critical business moments require decisive action, often risking a
company's future on one key decision. 

 $340B IN VC, BUT FEWER DEALS THAN ANY YEAR THIS DECADE (5 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 $340B flowed into US VC-backed companies in 2025. 

 THE 3 CURVES THAT MAKE A SCALABLE BUSINESS (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 You want users and revenue to grow exponentially, bugs per day to
grow linearly, and support work to grow logarithmically. 

 WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE (14 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Improvement happens with less drama, fewer surprises, faster
decisions, and clearer handovers when you consistently convert 'good'
into artifacts and defaults.
