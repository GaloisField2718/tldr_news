HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE AI ACQUI-HIRE WAVE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Between 2020 and 2025, there were 5,700 AI acquisitions - and 79% of
them never disclosed a price. That's 4,500 quiet talent grabs where
small teams got absorbed into bigger companies with zero fanfare.
Accenture leads with 21 AI acquisitions (only three disclosed). Apple
has 17 (two disclosed). The 75th percentile deal size tripled from
$82M to $248M. Forget the billion-dollar headlines - the acqui-hire
wave is the real story of AI M&A, and almost nobody is paying
attention. 

 2026 TECH PRIVATE MARKETS ANALYSIS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Caplight analyzed ~5,000 closed secondary trades, and the numbers
should make every founder rethink their timeline. AI startups are
reaching $1B valuations in 3.4 years - half the 7-year average.
Secondary volume hit $3.5B in 2025, up 75% YoY. Cursor, Perplexity,
and ElevenLabs hit liquid secondary markets within 3 years of
founding. Of the 20 largest IPOs in 2025, 14 were below their IPO
price by year-end.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TRACKSUIT'S ROCKET RIDE: FROM BOOTSTRAP TO SERIES B SUCCESS (15
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Two Kiwi founders watched McKinsey-type firms charge $200K+ for brand
tracking and decided to kill that market. They talked to 100 marketers
with zero product and refused to build anything until 10 committed as
beta customers. Their first product was a white-labelled Power BI
dashboard. The move that defined them was hand-delivering gray
tracksuits to early customers. Not merch - it was the "t-shirt
theory." Customers started posting LinkedIn photos wearing them,
creating an organic referral flywheel nobody planned. A few years
later, they reached $42M ARR. 

 CLARITY OF THOUGHT (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Clarity of thought is the strongest founder signal because it drives
judgment across hiring, sales, and fundraising, independent of
near-term outcomes. The best founders anchor ideas in first
principles, define terms precisely, and present a clear conceptual
framework that makes complex decisions feel obvious and coherent. This
clarity enables fast, credible evaluation, lets others remember the
company as a distinct idea, and compounds trust even when details are
still evolving.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TOKEN ANXIETY (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 More and more developers are spending less time socializing and more
time monitoring their agents' progress. People are leaving events
early just to go back to work. They're waking up and checking their
agents' progress before their coffees and texts. The fact that
developers can do more now is causing anxiety, as the window to be
first at anything feels like it is shrinking by the day. 

 THE 2026 SAAS CRASH ISN'T AI KILLING SOFTWARE - IT'S BUDGET
REALLOCATION (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Hyperscalers will spend $470B+ on AI infrastructure in 2026, and that
money is coming straight from software budgets. The threat isn't AI
replacing the product - it's AI reducing the headcount that uses the
product. If 10 agents do the work of 100 reps, you don't need 100
Salesforce seats. CIOs are consolidating, not expanding. The "best of
breed" era is over. This isn't the death of SaaS - it's the end of
easy SaaS. 

 INTENTION IS ALL YOU NEED (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The next 30 years will belong to the systems that own the shared
intent that's required to orchestrate action and outcomes. These
systems will define, coordinate, and accomplish the work to be done.
Today's systems will become inputs that feed a system organized around
an outcome. Each industry must discover abstractions and create
legibility - the platforms that do so will win.
