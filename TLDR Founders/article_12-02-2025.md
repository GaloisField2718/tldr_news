 PREVENT BILL SHOCKS & GAIN CONTROL OVER YOUR OBSERVABILITY SPENDING
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Pricing models for observability platforms tend to be intentionally
complicated. They combine the number of hosts, users, data volume, and
signals, into one incomprehensible milkshake.

The result? Costs are difficult to understand, difficult to control,
and most organizations end up overpaying.

DASH0 DECIDED TO GO WITH A RADICALLY SIMPLER APPROACH [5]:

 	* $0.2 per million metric data points 
 	* $0.6 per million spans or span events 
 	* $0.6 per million log records

No hidden fees. No surprises. Just simple, transparent pricing that
gives you full control.

better, on the Dash0 blog [4].
