HEADLINES & TRENDS

 ANTHROPIC RAISES $13B SERIES F AT $183B POST-MONEY VALUATION (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic raised $13 billion in a Series F round, valuing the company
at $183 billion. Significant investors include ICONIQ, Fidelity, and
Lightspeed. This funding will support growing enterprise demand,
safety research, and international expansion. 

 VIJAYE RAJI TO BECOME CTO OF APPLICATIONS WITH ACQUISITION OF STATSIG
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has acquired Statsig and named its founder, Vijaye Raji, as
CTO of Applications. Raji will oversee ChatGPT and Codex engineering.
The acquisition strengthens OpenAI's experimentation capabilities,
enhancing product development and responsiveness. Statsig will operate
independently in Seattle, with continuity for current customers. 

 WHEN SHOULD FOUNDERS SELL THEIR SHARES? (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Secondary sales hit $162 billion in 2024, up 45% from the previous
year, with founders increasingly cashing out small portions during
funding rounds - Revolut's CEO just sold $200-350 million while
companies like Stripe, Databricks, and OpenAI run regular employee
liquidity programs. The old taboo against founder secondaries has died
because IPOs now take 10+ years, and founders need basic financial
stability, but the key is moderation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FROM ZERO TO $25B IN 17 YEARS: THE INSIDE STORY OF HUBSPOT'S
DOMINATION STRATEGY (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 HubSpot's success stems from its focus on predictable, compounding
growth through inbound marketing and platform development. Expanding
from a marketing automation tool to a comprehensive system of record,
HubSpot increased customer retention and ARPU. Strategic acquisitions
and significant R&D investments further solidified its position,
creating sustainable competitive advantages and continual growth. 

 YOUR COMPLETE GUIDE TO REVENUE LEAKAGE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Revenue leakage, the gap between potential and collected revenue,
often occurs due to system misalignments across sales, finance, and
customer service. Common causes include missed invoices, unintended
discounts, churned customers still receiving service, and untracked
credit memos. Identifying and addressing these leaks is crucial for
maintaining revenue integrity and ensuring organizational efficiency. 

 WHY TODAY'S BEST CFOS THINK LIKE FOUNDERS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Modern CFOs act as business operators, focusing on turning capital
into outcomes rather than just financial reporting. They prioritize
strategic judgment, guide growth decisions, and align business metrics
with execution goals. A CFO who thinks like a founder can provide
clarity amidst startup chaos, enabling faster, more effective
decision-making.

 BUILDING A 60% AI TEAM: EFFICIENT, PROFITABLE, AND SURPRISINGLY
LONELY (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 SaaStr has transitioned to a workforce comprising 60% AI,
significantly boosting efficiency and output at a reduced cost. Key
functions handled by AI have tripled content production, managed over
100,000 chat interactions, and built substantial sales pipelines. The
