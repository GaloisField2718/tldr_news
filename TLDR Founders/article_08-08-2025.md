 WHAT COMPANIES LIKE OPENAI ARE DOING DIFFERENTLY WHEN IT COMES TO
PRICING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Everyone's scrambling to figure out the right pricing model for an
age where software completes tasks autonomously.

↘️ Legacy operators use rigid pricing systems and manual
processes. They struggle with execution because every change breaks
something, and every experiment requires months of coordination.

↗️ Companies like OpenAI use monetization as a competitive
advantage. They respond to market changes in real time, adjust pricing
faster than competitors [4], and configure new packaging models
instantly as customers request them.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 INTRODUCING GPT-5 (17 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI's GPT-5 boasts superior intelligence and performance across
coding, writing, and health-related tasks. It significantly reduces
hallucinations and sycophancy, providing more accurate and reliable
responses. GPT-5 Pro, a variant for complex questions, delivers even
higher expertise. New functionalities allow users to customize
interactions and improve real-world applications. 

 GPT-5 HANDS-ON: WELCOME TO THE STONE AGE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GPT-5 marks the "stone age" for AI. It doesn't just use tools - it
thinks with them, like humans first learning to shape stones changed
everything. Testing showed it one-shotted dependency conflicts that
stumped every other model by using yarn commands like Deep Research
uses web search, iterating and reasoning through problems instead of
just guessing. While it's worse at writing than GPT-4.5 (producing
more "LinkedIn slop"), it's unequivocally the best coding model -
creating entire production-ready websites with SQLite databases in one
shot, where other models gave scaffolding or plans, automating
software engineering from maybe 65% to 72% in one leap. 

 THE HIGH COSTS AND THIN MARGINS THREATENING AI CODING STARTUPS (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI coding startups face high costs and thin margins due to expensive
LLMs, with Windsurf failing to sustain profitability, leading to its
sale. This competitive market pressures companies like Anysphere and
Replit, which depend on reducing their LLM supplier costs or
developing in-house models. Startup valuations have been impacted, and
many struggle to remain independent amidst rising operational expenses
and direct competition from suppliers like OpenAI and Anthropic.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHEN FOUNDERS CLASH (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It doesn't matter how much you raise or how good your product is,
co-founder fights kill more startups than competition or running out
of money ever will. Four months after raising from Perplexity's
founder, AI startup Astra shut down - not because its product failed
or money ran out, but because its co-founders couldn't agree on
whether to wait for Fortune 500 deals or pivot to faster sales. The
company had everything going for it: two enterprise beta clients,
backing from prestigious investors. However, while one founder wanted
those logos and the other wanted speed, their startup bled out during
the argument. 

 HOW TO BUILD DIFFERENTIATED AGENTIC AI PRODUCTS: A PRACTICAL GUIDE (9
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Building agentic AI products involves determining the appropriate
level of system autonomy, starting small with structured workflows,
and integrating domain-specific logic for differentiation. Focus on
tying AI efforts to actual business value and use open-source
frameworks for efficiency. Ensure reliability and effectiveness
through rigorous unit and integration testing. 

 RAISING PRICES HAS ITS PLACE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE ONE OF YOUR BEST
IDEAS. (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Raising prices shouldn't be a primary growth strategy, especially
during slow growth periods. It's often a desperate tactic that doesn't
attract new customers and can drive them to competitors. The solution
is to focus on acquiring more customers, not extracting more revenue
from existing ones.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ARE WE READY FOR AI SALES REPS? (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 RB2B's founder replaced his two-person sales-assist team with a
$99/month AI clone of himself that handled 1,683 conversations in 22
days - and the results were... exactly the same as before. The AI
handles 90% of buyer questions (demos, pricing, and SOC2 docs). While
it hasn't boosted conversions yet, it frees the founder to spend 30-60
minutes daily reviewing conversations for product insights instead of
paying two salaries. 

 IN PRAISE OF QUITTING (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A former lawyer quit right before making partner and shut down her
startup when it wasn't going to have the impact investors expected -
and says quitting is her superpower. Life is like tournament poker,
where you get one stack of chips, so don't waste them on barely
positive-value bets just because you're afraid to fold. Most founders
stay too long in failing ventures because quitting feels like locking
in a loss, but here's the reframe: imagine you were instantly
unsubscribed from everything in your life, then ask what you'd
actually subscribe to - you'll find most of your current activities
wouldn't make the cut. 

 WHAT'S WORTH WANTING? (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Most of us chase things we don't actually want - we're copycats
suffering from Mimetic Desire, unconsciously modeling our ambitions
after what we see others wanting on Instagram and LinkedIn. The author
realized his first startup was theater for other people, driven by
founder models he looked up to and wanting to make his entrepreneurial
dad proud, not what he actually wanted. Real desires are simple - work
3 hours daily on something meaningful, stay healthy, help people, and
love family - but we get tricked into thin desires like viral posts
and VP titles because we mistake someone else's articulation for our
own resonance, so the key is developing taste by noticing what drains
you versus what you do when nobody's watching.

 THE SUNK COST FALLACY (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 We finish terrible movies because we've already watched 30 minutes,

spent so much - the sunk cost fallacy makes us throw good money after
bad.
