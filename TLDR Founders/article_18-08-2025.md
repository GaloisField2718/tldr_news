 5 HARD-LEARNED LESSONS ABOUT SCALING PRICING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Remember when you could ship a pricing change in an afternoon? Then
you scaled, and suddenly every pricing tweak needs an engineering
ticket, a sprint, and a prayer that nothing breaks in production.

This blog post reveals key pricing insights by three high-growth
companies [4] (DataStax, Fly .io, and Starburst) — and what they did
when their legacy billing infrastructure started breaking.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 TECH IPOS ARE ROARING AFTER 'YEARS OF PROHIBITION' (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Tech IPOs are booming with Bullish's IPO, backed by Peter Thiel,
surging 84% on debut. Figma and Circle also saw significant first-day
gains, reigniting interest in tech IPOs after a lull due to previous
market conditions. Concerns arise over potential mispricing and the
sustainability of these gains, reminiscent of the dot-com era. 

 OPENDOOR CEO RESIGNS FOLLOWING INVESTOR PRESSURE CAMPAIGN (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Opendoor CEO Carrie Wheeler resigned following investor pressure
after failing to reassure a turnaround in the company's quarterly
earnings report. Hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, a vocal critic, and
co-founder Keith Rabois influenced the decision. Opendoor named CTO
Shrisha Radhakrishna as interim leader while searching for a new CEO,
as the stock rose significantly since its June low. 

 GALAXY LANDS $1.4B FOR HELIOS DATA CENTER EXPANSION AS COREWEAVE
COMMITS TO 800 MW (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Galaxy secures $1.4 billion to expand its Helios data center in West
Texas for AI and HPC capabilities. CoreWeave commits to using all 800
MW of power capacity, with operations starting in 2026 under a
long-term deal.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FOCUS ON FULL FUNNEL SEO NOT JUST THE TOP (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SEO teams obsess over rankings and traffic, but ignore what happens
after someone clicks. This kills SEO's value when clicks decline. The
fix is full-funnel SEO that follows the entire customer journey.
Activation SEO targets searches like "how to import contacts into
[product]" - boring queries that determine if trials convert to paid.
Retention SEO mines support tickets for friction points. When
frustrated users Google problems before calling support, you'd better
rank for those queries or Reddit will. Expansion SEO helps existing
customers upgrade by ranking for tier comparisons and referral
searches. The real measure of SEO is about being present with helpful
answers at every critical moment. 

 GETTING STARTED WITH USAGE-BASED PRICING (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI features create a pricing nightmare because some customers barely
touch them while others 10x their usage overnight. Kyle Hart built
Toast's pricing playbook from $0 to $100M ARR and says customers claim
they want usage-based pricing but actually hate the variability. His
approach is similar to how you'd test a new feature. First, audit what
you have - which features do reps discount most? What are customers
actually using? Then, form 2-3 mock pricing pages to test in real
sales calls. Slowly build your conviction over time before making the
swap. 

 WHAT TO DO MORE (AND LESS) OF (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Most teams know what good product development looks like, but can't
figure out why they're not doing it - the answer isn't what to add,
it's what to stop. The author studied high-performing teams and found
they create space for the right behaviors by killing the wrong ones.
They weave context into every discussion instead of jumping straight
to solutions and pretending they know everything. They ship meaningful
progress weekly instead of getting stuck in analysis paralysis for
months. They question year-old commitments instead of blindly
executing plans made when everything was different. For your next
product planning session, try asking, “What would we need to stop
doing to make room for what matters?”

MISCELLANEOUS

 PRODUCT WON'T END AT CHAT (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI capabilities have run so far ahead of product design that we could
stop all model development today and still have years of work left.
Everyone's bundling everything into chat apps, but chat sucks for
depth, workflow, and longitudinal data. There's a reason AI code
generators are IDEs, not text boxes. We'll see the same unbundling
that happened with Craigslist - horizontal chat platforms will
disaggregate into deeper, purpose-built apps. Any guidebook or
professional guide is a candidate for standalone AI apps that go
beyond chat. The optimal product has yet to be discovered, but chat
won't cut it. 

 WHY THE VENTURE CAPITAL SECONDARY MARKET IS BOOMING IN 2025 (7 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 While everyone waits for the IPO window to reopen, secondaries
quietly hit $152 billion in 2024, up 39% year over year. What started
as a liquidity hack is now essential infrastructure. LPs tired of
waiting can sell their fund stakes. Founders can give employees
partial cash-outs without forcing an IPO. GPs spin their best
companies into continuation vehicles to hold them longer while still
returning cash. The numbers are wild. VC secondaries jumped from 16%
of deal activity in 2020 to 29% in 2024. Secondaries aren't a
workaround anymore. They're how venture capital actually works when
traditional exits take over a decade. 

 SF TECH CEO OFFERS BUYOUTS TO LET WORKERS FLEE 'EXTREME' WORK CULTURE

commit to an all-consuming environment. Wu accelerated share vesting
schedules and laid off 30 staff, leaving 200 workers to decide on the
buyout.
