HEADLINES & TRENDS

 STATE OF CONSUMER AI 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 a16z has released a ranking of the top 100 consumer AI apps. The
ecosystem is stabilizing - there were only 11 new names on the web
list, compared to 17 last time. ChatGPT still leads by a wide margin,
but Google's Gemini and xAI's Grok are closing the gap. The more
interesting finding is what's working. Vibe coding startups Lovable
and Replit both debuted on the main list. 22 of the top 50 mobile apps
were developed in China, but only 3 are primarily used there. Only 9%
of consumers pay for more than one AI subscription. 

 THE END OF INTERCHANGE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The interchange fees that make up much of the cost of the credit card
system are eventually going to go away. The interchange fee model is
vulnerable to disruption from stablecoins, bank-to-bank direct
payments, Pay by Bank platforms, and cryptographic identity layers in
ACH. It is still an open question whether stablecoins or retrofitted
ACH/bank rails will win, how fraud and reversibility concerns will be
addressed, and what the timeline is for meaningful interchange
compression.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE TOP REASONS I SAW CROS FLAME OUT THIS YEAR (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 CROs can't just be managers with playbooks. To be successful, they
need to be closers who learn, leaders who show up, and executives who
stay when it gets hard. They need to personally close deals and be
familiar with products, as well as understand their partner channels.
A good CRO visits their major teams in person because they know that
culture gets built in person and trust is earned face-to-face. 

 THE LAWYER MOST B2B STARTUPS DON'T REALIZE THEY NEED UNTIL FAR TOO
LATE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Startups that bring on contract counsel generally see their overall
sales cycle reduced. Founders signing at least two enterprise
contracts a quarter should consider bringing on contract counsel. It
will save the startup money and often help close deals faster. Having
counsel will help startups avoid ending up with terms that let
customers take advantage of them or create problems later down the
line, like during an acquisition. 

 THE 13 TACTICS BEHIND LOVABLE'S INSANE GROWTH (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Lovable went from $0 to $100M ARR in 8 months with 45 employees and
almost no paid acquisition. That's $2.2M revenue per employee - the
industry benchmark is $200k. The playbook was running 12+ growth
channels simultaneously while competitors struggled with one or two. A
Product Hunt launch drove GitHub stars. GitHub credibility led to
podcast invitations. The flywheel required no paid advertising to
maintain.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DESIGNERS OF PROBLEMS WORTH SOLVING (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The best founders aren't solving obvious problems - they're designing
problems worth solving. The distinction matters because finding
meaningful problems may be more important than solving them. The
approach involves reframing situations through expansion and elevation
until the problem aligns the founder's purpose with how society and
technology are changing. This lens helps identify founders who have
the agency for entrepreneurship, even if their ideas seem "unfundable"
by consensus standards. 

 SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FACE A NEW INTERMEDIARY (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Many years ago, Amazon tried to build its own device to escape
Apple's control. AI companies now see personal devices as a way to
escape the App Store tax and to own the user relationship. These
companies don't want to live at the mercy of operating systems they do
not control. Creating their own devices will allow them to own their
own destiny rather than ask Cupertino for permission. 

 SOME THOUGHTS ON "HEAD OF NARRATIVE" (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This essay explores why tech companies are suddenly paying $300k+ for
"heads of storytelling" and whether it actually works. Anthropic is
offering up to $400k for a "Head of GTM Narrative." The author's
skepticism comes down to one thing: companies are extensions of their
founders. Public perception of Anthropic is downstream of Dario,
regardless of what a narrative lead says.
