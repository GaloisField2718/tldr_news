HEADLINES & TRENDS

 CONTEXT GRAPHS COULD BECOME AI'S NEXT TRILLION-DOLLAR PLATFORM (12
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AI agents expose a missing enterprise layer: decision traces that
capture exceptions, approvals, and precedent that never make it into
systems of record. Startups that sit in the agent execution path can
persist these traces at decision time, forming context graphs that
explain not just what happened, but why it was allowed. This shifts
power away from CRMs and data warehouses toward new systems of record
built around decision lineage and autonomy. 

 THE COORDINATION TAX (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The structural logic for knowledge work is moving toward smaller
teams with larger AI support. Companies that recognize this will
operate at cost structures their competitors cannot match. Executives'
value will lie in judgment, not coordination. The agent built from
years of direct context that exists nowhere else is irreplaceable.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THIS WEEK ON HOW I AI: HOW TO GET YOUR WHOLE TEAM EXCITED ABOUT AI (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Brian Greenbaum, product designer at Pendo, became an AI advocate
after a Slack message on paternity leave, leading workshops and
implementing tools across teams. His approach includes rapid
experimentation with AI tools and offers a playbook for organizational
adoption, enhancing creativity and strategy influence. Becoming an AI
champion, as Greenbaum emphasizes, significantly boosts career
opportunities. 

 THE LAST PRODUCT TO GET CANCELLED (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The 'vitamin vs painkiller' metaphor is a prime example of perfect
hindsight, non-actionable startup advice. No founder sets out
intending to build a vitamin, it's just difficult to come up with
actionable tests of what's what. This article presents some concrete
tests to help founders create more certainty. The advice is likely
most helpful for B2B founders currently navigating product-market fit
and early sales.

MISCELLANEOUS

 $3B TO ZERO - HOW LUMINAR COLLAPSED (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Austin Russell became one of the youngest self-made billionaires when
Luminar went public in 2020. By December 2025, the lidar company filed
for Chapter 11. This article digs into what happened in between -
Luminar bet everything on Volvo, which kept expanding its order from
39,500 sensors to 1.1 million over three years. Then, Volvo made lidar
optional instead of standard, cutting volumes by 90%. There's a lot to
unpack here about concentration risk, why "lifetime volume"
projections aren't the same as purchase orders, and what happens when
your only customer changes their mind. 

 THE REAL ECONOMICS OF SAAS VERSUS AI COMPANIES (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI companies need higher revenue or pricing power to match SaaS
profit per customer due to structurally lower margins. AI can tap
larger budgets, but must rely on volume, pricing power, and
efficiencies in costs like compute to be competitive. The math hasn't
changed, only the economic inputs have, making understanding these
differences crucial for evaluating financial outcomes in AI versus
SaaS.

 THE SHAPE OF THE GAME WE PLAY (20 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The rapid interest rate hikes in 2022 reduced global liquidity,
causing many startups to struggle or fail, highlighting the shift from
a low-cost capital environment. 

 WHY $1-10M ARR IS THE HARDEST (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Martin Roth, revenue leader at Levelset, breaks down what actually
changes as sales teams scale, where teams tend to overcorrect, and why
structure and incentives still beat tools, even in the current AI era.
