 THE TAX MISTAKES FIRST-TIME FOUNDERS KEEP MAKING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most first-time founders don't think about taxes [4] until it's too
late. By then, a wrong entity structure or a mishandled stock option
grant can mean thousands in unnecessary tax liability.

Carta put together a free webinar [4] with CPAs from Kruze Consulting
to walk through the essentials. It's designed for founders who'd
rather be building product than deciphering IRS forms.

The video covers:

 	* Staying compliant from day one (without a full-time accountant)
 	* Setting up your entity for tax efficiency
 	* How ISOs, NSOs, and RSAs actually work — and what that means for
you and your team

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 LONG LIVE SYSTEMS OF RECORD (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Everyone keeps saying AI agents will kill systems of record. The
opposite might be true. Ask sales what your ARR is, and you get one
number. Ask finance, and you get another. Humans can talk it out -
agents can't. The more we automate, the more someone needs to decide
what the correct answer actually is. 

 THE REAL STATE OF SEED TODAY: THE TOP 10 LEARNINGS FROM 50,000
STARTUPS, PER CARTA'S LATEST DATA (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The seed market is healthy but bifurcated. AI companies are operating
in a different universe than everyone else, who is competing for a
smaller share of attention with leaner teams and longer runways. SAFEs
have become completely standardized, and solo founding is increasingly
viable, but remains a handicap for fundraising. The fundamentals are
still the same: build something people want, get to metrics that
matter, and raise when you have the leverage. 

 THE AI VALUE GAP: WHERE DOES THE $7,000 PER SEAT GO? (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 OpenAI claims that AI saves the average white-collar worker 54
minutes per day. Currently, vendors capture 10% to 15% of that value,
leaving employers and employees with 85% to 90% value capture. This
gap suggests that significant pricing power remains untapped. Bundling
further complicates the picture - there appears to be a market for
best-in-class vertical tools even when bundled alternatives exist. 

 THE AGE OF COMPOSABLE SOFTWARE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Software has always faced a brutal trade-off - you can have
customization or affordability, never both. Affordability always won.
That's why personal computers were never really personal, and most
apps follow "one codebase to rule them all." AI changes this math so
dramatically that the trade-off might finally break down. Instead of
killing software, AI could make it infinitely personalized - built for
an end-market of one.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PLAY RIGGED GAMES (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Unfair advantages come in three flavors: product insight,
go-to-market edge, or technical moats. One common thread among
successful founders is an obsession that rational people would walk
away from. They solved problems they couldn't stop thinking about.
Find your edge and stop fighting fair. 

 HOW MUCH EQUITY CAN YOU GIVE TO EMPLOYEES BEFORE IT'S A PROBLEM? (6
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The median public tech company spends 12% of revenue on stock-based
compensation. Sounds outrageous until you see that actual shareholder
dilution is under 2%. The math is simple - SBC is measured against
revenue, dilution against market cap. A company trading at 4x revenue
spending 12% on SBC only dilutes 3% of market cap. The companies
getting killed aren't spending 20% on SBC. They're the ones growing 5%
while pretending they're still a growth story.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AI PULLS VC AND PE INTO THE SAME ORBIT (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI is transforming labor-heavy service sectors, putting SMB and
mid-market businesses within reach for tech startups and collapsing
the historical divide between venture capital and private equity. PE
funds are becoming distribution channels for AI products, while
founders use PE portfolio pages as idea maps as AI expands TAM for
legacy software categories. AI native rollups accelerate the
convergence as VC-backed platforms acquire traditional services firms
and rebuild them around automated operations. 

 THE MAP IS NOT THE TERRITORY (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 VCs treat the power law like a selection tool when it's actually just
a description of what happens after the dust settles. They look at
seed-stage startups and ask, "Is this a power law company?" - but
that's a category error. Uber looked like a black car service for rich
people. Airbnb was for travelers who couldn't afford hotels. Both got
passed because investors couldn't model a $10B outcome. The irony is
that power law returns almost always come from market creation, not
capturing predictable share of existing markets. 

 ESSENTIAL AI INTEGRATION BEST PRACTICES FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE (29
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Implement migration patterns in AI API calls to maintain flexibility
and reliability amid frequent model changes. Utilize service tiers
like OpenAI's Flex for cost-efficient backend operations, cutting
expenses by up to 50% without sacrificing data quality. Employ rate
limiting and circuit breakers to manage resource usage effectively and
mitigate unexpected costs or abuse in AI systems.
