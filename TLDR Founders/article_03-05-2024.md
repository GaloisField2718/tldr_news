HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THEY JOINED AN ACCELERATOR AND LOST THEIR STARTUPS (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The bankruptcy of the Newchip accelerator led to the auctioning of
warrants in over 1,000 startups, causing founders like Lacey Hunter of
TechAid to lose control over their companies and, in some cases, shut
down. Newchip's collapse, amid allegations of mismanagement and a
toxic leadership style by CEO Andrew Ryan, has left many entrepreneurs
facing financial and legal challenges, with some fighting to reclaim
their companies' futures. 

 HOW AI APPS MAKE MONEY (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In recent years, the majority of AI applications have adopted
traditional subscription-based pricing models, with a focus on
per-user charges, reflecting their role as digital assistants rather
than replacements for human workers. Innovative pricing strategies,
such as outcome-based models, are emerging among newer AI companies,
potentially enhancing customer adoption and revenue by charging only
for successful results. 

 KNOW WHAT YOU BELIEVE (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Belief is the foundational element that drives startup founders to
persevere through challenges and convince others to join, invest, and
buy into their vision despite the inherent uncertainties of building a
new business. This conviction must be layered across various aspects
of the startup, from the team and the problem they aim to solve to
understanding the market and timing, all while continuously testing
and refining these beliefs to navigate toward success.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ONBOARDING YOUR CMO (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Onboarding a new CMO requires thoughtful planning and support from
the CEO to set them up for success. Key steps include endorsing the
CMO, facilitating deep customer exposure, providing critical resources
and context, dedicating time together, aligning on strategy and goals,
and helping them navigate company culture and dynamics. By investing
time and effort into a comprehensive onboarding process, the CEO can
empower the CMO to make a significant impact and drive the company's
marketing efforts forward. 

 HOW NOTION DOES MARKETING (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Notion's meteoric rise can be attributed to a multifaceted marketing
strategy that leverages community, influencer partnerships, and growth
analytics. By empowering users to evangelize the product, partnering
with creators to reach new audiences, and optimizing the user journey
to drive conversions, Notion has built a powerful marketing engine
that sets it apart from competitors. 

 HOW I THINK ABOUT DEBT (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Japan is home to 140 businesses that have survived for over 500
years, with some even surpassing the millennium mark, demonstrating
remarkable resilience through numerous adversities such as wars,
natural disasters, and economic downturns. These enduring enterprises,
known as "shinise," typically maintain substantial cash reserves and
avoid debt, a strategy that has enabled them to navigate centuries of

 WRITER-BUILDERS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The concept of the "writer-builder" archetype highlights individuals
who integrate writing into various professional domains, enhancing
their ability to reflect, innovate, and communicate effectively. This
archetype, seen as a modern renaissance persona, thrives on the
synergy between constructing (building) and expressive reflection
(writing), suggesting a growing trend towards interdisciplinary skill
sets and the blending of creative and technical fields. 

 THE SHINY TOY SYNDROME (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The constant desire to try new tools and technologies, known as the
shiny toy syndrome, can lead to temporary satisfaction but ultimately
hinder productivity and long-term performance. To combat this
syndrome, it's important to implement strategies such as a cooling-off
period, ask yourself why you want to try something, consider switching
costs, use a decision matrix, reflect on decisions to ensure
intentionality, and focus on what truly supports your creativity and
goals. 

 YOUR CUSTOMERS AREN'T ENGAGING WITH YOU BUT THAT'S OKAY (7 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Social media engagement doesn't always correlate with customer
activity. Many users may passively observe without interacting but
still respond positively to direct offers. Building a visible presence
and maintaining consistent communication can attract both active
participants and silent observers, ultimately enhancing business
opportunities.
