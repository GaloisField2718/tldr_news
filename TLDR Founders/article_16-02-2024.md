MISCELLANEOUS

 SCALING PRODUCT & GROWTH TEAMS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 As a company grows, finding the ‚Äúright‚Äù structure for product and
growth teams often proves to be elusive. The ideal structure may be
counterintuitive at first: a tangled cross-functional team with
engineers, PMs, and designers all doing a little bit of everything all
at once. 

 ARE PIPS ARE CRUEL AND UNUSUAL? (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Performance improvement plans, an HR relic of the 80s, have recently
resurfaced in the tech industry after the hiring boom of 2021 and

QUICK LINKS

 SLOW DOWN TO SPEED UP (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 As entrepreneurs, we tend to pack our schedules with activities.
Here's a quick reminder that creating buffer time can help you and
your team achieve much more. 

 PREFERENCE STACKS IN VENTURE CAPITAL (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Preference stacks matter, a lot. When a company exits with $200M
after a $50M investment, investors with a "1x preference" get $50M
upfront, while those with a "2x preference" get $100M upfront,
impacting how the rest is divided among founders and employees. 

 LESS IS MORE (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The title speaks for itself: limit meetings, shorten emails, cut down
memos. Do less to do more.
