HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE PALANTIRIZATION OF EVERYTHING (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Job postings for forward-deployed engineers are up 800% this year as
startups copy the model Palantir pioneered. However, most companies
copying the aesthetic are setting themselves up to become expensive
services businesses with software valuation multiples. Palantir works
because there's a real platform underneath the bespoke work. If you
only copy the embedded-engineer part without a strong product spine,
you end up with Accenture for X with a nicer front-end. The question
isn't how we become Palantir - it's what's the minimum forward
deployment we need to bridge the AI adoption gap, and how quickly can
we convert that into a platform business. 

 OPENAI WILL START TESTING ADS IN CHATGPT (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI plans to test ads in ChatGPT's Free and Go tiers while keeping
model responses independent from advertising. Ads will appear as
clearly labeled, separate units, and advertisers will not access user
conversations. Paid Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will remain
ad-free, preserving a clean experience for paying users. 

 THE FUTURE OF ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The business model for software will have to evolve. Enterprise
systems will have to support a more consumption and usage-based model
as AI agents don't cleanly fit seats on software. There will likely
continue to be seats for users within software, with AI agents paying
more for extended usage. A lot still needs to happen before we fully
see what the future holds for enterprise software.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW YOU PACKAGE IS HOW YOU SELL (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Last year, there were 1,800 pricing changes across 500 SaaS
companies, and the fastest-growing ones are updating pricing multiple
times per month. If you aren't used to iterating on pricing, that
probably feels daunting. This post breaks down a new book on the topic
with three core ideas. First, PLG and SLG don't compete, they compete
with each other. Second, pricing metrics must pass two tests: would
the customer feel you've earned more of their wallet as usage scales,
and can a new sales rep explain it in 15 seconds without slides?
Third, limits are the connective tissue of GTM. 

 HOW TO UNDERSTAND CUSTOMERS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 If you don't have firsthand customer intuition, you will only build
the right thing if you get lucky on the millions of decisions it takes
to build a great product. Last year, forward-deployed engineers were
all the rage. In 2026, the goal should be to forward deploy everyone.
The GTM founder talks to customers, tries to explain what they learned
to the technical founder, and something gets lost in translation. That
cycle repeats with more formal writeups, more prototypes, more
frustration. Translation errors compound until you're building
something nobody wants.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PLATFORM OF PLATFORMS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Humans used to be the connective tissue between systems of record.
You'd grab information from Systems A and B, use it to update System
C, then take action. Now agents do that work. This creates a problem
for legacy SaaS. Existing systems of record work great in their own
domain, but have no access outside it. If you're building right now,
the opportunity isn't competing with legacy SaaS, it's the layer that
sits on top. 

 ZAPIER'S CEO SHARES HIS PERSONAL AI STACK (3 MINUTE READ) [14]

evaluation agents. He emphasizes hands-on AI experience for leaders,
