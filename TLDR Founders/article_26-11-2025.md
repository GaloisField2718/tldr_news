the ingestion, transformation, quality checks, and orchestration. Your
report ships in minutes..

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 PRIVATE EQUITY: THE NEW DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL FOR AI STARTUPS (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Private equity firms are rapidly becoming key distribution channels
for AI startups, offering access to a mid-market profile that
accelerates sales cycles. AI tools that cut costs and automate
workflows fit well with PE's profit motives, creating efficient
deployment across portfolios. This model transforms go-to-market
strategies, allowing AI startups to reach over 14,000 PE-backed
companies, bypassing traditional enterprise sales approaches. 

 MOATS BEFORE (GROSS) MARGINS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Investors obsess over gross margins, but Apple has a 38% margin -
roughly half of most software companies - and it's one of the most
valuable businesses on earth. Margins don't determine great companies,
moats - like Network effects, economies of scale, brand power, and
switching costs - do. In the AI era, the obsession with high margins
is even more dangerous. It might just mean your product isn't using
any AI at all.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PRODUCT EVALS IN THREE SIMPLE STEPS (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Building evals can result in immediate payoffs. They allow you to run
multiple experiments to iterate to a working product quickly. Having

human annotations after each configuration change. This post details
how to build product evals. 

 ESSENTIAL SAAS METRICS FOR A SERIES A FUNDRAISE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Key metrics for a SaaS Series A fundraise include Annual Recurring
Revenue, Monthly Recurring Revenue, and Year-over-Year growth, which
demonstrate traction and scalability. Investors also focus on metrics
like Customer Acquisition Cost, Lifetime Value, Net Revenue Retention,
Gross Revenue Retention, and Burn Multiple to assess efficiency and
growth potential. Understanding and effectively presenting these
metrics can enhance credibility with investors and improve valuation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SOME NOTES FROM THE CEO OF SPOTIFY (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This thread contains tips given by the CEO of Spotify during a
two-hour-long presentation. Spotify made the legal option faster and
easier than piracy, and it only widened its focus when its core was
working. It built a reusable distribution engine and let teams own
outcomes. The company invested early in experimentation infrastructure
and was built for global from day one. It only bets on AI when it
moves core metrics. The key to the company's success was focus,
compounding iteration, and small autonomous teams with real
accountability.
