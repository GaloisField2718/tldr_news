HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE DARK SIDE OF SALES (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 As Charlie Munger famously said, ‚ÄúShow me the incentive, and I will
show you the outcome‚Äù. Incorrect incentives can have second-order

to look out for.

ROUND (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There‚Äôs a lot of debate about whether raising capital or

 ASSET-LIGHT SOFTWARE BUSINESSES: THE NEW PARADIGM FOR STARTUPS (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In the late 2010s, startups were advised to raise substantial venture
capital for fixed costs like software and sales, but this paradigm is
shifting towards variable costs and asset-light models, driven by the
commoditization of software and advancements in generative AI. This
transformation is challenging traditional venture capital models,
creating new opportunities for business developers and hyperscale
cloud providers in a more variable cost-driven software industry.
