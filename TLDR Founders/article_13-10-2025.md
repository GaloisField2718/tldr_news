HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE CHATGPT APP STORE MOMENT (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI just launched apps inside ChatGPT where you can say "Spotify,
make me a playlist" or "DoorDash, order my usual" and it handles
everything conversationally. This looks like early iPhone web apps,
not true native experiences yet, but the trajectory is clear. As
OpenAI expands its SDK to give developers access to user memory,
persistent state, and action execution, we'll see actual native
ChatGPT applications designed for conversational interfaces. 

 CLAUDE CODE PLUGINS NOW IN PUBLIC BETA (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic has introduced plugin support in Claude Code, allowing
users to install custom slash commands, agents, MCP servers, and hooks
with a single command. These modular extensions simplify setup sharing
and enable flexible customizations for development workflows. 

 KALSHI RAISES $300 MILLION, VALUING PREDICTION MARKET STARTUP AT $5
BILLION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Kalshi raised $300 million in funding, valuing the prediction market
platform at $5 billion, with plans to expand into 140 countries.
Despite Kalshi's recent growth and surpassing Polymarket for weekly
transactions, skeptics note it isn't fully on-chain. Meanwhile, rival
Polymarket, valued at $9 billion, is preparing to re-enter the US
market after a regulatory boost.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW A 13-PERSON STARTUP SCALED TO MILLIONS IN ARR (5 MINUTE READ) [7]


 A 13-person startup hit seven figures without product managers,
tickets, or hiring people with fancy resumes. Credal's founders worked
at Palantir and noticed almost nobody there started with four years at
top companies, so they hired hungry people instead of credentialed
ones. Engineers own business results directly, set aggressive weekly
goals, and review everything at Friday meetings, where nothing is off
limits. Zero enterprise customers have churned, they keep over 100% of
revenue from existing clients, and landed MongoDB and NBC Universal.
They figure out what outcome they want first, then work backwards to
get there, ignoring whatever startup advice is popular on Twitter. 

 LAZY STARTUP MARKETING VS. TOP 1% GROWTH TACTICS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Andrew Yeung critiques weak early-stage marketing like generic posts,
podcasts, or ads without strategy. He highlights top operators who
build personal brands, communities, and email funnels while capturing
and converting mass attention. The best marketers engineer virality,
create amplification networks, and even design negative CAC channels
that pay them to promote. 

 THE PRICING RATIO: A TRICK TO ESTIMATE CHURN IN 10 SECONDS (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 You can guess a competitor's churn rate by dividing their annual
price by monthly price. Most subscription companies eventually price
their annual plan right above where average users quit paying monthly.
Codecademy struggled with 4-5 month retention, so it priced annual at
6 months of monthly payments and saw huge wins. Hemingway Editor
charges $25 monthly but $100 yearly, a ratio of 4, suggesting most
users bounce after 3 months. ChatGPT has a ratio of 12, Canva sits at
10. The math works because companies learn to lock in users just
before they'd naturally churn.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TINY RECURSIVE MODELS FOR VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEMS (3 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Samsung just showed you can beat massive LLMs on structured puzzles
using a 7 million parameter model trained on only 1,000 examples per
task. Its Tiny Recursive Model uses one small 2-layer network that
loops over itself, refining both its reasoning state and current
answer each pass. It hits 87% on extreme Sudoku, 85% on hard mazes,
and 45% on ARC-AGI benchmarks, often beating models thousands of times
larger. 

 THESE ARE THE SPEEDIEST COMPANIES TO GO FROM SERIES A TO SERIES C (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Generative AI startups top the list of fastest fundraisers going from
Series A to C in under a year, with Anysphere and Cognition leading
the pack. Fintech and spacetech companies also see rapid funding, with
firms like NomuPay and Impulse Space securing hefty investments
quickly. Other sectors such as vertical AI, robotics, and biotech are
also witnessing accelerated fundraising, highlighting investor
enthusiasm across diverse tech domains. 

 NVIDIA TO THE RESCUE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Intel just got a lifeline from an unlikely source. After handing
Uncle Sam a 10% equity stake to unlock government grants, Intel will
see Nvidia buy $5 billion of shares at $23.28 each. The deal spikes
Intel's stock 27% and pairs Nvidia's GPUs with Intel's CPUs in data
centers and PCs.
