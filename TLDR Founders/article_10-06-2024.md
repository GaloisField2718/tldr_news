HEADLINES & TRENDS

 MANY Y COMBINATOR STARTUPS ONLY WANT TINY ROUNDS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In 2024, many Y Combinator startups are opting for smaller seed
rounds of $1.5 million to $2 million with higher valuations, often
avoiding traditional institutional investors. This trend, driven by a
desire to give up less equity, is challenging for VCs who typically
seek a minimum 10% ownership, and it may lead to startups being
undercapitalized for future growth stages. 

 THE VIBES ARE WEIRD (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Silicon Valley's evolution from a nerdy rebel haven in the early
years to a get-rich-quick ecosystem between 2015-2021 reflects the
tech world's cyclical nature. Where are we now in the cycle? Everyone
is talking about AI optimism, but under the hood, there's still
caution in the air. Amidst this tumult, founders face the challenge of
navigating a shifting landscape where traditional success markers
dissolve. The key takeaway? In an era where AI redefines industry
boundaries, adaptability, and a forward-looking mindset are crucial
for survival and success, founders should continuously innovate or
risk obsolescence. 

 NVIDIA CEO DOESN'T DO 1<>1S (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, challenges traditional management by
shunning 1-on-1s, advocating for transparency and collective learning
with his 60 direct reports, arguing it flattens corporate hierarchies
and enhances team-wide growth. Can you imagine the ATRs?

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BREAKING THINGS DOWN (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Big goals are really just a collection of small goals. Break daunting
tasks into smaller, manageable goals. Start small, like writing a
single post or securing one customer, to gradually build momentum.
This approach simplifies large projects, making ambitious goals more
achievable without being overwhelmed. 

 WHY AES NEED TO BE GENERATING THEIR OWN PIPELINE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 As an early-stage founder hiring your first enterprise AE, you can't
expect marketing or BDRs to magically fill their pipeline from day
one. Help set them up for success by encouraging them to leverage
internal networks for support, meticulously organize outreach efforts,
and maintain consistent, personalized communication with prospects.
Doing the hard prospecting yards matters. 

 HOW TO FUND GROWTH & WHEN NOT TO (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Smart capital allocation is crucial for growth. Capital allocation is
a core responsibility, but too often decisions are based on overly
certain projections. Companies have four levers to fund
growth‚Äìgrowth capex, discretionary opex, working capital, and M&A.
As you scale, adopt a structured capital allocation process to
rigorously evaluate organic and inorganic growth investments. Push
your team for realistic ranges and probabilities, not just point
forecasts.

 HOW TO WRITE HIGH-QUALITY ARTICLES THAT ATTRACT SEARCH ENGINES (1
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A simple framework for positioning your written content in order to
attract more interest to your startup. 

 THE PRE-SEED ROUND DEFINED: HOW TO SUCCEED AS AN EARLY-STAGE STARTUP
(15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Pre-seed has emerged as the gateway round for venture-backed
startups, but expectations are evolving rapidly. DocSend's new
Pre-Seed Startup Index provides benchmarks on what it takes to win
pre-seed funding in today's environment. 

 BEYOND BENCHMARKS 2024 (40 MINUTE READ) [12]

released its first annual "Beyond Benchmarks" report. Drawing on
proprietary data from 600+ software startups, the report provides

MISCELLANEOUS

 BIFURCATING BUDGETS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Software budgets are splitting into two camps: AI-related spend,
which is growing rapidly, and "legacy" spend, which is flat to
shrinking. Buyers are scrutinizing every dollar to assess if it
advances their AI agenda. Software companies are struggling as sales
cycles lengthen from this budget bifurcation. To win, vendors must
clearly articulate how they future-proof customers for an AI-centric
world or risk being perceived as "legacy" and losing out on budget. 

 BUILDING AI PRODUCTS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Navigating the buggy terrain of an online visa application led to a
deeper dive into the challenges and potentials of using Generative AI
(like ChatGPT) for precise tasks. The key takeaway? While AI's
error-prone nature today seems like a drawback, especially for tasks
demanding precision, this inherent flaw actually opens up vast
possibilities for innovative product design. Rather than expecting
deterministic answers, we should explore using AI to enhance or create
products that thrive on probabilistic outputs, focusing on
user-friendly design and domain-specific tools. 

 RULE OF 50 WEIGHTED 2X FOR GROWTH (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 In the evolving startup landscape, the old "Rule of 40" (growth +
profitability = 40+) has been recalibrated to emphasize growth's
higher value. Dubbed the "Rule of 50," it considers growth twice as
valuable as profit, urging founders to aim higher for sustainable
success. Prioritize growth but don't neglect profitability for a
balanced, scalable approach.
