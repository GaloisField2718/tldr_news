HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE ENGINEERINGIFICATION OF EVERYTHING (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The engineering mindset and tools are infiltrating non-engineering
roles, creating a feedback loop that redefines professions, such as
"design engineering." This shift is fueled by LLMs, increased capital
investment in B2B SaaS for non-engineers, and evolving professional
identities. The success of this trend makes roles more autonomous and
flexible, urging everyone to adopt a builder's mindset to stay
competitive. 

 IS SAAS DEAD? NO. BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR: IT'S UNSTABLE (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A $500M ARR company worth only $1B. That's PagerDuty right now - 2x
revenue. The median public SaaS company trades at 3x. Workday's CEO
changed the company narrative three quarters in a row. The argument
here is that Claude 3.5 Sonnet shipping in June 2024 was the real
inflection point for AI eating software - not ChatGPT. Competitive
advantages that used to last years now last months. SaaS isn't dead,
but revenue durability - the thing every VC priced their multiple on -
might not exist anymore.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO FIND YOUR "ONE METRIC TO RULE THEM ALL" (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The founder of HotelTonight tracked 80 metrics at his first two
startups. Both failed. At HotelTonight, he picked one - total
transactions - and it worked. Slack found that teams sending 2,000+
messages had 93% retention. Airbnb zeroed in on nights booked.
WhatsApp only tracked MAU. 

 SO YOU WANT TO HIRE A FORWARD DEPLOYED ENGINEER: HOW TO KNOW IF YOU
NEED ONE AND HOW TO GET THE ROLE RIGHT (32 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) embed directly with customers to
build the 'last mile' of the product to work in production. Unlike
traditional solutions consultants or sales engineers, FDEs are still
very much engineers who write and debug production code. Founders are
turning to the FDE model to roll out highly technical AI products to
remove the blockers that stand in the way of adoption. This post looks
at what makes this role successful. FDEs can be powerful when deployed
intentionally, but they're not the answer for every company or
customer, and it takes a ton of careful design to get a return on
investment in the role. 

 WHO OWNS PRICING? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most SaaS companies have pricing spread across 3-4 different systems.
Entitlements are hardcoded. Product catalogs live in multiple places.
Launching a new tier takes six months. This piece lays out four
pillars to fix it: unified catalog, decoupled entitlements, real-time
metering, and a GTM control plane. Whether or not you buy the full
framework, the diagnosis is right. If changing a price at your company
takes an engineering sprint, something is very wrong.

 HOW AI-ENABLED STARTUPS ARE MOVING FASTER — AND REWRITING THE VC
PLAYBOOK (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI is reshaping the relationship between founders and venture
capital. A new kind of startup is emerging between the big headlines:
the Silicon Valley small business. These companies are tiny, extremely
leveraged, and shockingly productive. AI is being used as a force
multiplier to ship faster, iterate more aggressively, and hit
meaningful revenue in months rather than years. The result is a quiet
but profound pressure on the traditional VC model. Expectations are
being warped by a small group of AI-native outliers that don't need
the level of capital the industry was built around. 

 PATTERNS ARE THE END OF PRODUCT ANALYTICS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI agents and conversational interfaces are evolving customer
interactions beyond traditional product analytics, which focused on
linear sequences of clicks. Instead of static metrics, businesses need
to analyze patterns of behavior across various channels to accurately
capture dynamic consumer journeys. Pattern-based analytics can reveal
evolving customer intent and improve the overall experience by
highlighting efficient paths and potential friction points. 

 WHY AI MOATS STILL MATTER (AND HOW THEY'VE CHANGED) (52 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 AI is an incredible tool for differentiation. However, the AI-ness of
capability is not a source of defensibility. The defensibility of
software resides in owning the end-to-end workflow, in the context in
which it's applied, becoming the system of record, having a network
effect, and being deeply embedded within customers. The market
opportunity for software today is largely labor.

 AI systems can encode prioritization and quality standards to apply
product judgment consistently across software development. 

 ANDY RACHLEFF ON WHAT MOST FOUNDERS GET WRONG ABOUT PRODUCT/MARKET
FIT (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Founders often err by focusing on altering the "what" in their value
hypothesis, rather than recognizing a technological inflection point
for product development. 

 TWO POSITIONS THAT STILL CREATE DURABLE AI MOATS (5 MINUTE READ) [18]


 Durable defensibility comes from owning the “mint position,”
where data is created at the moment work happens, not just read from a
system of record. 

 CONCENTRATION IN VC (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 3% of deployed capital delivered all returns across 1,200+
investments and 350+ exits.
