Carta Launch is free [4] - up to 25 stakeholders and $1M raised.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 BUILD WHAT'S FUNDABLE (30 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Technology is a tool. So is venture capital. We must not become a
tool of our tools. Anchor yourself in beliefs. Otherwise, you'll
assimilate and lose your individuality. 

 ONLY THREE KINDS OF AI PRODUCTS ACTUALLY WORK (17 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There are three successful types of large language model products:
chatbots, coding completion products, and agentic products.
Summarization, translation, and transcription are more features of a
chatbot product than products in their own right. LLM-generated feeds
and video games based on AI-generated content don't work yet, but may
soon. LLMs have a lot of potential, but most people are building
copies of the same thing.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO SCALE DISTRIBUTED PRODUCT TEAMS FROM 10 TO 100+ IN 2025 (11
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scaling a distributed product team can be very challenging. What gets
you from 0 to 10 people won't get you to 50. Getting to 150 requires
deliberately breaking working patterns and replacing them with new
ones. Companies that successfully scale plan for their next stage
while still in their current one. Scaling is about multiplication, not
addition - create systems that enable others to do more. 

 EARNOUT BASICS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Earnouts look simple but hinge on details most founders don't control
after the sale.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MODELBUSTERS ARE RESHAPING TECH (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Modelbusters are companies that take advantage of a platform shift
and the new business models that the shift makes possible. The TAM for
these companies is much bigger than all the consensus estimates and
financial models in the world can predict. When they catch momentum,
they grow much faster than anyone would expect. A new generation of
modelbusters is forming thanks to AI.
