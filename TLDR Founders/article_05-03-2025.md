HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHERE ARE THE 2021 UNICORNS TODAY? 60% ARE STUCK IN LIMBO, PER CARTA
(3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A blunt reality check: many startups that soared to $1B valuations in
2021 haven't raised another round, sold, or shut down. They remain
“unicorns” in name only—without big follow-on funding or
traction. Some were acquired or got new investments, but most are
stuck. This reminds today's founders that easy money doesn't last, and
that real growth and solid business results matter more than inflated
headlines. 

 THE END STATE OF THE “END OF SOFTWARE” (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Everyone now carries a camera that could rival what Spielberg once
dreamed of, yet we're not all blockbuster filmmakers. In the same way,
upcoming AI tools will let people build software with minimal effort,
but that doesn't mean everyone suddenly becomes a pro engineer. What
it does mean is a flood of smaller, personalized “apps”—like
social media content today—created by users who once relied on
one-size-fits-all solutions. 

 COREWEAVE TO ACQUIRE WEIGHTS & BIASES (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CoreWeave has announced plans to acquire Weights & Biases for $1.7B.
The integration aims to accelerate AI innovation by combining
CoreWeave's cloud infrastructure with Weights & Biases' AI tools for
model training and evaluation. The acquisition is expected to close in
the first half of 2025, pending regulatory approval.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE 9 LAWS OF GTM SUCCESS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 For founders struggling to get sales, marketing, and customer success
on the same page, these nine rules show how to pull every team into a
shared plan. It starts with the CEO claiming all of go-to-market,
setting a single GTM dashboard, and avoiding siloed goals. Instead of
chasing “marketing = leads, sales = deals,” the focus stays on the
entire business outcome. The result: a more unified path to real
growth and less confusion among teams. 

 SEED-STRAPPING: THE NEW PLAYBOOK FOR BUILDING PROFITABLE AI COMPANIES
(5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 If you've seen giant AI funding deals but want a more direct road to
profit, check out “seed-strapping.” Rising founders are raising
only a small seed, making quick revenue by solving a clear niche
problem, and pouring that money back into the business—often
reaching serious ARR before needing a big round. Lower AI costs and
easy-to-integrate APIs allow small teams to scale fast without burning
through millions up front. 

 WHY THE BEST LEADERS ARE PARANOID ABOUT BASIC EXECUTION (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Even the smartest strategies can fail if basic tasks slip through the
cracks. It's easy to forget a follow-up or ignore a customer question
in the rush of daily work. However, small misses add up fast, eroding
trust. Top operators build systems so that routine items—like
callbacks, contract renewals, and support tickets—never get lost.
It's not glamorous, but it's how consistent leaders win in the long
run.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CONTEXT, POSSIBILITY, INTENT, AND ACTION (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Ever feel overwhelmed by shifting goals, daily chaos, and a flood of
new ideas? This piece lays out four pillars—context, possibility,
intent, and action—to help you design weekly or monthly rituals that
keep everyone on track. By mixing in short review cycles, you link big
dreams (“possibility”) with the real limits you face
(“context”), forming consistent processes that boost momentum for
your startup. 

 WILL AI AGENTS REPLACE SAAS? (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI agents might complement but won't fully replace SaaS platforms, as
they still require a robust infrastructure for data and functionality.
While AI agents offer automation and insights, they'll need human
oversight for nuanced decision-making and innovation. The future
likely involves a hybrid model that enhances SaaS through AI
capabilities while addressing challenges related to integration,
trust, and accountability. 

 “I SCRATCHED MY OWN ITCH” ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Fixing a problem you personally have doesn't guarantee a winning
startup. Just because you felt the pain doesn't mean there's a big,
urgent market. The real test is making sure many customers share that
pain, will pay for the solution, and see it as a must-have. Many
founders miss this reality check and stay stuck in a personal bubble.
Focus on broader proof, honest pricing tests, and user feedback beyond
your own story.
