HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WE'RE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF UNICORN PRODUCTION IN 3+ YEARS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 October 2025 saw the highest number of unicorns created in over three
years, with 20 companies adding $44.5 billion in value. The funding
environment shows signs of normalizing, particularly for B2B SaaS
companies with strong metrics, while AI-native startups receive
disproportionate attention from VCs. Although the bar for becoming a
unicorn is high, those that succeed can achieve substantial
valuations. 

 PRESENTATIONS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Benedict Evans has given presentations for many companies in the last
few years, including Alphabet, Amazon, Hitachi, L'Oréal, LVMH,
Nasdaq, and Vodafone. Twice a year, he produces a big presentation on
the macro and strategic trends of the tech industry. This post
contains the slides for November's presentation, 'AI eats the world'.
It also contains videos for two other recent presentations.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FOUNDER ENERGY (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Some founders channel a sense of momentum, energy, and intensity in
all of their interactions. This can be a learned skill. Channeling
great energy as a founder is key because it helps with recruiting
talent and fundraising. The vibes matter a lot to employees taking a
pay cut and to investors who are betting primarily on the founders. 

 THE SIMPLE SECRET TO INFLUENCE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Effective leaders elevate others by fostering environments where
people feel empowered and valued. Techniques like asking open-ended
questions and giving clear context promote engagement and confidence.
Leaders gain influence by focusing on empowering others rather than
showcasing their own brilliance.

 SO WHAT IF IT'S A BUBBLE? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Bubble dynamics don't matter to most founders because we all live in
today's market and not in the future. Founders who have the ability to
take advantage of the market should do so as long as it benefits their
companies. If money is plentiful, you should probably take it - if the
bubble bursts, the money will probably be useful. Great founders live
in the kind of long term that radically reduces the impact of
individual bubbles.

CONFLICT AND HOW TO FIX IT (46 MINUTE READ) [15]
