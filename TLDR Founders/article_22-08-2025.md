HEADLINES & TRENDS

 CHARACTER.AI EXPLORES SALE OR NEW FUNDING AMID RISING COSTS (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Character.AI has been holding discussions with potential buyers,
banks, and staff over the past few weeks about raising a few hundred
million dollars at a valuation of more than $1 billion. The startup's
founders left the company last September to join Google, leaving
employees to take over ownership. If sold, the buyer would get
Character.AI's app and website, which hosts chatbots that resemble
anime characters, celebrities, and historical figures. Character.AI
makes most of its revenue by charging for premium features with its
chatbots. It expects to reach $50 million in annualized revenue by the
end of the year. 

 AN OBLIGATION TO INDEPENDENCE (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 If you own an independent company and you're not greenlighting weird
stuff, you're wasting one of life's true pleasures. Independence isn't
just about freedom - it's an obligation to try things no board would
ever approve. Public companies worth billions can't do what you can
do. They need to justify every move, run it past committees, and worry
about quarterly earnings. You can fund the oddball ideas, the "this
will probably never work but..." experiments that occasionally catch
fire. Very few people get to provide cover for strange attempts
without asking permission. So if you're in that position and playing
it safe, you're missing the entire point of being independent.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ADDING PAYMENTS TO YOUR SAAS PRODUCT: A TACTICAL PLAYBOOK (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Payments is the holy grail for SaaS companies - your model says
you'll make 2% of millions in transaction volume, and suddenly every
board meeting becomes about when you're launching it. This playbook
shows why most companies shouldn't even try. You need actual money
changing hands in your customers' workflows, which sounds obvious
until you realize how many analytics platforms are trying to wedge
payments into their product. The winners are boring - software for
dentists processing copays, auto mechanics sending invoices, and
nonprofits taking donations. This guide covers the math on what you'll
actually make, realistic adoption rates, and how to expand from basic
payment processing into the lucrative stuff like lending. 

 HOW TO BUILD AN AI COMPANY IN A NEW MARKET (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most AI startups just automate existing workflows in finance or
healthcare. Delphi is doing something weirder - building digital
versions of people's minds that others can talk to. The founder fed
his grandfather's memoir into an AI so he could still ask him for
business advice. Now thousands of coaches, consultants, and professors
are paying to create their own digital minds. 

 RESPECTFUL PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Performance management is the thing everyone whispers about but
nobody wants to discuss openly. This manager shares the approach she
uses when someone's not meeting expectations. The decision is less
about whether someone is "good" or "bad," but rather whether their
strengths match what the role needs right now. She gives people two
projects over four weeks to demonstrate their skills - one tactical,
one strategic - and checks in weekly. Sometimes people just need
clearer feedback and turn out to be excellent. If, after giving
someone a real chance, it's clear they can't do the job, keeping them
in that role isn't kindness. They know they're failing, the team's
frustrated, and everyone's performance drops.

 CONVOKE RAISES SEED FOR AI BIOPHARMA TOOL (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Convoke raised $8.6 million in seed funding for an AI tool aimed at
reducing drug development timelines and costs. This highlights the
increasing interest in AI solutions within the pharma industry. 

 NO, AI PROGRESS IS NOT GRINDING TO A HALT (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Everyone's declaring GPT-5 a disappointment that proves AI progress
is hitting a wall, but they're measuring it wrong. When GPT-4 launched
in 2023, it was compared to technology from 2020 - of course, it
looked revolutionary. Now GPT-5 is being compared to models released
last month. If GPT-4 came out today, it would be dead on arrival. It
handled 8,200 tokens versus GPT-5's 400,000, cost 10x more to run, and
scored 25/100 on benchmarks where GPT-5 gets 69. On real-world coding
tests, GPT-4 solved 2.8% of problems while GPT-5 solved 65%. GPT-4 can
handle 5-minute human tasks - GPT-5 can handle tasks that are more
than two hours. However, because everyone expected another ChatGPT
moment and OpenAI bungled the release, the narrative has solidified in
DC that AI is stalling. 

 YOU WILL NEVER HAVE ENOUGH (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Constraints in business, like limited time, team size, or budget,
force creativity and focus. These limitations should be seen as
opportunities to innovate and gain competitive advantages. Embracing
constraints can lead to significant achievements with efficient
resource use.

 PRODUCT FIDELITY (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This founder noticed his apps still take 2-3 months to build, same as
before AI tools - the initial build is faster, but the "missing
details" eat up all the saved time.
