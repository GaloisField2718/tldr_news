HEADLINES & TRENDS

 10 CHARTS THAT CAPTURE HOW THE WORLD IS CHANGING (11 MINUTE READ) [5]


 This article presents ten charts that illustrate major global shifts,
covering topics like AI adoption, healthcare employment, and venture
capital secondary markets. AI is still in early stages, with 84% of
people yet to use AI products, while healthcare is creating
significant job growth. Moreover, secondaries are emerging as a vital
liquidity option in venture capital, and Retatrutide shows promise as
a groundbreaking drug in peptide therapeutics. 

 JUMP BALL (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Forty million people organized around the Citrini AI report in a
week. It didn't matter that the DoorDash analysis was structurally
incoherent or that marketplace founders were losing their minds over
it. What mattered was that it made people move. We're in an era of
simultaneous epistemic jump balls where the normal mechanisms for
establishing truth - DCF models, expert consensus, and institutional
trust - have broken down across every domain at once. In the absence
of those referees, whoever tells the most compelling story wins. For
founders, the implication is uncomfortable. Your narrative might
matter more than your numbers right now.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NON-CODE MOATS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 We are almost at the point where startups or existing competitors can
agent-scrape their way through a production application and clone all
of the accessible parts with ease. This will destroy development speed
as a fundamental advantage. There are still moats that can defend
products and deliver ongoing value, including scale and market
dominance, algorithms and datasets, trust and community, and
familiarity. Product strategy has always been about more than just
shipping fast. The moats are in what businesses know, who trusts them,
and business models that are genuinely hard to clone. 

 $20K TO $700K ARR IN 6 WEEKS INSIDE YC (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lyra went from $20K to $700K ARR in six weeks inside YC. Every other
founder in the batch automated their outbound. This founder did the
exact opposite - manual, high-touch, doing things most founders would
never consider. The Stripe chart speaks for itself. Sometimes the
counterintuitive move is the only move that works at the earliest
stages when you're still figuring out what resonates.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE HEAT-DEATH OF SAAS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI-native companies will be good at building agents and augmented
experiences, while incumbents will not. Every company is trying to
list itself as AI-native or agentic, but few will make the transition
to being a market leader in the AI era. The companies that will win in
the next era need to serve as an Agent Substrate, which means more
than just slapping a chatbot onto a legacy interface. Legacy SaaS
companies will not go to zero, but they will gradually become
irrelevant. 

 FOUNDERS WHO CAN'T TELL THEIR STORY CAN'T SCALE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 When your head of sales tells a different story than your head of
product, that's not a positioning problem. It's a strategy problem
showing up as misaligned roadmaps, confused customers, and teams
pulling in different directions. Struggling to articulate your story
reveals something deeper than communication issues. It reveals an
unclear strategy. The founders who scale effectively become the chief
storytellers for their company. Try recording yourself explaining what
you do to someone outside your industry. If it takes more than two
minutes, you've got work to do.

 THE PAINFUL GAP IN PLAYBOOKS BETWEEN AI-NATIVE AND TRADITIONAL B2B
STARTUPS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The urgency gap forces incumbents to adapt or lose share to leaner
competitors that treat AI as foundational, not incremental. 

 LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT VC "VALUE-ADD" (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 If your founders need your technical support or product direction,
you probably backed a weak team.

[17] 

 Leveraged agents make users more productive, while function agents do
the job.
