 THE TOP 4 AI USE CASES SAAS COMPANIES ARE BUILDING WITH INTEGRATIONS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 A chat feature isn't enough - the best AI companies are building AI
copilots, agents, and workflows (often all of the above) into their
products.

But these types of features share a common thread - data &
interoperability.

Agents need external context via RAG [4] and to take action in
3rd-party apps.

Workflow and agent builders need to have integration steps to
orchestrate automations.

See how companies like Intercom, Copy.ai, and You.com [4] use
integrations to power their different AI products.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE MANUFACTURING OPPORTUNITY (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Everyone's talking about reshoring manufacturing, but most don't
grasp what it really means. China produces 44.7 million tons of
aluminum while the US makes just 1.3 million - what will we build
robot frames with? China controls 90% of the rare earth metals needed
for electric motors. Even defense companies can't build without
Chinese components. The real opportunity isn't making socks here, but
investing in the "primes" - vertical integrators in robotics, energy,
defense, and computing who can disrupt incumbents. 

 THE FUTURE OF FINANCE IS MODULAR (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Finance teams used to face a brutal choice: all-in-one suites with
four mediocre features or cobbled-together niche tools. Now,
best-of-breed partnerships are creating a "choose your own adventure"
landscape. Brex cards show up in Zip's procurement flow. Navan handles
travel for Brex customers. Finance software makers who focus on doing
one thing exceptionally well and then partner with others are winning
the enterprise market over bloated all-in-one platforms. 

 TECH ACQUISITIONS ARE BACK ON (WITH AN ASTERISK) (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Recent tech acquisitions, particularly in AI, indicate a possible end
to the M&A slump. OpenAI is actively pursuing deals, notably a rumored
$3 billion acquisition of coding app Windsurf. Databricks has
continued its aggressive acquisition strategy, highlighted by its
recent $1 billion purchase of Neon.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY AGENTS BREAK PLG (AND HOW TO REBUILD IT) (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI agents are killing product-led growth by changing how users
interact with software. Instead of clicking around interfaces and
discovering features, users now delegate tasks to AI agents. This
breaks classic PLG tactics: onboarding flows become irrelevant, UI
optimization loses impact, and "aha moments" disappear when users
aren't directly using the product. Companies must rebuild their growth
strategies around capturing user intent, measuring outcomes, and
building trust in delegation. 

 HOW TO MEASURE TOPICAL AUTHORITY [IN 2025] (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While AI snippets and agents reshape search, one SEO principle
remains crucial: topical authority. Google still rewards sites that
comprehensively cover related subtopics - leaked documents confirm it.
The best way to measure it is to calculate your "Topic Share" - the
percentage of traffic you capture from all keywords in a topic
compared to competitors. 

 LESS PRODUCT, NOT MORE (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Adding more features won't fix underlying product issues like slow
growth or low engagement. Instead, tech teams should focus on
understanding customer needs, validating the problem, and ensuring
their solution is the best option. Resist the urge to build without
first addressing core issues and assumptions.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 SUPERWALL (TOOL) [11] 

 Quickly build & test paywalls without shipping updates. 

 GITHUB CHAT (TOOL) [12] 

 GitHub Chat API lets developers chat with and explore any public
GitHub repository programmatically. 

 HEROUI CHAT (TOOL) [13] 

 HeroUI Chat generates beautiful, production-ready React apps from
prompts or screenshots using AI.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE FIRST 40 MONTHS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Don't just sprint from round to round - map out your first 40 months
of fundraising. Today's funding climate is very unpredictable, with
many investors chasing momentum over milestones. What's hot changes
constantly (neurotech: dead in 2022, hot in 2025). The best founders
understand this and build longer roadmaps that account for future
financing markets, not just immediate goals. 

 THE AMBIGUITY EFFECT (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 When you play it safe and order the same dinner every time - even
when exotic options sound better - that's the Ambiguity Effect at
work. We avoid choices with unknown odds, sometimes paying to dodge
uncertainty. In one study, people gave up 72% of potential payout just
to avoid ambiguity. 

 INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE AGE OF AI GATEKEEPERS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Databricks' acquisition of Neon revealed that 80% of new databases on
Neon were created by AI agents, not people. AI app builders default to
certain tools, such as Neon for databases and Stripe for payments,
establishing these as industry standards. Dev-tool companies must
optimize for AI agent visibility and offer seamless, zero-click
integrations to become the default choice in AI-driven environments.

 THE SYNTHESIS TRAP (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 When content merely synthesizes existing ideas, AI can now replace
it. 

 SCALABLE GROWTH (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Don't force new growth channels when your users already show you what
works. 

 MATH TO EVALUATE SALES REPS & GTM (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 High-performing sales reps aren't expensive - bad ones are.
