HEADLINES & TRENDS

 A YEAR LATER, WHAT THREADS COULD LEARN FROM OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Meta's social network, Threads, has reached 175 million monthly
active users in its first year. While making progress in integrating
with the diverse and providing an API for developers, shipping
features at a rapid pace and gathering user feedback, Threads still
has room for improvement in areas such as topic discovery, third-party
app support, independence from Instagram, news and politics, its "For
You" algorithm, and ability to surface local content. 

 VERTICAL SOFTWARE, RICHES IN NICHES (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Vertical software companies focused on specific industries can be
extremely capital-efficient and profitable, with durable long-term
growth potential. While their total addressable market may initially
seem limited, great management teams find ways to expand their
opportunities over time. Valuation multiples for vertical software
leaders can appear high but are often justified by their strong
execution and ability to grow revenue and profits consistently. 

 DOES AI CHANGE HOW MUCH MY DATA IS WORTH? (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The value of individual personal data has traditionally been viewed
as insignificant, with only aggregated data being commercially
valuable. However, with the emergence of a new market for consumer
data to train large language models, the value of personal datasets
may be increasing, though individuals are unlikely to be directly
compensated by platforms in the near future. Instead, data collectives
and cooperative models that allow individuals to own a stake in the
economic benefits of their contributed data are emerging as potential
ways for people to participate in this new data economy.

 A GUIDE TO BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE TECHNICAL TEAM (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A technical team is a group of developers focused on tasks that do
not directly involve business operations. These teams can be
structured around specific tasks or be more general, requiring a
customer, such as a CTO, to provide direction and a long-term backlog
of tasks. Building an effective technical team involves recruiting the
right people, establishing a workflow, and evaluating their
performance, which can be challenging due to the complexity and
ambiguity of technical tasks.

 THE MAGIC OF SMALL ENGINEERING TEAMS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 One effective approach to maintaining the speed and innovation of a
startup as it scales is to organize into small, autonomous teams that
can own specific areas of the product or company. These teams should
be small, run themselves, have one leader, and have a goal that aligns
with the company's overall mission. This structure minimizes
centralized processes and management layers, allowing for faster
decision-making and execution.

and aspects of life. As AI continues to advance, it is essential to
