HEADLINES & TRENDS

 STARTUPS TAKE LONGER TO CLOSE ROUNDS AS FUNDING CLIFF LOOMS (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Startups are taking longer than ever to secure Series B funding after
their initial Series A round, with the median time gap reaching a
record high of 28 months in 2024. While some companies in hot sectors
like AI have managed to raise funds in quick succession, others have
taken over five years to close their Series B, and many startups that
raised money during the 2020-2021 boom years have yet to secure
additional funding. 

 OVERBUILDING IN AI: A MODERN TWIST ON AN OLD TALE (7 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are pouring
massive amounts of capital into AI infrastructure, with over $50
billion per quarter in aggregate capex expected by Q4 this year,
despite the risk of overbuilding. While this echoes past investment
booms like canals, railways, and telecom, today's AI boom is driven by
stronger demand signals, more flexible infrastructure, and a
concentration of investment among a few major players. However,
overbuilding still carries significant risks, and the key question is
whether AI demand will keep pace with the rapid expansion. 

 2024 GTM BENCHMARKS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Software revenue growth continues to slow in 2024, especially for
startups, as budgets tighten and buyers favor larger, established
vendors to reduce risk and consolidate tools. Net revenue retention
(NRR) has been falling since 2021, making it harder for companies to
grow quickly. Despite the challenges, contract term lengths are
increasing as companies commit to multi-year deals with trusted
vendors, and the customer acquisition cost (CAC) ratio has risen
significantly since 2021, partly due to lower sales rep quota
attainment.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO TERM SHEETS FOR STARTUP FOUNDERS (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A term sheet is a crucial non-binding document that outlines the key
terms and conditions of a potential investment in a startup.
Understanding the components of a term sheet, such as investment
amount, valuation, liquidation preference, and voting rights, is
essential for founders to negotiate effectively and secure the best
possible deal for their company. Armed with this knowledge, founders
can approach term sheet negotiations with confidence and make informed
decisions that align with their startup's long-term growth trajectory.


 6 REASONS REVOPS IS THE MVP OF GTM (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Revenue Operations (RevOps) has become a critical function for
successful SaaS companies, evolving from a data-focused role to a
strategic, advisory position that drives revenue growth. RevOps
leaders, now sourced from diverse backgrounds, leverage technological
advancements, optimize tech stacks, create unified dashboards, and
prioritize initiatives to help companies achieve their targets in
today's competitive landscape. 

 FOUNDER RECRUITING INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Developing a strong team is crucial for a company's success, but many
founders struggle to translate their intentions into effective action.
The Founder Recruiting Intelligence Quotient (FRIQ) framework helps
founders assess and improve their team-building skills by focusing on
four key areas: adopting a growth mindset, demonstrating recruiting
hustle, knowing what great talent looks like, and building a scalable
recruiting machine.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHERE SHOULD CUSTOMER SUCCESS SIT ON THE P&L? (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Customer Success and Customer Support are often confused, but they
serve different purposes within a company. Customer Success focuses on
ensuring customers get full value from the product to drive retention
and expansion, while Customer Support handles break/fix requests. When
determining whether Customer Success belongs in Cost of Goods Sold
(COGS) or Sales and Marketing (S&M), consider factors such as the need
for assistance in product activation, training, filling product gaps,
and whether the team has a quota for expansion or renewal dollars. 

 SOFTWARE ESTIMATES HAVE NEVER WORKED AND NEVER WILL (2 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Estimating software development timelines has consistently proven
ineffective, as the inherently novel nature of most projects makes
precise predictions impossible. Instead of relying on traditional
estimates, adopting flexible approaches like using budgets or
"appetites" allows developers to negotiate scope during development,
leading to better outcomes and timely delivery. This method aligns
with human creativity and has been successfully implemented by teams
to produce high-quality software. 

 A NUMBER FROM TODAY AND A STORY ABOUT TOMORROW (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Forecasting involves combining current data with narratives about the
future, which can lead to subjective interpretations. While the data
provides a factual basis, the accompanying story reflects personal
beliefs and assumptions, making predictions inherently uncertain.
Understanding the narratives people construct around data is crucial
for accurate forecasting, as they significantly influence the
perceived trajectory of trends and events.
