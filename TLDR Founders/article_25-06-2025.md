HEADLINES & TRENDS

 META'S AI STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta spent $14.3B on Scale AI and considered acquiring SSI for $32B
after Llama 4 underperformed expectations, ranking 39th on benchmarks,
while offering 9-figure packages to poach AI researchers. Zuck's
strategy stems from Apple's platform control costing Meta billions in
potential profits, driving his "do anything necessary" mentality to
own the next platform through a personal AI assistant that knows your
entire life context. 

 HOW STABLECOINS COULD FAIL (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Bank for International Settlements warns that stablecoins fail
the "singleness" test of money—different stablecoins could trade at
varying rates based on issuer creditworthiness, creating fragmented
quasi-dollars rather than unified currency. This risks "stablecoin
corporate feudalism," where users get trapped in specific ecosystems
with fees for moving between tokens. 

 WARP'S NEW AGENTIC DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT HELPS DEVELOPERS WORK WITH
AI CODING AGENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Warp launched an agentic development environment to streamline
AI-assisted coding by incorporating AI-powered prompts and supervision
controls. This system allows developers to manage and guide AI agents
efficiently, leveraging terminal-style panes. Warp aims to outpace
competitors by integrating coding and terminal tools into a unified,
AI-centric platform.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MICRO-MOMENT ANALYSIS IN PRODUCT ADOPTION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Micro-moments are split-second decisions when users reach for devices
to solve immediate problems. AI can now predict these high-intent
interactions for product adoption. AI-powered personalization achieves
341% higher conversion rates by delivering contextually relevant
experiences during four key moment types ("I-want-to-know/go/do/buy")
that capture users right when they're ready to act. 

 AIRPLANE GO-TO-MARKET (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 PLG companies inevitably need sales teams as they move upmarket, just
as sales-led companies add self-serve to lower CAC, creating a hybrid
"two-motor" approach. Success isn't choosing between product-led or
sales-led growth, but knowing when to activate each motor: self-serve
for initial adoption and small accounts and sales for enterprise deals
with complex requirements. 

 VALUATION IS A TERRIBLE SCORECARD (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Valuation is a misleading metric for startup success, often obscuring
financial realities like dilution and execution risks. Instead of
focusing on valuation, startups should prioritize efficiency,
retention, progress toward breakeven, and realistic assessments of
equity payouts. High valuations may create pressure to justify
numbers, shifting focus from building a sustainable business.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 👨‍💻 YOU DIDN'T START YOUR COMPANY TO BE THE IT PERSON
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Electric AI helps you cut IT costs up to 70% and improve security 3x
— all from one simple platform. Manage employee onboarding, devices,
and threats with ease. Take a demo [11] and get a free YETI cooler or
Apple AirPods Pr [11]o. 

 AIRTABLE AI (TOOL) [12] 

 Newly designed Airtable with AI and agents at the core. 

 JANUS (TOOL) [13] 

 Janus battle-tests AI agents with thousands of simulations to catch
hallucinations, rule breaks, and failures. It surfaces risky outputs
and delivers clear, actionable improvement insights. 

 LONG (TOOL) [14] 

 Long is a permissionless platform with fair pricing and anti-hype
protections that lets anyone invest in startups early.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE WAITLIST DELUSION (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Waitlists should only exist when you have genuine supply constraints
(hard product limits, quality issues, or service capacity), not for
hype or brand building. Data shows waitlisted signups convert at 3x
worse rates than immediate access, with performance decaying sharply
over time, making extended waitlists a growth killer disguised as a
growth tactic. 

 CAPITAL INTENSITY ISN'T BAD (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Hard tech startups using asset-backed financing achieve lower
dilution than software companies burning equity on customer
acquisition. Crusoe Energy proved this by raising just $1.59B in
equity to build massive data centers by securitizing generators and
GPUs separately. Mastering structured finance turns capital intensity
into a competitive advantage since physical assets create deeper moats
than expensive customer acquisition in crowded software markets. 

 WHEN AI HAS BETTER TASTE THAN YOU (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI is conquering not just our capabilities (skills) but potentially
our taste (preferences), leaving only human agency—our will to act
on our values—as our unique advantage. While AI can learn to predict
and replicate even "great taste" through pattern recognition, only
humans possess the subjective drive to determine what problems matter
and what's worth pursuing.

 AI MAKES BAD MANAGERS (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Relying on AI for performance assessments prevents managers from
