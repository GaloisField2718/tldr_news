 EVERYTHING OPENAI ANNOUNCED AT DEVDAY 2025 (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is transforming ChatGPT from a chatbot into an operating
system. The company launched Apps SDK so developers can build actual
apps inside ChatGPT instead of just GPTs, meaning you can talk
directly to Canva, Zillow, and Coursera without leaving the chat
interface. OpenAI also released AgentKit for building agentic
workflows with evaluation tools included. 

 NYSE OWNER ICE COMMITS UP TO $2B INVESTMENT IN BETTING PLATFORM
POLYMARKET (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The NYSE owner, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), plans to invest up
to $2 billion in the prediction marketplace Polymarket, valuing it at
around $8 billion. This move seeks to provide legitimacy and expand
Polymarket's reach, potentially aiding its return to the US market.
ICE will also distribute Polymarket's event-driven data and
collaborate on tokenization projects. 

 AMD STOCK SKYROCKETS 23% AS OPENAI LOOKS TO TAKE STAKE IN AI
CHIPMAKER (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs over multiple
years, starting with 1 gigawatt in late 2026. If the deal is fully
exercised, OpenAI would acquire 10% of AMD. Two weeks ago, OpenAI
agreed to a deal with Nvidia for $100 billion, with OpenAI's data
center spending commitments now totalling over roughly $1 trillion
over the coming years.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 7 QUESTIONS EVERY DATA TEAM SHOULD ASK THE BUSINESS (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Most data teams struggle with the same problem: nobody knows what to
work on. The business asks for dashboards, the analysts build them,
and a month later, everyone quietly stops using them. This piece
argues it's a conversation problem. The author's team at Facebook used
to sit down with every department twice a year and ask questions that
got to the real issues: What's keeping you from hitting your targets?
When was the last time data changed your mind? Where are you putting
in effort without results? These questions don't sound technical, but
they surface where data can actually help. If you stop asking what
people “need from data” and start asking how they make decisions,
you'll finally find work that matters. 

 ELAD GIL'S FRAMEWORK FOR SPOTTING BILLION-DOLLAR MARKETS BEFORE THEY
LOOK BIG (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Markets beat teams beat ideas - great teams can't escape bad markets,
but great markets give you multiple shots on goal. Wedding invitations
seemed too niche, payroll too boring, file storage too late, then
became Minted, Gusto, and Dropbox. Four principles for finding
overlooked opportunities: use first principles to ask what's changed
in cost or infrastructure, scratch your own itch with real pain, not
vague ideas, build product-first because "would you use this" is weak
but "would you pay now" is real, and look where smart people tinker
for fun before mainstream notices.

 CAN AI WRITE BETTER? (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A founder decided to measure what makes great writing tick,
literally. By mapping the rhythm and “surprise spikes” in authors
like Hemingway and Wodehouse, he found each has a quantifiable
fingerprint: where sentences get weird, sharp, or musical. He trained
a small model to detect those pulses, and it worked. Maybe the next
step in AI isn't more scale, but learning how to imitate the texture
of human thought. 

 BUILD A BILLION-DOLLAR STARTUP WITH A MINIMAL TEAM THANKS TO AI (4
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Instagram sold for $1B with 13 people. WhatsApp had 55. PostHog ships
with pods of two to six, and Basecamp runs profitable software with
roughly 30 and no managers. The observable pattern is to design for
systems over headcount. In practice, that means your engineer answers
the support ticket instead of waiting for “customer success,” your
designer pushes copy tweaks straight to production instead of filing a
Jira ticket, and your founder still writes the onboarding emails
because it keeps them close to the user. 

 CHATGPT FOR COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Most people use ChatGPT to ask who their competitors are. This team
turned it into a newsroom analyst. They dropped in homepage links,
headline lists, and keyword data from Toronto outlets and had it break
down tone, coverage gaps, and what kinds of stories each publication
actually wins on. It found patterns humans miss, like which sites
dominate “how/where/when” searches or bury strong topics under
weak headlines. It's the first real glimpse of AI used not for
shortcuts, but for curiosity at scale.
