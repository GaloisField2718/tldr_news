HEADLINES & TRENDS

 56% OF COMPANIES MISSED REVENUE GOALS IN 2023 (4 MINUTE READ) [3] 

 Poor marketing pipeline performance and slower sales velocity in 2023
are predictive of soft revenue growth in 2024 if companies don't make
changes. The majority of companies across SMB, mid-market, and
enterprise segments missed their revenue targets in 2023, with those
that cut GTM funding suffering the most.

 VC MONEY MAKES YOU DUMB (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Common pitfalls VC-backed companies fall into include losing focus on
essential business growth and sustainability due to the pressure of
meeting VC expectations and milestones. It is important to maintain a
balance between using VC funds for growth and retain the creativity
and frugality of a bootstrapped company. Metric tunnel vision can be
dangerous. Focus on real, profitable business practices.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE ARC PRODUCT-MARKET FIT FRAMEWORK (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sequoia presents a framework for understanding product-market fit
(PMF) based on three distinct archetypes: "Hair on Fire" (solving an
urgent, obvious need in a crowded market), "Hard Fact" (solving a
problem customers have accepted as a fact of life), and "Future
Vision" (enabling a new reality through visionary innovation). The
path a company takes depends on how customers relate to the problem
being solved, and each path requires different operating priorities to
succeed, with legendary companies often evolving through multiple
paths as they introduce new products over time.

 DO YOU NEED TO WIN TODAY, OR TOMORROW? (3 MINUTE READ) [12]

opportunities, and available resources when deciding whether to
prioritize winning today or building for tomorrow. Have explicit
