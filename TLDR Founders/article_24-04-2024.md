 WHY BUSY STARTUP FOUNDERS ARE HIRING EXECUTIVE ASSISTANTS (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 An executive assistant isn't a luxury. If you don't have an
assistant, you are the assistant.

Most people buy clothes, cars, or carats. The most successful people
buy time [4]. And there's no greater productivity hack than a trusted
assistant who pushes you to delegate more and more.

Athena's executive assistants [4] let you take back control of your
most valuable asset - your time. If you're a founder who needs to see
results quickly on an affordable budget (including making use of the
latest AI automation [4] superpowers), this is the EA service for you.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WE FOUND PMF: HERE WERE THE SIGNS (5 MINUTE READ) [8]

startups progress through in stages. Using the First Round Capital
framework, this article shares how CommandBar navigated through
different PMF stages. It discusses the challenges and signs associated
with each stage, from having disparate early adopters to experiencing
more consistent demand and usage. The article emphasizes the
importance of focusing on product love and usage, digging deeper into

MISCELLANEOUS

 FROM FOUNDER-LED SALES TO A SALES TEAM (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Transitioning from founder-led sales to a hired sales team is often a
difficult process, but needed when you want to scale. Failure rates
are high with new sales hires, particularly the first ones you make.
This author recommends initially hiring a process-oriented sales
assistant to codify and document the successful sales strategies
developed by the founder, followed by employing a sales leader focused
on building a scalable and repeatable sales process. 

 LLMS AND THE HARRY POTTER PROBLEM (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Long-context LLMs may have large context windows, but they still
struggle with effectively using the information within those contexts,
especially in high-value use cases. This issue can significantly
impact accuracy in high-value use cases like analyzing insurance
policies or legal cases. Opinionated ontologies and knowledge graphs
tailored to specific document categories may be the best current
solution until more generalizable approaches are developed. 

 GOING FROM MANAGER TO LEADER (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 As a founder, you go from managing a company to a small team to a big
team. Each stage requires you to rethink your leadership style. True
leadership is about empowering your employees and inspiring them to
make their own decisions and own the results. A tactic to become a
better leader? Find other founders and managers in your network that
you consider to be excellent leaders, take them for coffee, ask them
questions, and learn from them.
