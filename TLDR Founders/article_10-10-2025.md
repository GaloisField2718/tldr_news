 HOW TO SCALE WITHOUT OVER-HIRING OR BURNING OUT YOUR BEST PEOPLE -
LESSONS FROM LINEAR'S COO (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Cristina Cordova has been in the trenches of some of the MOST ADMIRED
STARTUPS: she was on the early GTM team at STRIPE, built growth at
NOTION, and now helps lead LINEAR ($1.25B valuation) as COO.

In this webinar [4], Cristina will share practical lessons on how to:

 	* Build a COLLAPSIBLE ENGINEERING ORG that flexes with workload
without overextending bandwidth.
 	* Push back (politely + firmly) when investors pressure you to scale
headcount too soon.
 	* Recognize the right signals for when it _is_ time to hire—and
how to design an interview process that prioritizes craftsmanship [4].

Register now [4] to learn how to scale sustainably - without
sacrificing speed.

CHALLENGING DEEPSEEK (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Reflection raised $2 billion at an $8 billion valuation to challenge
established AI labs by developing open-source frontier models. Founded
by ex-Google DeepMind researchers, the startup aims to release a
high-powered language model next year. The company will share model
weights publicly while capitalizing on enterprise and government
clients for revenue. 

 FIGMA PARTNERS WITH GOOGLE TO ADD GEMINI AI TO ITS DESIGN PLATFORM (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Figma has partnered with Google to integrate Gemini AI models into
its design platform, enhancing image editing and generation. Gemini
2.5 Flash promises a 50% reduction in latency for Figma's "Make Image"
feature, improving workflows for 13 million users. Google also
introduced Gemini Enterprise to enhance AI capabilities for enterprise
clients, expanding its suite of integrations and partnerships. 

 EVEN AFTER STARGATE, ORACLE, NVIDIA, AND AMD, OPENAI HAS MORE BIG
DEALS COMING SOON, SAM ALTMAN SAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is involved in major deals with AMD and Nvidia, acquiring
significant stakes in these companies, while planning to develop
next-gen AI GPUs and data centers. CEO Sam Altman indicates more
partnerships are imminent as OpenAI aims to ramp up infrastructure to
meet future demand. Despite current revenue not matching extensive
investment, Altman remains confident that these strategic moves will
drive future economic returns.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WE REBUILT OUR ONBOARDING AROUND MCP (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most developer onboarding flows lose users before they ever see real
value. DevCycle found the problem wasn't motivation, it was location.
Developers don't want to leave their editors to try a demo app. So the
team rebuilt onboarding around the Model-Context-Protocol (MCP),
letting AI coding assistants like Cursor or VS Code install and
configure the SDK directly in-editor. Two prompts now replace an
entire tutorial, tripling install rates and shrinking time-to-value
from hours to minutes. 

 HOW TO BUILD (AND EXPLAIN) COHORT CHARTS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most founders can quote retention rates, but few can show them. This
guide breaks down the three cohort charts every operator should know -
range retention tables, spider charts, and stacked area charts - and
explains when to use each. You'll learn how to build them, interpret
the patterns, and turn a pile of numbers into a story about what's
really happening in your customer base. 

 GEN AI PRESENT AND FUTURE: A CONVERSATION WITH NAVEEN ZUTSHI, CIO AT
DATABRICKS (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GenAI is transforming enterprise software by enhancing development
and intelligence systems, though challenges remain in areas like sales
and reliability. Databricks' CIO highlights improvements in AI-driven
tasks, such as automating manual processes and improving data handling
without needing additional staff. Startups benefit from GenAI by
focusing on automation, allowing them to scale rapidly and
efficiently.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 BEST PRACTICES FOR SELLING AI CREDITS, AND WHAT COMES NEXT (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 Most teams launch AI pricing fast, with credits. But credits are a
bridge, not a strategy. See why they work, where they break, and how
to move beyond them. Read the full breakdown on the Metronome blog
[11]. 

 FIRESIDE (TOOL) [12] 

 Ask for help on your toughest problems. 

 LEADBAY (TOOL) [13] 

 Discover and qualify SMB leads that others can't find.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FROM AGENT HYPE TO AGENT FATIGUE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Everyone said 2025 would be the year of AI agents, and they were
right, just not in the way they expected. Companies raced to rebrand
every workflow as “agentic,” but the reality is showing cracks:
40% of projects are predicted to fail by 2027, and employees are
burning out under the pressure to use tools they barely understand. 

 THE COFOUNDER RELATIONSHIP: YOUR STARTUP'S MOST IMPORTANT ASSET (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Founders obsess over product-market fit but overlook the partnership
that holds everything together. This piece argues that most startups
fail not from poor execution, but from unspoken tension between
cofounders. It breaks down the psychology of trust, emotional debt,
and communication styles that quietly shape every decision. 

 DATACURVE RAISES $15 MILLION TO TAKE ON SCALE AI (2 MINUTE READ) [17]


 Datacurve secured $15 million in Series A funding to compete with
Scale AI by offering high-quality data for software development. The
company uses a "bounty hunter" system to attract skilled engineers for
sourcing datasets, distributing over $1 million in bounties. Datacurve
emphasizes user experience to appeal to its contributors, aiming to
support complex AI data needs as they grow.
