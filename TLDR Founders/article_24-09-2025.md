 HOW SNOWFLAKE IS ADAPTING USAGE-BASED PRICING FOR THE AI ERA
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Snowflake's usage-based pricing has been one key driver of its market
leadership. In this webinar [4], you'll get an insider view of how the
team manages its pricing and billing, and how they're preparing for
the Al era of monetization.

Join Ryan Campbell, Director of Product Finance at Snowflake, and
Scott Woody, Metronome CEO, to learn how Snowflake aligns finance,
product, GTM, and engineering around pricing decisions. On the agenda:

 	* Reducing friction and accelerating pricing decisions
 	* Applying rigor and experimentation to your monetization model
 	* ﻿﻿Lessons from Snowflake [4] on designing pricing for
predictability, visibility, and control

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 STARTUP SALARIES, EQUITY, AND THEIR IMPACT ON EMPLOYEE RETENTION (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Startup pay shifted again this year. Salaries are up about 5%, with
product and engineering around $189k, while equity grants are roughly
26% below pre-2022, and only 32% of vested in-the-money options got
exercised. Early hires still get about 1.5% and employee five near
0.3%. Turnover fell 31% yet churn stays high. Retention improves when
pay is competitive, refreshes hit year three to four, and bands are
transparent. 

 VCBENCH: BENCHMARKING LLMS IN VENTURE CAPITAL (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Startup investing has long been guesswork, with even top VCs picking
winners less than 6% of the time. VCBench is trying to change that: a
dataset of 9,000 anonymized founder profiles built to test whether
models can predict success better than humans. After scrubbing names,
dates, and company info to prevent leakage, researchers ran nine LLMs.
GPT-4o delivered 3.2× baseline precision, edging past tier-1 firms. 

 GREPTILE SERIES A AND GREPTILE V3 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Greptile raised $25M Series A led by Benchmark Capital to advance its
AI code review agent, Greptile v3, which addresses scale issues in
code validation. The revamped agent detects 3x more critical bugs than
its predecessor and has reviewed over 500M lines of code for top
firms, preventing 180,000+ bugs. Greptile integrates with tools like
Jira and Notion for context-aware feedback and learns team practices
from PR comments to enhance code reviews.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO BUILD MENTAL STRENGTH (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mental strength goes hand in hand with clear thinking. It's what lets
you override your defaults instead of running on autopilot. You build
it through four trainable muscles: accountability, knowledge, control,
and confidence. Add high standards, rituals, and the right role
models, and those muscles compound into habits. 

 WHY CUSTOMER SUPPORT SHOULDN'T HANDLE YOUR PRODUCT FEEDBACK (11
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Customer support teams lack the skills and tools necessary to gather
actionable product feedback, often resulting in valuable insights
getting lost. Aligning customer support's incentives with quick ticket
resolution rather than in-depth feedback analysis contributes to this
issue. Companies should implement dedicated feedback systems to ensure
customers feel heard and product teams receive quality insights,
ultimately leading to improved product development and customer
satisfaction. 

 HOW TO LAUNCH YOUR STARTUP OUT OF STEALTH, FROM FIGMA'S FIRST
MARKETER (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Successful startup launches require strategic preparation,
emphasizing feature readiness and clear positioning. Set a specific
launch date to avoid perpetual delays and create artifacts like a
website, announcement post, and social post to sharpen messaging and
decisions. Focus on existing distribution channels, utilize personal
networks for amplification, and view the launch as a starting point
for growth rather than a final goal.

 NARRATIVE CYCLE ENTRY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Every technology story has a rhythm. First comes obscurity, when only
a few people care, and founders have to explain everything from
scratch. Then comes conviction, as believers pile in and copycats
multiply. Next is euphoria, when hype peaks and differentiation gets
hardest. Finally comes the crash, when the same idea is written off
until a few survivors prove it real again. Knowing where you enter
shapes whether you're explaining an unproven idea, competing in a
crowded field, or trying to rebuild belief after the hype has
collapsed. 

 TOWARD COMPUTATIONAL TASTE: LLMS, AESTHETICS & JUDGMENT (9 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 LLMs are being used to model and optimize taste in diverse fields
through personalized systems like Taste Engines, Aesthetic LLMs, and
Taste Tribes. Methods like LoRe and models like TAPO enable LLMs to
adapt to individual aesthetic preferences, potentially revolutionizing
recommendation engines and social networks. This shift towards
computational taste signifies a new era where machines not only
reflect but also shape human preferences, offering both cultural and
economic opportunities. 

 THE ONE-PERSON, BILLION-DOLLAR POWER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (10 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Power development has always been a slog: years of permits,
consultants, site visits, and spreadsheets that eat entire teams.
That's about to change. With new data systems, permitting software,
robotics, and orchestration tools, one person could realistically
manage hundreds of megawatts of projects and generate $100M in fees.
This piece explores how an industry known for red tape might collapse
into a one-person business model.
