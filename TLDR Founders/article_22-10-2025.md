HEADLINES & TRENDS

 OPENAI LAUNCHES AN AI-POWERED BROWSER (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered browser, starting on
macOS, with other platforms soon. The browser features built-in chat
capabilities and a sidecar feature for seamless user interaction. It
offers an AI agent for task automation but is limited to certain
subscription tiers at launch. 

 SESAME, THE CONVERSATIONAL AI STARTUP FROM OCULUS FOUNDERS, RAISES
$250M AND LAUNCHES BETA (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sesame, founded by Oculus alumni, raised $250 million in Series B
funding and launched a beta for its conversational AI app. The startup
aims to embed AI agents into smart glasses with a natural voice
interface. Sesame's tech is praised for its realistic dialogue, with
its beta iOS app offering features like search and text interaction. 

 LEAN STARTUP REBOOTED (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 For years, startups followed two playbooks: Lean Startup and
Blitzscaling. Blitzscaling won once AI arrived and VCs flooded the
space with capital. Now, as the AI bubble debate grows, the original
lean approach is making a comeback.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ONLY 100 METRICS MATTER (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Companies track thousands of numbers, but almost none of them change
decisions. In reality, about 100 metrics explain 90% of what's
happening. Once you break the business into equations - growth,
engagement, revenue - you see which levers actually matter. Everything
else lives in the long tail: useful for edge cases, not for running
the company. 

 WHY WE BUY: THE OMISSION BIAS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 People judge harmful actions more harshly than harmful inactions -
this is known as the “Omission Bias.” Buying feels riskier than
not buying because action carries blame if it backfires. Amazon and
others flip that bias by showing the cost of doing nothing. When
inaction feels like “the bad decision” - whether it's a higher
cart price, lost ROI, or missed deal - spending suddenly feels like
the safer move. 

 HOW STRUGGLE BECOMES STRATEGY (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Pejman Nozad reflects on his 32-year journey from living above a
yogurt shop to becoming a top Silicon Valley investor, framing early
hardship as the foundation of empathy and insight in venture capital.
He highlights lessons on perseverance, resourcefulness, and the power
of community in supporting founders through isolation and uncertainty.
His message centers on transforming struggle into strategy and using
personal adversity as an enduring advantage in investing and
leadership.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PRIORITIZATION STARTS WITH STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Most teams treat prioritization as a to-do list problem when it's
really a strategy problem. Every decision about what's “valuable”
reflects a bet on where leverage lives and where decay is setting in.
The real work is mapping the forces at play: what increases or
protects revenue, what reduces or protects cost, and which advantages
will actually last. Once you see those dynamics, prioritization stops
being about urgency and starts being about power. 

 ANTHROPIC IS CATCHING UP WITH OPENAI (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic quietly went from $1B to nearly $7B in run-rate revenue
this year, a six-fold jump that puts it within striking distance of
OpenAI. While OpenAI dominates headlines, Anthropic's API-driven
business is growing faster and more efficiently, relying less on free
users and more on enterprise integrations. Beneath the public fights
about AI ethics and regulation, the real story is simpler: Anthropic
might actually win on execution. 

 TWELVE YEARS, 400 STARTUPS, AND A NEW $87,654,321 FUND (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Boost VC launches an $87M Fund 4 to invest in 150 Deep Tech startups,
focusing on nuclear energy, genetics, and space travel. The fund
boosts Boost VC's assets under management to over $300M, with notable

Biosciences. Previous funds have shown strong returns, with Fund I
