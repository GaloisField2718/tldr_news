HEADLINES & TRENDS

 BEAUTY IS IN THE ALGORITHM OF THE BEHOLDER (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The evolution of beauty standards throughout history has been closely
tied to economic accessibility and social status, with desired traits
often shifting once they become widely attainable. As GLP-1
medications like Ozempic become more affordable and accessible, this
could trigger another significant shift in beauty ideals, similar to
historical examples like the European spice trade. This trend,
combined with modern technological advances in cosmetic procedures and
AI-powered image editing, suggests we're entering a new era where
traditional markers of beauty and status may fundamentally change. 

 DEFENSIBILITY: POWER WITHIN THE AI STACK (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The market dynamics of the AI technology stack are being shaped by
factors like compute hardware requirements, foundation model
development, and infrastructure needs. Large tech companies and cloud
providers dominate the data center compute market, while local
inference capabilities are becoming increasingly important for both
consumer devices and embedded systems. The economics of foundation
models present unique challenges, with massive capital requirements
for development but rapid depreciation of value as newer, more capable
models emerge. 

 AMERICA'S SUPERPOWER (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Americans should be thankful for their country's electoral system,
which embodies the concept of "optionality," allowing citizens the
ability to change the nation's direction every four years. This system
prevents the stagnation seen in countries with one-party rule, such as
Argentina and China, by enabling vibrant democracies to adapt and
self-correct, ultimately fostering economic resilience and global
alliances. Despite the tensions and divisions that tight elections can
cause, they are crucial for maintaining the flexibility and dynamism
that underpin American democracy.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY YOUR SELF-SERVE MOTION SUCKS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Companies often face a disconnect between their successful sales-led
enterprise deals and underperforming self-serve motions. This
disparity typically stems from attracting the wrong customers,
ineffective self-serve experiences, or misaligned pricing and
packaging for lower-end market customers. Addressing these issues
requires aligning self-serve acquisition with enterprise success
patterns, embedding sales tactics into the product experience, and
optimizing pricing structures to reflect value across all customer
segments. 

 HOW LUME USES BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Overcoming the challenge of finding an effective natural deodorant,
Lumē's success story shows how understanding consumer pain points and
leveraging buyer psychology can transform a product into a must-have
solution. Developed by Dr. Shannon Klingman, Lumē addresses body odor
by neutralizing odor-causing bacteria without using baking soda. The
company utilizes authority bias, labor illusion, humor, and strategic
framing to effectively market its benefits. This has led to a rapid
acquisition by Harry's in just four years. 

 WHY CANDIDATE ASSIGNMENTS ARE THE BEST ASSESSMENT TOOL (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Interviews, resumes, and references are okay for assessing candidate
characteristics but terrible at evaluating abilities. Assignments that
simulate real work constraints are the best way to test skills,
critical thinking, and process. Great assignments aren't free
consulting, but rather a chance for both sides to assess fit. The key
is designing assignments that test the right things while respecting
candidate time. While this may cause some potential candidates to drop
out, the tradeoff of a smaller but better-suited pool is worth it.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOAL-O-RAMA (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Different types of goals can be strategically combined to create a
more comprehensive and effective goal-setting framework. This post
provides examples from overarching primary goals to
capability-building objectives, each serving distinct purposes like
hitting specific targets, maintaining progress, or building new
capabilities. These various goal types can be mixed and matched to
create a balanced approach that addresses both immediate targets and
long-term sustainability. 

 HAS AI SCALING HIT A LIMIT? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 As AI reaches the second anniversary of ChatGPT, the assumption that
intelligence improves with scaling is being questioned. Recent
evidence suggests that merely increasing model size, data, and
computational power may not continue to yield significant
advancements, highlighting potential diminishing returns and barriers
such as data scarcity, energy demands, and architectural limitations.
The future may require new paradigms, including test-time compute and
novel architectures, to move beyond current constraints and foster
more diverse approaches to AI development. 

 IN SILICON VALLEY, NO ANSWER IS AN ANSWER (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Silicon Valley's unique business culture often leaves founders facing
the paradox of busy influential people willing to help but unable to
respond to communications. It's culturally acceptable in this
environment not to reply to new email requests as a form of "no,"
which can be challenging for those seeking closure. To adapt, one
should understand this etiquette, avoid sending angry follow-ups, and
recognize that a lack of response isn't always permanent - it's
possible to revisit opportunities in the future.

QUICK LINKS

creation. 

 SAM ALTMAN ON THE BIGGEST MISTAKE STARTUP CEOS MAKE (2 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Recruitment is often prioritized over retention in the early stages
of a startup, but a shift to focus on retaining top talent is crucial
to avoid potential issues. 

 HOW BIG SHOULD THE ADDRESSABLE MARKET BE TO GO INTO VERTICAL SAAS? (1
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 High-value vertical SaaS companies typically succeed through one of
two main revenue paths: either securing 5,000+ customers at $20,000+
annual contracts or acquiring 100,000+ customers at lower price points
around $1,000 per year.
