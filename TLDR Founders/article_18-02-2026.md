 THE HIDDEN STACK BEHIND AI APPS THAT MAKE IT TO PRODUCTION (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Most AI apps fail to reach production not because of models, but
because of the invisible infrastructure layer underneath. Enterprise
customers expect identity that works with their provider, permissions
that reflect their org, directory sync that provisions their users,
and security that responds in real time.

WorkOS is the enterprise infrastructure layer powering the AI wave.
[5] OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, and hundreds of the fastest-growing AI
companies build on WorkOS so they can focus on their product, not the
stack beneath it.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THREE DOMINANT MODELS OF TODAY'S VERTICAL AI HORSERACE (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Public SaaS market caps continue to free-fall while VC keeps
investing in vertical AI at frothy valuations. There are three models
emerging, and they require completely different playbooks. Model 1
sells AI-powered software to incumbents - de-risked GTM, but
innovation ceiling. Model 2 acquires businesses and deploys AI to
improve unit economics across a portfolio - immediate revenue, but
integration nightmares. Model 3 builds the business from scratch as an
AI-native replacement - maximum value capture, but cold start and
regulatory hurdles. Many companies are choosing a model whose physics
don't match their market. 

 YOU'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE ARENA, YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Humans can't compete with AI anymore, and most won't notice until
it's too late. Companies are now competing with startups that can do
everything they can do, but with AI, and without thinking about or
working too hard. To compete, companies need to get everyone
up-skilled immediately, start trying new tools, and remove barriers
and the employees who are resistant to change. They should try to
rebuild their product from scratch - if it takes less than two weeks,
ask what that means for their company.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BUILDING ON SAND: THE HIDDEN COST OF AI MODEL CHURN (13 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 AI pushes technical complexity upstream into the problem space, where
the PM lives. This means the PM must become the architect because
architecture is now a product artifact. An AI model update can
invalidate assumptions, making it impossible to define products, user
experience, feasibility, or cost. The only way to build durable AI
products is to design systems that assume the model will change. 

 HOW TO SELL TO AGENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In 1937, Ronald Coase asked why firms existed if markets are so
efficient. His answer was transaction costs. AI agents are about to
collapse those costs to near zero. An agent can discover a service,
check its price, and call it in a single HTTP round-trip. HTTP 402 -
"Payment Required" - has been reserved for future use since 1997.
We're finally finding that use. The web was built for humans to
browse. The next layer will be built for agents to buy. 

 THE FUTURE OF B2B MARKETING IS AI AGENT RECOMMENDATIONS. AND AI
AGENTS PLAY FAVORITES (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 87% of B2B software buyers say AI chatbots are changing how they
research. LLM traffic is projected to overtake traditional search by
the end of 2026. Economic party is expected even sooner due to
significantly higher conversion rates from AI-referred traffic. The
companies that figure out how to become the recommended answer will
have an almost insurmountable distribution advantage.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NAVIGATING A PARADIGM SHIFT (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The hardest part of a paradigm shift is navigating it while it's
incomplete. Paradigm shifts are tectonic shifts beneath markets,
technologies, and human thought. They begin quietly at first, then the
world suddenly bends. Paradigm shifts begin with dissonance, not
consensus, as the old ways no longer fit the new reality. The best
founders understand why the current system works, but believe there
are better ways to do things. 

 A PRIMER ON FACTORY ECONOMICS FOR STARTUPS (20 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Tesla popularized the "factory-is-the-product" thesis. It now applies
to companies making drone motors, robot actuators, PCBs, and battery
packs. The learning curve is central to strategy: for each doubling of
cumulative production, costs fall predictably. Your competitive
position depends on where you are on the curve, how fast you descend,
and whether you can finance the journey.
