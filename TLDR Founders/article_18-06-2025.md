HEADLINES & TRENDS

 A LOOK BACK AT Q1 '25 PUBLIC CLOUD SOFTWARE EARNINGS (4 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Cloud software's net new ARR dropped 28% year-over-year in Q1, but
guidance tells a different story. 67% of companies guided above
consensus for Q2 (up from 50% last quarter), while 92% beat Q1
estimates with a median 2.2% beat, suggesting the worst of the
slowdown may be behind the industry despite headline growth numbers. 

 POSTHOG VS. THE INDUSTRY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 PostHog raised $70 million from Stripe by breaking every SaaS rule:
open-source products, generous free tiers, no outbound sales, price
cuts instead of increases, and protection against viral usage spikes.
While Salesforce hikes prices 6% annually, PostHog proves there's room
for startups that do the exact opposite of what private equity-backed
software companies typically do. 

 WAYMO+UBER MARKET DYNAMICS AS TESLA TESTS THE ROBOTAXI WATERS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Waymo captured 25% of San Francisco rideshare despite premium
pricing, but Austin tells the real story. The Waymo+Uber exclusive
partnership there has stolen 7 percentage points of market share from
Lyft in months, while consumer surveys show 77% won't use Tesla FSD
and 48% believe it should be illegal - a tough backdrop for Tesla's
rumored June 22nd robotaxi launch.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE FEAR-AVOIDANCE MODEL: WHY BUYERS FREEZE AT "BUY NOW" (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Even savvy buyers with compelling products freeze at checkout buttons
after one bad purchase experience. Research shows fear of pain creates
stronger avoidance than actual pain itself. One company breaks this
psychological loop with $1 trials instead of free ones - customers
cross the payment barrier while risking almost nothing, then sunk cost
bias drives engagement. 

 DIFFERENT KINDS OF SMART (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Long Term Capital Management's collapse highlights that intelligence
comes in various forms, some of which aren't easily measured.
Successful problem-solving in business requires connecting
interdisciplinary dots, balancing confidence with paranoia, and
effective storytelling. Moreover, acknowledging different perspectives
and delaying gratification by strategic distraction is critical in
making informed and enduring decisions. 

 IS ALL MICROMANAGEMENT BAD? HERE'S HOW THE BEST FOUNDERS AND
OPERATORS BALANCE DETAILS AND DELEGATION (24 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Micromanagement is not inherently bad. Effective leaders use it
strategically to model standards and drive focus in key areas.
Founders and executives advocate balancing detailed involvement with
delegation, focusing on data discrepancies, system reviews, and
empowering teams through feedback. Leaders can leverage
micromanagement wisely to support team autonomy while maintaining
quality and clarity on priorities.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE MAN WHO BEAT IBM (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 How do you kill a monopoly? Give away your secrets to competitors.
When IBM tried to reclaim PC control with proprietary technology in
1988, Compaq's Rod Canion turned down exclusive access to IBM's
next-gen tech and instead shared Compaq's "clean room" BIOS
reverse-engineering method with eight rivals, creating the open
standard that broke Big Blue's stranglehold on personal computing. 

 THE EXIT READY ORG (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 What gets deals moving forward is boring operational discipline, and
what kills them is needing two weeks to answer basic financial
questions. Flywheel's CFO closed an unsolicited acquisition in 31 days
because of preparedness: its ARR waterfalls were already reconciled,
every KPI had a person's name (not a department) next to it, and
pulling a bookings report took 30 seconds.

 What's the secret to 97% message automation? Don't try to replace
your core UI with chat. Keeper learned this after 4 years of iteration

entry and structured displays to traditional UI, resulting in 230%
higher user engagement and 9-point CSAT jump.
