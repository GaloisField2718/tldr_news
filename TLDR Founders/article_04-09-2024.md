HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE NEW NORMAL FOR SAAS (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The SaaS industry has experienced a significant slowdown in growth
since 2021, with new business acquisitions becoming more complex and
expensive. As a result, companies are shifting their focus towards
retention and expansion, with Net Revenue Retention (NRR) becoming a
critical metric for sustaining long-term growth. Companies with high
NRR tend to grow faster and are more resilient to economic downturns,
but achieving a 100%+ NRR is becoming increasingly challenging,
especially for larger companies with a high subscriber count. 

 BACKCASTING FROM KNOWN AI SCALING LAWS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The current state of AI scaling laws presents a compelling
opportunity for entrepreneurs to create value, even without
considering unforeseen breakthroughs. By studying known trends and
backcasting from possible futures, entrepreneurs can identify
inflections and gather insights to build breakthrough companies. The
cost of intelligence is falling rapidly, and the physical compute
required to achieve a given performance in language models is
declining, making it an exciting time for innovation in the field. 

 FOR POSTSCRIPT, THE FUTURE OF MARKETING IS AI-POWERED AND DELIVERED
VIA TEXT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Adam Turner, CEO of Postscript, discovered that only a quarter of
consumers who signed up for marketing texts made purchases, prompting
him to enhance the company's automated messaging with human sales
associates to address consumer concerns directly. This approach led to
a significant increase in purchase rates, with 60% of consumers who
interacted with sales associates making purchases. Postscript now aims
to scale this personalized interaction using AI tools, allowing for
more effective and personalized marketing experiences across its
customer base.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SALES TAX FOR SAAS COMPANIES (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sales tax compliance has become increasingly complex for tech
companies, especially after the 2018 Supreme Court decision in South
Dakota v. Wayfair, which introduced the concept of "economic nexus."
The ruling requires businesses to collect sales tax in states where
they have no physical presence if they meet certain sales thresholds,
making it crucial for companies to manage their sales tax obligations
to avoid financial and legal risks. Understanding the nuances of sales
tax, including nexus rules and product taxability, is essential for
tech companies to effectively manage their financial strategy and
minimize potential liabilities. 

 2 VERY COMMON MISTAKES THAT CAN KILL YOUR STARTUP (4 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Founders of startups face significant challenges, including long
hours and the need to handle various aspects of the business until
they can hire specialized staff. A study by Harvard, Stanford, and the
University of Chicago found that 55% of startups fail due to
people-related issues, such as conflicts between co-founders and poor
decision-making. It is important to understand co-founders'
motivations and maintain focus to avoid distractions. 

 FRAMEWORK FOR GROWING CONSUMER SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESSES (26 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Growth advisor and angel investor Phil Carter has developed a
framework called the Subscription Value Loop to help grow consumer
subscription businesses, drawing from his experience and analysis of
over 30,000 apps. Consumer subscription apps face challenges such as
high churn rates, low ARPU, and dependence on paid acquisition, but
successful apps can overcome these by building a strong core value
promise and leveraging strategies like optimizing onboarding, pricing,
and retention tactics. By understanding and enhancing the Subscription
Value Loop, companies can improve metrics like LTV/CAC and Payback
Period, driving sustainable growth.

 NOTES ON ‚ÄúFOUNDER MODE‚Äù (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Investor Paul Graham's essay "Founder Mode" discusses two distinct
leadership styles for running a company: founder mode and management
mode. The essay argues that when founders are pressured to adopt
management mode as their company scales, it can lead to negative
outcomes. However, the specific criticisms against management mode may
be overstated, and the real question should be how to effectively
operate in founder mode while adapting to the company's changing
needs. 

 THE THREE MOST COMMON CHALLENGES WITH FREEMIUM‚ÄîAND HOW TO FIX THEM
(4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 With interest rates staying high, many software companies are
reassessing their free tier offerings to improve their pricing
strategy. A well-designed free tier should offer enough value to
attract users while also creating a clear incentive to upgrade to a
paid tier. By identifying and addressing common pitfalls, such as
offering a free tier that is too generous or too restrictive, or
pricing the paid tier too expensively, companies can refine their
pricing strategy to boost growth and revenue. 

 GROWTH PRODUCT ORG CHARTS (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 To effectively structure a Growth team, start with a small, agile
team focused on experimentation across the customer journey,
consisting of a Growth Product Manager, a Data Scientist, a few
Engineers, and some design and marketing support. As the team
demonstrates positive ROI and gains traction with key metrics, it can
scale into a more structured organization with multiple squads, each
focusing on different growth levers such as acquisition, activation,
monetization, and retention, while being careful to own specific
surfaces and maintain them with the help of a Growth Infrastructure
team.
