HEADLINES & TRENDS

 ALFRED LIN ON DECISION QUALITY (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Long-term relevance in an AI-dominated world comes from learning to
make strong decisions under uncertainty rather than mastering any
single technical field. Being right, which centers on ego and rigid
beliefs, is different from getting it right, which requires curiosity,
updating views, and detaching identity from ideas. Leaders who
prioritize getting it right foster open debate, psychological safety,
and faster progress. Ego-driven cultures slow teams and limit
contribution. 

 NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO SELL YOUR COMPANY (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Valuations have grown faster than fundamentals, and corporate balance
sheets are unusually strong. Antitrust risk is about to rise, so
selling before this shift is rational. Acquirers are overlooking
unhealthy financials because they fear missing out on AI or
automation. IPO markets may reopen, but most major private companies
are still staying away from going public.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR EXPERTS WON'T TRAIN YOUR AI. YOU HAVE TO INTERVIEW THEM (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The most valuable asset in every organization is the hard-won,
implicit knowledge inside the heads of its best people. Chatbots fail
because they produce generic AI that averages out expertise into
blandness. The only way to capture true expertise is to build an AI
interviewer that earns the trust to be seen as a peer. This article
discusses how 99ravens cleared this technical hurdle. 

 NOTES ON BUILDING IN THE AI ERA (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 a16z General Partner Anish Acharya recently appeared on a podcast to
discuss the speed/emergent properties of this product cycle, founder
psychology in a period of intense competition, unbundling tasks from
jobs, and AI native networks. a16z's core thesis is that founders make
the best long-term CEOs. They have unique knowledge and networks -
a16z builds its structure to provide these resources to founders
indefinitely. A link to the full podcast, along with notes from the
discussion, is available in the post. 

 FROM 10 TO 31 TASKS DAILY: THE AGENT INFLECTION POINT (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 The velocity of work changes instantly when we give agents the right
tools. Businesses can now use agents to complete tasks, just like
software engineers have been doing for the last several months. It is
now possible to spin up multiple parallel workstreams, multiplying
daily output without working longer hours. The agent inflection point
is already here.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT US WITHOUT US (17 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 You have to tell a story so clear, so concise, and memorable, and so
evocative, that people repeat it for you even after you've left the
room. This means that the people who hear it need to be able to do
this the first time they hear the story. You have to explain your idea
and make your case while teaching the listener how to do the same
thing themselves. Delivering this kind of story requires actual
substance - fakery is immediately obvious. 

 USING LLMS AT OXIDE (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 LLM use is encouraged at Oxide, but its use must be responsible to
the product and to its customers. This article discusses Oxide's
approach to using LLMs. It covers the company's values in LLM usage,
the different use cases for LLMs, and more. A document that details
specific tips is linked in the article.
