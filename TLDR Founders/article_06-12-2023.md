HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE TOP 3 THINGS CROS ARE TALKING ABOUT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Macro and longer sales cycles aside, this article covers the top
three things CROs are losing sleep over. They don‚Äôt think remote
onboarding is working well enough, the candidate pipeline is weak, and
Customer Success is dropping the bag. 

 REID HOFFMAN ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF GREAT FOUNDERS (13 MINUTE READ) [6]


 What makes an exceptional founder? This long read contains Reid
Hoffman‚Äôs (Partner at Greylock and the co-founder of LinkedIn)
thoughts on this. The central theme is all around the right founder,
at the right time, in the right market. These three elements together
create special things. 

 ON PLATFORM SHIFTS AND AI (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The conversation at the 2022 TCV Engage Summit highlighted that while
AI represents a technological shift, it lacks a new distribution
channel, which is crucial for creating significant consumer
opportunities. Current AI innovations must rely on traditional
distribution methods, favoring established companies or innovative
startups, but the potential for new distribution platforms remains
uncertain.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE SAAS FUNDRAISING NAPKIN (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Broader commentary on the state of software funding and growth metric
benchmarks. As you‚Äôd expect, growth rates and NDR are generally down
versus previous years and startups are being pushed to reach breakeven
at the later stages. If all the Series C and D startups break even,
you could argue the only reason they‚Äôd need growth investors is for
M&A. 

 5 CHALLENGES MOVING UPMARKET AND HOW TO OVERCOME THEM (6 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Crossing the chasm to enterprise, aka traditional late adopters or
laggards, is really hard. It requires you to build an entirely new
enterprise sales muscle, which simply takes time. The new direction
has to be fully embodied by the organization. Here are some things to
keep in mind as you consider the move. 

 MANAGING UP AND MANAGING DOWN (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In business, leaders must balance "managing down," which involves
guiding and making decisions for their teams, and "managing up," where
they navigate their relationship with higher-ups, influencing
decisions and sometimes accepting overrules. This dual responsibility
requires skillful handling of different scenarios to enhance team
success and effectively contribute to the organization.

 ARTISANS: TASE IN SOFTWARE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Shipping things quickly, learning quickly, launching an MVP and
iterating has defined software product building to date. Production
speed is more important than craft. There‚Äôs a wave of new successful
startups, like Superhuman and Linear, that are prioritizing building a
rounded delightful product before it reaches the hands of consumers.
Artisan software represents this trend towards optimizing UX from day
one. 

 WORKING EXTRA HOURS CAN LEAD TO PRODUCTIVITY DECLINES (4 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 As founders, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to not work long hours in most
cases. The same is likely true for your early hires. Here‚Äôs a
reminder that productivity is not linear. Hours of input do not
directly correlate to output. 

 DEATH OF A FLYWHEEL (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway face a "scaled-out problem" due to
their immense success, where growth becomes challenging as they expand
into less profitable or more complex business areas. While Amazon
experiments across various sectors like entertainment and healthcare,
Berkshire prefers concentrated buyouts and equity purchases, yet both
strategies reflect the complexity and risks of managing enormous
companies at the peak of their success.

 WHY ENTREPRENEURS SHOULD LOOK FOR IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGES (8 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 There‚Äôs a little space just before impossible. It‚Äôs nearly
impossible. In other words, it‚Äôs really hard to do it. That‚Äôs
where entrepreneurs should focus. That‚Äôs where competition will be
thin, daunted by the challenge, and rewards outsized for those who
achieve the nearly impossible.
