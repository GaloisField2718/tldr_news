HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE RACE TO 150 (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Reaching an age of 150 years could be a breakthrough point in human
longevity, as it would likely mean that many age-related diseases have
been cured or managed, and that the body's natural decline has been
significantly slowed. Achieving this milestone could lead to an
exponential increase in healthy life expectancy, making it
theoretically possible to live indefinitely in good health. A
fundamental shift, from a "sick care" approach to a true "health care"
approach focused on preventing and reversing the underlying causes of
aging and disease, is needed to get there. 

 ‚ÄúDEATH OF A SALESFORCE‚Äù: WHY AI WILL TRANSFORM THE NEXT
GENERATION OF SALES TECH (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Artificial intelligence is poised to revolutionize the sales industry
by fundamentally changing the core system of record and sales
workflows. Early AI-native sales solutions are enabling new proactive
sales motions and evolving to serve multiple use cases, blurring the
lines between traditional sales, marketing, and customer success
roles. As AI becomes more prevalent in sales, pricing models may shift
from per-seat to outcome-based, and go-to-market strategies will
become more fluid and adaptable to individual customer needs. 

 WHAT IS ‚ÄúUNDERCONSUMPTION CORE‚Äù? (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new trend called "underconsumption core" is gaining popularity
among Gen Z, who are rejecting influencer marketing and embracing
minimalism by only purchasing what they need. This shift towards less
consumption is partially driven by economic pressures such as
inflation, rising costs, and debt faced by Gen Z. The trend reflects a
growing distrust in influencers and their authority, as well as a
desire for simplicity and frugality in response to financial
anxieties.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO FIGURE OUT METRICS OWNERSHIP (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Defining clear ownership of key metrics is crucial for avoiding
organizational friction and slowdowns. Metrics can be owned outright
by one team, shared between teams, or handed off when a team's ability
to impact the metric declines. Mapping out the current and ideal
ownership states for each metric, then taking steps to transition
metrics to their ideal owners, helps align teams and drive progress. 

 SO YOUR COMPANY IS PIVOTING ‚Äì HERE'S HOW TO RESPOND (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 A pivot may be necessary to achieve growth when a startup's current
business model isn't working, but it can be a challenging and chaotic
process for employees. To navigate a pivot successfully, it's
essential to evaluate the change, commit to the new direction, and
focus on the projects that matter. By doing so, employees can not only
help the company succeed, but also accelerate their own careers and
gain valuable experience in working through a crisis. 

 WHEN TO JOIN A STARTUP (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Five types of risk need to be eliminated to create a successful and
reliable business when building a startup: technology risk, market
risk, scaling risk, business model risk, and defensibility risk.
Understanding and assessing these risks is crucial for entrepreneurs,
investors, and potential employees to decide when to join or invest in
a startup. Individuals can make more strategic decisions that maximize
their potential for success and economic reward by recognizing when a
major risk is about to be removed.

 WHY LARGE ORGANIZATIONS STRUGGLE WITH DISRUPTION (7 MINUTE READ) [14]


 Organizations often struggle to adapt to disruptive technologies due
to various factors, including leadership hesitation, legacy
investments, resistance to change, and risk aversion. To successfully
navigate disruption, senior leaders must actively seek to understand
the timing, magnitude, and impact of the threat, and respond
accordingly through increased visibility of disruptive technologies,
evidence gathering, and organization-wide transformation when
necessary. 

 ZOMBIECALYPSE IN STARTUPLAND (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The current state of the venture capital industry is complex and
contradictory, with fierce competition for AI deals coexisting with a
large number of unicorn companies awaiting liquidity events. Public
SaaS companies are experiencing compressed multiples and slowing
growth rates, making it challenging for many growth-stage startups to
achieve successful exits through IPOs or acquisitions. Despite these
challenges, VCs continue to deploy capital aggressively into AI
startups, potentially exacerbating the existing backlog of high-priced
companies and creating a risk of a "zombie startup apocalypse" that
could impact the ability of emerging VC funds to raise subsequent
funds. 

 ‚ÄúAUTHENTIC‚Äù IS DEAD. AND SO IS ‚ÄúIS DEAD.‚Äù (4 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Overused phrases and buzzwords have lost their impact and meaning in
today's marketing landscape. Companies should strive to be specific,
demonstrative, and genuine in their communication instead of relying
on tired clich√©s. Businesses can earn credibility and stand out in a
crowded market by embracing authenticity and backing up claims with
concrete examples and actions.
