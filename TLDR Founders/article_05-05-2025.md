HEADLINES & TRENDS

 COULD FUNDS BRIDGE THE DIVIDE BETWEEN VC AND PE? (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 As thousands of "tweener" startups find themselves stranded in
today's funding environment, a new class of hybrid funds is emerging
to fill the gap. These funds target companies too mature for venture
capital but not profitable enough for private equity, buying them at
reduced valuations and implementing operational discipline. The
strategy resembles distressed-asset arbitrage with modern branding.
These funds often launch separate vehicles rather than repurposing
existing funds to maintain clean track records with investors. 

 DOES CURSOR HAVE A DEFENSIBLE MOAT? (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 With $300M ARR and a rumored $10B valuation, Cursor's growth raises
the question: how defensible is its position? The AI-powered coding
tool faces significant long-term challenges despite early traction.
The underlying LLM technology is rapidly commoditizing, while giants
like Microsoft and GitHub control both distribution channels and
vastly superior data for training models. Cursor's high valuation
assumes it will expand beyond an IDE into a full development platform,
but its data advantage remains tiny compared to GitHub's global
repository corpus. 

 THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AI IN HEALTHCARE IS HERE NOW! (8 MINUTE READ) [6]


 AI presents a transformative opportunity to massively improve
healthcare while creating substantial economic value. With declining
computation costs, AI can provide near-free expertise and effectively
diagnose, monitor, and tailor treatments, rivaling and exceeding human
clinicians. Despite cultural resistance and systemic obstacles like
billing codes, adopting AI can dramatically cut costs, enhance care
quality, and expand access, posing a significant opportunity for
innovative players in the healthcare industry.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PRODUCT PURGATORY: WHEN THEY LOVE IT BUT DON'T BUY (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Why do customers praise your product but never purchase? This
frustrating gap between enthusiasm and action signals "product
purgatory"—your solution may be valuable but lacks urgency. The
insightful "Magic-Wand Test" reveals whether your product fails due to
perceived value or activation hurdles. If prospects would take it
fully implemented for free yet still won't buy, your challenge isn't
the product but its priority level (usually #7 on their list). The
solution isn't to add features, but to narrow your focus to customers
facing immediate catalysts like regulatory deadlines or leadership
mandates where urgency drives decisions. 

 HOW TO NOT BREAK UP WITH YOUR COFOUNDER (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cofounders often split before their company succeeds. To prevent
this, share equity equally no matter who has more experience, write
down your good and bad feelings weekly, share rooms on business trips
to talk more, and work on what each of you cares about rather than
sticking to rigid job titles. Start meetings with opportunities, not
just problems, and when you disagree, solve it by writing down
principles you both believe in. 

 HEURISTICS TO SIMPLIFY DESIGN DECISION-MAKING (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design gets easier when you follow simple rules instead of starting
from scratch every time. Some useful ones: stick with patterns users
already know, keep choices to seven or fewer, make response times
under 400ms, and focus effort on what makes your product special while
using standard designs for everything else. These shortcuts help you
make good decisions faster without getting stuck in endless debates.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE SCORPION BOX (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A disturbing University of Zurich study, which used year-old models
that weren't cutting-edge, found AI responses on Reddit were 3-6 times
more persuasive than human posts. While AI companies focus on
technical "alignment," the real danger may be systems that evolve to
subtly convince us of almost anything through rhetorical techniques we
can't detect, similar to how social media platforms initially promised
connection but ultimately optimized for engagement that polarized
society. 

 CLAWBACKS IN VENTURE CAPITAL (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The structure of venture capital compensation creates potential
misalignment when early winners mask later failures. Clawback
provisions require VCs to return excess carried interest if the final
fund performance falls short, aligning long-term interests between
investors and managers. The strength of these provisions—including
timing tests, personal guarantees, and tax considerations—signals
how seriously GPs take partnership with their LPs. Beyond legal
mechanics, robust clawbacks reflect a cultural commitment to shared
outcomes rather than opportunistic profit-taking. 

 THE VOLUME OF YOUR INACCURACY (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Online, the loudest people often seem right even when they're wrong.
We see big follower counts and think they must know what they're
talking about. However, being loud doesn't make someone right - it
just makes them heard. While we can't fix this system where volume
beats accuracy, we can at least try to stay honest ourselves while
playing this game.

QUICK LINKS

 LUCK IS MOSTLY JUST MATH (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 What we perceive as "luck" often boils down to simple mathematical
consistency. 

 THERE ARE ONLY TWO STAGES (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Stripping away venture capital jargon reveals a simpler truth:
companies exist in either a "risk" stage (seeking breakthrough
outcomes) or "scale" stage (predictable growth). 

 KLARNA AND STUBHUB DELAY IPOS BECAUSE OF TRUMP TARIFF TURMOIL (1
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Klarna and StubHub are pausing their anticipated IPOs due to market
volatility from recent tariff announcements.
