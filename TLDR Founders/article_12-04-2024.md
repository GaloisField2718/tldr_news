HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE AI WORKFORCE IS HERE: THE RISE OF A NEW LABOR MARKET (6 MINUTE
READ) [3] 

 This article discusses the evolving landscape of B2B SaaS, where AI
is increasingly capable of executing tasks without human intervention,
merging the labor and software markets and creating opportunities for
startups to offer "AI colleagues" that perform job functions and "AI
vendors/services" that automate entire workflows. This shift is
expected to expand markets, increase margins, and lead to the creation
of new types of companies, while also necessitating rapid workforce
re-skilling and potentially transforming large businesses to be run by
minimal human staff. 

 THE TELEHEALTH TIPPING POINT (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Telehealth startups, such as Honeydew for dermatology, are improving
access to healthcare in the US by leveraging technology and changing
consumer behaviors. Despite poor health outcomes and high healthcare
costs in the US, these vertical telehealth companies are emerging
across various specialties, providing more convenient and accessible
care. They offer healthcare professionals opportunities to supplement
their income or work full-time. 

 WIZ: SCALING FROM $1M ARR TO $100M ARR IN 18 MONTHS (6 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Wiz, the fastest-growing software company ever, achieved explosive
growth and a $10B valuation in just 3 years by offering a disruptive
cloud-native security platform that provides enterprises with unified
visibility and protection across multi-cloud environments. Investors
were attracted to Wiz due to the founding team's strong track record
and ability to execute, the product's technological innovations and
intuitive UI, the acute market need driven by the complexity of
securing cloud environments, and the company's rapid adoption by large
enterprise customers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HUMOR FOR GROWTH: THE STRATEGY YOU'RE MISSING (18 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Startups can use humor in clever and appropriate ways as a growth
strategy. This has the effect of humanizing their product and making
it more memorable to buyers. However, it can't be slapstick - humor
has to be deployed correctly in a way that shows your nuanced
understanding of the market, delights with surprise, and connects your
company to common experiences felt by those in the industry. 

 THE MONETIZATION PLAYBOOK WE USED AT EVENTBRITE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Eventbrite's journey to profitability involved a strategic shift in
its monetization approach. By evaluating each feature based on its
impact on key growth metrics like virality, activation, retention, and
willingness to pay, the company developed a playbook that maximized
both revenue and network effects. The team strategically bundled
features into tiered packages, charging for differentiated, high-value
offerings while giving away those that drove user adoption and
engagement. 

 SAAS COGS VS. OPEX (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Accurately categorizing costs as Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS) and
Operational Expenses (OpEx) is key to calculating Gross Profit Margins
(GPM), a crucial metric for SaaS scalability and profitability. This
article provides a refresher on relevant P&L items, typical CoGS items
in SaaS, and benchmarks for GPM. A GPM of 75-80%+ is considered good,
with higher percentages potentially leading to better valuations at
exit.

 THE MESSY REALITY BEHIND A SILICON VALLEY UNICORN (8 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 For 19 months, sociologist Benjamin Shestakofsky studied the inner
workings of AllDone, a tech startup that became a Silicon Valley
unicorn by creating a digital marketplace for local services. It
heavily relied on Filipino contractors to manually perform tasks
assumed to be automated, which allowed the company to rapidly scale
despite its software engineers being frequently preoccupied with
recruitment. This reliance on low-cost manual labor highlights the
persistent role of human workers in the automation era and underscores
the global inequalities that technological advancements continue to
exploit. 

 AI WILL NOT REPLACE SEARCH AND SEO WILL NEVER DIE (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Despite the rise of AI and language models like ChatGPT, search
engines and SEO will remain relevant and important. While AI-powered
tools can assist with various SEO tasks, they cannot fully replace the
human expertise and decision-making required to develop and execute a
successful SEO strategy. Businesses that recognize and adapt to this
reality will be well-positioned to succeed in the future.

structuring teams for flexibility, managing costs, and internally
testing features before release.
