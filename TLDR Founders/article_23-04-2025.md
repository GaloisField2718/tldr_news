HEADLINES & TRENDS

 (STILL) NO EXITS FOR PRIVATE CAPITAL (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Private investors sit on mountains of paper wealth with few exits as
PE acquisitions hit lows while capital calls outpace distributions.
The gap between calls and distributions approaches ZIRP-era levels,
creating negative cash flow for LPs. Despite liquidity issues, panic
remains absent—just a gap between valuations and returns. The
message stands clear: the "grow at all costs" playbook fails in a
world where capital costs more, investors need returns, and buyers
demand profit before paying prices that deliver investor returns. 

 IS PRODUCT MARKET FIT GETTING HARDER TO KEEP? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI companies can now rocket to $100M revenue in months instead of
years, but with this speed comes instability – many lose
product-market fit just as quickly as they find it. Once, hitting PMF
meant five years of stability. Now, companies cycle through PMF three
times in two years as competition intensifies. This creates a "false
peak" problem where founders mistake temporary growth for lasting
success.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW DBT LABS BUILT A $4.2B SOFTWARE BUSINESS OUT OF A TWO-PERSON
CONSULTANCY (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tristan Handy never planned to build a billion-dollar company—he
wanted a safer path than the VC startup grind when he started his data
consultancy in 2016. His tool dbt fixed a data pipeline gap by letting
analysts transform raw data using SQL. By first bootstrapping for four
years, Handy stayed connected to user problems while dbt spread to
1,000 companies, growing 3X yearly through word-of-mouth. This patient
approach, which solved his own problems so well that others couldn't
resist his solution, eventually forced him to raise capital and scale
to today's $4.2B valuation. 

 GOAL GRADIENT EFFECT (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Goal Gradient Effect, discovered when rats ran faster as they
approached food rewards, explains why we sprint to finish that fitness
app streak, spend $45 more just to unlock free shipping, and complete
coffee loyalty cards faster when given two "bonus" stamps upfront.
Smart businesses leverage this psychology by visually displaying
progress (like Ulta showing exactly how close you are to free shipping
or Apple's closing fitness rings) to create an irresistible pull that
transforms hesitant browsers into buyers who can't resist closing the
gap to completion. 

 FOUNDER BOREOUT IS A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN FOUNDER BURNOUT (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Founder burnout - pushing through those endless workweeks until you
crash - gets all the headlines. However, what about founder boreout?
That empty feeling when you're stuck doing boring admin tasks instead
of the exciting work that made you start your company. Instead of
scrolling Twitter while trudging through your inbox (which just makes
it worse), try turning mundane work into games—racing to clear your
tasks, creating smarter workflows, or finding clever hacks like
Feynman did with his bean-cutting technique. Sometimes the fix for
feeling bored isn't stepping back, but leaning in.

 Terrestrial Energy, a company developing integral molten salt

 BALANCING PROCESS VS. PRODUCT MINDSETS FOR PRODUCT SUCCESS (9 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Product managers must balance between process and product mindsets to
optimize team strategy and outcomes. A process mindset focuses on
efficiency and predefined workflows, while a product mindset
prioritizes user value and adaptability. Successful management
involves leveraging both mindsets according to specific project needs
and organizational culture.
