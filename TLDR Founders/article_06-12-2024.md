HEADLINES & TRENDS

 10 CHARTS THAT CAPTURE HOW THE WORLD IS CHANGING (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The global landscape is experiencing significant shifts across
prediction markets, venture capital, and consumer behavior. Emerging
platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket are revolutionizing how people
monetize knowledge through betting on real-world outcomes, while the
experience economy is making a strong comeback with consumers
increasingly prioritizing memorable events over material goods.
Meanwhile, the space industry is undergoing a remarkable
transformation with a dramatic surge in satellite launches driven by
falling costs and growing venture capital interest. 

 PRODUCT POSITIONING (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Product positioning is a strategic decision centered on choosing a
target customer segment and differentiating the product to meet their
needs. Effective positioning requires identifying use case-based
segments (focused on specific workflows or activities) rather than
relying solely on firmographics, with the goal of aligning messaging
and strategy for sustainable differentiation. This process, owned by
the CEO, sets the foundation for consistent messaging and
product-market alignment, with the homepage acting as a key
communication asset.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 REFLECTIONS ON A FAILED COMPUTER VISION STARTUP (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 DirectAI, a startup focused on computer vision solutions without data
collection or labeling, faced challenges despite innovative technology
and some successful customer implementations. The company discovered
that while its product could effectively serve niche use cases and
replace traditional computer vision tools, the limited market size for
each specific application made it difficult to achieve venture-scale
growth. After multiple pivots and stagnant growth, the founders made
the decision to shut down operations in September 2024, though some
customers continue to use their open-sourced service. 

 BUILDING SALES COMMISSION PLANS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To create effective sales commission plans, teams must collaborate
cross-functionally and understand key concepts. The primary objective
is to incentivize reps to win customers who achieve successful
outcomes and strong lifetime value, not just to close deals. This
requires careful planning around OTE, quota, accelerators, ramp time,
renewal/expansion rates, and clawbacks. 

 LANDING PAGE TIPS TO INCREASE CONVERSIONS BY 5X (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Not all landing pages are built to convert. Successful landing pages
can generate a significant amount of revenue. While a well-optimized
landing page can drive a significant amount of revenue, failing to
understand the psychology and key design principles behind it can
result in wasted time and resources. 48% of visitors leave after
viewing just the first page, without engaging with any marketing
materials - giving you only a brief window to capture their attention.
However, by following a few proven steps, you can increase your
landing page's conversion rate by 5x. This blog breaks down the
essentials to help you optimize every page while maximizing ROI on
traffic.

MISCELLANEOUS

 4 YEARS, €2M, AND A GREEN DREAM (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Grünfin, a sustainable investment platform that sought to make
values-based ETF investing accessible, has closed after four years due
to challenges in scaling and overcoming misconceptions about
sustainable investing. Despite delivering positive portfolio growth
for nearly all customers and receiving significant venture funding,
the startup struggled with market reluctance, timing, and trust
barriers, underscoring the difficulties faced by mission-driven
startups in uncertain economic climates. 

 THE ANTI-SHACKLETON MANIFESTO (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 In business today, trying to keep everything going like Shackleton
did is a bad idea. Leaders need to be good at regularly figuring out
what parts of the company aren't working and getting rid of them. They
should move fast, cut things in a smart order, and be super clear with
their team. This helps them deal with change and come out better. The
new leadership motto is to stop doing what others keep doing and grow
by ending stuff on purpose. 

 THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO NAVIGATING THE VC INVESTMENT FUNNEL (5 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 The VC investment funnel is the step-by-step way VCs find, check out,
and put money into promising startups. It has six main parts: finding
deals, picking the good ones, double checking everything, deciding to
invest, helping the startups grow, and eventually selling their part
of the company. Knowing how each step works helps startup founders
make their companies look better to investors and helps investors make
smart choices. The funnel starts with a lot of possible investments
but narrows down to just a few in the end. Out of 100 leads, about
20-30 make it to the first review step, 10-15 of those get looked at
really closely, and 5-10 end up getting money.
