HEADLINES & TRENDS

 DALTON CALDWELL EXITS YC AFTER 12 YEARS (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 After advising 1,000+ startups across 25 batches, Dalton Caldwell is
leaving YC to co-found Standard Capital - an AI-native Series A firm
with Paul Buchheit and Bryan Berg. 

 STARTUP REVENUE GROWTH RATES ARE SLOWING (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Startup growth is cooling off - Q1 2025 data from 9,000 companies
shows revenue growth dropped 3-5 percentage points, with top
performers falling 8-10 points. While Q1 typically underperforms after
Q4 highs, the real story is that growth rates have been declining
since the 2021-2022 boom when cheap capital fueled expansion. Every
sector got hit - consumer, SaaS, fintech, even AI. 

 SCALE AI ANNOUNCES NEXT PHASE OF COMPANY'S EVOLUTION (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 After the news broke over the weekend, Scale has officially announced
its next phase with Meta investing $14.3B. Scale's founder Alexandr
Wang will join Meta's AI initiatives. Chief Strategy Officer Jason
Droege will step in as Scale's Interim CEO.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW (AND WHEN) TO RAISE MONEY IF YOU'RE PRE-REVENUE (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Short answer: don't raise pre-revenue - it's usually easier to just
get paying customers first. However, if you're building hardware like
Rivian, network effects like Uber, or heavily regulated products like
Coinbase, you might actually need cash upfront. If that's you, what
works is: teams with deep industry expertise, 75k+ free users who
can't live without your product, viral social media launches, or top
accelerators writing $500k checks. Just know that getting your first
$1,000 in revenue is still probably easier than any of these
alternatives. 

 THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT SENTENCES IN SALES (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Every first sales call drives toward one moment: "I get it, and I
think we can help." You can't say "I get it" without actually learning
something - ask questions and uncover what's broken. You can't say "I
think we can help" unless you know how - recognize their pattern and
match it to past wins. It's a forcing function: learn first, promise
second. When placed right, it creates a curiosity gap where buyers
lean in because they actually want to hear what's next. 

 YOU NEED A BETTER TESTING STRATEGY (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A/B testing in tech often fails to deliver meaningful results, with
only 10% of tests tied to revenue-beating controls. Teams frequently
follow outdated practices and fail to implement successful outcomes,
wasting resources. The industry needs a shift towards data-driven
strategies and stakeholder alignment to improve testing effectiveness.

TOOLS & RESOURCES

 LYRA (TOOL) [10] 

 AI-native video conferencing that turns every call into a real-time
canvas and deal room. 

 ALL VOICE LAB (TOOL) [11] 

 All Voice Lab, built for creators and developers, provides
ultra-realistic AI voice generation and cloning with multilingual
support. 

 RAPIDMCP (TOOL) [12] 

 RapidMCP lets you convert your REST API into an AI-ready MCP server
in minutes, no code changes or backend modifications required.

MISCELLANEOUS

 IS ALL MICROMANAGEMENT BAD? (15 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The "don't micromanage" advice has created managers so scared of
hovering that they under-manage instead. Lattice's Jack Altman says
micromanagement is a powerful tool when used to model excellence or
bring attention to neglected areas. Rippling's Matt MacInnis advocates
to "go and see" when data looks weird. Stripe built review systems
with "red pen holders" who marked up anything going to 100+ users. The
key is knowing when to dive deep and when to zoom out. 

 GOOGLE AI MODE: FIRST THOUGHTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES (6 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Google's new AI Mode is actually pretty good, and that's the problem.
Users get comprehensive answers without clicking through to websites,
cutting publisher traffic by 50%+. Good news: only 1% of users
currently use it. Bad news: that won't last. Start thinking of
survival strategies, like diversifying your traffic through other
forms of media or building a brand so strong that people find you
directly. 

 FRONTIER AI LABS: THE CALL OPTION TO AGI (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 From Meta plowing $14B into Scale AI to OpenAI's 80% price drop on
its o3 model, the pace of AI development has gone parabolic. At the
foundational model layer, startups, investors, and tech giants are
going all in. For frontier AI labs to succeed, they must execute a
multi-pronged strategy: capture advertising revenue from incumbents
and build a defensible enterprise business while investing in moonshot
endeavors.
