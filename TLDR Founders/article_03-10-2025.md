 DON'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE LLM BASKET (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Customers expect your AI feature to just work - but every LLM vendor
will throw outages, model changes, and other curveballs at you. The
solution? Diversify.

OpenRouter gives you one API [4] that connects to 500+ models: GPT,
Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and more. When one provider has
issues, requests automatically route to your backup. Your users never
see an error. Add ~25ms of latency, eliminate hours of downtime.

✅ OpenAI-compatible SDK: your existing code works out of the box.

✅ Set fallback rules by price or latency [4].

✅ Bring your own API key (or let users bring theirs)

👉 Join 4.2M+ global users. Route your 1st prompt [4]

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE AI APPLICATION SPENDING REPORT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 a16z analyzed spending from 200,000 Mercury customers to see where
startups put their AI dollars - horizontal apps beat vertical ones
60/40, with creative tools dominating as the largest category, proving
AI turned design into something everyone does. Vibe coding hit
enterprise hard with Replit generating 15x more revenue than Lovable
because it builds full enterprise-grade apps beyond just UI. Nearly
70% of companies moved from consumer to business in under two years,
getting pulled into enterprises faster than any previous software era.

times and integrating with EHR and PM systems, addressing longstanding
scheduling frustrations. Assort Health's AI has improved the patient
experience, delivering 98% resolution rates and driving substantial
operational efficiencies for healthcare providers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BALANCING MULTIPLE ICPS: STRATEGIES FOR SOLO FOUNDERS (12 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Solo founders face challenges balancing multiple ideal customer
profiles (ICPs). Strategies include time-boxing efforts, creating
dedicated landing pages, and using smart classification during
registration to target specific customer groups. Marketing and
communication must be tailored for each ICP, ensuring relevant
messaging and efficient resource allocation. 

 5 INTERESTING LEARNINGS FROM FIGMA AT $1 BILLION IN ARR (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Figma reached $1 billion in ARR with 41% growth, $100M+ net income,
and 24% free cash flow margins. The company maintains strong expansion
with 1,119 customers paying over $100K ARR, driving a 129% NDR at
scale. Mid-market customers at $10K-$100K ARR offer significant growth
potential, while strategic investments in AI and new products support
future growth. 

 A 4-STEP FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING DELIGHTFUL PRODUCTS (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Nesrine Changuel emphasizes delight as a key business strategy,
advising tech leaders to integrate emotional connection into product
design. Her 4-step Delight Model includes identifying user motivators,
converting these into opportunities, using a delight grid for
solutions, and validating ideas with a checklist. This approach has
been successfully applied in projects like Google Chrome and Spotify's
Discover Weekly, illustrating the importance of balancing
functionality and delight.

MISCELLANEOUS

 REVERSE IMPOSTOR SYNDROME (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A coach noticed tech leaders who know they're excellent but work
behind closed doors, so their job titles and external signals don't
match their actual skill level. The solution isn't building confidence
but external positioning - learning to speak about your strategies and
present to leadership in ways that feel authentic. Focus on behaviors
like framing work as strategic and building business cases rather than
surface-level personal branding advice. 

 THE RAG OBITUARY: KILLED BY AGENTS, BURIED BY CONTEXT WINDOWS (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A founder built a financial search engine using the standard playbook
- break documents into chunks, turn them into vectors, search, rerank,
feed results to an AI. It took three years and constant maintenance.
Then he tried Claude Code and realized it just searched files directly
with grep, a tool from 1973, and got better results. The entire
retrieval infrastructure was solving a problem that no longer exists.
Early AI could only read 12 pages at once, so you had to find the
right fragments. Now it can read 6,000 pages, so it just reads
everything and investigates like a human would. 

 A RESEARCH THINKING TOOLKIT TO SPEED UP THE DISCOVERY PHASE (4 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Founders are shipping MVPs in minutes with AI. However, a UX
researcher who led discovery at Uber Eats says they're confusing
motion with progress. Most teams build before figuring out if they're
solving a real problem or if they're the right team to solve it. The
fix is finding problem-solution fit first - who you are as a founder,
what problem you're positioned to tackle, and whether your solution
fits into someone's life. She breaks this into three phases. Incubate
means resisting the urge to build richer ideas. Immerse means spending
a focused week with customers instead of hundreds of scattered
conversations. Integrate means being realistic about behavior change -
your product needs to be 9X better than what people already use to
overcome inertia.
