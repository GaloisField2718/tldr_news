HEADLINES & TRENDS

 GLEAN DOUBLES VALUATION TO $4.6B IN LESS THAN SEVEN MONTHS (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Glean, an AI-enhanced work assistant and enterprise search startup,
recently raised over $260 million in Series E funding at a $4.6
billion valuation, just months after a previous funding round. The
Palo Alto-based company, founded by former Google engineers, offers a
generative AI search tool that connects with enterprise applications
and databases and has introduced new features for workflow automation
and integrations with Zendesk and Salesforce Service Cloud. Glean has
seen significant growth, tripling its annual recurring revenue in the
past year. It has raised a total of $620 million since its founding in
2019. 

 THE END OF THE 1 BILLION ACTIVE USER AD-SUPPORTED STARTUP (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The tech industry may be shifting away from broadly horizontal
consumer apps like YouTube and TikTok, which have become increasingly
difficult to create and sustain due to high competition and changing
user behaviors. Instead, the next generation of successful apps may be
"vertical apps" that cater to specific niches or interests, offering
higher monetization potential through direct spending and focused
utility. These apps may prioritize solo user experiences, leveraging
game design mechanics and AI-driven productivity tools to drive
engagement and growth. 

 BUILDING VERTICAL INTEGRATORS IS HARD (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Building a ‚ÄúVertical Integrator‚Äù is an exceptionally challenging
endeavor, as illustrated by the case of Katerra, which failed despite
substantial investment and a promising strategy. The difficulties
include the need to integrate both hardware and software, compete
against strong incumbents, determine the right level of integration,
and manage high costs and complex logistics. While the path is fraught
with obstacles, successful Vertical Integrators can achieve
significant advantages and create products that are difficult to
replicate, as seen in examples like Apple and SpaceX.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 STARTUP GRADUATION RATES: WHAT DOES IT TAKE? (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Only a tiny fraction of startups, around 0.6%, successfully secure
funding beyond Series D or achieve an exit through acquisition or IPO.
Startups face increasing challenges in raising subsequent funding
rounds as they progress from seed to later stages, with key factors
like the founding team, revenue growth, gross margins, and market
conditions heavily influencing their chances of success. While the
number of new tech startups founded each year is impressive, the vast
majority either stagnate or fail to navigate the complex journey from
early-stage funding to a successful exit. 

 LEVERAGING BIZOPS TO SCALE PMF (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 BizOps is a flexible role that helps high-growth tech companies make
faster, more informed decisions by bridging the gap between
organizational structure and business objectives. As companies grow,
BizOps teams may specialize into areas like go-to-market or product,
but their core responsibility remains connecting and aligning
different parts of the organization. Measuring the success of BizOps
can be challenging, but it should be based on how well their
cross-functional partners perform on key business metrics and how
effectively the BizOps team is leveraged across the organization. 

 THE MILLION-DOLLAR SECRET I DISCOVERED ON CANNES' RED CARPET (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Two years ago, this author had the unique experience of walking the
Cannes Film Festival's red carpet as a VIP guest, thanks to winning a
Mastercard promotion with a creative video submission. Despite the
carpet's surprisingly low quality, the event highlighted a valuable
marketing lesson: the significance lies not in the product itself but
in the people who use it, demonstrating the importance of showcasing
and celebrating customers to enhance brand value.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CUMULATIVE VS. CYCLICAL KNOWLEDGE (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In the late 19th century, many doctors dismissed germ theory, leading
to inadequate medical practices that contributed to President James
Garfield's death from infection after an assassination attempt. This
historical example contrasts with the field of finance, where
fundamental issues like debt and greed have persisted over time,
highlighting how knowledge in some areas, like medicine, is cumulative
and universally accepted, while in others, like finance, it is
cyclical and influenced by human behavior. This cyclical nature of
financial knowledge implies that society must accept a degree of
volatility and repeated mistakes, as these issues are not easily
resolved by scientific truths. 

 THE ‚ÄúDEVELOPING‚Äù VC MANAGER (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The way venture capital firms are classified by limited partners
(LPs) can be overly broad and overlook significant differences between
firms. A new category, "developing managers," is proposed to describe
firms that have demonstrated early success and are on track to become
established, but are not yet at that level. By asking the right
questions and considering a firm's strategy, growth, and performance,
LPs can better understand a firm's potential and make more informed
investment decisions. 

 A SOFTWARE-DRIVEN AUTONOMY STACK IS TAKING SHAPE (8 MINUTE READ) [18]


 The presence of self-driving cars in San Francisco highlights the
significant advancements in autonomy, driven by improvements in sensor
technology, AI models, and software-hardware integration. While
companies like Waymo and Tesla are prominent, many others are
leveraging these technologies for diverse applications, such as
defense and industrial processes, leading to a decoupling of hardware
and software. The autonomy stack consists of four layers: perception,
location and mapping, planning and coordination, and controls. Ongoing
efforts are being made to develop reusable components and solve
technical challenges across industries.

 WHY PLG FAILS FOR MOST B2B BUSINESSES (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Product-led growth (PLG) is often unsuitable for most B2B businesses
as it can lead to wasted resources and false validation without
generating substantial revenue. 

 THE RARITY SHIBBOLETH (1 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Large language models are excellent at summarizing and analyzing vast
amounts of information, but they can struggle to provide unique or
rare insights, instead often providing average or typical responses.
