HEADLINES & TRENDS

 REPLIT HITS $3B VALUATION ON $150 MILLION ANNUALIZED REVENUE (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Replit has raised $250 million, achieving a $3 billion valuation with
$150 million in annualized revenue. Prysm Capital led the round with
Amex Ventures and Google's AI Futures Fund also participating
alongside existing investors. Microsoft's recent Azure integration
highlights Replit's growing popularity in the developer community. 

 BLOCKCHAIN LENDER FIGURE RAISES $787.5 MILLION IN US IPO (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Figure Technology raised $787.5 million in its IPO, valuing the
blockchain lender at $5.29 billion. The company sold 31.5 million
shares at $25 each, higher than its initial range, and will trade on
Nasdaq under "FIGR." Figure specializes in blockchain-based home
equity loans with faster processing times. 

 KLARNA SHARES RISE 15% IN THEIR FIRST DAY OF TRADING ON WALL STREET
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Klarna's shares surged 15% on its NYSE debut, opening at $52 and
closing at $45.82. The IPO raised $1.37 billion, marking it the
largest of 2025. Klarna targets U.S. growth, rivaling credit cards
with its "pay-in-4" plan as regulatory scrutiny of buy-now-pay-later
services increases.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW AI IS REWRITING INBOUND CONVERSION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Inbound conversion used to mean SDRs racing to respond within
minutes, but AI agents are proving to be the perfect use case - they
qualify instantly, respond 24/7, and buyers actually prefer them to
pushy salespeople. Rho cut cost-per-meeting from $570 to $45,
Demandbase booked 4x more meetings, and Hubspot's PLG motion finally
converted browsers into buyers - all by replacing human SDRs with AI
agents. 

 $-IMPACT OF ZERO-WASTE GTM (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Zero-Waste GTM means eliminating all non-essential work from your
go-to-market teams using AI, and some companies are claiming 90%
revenue lifts without adding headcount - here's how the math actually
works. When AI handles the 70% of tasks that aren't selling (data
entry, follow-ups, and research), your best reps can take on twice as
many deals, and here's where it gets interesting: those top performers
close 10% better, get 10% higher prices, and move 10% faster -
multiply those together and you get 1.1 x 1.1 x 1.1 = roughly 1.33x
improvement per deal, times twice the deals, which equals nearly
double the revenue. 

 OPENAI'S HEAD OF PRODUCT REVEALS THE 15 AI DISTRIBUTION PLAYS THAT
BUILD REAL MOATS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Distribution determines survival in AI because features replicate in
weeks while distribution compounds over years - Perplexity won through
shareable outputs, Clay invented the job category "GTM Engineer," and
Cluely turned outrage into free marketing. The framework splits into
three paths that actually work: bundling into existing platforms where
users already live, embedding invisibly at the moment of workflow
intent, or creating unfair advantages competitors won't copy like
provocative narratives. The 15 tactics range from designing outputs
people want to share to pricing that grows revenue faster than costs -
master three to five of these, and you will survive when GPT-5 makes
everyone's features identical overnight.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW TO BUILD MENTAL STRENGTH (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Clear thinking requires four strengths that most people lack:
self-accountability (taking responsibility instead of making excuses),
self-knowledge (knowing where you're actually competent versus where
you're just confident), self-control (managing impulses so you're not
sabotaging your long-term goals), and self-confidence (the balance
between earned competence and aspiration). These aren't abstract
ideals, but muscles you train daily. Positive habits become automatic
defaults that compound over time, while the right role models show you
what's possible without you needing to compete with them directly. 

 BUILD PLACES, NOT PRODUCTS (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Software design is beginning to look like conference rooms under
fluorescent lights - functional but soulless - because teams optimize
for efficiency over atmosphere. When AI can generate competent
interfaces in seconds, one defensible position is creating an
atmosphere that makes people choose your product, not because it works
(everything works), but because it feels like somewhere they want to
be. 

 WHY LANGUAGE MODELS HALLUCINATE (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 OpenAI has published a paper explaining why AI models make up facts.
It comes down to how we test them - models get points for guessing
right but zero for saying "I don't know," so they learn to confidently
invent answers rather than admit uncertainty. If a model doesn't know
your birthday and guesses "September 10," it has a 1-in-365 chance of
scoring, but admitting ignorance guarantees failure, which trains even
advanced models like GPT-5 to hallucinate rather than be honest.
