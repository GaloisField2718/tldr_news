 FORECASTING IN UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Forecasting in the B2B software industry is becoming increasingly
challenging due to factors such as sales volatility, pricing pressure,
and the shift towards usage-based pricing models. Companies are facing
issues with customer collectability, particularly with smaller and
riskier customers, leading to increased write-offs and a need for more
proactive credit checks. Effective forecasting in this volatile market
requires a deep understanding of the business, engagement from
founders, and the use of AI to enhance efficiency and model
capabilities.

MINUTE READ) [8]

supportive culture that fosters long-term success. Examples like
Airbnb and Concur demonstrate how a strong culture can enhance
employee collaboration, customer empathy, and overall organizational
growth.
