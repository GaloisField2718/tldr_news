 THE SECRET TO AI FEATURE ADOPTION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Is no one adopting your AI product/features?

AI companies are struggling to find product-market-fit.

Good prompts and different LLMs aren't enough to building
production-ready AI features.

Companies are now racing to build integrations [4] to equip their LLMs
with customer-specific contextual data [4] and seamlessly integrate
into their customers' workflows.

That's why Copy.ai, Tavus, Writesonic and other leading AI SaaS
companies rely on Paragon [4] so they can ship these integrations 7x
faster.

 Kyle Vogt, the co-founder and former CEO of Cruise, has launched a
new venture, the Bot Company, aimed at developing robots to perform
household chores. It has secured $150 million in funding from notable
investors, including Nat Friedman and the Collison brothers. This move
marks Vogt's return to the tech scene following his departure from
Cruise amidst regulatory challenges after a Cruise vehicle was
involved in a serious accident. 

 SOCIAL CAPITAL'S 2023 ANNUAL LETTER (14 MINUTE READ) [6]

2011. Highlighting 2023's economic trends, he notes the end of cheap
capital and AI's impact on company building, giving advice on
product-market fit and capital allocation. He also explores rate
hikes, a banking crisis, and generative AI's rapid growth. 

 VENTURE STUDIOS AND INCUBATIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Venture studios are emerging as a popular model for early-stage
investments, focusing on building, launching, and funding startups
with a systematic approach to reduce risk and increase success rates.
Unlike traditional venture capital or accelerators, venture studios

resources, and expertise to help startups grow from inception to
market.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 10 YEARS AFTER GROWTH HACKING (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Growth hacking techniques have become widely adopted across the tech
industry over the past decade, but their effectiveness has been
limited by factors such as the maturation of mobile platforms and the
difficulty of achieving product-market fit through A/B testing alone.
As new AI technologies emerge, growth strategies are evolving to
leverage the power of personalized content creation and engagement,
opening up new opportunities for startups to drive rapid adoption and
growth. 

 5-STEP FRAMEWORK TO UNCOVER GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES (11 MINUTE READ) [9]


 This article presents a 5-step framework to uncover growth
opportunities that involves regularly revisiting product flows,
understanding user journeys, empathizing with user emotions,
leveraging behavioral principles, connecting problems with hypotheses
and predictions, and identifying key success metrics. This approach
helps align business thinking with user-centricity, leading to
meaningful product improvements. 

 HOW TO CALCULATE NET DOLLAR RETENTION (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Net Dollar Retention (NDR) is a measure of how much your existing
customers expand in a given period, net of any churn or down-sell. It
combines all your existing customer data and is arguably the best
indicator of your business's health. You can impact NDR by selling
more of the same product, introducing a new product, or reducing
churn. Generally, anything over 110% is good, and anything over 130%
is great.

 ARE REVENUE MULTIPLES A THING OF THE PAST? (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Private equity firms have shifted their valuation approach for SaaS
companies from revenue-based to future EBITDA-based, influencing
venture capitalists to follow suit. This change emphasizes the
importance of demonstrating future cash flow potential, efficient
capital use, and competitive processes to maximize company valuations
at various stages of fundraising or sale. 

 THE BIG TARIFFS ARE HERE (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The United States is imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese-made electric
vehicles, which will effectively keep them out of the American market.
The tariffs may not significantly impact consumers, since few Chinese
EVs are currently sold in the U.S. They are part of a broader shift
towards protectionism in American trade policy, driven by concerns
about jobs, trade imbalances, cybersecurity risks, and maintaining
domestic manufacturing capacity for defense purposes. 

 THE 10 DEADLY SINS OF B2B GROWTH (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 To achieve sustained growth, B2B companies must avoid common pitfalls
such as neglecting user feedback, prioritizing growth over
product-market fit, and ignoring usage retention, as these oversights
can hinder long-term success. By recognizing and addressing these
mistakes, companies can focus on building effective growth systems and
methods that amplify their efforts and lead to repeatable and
predictable impacts.

 SELF-MASTERY: THE FOUR AGREEMENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [18]

2024.
