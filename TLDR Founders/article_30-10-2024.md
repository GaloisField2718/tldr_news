HEADLINES & TRENDS

 INFINITY MISSIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 "Infinity Missions" are endeavors where the stakes are either
infinite upside or infinite downside, fundamentally altering
traditional cost-benefit analysis. Historically, governments have
funded missions to prevent existential threats, like the Manhattan
Project and the Space Race. Today, private companies are pursuing
infinite upside opportunities, such as the race for AGI. These
missions attract top talent, justify massive investments, and often
lead to groundbreaking technological advancements that benefit
humanity. 

 MISALIGNED INCENTIVES (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In the VC landscape, incentives between general partners (GPs) and
founders are increasingly misaligned. While GPs once focused on
maximizing carried interest (20% of profits), the growing size of
funds has shifted their focus to management fees (2% annually),
leading to a deployment-driven approach that may not align with
founders' long-term success. This shift can result in overfunding
early-stage companies and a more transactional relationship where GPs
are less invested in the success of individual companies, especially
during challenging times. 

 WHY BUILDING IN AI IS NOTHING LIKE MAKING CONVENTIONAL SOFTWARE (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Building AI products requires a different approach than traditional
software development due to unique challenges in feasibility and
value. While traditional software often focuses on value and viability
risks, AI projects must also address significant feasibility risks, as
AI models can produce unpredictable results. Successful AI development
requires continuous testing, iteration, and a deep understanding of
the model's capabilities to ensure reliable and valuable outcomes.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SCRAPE YOUR WAY IN: HOW SENJA USES AI TO BOOST B2B ONBOARDING (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Senja, a B2B tool for managing customer testimonials, improved its
onboarding process by using AI to scrape testimonials from users'
websites. This automated feature allows users to quickly experience
the platform's value without the burden of manually uploading data,
leading to a faster "Aha! Moment" and reducing onboarding friction.
The strategy highlights how AI can streamline B2B onboarding by
simplifying data integration and reducing user effort. 

 FAKE IT WHILE YOU MAKE IT: USING AI SIMULATIONS FOR A STRONGER SALES
PLAYBOOK (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sales teams can simulate and refine their pitches by running AI tools
like ChatGPT through realistic scenarios. This approach allows for the
identification of weak spots in messaging, such as jargon-heavy
phrases or awkward transitions, and provides actionable feedback to
improve resilience against skeptical audiences. By using AI-generated
insights and tailored discovery questions, sales reps can create more
engaging and effective conversations, leading to a polished and
adaptable pitch strategy in a fraction of the usual time. 

 HOW VCS EVALUATE STARTUPS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Understand VC priorities to sharpen your pitch and ensure you
highlight what matters most. VCs evaluate startups based on several
key criteria, including the strength and cohesion of the founding
team, the size and growth potential of the market, and the competitive
landscape. They assess how a startup differentiates itself from
competitors through unique value propositions or proprietary
technology, as well as its financial metrics like revenue growth and
customer acquisition costs. VCs also consider the startup's exit
potential, looking at possible acquisition opportunities or IPO
prospects to ensure a path to financial returns.

MISCELLANEOUS

 REASSESSING INCUMBENT DATA GRAVITY IN AI (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The concept of "data gravity" is central to AI value creation.
Companies with vast amounts of data, such as Salesforce and Palantir,
can leverage data gravity to build powerful AI-driven applications.
Open table formats like Iceberg are breaking down traditional data
silos, allowing companies to store and access data more flexibly,
while software giants like Databricks, Salesforce, and UiPath are
competing to become the leading platforms for AI workloads by
integrating and unifying enterprise data. Despite the dominance of
incumbents, the evolving landscape of open data formats is gradually
reducing lock-in effects. 

 ARE BOARD OBSERVERS A GOOD IDEA FOR A STARTUP? (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Board observers have become increasingly common in startup
governance, particularly in venture capital-backed companies. They
provide expertise, diverse perspectives, and networking opportunities
without formal voting power. While board observers can offer valuable
insights and serve as a stepping stone for emerging leaders, their
presence may also lead to confidentiality concerns, potential
over-influence, and unclear roles, which can complicate
decision-making. Startups must weigh these pros and cons carefully to
determine if the inclusion of board observers aligns with their
strategic goals. 

 SOLOMON'S PARADOX (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 People often find it easier to solve others' problems than their own
due to Solomon's Paradox, where we think more objectively and wisely
about others' issues. This concept can be applied in business by
helping customers overcome decision-making hurdles through strategies
like offering free trials, using tools that provide an external
perspective, and addressing objections directly. By reducing emotional
bias and overthinking, businesses can enhance customer confidence and
increase sales.
