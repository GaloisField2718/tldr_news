HEADLINES & TRENDS

 STARTUPS CAN GET A MAJOR TAX BREAK THROUGH QSBS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) offers U.S. startup founders
and early employees significant tax savings on exits, potentially
avoiding federal taxes entirely on capital gains. The key requirements
include being a U.S.-based C-corp, having less than $50M in assets
when shares are issued, and holding shares for 5+ years. Act quickly
as some filings must be done within 30 days of share purchase. 

 THE DOMAIN EXPERT REVOLUTION (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 2025 marks a turning point where non-technical industry experts can
build successful startups more easily than ever. Three key shifts
enable this: AI becoming domain-specific, dramatically lower costs to
test ideas ($15K vs $250K previously), and democratized distribution
channels. Deep industry knowledge has become more valuable than
technical skills for founding successful companies. 

 WHAT HAPPENS IF TIKTOK GOES DARK (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 With TikTok facing a potential shutdown by January 19, creators are
migrating to alternatives like RedNote and Lemon8. However, these
Chinese-owned apps could face similar regulatory scrutiny. The ban
puts VCs in a difficult position regarding their ByteDance shares,
while creators who relied on TikTok's monetization face uncertain
futures. Instagram's Reels stands to gain significant market share if
TikTok exits.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT TO DO WHEN A COMPETITOR LIES (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In B2B tech, competitors often find it easier to falsely claim
capabilities than build them. This article outlines three proven
strategies: emphasizing measurable business value over feature lists,
educating customers about technical implementation differences, and
leveraging concrete proof points. It presents case studies to show how
companies successfully exposed competitor misrepresentations,
including one where a platform vendor demonstrated true integration
capabilities to counter competitors' loose "platform" claims. 

 IS YOUR RETENTION "TOO GOOD”? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 High retention in B2C subscriptions may indicate overly narrow
audience targeting, limiting potential revenue growth. Some early
churn suggests experimenting with broader audiences, leading to
long-term growth opportunities. Identifying and elevating your "cohort
floor" stabilizes churn, enhancing profitability by retaining
customers once acquisition costs are covered. 

 HOW TO MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IDEA GO VIRAL INSIDE YOUR COMPANY: LESSONS
FROM FIGMA SLIDES (20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Figma Slides, launched in beta at Config 2024, emerged from a
grassroots initiative spurred by users repurposing Figma's design tool
for presentations. Mihika Kapoor, the founding PM, leveraged internal
enthusiasm with strategic storytelling, viral moments, and innovative
pitches to win executive backing and push the product forward. Her
approach, including using humor and creating internal buzz, turned
skeptics into advocates, demonstrating the power of vision-driven and
engaging product development.

MINUTE READ) [13]

Pension System) has a 20+ year history of investing in private market

 SIX CHARTS ABOUT AI REVENUE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 An analysis of early AI revenue trends reveals impressive growth and
retention metrics across major players. ChatGPT and Anthropic show
strong retention rates of around 70-75%, while OpenAI dominates with
62.5% of consumer AI spending. The piece also highlights the rise of
"AI Native" companies, with 28 startups already reaching $25M+ in
revenue, suggesting rapid market maturation. 

 SHOCKLEY SEMICONDUCTOR LABORATORY (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 William Shockley was a brilliant but controversial figure in
semiconductor history, contributing to the invention of the junction
transistor and founding Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in Silicon
Valley. Despite his technical genius, his abrasive management style
led to the departure of key staff, known as the "traitorous eight,"
who went on to establish Fairchild Semiconductor. Shockley's legacy is
a mix of innovation and dysfunction, ultimately paving the way for
Silicon Valley's tech revolution.
