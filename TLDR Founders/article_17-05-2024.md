HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE BUSINESS CASE FOR LONGEVITY (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Extending human health and life span has the potential to
significantly increase returns across many industries by keeping
customers alive and healthy for longer periods. Investing in longevity
research and treatments could not only save trillions in healthcare
costs but also create immense economic value by expanding future
markets in various sectors such as education, travel, health, and
entertainment. 

 SHIFTING POWER DYNAMICS IN THE AI-FOCUSED CLOUD (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The AI-driven cloud landscape is undergoing significant changes, with
NVIDIA emerging as a key player alongside AWS, Microsoft Azure, and
Google Cloud. Startups are finding opportunities by partnering with
these giants, particularly in areas like infrastructure, tooling, and
application layers, while focusing on vertical and horizontal
applications, security, code generation, and robotics. The changing
dynamics indicate that startups should strategically position
themselves higher in the AI stack to create lasting value and take
advantage of the resources and partnerships provided by major cloud
providers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW ATTIO GROWS: THE PLAYBOOK FOR DISRUPTING A $280B GIANT (12 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Attio is a powerful and flexible CRM platform that aims to challenge
Salesforce by providing an intuitive user experience and a robust data
model. By focusing on product-led growth strategies and leveraging
flywheels like multiplayer collaboration, billboarding, and
community-generated content, Attio is well-positioned to carve out a
valuable slice of the CRM market. 

 HOW TO MAKE YOUR APP A HABIT (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The more attention of a user you can acquire, the more value you can
extract. Tools like push notifications and email can help maintain
visibility and relevance. However, you will never truly retain
someone's engagement unless you make using your product a part of
their daily routine. This is an excerpt from an interview with Lenny
Rachitsky, the author and creator of Lenny's Newsletter and former
Product Lead at Airbnb, where he discusses how to make the use of your
app a habit for users. 

 BLINDED BY METRICS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Financial metrics can be easily misused or misunderstood, leading to
dangerous consequences for companies and investors. It's crucial for
leaders and investors to truly grasp the meaning behind these metrics
and how they should guide decision-making, as relying on misleading
metrics can conceal problems that require immediate attention and
resolution.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DOES EMAIL RESPONSIVENESS CORRELATE WITH FOUNDER SUCCESS? (3 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Eric Schmidt, Sam Altman, and Jason Lemkin all have something in
common: they believe that the best founders respond to important
emails quickly, no matter what. They even have data to prove it. But
why is that? Well, they argue that building startups involves making a
series of rapid decisions. The faster you make decisions, the more
useful data you accumulate, giving you something to react to and
ultimately leading to better decision-making. 

 DELEGATING IS EASIER WHEN YOU GET BETTER AT EXPLAINING YOUR IDEAS (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Effective communication in project management involves covering five
key areas: ensuring understanding, generating enthusiasm, mitigating
risks, confirming alignment, and establishing a feedback loop. By
addressing these aspects, managers can set their team members up for
success, foster a collaborative environment, and ultimately achieve
better project outcomes. 

 THE MYTH OF BEING "SURROUNDED BY IDIOTS" (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 We've all felt like the smartest person in the room, surrounded by
idiots. However, this "critic mindset" isn't a sign of superiority -
it's a trap that can lead to misery and destruction. Learn to
appreciate the art of enjoyment, even as you hone your critical
thinking. Sincere attachment isn't naivete - it's a form of
intelligence we desperately need.

 IN STARTUPS, YOU NEED WINTER ANIMALS, NOT SUMMER ANIMALS (2 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 It's important to build a resilient team of "winter animals" who have
the grit and determination to persevere through challenging times,
rather than "summer animals" who may jump ship when things get tough. 

 ARE AI COMPANIES VALUED DIFFERENTLY THAN NON-AI COMPANIES? (1 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 While AI companies command a premium, investors still view them as
software companies, despite the advanced technology powering their
operations. 

 SALES CYCLES ARE EVEN LONGER IN 2024 (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Despite some sectors like AI and security performing well, the
majority of B2B SaaS companies are still facing challenges and have
not yet seen a bounce back to easier times.
