 Several companies that went public through SPAC mergers have
experienced significant declines in their valuations and share prices,
leading some, including 23andMe, to transition back to private
ownership in an attempt to recover outside the public market's
scrutiny. This trend reflects the challenges faced by companies
post-IPO, especially those that debuted during the SPAC boom, as they
navigate financial difficulties and seek to capitalize on potential
upsides away from the public eye.

utility to succeed in the long run.
