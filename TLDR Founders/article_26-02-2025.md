HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHAT HAPPENED TO MY TRAFFIC? (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Chegg sued Google after losing millions of visitors to the new AI
Overviews feature, which seems to deliver Chegg-like homework answers
right on Google. Traffic dropped 34%, sparking the first lawsuit of
its kind. Others are feeling the impact, too—Stack Overflow and
HubSpot also saw steep dips, while The New York Times thrived,
possibly thanks to a lucrative licensing deal. It's a sign that
AI-driven search may transform how users discover content, and
companies without special partnerships could watch their traffic fade.


 VENTURE PSYCHOLOGY (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Early-stage investing is more about the founder's grit than fancy
projections. Investors look for relentless, problem-obsessed
individuals who will pivot, iterate, and outwork everyone else.
History shows that markets shift, products evolve, and competition
pops up—what truly matters is whether the founder will quit or not.
That unstoppable mindset, plus a willingness to adapt, often outweighs
even the best-drafted business plan or pitch deck. 

 EARLY STAGE BRAND DESIGN (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Don't overinvest in visual rebranding - focus on product and market
fit instead. Early-stage startups should aim for a "good enough" brand
design and avoid expensive and lengthy design projects. The key is
building something that solves a problem and that people want.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MISTAKES IN DUE DILIGENCE THAT KILL DEALS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Loads of founders think a term sheet is the hard part—until
investors start combing through the numbers. Sloppy financials,
mismatched growth metrics, or a chaotic cap table can scare off
potential backers. Failure to address legal snags, compliance issues,
or fuzzy IP rights also sinks deals fast. Getting everything
buttoned-up and transparent is often the difference between a
successful close and a last-minute collapse. 

 AN OPERATOR'S GUIDE TO PRODUCT STRATEGY (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Two complementary layers shape a great product roadmap: a near-term
“small S” strategy to fix current issues, and a longer-term “big
S” vision that imagines the product's future three to ten years out.
Collecting user data, brainstorming, and building quick prototypes
helps teams converge on realistic plans for now and aspirational plans
for later. The key is to force disciplined choices about where you'll
focus finite resources—and designing with both immediate and
eventual goals in mind. 

 "STEALTH MODE" AND OTHER F'ING BRILLIANT STRATEGIES (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Keep your startup in stealth mode to avoid early competition and
distractions. Focus on perfecting your product before launch and don't
worry about customer validation. Concentrate on coding and raising
funds early while benchmarking against competitors without fearing
differentiation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FIVE EMERGING VC SWIMLANES (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The venture market is fracturing into distinct tiers: tiny pre-seed
funds, inception-stage firms, new Series A specialists, mid-sized
“too big but not big enough” players, and supersized
billion-dollar platforms. Each swimlane has different fund sizes, risk
appetites, and target exit multiples. Founders need to know which lane
their potential investors occupy so they can raise capital from
partners whose portfolio strategy—and check size—truly aligns with
their startup's stage and ambitions. 

 THE IMPACT OF FOUNDER PERSONALITIES ON STARTUP SUCCESS (48 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Research shows that startup founders' personality traits
significantly impact their ventures' success. Specific Big Five traits
like adventurousness and openness are more common in successful
founders. Startups with diverse personality types among their founding
teams have higher chances of success. 

 IS GROWTH STILL GOOD? (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI companies are reaching $40-80M in revenue faster than ever, with
startups like Harvey hitting $50M ARR in just three years. However,
rapid growth may actually signal vulnerability - without network
effects or unique tech advantages, these companies are often finding
"shallow gold" that competitors can easily replicate. Metrics that
used to prove success now raise questions about defensibility in a
market flooded with corporate innovation budgets.

couch—or it can be mature and long-term, taking into account the
future and a wider circle of people.
