HEADLINES & TRENDS

 RESTRICTION ON ENTRY OF CERTAIN NONIMMIGRANT WORKERS (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 A new proclamation blocks most foreign tech workers from entering the
US on H-1B visas unless their employers pay a $100,000 surcharge per
petition. The move responds to claims that companies have replaced
Americans with cheaper labor, often forcing laid-off staff to train
their replacements. Exceptions exist for “national interest”
cases, but the order raises labor costs sharply and signals a push to
reserve entry-level IT jobs for domestic graduates. 

 NAVAN FILES TO IPO (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Navan is heading to the public markets with $688M ARR, 30% growth,
and gross margins up to 73% after major AI-driven efficiency gains.
Still, net revenue retention barely clears 110%, free cash flow
margins sit at -5%, and its Rule of 40 score is just 25%, near the
bottom quartile. Investors will judge whether margin progress and
AI-powered support can offset middling growth and a lower-revenue
scale compared to top SaaS peers. 

 WHAT ROBOTS CAN (AND CAN'T) DO IN 2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Robots still struggle with tasks like picking up objects due to the
challenges in machine perception and manipulation. Achieving
breakthroughs akin to a "ChatGPT moment" in robotics requires blending
advanced AI models with traditional engineering. The future of
robotics depends on combining simulation data with real-world
applications to overcome current limitations.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO GET CITED IN AI ANSWERS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Did you know AI models cite brands mentioned at industry conferences?
This SEO expert discovered it after ChatGPT kept recommending his
competitors despite his better domain authority and more backlinks.
Turns out LLMs scan transcribed conference talks, YouTube
presentations, and LinkedIn recaps - places his competitors were
getting namedropped while he bought Reddit mentions. The models also
track user corrections. A pizza shop vanished from AI suggestions
after enough people typed "don't show me that again" in follow-up
prompts. His competitors weren't trying to game AI at all. They were
presenting case studies at conferences, getting discussed in customer
Slack channels, and showing up in YouTube tutorials. These mentions
trained the AI to trust them. 

 CLUELY THESIS ON VIRALITY AND HYPE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Viral content will spread if it's seen by a large enough audience and
deserves attention. The true value of going viral lies in gaining user
interest, especially post-PMF, rather than driving immediate
conversions. 

 HOW TO FIND THE PERFECT NAME (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 David Placek and his team at Lexicon Branding have named nearly 4,000
brands, including Swiffer, Sonos, and Pentium, by using a structured
naming process. In today's competitive and AI-driven market, an
effective name can create trust, communicate originality, and be
globally accessible. The Lexicon Framework advises generating
thousands of names, considering sound symbolism, and emphasizing trust
and uniqueness over descriptiveness.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE SELF IS THE PLATFORM (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI has inverted the fundamental equation of technology - individuals
can now rival entire teams, and private tools are beating public
platforms. One person with ChatGPT and Cursor can ship what used to
require 50 people. The last tech boom was about coordinating people at
scale, but AI flipped it - personal leverage beats social leverage
now. These aren't social networks, they're supertools that multiply
individual capacity without needing anyone else. The individual is now
the base unit of scale. 

 HOW TO USE AI WITHOUT BECOMING STUPID (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 We trust AI to draft emails, schedule calls, even write code, but the
real danger isn't mistakes — it's letting it choose for us. A simple
rule has quietly emerged across classrooms, trading desks, and dev
teams: never give up your value judgments. The paradox is that
automation works best when it leaves humans more room to decide. 

 THE IPO MARKET IS OPENING UP. THESE 14 COMPANIES COULD BE NEXT (12
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Crunchbase's predictive tools spotlight 14 companies across sectors
like fintech, AI, and consumer goods as probable IPO candidates.
Notables include Stripe, with its $91.5 billion valuation, and
Databricks, which raised a $10 billion round in 2024. Emerging sectors
like cybersecurity and space tech spotlight firms like Ledger, likely
to IPO due to its crypto-wallet prominence, and Sierra Space, backed
by $3.4 billion in contracts.
