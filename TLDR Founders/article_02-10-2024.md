 MARKETING IN 2024 IS AN UPHILL BATTLE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your marketing needs to scale in order for your business to grow. And
in 2024, that's harder than ever. Resources are stretched. Targets
keep increasing. Strategic initiatives are held to your marketing
department's pace.

Most agencies don't know how to scale your startup [4] from Seed to
Series A, B, C, and IPO. Bordeaux & Burgundy [4] increase your SaaS
demand generation campaign input by +200%. Cheaper than hiring
internally, faster than your current output, a process-driven full

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE VC TIDE HAS GONE OUT. A REAL INNOVATION WAVE IS NOW ARRIVING (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 After a prolonged period of easy money and inflated valuations, the
venture capital bubble is slowly deflating, making it harder for
founders to secure funding. This downturn coincides with the emergence
of large language models, a groundbreaking technology that is
transforming the way knowledge work is done and creating new
opportunities for entrepreneurs. As the market adjusts to this new
reality, founders who can adapt and find ways to stay relevant will be
well-positioned to capitalize on the coming wave of innovation. 

 THE HARD THINGS ABOUT BUILDING EMBEDDED FINTECH PRODUCTS (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Despite the potential for embedded financial services to
revolutionize various industries, many companies struggle to
capitalize on this opportunity due to the complexity and challenges
involved. Building a successful fintech product requires a deep
understanding of financial services, new metrics and KPIs, and a
willingness to take risks, all while maintaining focus on the core
business. Companies must navigate these challenges to create
customized financial products that solve specific problems and provide
unique value to their customers. 

 OPENAI'S DEVDAY BRINGS REALTIME API AND OTHER TREATS FOR DEVELOPERS
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI introduced new tools at its 2024 DevDay, including a public
beta of its Realtime API for low-latency, AI-generated voice
responses. It also significantly reduced API costs. Despite recent
departures by executives, the company remains focused on innovation,
offering features like vision fine-tuning and model distillation to
enhance developer capabilities. It faces stiff competition from
companies like Meta and Google.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO BE STRATEGIC (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Strategic work isn't about making the rare, big decisions like
launching Amazon Prime. It's about the thousands of smaller, faster
decisions that come afterward ‚Äî like how to get people to sign up or
which suppliers to onboard. Master these decisions by improving your
intuition, generating insights, and synthesizing what you've learned
into clear recommendations. Speed matters just as much as accuracy.
The real strategic edge comes from learning how to optimize
decision-making velocity. 

 HOW SAVVYCAL IS WINNING OVER CALENDLY USERS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SavvyCal attracts customers from competitors by offering to credit
the value of a competitor's unused subscription toward a new annual
plan. This bold approach lowers the cost and risk of switching for
users, making it more appealing to try a new product. However, it can
be costly and may not guarantee customer retention. Similar strategies
are used by companies like Gorgias and Clio, which offer free access
or discounts to entice users from competitors. 

 ULTIMATE MARKETING GUIDE FOR DTC STARTUPS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In order to succeed in e-commerce during the holiday season,
businesses need to create a strong marketing plan that focuses on
building brand awareness before the shopping season and driving
conversions during it. This includes running awareness ads and
optimizing for top-of-funnel goals in the months leading up to the
holiday season. When the season arrives, the focus should shift to
retargeting and sales campaigns. By using strategies such as video
content, mobile optimization, and limited-time offers, businesses can
stand out in a competitive market and make the most of their
advertising budget.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE MESSY MIDDLE: WHY SELLING MID-TIER SAAS IS TOUGH RIGHT NOW (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Mid-tier software deals, typically valued between $50,000 and
$100,000, are facing significant challenges as companies look to cut
budgets. This is because these deals often require less scrutiny and
can be easily canceled, unlike larger enterprise deals that involve
more stakeholders and complex implementations. As a result, companies
are consolidating their software tools and opting for bundled
solutions from a single vendor, leading to a decline in demand for
mid-tier software deals. 

 WHAT COUNTS AS ARR? (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 When determining Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), companies must
consider several factors, including the frequency of billing, the
source of revenue, the timing of when to start and stop counting a
customer, and any adjustments such as discounts or credits. Recurring
revenue from usage-based pricing models, such as those used in AI and
hybrid SaaS companies, should be included in ARR calculations, even if
the predictability of customer usage varies. It's also important to
distinguish between product and service-based charges, as they have
different margin structures and valuation premiums. 

 WORK-LIFE BALANCE, INTEGRATION, OR PRIORITIZATION? (4 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Embracing authenticity in both your personal and professional life is
crucial for achieving true fulfillment. When individuals' core values
and motives align with their work environment, they can experience a
sense of belonging, rather than just fitting in. By prioritizing
self-reflection, integrating work and life, and being open about one's
true identity, individuals can cultivate a more balanced and authentic
existence.
