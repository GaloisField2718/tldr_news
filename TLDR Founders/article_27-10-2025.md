STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TURNING FIRST MEETINGS INTO REAL PIPELINE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 If first calls aren't turning into deals, don't just push for more
meetings – figure out why. Start by collecting data: run call
transcripts through an LLM or have reps record structured feedback.
Are you talking to the right companies, the right buyers, and saying
the right things? Then tighten stage definitions so “qualified”
means the same thing to everyone. Use a scorecard to rate each call on
discovery, pain, and next steps to see where reps fall short. From
there, build training around the patterns, role-play for storytelling,
ICP refinement for targeting, and coach on urgency when deals stall.
Fix the system before you add volume. Clear criteria and consistent
coaching turns activity into actual pipeline. 

 HOW THIS STARTUP FOUND PRODUCT-MARKET FIT IN FINTECH (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Casca shows how product-market fit happens when startups move from
guessing to learning directly from customers. The team embedded inside
banks, observing how lenders worked and solving problems as they
appeared, instead of relying on assumptions or slide decks. That focus
turned slow, manual loan approvals into an automated process that
banks now depend on. The lesson is clear: PMF is rarely a perfect
product or vision. It comes from sitting close enough to customers to
feel their pain, building something that fixes it, and repeating the
cycle until demand pulls you forward. 

 WHY PITCHES FAIL (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most startup pitches miss because founders try to explain too much.
They know every corner of the business and assume investors need to,
too. In ten minutes, that turns into a firehose of slides, acronyms,
and backstory. However, a pitch is less about teaching and more about
sparking interest. Investors don't need to understand everything, they
just need to care enough to ask for another meeting. The best decks
keep it simple: one clear problem, one sharp solution, a few proof
points, and a story that makes sense.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A VERY OBVIOUS DEAL (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Software pricing runs on psychology as much as math. Slack's promise
to charge only for active users made people expect fairness tied to
usage, and that mindset spread across SaaS. Once buyers learned to ask
what something costs to run instead of what it's worth to them, value
became harder to defend. That's dbt's problem: it powers data teams
but doesn't handle the “expensive” part like storage or compute,
so it looks easy to underprice. Fivetran brings scale and alignment,
but not a fix to that perception. The merger matters less as a product
move and more as a lesson in how pricing shapes who captures value in
the modern data stack. 

 THE DIVINE LEVER (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Why do well-meaning founders struggle to focus on customers? Perhaps
it's philosophical. Most founders operate from self: our goals, our
vision, our version of progress. This author's answer is the divine
lever: a pursuit that is purely good, rooted entirely in serving
demand. When you find that lever, effort feels effortless because it
pulls you instead of draining you. 

 POWER TOOLS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Every craft has a tool powerful enough to both create and destroy. In
woodworking, it's the table saw. In software, it's the IDE. Mastering
them takes patience, planning, and respect. The same rule applies to
design and AI tools today: no-code and generators let anyone build
fast, but speed without understanding leads to fragile results.
They're great for sketches, not for structures meant to last. Knowing
when to reach for power and when to work by hand is what separates
craft from chaos.
