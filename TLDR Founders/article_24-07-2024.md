HEADLINES & TRENDS

 WHY THE DEMOCRATS LOST TECH (31 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tech leaders are increasingly supporting Donald Trump, marking a
significant shift from the industry's historically Democratic
leanings. This change stems from a perceived disconnect between tech's
capitalist ideals and the Democrats' focus on wealth redistribution
and regulation, particularly in areas like crypto and AI. To win back
tech, Democrats need to embrace innovation, reduce regulatory
barriers, and foster a collaborative relationship with tech
entrepreneurs. 

 CONFRONTING IMPOSSIBLE FUTURES (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI is likely to continue advancing rapidly in the coming years,
potentially reaching human-level performance across a wide range of
tasks. While there is uncertainty about the exact timeline and whether
artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be achieved, organizations
should plan for multiple possible futures involving AI disruption.
Engaging in scenario planning exercises can help prepare for the
significant changes that AI may bring to work and daily life. 

 12 KILLER WEDGES FOR YOUR COMPANY'S GROWTH (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Startups aiming to tackle large markets should begin by focusing on a
strategic niche or "killer wedge" that allows for rapid customer
acquisition and product refinement. This approach enables startups to
gather high-quality data and insights that inform their long-term
strategy and go-to-market approach. However, it's crucial for startups
to remember that a killer wedge is a stepping stone, not the final
destination, and they must adapt and expand beyond their initial niche
to achieve significant growth and success.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ZERO COMMISSION SALES IN PLG?! (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mercury has an unconventional approach of using zero-commission sales
compensation in a product-led growth (PLG) context. The potential
benefits of this model include better alignment with long-term goals,
a focus on customer value, and the development of a collaborative
culture. This approach could be particularly effective for PLG
companies, especially in the early stages or during significant
go-to-market shifts. The article outlines implementation strategies
and potential challenges. 

 THE JOURNEY FROM PERPETUAL LICENSING TO SAAS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The shift from perpetual license software models to
software-as-a-service (SaaS) models is a challenging but often
rewarding transition for companies. SaaS models offer more predictable
revenue streams, scalability, and opportunities for upselling and
cross-selling, but require significant changes to business operations,
including revenue recognition, billing, and sales compensation.
Companies that make the transition successfully can experience
improved financial performance and increased customer satisfaction. 

 5 PLANNING PITFALLS GTM TEAMS SHOULD AVOID (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 To achieve ambitious revenue targets, companies need a comprehensive
and integrated Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy that goes beyond simple
calculations and avoids common planning biases. Effective GTM planning
requires asking the right questions, utilizing frameworks like MOVE
and the 8-Pillar GTM Operating System, and ensuring Clarity,
Alignment, and Team (CAT) within the organization. Implementing these
strategies can help companies create high-performing GTM revenue
teams, stay aligned on common goals, and maximize output and
efficiency.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE VENTURFICATION OF RESEARCH (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The transition from research to commercialization is accelerating,
with top talent leaving academic and corporate research labs to start
venture-backed companies at earlier stages of technological readiness.
This shift is driven by a "researcher's prisoner's dilemma," where
researchers feel compelled to raise venture capital to avoid being
left behind by their peers. While this trend may temporarily slow
progress due to fragmentation, it ultimately concentrates talent and
capital into a few successful applied research companies that benefit
from competition and drive innovation forward. 

 3 STEPS TO WRITE MESSAGES THAT PEOPLE WILL ENJOY READING (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Effective communication is crucial in the workplace, and it starts
with clear and concise messaging. To achieve this, it's essential to
prepare by considering the purpose, goal, and audience of the message.
Then, write in a simple and straightforward style, avoiding jargon and
unnecessary words. Finally, review and edit the message to ensure it
is easy to understand and free of unnecessary information. 

 HOW AI CHANGES THE WORK OF SEO (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI has had a significant impact on the content and SEO ecosystem,
with machine-generated content challenging human-written content in
terms of quality. As a result, SEOs are shifting towards building
automated AI workflows and learning new skills with the help of AI,
while writers are focusing more on editing and curating AI-generated
content to bring it from good to great.
