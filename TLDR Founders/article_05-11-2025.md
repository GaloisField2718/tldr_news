 ALIGNING PRICING WITH AI-DRIVEN GROWTH MODELS: WHAT LEADERS AT
OPENAI, ZAPIER, AND SALESFORCE ARE SAYING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 At Metronome's Monetize 2025 conference, one thing was clear: pricing
has gone from a tactical play to a board-level conversation, as
companies grapple with ways to align value with monetization in the
age of AI [4]:

 	* Zapier moved from pure PLG to enterprise sales.
 	* Temporal opened sales-led infrastructure to self-serve.
 	* Salesforce introduced "flex agreements" trading seats for
consumption.

Top operators are focused on [4]building systems where PLG and SLG
coexist, creating predictability in usage-based models, and
establishing clear ownership via Chief Value Officer roles.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 SEQUOIA CAPITAL TRANSITIONS TO NEW LEADERSHIP (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sequoia Capital has elevated Alfred Lin and Pat Grady to firm
stewards, succeeding Roelof Botha. Lin and Grady led Sequoia's early
and growth-stage investments, backing companies like Airbnb, DoorDash,
HubSpot, and Zoom. Botha, known for creating the scout program and
leading fund restructuring, will remain with the firm. 

 ON THE ‘NEW' Y COMBINATOR (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 YC's latest batches look like a time warp to its early days, but with
an AI-era twist. The average founder is now 26, often a Stanford or
MIT grad who left OpenAI, Stripe, or Google to build fast in San
Francisco. Nearly 85% of YC startups are Bay Area–based, half the
founders come from top 20 universities, and almost as many worked at
top-tier employers. They're technical, pedigreed, and surrounded by
alumni who've done it before.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHERE YOU BUILD IS WHO YOU ARE: THE ELEVENLABS STORY (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 ElevenLabs didn't start in San Francisco, and that might be its
biggest advantage. Born from the frustration of single-voice dubs in
Poland, the company built an AI that gives machines human nuance -
tone, emotion, and accent - shaped by a team spread across London,
Warsaw, and San Francisco. Geography became the edge: only people
who've heard meaning flattened by translation would obsess over making
voice universal again. The company's rulebook is pragmatic: if
research can't solve a problem in three months, building a good
product will. Work with creatives instead of against them. Pay artists
for their voices. Scale globally, but keep the culture weird and
local. 

 LESS-IS-BETTER EFFECT (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A $16 NARS mini concealer costs more than double per ounce than the
full size, yet it outsells it. Psychologist Christopher Hsee found
that when we judge one thing in isolation, our brains anchor on what's
easy to notice, not what's objectively better. A small cup overflowing
with ice cream feels richer than a big one half empty. The same logic
drives how we buy. A tiny luxury feels premium, a pre-portioned meal
kit feels smart, a mini beauty product feels indulgent. 

 WHEN THE MUSIC'S OVER: FOUNDER LIFE AFTER FAILURE (6 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Founders should set clear financial boundaries, track personal
runway, and avoid personal debt while running a startup. Shifting
quickly into advisory or consulting roles helps monetize lessons
learned and regain momentum. Openly sharing failures builds
credibility and signals readiness for future opportunities.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In business, everything feels urgent until you notice that only one
thing actually changes the outcome. Jim Kilts saw that at Gillette.
Faced with seven turnaround options and endless noise, he picked one
core issue in each line, kept Duracell and fixed marketing discipline,
pulled personal care out from razors, focused only on dry shaving, and
ignored the rest. Ask what truly drives the result, drop the rest
fast, and repeat until it becomes instinct. That's how good operators
think and how wisdom begins. 

 A SIMPLE TEST FOR DEVELOPING TASTE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Taste isn't about what you like—it's about how your preferences
change once you've seen something better. You read Middlemarch after
Remains of the Day, and suddenly the scale resets. You can't unsee the
difference. That's how taste develops: through comparison, awareness,
and the slow upgrading of what you think good means. It happens in
every field - music, design, writing, code. The more you expose
yourself to better work, the clearer your sense of what fits. 

 WHAT IF WE ARE THE BUBBLE? (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Everyone keeps wondering if AI is the bubble. What if the bubble is
us? For decades, we've treated human labor (especially knowledge work)
as sacred and scarce, when much of it is just bureaucracy in disguise.
Startups bragged about headcount, not output. Corporations paid armies
to copy, check, and forward information. Now AI is quietly marking
those tasks to market.

 AI WINS WHEN IT DOES THE GTM WORK PEOPLE WON'T (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 An AI SDR booked a six-figure meeting while the team was at dinner at

the point. 

 CIRCULAR FINANCING: DOES NVIDIA'S $110B BET ECHO THE TELECOM BUBBLE?

bubble's risky loans.
