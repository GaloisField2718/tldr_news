 AI PRICING STRATEGIES FROM ANDREESSEN HOROWITZ'S MARTIN CASADO
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you're struggling to figure out your AI pricing, this live webinar
[4] is for you. Martin Casado, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz,
will share new monetization strategies that go beyond flat fees and
subscription models.

This session will look at how companies like OpenAI are building
monetization infrastructure [4], and why AI is forcing every SaaS
company to reinvent its own pricing and billing. Topics include:

 	* Why AI is accelerating the shift from pure subscription models to
results-based and hybrid monetization models
 	* How fast-growing AI companies are aligning product, finance, GTM,
and engineering
 	* How to treat pricing like a product to enable experimentation and
scale

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 STARTUPS INVESTING IN STARTUPS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 When startups start acting like VCs, something's shifted. Vercel,
barely past $200M in revenue, is now using investor cash to fund other
startups, calling it ecosystem building. Maybe it's smart positioning
in the AI infrastructure race, or maybe it's the oldest sign of a
bubble. 

 IS AI ADOPTION SLOWING DOWN? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 What if the AI boom isn't cooling off, just maturing faster than
expected? Ramp's latest data shows paid AI adoption dipping again,
even as retention jumps from 60 to 80 percent. Tech and finance lead
the pack, but most industries still haven't caught up. The surprise is
that companies aren't buying less, they're buying smarter. For
founders, the gold rush phase is ending. The next wave belongs to
products that prove lasting, repeatable value. 

 LINKEDIN REVEALS 2025 TOP 50 US STARTUPS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LinkedIn released its 2025 Top 50 US Startups list, ranking companies
by employee growth, engagement, and talent demand. AI-focused firms
like Anthropic, Character.AI, and Replit dominate the top spots,
reflecting hiring momentum across the sector. Security startup
Chainguard secured the No. 18 position after raising $356 million and
reaching a $3.5 billion valuation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 INVESTOR CHURN (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Your failed round might not be about your product - it could be about
your process. Sixty percent of interested investors drift without ever
saying no. They stop replying, delay calls, and ghost quietly.
Investors see hundreds of deals quarterly. If your communication
rhythm breaks, you slide from active to maybe-later. In healthtech,
this gets worse because investors already expect slow timelines, so
any process sloppiness signals you'll struggle with execution too.
Attention decay is the real enemy - momentum leaks silently between
interactions, and once that energy disappears, it's almost impossible
to reignite 

 BUILDING OUTBOUND FROM SCRATCH: A FOUNDER'S PLAYBOOK (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Three weeks perfecting cold email copy. Zero emails reaching inboxes.
Salesmotion learned outbound the hard way - messaging doesn't matter
when everything bounces to spam. Once they fixed deliverability, the
actual sequence became clear. Build your account list first, maybe 200
companies that look like your best customers. Then work on
infrastructure - validate emails, warm domains, send 10 per day max
while you test. After that works, test messaging in small batches
against specific personas. Track who responds from your target
accounts, not just total replies. 

 EVERYONE SHOULD BE USING CLAUDE CODE MORE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Claude Code offers versatile AI capabilities for non-technical users,
running locally to manage tasks like file organization, image
enhancement, and video downloads. It excels in handling large files
efficiently and performing tasks beyond cloud-based AI tools. Users
share creative applications, including generating domain names,
synthesizing customer call transcripts, and creating self-driving
documentation.

 PROMPTLESS (TOOL) [11] 

 Promptless is an AI teammate that proactively drafts and updates
customer-facing docs based on product changes and team activity.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MOMENTUM != MOAT (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 An a16z partner just claimed momentum is the only moat that matters -
get to $2M ARR in ten days or you're not interesting. Sounds exciting
until you notice this mindset is poisoning an entire generation of
companies. When billion-dollar funds only care about triple-digit
growth rates, they're effectively declaring that 95% of successful
business outcomes shouldn't exist. Wealthfront took 17 years to hit
$308M revenue and $123M profit - that's a fantastic business, but to
momentum investors it's a failure. The worse problem is that momentum
attracts competition like blood in water. Legal AI, code gen, AI
copywriters - every hot category now has five companies racing to
$100M ARR while burning unsustainable amounts on compute and customer
acquisition. 

 HOW TO BUILD CORE VALUES THAT MEAN SOMETHING (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Dolly Parton accidentally wrote the best business advice ever - find
out who you are and do it on purpose. Many companies build culture by
measuring employee satisfaction scores or forming wordsmithing
aspirational phrases about who they want to become someday. That's
backwards. Your core values already exist in how your best people
behave currently. 

 WHO IS GOVERNING AI COMPANIES? FOR NEARLY HALF OF AI STARTUPS IN
CALIFORNIA, THE ANSWER IS ONLY MEN (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A study of 140 AI companies in California revealed that women occupy
only 15% of board seats in private AI startups, and 43% of these
companies have no women on their boards. The lack of gender diversity
stems from structural biases favoring executives and investors, areas
where women are underrepresented, and behavioral biases that
prioritize familiar candidates over diverse talent. The study suggests
that appointing independent directors and expanding search networks
can help improve board diversity.
