HEADLINES & TRENDS

 STARTUPS ARE STILL BUYING FEWER STARTUPS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Startup acquisitions by other startups hit a 3-year low in 2023 and
continue to look sluggish in 2024. With valuations falling and big
tech acquirers steering clear, startups looking to sell may have
limited options and may have to settle for smaller deals focused on
investor returns rather than big exits.

$250 million in Series E funding. This values the company at $6
billion, a 67% increase from its previous valuation. Its generative AI
tech is used in developing software for automotive, trucking, and
other industries, leading to profitable triple-digit growth and
partnerships with major manufacturers.

tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to other models

resolving 13.86% of issues end-to-end without human intervention.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW AMPLITUDE BUILT A $4B COMPANY (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amplitude's journey from a failed YC pitch to a $4 billion public
company is a masterclass in perseverance. Despite initially gaining
traction for their voice-to-text app, the founders pivoted after being
unable to solve retention issues. Their story shows the importance of
listening to users, boldly charging higher prices when possible, and
being willing to abandon products that aren't working. 

 YOU ARE FIRING PEOPLE TOO LATE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Firing someone is never easy, but waiting too long can be costly for
everyone. This candid account reveals how holding onto underperforming
employees slows down productivity and ultimately kills team morale.
Trust your gut and act decisively. Your future self ‚Äî and your team
‚Äî will thank you. 

 FINDING HIDDEN VALUE IN NICHE MARKETS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This author challenges the conventional VC wisdom that only large,
mass-market opportunities are worth pursuing. They make a compelling
case for the hidden value in smaller, specialized markets by detailing
the success of Procore and advocating for a strategic approach to
market segmentation and niche market exploitation. Founders and
investors alike should reconsider their assumptions about market size
and potential ‚Äì the next big success story may well emerge from a
niche market.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TOO SMART FOR YOUR OWN GOOD (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 While intelligence is highly prized, it can also lead to detrimental
outcomes such as overconfidence, disregard for insights from less
credentialed individuals, and resistance to change due to an
attachment to one's intellectual reputation. These pitfalls prevent
smart people from adapting to new information and embracing the best
ideas. 

 FIRST-TIME VERSUS REPEAT FOUNDER (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 While repeat founders may have some advantages when it comes to
startup success, a recent report indicates that first-time
entrepreneurs still have a fair chance of success. Although serial
entrepreneurs find it easier to secure venture capital funding and
negotiate favorable terms, nearly 18% of first-time founders managed
to achieve a successful exit. 

 EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND AI ESCAPE VELOCITY (20 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI Futurist Ray Kurzweil invented the law of accelerating returns,
which states that the rate of progress is increasing at an exponential
rate over time. In a recent discussion, Kurzweil explored various
topics including prospects that are only getting better, the direction
in which the AI economy is headed, human relationships with AIs,
longevity escape velocity, and much more.
