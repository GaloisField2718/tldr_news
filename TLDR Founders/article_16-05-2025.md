 THE HIDDEN COMPLIANCE COST: HOW TO SHIP ENTERPRISE READY APPS FASTER
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Enterprise customers don't just want a polished product—they demand
SSO, SCIM, Audit Logs and role-based access before rollout is even an
option. Building all that in-house [5] drains time and diverts focus
from shipping core features.

WorkOS [6] takes that burden off your team. With just a few lines of
code, you can offer everything you need for Enterprise Ready
apps—without the overhead.

Keep building. Let WorkOS handle the enterprise identity layer. [7]

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 STATE OF PRIVATE MARKETS: Q1 2025 (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Venture investors are becoming more selective but paying higher
prices, with median pre-money valuations rising at nearly every
funding stage despite falling deal counts. Series D valuations soared
211% year-over-year, while dilution decreased across all stages,
showing investors' growing willingness to compete for the best
startups. 

 A16Z IDENTIFIES NINE KEY DEVELOPER PATTERNS IN THE AI ERA (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Andreessen Horowitz identified nine key developer patterns emerging
in the AI era. These patterns fundamentally reshaped how developers
built software and what tools they used. 

 ATOMIC TEAMS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Tech companies like Plaid succeed through "atomic teams," small
focused groups (2-8 people) dedicated entirely to a single project.
These teams prioritize clear goals, internal communication, and
minimal hierarchy to ensure agility and effective decision-making.
They also appoint a leader to protect from external processes and
support the team through challenges.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOU NEED A BETTER TESTING STRATEGY (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Most A/B testing approaches are fundamentally broken. Companies
blindly copy "best practices" that actually lose in head-to-head
tests, like single CTAs in heroes and plain backgrounds on signup
pages. Even worse, when tests contradict internal agendas, companies
frequently ignore the results. We're heading toward an evolution
similar to what happened with ad targeting in 2018 – fewer, more
targeted tests informed by actual winning patterns rather than
conventional wisdom. 

 HOW TO GET SMART AGAIN (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The digital age has created a productivity paradox: our constant
connectivity actually diminishes our ability to think deeply. Mindless
multitasking and endless scrolling gradually erodes attention span and
intellectual curiosity. This post shares a three-month "brain reset" -
deliberate constraints (deleting social apps, creating reading
structures, and eliminating background content) in order to restore
the focus and depth of thought that genuine innovation requires.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE HIDDEN BENEFITS OF BEING AN OPEN-SOURCE STARTUP (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Open source creates powerful competitive advantages beyond just free
distribution. Beyond just differentiation, open source creates
multiple competitive advantages: engineers can review code before
joining, users provide direct feedback on GitHub, and transparency
builds trust with skeptical developers. The approach isn't without
challenges – monetization is tricky, support requests can overwhelm
teams, and you might compete with your own free product. 

 TWO RADICAL NEW SOLUTIONS TO B2B REVENUE ATTRIBUTION (5 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Most founders still can't confidently answer questions like “How
much did it cost us to acquire this customer?” or “How can we
increase our pipeline without a bigger budget?” Even with fancy
multi-touch attribution models, the data is still too fragmented to
trust. Upside published a technical deep dive into how it is using two
state-of-the-art techniques to solve this age-old problem: radically
improving data quality with AI and graph databases, and extracting
deal stories using agentic AI analysis. 

 VENTURE CAPITAL'S SECOND(ARY) CHANCE (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The traditional venture capital model of holding investments until
exit is being challenged by extended private market lifecycles and
complex exit mechanics. Secondary markets offer a solution, allowing
early-stage investors to capitalize on opportunities and manage their
portfolios more strategically. Shifting to "secondaries by default"
ensures better returns and responsible fund management.
