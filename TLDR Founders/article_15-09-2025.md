 7 PRODUCT STRATEGY EXAMPLES (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A B2C finance app strategy centers on behavioral design and habit
nudges to drive goal completion, using a measurable North Star metric
and a Now‐Next‐Later roadmap structure. A compliance automation
product prioritizes modular onboarding for frameworks, proactive
alerts, and quarterly customer roundtables, aligning legal and product
goals. A freelancer-client marketplace leans into quality and trust
with verified matches, dispute handling, and user-informed roadmaps to
boost retention and project outcomes. 

 WHY YOUR AI PRODUCT NEEDS A DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE (22
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI products require a different development lifecycle compared to
traditional software due to their non-deterministic nature and the
balance between agency and control. The Continuous
Calibration/Continuous Development (CC/CD) framework helps address
these challenges by continuously refining system behavior and
gradually granting more autonomy. This approach ensures stability,
user trust, and the successful scaling of AI products.
