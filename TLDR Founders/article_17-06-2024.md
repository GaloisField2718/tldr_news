HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE AI BILL THAT HAS BIG TECH PANICKED (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 California's SB 1047, which would require safety testing for AI
models costing over $100M to train, has sparked debate. Some claim it
will destroy innovation, but others argue it's a necessary step to
address potentially catastrophic risks. The bill has become a litmus
test for the divided AI research community on whether to take such
dangers seriously. Finding the right policy balance is crucial as the
stakes are high on both sides. 

 IS SEAT BASED PRICING DEAD? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The traditional SaaS pricing model may be in jeopardy as AI enables
users to do more with fewer seats. Companies like Zendesk are already
shifting to consumption-based pricing for AI products. In an AI-first
world, the focus might shift from intuitive UIs to efficient data
structures that empower AI agents. This could signal a fundamental
shift in how pricing models operate moving forward. 

 HOW LEADERS CAN AVOID THE TRAP OF FALSE URGENCY (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 False urgency leads to an ‚Äúalways-on‚Äù culture and burnout.
Effective leadership involves prioritizing impactful work, not
urgency, to prevent burnout and promote productivity. Clear
communication, empowering teams, addressing root causes of
dysfunction, and rewarding genuine progress can transform an anxious
work culture into one driven by intentionality and strategic
focus‚Äìessential for startup success.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO ACTUALLY BE DATA-DRIVEN (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 For startup founders aiming to be data-driven, the golden rule is not
to focus solely on revenue as your primary KPI. Instead, establish a
Weekly Metrics Review meeting to align your team and track essential
driver metrics leading to revenue, ensuring everyone moves in the same
direction. This process involves identifying key metrics, engaging
Directly Responsible Individuals (DRIs) from across the organization,
and maintaining a swift, weekly cadence. 

 VENTURING INTO ABM: ADVICE FOR EARLY-STAGE GTM TEAMS (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 ABM is a channel that can create a significant lift in outbound
metrics when done right. However, it requires careful planning and a
long-term outlook, as it's unlikely to drive short-term revenue growth
for startups. The key is to have a clear owner, establish proper
measurements, and understand that ABM is a high-touch, personalized
approach that works best for high-value accounts with long sales
cycles and multiple stakeholders involved in the buying process. 

 HOW TO GET REPLIES FROM YOUR DREAM CUSTOMERS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Your dream customers are out there - discussing your niche, asking
questions you can answer. One way to surface these conversations is by
using Twitter's advanced search. Follow the right accounts, engage
with their content, and identify those asking questions your solution
can empower.

 4 STRATEGIES TO RECLAIM YOUR ATTENTION (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 There's a cost every time you switch tasks - here's a framework to
help reduce that cost.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE FILTER YOU USE CHANGES HOW YOU SEE THINGS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Our perception is shaped by the filters we apply, often
unconsciously. These filters can distort reality and strain
relationships. To counter this, we must recognize our biases, put on
"glasses" to see other viewpoints, ask for others' perspectives, and
consciously change our outlook. Engaging with those we struggle to
understand and learning about hidden aspects of the world can widen
our aperture. Embracing opportunities to adjust our focus enhances our
grasp of the big picture. 

 PRESENTEEISM: THE HIDDEN PRODUCTIVITY KILLER (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Presenteeism, or working long hours while neglecting one's health,
can be more damaging than absenteeism. Despite the flexibility that a
remote work culture promises, the pressure to be constantly available
persists (especially as a founder). It's okay to set clear boundaries,
take breaks, prioritize health, and seek support. Remember,
presenteeism is not a badge of honor. 

 WHAT MAGICAL FEEDBACK SOUNDS LIKE (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Barack Obama's feedback to his speechwriter, Cody Keenan, to "take a
full swing" on a eulogy draft, ignited a second wave of effort,
elevating the speech to a defining moment. Such "magical feedback"
acknowledges initial attempts while challenging people to push past
"good enough" to create truly powerful work. You can catalyze the
extra effort that fuels greatness by packaging feedback skillfully.
This research reveals exactly how. It includes a simple phrase to help
spark this second wind in your team.
