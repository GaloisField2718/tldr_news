 ONE MCP SERVER FOR 130+ INTEGRATIONS - POWERED BY PARAGON. (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 An MCP should make it easy to give your AI agent tools.

But native integrations for agents remain a huge challenge due to
complex 3rd-party APIs & authentication.

Paragon's MCP server [4] solves these problems.

With a single line of code, instantly enable your AI agent product to
interface with 1000+ actions across 3rd-party APIs.

The best part? All user authentication and monitoring [4] tools are
handled. Need access to an integration or action out of their
catalogue? Extend the Paragon MCP [4] with any OpenAPI spec.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 VERTICAL & COMPOUND SOFTWARE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Single feature software apps are becoming increasingly easy to build
and quickly turn into commodities, especially with the rise of AI
tools. However, two types of software continue to thrive: "vertical
software," tailored deeply to specific industries (such as Toast, Inc.
for restaurants), and "compound software," which combines multiple
related features around a shared data platform (like Rippling). Both
of these software approaches result in stronger customer loyalty,
better pricing power, and higher market valuations. Today, vertical
software companies trade at about 53% higher multiples compared to
general cloud software providers. 

 OPENAI IS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME STARTUP (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI secured a $40 billion funding round at a $300 billion
valuation, marking the largest ever capital raise for a private
company, yet it projects a $5 billion loss this year despite massive
user and revenue growth. The San Francisco-based company has rapidly
become a leader across multiple domains, combining cutting-edge AI
innovation with significant consumer and B2B milestones. Despite the
impressive numbers, OpenAI acknowledges that sustaining its ambitious
AGI goals will require many more funding rounds. 

 THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AI IN HEALTHCARE IS HERE NOW! (8 MINUTE READ) [7]


 AI presents a transformative opportunity to massively improve
healthcare while creating substantial economic value. With declining
computation costs, AI can provide near-free expertise and effectively
diagnose, monitor, and tailor treatments, rivaling and exceeding human
clinicians. Despite cultural resistance and systemic obstacles like
billing codes, adopting AI can dramatically cut costs, enhance care
quality, and expand access. This poses a significant opportunity for
innovative players in the healthcare industry.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SIX WAYS TO PROVE YOUR MARKET (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Investors often pass on startups because the potential market seems
too small. There are six concrete frameworks founders can use to
demonstrate market size clearly: presenting a large overall market
with room for expansion (like new geographies or product upgrades),
calculating bottom-up customer demand, aligning your product with
major industry shifts (e.g., AI or climate tech), drawing convincing
analogies (like calling your startup "Stripe for X"), starting in a
smaller market but showing clear growth paths, and describing a future
where new consumer habits dramatically expand the market. 

 5 INTERESTING LEARNINGS FROM WORKDAY AT $9 BILLION IN ARR (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 AI is significantly enhancing established B2B leaders like Workday,
which has boosted ARR to nearly $9 billion with 15% growth. Workday
leverages AI across its product suite, resulting in higher customer
retention, expanded ACV, and driving 30% of new customer expansions.
The company maintains a strong financial position with a substantial
subscription backlog and efficient operations. 

 THE AVERAGE STARTUP CEO SALARY IS UP TO $161,000 (1 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Kruze Consulting's latest data reveals seed-stage CEO salaries
average $147,000, with Series A and B CEO salaries at $203,000 and
$214,000 respectively. Seed stage CTOs earn around $134,000, while
CPOs earn $149,000. Overall, startup founder compensation ranges are
$130,000 for seed, $180,000-$190,000 for Series A, and
$250,000-$260,000 for Series B.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FOUNDER FIRST, UNICORN SECOND (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Most venture capitalists aim for billion-dollar unicorn startups,
even though 90% of venture-backed companies fail to reach these
massive valuations. This post presents an alternative investment
model, citing real-world examples like Mailchimp's patient,
bootstrapped journey to a $12 billion acquisition by Intuit Inc. and
Freshworks' steady, profitable growth to $100 million ARR with less
funding. Using data from Pitchbook and Cambridge Associates, it shows
how profit-sharing deals and slower, sustainable growth produce
healthier outcomes, higher founder satisfaction, and solid investor
returns. 

 THE DATA BEHIND GOOGLE'S AI OVERVIEWS: WHAT SUNDAR PICHAI WON'T TELL
YOU (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google CEO Sundar Pichai claims AI Overviews are transforming search
behavior, but new data from a 5-billion-query analysis tells a
different story. While Google visits increased 9% after the May 2024
rollout in the US, users actually spent less time per visit and query
length barely changed (just 0.6% longer). The data shows AI Overviews
are creating a "quick answer" pattern rather than deeper engagement -
users visit more frequently but leave faster. 

 CHAOS IS A LADDER (18 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Trade wars and supply-chain shocks might seem harmful for business,
but these chaotic moments can actually help startups beat
slower-moving incumbents. Tesla, Inc. quickly adapted during the
global chip shortage by rewriting software to use different components
while traditional carmakers like Ford Motor Company struggled. Drawing
from Norse mythology—where Loki's disruptions ultimately lead to
renewal—and historical shifts like Sony Corporation overtaking RCA
by embracing portable radios, this post highlights how flexible
companies that control their own product designs and supply chains
("vertical integrators") often seize ground when established giants
falter.

 AI tools have shown insane growth rates, but there's a problem

 TAKING INVESTOR FEEDBACK (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Founders and executives need to notice when criticism causes a
defensive reaction, pause, and instead become curious, asking
questions to fully understand the investor's perspective.
