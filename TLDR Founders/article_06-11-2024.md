HEADLINES & TRENDS

 DEFENSIBILITY: POWER (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In the early stages of a market, companies must focus on achieving
product-market fit. However, long-term success depends on building
structural power, such as branding or economies of scale, to fend off
competition. Beyond structural power, execution power - characterized
by speed, taste, and rainmaking - often drives success in dynamic
markets. As AI introduces "infinite leverage," execution power will
become even more crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. 

 ALWAYS BE LAUNCHING (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The modern product launch strategy meta has shifted from single,
high-impact announcements to a continuous engagement model called
"Always Be Launching", which emphasizes consistent, authentic
communication through social media channels. This approach recognizes
that in today's abundant media landscape, success comes from building
relationships over time through regular updates, customer stories, and
genuine interactions rather than relying on traditional gatekeepers
like journalists or PR agencies. The strategy's effectiveness stems
from its alignment with social media's constant content demands and
the shortened attention spans of modern audiences, making it more
likely to build lasting connections with customers and stakeholders. 

 WHAT *ACTUALLY* MATTERS WHEN RAISING A FUNDING ROUND (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Venture funding success depends heavily on meeting stage-specific
investor expectations. At pre-seed, investors prioritize strong
founding teams and vision, while the seed stage demands viable
business models and technological innovation. Concrete metrics and
scalability become crucial by Series A, with investors focusing on
user growth and revenue trends. Traditional markers like prestigious
degrees or detailed business plans matter less than effective capital
utilization and demonstrated market traction.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A DEADLY GRAVITATIONAL PULL IN PLG B2B: INDIVIDUAL-CENTRIC
EXPERIENCES (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The concept of Product-Led Growth (PLG) in B2B markets, while
initially successful due to its consumer-like approach, can be
perilous if it focuses solely on individual users. Successful B2B PLG
strategies must connect individual user adoption to enterprise-level
deals by fostering team collaboration and engagement. Companies should
design their products to encourage team use, track team-level metrics,
and leverage network effects to ensure sustainable growth and avoid
the pitfalls of a consumer-only focus. Notion successfully used this
approach by evolving from an individual tool to a team-oriented
platform, unlike Evernote, which struggled due to its limited team
integration. 

 OUTCOMES NOT SUBSCRIPTIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Intercom's Fin AI version 2 introduces a solution-based pricing model
that charges $0.99 per resolved customer query instead of a
traditional subscription fee. This approach aligns costs with
measurable outcomes, offering businesses flexibility and lowering the
barrier to entry, especially for those with fluctuating support needs.
However, while the model offers clear cost comparisons and
scalability, it may introduce unpredictability in expenses and
potential misalignment of service quality. 

 GUIDE TO CHANNEL-STARTUP FIT (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The belief that most successful startups rely on a single primary
growth channel is overly simplistic and misleading. Effective growth
strategies require a combination of multiple channels, much like
assembling a basketball team where each player (or channel) plays a
vital role. Startups should test, scale, and optimize various channels
over time to ensure long-term growth, especially as marketing evolves
with AI and automation. This post provides insights into five key
growth engines - Inbound, Outbound, Product Virality, Events, and
Ecosystem - and offers guidance on how to combine them for maximum
impact.

 WANT TO START THE NEXT BILLION-DOLLAR AI COMPANY? SEVEN FRAMEWORKS
FOR AI-ENABLED VERTICAL SAAS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Seven powerful frameworks have emerged for building successful
vertical AI companies, representing a potential $6 trillion
opportunity in annual services spend. These frameworks include
networked SaaS platforms connecting multiple stakeholders, data
defensibility through proprietary datasets, and AI-business-in-a-box
solutions that enable entrepreneurs to launch AI-driven ventures with
turnkey operations. The key to success lies in reimagining specific
industry verticals from the ground up rather than creating
general-purpose AI tools, with a focus on addressing unstructured data
and creating defensible market positions through innovative approaches
to product development and monetization. 

 READ MORE BOOKS (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Reading is a powerful tool for personal growth and learning.
Successful figures like Warren Buffett dedicate up to 80% of their
working days to reading and thinking. Barack Obama maintained a daily
30-minute reading habit even during his presidency. Americans spend
over two hours daily on social media and three hours watching TV. Only
46% have read a book in the past year, highlighting a significant
opportunity to reallocate time more productively. It is important to
focus reading in specific areas of interest to build a strong
knowledge foundation. Mastering a niche before expanding leads to
better retention and understanding of complex topics. 

 WHY EVERY CEO SHOULD PRIORITIZE HAVING A STRONG CEO-CMO PARTNERSHIP
(4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The relationship between CEOs and CMOs is often strained due to
misalignment and lack of understanding, with only 10% of Fortune 250
CEOs having marketing experience and just 32% of CEOs trusting their
CMOs. A successful CEO-CMO partnership requires clear role definition,
focused priorities, and alignment on business objectives. Marketing
responsibilities should not be too broad and ambiguous. Companies that
position marketing as a core growth driver are twice as likely to
achieve over 5% annual revenue growth. It is important to provide CMOs
with proper resources, autonomy, and clear alignment with
organizational goals.

 BLEMISHING EFFECT (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Research shows that introducing a small negative feature can enhance
the appeal of the product when customers already have a positive
impression. 

 THE CLOUD BUBBLE LASTED ABOUT 18 MONTHS. HOW LONG WILL THE AI BUBBLE
LAST? (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The rapid growth in SaaS and Cloud spending, fueled by the COVID-19
pandemic, created a temporary bubble that has since deflated, with
average growth rates dropping significantly from their 2021 highs. 

 THE NEW NORMAL FOR VC (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The current state of VC funding is the new normal, with US companies
raising around $21 billion per quarter in 2024, similar to pre-bubble
levels.
