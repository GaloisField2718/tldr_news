 HOW LOVABLE SOLVES AI MONETIZATION: A CONVERSATION WITH ELENA VERNA
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 As AI reshapes how software delivers value, traditional SaaS pricing
models are starting to break down.

In this live webinar [4], Elena Verna, Lovable's Head of Growth, will
share the monetization model [4] the team is building to navigate this
shift. Join to learn:

 	* Why AI has upended the logic of SaaS pricing, and why there's
still no clear playbook
 	* How Lovable is balancing self-serve adoption with enterprise
monetization
 	* What it takes to evolve from usage-based pricing to outcome-based
value

See where AI monetization is heading and what you can do to prepare

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 AI IS REWIRING THE ECONOMY (16 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI will force us to reconsider commerce, consumerism, and the norms
of our economy. It will commoditize knowledge work, destroying
consumer purchasing power. Human behavior will shift from consumption
to goal-seeking as AI handles routine tasks. New business models will
emerge that profit from human flourishing rather than human spending.
Consumerism will cease to be the driver of economic growth. 

 THE PRODUCT-MARKET FIT TREADMILL: WHY EVERY AI COMPANY IS SPRINTING
JUST TO STAY IN PLACE (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Product-Market Fit (PMF) used to be something companies would hit,
maintain, and scale. The core value propositions for AI companies are
up for grabs every week, causing them to flat-out sprint but still
stay in the same place. PMF is now a subscription that companies have
to keep renewing. Stable PMF will become possible again when we move
into the value cycle. This will be when real enterprise value is
created.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RB2B'S AI PLAYBOOK: 95% OF CUSTOMER INTERACTION HANDLED BY AI (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Founders need to treat AI like their best employee - train it daily,
give it the resources it needs, and hold it accountable for results.
AI is only as good as the content it is fed. Detailed instructions
give AI the ability to handle tough queries. Founders need to do the
actual work if they want to replace entire teams with AI. 

 THE ODDS OF MAKING IT (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Reaching $25 million ARR within 10 years is harder than getting into
Harvard. Only 1 in 50 startups achieves this milestone. Almost half of
software startups make it to $1 million ARR, though it usually takes
2-5 years. AI-native startups are 3X more likely to hit $1 million ARR
in six months compared to others. While living in the Bay Area helps,
it's not essential for success.

 PG_AI_QUERY — AI-POWERED SQL GENERATION & QUERY ANALYSIS FOR
POSTGRESQL (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 pg_ai_query is a PostgreSQL extension that brings AI-powered query
development directly into Postgres. It allows users to generate SQL
from natural language, analyze query performance using AI interpreted
EXPLAIN ANALYZE, receive index and rewrite recommendations, and
leverage schema-aware query intelligence with secure introspection.
pg_ai_query is designed to help developers write and tune SQL faster
without switching tools to accelerate iteration across complex
workloads. It integrates directly into PostgreSQL databases, providing
a seamless way to query data using plain English.

 Mitte is an AI creative suite for designing, animating, and voicing
content with studio-grade precision and performance.

 Clever is an AI explainer that uses voice and live visuals to break
down complex topics like a hyper-animated tutor on a digital
whiteboard.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MISSION, VISION, POTAYTO, POTAHTO (17 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Purpose requires figuring out the positive difference you can make in
the world, writing that succinctly, then incorporating it into your
strategy, positioning, and goals. Putting words you don't mean onto an
'About Us' page doesn't create a purpose. You don't have to be a
mission-driven company to succeed - most startups are too busy making
stuff anyway. 

 BOOM, BUBBLE, BUST, BOOM. WHY SHOULD AI BE DIFFERENT? (19 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 The AI revolution will only be three years old at the end of this
month. We are likely months, not years, from the end of the party.
While AI could be one of the biggest technology shifts in history, it
will take way longer to see changes than currently predicted. The size
of the current bubble is redefining how we look at previous bubbles.
There is currently too much spending with too much leverage, and the
deals are getting crazy. Competition with China is fierce - it is very
possible that China could win the AI race.
