HEADLINES & TRENDS

 THE SECOND $100B AI COMPANY (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The AI revolution is expected to propel new companies to achieve
market caps of over $100 billion, with consumer AI companies likely to
be among the biggest winners. The application layer of AI, where new
value is being created, is still in its early stages. The next few
years are expected to be key for the emergence of new AI companies.
Categories such as video, online shopping, and gaming are particularly
promising areas for consumer AI companies for achieving large-scale
success. 

 HOW AI WEDGES WILL HELP STARTUPS OUTMANEUVER INCUMBENTS (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 New AI-powered products are transforming traditional industries by
capturing data at the point of creation, bypassing traditional systems
of record and enabling startups to grow rapidly. These "wedge"
products, often powered by LLMs, are disrupting established players in
industries such as sales, insurance, and IT service management. By
integrating with existing systems, building workflows, and storing
data, these startups can create robust moats around their data
ecosystems and capture significant value, potentially triggering a
golden age of vertical software. 

 PERMIRA COMPLETES SQUARESPACE ACQUISITION FOR $7.2B (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Squarespace transitioned from a publicly traded company to private
ownership after Permira, a private equity firm, acquired all remaining
shares. Initially offering $44 per share, Permira increased its bid to
$46.50 per share, valuing the company at approximately $7.2 billion,
following recommendations that the initial offer did not maximize
shareholder value. Despite this acquisition, Squarespace's founder
Anthony Casalena retains a significant stake and continues as CEO. The
company also recently completed the sale of its restaurant reservation
service, Tock, to American Express for $400 million.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ANNUAL PLANNING SUCKS (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Annual planning can be a painful and often ineffective process for
companies, but it doesn't have to be. Companies can create more
effective and adaptable plans by tailoring planning approaches to
their specific needs and stages and focusing on key principles such as
balancing top-down direction with bottom-up proposals. In this
article, executives from companies like Linktree, Linear, Vanta, and
Notion share their experiences and strategies for successful annual
planning. They discuss the importance of constraining timelines,
setting clear investment areas, and anticipating potential
disruptions. 

 WHAT I LEARNED FROM TRACKING 443 SAAS PRICING PAGES (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Many SaaS companies are adjusting their pricing strategies, with 42%
of companies in a recent index making changes to their prices in the
first three quarters of 2024. These changes include price increases,
decreases, and updates to pricing pages, with some companies taking a
targeted approach to optimize revenue from high-value plans. The data
suggests that SaaS companies are embracing an iterative pricing
strategy, with many making multiple changes to their pricing over the
course of the year. 

 MANAGING EXPECTATIONS WITHOUT LOOKING UNAMBITIOUS (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Engaging with a CEO's ambitious ideas isn't about blind acceptance or
dismissal, but about strategic analysis and structured thinking. This
article outlines a three-step playbook for evaluating big ideas:
identifying real objectives, working backwards to determine necessary
conditions, and delivering a thoughtful analysis. This approach allows
team members to push back on unrealistic expectations without
appearing unambitious, fostering a culture of informed decision-making
and calculated risk-taking.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE EMPTY SUIT EXECUTIVE (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 "Empty suit executives" prioritize status over substance, often
avoiding direct customer interaction, delegating critical tasks, and
focusing on abstract strategy rather than tangible results. In
contrast, effective leaders are hands-on, prioritize customer
engagement, take responsibility for outcomes, and embody authenticity
and dedication. Aspire to be a genuine leader who is actively involved
in all aspects of the business rather than merely managing from a
distance. 

 AI IN VC: OUTLOOK FOR 2025 (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The number of venture capital firms adopting a data-driven approach
is expected to continue growing in 2025. Many new firms are just
starting their digitization journey. Despite a 26% increase in
data-driven VC firms from 2023 to 2024, the number of engineers
employed by these firms only grew by 13%, indicating that many firms
are still in the early stages of building their data capabilities.
This trend is expected to persist, with the number of data-driven VC
firms likely to surpass 250 globally in 2025. 

 A MESSAGE FROM THE PAST (THOUGHTS ON NOSTALGIA) (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Nostalgia often distorts our perception of the past, making us forget
the anxieties and uncertainties we experienced at the time. When we
look back, we tend to remember how we think we should have felt, given
what we know today, rather than how we actually felt. This phenomenon
can be seen in various aspects of life, including personal experiences
and economic events, where the benefit of hindsight makes it difficult
to recall the uncertainty and fear that once existed.
