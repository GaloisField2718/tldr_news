 HOW AI WILL REINVENT MARKETING (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In the coming decade, AI is expected to revolutionize marketing by

experiences at scale. 

 WHEN STEEP ENERGY GRADIENTS ARE YOUR FRIEND (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article discusses the importance of embracing challenging

Test," involves quickly delivering a rough, manual version of a
solution to a small group of customers to validate its value before
investing in optimization.
