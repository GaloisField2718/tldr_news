 EVER FEEL LIKE IT‚ÄôS NEAR-IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A GREAT WRITER TO SHARE
YOUR COMPANY‚ÄôS STORY? (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Every startup needs a Hemingway. A Don Draper. A David Ogilvy. But
those kinds of writers are, as you probably know, hard to find.

That‚Äôs why founders backed by Sequoia and Founders Fund work with
Uncommonly Bold [6].¬†

‚Üí You‚Äôll be working with the best writers in tech (people who‚Äôve
written for Demand Curve, Compound, Product Hunt, and more).

‚Üí We write thoughtful long-form pieces & short-form, high-converting
copy. Think manifestos, case studies, landing pages, and more.¬†

¬†‚Üí We are not an SEO farm. We don‚Äôt use AI to write pieces. And
we‚Äôre _not_ built for scale: we work with a small number of founders
each month.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 FIRST NEURALINK PATIENT CONTROLS COMPUTER MOUSE THROUGH THINKING (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Elon Musk announced that a patient implanted with Neuralink's brain
technology can control a computer mouse through thinking. Neuralink
has been working on developing a brain implant technology that allows
humans to utilize their neural signals to control external devices.
This breakthrough marks a significant step towards Neuralink's
ultimate goal of restoring lost capabilities such as vision, motor
function, and speech. 

 DISNEY STAR TURNED SPACE TECH CEO (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Former Disney Channel star turned MIT PhD graduate Bridgit Mendler
secured $6.3 million from major VC investors like Founders Fund and
Andreessen Horowitz for her space satellite startup Northwood Space.
Northwood Space aims to build satellite ground stations designed for
mass production and customer flexibility, with a vision of creating a
data highway between Earth and space. 

 SORA, GROQ, AND VIRTUAL REALITY (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A few years ago, the concept of the metaverse seemed like it was just
a fiction from Ernest Cline's book, and Facebook's metaverse push
seemed ill-fated. Today, things feel different. Sora generates complex
video scenarios and Groq's deterministic chips reduce machine-learning
algorithms for faster processing. Together, the convergence of these
advancements push closer to achieving real-time video simulation and
true virtual reality.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW COGNISM GENERATED $441K IN REVENUE WITH MONEY KEYWORDS (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Bottom-funnel content converts; awareness is overrated. In this
article, Cognism shares how it shifted its focus towards using
targeted "money keywords" that appeal to bottom-of-the-funnel buyers
instead of top-of-the-funnel visitors. This strategic move, which
optimized high-intent terms for the company's product fit, backlinks,
and conversion lifts, resulted in a revenue of $441K+ last year. 

 YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING WITH GPTS AT WORK (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 You should experiment with customer GPTs at your startup. This
article shows how to build a custom GPT and shares 20 examples of how
to use them to boost productivity. 

 TAM IS WHY I HAVE TRUST ISSUES (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Market sizing is a crucial task for any founder when evaluating
markets they plan to launch into, assessing potential product demand,
or presenting figures to investors. However, many get it wrong - do
you go bottoms-up or top-down? This article examines the drawbacks of
total addressable market analyses and provides insights on how to
approach market sizing with a more critical mindset.

 THE STATE OF SALES IN 2024 (10 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 An analysis of over 4.2 million opportunities revealed that economic
turbulence had a negative impact on B2B sales. This was evident with
falling win rates, lengthening sales cycles, and shrinking deals. In
2024, sales teams not only need to be more efficient - they need to be
more effective. 

 COMPRESSING SWITCHING COSTS IN SOFTWARE (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The cost of switching software can be prohibitively high in large
companies. The process could take years to complete and even more time
to see the payback. Often, executives are aware that the effects of
this decision will continue even beyond their time in office and
therefore avoid making changes. AI will significantly reduce the costs
and timeframes associated with switching systems, which could lead to
more innovation in large companies. 

 WHY VENTURE CAPITAL IS THE BEST ASSET CLASS (6 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Despite the bad rap that venture capital often gets, the world
benefits from the innovation generated by venture capital, both from
successful and failed investments, as it essentially gets all of that
innovation for free.

QUICK LINKS

 COULD A SEARCH COMPETITOR USE GOOGLE TO GAIN TRACTION? (4 MINUTE
READ) [21] 

 AI startup Perplexity is leveraging Google's own search traffic
against it by flooding results pages with answers to long-tail
questions. Could Google's search dominance be under threat? 

 ERIC SCHMIDT: THE BEST FOUNDERS ARE FRUGAL (1 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 If the majority of your budget is being spent on lavish offices and
nice chairs, you might want to reconsider your priorities. 

 NOBODY KNOWS: BLOCKCHAIN & STEEL (1 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Many people are unaware of the underlying technology behind today's
apps, just as they might not know the construction materials of their
office building. Existing platforms like Instagram and Salesforce will
likely transition to web3 infrastructure seamlessly once the benefits
of web3 become clear, with users remaining oblivious to the underlying
changes.
