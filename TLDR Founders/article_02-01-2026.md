 HOW THIS AI STARTUP CLOSES ITS BOOKS BY 1:35 PM - WITH TWO FINANCE
PEOPLE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In the latest Unpack Pricing podcast [4], Metronome CEO Scott Woody
talks with Nicolas Kopp, founder of Rillet (AI-native ERP, backed by
Sequoia, a16z, and Iconiq) about how AI is overhauling finance
operations.

The conversation covers how companies like Windsurf scaled to $100M+
with a tiny finance team, why 20 years of experience might now be a
hiring red flag [4], and how pricing changes that used to take 6
months can now happen in 2 hours. Kopp also shares why legacy ERPs
have a –3 NPS, and what's replacing them.

HEADLINES & TRENDS

 FOUR AI RESEARCH TRENDS ENTERPRISE TEAMS SHOULD WATCH IN 2026 (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Key AI research trends to watch in 2026 include continual learning,
world models, orchestration, and refinement. Continual learning
focuses on updating models without retraining, while world models
enable AI to understand environments autonomously. Orchestration
enhances efficiency by coordinating multiple tools, and refinement
improves outputs iteratively through feedback. 

 'COLLEGE DROPOUT' HAS BECOME THE MOST COVETED STARTUP FOUNDER
CREDENTIAL (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The trend of valuing college dropouts as startup founders has
resurged amid the AI boom, with many pitching it as a credential
during Y Combinator Demo Days. Despite high-profile examples and fears
of missing critical AI opportunities, most successful startup founders
hold degrees. VCs prioritize traits such as commitment and social
networks over dropout status, with some emphasizing the value of
wisdom gained from experience. 

 THE RACE TO RUN BUSINESSES AUTONOMOUSLY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cofounder, by The General Intelligence Company, enables businesses to
run autonomously through a network of coordinating agents that execute
repeatable workflows known as Flows. The platform employs layered
memory architectures to consolidate information, allowing agents to
operate independently with comprehensive knowledge. This approach aims
to reduce manual repetitive work and enable continuous, insightful,
and autonomous business operations.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 25 LESSONS FROM THE FIRST YEAR OF SOLO FOUNDERS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Solo founding is more viable than most assume. Key lessons: you can
achieve significant traction alone, momentum beats co-founder
searching, and early focus on the core product matters. Solo founders
benefit from generous equity, contractors-to-hires, and multitasking
enabled by AI. Mindset is crucial: endurance, pacing, and learning
from small pivots drive success. Emotional support and realistic
benchmarks prevent burnout. Fundraising, timing, and terms matter, but
execution outweighs optics. Ultimately, persistence and continuous
iteration define survival and growth. 

 BUILD THE WHOLE PRODUCT OR LOSE THE CUSTOMER (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Winning startups in 2026 will replace fragmented toolchains by
solving an entire end-to-end problem for a tightly defined customer
segment. The strongest teams will compete across categories to deliver
a single, integrated solution that beats stitching together multiple
incumbents on cost, speed, and experience. Square proved the model by
compressing payments, hardware, and POS into one system, cutting the
total cost of ownership and capturing value across the stack. 

 IS COMMUNITY THE MOST OVERLOOKED EDGE IN VENTURE CAPITAL? (9 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Community roles in VC are evolving beyond event planning to strategic
network development, becoming essential for mapping emerging networks
and unlocking investment opportunities. The need to treat community as
infrastructure is driving firms to institutionalize these roles,
leveraging relationships to find untapped potential before consensus
forms. Measuring meaningful metrics like founders sourced and
pre-empted rounds will crystallize community as a strategic discipline
rather than a peripheral function.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE CASE AGAINST DOOMERISM (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 2026 marks the mainstream arrival of AI capabilities that feel like
“magic,” making many traditional roles, like PMs, appear obsolete.
Doomerism stems from outdated experiences with early AI tools, but
avoiding these tools limits growth. Drawing lessons from chess, the
author argues that leveraging AI enhances judgment and output, while
refusal only widens the gap. Fear of dependency, not capability, is
the real challenge. Participation now shapes the future; opting out
leaves you behind. 

 THE NAVAN IPO REMINDS US: AI IS ON FIRE. EVERYTHING ELSE IN B2B?
STILL REALLY, REALLY HARD (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Navan's stock dropped 20% on day one when it went public in Q4 last
year. It is still trading 32% below its IPO price. Navan is a
legitimate B2B and SaaS category leader - but it isn't AI. Simply
being a SaaS company is no longer a ticket to a premium valuation,
unless you're building AI infrastructure, AI models, or AI agents.
