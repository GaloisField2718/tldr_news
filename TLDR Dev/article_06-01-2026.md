ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DATABASES IN 2025: A YEAR IN REVIEW (34 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 In 2025, PostgreSQL continued its market dominance, shown by
acquisitions from major tech companies and new distributed projects.
The year also saw the widespread adoption of Anthropic's Model Context
Protocol (MCP) for LLM interaction with databases, and a new intense
battleground for new open-source columnar file formats challenging
Parquet. 

 UNDERSTANDING SQL PARSERS (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SQL parsers convert SQL text into tree structures that computers can
analyze. There are many different parsers because every database has
its own dialect quirks, so no single parser handles everything
perfectly. If you just need to analyze queries, extract lineage, or
convert between dialects, then a SQL parser is good for that, while a
query engine is needed for actually running queries. 

 FUNCTORS, APPLICATIVES, AND MONADS: THE SCARY WORDS YOU ALREADY
UNDERSTAND (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Functors, Applicatives, and Monads are common patterns developers
already use. A Functor allows applying a function to a wrapped value
(like `Maybe.map`). An Applicative combines multiple wrapped values
with a multi-argument function (like `Maybe.map2`). A Monad handles
chaining operations where each step returns a wrapped value,
preventing nested containers (like `Maybe.andThen`).

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THOUGHTS ON CLAUDE CODE (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This dev built an imaginary programming language, Beep, over two
weeks in close cooperation with Claude Code and Opus 4.5. Claude was a
great programming partner, providing efficient solutions to complex
design challenges like lexical shadowing and dynamic scope mutation,
and easily handling mechanical refactors and obscure parser combinator
tasks. While Claude occasionally struggled with issues requiring
changes to external libraries or specific, non-obvious incantations,
its failure rate was low. 

 CODE REVIEW IN THE AGE OF AI (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI has increased code generation speed but has made code verification
more critical, with over 30% of senior developers now shipping mostly
AI-generated code that contains 75% more logic errors and 45% security
flaws compared to human-written code. Solo developers can move at
"inference speed" by relying heavily on automated testing (>70%
coverage) as safety nets, while teams still require human code review
for context, security, and knowledge transfer. 

 FROM SENIOR ENGINEER TO STAFF, WITH ANGELIC ASSISTANCE (9 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Advancing beyond a senior software engineer role to staff or
principal levels requires expertise, visibility, and intentionality.
Deliberate planning and strategic action are necessary for career
progression, going beyond simply accumulating skills. Engineers should
use AI where possible to increase the speed of accumulating expertise
and visibility.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WHY B2B COMMERCE ARCHITECTURES FAIL (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Modern B2B organizations operate across multiple systems, APIs, and
data models. Without a clear approach to integration and data
extensibility [10], even well-designed architectures become hard to
scale and expensive to maintain. Learn how to build a future-ready B2B
stack on the Elastic Path blog [10]. 

 REPOGREP (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Repogrep is an ultra-fast AI coding agent designed for codebase
search. It allows users to search across any public GitHub repository.
Users can input a GitHub repo URL or search by keyword to explore
codebases. 

 TAILSNITCH (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Tailsnitch is a security auditor for Tailscale configurations
designed to scan tailnets for over 50 misconfigurations, overly
permissive access controls, and security best practice violations. It
helps users identify critical and high-severity issues across various
categories like access, authentication, and network security. 

 CLAUDISH (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Claudish is a CLI tool that lets developers run Claude Code with any
AI model by proxying requests through a local Anthropic API-compatible
server. It works with multiple providers as well as local models.
Claudish can run agents in parallel, with each instance getting an
isolated proxy.

 ANTI-FRAMEWORKISM: CHOOSING NATIVE WEB APIS OVER FRAMEWORKS (8 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 "Anti-frameworkism" is the practice of starting web development
projects with native browser APIs rather than defaulting to JavaScript
frameworks like React or Vue. Modern browsers now handle most problems
that frameworks were originally designed to solve, including component
encapsulation (Web Components), styling (modern CSS), and network
requests (Fetch API), making frameworks often unnecessary. 

 WHY DIDN'T AI “JOIN THE WORKFORCE” IN 2025? (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 In late 2024, AI leaders like Sam Altman and Kevin Weil predicted
that 2025 would be the "Year of AI Agents," where these systems would
join the workforce and perform multi-step tasks like human employees.
However, this hype didn't translate into reality, as released AI agent
products weren't as effective as expected and fell significantly short
of their promised capabilities. Large language model technology isn't
yet robust enough for full human replacement.

QUICK LINKS

 TRY TO TAKE MY POSITION: THE BEST PROMOTION ADVICE I EVER GOT (4
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 To earn a promotion, consistently demonstrate you can handle the
responsibilities of the next-level role by proactively addressing
broader team problems with solutions over a sustained period of time. 

 I SWITCHED FROM VSCODE TO ZED (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This dev switched from VSCode to Zed, which he found to be a fast,
stable, and familiar IDE, despite a minor initial configuration
challenge for Python language server settings. 

 THE CONCISE TYPESCRIPT BOOK (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 The Concise TypeScript Book is a free, open-source resource that
provides an overview of TypeScript's capabilities, from its type
system to advanced features, for both beginners and experienced devs. 

 THE DONE LIST (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 AI is transforming the traditional to-do list into a "done list" by
automating the execution of tasks, shifting human focus to defining
clear intent and evaluating outcomes.
