ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE COUNTRY THAT BROKE KOTLIN (15 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A Turkish software engineer reported a mysterious Kotlin compiler
error in 2016, which was eventually traced to a locale-sensitive bug
in the `toLowerCase()` function that affected Turkish users. The issue
happened because Turkish has two forms of the letter 'i' (dotted and
dotless), so when the compiler converted XML message tags like "INFO"
to lowercase for lookup, it produced "ınfo" (with dotless ı) instead
of "info" on Turkish systems, causing the lookup to fail. This
seemingly minor bug took five years to properly identify and fix. 

 REVERSE ENGINEERING IWORK (24 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This dev created a Swift package called WorkKit to directly parse
iWork files (.key, .numbers, and .pages) without requiring export to
other formats or server-side processing. This involved reverse
engineering the iWork binary format, which uses Google's Protocol
Buffers, and extracting the schemas from the application executables.
WorkKit maps type IDs to Swift classes, decompresses the
Snappy-compressed data, and uses a two-pass system to load and merge
document content, which is then exposed to provide decoded data. 

 CONTEXT INHERITANCE IN TANSTACK ROUTER (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TanStack Router's context inheritance feature allows state and type
information to flow from parent routes to child routes in a type-safe
manner. Path parameters, search parameters, and router context can be
defined on parent routes and automatically become available to all
child routes with full TypeScript inference. This creates a system
where child components gain access to all accumulated state throughout
their parent route hierarchy.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THINGS I'VE LEARNED IN MY 7 YEARS IMPLEMENTING AI (8 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Current AI hype focuses too much on simple API calls, while the real
value lies in trivializing hard problems and boosting internal
productivity. While LLMs may be plateauing in improvement, current
capabilities are enough for certain use cases, like internal tools
development. Also, AI should not be an entire product, but rather
should work as a feature or a tool under the surface. 

 HOW I ALMOST GOT HACKED BY A 'JOB INTERVIEW' (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This dev narrowly avoided being hacked through a sophisticated scam
disguised as a legitimate job interview with a blockchain company. The
scam had a fake coding challenge containing obfuscated malware
designed to steal sensitive data like crypto wallets and passwords. He
was saved by using AI to scan the codebase for suspicious activity
before running it.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 APPLE UNLEASHES M5, THE NEXT BIG LEAP IN AI PERFORMANCE FOR APPLE
SILICON (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple's M5 chip will be featured in the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad
Pro, and Apple Vision Pro. It provides a jump in AI performance, with
a next-generation GPU architecture with Neural Accelerators in each
core and over 4x the peak GPU compute for AI compared to M4. It also
has better graphics, a faster CPU and Neural Engine, and increased
unified memory bandwidth. 

 INTRODUCING CLAUDE HAIKU 4.5 (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Anthropic has released Claude Haiku 4.5, a new small AI model that
offers near-frontier performance with greater cost-efficiency and
speed. This model surpasses its predecessor and even Claude Sonnet 4
in certain tasks like computer use, making it ideal for real-time
applications like chat assistants and pair programming. 

 WAHA (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 WAHA is an HTTP API (REST API) for WhatsApp designed for easy
installation and operation on your own server, with capabilities like
sending text messages. To start using WAHA, you need Docker installed,
after which you can download the WAHA image, run the API, start a new
session by scanning a QR code with your phone, and then send messages
via the API using the provided Swagger documentation.

 THE HISTORY OF CORE WEB VITALS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Core Web Vitals was launched by Google in May 2020 as a set of
standardized metrics that measure user experience by assessing website
loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability. The initiative was
meant to be a more open approach to improve web performance, and has
reportedly saved Chrome users over 30,000 years of waiting time
through 2024 by encouraging website optimization. These metrics were
developed based on research showing that pages meeting the Core Web
Vitals thresholds see 24% fewer user abandonments. 

 HOW FIRST WAP TRACKS PHONES AROUND THE WORLD (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 An investigation uncovered a massive archive of data showing the
global phone-tracking activities of a company called First Wap. First
Wap's tool, Altamides, exploits vulnerabilities in the SS7 telecom
protocol to track phone locations worldwide without detection on the
device itself. The data showed that First Wap tracked thousands of
individuals, including journalists, dissidents, and even individuals
like Anne Wojcicki, using this method. 

 CLAUDE HAIKU 4.5 WROTE 62% MORE CODE BUT SCORED 16% LOWER THAN SONNET
4.5 (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Anthropic's new Claude Haiku 4.5 model was tested on a WebSocket
refactoring task. While it produced the most code compared to other
models, its quality was much lower than Claude Sonnet 4.5. Haiku 4.5
over-engineered the solution, prioritizing thoroughness at the expense
of code quality, correctness, and maintainability.

 I AM A PROGRAMMER, NOT A RUBBER-STAMP THAT APPROVES COPILOT GENERATED
CODE (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Mandatory AI code generation tools during work are turning devs from
creators into mere approvers of AI-generated code. 

 ARE HARD DRIVES GETTING BETTER? LET'S REVISIT THE BATHTUB CURVE (12
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Backblaze's analysis of its hard drive data shows that hard drives
are improving in reliability and lasting longer, challenging the
traditional "bathtub curve" model of failure rates over time. 

 WHEN GOOD MODELS GO BAD (13 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Embedding models are necessary for AI applications like search and
recommendations, but upgrading to newer models can be costly and
disruptive due to incompatible vector spaces. 

 PWNING THE ENTIRE NIX ECOSYSTEM (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Researchers found and reported two vulnerabilities in Nixpkgs GitHub
Actions related to pull request targets that allowed potential code
injection and unauthorized access via command injection and local file
inclusion - they were quickly fixed by maintainers.
