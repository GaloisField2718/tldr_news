 BUILD HIGH PERFORMANCE RAG APPS WITH REDIS AND AWS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Generative AI applications require speed, scale, and reliability at
low cost. Redis Cloud on AWS [4] unifies client-side caching with your
primary data store to deliver high-throughput applications directly
from your AWS environment.

See how Redis Cloud integration extends GenAI capabilities with vector
storage and contextual awareness, including a step-by-step tutorial
for building an Amazon Bedrock agent.

 STATE OF THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING JOBS MARKET, 2025: WHAT HIRING
MANAGERS SEE (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The 2025 software engineering job market is experiencing a paradox:
companies are receiving a flood of applications (often 1,000+ per
role) but are struggling to find quality candidates, with most actual
hires coming from sourcing and referrals rather than inbound
applications. The market shows increased demand for product engineers
and founding engineers, with remote positions facing more competition
but offering slightly lower compensation. Also, issues like
AI-generated fake applications and interview cheating are becoming
growing problems. 

 USING DENO AS MY GAME ENGINE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Microlandia is a city builder game inspired by SimCity with a focus
on realistic simulation using real-world data. It was initially built
in Go, but the project faced challenges in creating a 3D view and a
full-featured UI. To overcome these hurdles, the game is being ported
to Deno, taking advantage of its cross-platform capabilities and
integration with web technologies like ThreeJS and React. 

 NODE.JS PERFORMANCE: PROCESSING 14GB FILES 78% FASTER WITH BUFFER
OPTIMIZATION (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A developer optimized Node.js performance for processing a 14.8GB
weather data file containing 1 billion temperature measurements to
achieve a 78% speedup. The main breakthrough involved bypassing
JavaScript's string encoding overhead by parsing raw bytes directly,
storing temperatures as integers (e.g., 25.3°C as 253 tenths), and
implementing a hash-first approach that only decoded station names
when absolutely necessary.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GPT-5-CODEX IS A BETTER AI RESEARCHER THAN ME (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This dev uses OpenAI's GPT-5-Codex to automate AI research, and he
found that Codex outperformed his solo efforts, especially in
generating coherent stories. The process involved a feedback loop
where Codex suggested experiments based on results, and Goedecke
selected or contributed ideas. The most successful approach was
distilling a transformer model from an n-gram model, which improved
story coherence by initially focusing on grammatical correctness. 

 YOU ARE HOLDING BUILD FILES WRONG (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 BUILD files in Bazel are more than just dependency lists and should
be used to encode a project's high-level architecture. By manually
managing BUILD files and defining larger conceptual targets,
developers can enforce module boundaries, detect architectural
violations early, and guide AI tools better. 

 DEPLOY SAFETY: REDUCING CUSTOMER IMPACT FROM CHANGE (8 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Slack implemented a "Deploy Safety Program" in 2023 to address the
fact that 73% of customer-facing incidents were caused by their own
code deployments, as the platform became increasingly mission-critical
for users. The program focused on automated detection and remediation
within 10 minutes. By January 2025, the initiative successfully
reduced customer impact hours by 90% from peak levels through a
combination of automated rollback systems, improved monitoring, and
cultural changes across their engineering organization.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING THE GEMINI 2.5 COMPUTER USE MODEL (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google DeepMind has introduced the Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model,
which allows agents to interact directly with user interfaces. This
model, available via the Gemini API, can navigate web pages and
applications by clicking, typing, and scrolling, outperforming
existing solutions with lower latency. The model analyzes user
requests and screenshots to generate UI actions, operating within a
loop for iterative task completion while prioritizing safety through
built-in features and developer controls. 

 ARC (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Arc is a high-performance time-series data warehouse built on DuckDB,
Parquet, and MinIO. It supports high-speed data ingestion and fast
analytical queries with SQL. 

 /DEV/PUSH (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 /dev/push is an open-source platform that offers a self-hostable
alternative to services like Vercel. It supports Git-based
deployments, environment management, team collaboration, custom
domains, and real-time monitoring.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT MAKES 5% OF AI AGENTS ACTUALLY WORK IN PRODUCTION? (12 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Successful AI agents in production depend on good context
engineering, governance, memory architecture, and multi-model
orchestration. Most AI deployments fail due to bad scaffolding around
the models. Also, trust in AI is built through human-in-the-loop
design and consistent, explainable behavior, positioning AI as an
assistant rather than an autonomous decision maker. 

 VIBE ENGINEERING (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Vibe Engineering is a responsible and stronger approach to software
development using AI, whereas "vibe coding" is more irresponsible.
Vibe engineering has experienced engineers using AI tools like coding
agents to speed up their work while still having high standards. This
approach requires strong software engineering practices such as
automated testing, planning, documentation, and code review, while
also relying on QA, research, and careful management of AI assistants.

 WHO NEEDS GIT WHEN YOU HAVE 1M CONTEXT WINDOWS? (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 An AI developer accidentally deleted working code but was able to
recover it using an LLM with a 1 million token context window, showing
an unexpected benefit of LLMs remembering past interactions. 

 PDOC (WEBSITE) [18] 

 Pdoc is a tool that automatically generates API documentation for
Python projects with features like type annotation support,
cross-linking, a built-in web server, and compatibility with various
docstring styles. 

 BECOME UNBANNABLE FROM YOUR EMAIL/GMAIL (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Email is a crucial digital asset, and you can gain control over it
and become "unbannable" by using your own domain with a trusted email
provider and backing up all emails to a local server. 

 PART I: HOW DOES GRADIENT DESCENT WORK? (23 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This is a mathematical guide to gradient descent during deep
learning, which is an optimization algorithm used to train machine
learning models by finding the minimum of a cost function.
