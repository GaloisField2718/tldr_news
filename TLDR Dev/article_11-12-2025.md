 FRONTIER CODING AGENT AMP SPINS OUT OF SOURCEGRAPH AS A SEPARATE
COMPANY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 9 months ago, Sourcegraph launched Amp as an experimental coding
agent - and it quickly grew to become one of the leading coding
agents.

Today, Amp has become its own company [4] - operating at the frontier
of software development. Amp is now a separate (profitable) business,
with a dedicated team [4] focused on exploring the boundaries of
software development to see what's possible.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW GOOGLE MAPS QUIETLY ALLOCATES SURVIVAL ACROSS LONDON'S
RESTAURANTS - AND HOW I BUILT A DASHBOARD TO SEE THROUGH IT (12 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google Maps algorithms influence London's restaurant scene as it acts
as a “market maker,” using prominence signals that create a
cumulative advantage for some restaurants. This was done by scraping
data from over 13,000 establishments and building a machine-learning
model. To counter this, this dev developed a dashboard that identifies
"underrated gems" by calculating the divergence between a restaurant's
actual rating and its algorithmically predicted performance. 

 HOW TO IMPLEMENT IOS WIDGETS IN EXPO APPS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Despite widgets requiring native Swift code, you can use Expo and the
`@bacons/apple-targets` plugin to integrate them together. This setup
allows the React Native app and Swift widget to share data via App
Groups and deep link back to the main app for expanded features.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GETTING A GEMINI API KEY IS AN EXERCISE IN FRUSTRATION (10 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Getting a Google Gemini 3 Pro API key in the Google Cloud Console is
unintuitive. This is because Google Cloud has many identically named
products, a complex billing setup, and an identity verification
process. 

 WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES YOU SENIOR (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The one core skill that separates senior engineers from everyone else
is the ability to reduce ambiguity. Senior engineers ask questions
nobody else asks, separate what matters from the noise, and identify
what should be done now. They're worth their salaries because they
derisk projects. When senior engineers do this well, it looks easy.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ADD "SIGN IN WITH VERCEL" TO YOUR APP (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Let users authenticate with their Vercel accounts. Setup takes
minutes: create an integration in Vercel's developer settings, add
credentials to Clerk, and enable it in your sign-in component. Ideal
for tools that integrate with Vercel's API or target the Vercel
ecosystem. Full setup guide in our docs [10]. 

 NUCLEATE (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Nucleate is an AI-powered platform that lets users build, customize,
and export beautiful, production-ready React Native mobile apps from
plain English descriptions. It has support for cloning, forking, and
exporting apps, along with basic design system integration. 

 PYTHON WORKERS REDUX: FAST COLD STARTS, PACKAGES, AND A UV-FIRST
WORKFLOW (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Python Workers allow Python developers to ship Python globally in
less than two minutes in a single command. Python Workers now supports
any package supported by Pyodide, the WebAssembly runtime that powers
Python Workers. It also now has dedicated memory snapshots to reduce
cold start times. This post shares some of the technical details
behind the changes. 

 AMAZON EC2 M9G INSTANCES (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Amazon EC2 M9g instances offer the best price performance for
general-purpose workloads.

 TELL US WHAT YOU REALLY, REALLY… DO NOT WANT TO SPEND TIME WORKING
ON (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A survey by Stack Overflow explored developer frustrations amidst
increasing AI adoption, finding that 84% currently use or plan to use
AI, mainly for coding, searching, and debugging. However, developer
problems aren't mainly from coding tasks themselves or AI's
shortcomings, but rather from a lack of adequate and accessible
documentation. Tasks like learning new codebases, deployments, and
handling support tickets become frustrating due to fragmented and bad
documentation efforts. 

 WHAT I LEARNED BUILDING A VECTOR DATABASE ON OBJECT STORAGE (16
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Building something is a great way to learn. This developer rebuilt
Turbopuffer, a vector database built entirely on object storage, to
understand the tradeoffs made in its development. The post follows
along as they figure out how to build a vector database from first
principles.
