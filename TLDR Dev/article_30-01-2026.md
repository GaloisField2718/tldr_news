ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DEEP DIVE INTO TURSO, THE "SQLITE REWRITE IN RUST" (7 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Turso is a database engine written in Rust. Designed as a rewrite of
SQLite, it resolves SQLite's issues, such as a closed test suite, lack
of concurrent writes, and C's memory management problems, by having
built-in encryption, MVCC support, and the safety benefits of Rust.
Unlike SQLite, Turso has the ability to scale from an in-process
embedded database to a networked, cloud-hosted solution. 

 IMPLEMENTING LOCAL-FIRST AGENTIC AI: A PRACTICAL GUIDE (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 LogRocket built an HR triage system that processes sensitive employee
reports entirely on a local laptop using three small AI models
(90M-3.8B parameters) instead of cloud APIs. The pipeline identifies
the issue, creates an action plan, then executes functions like
opening HR cases, all in 10-30 seconds without a GPU. This keeps
private data on-premises, costs nothing in API fees, and trades the
flexibility of big LLMs for control and privacy companies. 

 FIXING TYPESCRIPT PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS: A CASE STUDY (9 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Viget's TypeScript monorepo had become painfully slow, so its team
used `tsc --generateTrace` to find one file taking 80 seconds to
type-check. They deleted parts of the file with complex type
inference, inlined queries within the file which previously required
expensive type-checking, and cleaned up circular deps and barrel
files.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BACKSEAT SOFTWARE (22 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Modern software has devolved into "backseat software" that constantly
interrupts and tries to manage user behavior. This evolution began
with the internet enabling updates and telemetry, gradually escalating
as companies prioritized optimizing engagement metrics through
measurement, A/B testing, and pervasive nudges. The ideal alternative
to this is quiet that respects user attention and treats communication
as opt-in. 

 SOFTWARE IS MOSTLY ALL YOU NEED (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI coding agents are amazing at writing software. However, there is a
critical distinction: neural networks excel at "judgment" (fuzzy
pattern matching and subjective decisions), while traditional software
is great for "execution" (deterministic, explicit logic).

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GO FROM 0 TO SHIPPED WITH VIBE CODING THAT ACTUALLY WORKS (SPONSOR)
[9] 

 The old SDLC no longer reflects how teams work. v0 [9] treats
software like a living document where you build directly using prompts
and previews. Every prompt creates production code in your git
repository so you can focus on architecture, quality, and control.
Start collaborating on the product, not on documents [9] 

 MACTOP (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 mactop is a terminal-based monitoring tool for Apple Silicon chips
that provides real-time system metrics directly in the console. It
displays data like CPU and GPU usage, power consumption, temperatures,
memory, network activity, disk I/O, and detailed Thunderbolt
information. 

 NPMGRAPH (WEBSITE) [11] 

 This is an easy way to explore npm modules and dependencies.

MISCELLANEOUS

 IS THE RAM SHORTAGE KILLING SMALL VPS HOSTS? (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The current shortage and soaring prices of DRAM are driven by AI's
demand, and it's severely impacting small Virtual Private Server (VPS)
hosts. If the focus remains solely on AI and Big Tech, small VPS hosts
risk dying out, much like the independent ISPs of the past. 

 CONTEXTUAL AGENT PLAYBOOKS AND TOOLS: HOW LINKEDIN GAVE AI CODING
AGENTS ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 LinkedIn built an “agent life-cycle service” that gives AI coding
agents memory and context about how the company actually works.
Instead of starting fresh each time, agents remember conversation
history (so if you ask about engineers in SF then say “now
London,” it gets it), respect data permissions through role-based
auth, and keep humans in the loop for sensitive stuff like sending
emails.

 PROJECT GENIE: EXPERIMENTING WITH INFINITE, INTERACTIVE WORLDS (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Project Genie is an experimental AI prototype from Google DeepMind
that allows Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US to create, explore,
and remix dynamic, interactive virtual worlds. 

 HOW TO CHOOSE COLORS FOR YOUR CLI APPLICATIONS (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Developing CLI applications requires limiting color choices to a
small, compatible set to guarantee readability across terminal themes,
as many common colors are illegible in popular configurations. 

 CLAUDE CODE OPUS 4.5 PERFORMANCE TRACKER (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This independent tracker monitors Claude Code with Opus 4.5
performance on SWE tasks daily using direct CLI benchmarks. 

 BEST LLMS FOR CODING IN 2026 (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 There's no single best coding LLM since you need different models for
different jobs.
