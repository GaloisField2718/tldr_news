 PRODUCTION-PERFECT PREVIEWS IN SECONDS, WITH DATA, FILES, AND
SERVICES INCLUDED... (SPONSOR) [4] 

 PREVIEWS ONLY WORK IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY LIKE PROD. This step-by-step
shows how a minimal .upsun/config.yaml, and one deploy hook clones
data, files, and services ON EVERY BRANCH. 

Push a branch, get a custom preview env URL, reproduce the bug,
validate the fix, merge with receipts.

Same topology, same routes, fresh safe data. No mocks, no kubectl.

If you've outgrown flaky staging, this is the simplest way to get
honest tests and faster reviews. Keep configuration in Git, and let CI
run against the real topology.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CLOUDFLARE OUTAGE ON NOVEMBER 18, 2025 (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cloudflare had a large outage yesterday due to a faulty configuration
file in its Bot Management system, which was triggered by a database
permissions change. This larger-than-expected file overloaded the
network's traffic routing software, resulting in widespread HTTP 5xx
errors and impacting services like Turnstile, Workers KV, and Access.
The issue was not a cyber attack. The team was able to resolve it by
stopping the faulty file propagation and restoring an earlier version,
bringing systems back to normal by 17:06 UTC. 

 EXPERIMENT: MAKING TYPESCRIPT IMMUTABLE-BY-DEFAULT (8 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 This exploration into making TypeScript immutable by default was
inspired by languages like Rust. By setting the `noLib` flag and
creating a custom `lib.d.ts` file, this dev successfully made arrays
and Records immutable unless explicitly declared as `MutableArray` or
`MutableRecord`. This was done by defining read-only properties and
omitting mutable methods in the default type definitions. 

 HIGH-PERFORMANCE SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING WITH CSS HIGHLIGHTS API (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The CSS Custom Highlight API is a performant alternative to
traditional syntax highlighting methods that rely on numerous DOM
elements. The API can help style arbitrary text ranges directly using
CSS without modifying the DOM, resulting in faster rendering and
reduced memory consumption. It's supported in modern browsers and is
done by defining CSS styles using the `::highlight()` pseudo-element
and registering text ranges with the browser's highlight registry.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 PROGRAMMING PRINCIPLES FOR SELF TAUGHT FRONT-END DEVELOPERS (8 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Front-end developers can write better code by following the "rule of
three" (only refactor code after you've written the same thing three
times to avoid over-engineering) and "make it work, make it right,
make it fast" (prioritize getting code to function correctly before
optimizing for performance). These guidelines help devs make better
decisions while coding and avoid common pitfalls like premature
optimization and unnecessary complexity. 

 DO NOT PUT YOUR SITE BEHIND CLOUDFLARE IF YOU DON'T NEED TO (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 A recent Cloudflare outage took down many websites, showing the risk
of relying on centralized services as single points of failure. Many
smaller websites don't actually need Cloudflare's DDoS protection and
are unnecessarily exposed to its potential downtime. Instead of
Cloudflare, it's possible to just use a round-robin DNS setup with a
backup server for true redundancy.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 KILL CREDENTIAL STUFFING FOR GOOD (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Tired of credential stuffing threats? Clerk's new "Client Trust"
feature [12] automatically requires a second factor on any new
device—protecting users, even if their password gets leaked in a
0-day attack. No configuration, no guesswork. Stop worrying about
credential leaks: get invisible, decisive security from day one! 

 A NEW ERA OF INTELLIGENCE WITH GEMINI 3 (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google has launched Gemini 3, its most intelligent AI model yet.
Designed to help users bring any idea to life through state-of-the-art
reasoning and multimodal capabilities, Gemini 3 outperforms previous
models on key AI benchmarks and introduces a "Deep Think" mode for
even more complex problem-solving. It is being rolled out across
Google products, including Search, the Gemini app, AI Studio, Vertex
AI, and a new agentic development platform called Google Antigravity. 

 GOOGLE ANTIGRAVITY (WEBSITE) [14] 

 Google's Antigravity is a new AI-powered agentic development platform
built on Gemini 3. Antigravity has both an AI-powered IDE experience
("Editor view") and an agent-first interface for orchestrating
multiple agents ("Manager surface"). 

 GUTS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Guts is a Go library that converts Golang types to TypeScript for
consistent type definitions across frontend and backend applications.
Unlike command-line utilities, Guts is designed for programmatic
customization and easier package resolution. It uses the TypeScript
compiler API to make sure generated TypeScript is semantically correct
and aligned with the latest language features.

 AI IS WRITING YOUR CODE, BUT WHO'S REVIEWING IT? (8 MINUTE READ) [16]


 AI codegen tools are creating a new form of technical debt (“AI
slop”): bloated, buggy code that doesn't have proper architecture
and includes redundant functions. To address this problem, AI-powered
code review tools act as automated senior engineers, analyzing code
for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and architectural
problems. This leads to an agentic software development lifecycle
where specialized AI agents handle generation and review tasks, while
human developers act as architects instead. 

 HOW QUAKE.EXE GOT ITS TCP/IP STACK (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In 1996, Quake faced challenges adapting to the shift from MS-DOS to
Windows 95 while also supporting emerging technologies like 3D
acceleration and the Internet. id Software created a single
executable, quake.exe, compatible with both DOS and Windows by using
djgpp's DPMI client and the Windows 95 DPMI server. For TCP/IP support
in DOS, Quake relied on a costly third-party TSR, but in Windows 95,
it utilized Mpath's "Chunnel" technology, a complex system involving
virtual device drivers and DLLs to bridge the DOS executable with the
Windows TCP/IP stack. 

 AI ADS ARE GOING MAINSTREAM (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AI-generated advertisements are becoming mainstream. Major brands
like Taylor Swift, Google, and Coca-Cola have begun using AI tools to
create marketing content. Swift's promotional videos were confirmed to
be AI-generated using Google's video generation tools. The trend is
accelerating rapidly. Surveys predict that 39% of digital video ads
will use generative AI by next year. While early AI-generated ads
faced some controversy, consumer backlash appears to be weakening.
