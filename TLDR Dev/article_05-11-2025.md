 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AI CODING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 How can your team use AI coding effectively without drowning in
security risks and new technical debt?

Discover the 7 essential habits you need to confidently adopt AI,
reduce toil, and ship secure, high-quality code. Read this ebook from
Sonar [5] to learn how to:

 	* Boost real engineering productivity and velocity, not just code
volume.
 	* Ensure AI-generated code is secure, reliable, and maintainable.
 	* Foster a culture of developer accountability.
 	* Tackle the engineering productivity paradox.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 2X PERFORMANCE, $300K SAVINGS: A CASE STUDY IN REWRITING A CRITICAL
SERVICE IN RUST (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A TikTok intern tackled a CPU-bound payment service written in Go by
selectively rewriting the most intensive API endpoints in Rust. This
surgical rewrite resulted in a 2x performance increase, lower latency,
and reduced CPU and memory usage. Testing guaranteed correctness
before the Rust implementation was deployed, handling double the
traffic of the original Go service, which led to a projected annual
cost saving of nearly $300,000 in cloud expenses. 

 WHY NAN !== NAN IN JAVASCRIPT (AND THE IEEE 754 STORY BEHIND IT) (10
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NaN (Not a Number) in JavaScript is part of the IEEE 754 standard for
floating-point arithmetic, implemented at the hardware level, and
propagates through calculations. The unique comparison behavior (`NaN
!== NaN`) is an intentional design to enable the detection of invalid
mathematical operations. Before the standard, undefined operations
often crashed programs, but NaN allows computations to continue and
the error to be caught later. 

 THE INNER WORKINGS OF JAVASCRIPT SOURCE MAPS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 JavaScript source maps bridge the gap between minified production
code and original source files for debugging. This article goes
through the TypeScript build pipeline stages and the source map file
format, including the necessary "mappings" field, which uses encoding
to compress position data. The mappings field is structured using
commas and semicolons to represent segments and line breaks,
respectively.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SEND THIS ARTICLE TO YOUR FRIEND WHO STILL THINKS THE CLOUD IS A GOOD
IDEA (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This dev moved his projects off the cloud, resulting in a 10x
reduction in AWS costs. Many cloud-dependent developers, often those
in "devops" roles, criticized his decision, but he feels that renting
or even buying servers is much cheaper than using cloud services.
Developers should learn Linux, use AI tools for server management, and
consider alternatives like Cloudflare for added security. 

 SOME SOFTWARE BLOAT IS OK (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In today's era of powerful hardware, software efficiency is often
overlooked in favor of developer productivity and faster prototyping.
Some software bloat is acceptable as a tradeoff for benefits like
faster development cycles. However, a lot of bloat comes from
incompetence, laziness, and over-engineering, leading to performance
degradation and other issues.

 15 KUBERNETES METRICS YOU SHOULD BE TRACKING (SPONSOR) [11] 

 This free Datadog ebook [11] is your quick and useful reference for
essential K8s metrics to monitor - split across cluster state,
resource, and control plane metrics. Grab your copy [11] 

 WINDSURF CODEMAPS: UNDERSTAND CODE, BEFORE YOU VIBE IT (7 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Cognition has announced Windsurf Codemaps, an AI-annotated structured
map of codebases powered by SWE-1.5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 designed to
help devs quickly understand and navigate complex code. Codemaps
provides just-in-time mapping for tasks like debugging and
refactoring, allowing devs to visualize code structure, trace
functionality, and improve context for AI agents. 

 PG_LAKE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 pg_lake is an open-source project by Snowflake Labs that integrates
Iceberg and data lake files into PostgreSQL, allowing users to treat
Postgres as a lakehouse system. It allows for creating and modifying
Iceberg tables, querying various data formats stored in object stores
like S3, and exporting query results. The architecture includes
PostgreSQL with extensions and pgduck_server, which uses DuckDB for
query execution and uses a modular design with interoperating
components.

 EXPLORING A SPACE-BASED, SCALABLE AI INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM DESIGN (6
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Project Suncatcher is a Google moonshot exploring the potential of
scaling AI compute in space using solar-powered satellite
constellations equipped with TPUs and free-space optical links. The
project tackles problems like achieving data center-scale
inter-satellite links, controlling tightly-clustered satellite
formations, giving radiation tolerance to TPUs, and achieving economic
feasibility with reduced launch costs. Early research suggests that
space-based ML compute is viable. 

 FROZEN STRING LITERALS: PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE? (23 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article goes over the history, present state, and potential
future of frozen string literals in Ruby. It explains how Ruby strings
are mutable, unlike in many other languages, and the tradeoffs between
mutable and immutable strings. A new approach is proposed using
"chilled strings" to emit deprecation warnings. 

 WHAT IS A MANIFOLD? (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Manifolds are mathematical spaces that appear Euclidean when viewed
locally, similar to how the Earth seems flat on a small scale. This
concept revolutionized mathematics by treating space as an abstract
object, enabling the rigorous study of higher dimensions and the
development of modern topology. Mathematicians use "charts" and
"atlases" to translate regions of manifolds into familiar Euclidean
space, allowing the use of calculus and other techniques to analyze
their properties.

 APPLE VISION PRO'S PERSONA AVATARS ARE EVOLVING FAST (10 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Apple Vision Pro's most compelling feature is the realistic
"Persona," a 3D avatar of the user created through a scan using
Gaussian splatting. 

 BY THE POWER OF GRAYSCALE! (24 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The Grayskull library is a minimal computer vision toolkit written in
C that uses grayscale images and fundamental algorithms to perform
image processing tasks like filtering, thresholding, blob detection,
keypoint detection, and object detection using LBP cascades. 

 CHAINING FFMPEG WITH A BROWSER AGENT (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 By integrating FFmpeg as a WebAssembly module within a browser agent,
complex media processing can be executed serverlessly and statelessly
within a workflow, turning FFmpeg into a composable API accessible as
a single step. 

 FULL TEXT SEARCH SHENANIGANS (9 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Bloom filters can be used for full-text search, but only for very
small document sets, as the technique's lack of information sharing
between filters makes it less scalable.
