 HOW X DECIDES WHAT 550 MILLION USERS SEE (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 X's feed algorithm, which determines what 550 million users see
through a component-based pipeline, was recently open-sourced. The
pipeline has sources like Thunder (for in-network posts) and Phoenix
(for discovery), which feed candidates into a system of hydrators,
filters, and multi-stage scorers. Posts are evaluated based on
eighteen predicted engagement probabilities, weighted, and adjusted
for author diversity and whether they are from followed accounts. 

 WE FIXED A 6-YEAR-OLD JAVASCRIPT MEMORY LEAK (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 DebugBear fixed a 6-year-old memory leak in its Google Cloud
Functions caused by lodash's `memoize` caching all data indefinitely
without clearing it. The leak only showed up with thousands of unique
URLs in production, not in local testing with repeated URLs, so the
company just lived with occasional crashes and auto-retries.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE 80% PROBLEM IN AGENTIC CODING (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many engineers now use AI agents to write 80-100% of their code,
transforming their role from direct implementers to orchestrators.
This adoption has introduced new problems, such as conceptual AI
errors, comprehension debt within codebases, and a productivity
paradox where review times balloon. Engineers need to shift to a
declarative approach, focusing on problem definition and architectural
oversight. 

 DON'T SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT DON'T EXIST (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 People frequently waste time solving problems that don't exist,
driven by procrastination, unclear next steps, and a subconscious
avoidance of discomfort. This tendency is made worse by Parkinson's
Law and an aversion to high-uncertainty tasks.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 THE NEW ERA OF BROWSING: PUTTING GEMINI TO WORK IN CHROME (7 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Google is integrating major Gemini AI updates into Chrome, including
a new side panel for multitasking across tabs and deeper integrations
with other Google apps like Gmail and Calendar. For AI Pro and Ultra
subscribers, Chrome now has "auto browse," an agentic feature that
automatically browses the web to handle complex multi-step tasks such
as vacation planning, online forms, and smart shopping. 

 INTRODUCING LIBPDF: THE PDF LIBRARY TYPESCRIPT DESERVES (6 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 LibPDF is a new TypeScript-first document parsing library that
supports lenient parsing, native digital signature support
(eliminating complex workarounds like Rust bindings), and incremental
saves vital for multi-party signing workflows. 

 INTRODUCING RELICSS: A TOOL FOR FRONT-END ARCHAEOLOGY (4 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 ReliCSS is a browser-based tool designed to scan CSS and identify
"browser hacks" and historical artifacts. It parses CSS, highlights
these findings with severity levels, and suggests ways to modernize or
remove them.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SUSPICIOUSLY PRECISE FLOATS, OR, HOW I GOT CLAUDE'S REAL LIMITS (11
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This dev reverse-engineered Claude's hidden usage limits and internal
credit system by analyzing unrounded float values from the API.
Findings show the 5x subscription plan has amazing value, providing
much more usage (up to 8 times weekly) than advertised, while the 20x
plan is less efficient for weekly tasks. Subscription plans are always
superior to API pricing, mainly due to free cache reads and discounted
cache writes. 

 ADDING DYNAMIC FEATURES TO AN AGGRESSIVELY CACHED WEBSITE (6 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 This dev implemented dynamic features on his aggressively cached
website, which uses Cloudflare with a 15-minute cache header. He used
localStorage and client-side JavaScript for features that bypass
full-page caching. Examples include "Edit" links visible only to the
administrator based on a `localStorage` key, and a "Random" button for
navigating posts within a specific tag.

 AMAZON AXES 16,000 JOBS AS IT PUSHES AI AND EFFICIENCY (7 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Amazon has confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts, completing a plan for
approximately 30,000 total reductions, as it streamlines operations,
shuts down underperforming businesses, and embraces AI. 

 INTRODUCING LM STUDIO 0.4.0 (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 LM Studio 0.4, used to run AI locally on your computer, introduces a
server-native daemon for headless deployment, parallel inference for
high throughput, a new stateful REST API, and a refreshed user
interface. 

 A VERIFICATION LAYER FOR BROWSER AGENTS: AMAZON CASE STUDY (9 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Small local AI models are viable for executing browser tasks by using
structured snapshots and explicit assertions as a verification layer. 

 FROM MICROSOFT TO MICROSLOP TO LINUX: WHY I MADE THE SWITCH (14
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A long-time Windows user made a reluctant but ultimately successful
switch to Linux due to Windows adding more ads and bugs into the user
experience.
