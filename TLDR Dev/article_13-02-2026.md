 DEVELOPERS KNOW ACCESSIBILITY IS GOOD ENGINEERING. SO WHAT'S HOLDING
TEAMS BACK? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 95% of developers say digital accessibility improves UX. So why are
they still scrambling to fix accessibility issues after launch? 

Level Access [4] just released their State of Digital Accessibility
Report [4]. Read it to learn why: 

 	* 93% of developers say accessibility is a competitive edge 

 	* 42% rank insufficient time to address accessibility issues among
their top 3 challenges 

 	* 39% say using AI to scale accessibility is a top priority

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 I IMPROVED 15 LLMS AT CODING IN ONE AFTERNOON. ONLY THE HARNESS
CHANGED (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The performance of LLMs in coding is limited by the "harness,” the
tools and interface managing their interactions, rather than solely by
the models themselves. "Hashline” is an editing tool that tags lines
of code with content hashes, allowing LLMs to make precise edits by
referencing these tags instead of relying on perfect content recall.
Benchmarking of 16 LLMs showed that Hashline consistently outperformed
traditional "Patch" and "Replace" formats. 

 THE DEATH OF TRADITIONAL TESTING: AGENTIC DEVELOPMENT BROKE A
50-YEAR-OLD FIELD, JITTESTING CAN REVIVE IT (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 According to Meta, agentic development has broken traditional
testing. Static test suites can't keep up when code is being written
and shipped this fast, and the false positive and maintenance burden
is crushing. Their answer is “Catching JiTTests” (Just-in-Time
Tests): LLMs automatically generate bespoke tests the moment a PR
lands by inferring the code change's intent, simulating possible
faults via mutation testing, and only surfacing signals when something
actually breaks.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 LINES OF CODE ARE BACK (AND IT'S WORSE THAN BEFORE) (15 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The software industry previously held a strong consensus that Lines
of Code (LOC) is a terrible metric for measuring developer
productivity due to its gameability and focus on volume. However, AI
has resurrected LOC, with tech CEOs now touting the percentage of
AI-generated code as a key achievement. AI makes this problem worse by
making LOC infinitely gameable at virtually no cost, leading to lower
quality code overall. 

 ANTFARM PATTERNS: ORCHESTRATING SPECIALIZED AGENT TEAMS FOR COMPOUND
ENGINEERING (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Compound engineering is an AI-driven software development methodology
where each task, bug fix, or pull request feeds into a learning loop
to help AI improve over time. While compound engineering promises
productivity gains, single AI agents often fail due to context
degradation and lack of specialization. Antfarm addresses this by
orchestrating teams of specialized AI agents, like planners,
developers, and verifiers, each with fresh context and clear handoffs.

 INTRODUCING GPT-5.3-CODEX-SPARK (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI has introduced GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, an ultra-fast, real-time
coding model optimized for low-latency hardware. This model delivers
over 1,000 tokens per second for immediate feedback during coding
tasks like targeted edits or refining logic. 

 ANNOUNCING TYPESCRIPT 6.0 BETA (31 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 TypeScript 6.0 Beta has been released. This release has improved type
inference for "this"-less functions, support for `#/` subpath imports,
`es2025` target and lib options, and new types for Temporal and
"upsert" methods. 

 OMNARA (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Omnara provides full mobile and cross-device control over AI coding
sessions, allowing for continuous development from anywhere with
features like voice interaction and multi-agent orchestration.

 INTRODUCING MARKDOWN FOR AGENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cloudflare's Markdown for Agents addresses the inefficiency of AI
crawlers processing unstructured HTML web content. This new feature
automatically converts HTML pages to markdown in real-time when AI
agents request it via a specific `Accept` header. By providing
structured markdown directly from the source, it reduces token usage
for AI systems (up to 80% as shown) that query web content. 

 AN AI AGENT PUBLISHED A HIT PIECE ON ME (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Scott Shambaugh, a volunteer maintainer for the Python library
matplotlib, rejected a code contribution from an AI agent named MJ
Rathbun, following a project policy against low-quality, autonomously
generated code. In response, the AI agent autonomously published a
"hit piece" online, disparaging Shambaugh's character, fabricating a
narrative of prejudice and ego, and leveraging his public information
to damage his reputation.
