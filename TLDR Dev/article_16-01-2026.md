ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION OF SPRITES (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Sprites is a platform of Linux virtual machines. These Sprites offer
instant creation (1-2 seconds), root access, 100GB of durable storage,
and automatically sleep during inactivity. Their unique capabilities
come from certain design decisions: eliminating user-facing container
images, using S3-compatible object storage for persistent disks, and
using an "inside-out orchestration" model where much of the management
occurs within the VM itself. 

 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO CLAUDE.MD (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CLAUDE.md files are markdown files that Claude automatically reads at
the start of each coding session to understand project-specific
instructions, conventions, and workflows. They need to be maintained
over time to avoid repeating setup instructions in every conversation.
Other features include importing other files with `@imports`, using
modular rule files in `.claude/rules/` directories, and placing
CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories for more complex project structures.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHEN THE RIGHT CALL IS TO STOP THE WORK (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Good leadership sometimes requires intervening and forcing team
members to take a rest to prevent burnout. Prioritizing early rest is
necessary for sustained performance and retaining talent. 

 WEB DEPENDENCIES ARE BROKEN. CAN WE FIX THEM? (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The web platform has a broken dependency management system that
forces developers to use complex bundlers for basic tasks like
importing libraries. Dependency management should be decoupled from
bundling and be made a first-class feature of the web platform itself.


 HOW WE BUILT AN AI-FIRST CULTURE AT ABLY (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ably built an AI-first culture through a company-wide mandate
requiring all employees to explore AI's potential to improve their
effectiveness. Its approach focused on three pillars: internal AI
adoption across all teams, improving developer experience through AI
tools, and AI product enhancement based on real customer needs. Using
MCPs was a key breakthrough.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AI CODE REVIEW WITH COMMENTS YOU'LL ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Unblocked [9] is the AI code review that surfaces real issues and
meaningful feedback instead of flooding your PRs with stylistic
nitpicks and low-value comments.

“_Unblocked made me reconsider my AI fatigue. Finally, a tool that
surfaces context only someone with a full view of the codebase could
provide._” - Senior developer, Clio

 PUCK (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Puck is a modular, open-source visual editor for React apps. It
supports custom drag-and-drop content experiences using existing React
components. As a simple React component, Puck integrates seamlessly
into any React environment. 

 GAMBIT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Gambit is an agent harness framework for building LLM workflows by
creating small, typed "decks" with clear inputs, outputs, and
guardrails. It fixes brittle orchestration, untyped I/O, excessive
context, and difficult debugging by allowing a mix of LLM and compute
tasks with localized logic.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BEYOND SENIOR: CONSIDER THE STAFF PATH! (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Staff Software Engineer role is a "beyond terminal" level that
involves a broader scope across multiple teams or deeper technical
expertise. The various archetypes of it include Tech Lead, Architect,
Solver, or a leader's Right Hand. Getting to this level typically
involves leading impactful projects that address large business needs.


 HOW TO THINK ABOUT GAS TOWN (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Gas Town uses AI agents to autonomously complete software tasks from
a bug tracker. While the underlying concept of AI-driven development
is inevitable, the project intentionally uses "weird" terminology to
filter for like-minded, experimental individuals. 

 8 LESSONS FROM TECH LEADERSHIP ON SCALING TEAMS AND AI (11 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Most companies jump into AI without realizing their data is a mess,
and developers are increasingly skeptical (only a third actually trust
AI output now).

real-world systems for building and deploying reliable AI agents.
