 CLERK'S NEXT.JS SETUP NOW WORKS DIRECTLY IN YOUR AI ASSISTANT
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you use Cursor, Claude, or ChatGPT for coding, you can now add
authentication without leaving your workflow. Our quickstart [4]
includes a pre-built prompt that guides your AI through the complete
setup: SDK installation, middleware configuration, and component
integration. Click to open the prompt directly in your assistant, or
copy it manually. Either way, you get working authentication without
switching between docs and your editor.

 MODERNIZING REDDIT'S COMMENT BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Reddit's infrastructure organization aims to deliver reliability and
performance with a modern tech stack, which involves completely
getting rid of its Python monoliths. It has four core models:
Comments, Accounts, Posts, and Subreddits. Comments and Accounts have
now been fully migrated from Reddit's Python monolith to
domain-specific Go microservices. This post looks at how Reddit's team
performed the migration and the lessons learned along the way. 

 HOW WE DEBUG 1,000S OF DATABASES WITH AI AT DATABRICKS (14 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Databricks has developed an AI-assisted platform to debug its
thousands of databases across multiple cloud environments. This
platform unifies metrics, tooling, and expert knowledge, letting
engineers quickly diagnose and resolve database issues using natural
language queries. The AI agent automates tasks like retrieving logs
and correlating signals, resulting in up to a 90% reduction in
debugging time and a faster onboarding process for new engineers. 

 GETTING FROM TESTED TO BATTLE-TESTED (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Testing is essential when building reliable software. Being able to
show that your code is correct and resilient can be hard, and it takes
time to write good tests. In a non-trivial system, tests are an
approximation at best, as the real world is messy. Going from being
tested to being battle-tested requires learning some things that can
only be learned through experience.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 MY FAVORITE PRINCIPLE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 "Levo's Principle" states that an object's behavior should remain
constant after construction to improve code clarity, reduce bugs, and
simplify refactoring. The main exception to this rule applies to
procedural-style objects like stream parsers, where behavior changes
are inherent to the object's purpose. 

 SHOULD CSS BE CONSTRAINTS? (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CSS layout rules are complex and hard to pick up just from examples.
One commonly-proposed replacement for CSS is a constraint system.
Rule-based systems can be complex and hard to predict, but it is
almost impossible to create a layout that is not under- or
over-determined. A better way to improve CSS would be to provide more
intuitive rule systems with more predictable, less esoteric rules.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TURN YOUR LOVABLE PROTOTYPES INTO A COLLABORATIVE STARTING POINT WITH
ATLASSIAN (SPONSOR) [10] 

 A prototype is worth a thousand words — and with Lovable and
Atlassian, you have a clear path from vibe-coded prototype to working
code. In this session [10], Atlassian and Lovable will demonstrate how
Teamwork Collection, Rovo Dev, and Lovable make collaboration easier.
See what you can create, watch the session [10]. 

 NEW NPM PACKAGE FOR AUTOMATIC RECOVERY OF BROKEN STREAMING MARKDOWN
(1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Remend is a standalone package that brings intelligent incomplete
Markdown handling to any application. It automatically detects and
completes unterminated Markdown blocks to ensure clean, stable output
during streaming. Remend works with any Markdown renderer as a
pre-processor. It follows intelligent rules to avoid false positives
and can handle complex edge cases. 

 FRESH (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Fresh is a terminal text editor with features like a menu system,
command palette, and full mouse support.  It's extensible with
TypeScript plugins that run in a sandboxed Deno environment. Fresh has
near-zero latency and can reliably handle multi-gigabyte files.

enabling widespread HTTPS adoption. Born out of the Let's Encrypt
project, ACME allows client software to automatically prove domain
control to certificate authorities.
