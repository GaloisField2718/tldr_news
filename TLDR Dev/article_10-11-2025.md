 CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED TESTING
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW DID I GET HERE? (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This website uses a custom traceroute program called ktr to visualize
the journey of internet packets between the server and your IP
address. The traceroute works by sending ICMP packets with increasing
TTLs to map the routers and networks (autonomous systems) involved.
These networks peer with each other using the Border Gateway Protocol
to exchange routing information and determine the best path for data
transmission. 

 INSIDE MODAL NOTEBOOKS: HOW WE BUILT A CLOUD GPU NOTEBOOK THAT BOOTS
IN SECONDS (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Modal Notebooks are a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that
offers fast GPU access and real-time collaboration. Engineering-wise,
the notebooks use sandboxes for safe kernel execution, lazy-load
container images for quick startup, and VolumeFS for persistent data
storage. 

 WHY IS ZIG SO COOL? (25 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Zig is a programming language that is great at compiling C code and
cross-compiling to different architectures, setting it apart from
other languages. This is a beginner-friendly guide to Zig that covers
variable declarations, structs, loops, arrays, pointers, functions,
and object-oriented programming concepts.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DEAD FRAMEWORK THEORY (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 React's dominance is self-reinforcing due to LLMs favoring it in code
generation, creating a barrier for new frameworks, libraries, and web
platform features. This is because LLMs are trained on existing data,
where React is statistically dominant, and tools are incentivized to
output React to meet developer demand. 

 STARTUP LESSONS FROM MY PIRACY WEBSITE (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This author fostered a loyal user base while running the piracy
streaming site HeheStreams through prioritizing customer service,
personalized communication, and honest recommendations. A key growth
strategy involved using Reddit's API to encourage user referrals in
relevant online communities. These principles apply to all businesses,
except in this case, the author went to jail since the site itself was
illegal. 

 BECOMING A COMPILER ENGINEER (13 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Compiler engineers implement programming languages, focusing on
optimization and maintenance rather than language creation. The job
market is competitive due to limited demand and high entry barriers,
with opportunities in startups, larger tech companies, academia, and
quant finance. Interviews for compiler engineers usually have
questions on LeetCode-style data structures and algorithms (in C++),
language design, intermediate representation, and compiler
optimization passes.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AI PROTOTYPING FOR PRODUCT LEADERS (SPONSOR) [15] 

 Assessing AI prototyping isn't just about "which tool is best?" It's
"what helps make confident decisions fastest?" Miro's guide [15]
provides a FRAMEWORK + SCORECARD so you can commit resources
confidently — plus a method for turning early ideas into editable
prototypes, before committing to code. Get the guide [15]. 

 VALDI (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework developed by Snapchat designed
to deliver native performance without sacrificing developer speed. It
allows developers to write UI code once in TypeScript, which is then
compiled directly into native views for iOS, Android, and macOS. Valdi
has automatic view recycling, optimized component rendering, and a C++
layout engine for better performance. 

 MARKOJS (WEBSITE) [17] 

 Marko is a declarative, HTML-based language that extends standard
HTML to enable building dynamic and reactive user interfaces. It
prioritizes performance with features like streaming, an optimizing
compiler, and granular hydration. 

 RIBIR (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 Ribir is a non-intrusive Rust GUI framework that enables building
cross-platform applications from a single codebase. The framework has
a declarative language using Rust macros, a widget composition system,
a layout system inspired by Flutter, and a theme system.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LEAVING META AND PYTORCH (8 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 After eleven years at Meta, including nearly eight years working on
PyTorch, which he co-founded, Soumith Chintala is leaving to pursue
something new and smaller, driven by curiosity and the desire to avoid
regret. He's confident in PyTorch's future, as a capable and
value-aligned team is in place to guide its continued evolution. 

 AI ISN'T REPLACING JOBS. AI SPENDING IS (6 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Despite claims of AI-driven job displacement, AI is not the primary
cause of recent layoffs. Tech sector layoffs are more likely due to
factors like over-hiring during the pandemic and financial stress from
massive AI infrastructure spending that isn't generating enough
revenue. Companies are using AI as a convenient excuse for
cost-cutting measures when faced with financial pressures.

 REVERSE ENGINEERING CODEX CLI TO GET GPT-5-CODEX-MINI TO DRAW ME A
PELICAN (8 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 OpenAI's open-source Codex CLI tool was reverse-engineered using
Codex itself to create a command that allows direct prompting of the
GPT-5-Codex-Mini model, ultimately getting it to (poorly) generate an
SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle and uncovering the API endpoint used
by the tool. 

 FROM WEB DEVELOPER TO DATABASE DEVELOPER IN 10 YEARS (6 MINUTE READ)
[22] 

 After years as a web developer and manager, the author transitioned
to a database developer role at EnterpriseDB by pursuing side
projects, community involvement, and networking, landing a position
focused on Postgres extensions. 

 WORK, AFTER WORK: NOTES FROM AN UNEMPLOYED NEW GRAD WATCHING THE JOB
MARKET BREAK (19 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 A new computer science graduate describes the current job market as
broken due to automation and the rise of AI, which are thinning out
entry-level positions and pressuring individuals to become exceptional
"out of distribution humans" to compete with AI. 

 APPLE IS CROSSING A STEVE JOBS RED LINE (4 MINUTE READ) [24] 

 Apple, under Tim Cook, is betraying Steve Jobs' core principle of
prioritizing customer experience over profit by introducing
advertising into its products like Apple Maps and the App Store.
