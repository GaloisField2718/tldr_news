 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

QA Wolf [5] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs for mobile and web apps
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes guarantee

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [6] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 AGENTS 2.0: FROM SHALLOW LOOPS TO DEEP AGENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Shallow agents use simple while loops and rely on context windows for
memory, making them great for simple 5-15 step tasks but prone to
failure on complex multi-step problems due to context overflow and
loss of focus. Deep Agents address these limitations through four
architectural improvements: explicit planning with maintained to-do
lists, hierarchical delegation to specialized sub-agents, persistent
external memory storage, and detailed context engineering with
comprehensive instructions. 

 IS POSTGRES READ HEAVY OR WRITE HEAVY? (AND WHY YOU SHOULD YOU CARE)
(10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Determining if a Postgres database is read-heavy or write-heavy is
necessary for performance tuning and resource allocation. Read-heavy
databases benefit from caching and indexing, while write-heavy
databases need faster storage and optimized WAL management. 

 LAZY FIELDS FOR 30X SPEEDUP WITHOUT DECORATORS OR TRANSFORMS (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Joist TypeScript ORM achieved a 30x performance speedup by making
class fields lazy without using decorators or transforms. It used
`Object.create()` to skip constructor field initialization and moved
relations to the prototype, allowing relations to only be created when
actually accessed rather than eagerly initializing all relations for
every instance. This approach reduced memory allocation costs,
especially for entities with many relations (30+ in some cases).

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE GREAT SOFTWARE QUALITY COLLAPSE: HOW WE NORMALIZED CATASTROPHE
(14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Software quality is collapsing. The author cites examples like a
calculator app leaking 32GB of RAM and AI-generated code containing
many more vulnerabilities than human-generated code. Big Tech's
response is to spend billions on infrastructure instead of addressing
underlying engineering issues. 

 THE ACCOUNTABILITY PROBLEM (53 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 In software development, business partners often misunderstand the
iterative nature of software creation and impose unrealistic,
project-based governance. To bridge this gap, software departments
should focus on delivering demonstrable business results, similar to
other departments like Sales or Marketing, by creating new
opportunities. An example of this is taking on "Product Bets,” which
are strategic investments summarized by a business outcome, a sponsor,
an estimated present value, and a maximum wager. 

 SQL ANTI-PATTERNS YOU SHOULD AVOID (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Some common SQL anti-patterns include mishandling CASE WHEN
statements, using functions on indexed columns, overusing DISTINCT,
excessive view layer stacking, using SELECT * in views, and using
nested subqueries. Treating SQL like production code, including
reviewing and optimizing, can prevent these issues and improve data
trust.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW DO YOU UNLOCK AGENTIC ENGINEERING? (SPONSOR) [14] 

 You need a deep, rich, real-time context lake. You need guardrails.
And you need a human-to-agent collaboration experience. 

You need agentic harmony. Successfully orchestrate AI across your SDLC
with Port's agentic engineering platform [14]. 👉Book a demo [15]

 DUCKUI (WEBSITE) [16] 

 Duck-UI is a web interface for the DuckDB database that runs entirely
in your browser using WebAssembly. It allows users to run SQL queries,
import various data formats, and connect to remote DuckDB servers. It
includes a SQL editor with advanced features, data exploration tools,
persistent storage via OPFS, and a focus on speed and privacy. 

 FLOWISTRY (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Flowistry is a VSCode plugin for Rust that analyzes information flow
to help devs focus on relevant code. By fading out irrelevant code,
Flowistry allows users to understand the impact of specific variables
or expressions, making it easier to comprehend complex functions.

 LEADING OPENAI RESEARCHER ANNOUNCED A GPT-5 MATH BREAKTHROUGH THAT
NEVER HAPPENED (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenAI researchers initially claimed a major math breakthrough by
GPT-5, suggesting it had solved previously unsolved Erdős problems.
However, mathematician Thomas Bloom clarified that the problems were
not truly unsolved, and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis criticized the
announcement as misleading. The researchers later retracted their
claims, admitting their mistake and deleting the original tweets. 

 STOP IGNORING THE BROWSER: THE BIGGEST FRONTEND SHIFT IN A DECADE (8
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Developers are returning to using native browser capabilities rather
than relying heavily on complex JavaScript frameworks and build tools.
This "back to the browser" movement uses built-in web APIs, native
features, and simpler architectures that work directly with what
browsers already provide. 

 GRAPHQL MYTHS (7 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This article debunks three common GraphQL myths: that it only uses
POST requests, forces everything through a single `/graphql` endpoint,
and allows dangerous arbitrary queries from users. These issues come
from default configurations rather than inherent GraphQL limitations.
Persisted operations (where queries are pre-registered and referenced
by hash) solve all three problems by enabling GET requests, creating
meaningful URLs, and restricting queries to a trusted allowlist.

QUICK LINKS

 I WISH SSDS GAVE YOU CPU PERFORMANCE STYLE METRICS ABOUT THEIR
ACTIVITY (3 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 It would be great if SSDs could provide CPU-like performance metrics
(e.g., erase counts, stall times) to better understand drive behavior
and optimize performance, particularly in write-heavy workloads, even
though some information is already available through SMART attributes.


 RSS IS STILL PRETTY GREAT (9 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 RSS feeds are still a valuable tool for consuming high-quality
information with minimal distractions, even though it doesn't have
analytics, social interaction, and have limitations in content
rendering and discoverability. 

 FIND WHERE A SPECIFIC OBJECT WAS ALLOCATED IN JAVASCRIPT WITH
DEVTOOLS (2 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 There's a trick using Chrome DevTools' memory profiler to find the
allocation point of a specific JavaScript object where you
intentionally leak it as a global variable with a unique class name
during debugging. 

 THE MAJORITY AI VIEW (5 MINUTE READ) [24] 

 Despite the hype surrounding AI, many tech workers view it as a
useful but overblown technology compared to the hype that shouldn't be
forced everywhere.
