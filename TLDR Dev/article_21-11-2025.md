 SHIP FASTER WITHOUT FLAKY PLAYWRIGHT TESTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If your team spends more time nursing brittle Playwright tests than
shipping features, you should check out Momentic.

Turn plain-English descriptions of your critical flows into AI-native
end-to-end tests [4] that adapt when the UI changes. No brittle
selectors, no custom test code to maintain.

With Momentic [4] you can:

 	* Catch regressions on every PR and deploy
 	* Cut hours of test maintenance each week
 	* Give engineers reliable signal before every release

The result? Quora's product operations team [5] took Poe's daily QA
cycle from 14 hours down to 30 minutes, A 14X SPEEDUP.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BRUTE-FORCEABLE AIRLINE RESERVATION API LEFT MILLIONS OF PASSENGER
RECORDS VULNERABLE (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A security researcher discovered a vulnerability in Avelo Airline's
reservation API that allowed unauthorized access to passenger data
through a brute-force attack due to the lack of last name verification
and rate limiting. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could have
potentially accessed millions of passenger records, including PII,
government ID numbers, and partial payment data, within a few hours.
The researcher responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to Avelo on
October 15, who quickly responded and patched the issues by November
13. 

 OPTIMIZING RUBY PERFORMANCE: OBSERVATIONS FROM THOUSANDS OF
REAL-WORLD SERVICES (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Based on analysis of over 3,000 real-world Ruby services, Datadog
found that Ruby applications spend 82% of their CPU time in library
code, making careful library selection necessary for performance
optimization. Upgrading from Ruby 2 to Ruby 3 (with YJIT enabled)
reduces CPU usage, while some popular libraries like mysql2 can be
replaced with more efficient alternatives like trilogy for performance
gains. 

 CODE EXECUTION WITH MCP: BUILDING MORE EFFICIENT AI AGENTS (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 MCP allows AI agents to connect to external systems, but as agents
scale to use hundreds or thousands of tools, loading all tool
definitions upfront and passing intermediate results through the
context window creates inefficiencies and increased costs. By using
code execution environments where agents write code to interact with
MCP servers as APIs rather than making direct tool calls, agents can
load only needed tools on-demand, process data locally before
returning results to the model, and reduce token usage by up to 98.7%.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WE ARE REPLACING OOP WITH SOMETHING WORSE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OOP is not disappearing but shifting into new domains like
microservices and distributed systems. The core principle of OOP,
information attenuation and separation of concerns, is now being
applied at the process and network level. This shift replaces OOP with
a more cumbersome and complex system characterized by microservices,
Docker, and Kubernetes. 

 WHY TOP FIRMS PARADOXICALLY FIRE GOOD WORKERS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Elite firms often hire top talent, train them extensively, and then
let many go after a few years. This "up-or-out" system isn't a flaw
but a strategic way for firms to signal talent and boost profits by
creating a reputation for excellence. By periodically churning
employees, firms maintain a perceived higher quality, allowing them to
underpay those who remain while benefiting from their association with
the prestigious firm.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT ARCHITECTURE FOR ENTERPRISE SSO AND SCIM
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Enterprise customers are asking, “Can we use Okta to log in?” or
“how about syncing user groups from Entra?” What they're actually
asking for is Enterprise SSO and SCIM [11]. But to implement them
successfully, you need to make _a lot_ of architectural decisions.

 INTRODUCING NANO BANANA PRO (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google DeepMind has launched Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image), a
state-of-the-art image generation and editing model built on Gemini 3
Pro. This new model improves image creation through improved
reasoning, world knowledge, and real-time information integration.
Nano Banana Pro allows users to generate accurate visuals with legible
text, maintain consistency across multiple elements in complex
compositions, and apply studio-quality creative controls like
adjusting lighting and focus. 

 CC SWITCH (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 CC-Switch is a cross-platform desktop application for managing and
switching between Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini API configurations.
It supports MCP integration, API speed testing, config import/export,
and multiple languages.

 AI SLOP SECURITY ENGINEERING: OKTA'S NEXTJS-0AUTH TROUBLES (5 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Joshua Rogers reported a security vulnerability in Okta's
auth0/nextjs-auth0 project and submitted a patch. However, the
maintainer used AI to rebase the commit, resulting in incorrect
attribution and the removal of Rogers' contribution history. The
maintainer then used AI to apologize for the error and refused to
correct the commit, despite Rogers' request. 

 READONLY CHARACTERS ARE A BIG DEAL (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Read-only characters in text editors help create interactive
applications. Emacs allows marking specific substrings as read-only,
enabling bidirectional interaction where both the user and the editor
can modify different parts of the text. This contrasts with VS Code,
where the lack of this feature hurts the creation of similar
interactive tools.

QUICK LINKS

 ANDROID AND IPHONE USERS CAN NOW SHARE FILES, STARTING WITH THE PIXEL
10 FAMILY. (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Quick Share on Android will now work with AirDrop, making file
sharing easier between Android (starting with the Pixel 10 family) and
iPhone devices. 

 SIX THINGS I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DO WITH CHROME'S DEVTOOLS
(4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Some lesser-known Chrome Devtools features include `console.time()`
functions, DOM element change monitoring, and being able to attach
listeners to any function with `monitor`. 

 PARETO PRINCIPLE: THE SIGNIFICANT 20% (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 20% of bugs often result in 80% of the total failures. 

 PRESERVING CODE THAT SHAPED GENERATIONS: ZORK I, II, AND III GO OPEN
SOURCE (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Microsoft, in collaboration with Team Xbox and Activision, is
open-sourcing the code for Zork I, II, and III under the MIT License
to preserve gaming history and provide a valuable resource for
education and exploration.
