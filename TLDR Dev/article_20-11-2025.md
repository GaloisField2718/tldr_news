ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE $1,000 AWS MISTAKE (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Geocodio, a geocoding service, experienced a $1,000 AWS bill due to
unexpected data transfer charges through a NAT Gateway when syncing
data to S3. The team learned that traffic between EC2 and S3, even
within the same region, can route through the NAT Gateway and incur
costs. The solution was to implement VPC Gateway Endpoints for S3,
which provide a free, direct route, bypassing the NAT Gateway. 

 PARTIAL PRERENDERING (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Next.js's Partial Prerendering (PPR) is a new rendering paradigm that
optimizes performance by serving static parts of a page immediately
while allowing dynamic components that need request data to render on
the server. The first implementation in Next.js 14 used error throwing
to detect request data access, but this caused issues with existing
applications that had try/catch blocks and retry logic. The updated
approach in Next.js 15 switches to a Promise-based system where
request APIs like `cookies()` and `headers()` become asynchronous and
return never-resolving promises during prerendering.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 JUST JAVASCRIPT (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 "Just JavaScript" is code that works without custom transforms,
allowing devs to understand and refactor their code easily. Svelte and
React are not "just JavaScript" due to their unique
languages/semantics and custom transforms, respectively. However,
Remix 3 adheres to this principle. 

 WHY TRADITIONAL SAAS PLAYBOOKS FAIL FOR AI-NATIVE PRODUCTS (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Traditional SaaS go-to-market strategies don't work for AI-native
products. Unlike traditional SaaS, which focuses on perfect MVPs,
narrow customer profiles, and monetization-first approaches, AI-native
products require breaking these rules by launching imperfect products,
building viral distribution channels first, and targeting broader
early customer profiles who can provide feedback and social sharing.
AI-native companies must prioritize building "omnipresent"
distribution channels and momentum over traditional metrics like
product-market fit and willingness to pay. 

 WHAT AI IS REALLY FOR (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The AI boom is overhyped, potentially a bubble, and may not deliver
on its grand promises, especially in design. While AI can be useful in
small-scale applications, its implementation doesn't actually result
in as many savings as expected. Instead, the true motive behind the AI
frenzy is the acquisition of resources like land, energy, and water
needed to power massive data centers.

 CAN AI MODELS BE JAILBROKEN TO PHISH ELDERLY VICTIMS? AN END-TO-END
EVALUATION (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI can be used to scam elderly people. These journalists successfully
jailbroke AI models like Meta and Gemini to generate phishing emails,
which were then sent to elderly participants, resulting in 11% being
phished. The journalists also investigated real-world AI scam
factories in Southeast Asia and found that victims were using AI
chatbots to conduct scams. 

 AUTOMATED NPM SECRET ROTATION IN GITHUB ACTIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 NPM recently announced that all long-lived tokens are being revoked
and new tokens will only be valid for a maximum of 90 days, creating
challenges for automated publishing workflows. While the proper
solution is to upgrade to trusted publishing (OIDC), a tool called
"github-update-secret" automatically rotates secrets across all
repositories to buy time until each project can be properly migrated.
This tool iterates through all repositories with admin access and
updates any matching secret names with new values.
