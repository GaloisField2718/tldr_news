ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SPRINGS AND BOUNCES IN NATIVE CSS: THE MAGIC OF THE LINEAR() TIMING
FUNCTION (18 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The `linear()` CSS timing function is a powerful tool for creating
complex animations like springs and bounces natively. Unlike Bézier
curves, `linear()` allows you to define animation curves using a
series of points, allowing for more intricate and physics-based
effects. While `linear()` offers flexibility, it has limitations
regarding time-based durations, interrupt handling, and potential
performance concerns that can be mitigated by using CSS variables and
falling back to cubic-bezier curves for older browsers. 

 NAN, THE NOT-A-NUMBER NUMBER THAT ISN'T NAN (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 `NaN` results from mathematical operations involving non-numeric
values and propagates through calculations. It is unique because `NaN`
is not equal to itself, which prevents it from corrupting calculations
as an error state. The global `isNaN()` function coerces values to
numbers, while `Number.isNaN()` strictly checks for the `NaN` value. 

 NEW TREND: PROGRAMMING BY KICKING OFF PARALLEL AI AGENTS (7 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A new trend is forming where software engineers are experimenting
with running multiple AI agents in parallel to increase productivity.
While some engineers are skeptical, citing the need to review
AI-generated code as a bottleneck, others find it useful for tasks
like research and maintenance. Senior engineers may be well-suited to
this workflow due to their experience with multitasking and code
review, but established engineering practices are still important when
working with AI agents.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TAKING MONEY OFF THE TABLE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Startup employees facing a tender offer to sell a portion of their
equity should take it. Even successful startups can face unexpected
challenges, and the potential for having an immediate financial gain
already represents a "win." Having money makes it easier to make more
in the future, as one can take risks without worrying about money. 

 FREE SOFTWARE SCARES NORMAL PEOPLE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Free software often overwhelms non-technical users due to its complex
interfaces and extensive features. While powerful tools like Handbrake
exist, their "power user" UIs discourage normal people from using them
effectively for simple tasks like video conversion. A simplified
front-end can provide a user-friendly experience by focusing on the
most common needs. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AFFINITY STUDIO (WEBSITE) [9] 

 Affinity is a free, all-in-one creative app from Canva that combines
design, image editing, and layout tools. It has customizable studios,
non-destructive editing, and export capabilities, integrating with
various file formats. 

 A HEATMAP DIFF VIEWER FOR CODE REVIEWS (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This tool provides a heatmap diff viewer for code reviews,
highlighting lines and tokens based on their potential need for human
attention, not just for bugs but also for complexity or unusual
patterns. It uses GPT-5-Codex to analyze each diff and generate a JSON
data structure, which is then used to create a color-coded heatmap
overlayed on the code changes.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY WE TEND TO AVOID PUBLIC CONVERSATIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 People often default to private conversations instead of public ones,
despite advocating for transparency. This reluctance comes from the
perceived pressure of performing in public, the need for intimacy, the
burden of providing extensive context, and the vulnerability of
admitting ignorance. Some solutions to this are the "No DM Before
Public" rule, using "WIP" labels to encourage early feedback,
summarizing private decisions publicly, and leading by example by
openly asking questions and admitting mistakes. 

 COMPARING INTERVIEWS AT 8 LARGE TECH COMPANIES (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 An engineer interviewed at eight large tech companies before
accepting a Principal Software Engineer role at Atlassian. He
completed over 60 interviews and found that algorithmic coding skills
and behavioral interviews were still very important for senior-level
positions. Even in a challenging job market, strong candidates with
relevant experience are still in demand.

QUICK LINKS

 ZIG'S NEW ASYNC I/O (TEXT VERSION) (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Zig's new async I/O primitives, coming in version 0.16.0, have core
synchronization APIs like `async`, `await`, and `cancel` that will
help with asynchronous vs concurrent execution. 

 USING ATOMIC STATE TO IMPROVE REACT PERFORMANCE IN DEEPLY NESTED
COMPONENT TREES (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Harbor uses atomic state management with Jotai in its React-based
clinical trial data capture UI to improve performance in deeply nested
component trees by preventing unnecessary rerenders. 

 JOHN CARMACK ON VARIABLES (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Avoiding variable reassignment in Python, similar to the "const"
principle in C/C++, improves debugging and prevents errors caused by
code movement. 

 IMPROVING PERFORMANCE BY PREFETCHING PRODUCT PAGES FROM ETSY SEARCH
(15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Etsy improved the performance of product listing pages on its search
results by implementing the Speculation Rules API (SRA) to prefetch
those pages when users hover over listing cards, resulting in large
performance improvements (20-24% in some metrics).
