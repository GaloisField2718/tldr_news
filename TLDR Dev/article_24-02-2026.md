 WHY IS THERE ALWAYS A MEETING BOT IN YOUR ZOOM CALL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Blame Recall.ai [4].

They secretly power every meeting bot and desktop recording app, from
Cluely to Hubspot to Clickup.

Recall.ai [4] handles the hard part: getting clean recordings,
transcripts, and metadata across Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams,
in-person meetings, and more - so developers don't have to.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SPRITES ON THE WEB (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In 2015, Twitter used image sprites to create its animated "Like"
button, a technique borrowed from video games to run complex
animations on low-end devices. Sprites work by combining all frames of
an animation into a single image, called a spritesheet, then using CSS
properties like `object-fit: cover` and `object-position` within an
img tag to display each frame sequentially. The `steps()` timing
function in CSS is necessary for advancing through these frames
discretely, avoiding smooth transitions and creating a stop-motion
effect. 

 DICTIONARY COMPRESSION IS FINALLY HERE, AND IT'S RIDICULOUSLY GOOD
(25 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Dictionary compression is a newly widely supported technique for
sending data over the web. It works by initializing the compression
algorithm with a pre-shared dictionary of known data, allowing
subsequent transmissions to only send references to this dictionary
rather than the full content. This approach shrinks frequently updated
content like JavaScript bundles, WebAssembly files, and API responses.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WRITING CODE IS CHEAP NOW (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Agentic engineering changes software development by making code
writing cheaper. This shift impacts everything from macro-level
project planning to micro-level decisions about refactoring, testing,
and documentation. While delivering basic code is now nearly free,
delivering good code, defined by its quality, reliability, simplicity,
and maintainability, is still hard. 

 WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM SHIPPING 25+ MOBILE APPS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most Rails teams overestimate how much native code they actually
need. Most of what users do and need is standard CRUD that works great
as server-rendered HTML in a native wrapper. The apps that struggle
are the ones that go native too early on too many screens, tripling
their maintenance burden for no real user benefit. 

 IS AGE VERIFICATION A TRAP? (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Age-verification laws create an age-verification trap by having
platforms implement intrusive data collection practices that undermine
user privacy. To prove compliance, platforms must gather and
indefinitely store sensitive personal data, including government IDs,
biometric scans, and behavioral logs. This data retention directly
conflicts with modern privacy laws, which advocate for collecting only
necessary data for defined purposes and storing it minimally.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CREATE AN AGENT MVP IN 30 DAYS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Go from idea to production‐ready agent quickly. This developer
checklist [12] shows how to use Microsoft Foundry to build and ship an
agent MVP in ~30 days, with practical guidance on architecture,
performance, and tradeoffs to inform early technical decisions.

 PGDOG (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 PgDog is a high-performance proxy for PostgreSQL, written in Rust,
designed to scale databases by offering connection pooling, load
balancing, and advanced sharding capabilities. It parses SQL queries
to manage connections, distribute reads and writes, handle failovers,
and route queries across multiple shards. 

 INTRODUCING UPRIGHT: AN OPEN SOURCE SYNTHETIC MONITORING SYSTEM (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Upright is an open-source synthetic monitoring system built as a
Rails engine. It deploys to global VPS nodes via Kamal and conducts
various probes, including advanced Playwright browser checks, HTTP,
SMTP, and Traceroute, from multiple geographic locations.

 WHAT I LEARNED DESIGNING A (BAREBONES) UI ENGINE (8 MINUTE READ) [15]


 This dev created a custom UI framework in Python using PyGame. The
framework had a tree-based hierarchy, drawing inspiration from modern
UI engines to implement an automatic intrinsic layout system using
recursive `measure()` and `distribute()` methods. Further refinements
added features like asynchronous support, global event listeners,
performance optimizations via dirty flags, and a UI stage system for
navigation. 

 NODE.JS VS DENO VS BUN PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Bun won eight tests across 14 microbenchmarks on an M4 Mac
(especially HTTP throughput and large JSON parsing), Deno won five
(async scheduling and tight arithmetic), and Node won just one
(small-buffer SHA-256 hashing). Node stayed competitive overall but
didn't dominate anywhere. 

 SIGNALS: TOWARD A SELF-IMPROVING AGENT (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Factory built a system that uses LLMs to review thousands of coding
agent sessions daily, spotting where users got frustrated. For
example, frustrations would manifest themselves as rephrasing the same
request five times or fighting with context windows. When enough
friction is found, the agent files its own bug ticket, writes a fix,
and opens a PR for a human to approve.
