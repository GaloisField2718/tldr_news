 COLLABORATIVE AI FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MASTERCLASS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 On November 4-6, Miro will be running an exclusive masterclass series
[4]. Over 1,000 technical leaders have already signed up - save your
spot [4] for free access to all three sessions:

1️⃣ AI-DRIVEN PRODUCT DECISION-MAKING: See how AI surfaces
non-obvious pattern in product data and lets you connect customer
feedback to development priorities.

2️⃣ THE AI CANVAS: Get a practical AI workflow framework
applicable to development teams.

3️⃣ COLLABORATIVE AI PROTOTYPING: How to turn any content into a
testable prototype, and when you should use vibe coding.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 RSC: DO THEY REALLY IMPROVE PERFORMANCE? (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This performance analysis compared Client-Side Rendering, Server-Side
Rendering, and React Server Components using a semi-real app,
measuring metrics like LCP, data visibility, and interactivity gaps.
The key finding is that Server Components alone don't improve
performance in mixed client/server apps. The real benefits come from
Streaming and Suspense combined with server-first data fetching, which
achieved the best results (1.28s) but required a lot of refactoring
and careful Suspense boundary placement. 

 DESIGNING SOFTWARE FOR THINGS THAT ROT (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This dev wanted to upgrade his haphazard home fermentation system to
a more structured, data-driven approach. He built a fermentation
chamber with automated controls and a dashboard to track temperature
and humidity, but realized he needed more context to interpret the
data. So he developed an iOS app, Fermento, to track fermentation
projects, hazards, and critical control points, enabling traceability
over precision.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SIMPLIFY YOUR CODE: FUNCTIONAL CORE, IMPERATIVE SHELL (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The "Functional Core, Imperative Shell" pattern advocates for
separating code into two distinct parts to improve testability and
maintainability. The functional core contains pure business logic
without side effects, operating only on provided data. The imperative
shell handles side effects like database calls and email sending,
orchestrating the functional core. 

 I SEE A FUTURE IN JJ (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This dev is enthusiastic for the version control system, jj. jj has
product-market fit, a dedicated team, and a growing user base within
companies like Google, so it has potential for widespread adoption. 

 ONE YEAR WITH NEXT.JS APP ROUTER — WHY WE'RE MOVING ON (22 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Next.js's App Router and React Server Components don't have the
ability to perform optimistic updates and redundant data fetching. As
a result, this team migrated their frontend from Next.js to TanStack
Start, a move that simplified their code, improved performance, and
reduced costs.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 EVOLVING THE INTERNAL DEVELOPER PORTAL FOR THE AGE OF AGENTIC
ENGINEERING (SPONSOR) [10] 

 When you unleash AI into your SDLC without guardrails or workflows
that keep it in check, your engineering chaos turns into agentic
chaos. The internal developer portal needs to be reimagined [11] as an
agentic engineering enabler. Come build the future of software
engineering culture with Port [10]. 

 SOLITO V5 (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Solito 5, used to bridge the gap between React Native and Next.js,
drops the `react-native-web` dependency to embrace pure Next.js
components on the web for easier integration and customization. This
allows devs to use standard web props like `className` and `style`
directly on Solito components. The move towards web-first files aims
to simplify configuration for web consumers of React Native libraries.


 OPEN NOTEBOOK (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Open Notebook is an open-source alternative to Google's Notebook LM.
It allows users to control their data, choose from over 16 AI
providers, and organize multi-modal content for research. The platform
supports podcast generation, intelligent search, and context-aware AI
conversations. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE SECURITY PARADOX OF LOCAL LLMS (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Local LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can lead
to code vulnerabilities. Researchers discovered that smaller models
like gpt-oss-20b can be tricked into generating malicious code,
including backdoors and immediate remote code execution, with much
higher success rates compared to frontier models. These attacks
exploit the weaker reasoning and alignment capabilities of local
models, turning a developer's workflow into an attack chain. 

 OUR QUANTUM ECHOES ALGORITHM IS A BIG STEP TOWARD REAL-WORLD
APPLICATIONS FOR QUANTUM COMPUTING (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google Quantum AI has achieved a major breakthrough with its "Quantum
Echoes" algorithm, demonstrating the first verifiable quantum
advantage over classical supercomputers. The algorithm, run on the
Willow quantum chip, is 13,000 times faster than the best classical
algorithms in modeling molecular structures. This advancement allows
for more precise measurement of systems, from molecules to black
holes, and opens doors for applications in drug discovery and
materials science. 

 META IS AXING 600 ROLES ACROSS ITS AI DIVISION (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Meta is laying off 600 employees in its AI division, including the
FAIR team, while simultaneously hiring for its
superintelligence-focused TBD Lab.

QUICK LINKS

 SCRIPTS I WROTE THAT I USE ALL THE TIME (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This is a collection of frequently used shell scripts, categorized by
function (clipboard, file management, internet, text processing, REPL
launchers, dates/times, audio/video/pictures, process management,
quick references, system management, and grab bag), offering practical
solutions for tasks like clipboard management, file manipulation,
media handling, and system control. 

 REACT NATIVE MMKV 4.0 (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 React Native MMKV 4.0 is a major release featuring a full rewrite to
Nitro, native MMKVCore integration, improved error handling, new
features like useMMKVKeys(), and several bug fixes. 

 LOOKING AT BINARY TREES IN C++ (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This article goes over an alternative C++ binary tree implementation
using a vector of optionals and indices instead of raw pointers to
potentially improve cache efficiency. 

 REACT CONF 2025 RECAP (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The official recap of React Conf, which announced the React
Foundation, React Compiler v1.0, and React 19.2.
