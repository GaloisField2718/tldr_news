 COMMERCE APIS YOU CAN WORK WITH, NOT WORK AROUND (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Every commerce platform [4] promises flexibility. But when you want
to swap out search, change your checkout flow, or integrate with a new
ERP - then it's a six-month project 😭

Elastic Path [4] is built different. It's API-first and modular from
the ground up: catalog, cart, checkout, pricing, payments, promotions
– all separate services you can replace or extend.

✅ Includes the Composer iPaaS for drag-and-drop workflows and
pre-built connectors to SAP, Salesforce, Avalara, and 100s more

✅ AI baked in: semantic product search, shopper assistants,
prompt-based storefront creation

✅ Headless architecture for total frontend freedom

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY WE BUILT OUR OWN BACKGROUND AGENT (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Inspect is a custom background coding agent developed by Ramp that
autonomously writes, verifies, and debugs code with the same context
and tools a human engineer would use. The agent operates in fast,
sandboxed VMs with full development environments, integrates with many
existing tools, and supports interfaces like Slack, web, and Chrome
extensions. Inspect was adopted quickly internally, writing
approximately 30% of merged pull requests. 

 HOW A 40-LINE FIX ELIMINATED A 400X PERFORMANCE GAP (13 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 A method in OpenJDK on Linux previously suffered from a severe
30x-400x performance gap. The slower implementation was due to
standards requiring a less direct approach for user CPU time, unlike
the faster `clock_gettime()` function used for total CPU time. A
recent 40-line fix exploited an obscure yet stable Linux kernel detail
to enable `clock_gettime()` to directly retrieve user-time-only,
improving performance a lot. 

 REACT HAS FINALLY SOLVED ITS BIGGEST PROBLEM: THE JOYS OF
USEEFFECTEVENT (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 React has finally introduced the `useEffectEvent` Hook to solve its
biggest problem: infinite loops and stale closures caused by
`useEffect` dependency arrays. The hook provides a cleaner solution
than the traditional `useRef` workaround by allowing devs to access
current state values within effects without triggering re-runs when
those values change.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 NO MANAGEMENT NEEDED: ANTI-PATTERNS IN EARLY-STAGE ENGINEERING TEAMS
(9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 For early-stage founders facing engineering management issues, the
optimal solution is often to do nothing, focusing instead on building
the product and engaging with users. Attempting to actively "motivate"
engineers (who should be inherently motivated hires), hiring dedicated
managers prematurely, and copying complex management practices from
large companies like Google are the wrong things to do. 

 HOW THE HELL ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CAREER IN TECH IN 2026? (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The tech industry has had half a million workers laid off since
ChatGPT's release, despite billions in AI investments. Tech workers
need to understand their role within organizational systems rather
than just focusing on technical skills, recognizing that companies
increasingly view code and specific expertise as replaceable means to
an end.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DICER (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Dicer is Databricks' auto-sharder, a foundational infrastructure
system for building sharded services with low latency, high
availability, and cost efficiency at scale. It addresses the
inefficiencies of stateless models by colocating in-memory state with
computation, so there are no issues like network latency and
unnecessary data fetching. 

 SWARK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Swark is a free and open-source VS Code extension that automatically
generates architecture diagrams from code using LLMs. It integrates
directly with GitHub Copilot and outputs diagrams in the Mermaid.js
format.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPENCODE VS CLAUDE CODE (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenCode and Claude Code are both AI coding assistants that let you
chat with your codebase and run terminal commands. Claude Code offers
a polished, integrated experience locked to Anthropic's ecosystem,
while OpenCode is an open-source alternative supporting 75+ AI
providers. In head-to-head testing using the same model, Claude Code
was faster and more streamlined (9 minutes vs 16 minutes total), while
OpenCode was more thorough. 

 EVERY GITHUB OBJECT HAS TWO IDS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 When building a feature for Greptile, this dev encountered an issue
generating clickable GitHub links because their system stored GraphQL
`node IDs` (e.g., `PRRC_kw...`), while web URLs required integer
database IDs. Further investigation showed that GitHub uses two ID
formats: an older, string-based system for legacy objects and a newer,
more complex system for modern objects, despite inconsistent
application. 

 NPM TO IMPLEMENT STAGED PUBLISHING AFTER TURBULENT SHIFT OFF... (8
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 npm is implementing staged publishing, a new feature that will
introduce a review window before packages go live. This will require
MFA-verified approval from package owners to catch malicious changes
before they spread. This comes after the 2025 Shai-Hulud supply chain
attacks and a disruptive migration away from classic npm tokens in
December that caused workflow disruptions for maintainers.

QUICK LINKS

 CUT YOUR DEV LOOP FROM HOURS TO SECONDS (SPONSOR) [15] 

 Run your code locally with seamless access to everything in your
Kubernetes cluster. It's like testing in the cloud without the hassle
of actually deploying it there. Learn more about mirrord [15] 

 NOGIC (WEBSITE) [16] 

 Nogic is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps users visualize
their codebase structure with interactive diagrams. 

 MAKING AI GREAT AT FRONTEND (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Some clever AI prompting techniques can make the frontend output of
AI much better, such as sharing progressive references and using plan
mode. 

 USING PROXIES TO HIDE SECRETS FROM CLAUDE CODE (10 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Claude Code has security challenges, as its sandboxes can expose
sensitive data such as API keys through network access or environment
variables, but network proxies can be used to inject the actual API
keys in a safer manner. 

 WORK EXPANDS. TIME VANISHES. HERE'S WHY (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Parkinson's and Hofstadter's Laws say that work expands to fill
available time and always takes longer than expected, but this can be
somewhat mitigated with timeboxing and clearer definitions of the
work.
