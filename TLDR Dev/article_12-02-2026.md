ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 IT'S ABOUT TO GET A LOT EASIER FOR YOUR JAVASCRIPT TO CLEAN UP AFTER
ITSELF (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 JavaScript is getting a using keyword, the first new way to declare a
variable since const and let in 2015. It automatically cleans up
resources (file handles, connections, and streams) when they go out of
scope, so you don't have to remember to call close() or abort()
yourself. It already works in every major browser except Safari. 

 THE RECENT CVES IN REACT AND NODE.JS WERE FOUND BY AN AI (9 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 An AI system autonomously found real zero-days in Node.js and React,
such as a sandbox escape via Unix sockets and a DoS that could crash
any Next.js app, by performing a full security researcher workflow
without human help. LLM hallucination, usually a liability, turns into
a strength for imagining creative attack scenarios that traditional
scanners miss.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 "NOTHING" IS THE SECRET TO STRUCTURING YOUR WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Chaotic work environments, like cluttered desks or numerous open
tabs, hinder productivity and cause frustration. The "secret" to
better work isn't more organization, but rather starting with
"nothing,” a completely clear work surface. This clear surface is
for items needing immediate action, distinct from designated storage
areas. 

 CLAUDE CODE IS BEING DUMBED DOWN (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Claude Code version 2.1.20 shipped a change that replaced detailed
file and search information with generic summaries. Users widely
complained, demanding the return of specific file paths or a simple
toggle, but Anthropic dismissed this feedback, saying the change
simplified things for a majority. 

 3 WAYS TO STOP WASTING YOUR 1:1S WITH YOUR MANAGER (11 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 One-on-one meetings with your manager are a high-leverage opportunity
for career growth, yet they are frequently wasted on mere status
updates. To maximize their value, these meetings should ideally
incorporate three types of conversations: current status, career
development, and strategic future discussions.

 5 TIPS TO INCREASE MOBILE APP DOWNLOADS AND RETENTION IN 2026 (17
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 With vibe-coded apps flooding the stores and ad costs up 60%, there
are other alternatives to increase mobile app downloads. For example,
nail your ASO (it drives 65% of organic installs), write app
descriptions like humans talk (for voice search), make screenshots
sell outcomes not UI, get above 4 stars, and use behavior-triggered
push notifications in the first 3 days before users churn. 

 TECH IMPERSONATORS: CLICKFIX AND MACOS INFOSTEALERS (22 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Datadog identified an active campaign using fake GitHub repositories
to impersonate software companies and distribute infostealers using
the "ClickFix" social engineering technique. Victims are lured to
malicious pages that instruct them to copy-paste commands into their
terminal, leading to the execution of macOS infostealers like MacSync
and SHub Stealer.

 SHOULD YOUR DEVELOPER COMPANY GO OPEN-SOURCE? (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 For founders considering open-source, the decision is a deliberate

statement, that requires careful evaluation of user-contributor
alignment, problem maturity, and monetization boundaries. 

 DO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR REPLYING LATE TO MY EMAIL (7 MINUTE READ) [19]
