 SECURE YOUR BACKEND SERVICES WITHOUT THE AUTH HEADACHES (SPONSOR) [4]


 Your microservices, background workers, and distributed systems need
authentication too, but rolling your own M2M auth is a nightmare.
Clerk's M2M tokens [4] are now production-ready: stable APIs, usage
tracking in the dashboard, and straightforward token-based auth
between any backend service. No more managing service credentials,
rotating secrets, or debugging custom auth flows. Ship secure
service-to-service auth in minutes, not weeks.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO WRITE A GREAT AGENTS.MD: LESSONS FROM OVER 2,500 REPOSITORIES
(6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 GitHub analyzed 2,500+ `agents.md` files and found the successful
ones were specialists with clear jobs, not vague helpers. Good
agents.md files give your agent specific commands to run, concrete
code examples to follow, and explicit boundaries (like “never touch
these files”). Start simple with one focused task like writing tests
or docs, then iterate based on what breaks. 

 ON INHERITING AND SHARING PROPERTY VALUES (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CSS doesn't let you set one property based on another's value (like
`border-radius: height`), and there's no magic `compute()` function
coming. Your best bets right now are to use CSS custom properties if
you know the values, `aspect-ratio` to link width/height,
`currentColor` to reuse colors, or container query units like `100cqh`
to steal parent dimensions. 

 INTRODUCING AWS LAMBDA MANAGED INSTANCES: SERVERLESS SIMPLICITY WITH
EC2 FLEXIBILITY (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AWS Lambda Managed Instances is a new capability that can run AWS
Lambda functions on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud compute while
maintaining serverless operational simplicity. It allows developers to
access specialized compute options and optimize costs for steady-state
workloads using a familiar serverless development experience. Lambda
Managed Instances can be used to define how Lambda functions run on
EC2 instances. Developers can just select compute profiles optimized
for specific workload requirements without taking on the operational
burden of managing Amazon EC2 infrastructure.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY USE REACT? (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While React makes sense as a server-side authoring tool (developers
love JSX and component architecture), shipping it to the browser hurts
users with unnecessary JavaScript. Frameworks like Astro let you write
in React but render plain HTML to users, while Next.js defaults to the
“hydration” pattern that sends all that server-side JavaScript to
the client anyway. 

 MY WEEKLY TECH INDUSTRY INTAKE ROUTINE AS A STAFF ENGINEER (10 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 A Staff Engineer shares his Saturday morning ritual for staying
current: he batches all newsletters into a 2-3 hour block using
Superhuman's split inbox (to separate articles from urgent emails) and
Mailbrew (to group 60+ weekly emails into just 2 digests). His process
is simple: queue interesting articles by title only, read them one by
one, then immediately take action by either saving to Notion for
reference or adding to Todoist as a work idea.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TRACK B2B GROWTH LIKE YOU TRACK USERS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Your organizations are just as important as your users. Now track
them the same way. Clerk's new Organization Growth Analytics [11]
gives you retention, churn, and cohort analysis for every organization
in your app. Daily, weekly, or monthly active orgs. Flexible
filtering. Click any chart segment to drill into specific cohorts.
Stop flying blind on B2B metrics. 

 AWS ANNOUNCES PREVIEW OF AWS INTERCONNECT - MULTICLOUD (1 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 AWS Interconnect - multicloud makes it easy to connect AWS networking
services to other cloud service providers. It will start in preview
with Google Cloud and then open up to Microsoft Azure later in 2026.
The service is now available in preview in five AWS regions. Cloud
service providers can easily adopt the service via a published open
API package on GitHub. 

 RAD (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Rad gives users Python-like scripting with CLI superpowers built in.
It allows users to write maintainable scripts with declarative
argument parsing, built-in JSON processing, and more. The project is
still in early development, but it is already useful for real scripts.
Rad is optimized for CLI scripting - a general-purpose language may be
more appropriate for enterprise applications, high-performance
computations, and projects that require specialized libraries.

 AI AGENTS FIND $4.6M IN BLOCKCHAIN SMART CONTRACT EXPLOITS (22 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Anthropic researchers evaluated AI agents' ability to exploit smart
contracts on a newly created benchmark, SCONE-bench. The agents,
including Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5, successfully exploited
vulnerabilities in smart contracts, collectively amassing $4.6 million
in simulated stolen funds from contracts exploited after March. In a
separate simulation, the AI agents uncovered two novel zero-day
vulnerabilities in recently deployed contracts, showing the technical
feasibility of profitable, real-world autonomous exploitation. 

 THE PERFORMANCE INEQUALITY GAP, 2026 (42 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Despite devices and networks improving, the performance gap between
rich and poor users is still growing. For 2026, the budget is ~150KiB
of HTML/CSS/fonts and ~300-350KiB of JavaScript (gzipped) to serve the
global 75th percentile, but less than half of mobile sites pass Core
Web Vitals because developers keep shipping way more JavaScript than
reasonable.

 After initially rejecting JPEG XL despite community support, Chromium
has reversed its decision and will now support the format. 

 GOOGLE, NVIDIA, AND OPENAI (20 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google's advancements in AI with Gemini 3 and its TPU offerings are
challenging the dominance of OpenAI and Nvidia, forcing them to
re-evaluate their moats and strategies. 

 LAST WEEK ON MY MAC: LOSING CONFIDENCE (30 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This dev has lost confidence in macOS due to silent failures,
uninformative error messages, and the resulting reliance on
workarounds.
