 THROWING MORE AI AT ENGINEERS ISN'T A MAGIC BULLET FOR SOFTWARE
DELIVERY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Atlassian surveyed engineering teams to see who's actually getting
value from AI. Their research [4] found that fragmented tools, context
switching, and information silos are still the biggest productivity
killers for engineering teams — and that AI alone doesn't fix them.

In this live webinar [4], you'll get exclusive findings from Tanya
Chen, Head of Engineering at Atlassian, on how her team actually
implements AI in their workflows. Joined by Product Manager Leader
Partha Kamal, they'll walk through:

 	* How Atlassian is scaling AI across the software development
lifecycle
 	* Real stories from engineering teams
 	* Practical takeaways for leaders driving AI adoption

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SOFTWARE FACTORIES AND THE AGENTIC MOMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 StrongDM has developed a "Software Factory" where AI agents
autonomously write and refine code based on specifications and
scenarios, removing human involvement in coding and review. One of the
main innovations making this possible is its "Digital Twin Universe,"
a system of behavioral clones of third-party services that allows for
high-volume, safe, and cost-effective validation of software
scenarios. 

 HOW WE MADE GEO JOINS 400× FASTER WITH H3 INDEXES (8 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Geo joins use spatial predicates and are computationally expensive
because they lack a clean join key, leading to quadratic complexity.
To overcome this, the Floe database automatically rewrites these
queries to use Uber's H3 indexes. H3 indexes partition geographical
areas into hierarchical hexagonal cells, converting complex spatial
intersections into efficient equi-joins on compact integer keys.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WE MOURN OUR CRAFT (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI is diminishing the programmer's craft, consuming human work, and
reducing their role to mere oversight. Despite this, there is a career
necessity for professionals to embrace these tools to remain
competitive. 

 STOP GENERATING, START THINKING (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A seasoned engineer is uneasy about the industry's rapid adoption of
LLM-generated code. He's worried about outsourcing critical thinking,
as LLMs are best at generation but not as great at reasoning like a
human is. 

 TWO KINDS OF AI USERS ARE EMERGING. THE GAP BETWEEN THEM IS
ASTONISHING (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Martin sees two kinds of AI users emerging: power users who've
embraced tools like Claude Code and are flying, and everyone else
stuck on ChatGPT or Microsoft's enterprise Copilot — which is so bad
that Microsoft itself uses Claude Code internally. The result is small
teams with API access and coding agents massively outproducing
enterprises trapped behind locked-down IT and legacy software.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TRACK USER RETENTION AUTOMATICALLY WITH CLERK (SPONSOR) [10] 

 You're tracking signups but probably not what happens after. Clerk's
new retention report measures how users come back after sign-up:
30-day, 8-week, and 3-month cohorts with industry benchmarks. No
analytics setup required. 

 GITHUB AGENTIC WORKFLOWS (WEBSITE) [11] 

 GitHub Agentic Workflows enable repository automation by running AI
coding agents within GitHub Actions. Users define these continuous AI
workflows in natural language using Markdown files, which are then
compiled into GitHub Actions to automate tasks like code improvements,
issue triage, documentation, and analysis. They integrate deeply with
GitHub, support multiple AI engines like Copilot, Claude, and Codex,
and prioritize safety with sandboxed execution and minimal
permissions. 

 MATCHLOCK (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Matchlock is a CLI tool designed to run AI agents within secure,
ephemeral microVMs, preventing unrestricted access to your machine. It
achieves this by providing network allowlisting, injecting secrets
in-flight (so they never enter the VM), and blocking all other
connections by default. Agents operate in a full, isolated Linux
environment that boots quickly and is disposable, ensuring that even
malicious actions don't compromise your credentials or data.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY E CORES MAKE APPLE SILICON FAST (17 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple silicon Macs achieve their high performance mainly due to their
Efficiency (E) cores, which handle numerous background tasks, rather
than solely relying on Performance (P) cores. Immediately after
startup, E cores are heavily used for processes like Spotlight
indexing and initial backups, leaving the P cores largely free for
user applications. This architecture is managed by macOS's Quality of
Service (QoS) system, which prioritizes foreground tasks for P cores
and restricts background tasks to E cores, even when P cores are idle.


 THE CLOUD AGENT THESIS (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Cloud agents like Devin shift AI coding from local pair programming
to organizational delegation. Running on remote infrastructure, these
tools allow non-engineers to trigger tasks via Slack or Jira. This
model scales capacity asynchronously, moving the primary bottleneck
from code generation to automated review. 

 DEBUGGING WITH AI: CAN IT REPLACE AN EXPERIENCED DEVELOPER? (28
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This dev tested Claude on three real React/Next.js bugs ranging from
easy to hard. It aced the simple one, half-fixed the medium one (but
introduced new issues), and completely failed the tricky one,
confidently going in circles with wrong fixes. AI is a great first
pass for standard bugs, but knowing when to stop prompting and start
thinking is the real skill.

 AGENT SLACK (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Agent Slack is a CLI specifically designed to enable AI agents to
automate various interactions within Slack. 

 (AI) SLOP TERRIFIES ME (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI's ability to produce merely "good enough" software (or "slop")
might create widespread user apathy, ultimately leading to the demise
of quality software craftsmanship. 

 A CASE OF THE REVERSE IVORY TOWER (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Platform engineering creates a reverse ivory tower when rigid
abstractions distance infrastructure from developer reality.
