ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 INTRODUCTION TO POSTGRESQL INDEXES (21 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 PostgreSQL indexes are database objects that speed up data access by
allowing the system to read less from disk, mapping key values to
physical row locations. While these provide speed benefits for
queries, they introduce costs such as increased disk space, overhead
on write operations, longer query planning times, and higher memory
usage. 

 THE BROWSER IS THE SANDBOX (18 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The browser has potential as a secure sandbox for agentic AI tools,
which automate tasks and require access to a user's local files and
network. It has mechanisms for filesystem isolation, controlled
network access via CSP, and secure code execution using iframes and
WebAssembly. A demo project is displayed in this article that shows
these capabilities.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW I ESTIMATE WORK AS A STAFF SOFTWARE ENGINEER (14 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Accurate software project estimation is mostly impossible because
projects are dominated by unpredictable, unknown work. Estimates are
mostly political tools used by non-engineering management to make
funding and strategic decisions, rather than aids for engineering
efficiency. As a result, engineers often reverse the process, starting
with a desired timeframe from management and then defining what scope
of work is achievable within that constraint. 

 AI TRIBALISM (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Discussions around LLMs have devolved into unproductive tribalism,
fueled by early negative associations with tech "hucksters" and fears
of job displacement. AI agents are already capable of efficient code
generation, bug fixing, and addressing complex issues like security
and performance. Engineers need to keep experimenting with AI to stay
on top of new tooling.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 🫱 HANDS-ON WORKSHOP: DEBUGGING NEXT.JS APPS WITH SENTRY (SPONSOR)
[8] 

 Hydration errors, RSC issues, ISR failures — Next.js apps can be
tricky to debug in production. This Sentry workshop [8] covers
debugging performance problems using tracing, logs, and source maps.
It's live and hands-on, with Sentry engineers walking through real
scenarios. Save your spot → [8] 

 CLAWDBOT (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Clawdbot is an open-source, personal AI assistant designed to run on
a user's own devices. Offering local, fast, and always-on AI
capabilities, it integrates with many messaging channels like
WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, and Discord. 

 FENCE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Fence is a lightweight, container-free sandbox tool that wraps
commands to restrict network access and filesystem operations. It's
designed for running semi-trusted code, like package installs or CI
jobs, with controlled side effects, and it improves AI coding agent
security. 

 DPAINT.JS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 DPaint.js is a web-based image editor modeled after the classic
Deluxe Paint, specifically focusing on retro Amiga file formats. It
allows users to read, write, and convert various Amiga formats,
including icon files, IFF ILBM images (up to 256 colors), and even
directly from Amiga Disk Files (ADF).

MISCELLANEOUS

 150,000 LINES OF VIBE CODED ELIXIR: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY
(8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 BoothIQ used AI to write all 150,000 lines of its Elixir codebase,
finding the language's small, terse, and immutable nature great for AI
generation. AI is great at generating code efficiently, especially
when aided by Elixir-specific tools like Tidewave. However, it
struggles with architectural decisions, often produces defensive code
trained on imperative languages, and is ineffective at debugging
complex Elixir concurrency and understanding isolated test
environments. 

 SOME C HABITS I EMPLOY FOR THE MODERN DAY (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Despite not writing C frequently, the author has developed a specific
set of programming habits and styles for C projects due to the
language's lack of standardization. They typically use C23, define
custom fixed-length types like `u8` and `i32`, use a `length+data`
struct for strings, and prefer C23's `bool` type.

QUICK LINKS

 I BUILT A 2X FASTER LEXER, THEN DISCOVERED I/O WAS THE REAL
BOTTLENECK (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 While optimizing a lexer for a 2x speedup, the author discovered the
true bottleneck was I/O syscall overhead from numerous small files. 

 USING POSTGRESQL AS A DEAD LETTER QUEUE FOR EVENT-DRIVEN SYSTEMS (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue for an event-driven system
provided much visibility, queryability, and controlled reprocessing of
failed events compared to Kafka. 

 COI (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Coi is a modern, type-safe, component-based programming language that
uses WASM and fine-grained reactivity to build high-performance web
applications with zero garbage collection and a minimal runtime. 

 WHEN EMPLOYEES FEEL SLIGHTED, THEY WORK LESS (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 New research shows that even minor workplace mistreatment, like
delayed birthday greetings, reduces employee productivity.
