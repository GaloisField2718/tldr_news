 AI, THEN VERIFY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You've embraced AI for a speed boost, but what about quality? The
"engineering productivity paradox" is a real challenge: fast code
generation and growing code volume, but limited by a manual review
process.

SonarQube [5] solves this. Our platform fuels AI-enabled development
[4] so you can: 

 	* Reduce security risks with automated scanning.
 	* Stop tech debt before it's merged.
 	* Boost developer confidence and focus on innovation.

Automate code review with Sonar solutions [5] and build trust into
every line of code.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 I'M BUILDING A BROWSER FOR REVERSE ENGINEERS (19 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article goes over the process of building a custom browser for
web reverse-engineering to streamline the process of analyzing browser
fingerprinting and anti-bot techniques. The project started with a
simple browser extension for hooking JavaScript functions but evolved
to use the Chrome Devtools Protocol for deeper access. Eventually,
Chromium was forked to create custom events for stealthier
instrumentation. The final browser includes features like
deobfuscation, property overrides, and automated decryption of
fingerprinting payloads. 

 HOW WE FOUND A BUG IN GO'S ARM64 COMPILER (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cloudflare discovered a race condition bug in Go's arm64 compiler due
to high traffic volume. The bug caused sporadic panics on arm64
machines related to stack unwinding, which were initially thought to
be rare stack memory corruption. Through deep investigation and
debugging, it was found that async preemption during stack pointer
adjustments in the `(*NetlinkSocket).Receive` function led to an
invalid stack pointer during garbage collection, causing the unwinder
to crash. 

 SVELTE REALLY IS THAT FAST (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A study compared the rendering performance of Angular, React, Vue,
Svelte, and Blazor JavaScript frameworks. It found that Svelte
consistently outperformed the other frameworks in various benchmarks,
especially at creating and updating elements. Svelte's performance is
due to its reactivity system, optimizing compiler, and binding-based
rendering.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SEEING LIKE A SOFTWARE COMPANY (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Large software companies prioritize legibility (measurability and
predictability) over efficiency. While small companies can thrive with
illegible, engineer-driven work, large companies require legibility
for planning, enterprise deals, and coordination, even if it slows
down individual engineers. To balance this, companies create temporary
"zones of illegibility" for urgent problems and rely on informal
backchannels. 

 HOW TO *ACTUALLY* TEST YOUR README (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Devs should test their software's installation instructions on a
fresh virtual machine. When doing so, they should document every step
taken during the installation process, including installing
dependencies, and then transferring that documented history to the
README file to guarantee accuracy and completeness. 

 THE PROGRAMMER IDENTITY CRISIS (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The rise of AI and LLMs threatens the core identity of programmers as
craftspeople. Vibe-coding and specification engineering have turned
programmers into operators rather than creative problem-solvers. This
shift removes a lot of the joy and fulfillment of programming.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ELEVENLABS UI (WEBSITE) [12] 

 ElevenLabs UI is an open-source collection of customizable agent and
audio components. It provides interactive visualizations like agent
orbs that reflect agent states (idle, listening, and talking) and
real-time audio visualizations with smooth scrolling waveforms. The UI
also includes components for voice chat, music playback with controls,
and a conversation interface with text and voice input options. 

 FLEETCODE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 FleetCode is a desktop terminal application for running multiple CLI
coding agents like Claude or Codex in isolated Git worktrees, allowing
for parallel and persistent sessions. It has terminal theming, setup
commands, and MCP server management, all configurable through a
settings panel. 

 UT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 ut is a fast and lightweight CLI utility toolkit for devs. It
provides a variety of tools for encoding, hashing, data generation,
text processing, development, web and network tasks, color
manipulation, and Unicode reference.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MY FIRST CONTRIBUTION TO LINUX (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This dev's first contribution to the Linux kernel was adding support
for the hotkeys on their 2005 Fujitsu Lifebook S2110 laptop. They go
over the process of identifying the relevant driver, studying the code
to understand how it handles key events, and modifying it to recognize
the media keys. They submitted their patch through the traditional
email workflow and saw that it merged into the upstream kernel. 

 WHY WE NEED SIMD (THE REAL REASON) (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions give
performance gains at a relatively low cost by reusing existing CPU
infrastructure. This lets a single instruction perform multiple
operations simultaneously. The adoption of SIMD has been hampered by
the need for software updates to use new instructions. However, recent
advancements are helping increase adoption. 

 THE EMAIL THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE READ (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This dev helped Agency B and C transition to an open-source mail
stack, angering their current provider, who used hidden clauses in
their contract to retaliate. The provider potentially spied on their
emails and threatened legal action, preventing the agencies from
switching and ultimately raising their costs. Despite the ethical
issues, the agencies were unable to break free, showing the challenges
of escaping vendor lock-in.

 NOW OPEN FOR BUILDING: INTRODUCING GEMINI CLI EXTENSIONS (6 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 The Gemini CLI now offers extensions, letting devs personalize their
command-line experience by connecting Gemini to their ideal tools and
workflows through integrations. 

 CSS HAS 42 UNITS (7 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The increasing number of CSS units is a positive evolution driven by
specific needs. 

 RECALL (GITHUB REPO) [20]
