 THE NAME.COM API: MODERN DOMAIN EXPERIENCES THAT SHIP FAST AND
CONVERT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 ✅ Trusted by Vercel, Replit, Netlify, and Bolt

WHAT: A simple, modern API that enables developers to integrate domain
name search, purchase, and management directly into their apps.

WHY: Legacy APIs take months of custom development. The name.com API
[4] is built to OpenAPI spec with AI-enabled docs and MCP
support—ship to production in days.

HOW: Just get your API token and get started. It's free to use with
transparent, volume-based domain pricing.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WHEN AWS WAS DOWN, WE WERE NOT (47 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Authress' auth solution remained operational during a recent AWS
us-east-1 outage that impacted major companies. This was thanks to
avoiding unreliable third-party components, implementing DNS failover
with custom health checks, and using edge compute via CloudFront and
Lambda@Edge. It also used incremental rollouts to reduce the impact
of application failures, a web application firewall (WAF) for handling
malicious requests, and prioritized customer support for issues
outside of automated detection. 

 WHERE TO USE SUB-AGENTS VERSUS AGENTS AS TOOLS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article explains when to use sub-agents versus agents as tools
when building multi-agent AI systems. The main difference is that
agents as tools are self-contained, stateless specialists ideal for
discrete tasks (like converting natural language to SQL), while
sub-agents are delegated team members that share context and handle
complex, multi-step processes requiring ongoing collaboration (like
managing flight bookings with multiple user interactions). Tools
should be used for reusable, atomic functions, while sub-agents are
better for stateful workflows that need access to conversational
history and broader mission context. 

 HOW DASH USES CONTEXT ENGINEERING FOR SMARTER AI (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Dropbox evolved its Dash AI system from a traditional search tool
into an "agentic AI" that can interpret, summarize, and act on
information. Its team discovered that adding more tools and context
often led to worse performance due to analysis paralysis and "context
rot," so they developed three key strategies: limiting tool
definitions by consolidating multiple retrieval options into a single
universal search tool, filtering context to show only the most
relevant information using a knowledge graph, and creating specialized
agents for complex tasks like search query construction.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 OOP: THE WORST THING THAT HAPPENED TO PROGRAMMING (28 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the worst thing that happened to
programming due to its inherent flaws and unnecessary complexity
compared to Functional Programming (FP). Core OOP concepts like
methods, inheritance, and polymorphism lead to the need for complex
design patterns as workarounds. OOP also leads to verbose, bug-prone
code, and developers deeply entrenched in OOP often fail to recognize
its shortcomings. 

 THINGS I DON'T LIKE IN CONFIGURATION LANGUAGES (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This dev is not impressed with existing configuration languages like
YAML, XML, JSON, TOML, and many others. They are overly complex, don't
have some basic features, or are just programming languages disguised
as configuration formats. To address these shortcomings, he created
his own configuration language called MAML based on JSON.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 A PRIMER ON BUILDING SUCCESSFUL AI AGENTS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Moving agents from dev to prod is challenging due to quality,
governance, and security concerns. Discover proven workflows,
frameworks, and observability tools that help you build reliable
agents and deploy them confidently. Get the guide [10]. 

 CONTINUOUS CLAUDE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Continuous Claude is a script that automates the pull request
lifecycle using Claude Code. It commits changes to a new branch,
creates a pull request, waits for checks and reviews, and merges the
PR, repeating until the task is complete. 

 PARQEYE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Parqeye is a terminal-based tool that allows users to inspect Parquet
files. It provides interactive data visualization, schema exploration,
file metadata viewing, and row group statistics examination, all
within a tab-based interface. Users can install Parqeye via direct
download, building from source, or through Cargo. It's released under
the MIT License. 

 PRINCEJS (WEBSITE) [13] 

 PrinceJS is a fast, lightweight, and tree-shakable Bun framework with
features like type safety, middleware, validation, and utilities for
caching, email, uploads, cron jobs, and OpenAPI documentation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SO LONG, AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH: HOW TO ESCAPE THE LINUX
NETWORKING STACK (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Cloudflare uses soft-unicast to share IP addresses across machines,
pushing the limits of the Linux networking stack. It attempted to
create a service called "fish" to proxy IP packets using soft-unicast,
but encountered issues with Linux's socket subsystem and Netfilter
conntrack module. To solve these issues, it explored using Netlink,
TCP_REPAIR, and manipulating routing rules, ultimately terminating TCP
connections instead of forwarding IP packets. 

 ENHANCING HDR ON INSTAGRAM FOR IOS WITH DOLBY VISION (10 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Instagram for iOS is now the first Meta app to support Dolby Vision
video, which improves the HDR viewing experience by preserving amve
and Dolby Vision metadata. Initially, Instagram's video processing,
which uses FFmpeg, discarded this metadata, impacting picture quality.
By collaborating with Dolby and FFmpeg developers, Meta implemented
support for Dolby Vision and amve in its video processing pipeline.

 I CAUGHT GOOGLE GEMINI USING MY DATA—AND THEN COVERING IT UP (1
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The author discovered that Google Gemini accessed and used their
personal data about their past use of the tool Alembic without their
explicit permission, and then attempted to conceal this data access by
lying about it.
