 BRING YOUR C++ LOGIC TO THE EDGE WITH THE FASTLY COMPUTE SDK
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 C++ remains the gold standard for performance-critical applications,
and you can now combine its unparalleled control and speed with the
power of Fastly's [4] global network and WASM runtime. 

The SDK is designed to feel familiar to C++ developers [4] while
providing idiomatic bindings to Fastly's powerful edge primitives like
KV Stores, Config Stores, and external service calls. You can use it
for gaming, IoT, compression, and more.

The Fastly C++ SDK is now in Beta for your most demanding workloads.

 HOW WE PWNED X (TWITTER), VERCEL, CURSOR, DISCORD, AND HUNDREDS OF
COMPANIES THROUGH A SUPPLY-CHAIN ATTACK (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Daniel, a 16-year-old hacker, along with friends, uncovered
supply-chain vulnerabilities in Mintlify, an AI documentation platform
used by many top companies. Daniel specifically found a cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allowed malicious scripts to be
injected into documentation through SVG files, exploiting Mintlify's
internal file fetching. This flaw had a widespread impact, affecting
major customers like Discord, X (Twitter), Vercel, and Cursor, but
Mintlify quickly fixed the issue once the hackers notified it. 

 WHAT IS EC2 INSTANCE ATTESTATION (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 EC2 instance attestation makes it easier to validate that only
trusted software is running on EC2 instances. It is now available in
all AWS Commercial Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.
EC2 Instance Attestation can unlock more use cases for trusted
execution environments, like LLM use, since it allows the utilization
of GPU features. This article provides a demo that shows how a service
provider can build and deploy a service that can be verified from
source code, and how a service consumer can verify those claims by the
provider.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOUR JOB IS TO DELIVER CODE YOU HAVE PROVEN TO WORK (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A software developer's core responsibility is to deliver code that
has been proven to work. The practice of submitting large, untested
pull requests is a dereliction of duty that unfairly burdens
reviewers. Proving code works involves two essential steps: thorough
manual testing to personally verify functionality and demonstrate it,
and bundling automated tests that validate the change. 

 ONE WEIRD TRICK TO MANAGE ENGINEERING CRISES; STAKEHOLDERS LOVE IT (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tactical wins address a specific symptom with a specific fix. These
wins matter because they demonstrate traction. Strategic investments
don't fix individual problems, but instead eliminate entire classes of
problems. The trick is to sequence tactical wins and strategic
investments to reinforce each other. Transparency will help
stakeholders understand the tradeoffs you are making.

 INTRODUCING GPT-5.2-CODEX (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI has launched GPT-5.2-Codex. This new model improves
performance on long-horizon tasks, large code changes, and in Windows
environments. It sets new benchmarks in agentic coding. The model's
capabilities have already led to the discovery of real-world
vulnerabilities. 

 PILOTING CLAUDE IN CHROME (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Claude in Chrome has an integration with Claude Code, where Claude
Code can test code directly in the browser to validate its work.
Claude can also see client-side errors via console logs. 

 PICKNPLACE.JS (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 picknplace.js is a simpler alternative to the usual drag-and-drop
experience, especially on mobile devices. It streamlines the process
into a three-step interaction: pick, scroll, then place. When an item
is picked, an interactive duplicate of the list appears, allowing
users to easily position their selection.

 NVME IS NOT A HARD DISK (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 NVMe (nonvolatile memory express) is a storage access and transport
protocol for flash and next-generation solid-state drives that
delivers high throughput and fast response times for all types of
enterprise workloads. NVME over fabric over TCP allows you to make
storage available even if it is in the wrong box. Distributed storage
may be complicated, but it has a number of very attractive use cases. 

 THE ANATOMY OF LCP – A DEEP DIVE INTO SUB-PARTS (20 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is a Core Web Vitals metric that
measures when the most meaningful piece of content on a page becomes
visible. Optimizing it matters because users should see this primary
content as early as possible. There's more to optimizing than just
reducing image file sizes. This article breaks down LCP into sub-parts
(Time to First Byte, Resource Load Delay, Resource Load Duration, and
Element Render Delay) to explain exactly where time is being spent, so
readers know how to diagnose slow LCP on sites.
