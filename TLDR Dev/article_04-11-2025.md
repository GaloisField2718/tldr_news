 FREE OAUTH, SSO, AND OPENID LEARNING RESOURCES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 For developers building secure and enterprise-ready applications,
knowing your way around authentication and authorization is
non-negotiable. See how simple it is [5] to integrate and configure
your login process.

Start with these TWO USEFUL RESOURCES FROM AUTH0:

1/ Check out OAuth2.0 + OpenID Connect: The Professional Guide [4] for
a deep dive into these commonly-used standards, and how to use them in
different scenarios and application types.

2/ Read Auth0's Single Sign-On Guide [6] for a walk-through on where
to start with SSO, and how to make the right architecture calls.

 HOW PERPLEXITY BUILT AN AI GOOGLE (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Perplexity built an “answer engine” by combining real-time web
search with LLMs through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipeline that searches the web, extracts relevant snippets, and
generates cited answers. Its architecture uses Vespa AI to index 200+
billion URLs, intelligently routes queries between in-house
“Sonar” models and third-party LLMs (GPT/Claude) based on
complexity, and runs on a custom-built ROSE inference engine optimized
for speed and cost. 

 WHY WE MIGRATED FROM PYTHON TO NODE.JS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Skald rewrote its backend from Python (Django) to Node.js a week
after launching to address scaling concerns, primarily due to the
complexities and limitations of Python's asynchronous capabilities for
LLM interactions. Python's async support was unintuitive compared to
Node.js. The migration took three days, and it resulted in a roughly
threefold increase in throughput and a more unified codebase, though
it required building more utilities from scratch and losing the Python
ecosystem's ML focus.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY YOUR RETROSPECTIVES DON'T WORK AND HOW TO FIX THEM (11 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Most retrospectives fail because teams document problems without
fixing them, using vague action items like “investigate” instead
of concrete solutions with owners and deadlines. Toyota's Production
System principles are helpful to follow here. Assign a rotating
“Fixer” role (one person responsible for fixes each week), conduct
postmortems immediately while context is fresh, and implement
permanent solutions that prevent problems from recurring rather than
temporary patches. 

 ARCHITECTURAL DEBT IS NOT JUST TECHNICAL DEBT (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Architectural debt extends beyond code to include business and
strategy layers, impacting whole organizations. Enterprise Architects
should focus on integration patterns, system overlaps, and vendor
lock-in at the application/infrastructure layer, while at the business
layer, they should concentrate on ownership, documentation, and
cross-departmental processes. At the strategy layer, Enterprise
Architects should ensure accurate capability definitions and
frameworks to prevent flawed strategic decisions.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BUILDING DATABASES FOR THE CLOUD-NATIVE AND GENAI ERA (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Enterprises are modernizing with distributed databases to handle
AI-driven workloads. _Distributed SQL Databases for Dummies, 2nd
Edition_ [12] explores how YugabyteDB delivers the scale, resilience,
and consistency needed for next-gen cloud and GenAI applications. 👉

 WEB CODEGEN SCORER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Web Codegen Scorer is a tool developed by the Angular team at
Google to evaluate the quality of web code generated by LLMs. It
allows users to compare code quality across different models,
frameworks, and tools using established code quality measures. 

 ORPC (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 oRPC makes building end-to-end type-safe APIs that adhere to OpenAPI
standards easier. It supports contract-first development and
OpenTelemetry integration, along with various frameworks, schema
validators, and runtimes. The library provides a suite of packages for
building APIs, creating clients, generating OpenAPI specs, and
integrating with popular frameworks such as React and NestJS. 

 RUBY BENCHMARK (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 The Benchmark module in Ruby allows devs to measure the execution
time of Ruby code snippets. It provides detailed reports, including
user CPU time, system CPU time, total time, and real (elapsed) time.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE CASE AGAINST PGVECTOR (13 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 While pgvector is a useful extension for bringing vector similarity
search to Postgres, it's often oversimplified in online tutorials.
There are still many challenges with running pgvector in production,
including complex index management, query planning difficulties with
filtering, and the hidden costs of real-time indexing. Existing blog
posts often omit the operational realities and trade-offs involved,
and for many teams, traditional vector databases are usually simpler. 

 WHY ENGINEERS CAN'T BE RATIONAL ABOUT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES (12
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Programming language choices are often driven by identity and emotion
rather than objective technical analysis, leading to costly mistakes.
Neuroscience research supports this, showing that challenging
identity-based beliefs activates threat responses in the brain. This
article shows this with examples, including a personal experience
where a CTO's Perl preference bankrupted a company and a more recent
example where a VP chose Rust based on hype. 

 AI'S DIAL-UP ERA (17 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The current AI boom is similar to the internet's early days in 1995.
There should be caution against extreme optimism and pessimism
surrounding AI's impact. AI's effect on employment will vary by
industry, depending on unmet demand and the pace of automation.

[19] 

 Faced with a massive, 9,000-line "vibe-coded" pull request, a Hacker
News commenter asks for advice to deal with it, to which the community
tells him to reject it outright or sarcastically use AI for review.

 This is a detailed explanation of how Linux manages process memory
that covers topics such as virtual memory, page tables, VMAs, memory
mapping, copy-on-write, transparent huge pages, TLB invalidation,
Meltdown mitigations, and tools for inspecting memory usage.

library with easier integration, safer APIs, faster performance, and
full API coverage.
