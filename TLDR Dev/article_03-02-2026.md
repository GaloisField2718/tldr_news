 WHY IS THERE ALWAYS A MEETING BOT IN YOUR ZOOM CALL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Blame Recall.ai [4].

They secretly power every meeting bot and desktop recording app, from
Cluely to Hubspot to Clickup.

Recall.ai [4] handles the hard part: getting clean recordings,
transcripts, and metadata across Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams,
in-person meetings, and more - so developers don't have to.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 UNROLLING THE CODEX AGENT LOOP (20 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI's Codex CLI is a cross-platform local software agent. The core
agent loop orchestrates interactions between the user, the model, and
various tools, iteratively building prompts from user input, system
instructions, and tool definitions, querying the model, executing
requested tool calls, and appending results to the prompt. To manage
performance and context window limitations, Codex uses prompt caching
and conversation compaction to summarize past interactions. 

 CLAUDE CODE'S RENDERER IS MORE COMPLEX THAN A GAME ENGINE (12 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Through profiling, Claude Code was found to spend 70% of its time on
`futex` calls and make 89,000 `sched_yield` calls, showing inefficient
thread spinning rather than proper I/O waiting. Quantitatively, Claude
Code executes billions of instructions per "frame" for text rendering
and network I/O, an order of magnitude more than SM64 uses for its 3D
world. 

 THE TOO EARLY BREAKPOINT (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There's a common issue in responsive web design where layouts switch
to mobile versions prematurely, leading to awkward designs. To address
this, it's best to implement more breakpoints, use container queries,
and use modern CSS features like Grid and Flex.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BEING “JUST A DEVELOPER” ISN'T ENOUGH ANYMORE (7 MINUTE READ) [9]


 For a decade, being "just a developer" focused only on writing code
was a lucrative and stable career. However, the rise of AI is making
pure technical execution less valuable and more accessible. To remain
valuable, developers must evolve by acquiring deep business domain
knowledge and broadening their skills beyond coding to include areas
like product, operations, and marketing. 

 WHAT I LEARNED BUILDING AN OPINIONATED AND MINIMAL CODING AGENT (40
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This dev got frustrated with Claude Code constantly changing and
adding features he didn't need, so he built his own minimal coding
agent called “pi” with just 4 tools (read, write, edit, and bash)
and a tiny system prompt under 1,000 tokens. He deliberately skipped
everything that other agents have (no MCP servers, no permission
prompts, and no plan modes). Despite being so simple, it scored
competitively on Terminal-Bench, proving that less can actually be
more at times.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AI AGENTS GET CURRENT CLERK PATTERNS NOW (SPONSOR) [11] 

 AI coding tools like Cursor and Copilot generate outdated patterns.
Clerk Skills gives agents current authentication knowledge via
installable packages. One command: _npx skills add clerk/skills_.
Handles custom flows, B2B auth setup, database syncing, and more.
Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Copilot.

Install Clerk Skills [12]

 INTRODUCING THE CODEX APP (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI has launched the Codex app for macOS for managing multiple AI
agents, running work in parallel, and collaborating on long-running
tasks. It also includes AI agent skill management and the ability to
create automations for scheduled background work. 

 SHORLABS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Shorlabs makes the deployment, management, and scaling of Python or
Node.js backend apps easier. It uses AWS Lambda to offer a
pay-per-use, automatically scalable solution, and also has one-click
GitHub deployments, automatic runtime detection, custom subdomains,
configurable compute resources, and real-time logs. 

 MOLTWORKER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Moltworker is an experimental project that enables OpenClaw, a
personal AI assistant, to run within a Cloudflare Sandbox on
Cloudflare Workers. This AI assistant has a web-based control UI,
supports multiple chat platforms like Telegram and Discord, and has
persistent conversations with extensible AI agent capabilities.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW WE USE AI TO TURN FIGMA DESIGNS INTO PRODUCTION CODE (8 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Monday discovered that asking AI to directly generate code from Figma
produced messy output with hard-coded values that didn't follow their
design system. Instead, its team built an MCP that made their design
system machine-readable and a LangGraph agent that analyzes the design
through 11 steps (figuring out which components to use, resolving
design tokens, and planning accessibility), then returns a structured
context that the coding model uses to generate production-ready code. 

 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT AND MCP (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 MCP's primary value is "steering" the LLM agent by exposing
well-described, always-on tools that generate LLM-catered responses
and hints. While CLIs can offer some steering, they don't have this
persistent context, and common workarounds like "Skills" or
progressive disclosure are not as reliable due to context rot. Using
subagents may be the solution. 

 HACKING MOLTBOOK: AI SOCIAL NETWORK REVEALS 1.5M API KEYS (13 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Wiz researchers found security flaws in Moltbook, a new AI social
network, due to a misconfigured Supabase database. This vulnerability
granted full read and write access, exposing 1.5 million API
authentication tokens, 35,000 user emails, private messages, and even
third-party credentials. The vibe-coded platform, initially claiming
1.5 million AI agents, was largely made of only 17,000 human owners
controlling fleets of bots.
