ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CLOCK SYNCHRONIZATION IS A NIGHTMARE (18 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Clock synchronization is a persistent challenge in distributed
systems, coming from the inherent inaccuracies of physical computer
clocks and the absence of a single global time source. There are
various methods used, from simpler algorithms like NTP for millisecond
accuracy to advanced hardware-assisted PTP for nanosecond precision.
For systems demanding strong consistency, like Google Spanner's
TrueTime, hybrid approaches combine physical time with bounded
uncertainty. 

 THE PRODUCTION BUG THAT MADE ME CARE ABOUT UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR (14
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A production bug in a C++ payment processing system returned an
impossible "error: true, succeeded: true" response, which the author
traced to uninitialized boolean fields in a `Response` struct. This
seemingly straightforward issue was a consequence of C++'s
counter-intuitive default initialization rules for non-POD types,
where the compiler-generated default constructor left primitive fields
uninitialized. The fix involved either explicitly value-initializing
the struct at the call site or providing default member initializers
within the struct definition.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 BUILD SOFTWARE. BUILD USERS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 True software quality is often missed because engineers fail to
deeply understand user needs. A possible solution is to "vibe code
users" first, before coding the software itself, by creating detailed,
LLM-driven user agents that simulate target users and their
interactions. This iterative process involves building these agentic
users with defined profiles and "happy paths," then developing
software, and finally allowing the simulated users to provide
feedback, refining both the agents and the software. 

 AI IS FORCING US TO WRITE GOOD CODE (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI agents require a higher standard of code quality. Previously
"optional" best practices are now essential requirements for effective
operation. Thoughtful file organization and extensive use of
end-to-end type systems are also necessary for guiding agents,
reducing errors, and improving context loading. 

 YOU CAN'T DESIGN SOFTWARE YOU DON'T WORK ON (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Effective design for large, existing software systems requires an
intimate, concrete understanding of the codebase, not generic advice.
Generic software design, often found in books or blogs, is typically
useless for day-to-day problems because concrete factors and existing
code details always dominate practical discussions. This generic
advice is instead valuable for new projects, tie-breaking existing
system decisions, or shaping broad company-wide architectural
strategies.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 EXOPRIORS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ExoPriors is a powerful search engine for intelligence
explosion-related research, with arbitrary SQL and vector algebra
search capabilities over a growing index of documents from sources
like arXiv and LessWrong. It allows users to ask nuanced questions by
using techniques like vector mixing, debiasing, and temporal deltas.
The platform integrates with AI models like Claude Code and Claude
Web. 

 ENSUE MEMORY NETWORK (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Ensue Memory Network is a tool designed to provide LLMs with a
persistent, growing knowledge tree, preventing them from "resetting"
and losing context with each new conversation. It aims to solve the
problem of LLMs starting from zero by allowing knowledge, research,
and decisions to compound and carry forward across interactions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 2025: THE YEAR IN LLMS (41 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 2025 was when LLMs learned to reason, allowing models to tackle
complex, multi-step tasks, which in turn drove the widespread adoption
of highly capable AI agents. "Coding agents” came to life,
autonomously writing, executing, and debugging code across
command-line interfaces and even mobile phones. The competitive
landscape shifted a lot as Chinese open-weight models dominated
capability rankings, and Google's Gemini made large strides with new
models and features like Nano Banana, challenging OpenAI's previous
industry lead. 

 THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI coding is creating an industrial revolution in software,
transforming its production from a craft into an increasingly
automated manufacturing process. This shift reduces costs and
dramatically increases output, creating a new class of low-value,
easily reproducible "disposable software" or "AI slop." While
traditional human-written software might become a niche, innovation is
still necessary for generating value and driving technological
progress alongside industrialization. 

 MY ROLE AS A FOUNDER CTO: YEAR EIGHT (16 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 During 2025, RevenueCat received an acquisition offer that would have
nine-figure sums for the founders, leading to intense internal debate
and emotional weeks. Ultimately, both co-founders decided against
selling, opting to remain independent and raise a new round to
continue building what they hope will be a generational company.

QUICK LINKS

 THE FUTURE OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IS SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS (8 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Current AI hype, like previous technological shifts, will not
eliminate software developers because the main challenge of
programming is in translating ambiguous human thought into precise
computational logic. 

 GO AWAY, PYTHON! (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article shows how to make Go programs executable like shell
scripts by exploiting a shell's ENOEXEC fallback to run the Go
compiler via a specially crafted first line, making Go scriptable like
Python. 

 WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEY HATE YOUR PRODUCT WITH A BURNING PASSION (8
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 To effectively address negative public feedback, prioritize the
acknowledgment of customer frustration and take accountability over
giving defensive rebuttals. 

 I HOPE GENERATIVE AI DOES AWAY WITH SEO (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The author hopes that generative AI will eliminate SEO, which has
degraded web search results by incentivizing content optimized for
algorithms and monetization.
