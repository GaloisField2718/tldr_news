ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 VIBING A NON-TRIVIAL GHOSTTY FEATURE (16 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This is a “day-in-the-life” of creating a new macOS automatic
update feature for Ghostty, a terminal application, through AI coding
tools. The process involved iterative AI sessions for UI prototyping,
backend implementation, and code cleanup, interspersed with a lot of
manual coding and problem-solving. AI was the most useful for UI
iteration and as a background code processor. The total token cost was
$15.98 with an estimated 8 hours of wall clock time. 

 HTML'S BEST KEPT SECRET: THE OUTPUT TAG (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The often overlooked HTML `output` tag provides built-in assistive
technology support for dynamic results. Unlike `div` elements with
ARIA attributes, `output` automatically announces its value changes to
screen readers. It can be used with or without a `form`, linking to
input elements via the `for` attribute, and has great browser support.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 EXAMPLES ARE THE BEST DOCUMENTATION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Examples are often more useful than formal documentation, which is
frequently too dense and assumes deeper ecosystem knowledge. The
Python `max` function documentation is an example, where a few simple
code snippets can quickly show its usage, especially for common tasks.


 AFTER THE AI BOOM: WHAT MIGHT WE BE LEFT WITH? (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The current AI boom differs from the dotcom era due to its focus on
proprietary, short-lived systems rather than open infrastructure.
Investment is primarily directed towards specialized GPUs and AI data
centers optimized for specific vendors, creating closed ecosystems.
However, a potential overbuild could lead to cheaper access to
powerful compute for everyone.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REACT COMPILER V1.0 (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 React Compiler v1.0 has been released. It's a build-time tool that
automatically optimizes React and React Native components through
memoization without code rewrites. 

 BUN 1.3 (68 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Bun 1.3 is a huge update that turns Bun into a full-stack JavaScript
runtime. Bun now includes a full-stack dev server with hot reloading,
built-in clients for MySQL, Redis, and improved HTTP ergonomics. The
update also introduces new testing and debugging tools like VS Code
integration, concurrent tests, and type testing, as well as better
security features such as Bun.secrets for encrypted credential storage
and CSRF protection. 

 RIFT (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Rift is a tiling window manager for macOS with multiple layout
styles, a menu bar icon, mission control, and hot-reloadable
configuration. It allows users to tile windows in i3/sway-like or
BSPWM-like arrangements, provides performant animations, and supports
trackpad gestures for workspace switching.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY IT TOOK 4 YEARS TO GET A LOCK FILES SPECIFICATION (7 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 After four years of dedicated effort, a standard lock file format
specification for Python has finally been established. The process
involved navigating complex dependency management issues, including
handling various installation methods, user-defined dependencies, and
platform-specific requirements, while still aiming for a format that
is both machine-readable and human-friendly. 

 AFTER NINE YEARS OF GRINDING, REPLIT FINALLY FOUND ITS MARKET. CAN IT
KEEP IT? (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 After nine years of slow growth and multiple failed business models,
Replit, a coding platform, has finally found success by targeting
non-technical users with its AI-powered coding agent. The company's
revenue has skyrocketed, leading to a $250 million funding round and a
$3 billion valuation.
