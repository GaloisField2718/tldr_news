 FRAMEWORK + SCORECARD: AI PROTOTYPING FOR PRODUCT LEADERS (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 According to Forrester, 88% of engineering, product, and design
leaders think prototyping needs to happen earlier. Wait til late in
the lifecycle to surface changes and you'll get months of delays.

🤔 But to find issues when you still have time to fix them, you need
tools that create editable prototypes, not fully fleshed bad ideas. 

In this Miro guide [4], product leaders get a:

1️⃣ Question set to define requirements & priorities

2️⃣ AI prototyping landscape overview

3️⃣ Tooling evaluation framework + scorecard [4] 

Tackle problems early in the lifecycle by accelerating your
prototyping strategy. Get the guide to learn how.  [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 CLAUDE AGENT SKILLS: A FIRST PRINCIPLES DEEP DIVE (8 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Claude's Agent Skills system is a prompt-based architecture that
extends LLM capabilities through specialized instruction injection
rather than traditional function calling or code execution. Skills are
prompt templates that modify conversation context and execution
permissions. Claude makes skill selection decisions through pure
language understanding rather than algorithmic routing. 

 MAKING COMPLEX WEB APPS FASTER (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft is proposing a new Delayed Message Timing API to help web
developers diagnose and fix performance issues in complex web
applications that use multiple windows, iframes, or worker threads.
The API addresses three main causes of messaging delays: busy
receiving contexts, congested task queues, and
serialization/deserialization overhead by providing detailed timing
metrics and diagnostic information.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ASK HN: HOW CAN I GET BETTER AT USING AI FOR PROGRAMMING? (HACKER
NEWS THREAD) [7] 

 A dev is struggling to effectively use AI, specifically Claude Code,
to rewrite an old jQuery and Django project into SvelteKit.
Experienced users recommend using a CLAUDE.md file correctly for
persistent instructions, using Claude's "plan mode" for task breakdown
before implementation, and adding feedback loops through tests to
verify the AI's work. Also, Opus 4.5 should be used over any other
model for coding when possible. 

 JUSTIFIED (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 just can normalize most projects in a convenient, fast, readable, and
portable way. Large language models are good at generating justfiles,
and justfiles help models know what actions they can run on a project.
This post goes through some tricks you can do with just. 

 JSDOC *IS* TYPESCRIPT (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Svelte's move to JSDoc for type declarations was not a rejection of
TypeScript. Rather, JSDoc should be understood as an inherent part of
TypeScript itself. This is because the TypeScript language service
powers the static analysis and IntelliSense for both `.ts` files and
JSDoc comments, making them two sides of the same coin.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GETTING PRACTICAL ABOUT SERVICE MANAGEMENT TRANSFORMATION (SPONSOR)
[10] 

 Legacy ITSM tools love rigid processes. Atlassian puts teams first -
no matter what their processes look like. This free guide [10] covers
how to run change, incident, and request management in a way that
actually works for modern Dev and Ops workflows. Get the whitepaper
[10] 

 SHADCN/CREATE (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 shadcn/create lets developers build their own shadcn/ui. Everything
is customizable - developers can change components, icons, colors,
themes, and fonts to build something unique. shadcn/create is
available for Next.js, Vite, TanStack Start, and v0. A video
introducing the framework is available in the thread. 

 CAPSUDO (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 capsudo is an object-capability style sudo. It creates a socket that
acts as an object capability, allowing anyone who can access the
socket to make use of it. The capsudo daemon accepts connections,
stitching everything together to run programs bound to object
capabilities. Examples of how to use the tool are available in the
repository. 

 THE UNOFFICIAL 37SIGNALS/DHH RAILS STYLE GUIDE (47 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This GitHub gist contains a Claude Code-generated style guide based
on a deep analysis of 37signal's open source project management tool,
Fizzy. Claude Code was used to analyze the entire code base to extract
the patterns used and infer the philosophy of implementation choices.
The guide contains patterns extracted from actual code, guidance based
on observed conventions, notes on what's deliberately absent, and
reusable code that can be copied into personal projects.

 CODING AGENTS & COMPLEXITY BUDGETS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Cursor migrated from a headless CMS to raw code and Markdown after
realizing the CMS created unnecessary abstraction and slowed down
content updates. They used Cursor's AI coding agents and completed the
migration in just three days, spending only $260 in tokens to automate
content export, conversion, and codebase refactoring. 

 YOU SHOULD NEVER BUILD A CMS (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Cursor migration from Sanity to a markdown and Git-based system
mentioned above was responded to by Sanity. Sanity acknowledged valid
frustrations with clunky preview workflows, authentication
fragmentation, and AI agent accessibility. However, they still found
that Cursor's new system still has trouble at scale due to issues like
content denormalization, poor collaboration, and limited querying
capabilities for AI. 

 HOW GOOD ENGINEERS WRITE BAD CODE AT BIG COMPANIES (8 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Big tech companies produce surprisingly sloppy code because most code
changes are made by engineers who are relative beginners to the
specific codebase, programming language, or system they're working on.
This happens due to high employee turnover, frequent internal
reorganizations, and compensation structures that incentivize
job-hopping.

QUICK LINKS

 WHAT IS A BUILD SYSTEM, ANYWAY? (22 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A build system is pretty much anything that lets you specify
dependencies on a previous artifact. 

 HOW TO LOAD CSS (FAST) (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Compression dictionaries have the potential to revolutionize the way
CSS is served to users, as they significantly reduce costs. 

 ENGINEERING INTELLIGENCE (9 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Intelligence is engineered, not trained: models are components,
systems create value, and engineering makes machine learning real. 

 SURGERY ON CHROMIUM SOURCE CODE: REPLACING DEVTOOLS' HTTP HANDLER
WITH REDIS PUB/SUB (10 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 For reliable and scalable automation of numerous Chromium browser
sessions, this dev directly integrated Redis Pub/Sub messaging into
Chromium's DevTools pipe handler to remove the instability and
complexity of traditional TCP/IP communication. 

 I FED 24 YEARS OF MY BLOG POSTS TO A MARKOV MODEL (10 MINUTE READ)
[21] 

 This dev showed off his simple Markov text generator, Mark V. Shaney
Junior, showing the "gibberish" it produces after being trained on
various texts. 

 USE PYTHON FOR SCRIPTING! (8 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Python is great for scripting due to its widespread availability,
standardized library, and clearer syntax. 

 HOME DEPOT EXPOSED ACCESS TO INTERNAL SYSTEMS FOR A YEAR, SAYS
RESEARCHER (6 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Home Depot's internal systems were exposed for a year due to an
employee's mistakenly published access token, which a security
researcher discovered and reported, but the company ignored the alerts
until TechCrunch intervened to prompt a fix.
