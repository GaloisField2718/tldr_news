ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHY FROZEN TEST FIXTURES ARE A PROBLEM ON LARGE PROJECTS AND HOW TO
AVOID THEM (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Test fixtures often become "frozen" in large software projects
because modifications risk breaking thousands of unrelated tests that
make implicit assumptions about the data. The recommended solution is
to write highly focused tests that assert only the specific property
they intend to verify, rather than comparing entire data structures. 

 BACKGROUND CODING AGENTS: PREDICTABLE RESULTS THROUGH STRONG FEEDBACK
LOOPS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Spotify's background coding agents use verification loops to stay on
track. Independent verifiers, like Maven, build systems and tests that
run automatically and give incremental feedback. An LLM judge also
vetoes PRs when agents get too creative and drift from their prompts.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 OWN A GRAPH (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 If you're working in tech, you should "own a graph" as a critical
unit of responsibility. This practice helps focus on and track
progress for important, multi-quarter problems, making sure your work
is directed towards meaningful outcomes. Graphs are the most powerful
tool for concisely communicating impact. 

 IF YOU'RE GOING TO VIBE CODE, WHY NOT DO IT IN C? (9 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Vibe coding is effective. However, traditional programming languages
are primarily designed for human readability and convenience, not
machine needs. As a result, it's worth exploring "vibe-oriented
programming languages" that would prioritize machine ergonomics and
potentially generate low-level code instead. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BEFORE YOU PICK AN AI PROTOTYPING TOOL, ANSWER ONE QUESTION (SPONSOR)
[10] 

 Most teams ask "Which tool is best?" The better question: "Which
approach gets us from idea to collaboration fastest?" Miro's AI
prototyping landscape guide [10] provides a requirement question set,
decision framework, and evaluation scorecard so you can pick the tools
that actually match your needs. Get the guide [10] 

 INTRODUCING: DEVSTRAL 2 AND MISTRAL VIBE CLI (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Mistral AI has launched Devstral 2 and Devstral Small 2, its
next-generation open-source agentic coding models, along with the
Mistral Vibe CLI for end-to-end code automation. Devstral 2 (123B) is
a state-of-the-art model establishing new benchmarks for open-weight
code agents. The Mistral Vibe CLI provides an open-source command-line
interface that uses Devstral models to autonomously explore, modify,
and execute changes across entire codebases. 

 DURABLE STREAMS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Durable Streams is an open protocol that provides real-time sync to
client applications. It supports catch-up reads and live tailing. The
protocol works anywhere HTTP works, and it is built on standard HTTP
with no custom protocols. Durable Streams is built for production
scale. It complements backend streaming systems by reliably streaming
data to client applications. 

 STREAMDOWN (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Streamdown is a drop-in replacement for `react-markdown` specifically
engineered to handle the unique challenges of streaming Markdown
content from AI models. It fixes issues like incomplete or
unterminated Markdown blocks. Streamdown supports GitHub Flavored
Markdown, LaTeX math rendering, Mermaid diagrams, and Shiki code
highlighting. 

 FATE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Fate is a modern data client for React and tRPC that simplifies data
fetching and state management. It combines features like view
composition, normalized caching, data masking, and Async React
capabilities with tRPC's type safety.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MAKING MACOS BEARABLE (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Stock macOS can be inefficient and disruptive. To regain a
frictionless workflow, this dev re-engineered macOS to reduce visual
searching and manual interaction. This was done by using Aerospace for
deterministic window management, Tmux for streamlined development,
modal editing for text manipulation, and tools like Vimium and Homerow
for keyboard-driven navigation across the browser and OS. 

 WRITING OUR OWN CHEAT ENGINE: INTRODUCTION (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This post introduces the goal of writing a small Cheat Engine clone
in Rust to understand how the original tool functions by replicating
its tutorial steps. The first step focuses on learning to enumerate
active processes, opening them, and retrieving their module names
programmatically. This is done through Windows API functions like
`EnumProcesses`, `OpenProcess`, `EnumProcessModules`, and
`GetModuleBaseNameA` while managing Rust's `unsafe` code.

QUICK LINKS

 2 YEARS WITH SHAPE-UP, AND WHY WE SWITCHED BACK (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 After two years, this dev's company switched from the Shape-Up
software development methodology because its rigid 6-week cycles and
project size mismatch no longer suited their needs for flexibility and
a clearer product direction. 

 DJANGO: WHAT'S NEW IN 6.0 (26 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Django 6.0 introduces a host of new features, including template
partials, a built-in tasks framework, Content Security Policy (CSP)
support, and a modernized email API. 

 THE NEXT ERA OF REACT HAS ARRIVED: HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW (10
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 React's new “Async React” combines five primitives to handle
coordination automatically: `useTransition` tracks async work,
‘useOptimistic` makes UI instant (checkboxes toggle before server
responds), Suspense handles loading, use() replaces `useEffect` for
data fetching, and `useDeferredValue` keeps inputs responsive. 

 DOWNDETECTOR AND THE REAL COST OF NO UPSTREAM DEPENDENCIES (5 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 Downdetector is a service built to monitor outages, but it
experienced downtime itself during a Cloudflare outage. 

 SO YOU WANT TO SPEAK AT SOFTWARE CONFERENCES? (9 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 The journey to becoming a software conference speaker begins by
developing and refining unique talks at local user groups to practice,
then progressing to community conferences to be seen and build a
professional network.
