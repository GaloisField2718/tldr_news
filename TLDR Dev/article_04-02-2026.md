ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DEEP DIVE: HOW CLAUDE CODE'S /INSIGHTS COMMAND WORKS (14 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 The `/insights` command in Claude Code generates an HTML report that
analyzes users' interaction patterns across all their sessions. This
process involves filtering session logs, extracting metadata, and
using an LLM to perform qualitative "facet extraction" on session
transcripts. The aggregated data and LLM insights then identify
interaction styles, successful workflows, and friction points, and
proposes actionable suggestions. 

 SUBAGENTS: WHEN AND HOW TO USE THEM (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Subagents are specialist agents that your main AI agent can spawn to
handle focused tasks in their own clean context, keeping your main
conversation readable instead of cluttered with noise. The two useful
patterns are chaining them sequentially (like scout files →
implement → verify) or running them in parallel for exploration.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 7 SLACK HACKS FOR ENGINEERS AND MANAGERS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 To improve productivity when using Slack or Teams, organize channels
into priority-based categories (read now/daily/weekly), mute
lower-priority groups until scheduled check-ins, and use message
reminders instead of leaving things unread. 

 I LEFT FAANG FOR A STARTUP AND REGRETTED IT (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A dev left Amazon for a $300K startup in SF and got let go after 3
weeks when he admitted he didn't actually like the work. Startups need
obsession and not just talent, and he wasn't willing to sacrifice
everything for someone else's vision. 

 WHAT, THEN, ARE WE PAYING FOR? (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Despite AI making it easier to build custom solutions, the true value
of buying software lies in paying another entity to own and
continually maintain a specific problem domain, freeing the buyer from
that ongoing responsibility.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 XCODE 26.3 UNLOCKS THE POWER OF AGENTIC CODING (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Xcode 26.3 introduces agentic coding, allowing developers to
integrate AI agents directly into their app development workflow. This
new capability enables agents like Anthropic's Claude Agent and
OpenAI's Codex to autonomously tackle complex tasks, interact with
project architecture, and visually verify their work. 

 INTRODUCING DENO SANDBOX (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Deno Sandbox is a new platform designed to securely run untrusted
code, especially LLM-generated code, that frequently calls external
APIs with sensitive credentials. It provides lightweight Linux
microVMs with defense-in-depth security with features like granular
network egress control and a unique mechanism that protects secrets
from exfiltration by only materializing them during approved outbound
requests. 

 INTRODUCING THE NEW V0 (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vercel's v0 now allows users to work directly on existing codebases,
integrates Git workflows for entire teams, has secure database
connections, and guarantees enterprise-grade security by default.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LESSONS LEARNED SHIPPING 500 UNITS OF MY FIRST HARDWARE PRODUCT (12
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A former software engineer ventured into hardware by launching
"Brighter," a powerful lamp, after a successful crowdfunding campaign.
He immediately faced numerous challenges, including prototype
brightness issues, unexpected tariff hikes, manufacturing errors with
parts like heatsinks and knobs, and quality control problems with
wiring and accessories. Despite these hurdles, the team iteratively
fixed problems, produced the 500 units, and delivered them to
customers. 

 RESURRECTING CRIMSONLAND (23 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Banteg embarked on a project to resurrect the cult classic 2003 game
Crimsonland by reverse engineering its binary to achieve a
pixel-perfect, behaviorally identical rewrite. This process involved
static and runtime analysis using tools like Ghidra, Binary Ninja,
Windbg, and Frida to understand the game's undocumented architecture
and logic. A large part of the project was using AI, particularly
GPT-5.2 and Codex, to automate tasks like function renaming and
deciphering custom file formats.

QUICK LINKS

 NOTEPAD++ SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK BREAKDOWN (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 From June to October 2025, the Notepad++ update infrastructure was
compromised in a supply chain attack, allowing threat actors to deploy
malware. 

 1 KILOBYTE IS PRECISELY 1000 BYTES (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While a kilobyte is commonly understood as 1,024 bytes in computing
due to binary systems, its precise and standardized definition is
1,000 bytes. 

 ENGINE FAILURE (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google's Project Genie is an AI world-builder that triggered stock
declines for Unity and Roblox. 

 UNLESS THAT CLAW IS THE FAMOUS OPENCLAW (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 OpenClaw, an autonomous AI agent with full shell access and browser
control, has security risks, including prompt injection and session
theft, so developers must use dedicated hardware and burner accounts
to keep their main accounts safe.
