 😘 KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. But getting that kind of coverage—and staying there—is
hard and pricey for any size team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native service SUPPORTS WEB AND MOBILE APPS,
delivering 80% automated test coverage in weeks [6] and helping teams
SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles to minutes.

With QA Wolf, you get:

✅ Unlimited parallel test runs

✅ 15-min QA cycles

✅ 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation

✅ Zero-flake guarantee

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] saw 4x more test cases
and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 PORTING 100K LINES FROM TYPESCRIPT TO RUST USING CLAUDE CODE IN A
MONTH (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This dev ported the ~100k line "Pokemon Showdown" codebase from
JavaScript to Rust in about a month using Claude Code. The project
required overcoming technical and operational challenges, including
bypassing Claude's sandbox, automating continuous input, and managing
large context windows. It also needed "babysitting" and iterative
refinement. The resulting Rust codebase was completed through 5,000
commits. 

 HOW WRONG CAN A JAVASCRIPT DATE CALCULATION GO? (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A JavaScript dev tried adding one month to January 1, 2024, and
somehow got March 4, 2023. The culprit was timezone handling, as
midnight UTC was still December 31 in Pacific Time, so adding a month
landed on the non-existent “February 31”, which overflowed into
March. 

 HEXAGONAL GRIDS (45 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article goes over the geometry of hexagonal grids, including
"pointy" and "flat" orientations, and various coordinate systems used
in online maps and games. It highlights offset, cube, axial, and
doubled systems, recommending axial/cube for their algorithmic
elegance and simplicity. The article provides formulas and algorithms
for common operations such as finding neighbors, calculating
distances, drawing lines, determining movement ranges, rotation,
reflection, and generating rings or spirals.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THERE IS AN AI CODE REVIEW BUBBLE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The AI code review market is experiencing rapid growth, so companies
like Greptile are starting to differentiate their products beyond
standard performance metrics. Greptile distinguishes itself by its
long-term vision for AI code review, built on the pillars of
independence, autonomy, and feedback loops. This approach emphasizes
separate agents for code generation and validation, pushing for full
automation of review, testing, and QA with minimal human intervention.


 SOMETIMES YOUR JOB IS TO STAY THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY (6 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 “Wolves” are rare, highly productive engineers who autonomously
tackle critical problems, driven solely by the work's importance
rather than recognition. Attempts to formalize "Wolf" roles fail, as
these individuals thrive only in a safe, healthy, and distraction-free
engineering culture. For managers, the most effective approach is
often to recognize genuine "Wolf" contributions and then "stay the
hell out of the way." 

 RIP LOW-CODE 2014-2025 (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The rise of AI is an existential threat to low-code platforms as it
alters their return on investment. Historically, low-code tools
enabled non-technical users to build software with fewer developer
resources, but AI coding now makes it faster, cheaper, and easier for
developers to ship similar tools in-house.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BLOCK CREDENTIAL STUFFING WITH ONE TOGGLE (SPONSOR) [15] 

 Clerk's Client Trust automatically requires a second factor when
users sign in from new devices with valid credentials. Attackers can't
complete the flow. Legitimate users won't notice. Free & one toggle to
enable.

 VIBEFIGMA (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 VibeFigma is a tool that automatically transforms Figma designs into
production-ready React components using Tailwind CSS. It uses the
official Figma API for accurate design extraction, generates
React/TypeScript components, and has optional AI-powered code
optimization. 

 BONSPLIT (WEBSITE) [18] 

 Bonsplit is a macOS library that provides a custom tab bar and layout
split system with smooth 120fps animations, drag-and-drop reordering,
and SwiftUI support. It allows devs to create, update, and close tabs,
and split panes horizontally or vertically, offering full programmatic
control over the layout.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE ADOLESCENCE OF TECHNOLOGY (100 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, argues that humanity is entering a
"technological adolescence" where AI could soon surpass Nobel
Prize-level intelligence, creating existential risks ranging from
autonomous "rogue" behavior to the democratic collapse of labor
markets. The urgent threat of AI-enabled biological weapons and
high-tech autocracy can be used to create a permanent global
surveillance state. 

 MCP APPS AND INTERACTIVE UIS IN MCP CLIENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 MCP has evolved into a widely adopted industry standard, but
traditionally, its capabilities were confined to text-based
interactions. A new official extension, MCP Apps, now extends MCP to
support interactive user interfaces by layering HTML on top of the
existing protocol. These apps run securely in a sandboxed iframe, have
a bidirectional data flow, and are already available for use in
clients like Claude and Visual Studio Code.

QUICK LINKS

 CHATGPT CONTAINERS CAN NOW RUN BASH, PIP/NPM INSTALL PACKAGES, AND
DOWNLOAD FILES (10 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 ChatGPT's code execution container can now run Bash and other
languages, install packages via pip and npm, and download files
directly from the web. 

 PERFORMANCE HINTS (45 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 It is important to cultivate performance intuition from the start. 

 WHAT WE LEARNED FROM LEADERS BUILDING AGENTIC AI AT SCALE (7 MINUTE
READ) [23] 

 Research with AI engineering leaders shows that the biggest
challenges are experiential rather than model-related. 

 AFTER TWO YEARS OF VIBECODING, I'M BACK TO WRITING BY HAND (6 MINUTE
READ) [24] 

 AI-generated code for complex projects has no integrity and leads to
unmanageable "slop.”
