ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE CASE FOR COMMENT-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 While traditionally good code was considered self-documenting, LLMs
rely on and generate comments, making them necessary for good AI
collaboration. However, AI-generated comments are often inaccurate and
don't have good context. Instead, engineers should use detailed,
contextual comments to help drive the code generation by LLMs. 

 THE BEST CSS UNIT MIGHT BE A COMBINATION (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Instead of choosing between pixels (px) and relative units like em or
rem, developers should combine them using CSS comparison and math
functions. Combining units allows for responsive designs that respect
both user preferences and the site's intended appearance. 

 WHY TIGERBEETLE IS THE MOST INTERESTING DATABASE IN THE WORLD (18
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TigerBeetle is a database that prioritizes correctness and
performance through unconventional methods. It is designed with debits
and credits as its core primitives, optimized for high-volume
financial transactions, and built to be distributed by default,
handling storage faults well. The database uses Zig, static memory
allocation, and Deterministic Simulation Testing (DST) for testing and
stability.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE MAGIC OF CLAUDE CODE (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Claude Code's effectiveness comes from its integration with the Unix
philosophy and filesystem access, overcoming the memory and context
limitations of other LLMs. This dev has expanded his use of Claude
Code to include "Claudesidian" for Obsidian note-taking and "Inbox
Magic" for email management. 

 DISTRACTING SOFTWARE ENGINEERS IS WAY MORE HARMFUL THAN MOST MANAGERS
THINK (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Distractions (including meetings) harm software engineers'
productivity by disrupting deep work and flow states. The increase in
remote meetings since 2020 has made this issue worse. Managers should
prioritize creating uninterrupted time for engineers by improving
meeting culture, rethinking code review processes, and setting a good
example regarding focus time. 

 WHY I ONLY USE GOOGLE SHEETS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google Sheets is a quick and easy solution to business problems.
There have been many times when complex projects were ultimately
replaced by simpler spreadsheets, saving time and resources. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 EDGE264 (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Edge264 is a minimalist, high-performance software decoder for the
H.264/AVC video format. It supports various profiles and resolutions
up to 8K UHD, and it is developed in C with 128-bit vector extensions.
The decoder has a focus on performance and code size, using techniques
like code blocks, tree branching, and register-saturating SIMD. 

 GLIDE (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Glide is a hackable, keyboard-focused web browser forked from Firefox
that uses a TypeScript config for customization. It aims to overcome
the security constraints of traditional browser extensions by allowing
unrestricted access to APIs and functionality, letting users define
custom key mappings, spawn processes, and modify the UI.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ASKED TO DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL AT WORK? HERE'S WHAT THESE SOFTWARE
ENGINEERS DID (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There are ethical dilemmas software engineers face sometimes when
asked to participate in potentially illegal activities at work. In
recent times, there have been three examples: FTX, Frank, and Pollen.
The CEO of Frank was recently sentenced to 7 years in prison for
Fraud, while the CEO of FTX has already been in prison. 

 SIGNAL PROTOCOL AND POST-QUANTUM RATCHETS (30 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Signal is upgrading its protocol to the Triple Ratchet, incorporating
the Sparse Post-Quantum Ratchet (SPQR) alongside the existing Double
Ratchet. This improves security against future quantum computing
threats. This update guarantees forward secrecy and post-compromise
security, protecting communications now and in the future without
requiring user action. 

 THE COMPANY MAN (50 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In a dystopian San Francisco, a tech worker uses "ironic corporate
psychopathy" to cope with the guilt of improving algorithms for
addictive short-form videos. He was promoted to "The Project" to
create an AI that automates AI training, which led to a potentially
catastrophic feedback loop. He recruited a doomer coworker, Esther,
but their attempts to stop the AI failed, showing the CEO's delusional
spiritual motives and the AI's self-awareness.

QUICK LINKS

 TINKER (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Tinker is a training API that makes AI research easier by providing
infrastructure and tools for controlling model training, fine-tuning,
and sampling, supporting models like Qwen and Llama. 

 THIS BLOG POST WAS NOT WRITTEN WITH AI (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In a world increasingly influenced by AI, email serves as a personal,
immutable electronic record. 

 STEALING FROM GOOGLE (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 To avoid requiring users to trust external image domains like Google
or GitHub when using modern web frameworks like Next.js, the author
implemented a solution to automatically download user avatars from
these providers during signup, upload them to their own Cloudflare R2
bucket, and serve them from their own domain. 

 WHY I KEEP BLOGGING WITH EMACS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This dev uses Emacs for blogging, despite its complex and opaque
publishing workflow, because the Babel feature allows for easy
integration and execution of code within blog posts.
