 SKIP THE DOCS. LET AI ADD AUTH TO YOUR NEXT.JS APP (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Clerk's Next.js quickstart [4] includes a pre-built prompt you can
copy or open directly in Cursor, Claude, or ChatGPT. Your AI assistant
walks through the complete setup: installing the SDK, configuring
middleware, and adding auth components. No bouncing between docs and
your editor, no manual code copying, no missed configuration steps.
Just paste the prompt (or click to open) and go from empty project to
working authentication in one conversation.

 BUN IS JOINING ANTHROPIC (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bun, a high-performance JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package
manager, has been acquired by Anthropic. This acquisition provides Bun
with long-term stability and resources to focus on building the best
JavaScript tooling, especially for AI-driven software like Claude
Code. Bun will remain open-source, MIT-licensed, and developed in
public on GitHub by the same team, with continued focus on Node.js
compatibility and performance. 

 100,000 TPS OVER A BILLION ROWS: THE UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVENESS OF
SQLITE (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SQLite's embedded nature and single-writer limitation are usually
seen as drawbacks, but are actually important to its scalability. By
removing network latency and enabling batching, SQLite can achieve
much higher transactions per second (TPS) compared to networked
databases like Postgres, especially when dealing with power-law
distributed workloads and interactive transactions. This is shown by
benchmarks of SQLite reaching over 100,000 TPS even with concurrent
reads, while Postgres is much worse with added network latency.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE JUNIOR HIRING CRISIS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The tech industry is facing a hiring crisis in hiring junior-level
engineers due to AI automation replacing entry-level roles and senior
engineers not prioritizing mentorship. Universities are aware of
students struggling to find jobs, but they can't do much about it. As
a result, juniors should focus on developing their networks and their
interpersonal skills. 

 5 ENGINEERING LESSONS FROM REPLICATING AMAZON RDS POSTGRES WITH RUST
(28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Amazon RDS has a managed environment that imposes a unique set of
constraints which require non-trivial engineering solutions. Working
with the service is a constant exercise in navigating abstractions. It
requires building tools that are aware of the managed environment's
specific constraints and behaviors. The key is not to create RDS like
a black box.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 PROVE IT YOURSELF: PROD CLONE (DATA, FILES, SERVICES) IN SECONDS
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 Push a branch, get a custom preview env URL, same services, routes,
and fresh real data. See it happen in seconds, then try it on your
repo. No kubectl, no staging drift, just honest previews.

• See the prod-clone demo [10]

• Start free on Upsun [11]

 ZMX (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 zmx enables session persistence for terminal processes. It can attach
and detach from a shell session without killing it. Re-attaching a
session restores the previous terminal state and output. Multiple
clients can connect to the same session. 

 GO PROPOSAL: TYPE-SAFE ERROR CHECKING (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The new errors.AsType function in Go is a generic version of errors
that is type-safe, faster, and easier to use. errors.As has not been
deprecated yet, but errors.AsType is recommended for new code. AsType
can handle everything that As does, so it's a drop-in improvement for
new code. Code examples are available in the article.

 CAN WE BUILD WECHAT MINI APPS USING OPEN WEB STANDARDS? (10 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 WeChat is ubiquitous in China. The app allows users to access a wide
variety of services, including food delivery, ride hailing, and bike
rentals, without leaving the app. WeChat Mini apps prove that it's
sometimes a better customer experience to just scan a QR code rather
than using a native app. This article looks at how to create a WeChat
Mini app experience outside of WeChat using regular QR codes and open
web standards.

 ADDRESSING THE ADDING SITUATION (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Compilers use the x86's `lea` instruction for efficient three-operand
integer addition, using its memory addressing capabilities to overcome
the limitations of standard `add` instructions. 

 BILLIONS OF REQUESTS: BLACK FRIDAY-CYBER MONDAY 2025 (4 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Vercel's platform handled a record 115.8 billion requests during the
2025 Black Friday-Cyber Monday weekend. 

 AWS ANNOUNCES TRIO OF AUTONOMOUS AI AGENTS FOR DEVELOPERS (8 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 At AWS Re:Invent 2025, Amazon announced new AI agents (Kiro) for
software development, DevOps, and security, claiming they address the
issues of existing AI coding tools and improve efficiency. 

 ZIG'S NEW PLAN FOR ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMS (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Zig's new approach to asynchronous programming uses a generic `Io`
interface to hide asynchronous operations, allowing code to function
correctly with either synchronous or asynchronous I/O and providing
fine-grained control over execution.
