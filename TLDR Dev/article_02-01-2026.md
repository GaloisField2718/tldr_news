ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WEBASSEMBLY AS A PYTHON EXTENSION PLATFORM (13 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 WebAssembly (Wasm) is becoming a practical extension platform for
Python, allowing developers to write high-performance or specialized
code in other languages and distribute it without requiring native
toolchains. Implementing Wasm extensions requires careful attention to
memory management, correctly handling Wasm's unsigned pointers, and
working around certain API quirks like the `wasmtime` store's
instantiation limitations. Through examples like optimizing Python
hotspots and embedding a cryptography library, the author shows Wasm's
potential for improving Python application performance. 

 PYTHON NUMBERS EVERY PROGRAMMER SHOULD KNOW (16 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This is an extensive benchmark of Python's performance and memory
usage for various operations. It goes over the latency and memory
consumption of fundamental Python constructs, collections, I/O, web
frameworks, databases, and asynchronous processes. The data was
collected on a specific system with Python 3.14.2, and the source code
for benchmarks is openly available.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 10 PRIORITIZATION TRAPS (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In fast-paced startup environments, prioritization is a constant
struggle. Rather than making perfect decisions, teams should focus on
identifying and filtering out common pitfalls to make marginally
better choices and move forward. The article goes over various
anti-patterns, such as getting stuck in urgent but low-value tasks,
over-refining work, failing to fully commit to critical projects, and
neglecting long-term opportunities or systemic issues. 

 BESPOKE SOFTWARE IS THE FUTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Generalized, off-the-shelf software solutions often create
unnecessary complexity and "leakiness" by enforcing broad abstractions
for features most users don't need. Instead, the future is bespoke,
custom-tailored software, now that LLMs make the creation of software
much easier. This means that internal tooling becomes better and more
personalized for the company itself. 

 THE NEXT THING WILL NOT BE BIG (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The era of constantly seeking "The Next Big Thing" in technology may
be concluding as core innovations mature and markets saturate.
Historically, the 20th and early 21st centuries saw an anomalous pace
of technological change, but physical and economic limits are now
being reached. Consequently, the ongoing expectation for another
massive, industry-reshaping technology like AI might be misguided, as
future developments will be more incremental.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WELCOME TO GAS TOWN (34 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 "Gas Town” is a new AI orchestrator designed to manage and
coordinate 20-30 coding agents (like Claude Code) simultaneously. It
operates on a "Molecular Expression of Work" (MEOW) stack, using
Git-backed "Beads" to define persistent, composable workflows called
"molecules" that agents execute autonomously via the "Gas Town
Universal Propulsion Principle" (GUPP). Gas Town features a
sophisticated system of worker roles and patrols, similar to
Kubernetes for agents, to ensure continuous workflow completion even
with unpredictable AI behaviors. 

 OPENWORKERS (WEBSITE) [10] 

 OpenWorkers is an open-source runtime that allows devs to self-host
Cloudflare Workers-compatible JavaScript in V8 isolates. It provides
bindings for various services like KV storage, PostgreSQL, and S3,
alongside common Web APIs, all within a sandboxed environment with
resource limits and cron scheduling.

 SOFTWARE TAKETH AWAY FASTER THAN HARDWARE GIVETH: WHY C++ PROGRAMMERS
KEEP GROWING FAST DESPITE COMPETITION, SAFETY, AND AI (16 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Despite competition, C++ and Rust are the fastest-growing major
programming languages due to the principle that software demands
consistently outstrip hardware capabilities, driving a constant need
for efficient performance. This demand is increased even more by
critical computing constraints like power and chip supply, making
languages prioritizing "performance per watt" even more important. 

 USING ALTERNATIVE BROWSER ENGINES IN JAPAN (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple's iOS 26.2 and later now allows alternative browser engines for
users in Japan, applicable to both dedicated full browser apps and
in-app browsing experiences using an embedded engine. Developers must
obtain specific entitlements and meet certain criteria due to the high
security and privacy risks associated with browser engines, which
handle untrusted content and sensitive user data. Requirements cover
functional baselines, security practices like memory safety and timely
vulnerability fixes, and strict privacy standards such as blocking
cross-site cookies by default.

 BUILDING INTERNAL AGENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article goes over Imprint's journey in building internal AI
agents, covering technical challenges like skill support, context
management, triggers, and more, serving as a practical learning guide
for others. 

 I'M BRAVE ENOUGH TO SAY IT: LINUX IS GOOD NOW, AND IF YOU WANT TO
FEEL LIKE YOU ACTUALLY OWN YOUR PC, MAKE 2026 THE YEAR OF LINUX ON
(YOUR) DESKTOP (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Linux is now good and user-friendly, which has become increasingly
important in the face of Windows' more intrusive features being
introduced. 

 I WAS WRONG ABOUT TYPESCRIPT: PART 1 (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This dev, accustomed to strict type systems like Rust's, found
TypeScript's default lack of strictness frustrating, along with the
problematic `any` type and hidden runtime errors. 

 SLOWING DOWN AI ON PURPOSE (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A deliberate workflow where AI acts as a design partner, focused on
in-depth analysis and shared understanding through a living document
before generating any code, leads to much better software in the long
run.
