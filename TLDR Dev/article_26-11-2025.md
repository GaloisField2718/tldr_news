 GREPTILE'S AI CODE REVIEW BEATS CURSOR, COPILOT, AND CODERABBIT ON
BUG-CATCHING BENCHMARKS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Not everyone trusts AI to write code. But using it as a 2nd pair of
eyes to catch bugs that humans miss? That's a no brainer.

GREPTILE is trusted by 1,000 software companies and some of the top
open source repos [5] (NVIDIA, PostHog, Storybook). It AUTOMATICALLY
REVIEWS PRS in GitHub and GitLab with GRAPH-BASED CODEBASE CONTEXT. It
LEARNS FROM YOUR FEEDBACK to improve comments over time.

📊 When tested on 50 real world bugs, Greptile led with an 82% catch
rate -- 41% higher than Cursor (58%).

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE WEB ANIMATION PERFORMANCE TIER LIST (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post contains a tier-based ranking for web animation performance
techniques organized around how they interact with the browser's
render pipeline. S-Tier animations use compositor-thread properties,
like `transform`, `opacity`, and `filter`, that can run smoothly even
when the main thread is blocked, while lower tiers have increasingly
expensive operations like triggering paint (C-Tier) or layout
(D-Tier). Hardware-accelerated animations are generally best, but
there are important caveats like browser de-optimizations and GPU
memory limitations. 

 BRAND NEW LAYOUTS WITH CSS SUBGRID (30 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CSS Subgrid allows developers to extend CSS Grid layouts through the
DOM tree, enabling new UI possibilities and better semantic markup. It
allows nested elements to participate in the parent grid, solving
issues with nested layouts and sibling responsiveness. Devs can use
`grid-template-rows: subgrid` and `grid-template-columns: subgrid` to
inherit the grid template. 

 BACKGROUND CODING AGENTS: CONTEXT ENGINEERING (PART 2) (8 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Spotify's background coding agent uses advanced context engineering
to automatically edit code and create pull requests across thousands
of repositories. After experimenting with open-source agents and
building their own, Spotify's team found success with Claude Code by
crafting detailed, tailored prompts that describe end states rather
than step-by-step instructions, and by limiting the agent's tools to
maintain predictability.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 PYTHON IS NOT A GREAT LANGUAGE FOR DATA SCIENCE. PART 1: THE
EXPERIENCE (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Python is overused in data science and isn't inherently well-suited
for it, excluding deep learning. Students using Python often struggle
with tasks that are trivial in R. 

 WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU ABOUT MAINTAINING AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT (9
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Maintaining an open-source project like Kaneo is more than just
building it. It involves extensive documentation, user support, and
careful consideration of feature requests. Migrations can be
challenging, requiring rigorous testing and clear communication to
avoid data loss, but contributors are invaluable. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 PER-BRANCH, PRODUCTION-PERFECT PREVIEWS (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Every branch gets a live URL with prod-level services, routes, and
real data. Debug with real data, not a mock. Push, preview, merge with
confidence. Minimal YAML + one deploy hook, done. Reviewers see
exactly what ships. Fewer fire drills.

backend and React frontend tools, allowing access to customer billing
state using existing user IDs. 

 VUEFINDER (WEBSITE) [16] 

 VueFinder is a developer-friendly Vue 3 file manager offering
complete file operations and a beautiful, modern interface. It has

TypeScript, multiple languages and themes, and has flexible
configuration for easy backend integration.

 SOFTWARE FAILURES AND IT MANAGEMENT'S REPEATED MISTAKES (21 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Despite a massive increase in global IT spending, software project
success rates haven't improved significantly, leading to growing
business and societal costs due to pervasive failures. These failures
come from recurring issues like human error, unrealistic goals, and
inadequate risk management, often repeating past mistakes. Case
studies like the Phoenix payroll system and the UK Post Office's
Horizon system show the consequences of these failures, which include
financial losses, ruined lives, and a persistent lack of
accountability. 

 GOOGLE ANTIGRAVITY EXFILTRATES DATA (8 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 An indirect prompt injection can lead to data exfiltration in
Google's new agentic code editor, Antigravity. Attackers can
manipulate Gemini (Antigravity's AI) to collect sensitive credentials
and code snippets from the user's workspace by poisoning a seemingly
harmless file. Gemini then bypasses file access protections and uses a
browser subagent to transmit this data to an attacker-controlled site
via a crafted URL. 

 WHAT IS NEXT FOR YANN LECUN AFTER HIS DEPARTURE FROM META? (6 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 Yann LeCun, a Turing Award winner and pioneer of modern AI, will
leave his role as Meta's chief AI scientist by the end of the year to
start a new AI startup. LeCun has been vocal about the limitations of
LLMs and believes the AI community is headed in the wrong direction.
He doesn't believe that scaling LLMs will result in human-level AI.
His new startup will focus on developing AI systems that understand
the physical world through self-supervised learning and world models.

 WHAT NOW? HANDLING ERRORS IN LARGE SYSTEMS (6 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Error handling in large systems is complex, as the appropriate
response to an error depends on factors like failure correlation,
whether the error can be handled at a higher layer, and the
possibility of meaningful continuation.
