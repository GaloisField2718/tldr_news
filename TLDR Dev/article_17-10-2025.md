ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW I BYPASSED AMAZON'S KINDLE WEB DRM BECAUSE THEIR APP SUCKED (6
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This dev purchased an ebook from Amazon but was frustrated by the
buggy Kindle app and the inability to download the book for offline
reading or use with other reader apps. They reverse-engineered
Amazon's web DRM, fighting through multiple layers of obfuscation,
including randomized alphabets and fake font hints. The solution
involved pixel-perfect matching and perceptual hashing to decode the
glyphs and reconstruct the book's content, resulting in a tool that
can download purchased books and reconstruct them into perfectly
formatted EPUB files. 

 CREDENTIAL STUFFING (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Credential stuffing is an automated attack that uses stolen
username-password pairs from data breaches to gain unauthorized access
to user accounts on other services. Defending against this requires a
layered approach that combines strategies like multi-factor
authentication, breached password detection, rate limiting, device
cookies, behavioral analysis, CAPTCHAs, and risk-based authentication.


 WHY WE'RE LEAVING SERVERLESS (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Unkey moved from Cloudflare Workers to stateful Go servers to
overcome performance limitations and simplify their architecture. The
serverless environment's lack of persistent memory forced complex
caching workarounds and data pipeline overhead, resulting in high
latency. Switching to Go servers improved performance by 6x, removed
these complexities through in-memory batching, and allowed for
self-hosting.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW TO TAME A USER INTERFACE USING A SPREADSHEET (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Spreadsheets are a powerful, accessible user interface design tool.
They allow designers to focus on layout, positioning, and hierarchy
without the distractions of content and style. 

 MOST OF WHAT WE CALL PROGRESS (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Over time, good software engineers shift from valuing cleverness and
complexity to prioritizing clarity and stability. True personal
perspective progress is less caring about new technologies and more
about perspective, teamwork, and simple solutions. 

 HACKER NEWS - THE GOOD PARTS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hacker News prioritizes intellectually curious content, fosters a
self-moderating community guided by two human moderators, and promotes
discussions that are informative and surprising. The platform
encourages humility and focuses on delivering signal over noise,
making it a unique social network for intellectual growth.
