 DICTATING CODE SHOULDN'T FEEL LIKE DEBUGGING IT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Voice coding doesn't work when the AI mangles your syntax and you
need to break flow to fix it. What does work? Wispr Flow [4] -
speech-to-text designed for developers:

 	* SUPPORTS EVERY IDE. Press a button, code out loud. System-level
integration means zero setup.
 	* UNDERSTANDS CODE SYNTAX AND TECHNICAL TERMS [4]. Dictate
_async/await_, _useEffect_, or _try/catch._ Get exactly what you said.
 	* 89% SENT WITH ZERO EDITS. Flow formats perfectly, removes filler
words, and produces ready-to-ship code.
 	* 4X FASTER THAN TYPING. PR descriptions, document APIs, Slack
replies... Flow handles everything.

Join 100K developers who stopped writing code - and started dictating
it.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 COMPOUND ENGINEERING: MAKE EVERY UNIT OF WORK COMPOUND INTO THE NEXT
(40 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Compound Engineering is an AI-native philosophy designed to make each
unit of engineering work easier for subsequent tasks. Aiming to
fundamentally change how software is built, its core process involves
a four-step loop: Plan, Work, Review, and Compound. The "Compound"
stage helps with continuous improvement and knowledge codification
within the system. This method prevents complexity accumulation by
teaching the system new capabilities and capturing insights, making
codebases progressively easier to understand, modify, and trust. 

 TWO DIFFERENT TRICKS FOR FAST LLM INFERENCE (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic and OpenAI have both introduced "fast mode" for their
coding LLMs, using distinct strategies to accelerate inference.
Anthropic's method offers moderate speed increases (up to 2.5x) by
optimizing low-batch-size inference, serving its full Opus 4.6 model
at a higher cost. In contrast, OpenAI has faster speeds (15x) by using
specialized Cerebras chips and deploying a new, smaller, and less
capable model called GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark. 

 SCALING LLM POST-TRAINING AT NETFLIX (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Netflix has developed an internal Post-Training Framework to
effectively scale the adaptation of LLMs for improving member
experiences in areas like recommendations and search. This framework
addresses critical engineering challenges encountered when fine-tuning
production-grade LLMs, including complex data pipelines, distributed
GPU coordination, and intricate multi-stage training workflows. It
offers modular components for managing data, models, compute, and
diverse workflows, supporting methods from supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) to advanced reinforcement learning (RL).

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE AI VAMPIRE (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The AI Vampire phenomenon is where AI tools like Claude Code increase
productivity but also drain employees, leading to widespread fatigue
and burnout. This arises because companies capture most of the
AI-generated value, while the addictive nature of agentic software and
unrealistic productivity standards set by early adopters intensify the
pressure to overwork. Individuals face a dilemma: overwork to keep
pace and suffer exhaustion, or risk being left behind by an
accelerating, extraction-focused work culture driven by both
enterprises and frenzied AI-native startups. 

 TASTE IS NOT A MOAT (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI is progressing fast, quickly absorbing tasks once thought to
require human taste and judgment, turning taste into a decaying
"alpha" rather than a durable "moat." The baseline of AI capabilities
is rising so fast that human taste is valuable only relative to what
AI can already produce, an advantage that constantly diminishes.
Consequently, the human role is shifting towards "taste extraction,"
where individuals articulate and encode their judgment into AI systems
to steer outputs and maintain leverage. 

 DAYS OF MIRACLE AND WONDER (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Many people, particularly critics, have lost their capacity for
genuine wonder at recent technological advancements, instead focusing
on skepticism and preventing acknowledgment of progress. It's better
to maintain both skepticism and a sense of awe for what has been
accomplished when it comes to AI.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GITHUB COPILOT FOR ALL: ACCELERATING YOUR SOFTWARE INNOVATION PROCESS
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Accelerate software innovation on any platform or code repository
with GitHub Copilot for All, the agentic AI software development tool
meeting you where you are. Integrate GitHub Copilot into any team or
toolchain, then tailor agentic development across the enterprise with
flexible plans and customizations that meet your needs.

 OAT (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Oat UI is an ultra-lightweight, zero-dependency UI library built with
vanilla HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. It uses semantic HTML and
accessibility by styling native elements directly without classes,
enforcing best practices and reducing markup pollution. 

 ROWBOAT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Rowboat is an open-source AI coworker that builds a long-lived
knowledge graph from your email and meeting notes. It uses this
accumulating context to help you with tasks like drafting documents,
preparing for meetings, and generating reports. A key differentiator
is its local-first design, storing all data as editable Markdown notes
directly on your machine.

 OPENCLAW, OPENAI, AND THE FUTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Peter Steinberger announced he is joining OpenAI to work on making AI
agents accessible to everyone. As a "builder at heart," he believes
teaming with OpenAI is the fastest way to achieve his vision for
widespread, safe AI adoption, rather than focusing on building another
large company. His personal project, OpenClaw, which has gotten
significant attention, will transition into a foundation. 

 WHY STRIPE PAID $1B FOR METRONOME INSTEAD OF FIXING BILLING (7 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Stripe acquired Metronome for $1 billion because its existing billing
system, designed for traditional SaaS subscriptions, couldn't handle
the real-time, high-volume usage metering and complex pricing models
required by modern AI and other event-driven businesses. Stripe
Billing's architecture fundamentally relies on pre-aggregated data
pushed via HTTP, making it unsuitable for the event streaming and
progressive billing necessary for these new models. Rebuilding their
core system to support an event-first architecture would have involved
a multi-year, breaking change with significant migration risks, making
acquisition a more economically rational choice. 

 ARMING THE REBELS WITH GPUS: GRADIUM, KYUTAI, AND AUDIO AI (19 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Small, underfunded audio AI startups are surprisingly outperforming
major tech companies in developing cutting-edge, real-time
conversational audio models. This success is from audio AI being
historically overlooked by big labs and demanding deep domain
expertise rather than just massive compute and data. Small teams
benefit from audio models being cheaper to train and thriving on
clever architectural innovations.
