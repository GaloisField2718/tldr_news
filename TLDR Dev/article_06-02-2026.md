 BUILDING A C COMPILER WITH A TEAM OF PARALLEL CLAUDES (14 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Anthropic tasked a team of 16 parallel Claude Opus 4.6 agents to
autonomously build a Rust-based C compiler capable of compiling the
Linux kernel. Over two weeks and $20,000 in API costs, the agent team
produced a 100,000-line compiler that can build Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM,
and RISC-V. 

 A BROKEN HEART (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A web app dashboard mysteriously became ten times slower. When
initial fixes failed, deeper investigation using Safari's performance
inspector found that "Layout" was consuming 94% of the CPU time, only
on Safari. A binary search process aided by Claude pinpointed the
cause: a single heart emoji rendered via the "Noto Color Emoji" Google
font, which suffered from extremely slow SVG rendering fallback on
Apple platforms.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 GITHUB ACTIONS IS SLOWLY KILLING YOUR ENGINEERING TEAM (21 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 GitHub Actions is a flawed Continuous Integration system, favored
only for its convenience within GitHub. It has an unreliable and
frustrating log viewer, an overly complex YAML syntax, inherent
security risks with its Marketplace actions, and slow, uncustomizable
cloud runners. 

 MY AI ADOPTION JOURNEY (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Agents are great for coding, end-of-day research, and for outsourcing
"slam dunk" tasks. Also, "harness engineering" helps improve agent
reliability.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CLAUDE OPUS 4.6 (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Anthropic has launched Claude Opus 4.6, an upgraded model better at
coding, debugging, and reasoning skills, while having a 1M token
context window in beta. This model has state-of-the-art performance on
various benchmarks, including agentic coding and complex reasoning
tests. 

 INTRODUCING GPT-5.3-CODEX (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI has launched GPT-5.3-Codex with much improved coding
performance with professional knowledge capabilities while operating
25% faster. This model is great at long-running tasks like research
and complex execution, and it sets new industry benchmarks across
coding, web development, and general computer use. 

 ORCHESTRATE TEAMS OF CLAUDE CODE SESSIONS (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Claude Code's experimental Agent Teams feature allows multiple AI
instances to collaborate on complex tasks, with a lead agent
coordinating work and synthesizing results. Unlike subagents, agent
teams collaborate and discuss among each other, making them great for
tasks requiring shared problem-solving.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW I TURNED MY ANKI SIDE PROJECT INTO A KICKSTARTER: A WALKTHROUGH
(23 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Kanjideck was started as an Anki side project in August 2024 to
create a better resource for learning Japanese Kanji, which soon
expanded into developing a physical card deck and launching a
business. This involved navigating manufacturing challenges, setting
up a US company via Stripe Atlas due to Kickstarter country
restrictions, and planning pricing and digital infrastructure. 

 COMPANY AS CODE (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 "Company as Code" is a programmatic representation of the entire
organization, similar to Infrastructure as Code. This system would use
a declarative language to define roles, units, policies, and their
relationships, creating a dynamic, queryable, and version-controlled
graph model. This makes it easier to have testable policy changes and
make the “company” controllable through AI agents.
