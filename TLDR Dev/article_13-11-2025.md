 TESTS ARE DEAD, SHIP FASTER WITH 100% COVERAGE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Meticulous is the world's first automated testing platform [4] that
covers every edge case in your web app without you writing a single
test.

HOW IT WORKS: Meticulous observes your app in the background and
automatically builds a continuously evolving suite of E2E UI tests
that covers every possible flow and ensures exhaustive coverage.

It feels like magic:

 	* 100% code coverage on every test run
 	* No test creation
 	* No maintenance (seriously) [4]
 	* Zero flakes 

Top engineering teams like Dropbox, Notion and Wiz can't imagine
working without it.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE WRITE LAST, READ FIRST RULE (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TigerBeetle, a financial transactions database, uses a system of
record and a system of reference (Postgres) to maintain consistency in
the absence of transactions. The "Write Last, Read First" principle
guarantees data integrity by writing to the system of record last and
reading from it first. Idempotent operations are necessary, as the
application uses a durable execution framework (Distributed Async
Await) that guarantees eventual completion through checkpointing and
resumption. 

 STYLEX: A STYLING LIBRARY FOR CSS AT SCALE (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 StyleX is Meta's default, open-source styling system. Designed for
large-scale applications, it combines the ease of CSS-in-JS with the
performance of static CSS generation. StyleX compiles styles at build
time into atomic CSS. It enforces constraints to avoid conflict-prone
patterns, like styling at a distance, to guarantee style
encapsulation. 

 ZIG / C++ INTEROP (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Zig and C++ interoperability means that both languages can store each
other's data types. A macro called `SIZED_OPAQUE` can be used to
define opaque types with specified sizes and alignments, enabling type
embedding and compile-time size verification. Pointers can be used for
passing types between languages, and C++ functions can be used for
managing types in Zig.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN THE TIME OF STRANGE NEW ANGELS (19 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Agentic AI has fundamentally altered software development by making
code production cheap and fast. This has shifted the bottleneck from
coding to knowing what to build. Developers and organizations can
adapt by prioritizing skills like architecture, testing, and business
acumen. 

 HOW I FELL IN LOVE WITH ERLANG (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 When this dev first started programming, they were confused about
various concepts, like recursion. They then had years of learning
through trial and error with C and Linux, followed by a breakthrough
understanding of recursion through Prolog. This led them to discover
Erlang, a functional and distributed language, through a conversation
at a bridge tournament, where they fell in love with Erlang's
message-passing system and fault-tolerant design.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 IS YOUR APP READY FOR BLACK FRIDAY'S TRAFFIC SURGE? SENTRY HAS A
HOLIDAY MONITORING CHECKLIST FOR YOU (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Nothing quite matches the terror of a checkout error at 11:59 PM —
on Black Friday. Holiday readiness [11] starts with capturing errors
in prod, but it extends to session replays, smart error alerting, and
issue triage. Read Sentry's post [11]to get the complete checklist and
prepare for peak web traffic. 

 STEAM HARDWARE (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Valve is expanding its Steam Hardware family in 2026 with new
hardware like the Stream Frame (VR goggles) and the Steam Machine (a
powerful PC). These devices will be powered by SteamOS, so they will
have seamless integration with the Steam platform and access to
Steam's large game library. 

 VISUAL STUDIO 2026 IS HERE: FASTER, SMARTER, AND A HIT WITH EARLY
ADOPTERS (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Visual Studio 2026 is now generally available. The update includes
performance improvements, a redesigned user experience, and better
AI-driven development. Visual Studio 2026 is AI-native. It offers
intelligent assistance during debugging, profiling, and modernization
along with new C# and C++ agents. 

 JSX TOOL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 JSX Tool is a Chrome extension that bridges the gap between the
Element Inspector and React Component Selector, allowing direct
styling of JSX in a live browser setting. It functions as a full IDE
within the browser, allowing users to find and edit any line of JSX,
tweak CSS in-memory, and prompt LLMs with full context for style
changes.

 ANDROID DEVELOPER VERIFICATION: EARLY ACCESS STARTS NOW AS WE
CONTINUE TO BUILD WITH YOUR FEEDBACK (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google has announced early access to its new Android developer
verification process, designed to improve user safety by combating
scams and malware. This verification requires developers to use a real
identity. Based on community feedback, Google is creating a dedicated
account type for students and hobbyists with limited distribution
needs, and a new advanced flow for experienced users who are
comfortable installing unverified apps. 

 TESTING OUT CRUSH, A TUI BASED CODING AGENT (IN NEOVIM BTW) (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Crush is a TUI-based AI coding agent from Charm. While it is
intuitive and has a model-agnostic approach, it has a high cost of API
usage, especially with premium models.
