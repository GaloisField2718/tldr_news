 REPORT: 96% OF DEVS DON'T FULLY TRUST AI CODE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI is accelerating code generation, but it's creating a bottleneck in
the verification phase. Based on a survey of 1,100+ developers,
Sonar's newest State of Code report analyzes the impact of generative
AI on software engineering workflows and how developers are adapting
to address it.

Findings include: 

	* 96% of developers don't fully trust that AI-generated code is
functionally correct yet only 48% always check it before committing
	* 61% agree that AI often produces code that looks correct but isn't
reliable
	* 24% of a developer's work week is spent on toil work

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 RUST AT SCALE: AN ADDED LAYER OF SECURITY FOR WHATSAPP (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 WhatsApp added a layer of security for three billion users by
replacing 160,000 lines of C++ with 90,000 lines of Rust. This global
deployment, called Kaleidoscope, mitigates memory safety
vulnerabilities in media processing. The cross-platform migration
improved performance and runtime memory usage across Android, iOS, and
web clients. 

 HOW CURSOR SHIPPED ITS CODING AGENT TO PRODUCTION (12 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Cursor's team shipped Composer, a coding agent that completes most
tasks in under 30 seconds, by solving three gnarly engineering
problems: the “diff problem” (models aren't great at making clean
code edits, so they trained specifically on edit trajectories and
search-replace operations), compounded latency (each step in the agent
loop adds delay, so they used MoE architecture, speculative decoding
with draft models, and aggressive context compaction to stay fast),
and sandboxing at scale (they built custom VM infrastructure to spin
up thousands of isolated execution environments without the startup
time becoming a bottleneck).

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 A FEW RANDOM NOTES FROM CLAUDE CODING QUITE A BIT LAST FEW WEEKS (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Andrej Karpathy has had a rapid shift in their coding workflow,
moving from 80% manual to 80% LLM agent-driven programming within
weeks. While LLMs boost productivity, stamina, and project scope by
handling code generation, they still produce subtle conceptual errors,
overcomplicate code, and necessitate close human oversight within an
IDE. Despite these flaws, the LLM-assisted workflow makes coding more
enjoyable by removing drudgery and expanding engineering capabilities.


 WE'RE ALL BEGINNERS AGAIN (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Early AI adoption mirrors the early Python ecosystem, restoring play
to programming. Since no definitive advanced standards exist,
developers should embrace experimentation over legacy maintenance.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 💣 V0 BY VERCEL IS VIBE CODING WITHOUT THE SECURITY TIME BOMB
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 Most AI coding tools optimize for speed and novelty, which risks
leaked credentials and company data. Need something that can actually
go to prod? v0 [9] is built on the same infrastructure that's handled
hundreds of millions of deployments and blocked hundreds of billions
of threats in the last year. Start here [9] 

 OPEN CODING AGENTS: FAST, ACCESSIBLE CODING AGENTS THAT ADAPT TO ANY
REPO (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ai2 has launched Open Coding Agents, an initiative to address the
limitations of existing closed and expensive coding agent systems.
They are releasing SERA (Soft-verified Efficient Repository Agents), a
family of strong open coding models and an accessible training method.
This method significantly reduces the cost and complexity of
fine-tuning powerful coding agents on private codebases, allowing
small teams to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Ultimately, Ai2
aims to democratize access to agentic coding, making it more
reproducible and adaptable for researchers and developers worldwide. 

 PRISM (WEBSITE) [11] 

 OpenAI has launched Prism, a free, AI-native workspace to accelerate
science writing and collaboration for researchers. Powered by GPT-5.2,
this cloud-based, LaTeX-native platform integrates drafting, revision,
collaboration, and preparation for publication into a single workflow.

MISCELLANEOUS

 FROM PROMPTS TO CLICKS: SHIPPING MCP APPS IN PRODUCTION (17 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Monday.com has successfully implemented MCP Apps, an extension to the
Model Context Protocol, allowing AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude to
return interactive UI components directly within chat conversations.
This approach enables users to "ask, see, and act" on information
without leaving the chat, but it's important to only show UI
selectively where seeing beats reading. 

 AGENTS.MD OUTPERFORMS SKILLS IN OUR AGENT EVALS (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI coding agents struggle with outdated framework knowledge, leading
to incorrect code generation. Researchers from Vercel evaluated two
approaches for providing current Next.js API documentation: "skills"
(on-demand knowledge packages) and "AGENTS.md" (a persistent, embedded
markdown file). Surprisingly, a compressed 8KB docs index embedded
directly in AGENTS.md achieved a perfect 100% pass rate in their
evals, outperforming skills, which only reached 79% even with explicit
triggering instructions.

 DOING THE THING IS DOING THE THING (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Only actual execution, even if imperfect, constitutes "doing the
thing," as opposed to contemplation, planning, or discussion. 

 CLAWDBOT RENAMES TO MOLTBOT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Clawdbot has been renamed to Moltbot due to the original name being
too close to “Claude,” which is trademarked. 

 THE AGE OF PUMP AND DUMP SOFTWARE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A worrying new trend in 2026 is where easily generated,
unmaintainable vibe-coded software is used by crypto scammers and tech
FOMO for pump and dump schemes involving associated cryptocurrencies. 

 ONE HUMAN + ONE AGENT = ONE BROWSER FROM SCRATCH (7 MINUTE READ) [17]


 Working with a single LLM agent, the author successfully built a
basic, cross-platform HTML/CSS browser from scratch in approximately
70 hours and without third-party Rust dependencies.
