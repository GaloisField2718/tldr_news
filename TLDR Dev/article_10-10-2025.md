 REAL-TIME VIDEO GENERATION IS FINALLY HERE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Until now, real-time generative video wasn't possible.
Latency and compute limits made live editing a far dream.

With Decart's open-weights Lucy-Edit model [4], you can transform your
videos with text, edit specific elements or subjects live, and see
every change right away.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW FACEBOOK'S DISTRIBUTED PRIORITY QUEUE HANDLES TRILLIONS OF ITEMS
(8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Facebook's Distributed Priority Queue (FOQS) is a horizontally
scalable system built on sharded MySQL that handles trillions of queue
operations daily for various background tasks like notifications,
video encoding, and language translation. The system organizes work
into namespaces (for multi-tenancy), topics (logical priority queues),
and items (individual tasks with priority, payload, and timing
metadata), allowing different services to process asynchronous
workloads in isolation. 

 PYTHON 3.14 IS HERE. HOW FAST IS IT? (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 When Python 3.14 is benchmarked against previous versions using
single and multi-threaded Fibonacci and bubble sort scripts, it shows
improvement over previous CPython versions, especially since version
3.11. However, the JIT interpreter in 3.14 doesn't offer noticeable
gains, while the free-threading interpreter has improved performance
in CPU-heavy, multi-threaded scenarios. 

 THE DISCIPLINE OF CONSTRAINTS: WHAT ELM TAUGHT ME ABOUT REACT'S
USEREDUCER (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Elm has strictly enforced constraints, while React gives developers a
lot of freedom to make mistakes. While both Elm and React solve state
management through similar patterns, Elm's compiler prevents errors
like unhandled cases and improper effect management, whereas React
allows developers to use escape hatches like default cases and loose
typing that can lead to bugs. Elm's constraints teach valuable
discipline that can be intentionally applied to React development
through practices like strict typing, proper action handling, and
designing invalid states out of existence.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 EMBRACING THE PARALLEL CODING AGENT LIFESTYLE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Using multiple coding agents in parallel can improve productivity.
This approach is great for research tasks like proof-of-concepts and
understanding existing code, as well as small, low-stakes maintenance
tasks like fixing warnings. Carefully specified tasks result in easier
code review and less buggy code overall. 

 REFLECTIONS ON BIG TECH (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Big Tech companies, like Google, Facebook, and even OpenAI, have
become all-consuming entities that thrive by feeding on our attention,
turning us into the product. This creates an environment of addiction,
inequality, and unhappiness, distracting us from real-world issues and
our own lives. 

 FROM MANAGER TO IC, WHY SOFT SKILLS MATTER MORE THAN EVER (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Soft skills become increasingly important as engineers advance to
senior and staff levels. There are four main soft skills that make
engineers more effective: networking to build relationships and create
opportunities, communication to articulate complex concepts and
understand team challenges, being supportive to act as a force
multiplier for others, and being outspoken to advocate for good
practices even when uncomfortable.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING THE REACT FOUNDATION: THE NEW HOME FOR REACT & REACT
NATIVE (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Meta has announced the creation of the React Foundation, which will
serve as the new independent home for React, React Native, and related
projects. The React Foundation will have a governing board with
representatives from major tech companies, including Amazon,
Microsoft, Meta, and others, while maintaining separate technical
governance driven by React's maintainers and contributors. Meta is
committing over $3 million in funding and dedicated engineering
support over five years. 

 JETSKI (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Jetski is an open-source MCP analytics and authentication platform.
It has prompt analytics, auto-generated setup instructions, zero-code
authentication, and real-time debug logs to help make analyzing MCP
usage easier. 

 SEARCH INPUT QUERY (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Search Input Query is a search query language parser and a React
component, inspired by Elasticsearch and Tantivy. It has features like
type checking, comprehensive validation, error reporting, and a React
component with Monaco editor integration. It's fully configurable and
has SQL conversion capabilities too.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A SMALL NUMBER OF SAMPLES CAN POISON LLMS OF ANY SIZE (11 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 A study by Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan
Turing Institute found that injecting as few as 250 malicious
documents can create backdoors in LLMs, regardless of their size or
training data volume. This challenges the assumption that attackers
need to control a large percentage of training data, showing that
poisoning attacks are more feasible than previously thought. The study
focused on a denial-of-service attack causing gibberish output, and
the researchers found that attack success depended on the absolute
number of poisoned documents, not their proportion in the training
data. 

 HUGE DATABREACH OF VIBECODED SYSTEM IN MY CITY! (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Localmind, a software company, suffered a massive data breach due to
critical security flaws in its system from supposed vibe-coding.
Creating a demo account granted full root access to servers, exposing
data from over 150 organizations, including banks and energy
companies. However, since passwords within their internal knowledge
database were stored in plain text, commenters believe that this issue
was due to human error, as AI would not recommend storing passwords in
plain text. 

 THE STATE OF AI ADOPTION IN ENGINEERING TEAMS 📊 (8 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 A survey of 435 engineers and engineering managers shows that 77% use
AI daily for personal work, mainly for coding and automating
repetitive tasks. However, team-level adoption is still largely
unstructured, with most organizations providing tool access without
establishing shared practices or workflows.

 GITHUB WILL PRIORITIZE MIGRATING TO AZURE OVER FEATURE DEVELOPMENT (4
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 GitHub is prioritizing a complete infrastructure migration to Azure
within the next 24 months to address capacity constraints and scale
for AI demands, even if it means delaying new feature development. 

 CONCURRENT HYDRATION WITH USESYNCEXTERNALSTORE (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 To avoid hydration mismatches and improve performance when using
Suspense with server-side rendering in React, wrap
`useSyncExternalStore` with `useDeferredValue` to enable concurrent
rendering, prevent fallback flashes, and improve the responsiveness of
interactions. 

 TIL: PYTHON'S SPLITLINES DOES A LOT MORE THAN JUST NEWLINES (1 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 Python's `str.splitlines()` method splits strings based on a wide
range of Unicode line boundary characters, including more than just
the common newline characters. 

 WHY SELF-HOST? (9 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Self-hosting personal services like calendar, contacts, email, smart
home, RSS feeds, and location tracking helps one regain privacy,
sovereignty, and control over personal data, escaping reliance on Big
Tech.
