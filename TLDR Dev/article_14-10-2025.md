ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FROM MILLIONS TO BILLIONS (15 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Geocodio needed to scale its request logging from millions to
billions of requests monthly for billing and customer support, but its
deprecated MariaDB setup with TokuDB was struggling. Its initial
attempt to replace MariaDB with ClickHouse directly resulted in
"TOO_MANY_PARTS" errors due to small, frequent inserts, and a
subsequent attempt using ClickHouse buffer tables led to
"TOO_MANY_LINKS" errors. The solution involved introducing Kafka for
durable storage and high throughput and Vector to efficiently batch
and load data from Kafka into ClickHouse. 

 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ARE A LEGACY MESS: LET'S DIVE DEEP INTO THEM (9
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Environment variables are a flat, global dictionary of strings passed
from parent to child processes through the `execve` system call. When
a new program is launched, the kernel places these variables on the
stack as null-terminated strings, which the program then copies into
its own data structure (like a hashmap in Bash or an array in glibc).
While the Linux kernel and glibc are liberal about the format of
environment variables, it's generally recommended to use uppercase
letters, digits, and underscores for names, and UTF-8 encoding for
values to avoid potential issues. 

 15 RECENT NODE.JS FEATURES THAT REPLACE POPULAR NPM PACKAGES (8
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Node.js has evolved to include many features that previously required
third-party npm packages, reducing dependency bloat. This post covers
fifteen recent Node.js features that replace popular packages,
including the global fetch() API (replacing node-fetch), built-in test
runner (replacing mocha/jest), native WebSocket support, file system
utilities like fs.glob() and recursive operations, and various other
utilities for styling text, generating UUIDs, and handling URLs.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 TWO THINGS LLM CODING AGENTS ARE STILL BAD AT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LLM coding agents still feel awkward to work with due to two main
issues: they don't copy-paste code like humans do (instead
"remembering" and rewriting code from memory), and they're terrible at
asking clarifying questions, preferring to make assumptions and
brute-force solutions. These quirks make LLMs feel more like "weird,
overconfident interns" rather than replacements for human developers. 

 ABSTRACTION, NOT SYNTAX (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While alternatives to YAML are welcome, the focus should shift from
superficial syntax improvements to configuration languages that allow
for loops, variables, and formulas, like RCL. While these
configuration languages introduce new trade-offs, such as needing an
intermediate build step and possibly hurting greppability, the
benefits of abstraction outweigh the costs for complex configurations.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NITRO (WEBSITE) [9] 

 Nitro is a next-generation server toolkit for building and deploying
web servers with TypeScript. It supports development with hot module
replacement, zero-config deployment to any provider, and a compact
output size. 

 STEEL BROWSER (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Steel is an open-source browser API for building AI agents and apps
that interact with the web. It has features like full browser control
using Puppeteer, session management, proxy support, extension support,
debugging tools, anti-detection measures, and resource management.
Devs can interact with the API through sessions, quick actions, and
SDKs in Node and Python for tasks like web scraping, screenshots, and
PDF generation. 

 JSON RIVER (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 JSON River is a lightweight JavaScript library for parsing JSON
incrementally from streams. It provides a sequence of increasingly
complete JSON values as they arrive. The library prioritizes
correctness, matching JSON.parse behavior and throwing errors on
invalid input, and has been tested against the JSONTestSuite.

 LLMS ARE GETTING BETTER AT CHARACTER-LEVEL TEXT MANIPULATION (7
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 LLMs are getting better at character-level text manipulation, such as
character replacement, counting, and decoding ciphers. Newer LLMs like
GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 show improved performance in these tasks
compared to older generations, suggesting a better understanding of
algorithms beyond simple memorization. This article tests models on
Base64 and ROT20 encoded text, showing that larger models are more
successful at tasks like decoding and character substitution, even
with gibberish text. 

 THREE WAYS FORMALLY VERIFIED CODE CAN GO WRONG IN PRACTICE (8 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Formally verified code, despite being "correct" according to
specifications, can still contain bugs in practice. These bugs arise
from three main issues: invalid proofs, incorrect properties being
verified, and wrong assumptions made during the verification process.
"Correctness" in formal methods refers to conformity with a
specification, which may not always align with real-world expectations
or cover all potential issues.

QUICK LINKS

 SQLITE ONLINE (WEBSITE) [14] 

 A quick, simple, visual way to use, test, and host SQLite databases
online. 

 NANOCHAT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Nanochat is a minimal, hackable, full-stack implementation of a
ChatGPT-like LLM designed to be trained and run on a single machine
for around $100 created by Andrej Karpathy, part of OpenAI's founding
team. 

 THE LLMENTALIST EFFECT: HOW CHAT-BASED LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS
REPLICATE THE MECHANISMS OF A PSYCHIC'S CON (28 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The perceived intelligence of LLMs is an illusion where statistically
generic responses are misinterpreted as specifically intelligent and
relevant due to subjective validation. 

 IGNORE PREVIOUS DIRECTIONS 8: DEVOPSDAYS (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Containers have evolved from solving application management
challenges to being the basis of a complex Kubernetes landscape,
leading to both increased efficiency and new forms of resource wastage
across the board.
