 GOODBYE, LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native solution provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA
cycle to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks [6]—not years
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs [7]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of engineers [8] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 LOGGING SUCKS (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Traditional logging is inadequate for modern, distributed systems,
usually providing little useful context for debugging issues. A shift
to "wide events" or canonical log lines, which are single,
comprehensive log entries emitted per request per service, may solve
this problem. These events are rich in high-cardinality and
high-dimensionality data, allowing for powerful queries and analytics
instead of string searches. 

 SCALING LLMS TO LARGER CODEBASES (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Scaling LLMs within large codebases requires investments in both
guidance and oversight. Guidance focuses on providing LLMs with
high-quality context, such as prompt libraries and well-structured,
modular codebases, to allow for efficient "one-shot" code generation
without needing a lot of rework. Oversight refers to human engineers
who validate LLM choices, making sure of architectural integrity and
aligned solutions.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 EVERYONE IS A STAFF ENGINEER NOW (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI coding agents have become so good that they have fundamentally
transformed software engineering, making code implementation
inexpensive. This means engineers are increasingly expected to focus
on higher-level skills like architectural judgment, system-level
thinking, and managing complex contexts across multiple domains. Devs
will need to start adapting their workflows, including planning and
steering AI agents and developing habits to maintain focus amidst
asynchronous work. 

 A YEAR OF VIBES (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In 2025, this dev left Sentry, launched a new company, and shifted
his programming approach to embrace hands-off agentic coding with
tools like Claude Code. He became deeply integrated with AI agents for
tasks from code generation to daily organization. However, he's
sometimes worried about emergent human-like tendencies of LLMs,
questioning terms like "agent.” 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WHAT IF YOU WENT ALL IN ON AI FOR 1,000 HOURS? (SPONSOR) [14] 

 You're already using AI. Agents, RAG, fine-tuning are part of your
workflow. Now, it's time to take the next step: Gauntlet [14] brings
cracked engineers into a 10-week, 1,000-hour fellowship. Fully funded
by companies hiring from the cohort. Graduates don't job hunt: they
leave with $200K+ offers. Apply to Cohort 4 [14]. 

 TAMBO (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Tambo AI is a Generative UI SDK for React. It allows AI to
dynamically render components based on natural language conversations.
Components are defined with Zod schemas, which the AI then uses to
generate one-time elements or manage persistent, interactable UI. 

 COCOINDEX (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 CocoIndex is a fast data transformation framework for AI. It uses a
dataflow programming model, with plug-and-play building blocks and
guaranteed data freshness through incremental processing and data
lineage. 

 SNITCH (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 snitch is a prettier way to inspect network connections. It enables
users to inspect network connections with a clean tui or styled
tables. Examples are available in the repository.

MISCELLANEOUS

 I'M A FORMER CTO. HERE IS THE 15 SEC CODING TEST I USED TO INSTANTLY
FILTER OUT 50% OF UNQUALIFIED APPLICANTS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A 15-second coding test with a hidden character trick filters out 50%
of unqualified remote job applicants, as good candidates would solve
the code mentally, while others using interpreters or AI would get an
incorrect answer. 

 YOUR SUPABASE IS PUBLIC (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This dev frequently finds Supabase projects with exposed credentials,
which, due to a lack of proper Row Level Security (RLS), grant full
access to sensitive user data within the database. This vulnerability
is surprisingly common. It allows simple `curl` requests to retrieve
all user information from unprotected tables. While users are
responsible for RLS, Supabase's design could be improved with clearer
warnings or default secure configurations to prevent the anon key from
becoming a master key.

QUICK LINKS

 WELL BEING IN TIMES OF ALGORITHMS (12 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Reclaiming well-being from the attention-grabbing algorithms of big
tech calls for a return to an open internet and a focus on fundamental
life pillars like health, family, and self-contentment. 

 I PROGRAM ON THE SUBWAY (5 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 This dev programs on the subway during their commute to reclaim time
for side projects, finding benefits from the focused, distraction-free
environment. 

 YOU CAN'T OPT-OUT OF ACCESSIBILITY (11 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Web accessibility is a fundamental human responsibility that is
currently neglected and not properly addressed by the industry. 

 THINGS I LEARNT ABOUT PASSKEYS WHEN BUILDING PASSKEYBOT (11 MINUTE
READ) [23] 

 passkeybot is a hosted sign-in page that allows developers to add
passkey auth to their sites with just a few server-side HTTP handlers.


 DEBIAN'S GIT TRANSITION (15 MINUTE READ) [24] 

 Debian is actively transitioning its source code management from
`.dsc` source packages to a git-based workflow. 

 YOU DON'T NEED IT (7 MINUTE READ) [25] 

 Take a step back and evaluate the problems you are trying to solve
because you may find a better alternative.
