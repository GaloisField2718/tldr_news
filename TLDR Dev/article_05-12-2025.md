ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SVG FILTERS - CLICKJACKING 2.0 (32 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Clickjacking is a classic attack that involves covering up an iframe
of some other website in an attempt to trick the user into
unintentionally interacting with it. A new technique called SVG
clickjacking turns classic clickjacking on its head. It enables the
creation of complex interactive clickjacking attacks, as well as
multiple forms of data exfiltration. This article takes a look at the
technique and its various applications. 

 TEACHING AN LLM A NICHE DIAGRAMING LANGUAGE (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A 7B language model (Qwen2.5-Coder-7B) was successfully trained (with
86% accuracy) to generate and edit diagrams using the less popular
Pintora language. The training involved continued pretraining on
Pintora diagrams, followed by instruction fine-tuning. Data was
generated by an AI agent, cleaned, and used to train the model with
limited resources on Google Colab and Runpod.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY I IGNORE THE SPOTLIGHT AS A STAFF ENGINEER (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A Senior Staff Engineer at Google compares his own career path with
the spotlight-driven approach often emphasized in Big Tech, especially
in product-focused teams. His own focus is on developer tools and
infrastructure, with an emphasis on long-term stewardship and deep
technical ownership over chasing executive visibility. Staying with a
system long-term provided compounding returns through pattern
matching, allowing for impactful projects overall. 

 THOUGHTS ON GO VS. RUST VS. ZIG (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Go prioritizes minimalism and corporate collaboration. Rust
emphasizes safety and performance through complex features and strict
compile-time checks. Zig has manual memory management and encourages
data-oriented design.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MOST ITSM LEADERS WORRY ABOUT AI SECURITY — BUT THEY'RE ALREADY
EXPLORING AI FOR INCIDENT MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Here's what over 500 software developers, IT professionals, and IT
decision makers have to say about incident management [11]: While 74%
of respondents said security risks are their top barrier to expanding
AI use, 79% are already exploring AI for incident trending. See why in
Atlassian's 2025 State of Incident Management study [11] 

 DJANGO 6.0 RELEASE NOTES (20 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Django 6.0 features Content Security Policy support, template
partials, background tasks, and more. Email handling in Django now
uses Python's modern email API. There are some backward-incompatible
changes. This post looks at all of the changes in detail. 

 TUNNL.GG (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Tunnl.gg provides instant public URLs for local web servers, making
it easy to expose localhost to the internet. It requires no
installation as it relies solely on a simple SSH command. 

 WALRUS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Walrus is a high-performance, Rust-based distributed message
streaming engine. It uses segment-based sharding with Raft consensus
to guarantee fault tolerance and automatic load balancing. Walrus has
a simple TCP client protocol for managing topics and interacting with
message production and consumption.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STACKING DEPENDENCIES (26 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Inspired by the XKCD comic about software dependency towers, this dev
created a tool to visualize dependency graphs as physical towers. He
encountered an NP-hard problem that required him to explore graph
theory and various algorithms, ultimately combining a barycentric
heuristic with PQ-tree pruning for fast layout generation. The
resulting tool normalizes the dependency graph and then renders it as
stackable towers with information about maintainers. 

 BUILDING DEEP RESEARCH: HOW WE ACHIEVED STATE OF THE ART (8 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Tavily rebuilt its research agent from scratch after overengineering
the first version with assumptions that broke when new models arrived.
Instead of passing all tool outputs through the agent loop like most
systems do, it distilled outputs into compact reflections and only
loaded raw sources for final generation. This cut token usage by 66%
while hitting SOTA on benchmarks.

QUICK LINKS

 RAM IS SO EXPENSIVE, SAMSUNG WON'T EVEN SELL IT TO SAMSUNG (3 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Due to soaring RAM prices driven by AI demand, Samsung Semiconductor
reportedly rejected a supply order from Samsung Electronics for its
Galaxy phones, forcing them to renegotiate at higher, shorter-term
rates. 

 THE RAM SHORTAGE COMES FOR US ALL (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Due to the surging demand for RAM in AI data centers, memory prices
are skyrocketing, impacting PC builders, single-board computer
manufacturers, and eventually all consumer electronics. 

 IT'S HARDER TO READ CODE THAN TO WRITE IT (ESPECIALLY WHEN AI WRITES
IT) (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 While AI can generate code quickly, the increased volume and
complexity make reviewing and understanding that code more difficult
and necessary for maintaining quality. 

 VANILLA CSS IS ALL YOU NEED (11 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 37signals uses vanilla CSS without build tools in its applications by
using modern CSS features like custom properties, nesting, and the
:has() selector, resulting in simpler, more maintainable code. 

 HUNTING A PRODUCTION-ONLY PROXY BUG IN SVELTEKIT (16 MINUTE READ)
[21] 

 A step-by-step analysis that shows how a developer identified an
issue and resolved it. 

 NEXT AI DRAW.IO (GITHUB REPO) [22] 

 This is a Next.js web application that uses AI to create and modify
draw.io diagrams through natural language.
