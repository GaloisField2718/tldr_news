 👋 GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before
shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there)
is hard and pricey for any team.

QA Wolf's [5] AI-native solution provides high-volume, high-speed test
coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA
cycle to minutes. 

They can get you:

 	* 80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks [6]—not years
 	* Unlimited parallel test runs [7]
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No
more bugs reaching production.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of engineers [8] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW HIGHTOUCH BUILT THEIR LONG-RUNNING AGENT HARNESS (15 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Hightouch developed an AI marketing agent capable of complex,
multi-step tasks. Its team explicitly separated the model's planning
from its execution, allowing for dynamic plan updates as the agent
learns from data. To manage context, they used "agentic delegation"
through techniques like buffering large data to a temporary filesystem
and spawning dynamic subagents for isolated, complex sub-tasks. 

 UNCONVENTIONAL POSTGRESQL OPTIMIZATIONS (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article goes over some unconventional PostgreSQL optimization
techniques that go beyond standard practices like simple indexing. One
method involves enabling `constraint_exclusion` to remove unnecessary
full table scans when queries contradict existing check constraints.
Another technique optimizes for lower cardinality by creating
function-based indexes (e.g., on just the date part of a timestamp),
which are made consistently usable and efficient with virtual
generated columns. 

🧠 

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I'M ADDICTED TO BEING USEFUL (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A staff software engineer deeply loves his job despite current
industry stresses because of his addiction to being useful. He gets
satisfaction in work that aligns with his compulsion to solve
problems. His role is perfectly tailored to this, as he feels an
almost physical discomfort until he resolves a technical challenge. 

 AI'S MISSING INGREDIENT (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The current reliance on basic chatbot interfaces underutilizes AI's
potential. This failure of imagination comes from the absence of
design. AI needs more design expertise to create better products.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ANNOUNCING MASTRA 1.0! (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Mastra, an AI agent framework for TypeScript, has officially
announced the stable release of version 1.0. This version includes
Server Adapters for easier deployment, Composite Storage for flexible
backend configurations, and full support for Vercel's AI SDK v6. 

 PIPENET (WEBSITE) [14] 

 Pipenet is a modern, open-source alternative to localtunnel that
provides a bundled client and server to host your own secure tunnel
infrastructure. It allows users to expose local services to the
internet, share local development servers, test webhooks, or embed
tunneling capabilities directly into their own applications. 

 WXPATH (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 wxpath is a Python library for declarative web crawling and data
extraction, where traversal and extraction logic are expressed
directly using XPath. It introduces custom XPath operators like
`url(...)` and `///url(...)` to enable deep, breadth-first web graph
exploration within a single expression. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 WITHOUT BENCHMARKING LLMS, YOU'RE LIKELY OVERPAYING 5-10X (9 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Many users overpay for LLM API calls because common benchmarks don't
accurately predict performance or cost-effectiveness for their
specific tasks, leading them to default to popular but expensive
models. This article goes over a benchmarking methodology that
involves collecting real prompts, defining expected outputs, running
numerous LLMs via a unified API, and using an LLM-as-judge to score
responses based on quality, cost, and latency. This process
consistently revealed that many users can achieve comparable quality
at much lower costs, often cutting bills by 80% or more. 

 AI AGENTS AT WORK: REAL-TIME PLATFORM INSIGHTS IN SLACK (8 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Monday.com developed an AI Slack bot to help devs quickly access
real-time platform insights without having to manually check internal
tools or dig through notifications. The bot uses LLM agents connected
to their microservices data through an MCP. To prevent the AI from
hallucinating data, they pre-computed statistics rather than letting
the model calculate them. 

 RUNNING CLAUDE CODE DANGEROUSLY (SAFELY) (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The author wanted to use Claude Code with the
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag for an improved workflow, but
needed a safe, isolated environment to prevent accidental damage to
their host system. They initially considered Docker, but issues like
Docker-in-Docker requiring privileged mode made it unsuitable for true
sandboxing. They chose Vagrant to create a disposable virtual machine,
which offers full isolation and a reproducible configuration.

QUICK LINKS

 CLAUDE CHILL (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Claude Chill is a PTY proxy that tames Claude Code's massive terminal
updates by rendering only screen differences, preserving history, and
enabling lookback to prevent lag, flicker, and broken scrollback. 

 WHY AI CODING TOOLS SHIFT THE REAL BOTTLENECK TO REVIEW (8 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 Through testing identical features built manually versus with AI,
this developer found that AI generates 2-6× more code with extensive
defensive patterns and edge-case handling, changing review questions
from "what's missing?" to "is all this complexity necessary?" 

 THE CHALLENGES OF SOFT DELETE (10 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 The common `archived_at` column for soft delete has too many
complexities, and instead, alternatives like database triggers should
be considered. 

 THE AGENT SKILLS DIRECTORY (WEBSITE) [22] 

 Skills are reusable, plugin-like capabilities that provide procedural
knowledge to help AI agents more effectively accomplish specific
tasks, and this website is a directory of the most useful skills.
