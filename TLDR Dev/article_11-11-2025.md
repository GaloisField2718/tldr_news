 📒 FREE GUIDE: DISTRIBUTED SQL FOR AI-READY, CLOUD-NATIVE APPS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 When traffic spikes, your database shouldn't be the reason your apps
slow down, or worse, go offline. Traditional, monolithic databases
weren't built for today's cloud-native, GenAI, and RAG workflows.

In this free 2nd Special Edition Distributed SQL Databases For Dummies
[4] guide from Yugabyte, you'll get a detailed introduction to
Distributed SQL and learn how it helps you build modern applications
by:

 	* Ensuring continuous availability, even during cloud outages
 	* Scaling horizontally across regions and clouds
 	* Supporting AI-ready apps with strong transactional consistency

 SLASHING CI WAIT TIMES: HOW PINTEREST CUT ANDROID TESTING BUILD TIMES
BY 36%+ (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pinterest reduced Android testing build times by over 36% by
implementing a runtime-aware sharding mechanism. This in-house system,
called PinTestLab, uses historical test duration and stability data
from Pinterest's test management system, Metro, to distribute tests
across shards running on EC2-hosted emulators. The algorithm assigns
tests to emulators projected to finish earliest by prioritizing equal
wall-time over equal test counts. 

 DEPENDENT TYPES AND HOW TO GET RID OF THEM (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Dependent types are a programming language feature where types can
depend on values, and the concept can be broken down into three ideas:
functions returning types, input values determining output types, and
tuple values influencing the types of other tuple elements. To
optimize, compilers can erase values that are never used at runtime.
Dependently typed languages often automatically identify and erase
unused parameters. 

 MEMORY SAFETY FOR SKEPTICS (26 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Memory safety is still important to understand, even with languages
like Rust that are memory-safe by default. This means targeting
practical strategies, like prioritizing memory safety in new code,
targeting rewrites for critical components, and wrapping unsafe code
with safe interfaces. While governments aren't banning C or C++,
having better memory safety improves software performance and costs
overall.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 I HATE SCREENSHOTS OF TEXT (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Receiving screenshots of text from colleagues instead of copy-pasted
text, code files, or error logs makes debugging harder for everyone
involved. Screenshots lack context, make it difficult to search for
information, and are often less helpful than sharing the raw text. 

 FROM DEMOS TO DURABILITY (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI app builders are great at creating quick prototypes, but often
sacrifice code quality and long-term maintainability for speed. To
build lasting software, devs must prioritize good architecture, code
clarity, and best practices. 

 TIME TO START DE-APPLING (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 If you want to “de-Apple” your life due to Apple withdrawing
Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the UK, you can move data from
affected iCloud categories to secure, end-to-end encrypted services.
The government sought access to all iCloud data, not just that
protected by ADP, raising broader privacy concerns.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LESSONS LEARNED FROM OVER A MILLION LINES OF TYPESCRIPT AT PALANTIR
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Most teams get testing wrong - and it kills velocity. After a decade
leading Palantir's main frontend teams, Meticulous' [12] founder
shares 3 lessons every engineer should know about effective testing:
minimize maintenance costs, avoid fragile boundaries, and build
scalable integration tests. If you ship frontend code, this breakdown
is essential reading. [11] 

 THE (LAZY) GIT UI YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU NEED (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Lazygit is a terminal UI for Git. It improves productivity by making
Git commands more accessible, safer, and faster. 

 HOW TO CREATE ACCESSIBLE PDFS FROM THE START (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Creating accessible PDFs is hard. Typst is a markup-based writing
platform that automatically creates accessible PDFs by using semantic
elements and built-in validation. It makes sure documents are screen
reader-friendly by incorporating elements like headings, figures, and
tables with proper tagging.

 FROM WORDS TO WORLDS: SPATIAL INTELLIGENCE IS AI'S NEXT FRONTIER (23
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI's next frontier is spatial intelligence, moving beyond language
models to understand and interact with real and virtual worlds.
Spatial intelligence involves reasoning, planning, and interaction
with the physical environment, enabling imagination, creativity, and
scientific breakthroughs. Achieving this requires developing world
models with generative, multimodal, and interactive capabilities. 

 HIRING A DEVELOPER AS A SMALL INDIE STUDIO (IN 2025) (6 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 The indie game studio Ballard Games recently hired a software
developer after receiving 159 applications for the position. Faced
with limited resources, the studio streamlined its hiring process by
quickly filtering applicants based on salary expectations and relevant
skills. It used a practical take-home assignment, directly related to
the role, to assess coding abilities in a realistic scenario.

QUICK LINKS

 LLMS ARE STEROIDS FOR YOUR DUNNING-KRUGER (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The impact of LLMs as "confidence engines" can amplify both good
ideas and self-delusion by providing a sense of wrong certainty. 

 USING THE EXPAND AND CONTRACT PATTERN FOR SCHEMA CHANGES (14 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 The expand and contract pattern is a multi-step process that allows
for safe and reliable database schema migrations without downtime by
introducing new structures in parallel, migrating data, and then
transitioning clients incrementally to the new schema while providing
rollback options. 

 ON ZIG (AND THE DESIGN CHOICES WITHIN) (13 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Zig, while interesting, falls short due to its lack of memory safety,
overly complex comptime features, and various practical and tooling
shortcomings. 

 THE LINUX KERNEL LOOKS TO "BITE THE BULLET" IN ENABLING MICROSOFT C
EXTENSIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The Linux kernel is likely to enable Microsoft C Extensions in the
upcoming 6.19 release, allowing for potentially cleaner code by using
non-standard C/C++ constructs.
