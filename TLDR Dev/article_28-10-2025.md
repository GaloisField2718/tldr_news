 BUILD REAL-TIME TALKING AVATARS WITH DECART (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Give your avatar a voice, using Real-Time Lip Sync API powered by
Decart.

Stream audio in → get perfectly synced video + speech out.

Fully open-source [5], in collaboration with ElevenLabs.

Your avatar talks, pauses, and reacts in real time, just like a person
on the other side of the screen.

Use any voice engine. Bring your own character. Plug it into your
stack.

Build multimodal agents, virtual humans, or real-time AI interfaces -
all from one pipeline.

GET LIPSYNC LIVE API [4].

CONGRATS, YOUR CODE HAS OPINIONS NOW.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WHEN 'PERFECT' CODE FAILS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A critical security bug found in this dev's Next.js application was
caused by a seemingly perfect one-line equality check. Due to
Next.js's server function implementation, the synchronous function was
unexpectedly converted to an asynchronous function returning a
Promise. In JavaScript, a Promise evaluates to true in an `if`
statement, effectively bypassing the security check and granting
access to everyone. 

 IMPORTING VS FETCHING JSON (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Using fetch() over the newly available JSON module imports in
browsers is preferred as it has better error handling with
response.status and the ability to access source text even when JSON
parsing fails. The main concern with imported modules is that they are
cached for the page's lifetime, creating memory leaks when importing
dynamic data like search results, while fetch() allows garbage
collection of unused data.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE NEW CALCULUS OF AI-BASED CODING (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This team used AI agents to write code, resulting in a 10x increase
in coding throughput. This agentic coding requires a shift in
traditional software development practices, especially in testing,
deployment, and team coordination, to avoid increased bugs and
bottlenecks. AI agents can also be used to reduce the costs of
implementing testing approaches and improving the infrastructure
needed to sustain high velocity. 

 AI CAN CODE, BUT IT CAN'T BUILD SOFTWARE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An increase in requests for technical cofounders suggests a gap in
what AI can currently accomplish. While AI is great at coding
specific, isolated tasks, it struggles with the complexities of
building and maintaining production-ready software. Software
engineering is different from mere coding, as it involves integration,
expansion, and long-term maintainability, which AI currently doesn't
have.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AI NATIVE DEVCON: MANAGING AGENT FLEETS, SPEC-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT GOES
MULTIPLAYER, AND MORE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 On November 18-19, 2025, Tessl's AI Native DevCon is coming to
Brooklyn, NYC! Speakers from Snyk, Thoughtworks, Netlify, and AWS will
cover what's possible today - as well as what's still emerging: MCP
security, open source tool, high-voltage developer workflows, and
more. GET 50% OFF WITH CODE TLDR [10] or watch the action online
(free) [10]. 

 GPUI COMPONENT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 GPUI Component is a Rust library that offers a set of over 60
cross-platform UI components for building desktop applications with a
modern design inspired by macOS, Windows, and shadcn/ui. It provides
features like customizable themes, flexible layouts, high-performance
virtualized lists and tables, a code editor with syntax highlighting
and LSP support, and native Markdown and HTML rendering. 

 JSON QUERY (WEBSITE) [12] 

 JSON Query is a small, flexible language for querying JSON data that
allows filtering, sorting, and picking properties. 

 USING MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (MCP) WITH EXPO (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Expo MCP Server connects AI coding agents to your Expo projects
so they can access docs, automate workflows, and verify your app
visually. It integrates with tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and VS
Code, teaching them about the Expo SDK and enabling interaction with
mobile simulators and React Native DevTools. Some local capabilities
include taking screenshots, opening DevTools, and automation features
like tapping views and finding elements.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STATE OF GENERATIVE MEDIA SURVEY REPORT 2025 (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A survey found that image generation has stronger personal adoption,
with Google's Gemini leading in image model adoption and Veo leading
in video. Organizations are seeing fast ROI, with 65% reporting
returns within 12 months, and are making changes to their processes
and budgets to integrate media generation models. Quality is the top
factor for model selection, but cost is important for video generation
APIs. 

 AMAZON REPORTEDLY HOPES TO REPLACE 600,000 US WORKERS WITH ROBOTS (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 According to leaked documents, Amazon plans to replace 600,000 US
workers with robots by 2033 to automate 75% of their operations,
potentially saving 30 cents per item by 2027. Amazon considered using
different terminology to downplay potential job losses and improve its
public image. Amazon disputes the documents, stating that they don't
reflect the company's overall hiring strategy.

QUICK LINKS

 CLAUDE FOR EXCEL (WEBSITE) [16] 

 Anthropic is offering a beta research preview of Claude for Excel, a
tool that understands complex workbooks to provide explanations and
update assumptions while preserving formulas. 

 EASY RISC-V (WEBSITE) [17] 

 Easy RISC-V is an interactive tutorial introducing RISC-V assembly
programming that covers instruction syntax, computational
instructions, jumps and branches, memory access, functions, privilege
levels, exception handling, and a bare-bones operating system. 

 AVOID 2:00 AND 3:00 AM CRON JOBS! (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Avoid scheduling cron jobs at 2:00 or 3:00 am, especially on Sundays,
to prevent issues caused by daylight saving time changes, or better
yet, use the UTC timezone. 

 SIMPLIFY YOUR CODE: FUNCTIONAL CORE, IMPERATIVE SHELL (2 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Structuring code with a "functional core, imperative shell" pattern
separates pure business logic from side effects (like database calls
and email sending) to improve testability, maintainability, and
adaptability.
