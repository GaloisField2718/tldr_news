 CLERK MCP SERVER (PUBLIC BETA) (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The Clerk MCP server gives AI coding assistants direct access to
current docs, patterns, and best practices. Prompt naturally, get
accurate implementations.

Build prompts like:

	* "Set up a B2B SaaS with organizations and role-based permissions"
	* "Add Clerk middleware to my API"
	* "Build a waitlist with user metadata"

Try it today [4] and share your feedback.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SCALING POSTGRESQL TO POWER 800 MILLION CHATGPT USERS (14 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 OpenAI scaled PostgreSQL to support 800 million ChatGPT users and
millions of queries per second for its predominantly read-heavy
workloads. To achieve this, its team offloaded write-heavy operations
to sharded systems like Azure Cosmos DB and implemented application
and query optimizations. Their architecture uses a single primary
Azure PostgreSQL instance and nearly 50 global read replicas. 

 WHAT IS A DESIGN ENGINEER? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A design engineer bridges the gap between design and frontend
development, creating software that not only works perfectly but also
feels great to use. They directly implement designs in code, build and
maintain design systems, and add in the critical final details of UI
polish, like micro-interactions and animations. 

 WHY DOES SSH SEND 100 PACKETS PER KEYSTROKE? (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A developer building a high-performance SSH game found that a single
keystroke generated over 100 small packets. The root cause was
identified as OpenSSH's keystroke timing obfuscation feature, which
sends "chaff" packets to disguise typing patterns. By patching Go's
SSH library to disable the `ping@openssh.com` extension server-side,
the developer achieved a dramatic >50% reduction in CPU and bandwidth.
LLMs assisted in the debugging process.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOUR APP SUBSCRIPTION IS NOW MY WEEKEND PROJECT (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This dev replaced his subscription apps, like Wispr Flow and Loom, by
vibecoding his own personal alternatives. Despite having no prior
macOS development experience, he quickly created custom applications
that perfectly suited his specific needs for free. However, these apps
are not production-ready, but rather perfect for personal projects. 

 MY FIRST YEAR IN SALES AS A TECHNICAL FOUNDER (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A technical founder had a challenging but rewarding first year in
sales. High-touch sales are vital for bootstrapped SaaS growth. Their
best channel was their LinkedIn B2B sales funnel, with disciplined
discovery calls.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REMOTION AGENT SKILLS (WEBSITE) [10] 

 Remotion Agent Skills allow videos to be made programmatically with
coding agents like Claude Code. 

 TOWNIE'S BACK IN TOWN! (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Townie v5 is an AI agent powered by Claude 4.5 designed to integrate
directly into the browser alongside the code editor. The agent can
perform nearly any action a user can, including managing code, files,
versions, and databases, allowing for the rapid scaffolding of
features or full-stack applications.

MISCELLANEOUS

 KEEPING 20,000 GPUS HEALTHY (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Modal runs a globally distributed pool of over 20,000 GPUs across
multiple cloud providers. Its approach begins with instance type
testing and selection, evaluating performance and reliability
differences between cloud hyperscalers. This is followed by machine
image preparation and automated boot checks to guarantee GPU health
before customer workloads begin. Throughout an instance's life, Modal
performs continuous passive and active healthchecking. 

 THE CONTEXT COLLAPSE PROBLEM (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI coding assistants deliver productivity gains on new projects but
underperform on legacy codebases, a "context collapse problem" caused
by the invisibility of institutional knowledge and historical
decisions. Good solutions include treating documentation as
infrastructure, incrementally restructuring code for AI legibility,
and initially using senior engineers as "human context bridges.”

QUICK LINKS

 THE BEST CODE IS NO CODE: COMPOSING APIS AND CLIS IN THE ERA OF LLMS
(8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 LLMs should use composable shell commands and CLI tools, interpreting
existing API standards or reverse-engineering them, to interact with
services. 

 I WAS BANNED FROM CLAUDE FOR SCAFFOLDING A CLAUDE.MD FILE (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 A Claude power user was banned without warning or explanation after
using two Claude instances in a loop to scaffold a `CLAUDE.md` file
containing system-like instructions, an activity they suspect
triggered prompt injection detection. 

 CSS OPTICAL ILLUSIONS (16 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This is a collection of over 50 optical illusions and interactive
demos coded with CSS and HTML. 

 SSH HAS NO HOST HEADER (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 To route SSH connections to multiple VMs sharing IPv4 addresses,
exe.dev assigns each VM a unique IP from a pool relative to its owner,
then identifies the target VM using the incoming IP address and the
user's public key, as SSH doesn't have a Host header equivalent.
