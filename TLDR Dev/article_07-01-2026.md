ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING A TOAST COMPONENT (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sonner was a library released in 2023 that quickly became the default
toast component for shadcn/ui, despite a crowded market. Its success
was due to its well-implemented stacking animations achieved with
interruptible CSS transitions, and intuitive functionalities like
momentum-based swipe-to-dismiss and expandable toast displays. The
developer experience was also unique, with interactive documentation,
a simple, hook-free API using the Observer Pattern, and a promise API
for managing toast states. 

 REPRESENTING HIERARCHIES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There are two common methods for representing hierarchical data
structures, like HTML elements or file systems. The "obvious way" uses
an array of pointers to child nodes, which allows for convenient
indexed access but introduces dynamic memory allocations and potential
cache misses. The "allocation-free way" uses first-child and
next-sibling pointers, removing the need for dynamic memory management
for child relationships and improving cache efficiency.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AI MAKES EXPLORATION CHEAP, NOT DECISIONS EASY (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI doesn't make decisions for you, but it makes exploring ideas much
cheaper. While AI can generate options, prototypes, and directions
much faster now, the hard part is still using judgment to pick what
actually works well, both engineering-wise and product-wise. 

 VIBE CODING WITHOUT SYSTEM DESIGN IS A TRAP (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI tools primarily optimize for immediate functionality rather than
proper, evolvable system design. This often results in "accidental
architecture," which has hardcoded values, little-to-no testing, and a
wide range of edge cases, making products fragile and expensive to
maintain or change over time. To counteract this, devs must apply
systems thinking and product management discipline before using AI by
consciously designing for future changes and dependencies. 

 WHY DEVS NEED DEVOPS (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The software engineering industry is at risk of knowledge
deterioration, where the foundational thinking behind successful
practices like DevOps is lost. The core of DevOps includes optimizing
the entire flow of value, establishing short feedback loops to
identify issues early, and ensuring continuous learning across the
team. Internalizing these principles grants developers predictive
power.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MANTIC (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Mantic is a structural code search engine for AI agents. It provides
sub-500ms file ranking across massive codebases without relying on
embeddings or external dependencies. Mantic infers intent from file
structure and metadata, reducing token usage and running entirely
locally. 

 PI CODING AGENT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 The Pi Coding Agent is a terminal-based coding agent for headless
coding tasks that runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows and supports
multiple model providers with mid-session model switching. It has
slash-command workflows, session saving + branching, context
compaction, bash/tool execution, and customization via settings. It
also has SDK/RPC modes for programmatic use.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DOOM CODING (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This is a guide on how to code on a smartphone from anywhere by
remotely accessing a home computer. The method relies on a 24/7
running computer, Tailscale for secure networking, Termius as a mobile
terminal, and Claude Code for AI assistance. The setup involves
enabling SSH, installing Tailscale and Claude Code on the computer,
then installing Tailscale and Termius on the phone to connect via the
computer's MagicDNS. 

 A FIELD GUIDE TO SANDBOXES FOR AI (36 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI agents often need to execute untrusted code, so they use
sandboxes. Effective sandboxing requires consideration of three
distinct aspects: the isolation boundary, access policy, and execution
lifecycle. There are various types of sandboxes, like containers
(sharing the host kernel, insufficient for hostile code), gVisor
(userspace kernel interposition), microVMs (guest kernel via hardware
virtualization), and runtime sandboxes (no direct syscall access). 

 HACKING DLOPEN TO STATICALLY LINK PIPEWIRE (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tuple is a pair programming app that wanted to create a fully static
Linux executable, but had a big challenge with PipeWire, which it uses
for screen capture. PipeWire's core functionality relies on `dlopen`
for internal plugin systems (modules and Spa plugins), making
traditional static linking impossible. It solved this by developing a
"fake dynamic linker" using Zig, which reimplements `dlopen`, `dlsym`,
and `stat` to statically link PipeWire's plugins into an internal
symbol table.

QUICK LINKS

 SOFTWARE TOO CHEAP TO METER (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Thanks to AI coding agents, software creation is becoming so easy and
affordable that personalized, bespoke applications will increasingly
replace one-size-fits-all solutions. 

 WHY MOST WEBSITES DON'T NEED COOKIE CONSENT BANNERS (7 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Most websites unnecessarily display cookie consent banners due to
their overreliance on invasive third-party tracking tools. 

 PRISM.TOOLS (WEBSITE) [17] 

 A suite of free, online dev tools or tasks like formatting, security,
design, content generation, and data transformation. 

 CODE IS A LIABILITY (NOT AN ASSET) (22 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Code, especially when generated by AI, is a liability rather than an
asset, as code requires maintainability to last long-term.
