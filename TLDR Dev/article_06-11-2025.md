 30,000 BUGS IN 30 DAYS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Sentry launched AI Code Review 30 days ago. Since then, it's caught
30k bugs and is working 50% faster [4]. Read the blog post [4] to
learn:

 	* How Sentry applies a “thinking budget” to each review step to
prevent overthinking - making AI code reviews are leaner and
speedier. 
 	* The new Claude Skill that connects Claude Code directly to AI Code
Review outputs.
 	* Revamping how AI comments are structured

➡️ The bottom line: AI Code Review has caught 30K+ bugs.. .and
it's only going to get better.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 NOT SO "MINI"-DUMPS: HOW WE FOUND MISSING CRASHES ON STEAMOS (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sentry improved its game engine SDKs to capture crash reports from
Windows games running on Linux via Wine/Proton, addressing a problem
where crash reports were missing from Steam Deck. The issue came from
Wine's Thread Environment Block (TEB) implementation, which caused
Crashpad to capture excessively large stack regions in minidumps
exceeding Sentry's size limit. Sentry's solution involved switching
Crashpad to use the stack pointer (SP) instead of the TEB for stack
capture, which accurately reflects used memory. 

 SUPERCHARGING THE ML AND AI DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE AT NETFLIX WITH
METAFLOW (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Netflix's Spin is a new Metaflow functionality that accelerates ML/AI
development by enabling notebook-like iteration within
production-ready workflows. Spin treats each `@step` as a checkpoint
boundary that automatically persists state, allowing developers to
resume execution from any point and iterate quickly without losing
continuity. 

 HOW TO MANAGE CONTEXT IN AI CODING WORKFLOWS (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Successful AI coding requires context engineering over prompt
engineering, which means building systems that reliably provide AI
with the right information automatically. The key is co-locating
mandatory context (like `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, or system design
docs) directly in your repository while centralizing access to
distributed info through a single tool.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHY STARTUPS CHOOSE REACT (AND WHEN YOU SHOULDN'T) (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 React dominates startup funding, capturing 88.6% of the $2.85 billion
raised by software startups in 2025, despite the availability of
alternative frameworks like Vue, Angular, and Svelte. While React's
massive ecosystem provides significant advantages, with over 1 million
active projects compared to competitors' 100K-128K, approximately 85%
of projects across all framework ecosystems end up abandoned on
GitHub. Interestingly, smaller frameworks like Svelte show better
project survival rates (36.1% vs React's 20.7% for quality projects). 

 WHY YOUR BEST ENGINEERS ARE INTERVIEWING ELSEWHERE (23 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 High engineering turnover stems from executives being out of touch
with on-the-ground realities due to hierarchical information
filtering. This filtering prevents executives from addressing engineer
concerns like overruled technical judgments, accumulating technical
debt, and meaningless work, leading to disengagement and costly
replacements. To combat this, it's best to have regular skip-level
conversations between executives and engineers to bypass filtering and
act on engineer feedback, which is cheaper than the costs associated
with high turnover. 

 THE LEARNING LOOP AND LLMS (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Software development is fundamentally a learning process that cannot
be automated away, even with advanced LLMs. While LLMs can be helpful
for brainstorming and reducing initial setup friction, they cannot
replace the essential learning loop of observing, experimenting, and
applying knowledge that developers must go through to build real
expertise. True learning requires hands-on experience with failures
and discoveries that AI cannot provide.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SHIP DOMAIN INTEGRATIONS IN HOURS WITH THE NAME.COM API (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 Use the same API that powers Vercel, Replit, and Netlify's domain
name services. Built for AI agents and human developers with OpenAPI
spec and MCP support—integrate domain search, registration, and
management without the engineering overhead. START BUILDING [11] 

 REACT NATIVE GODOT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 React Native Godot allows embedding the Godot game engine into React
Native applications on both Android and iOS, running the engine on a
separate thread for optimal performance. It provides full access to
the Godot API from TypeScript/JavaScript. The library supports
starting, stopping, pausing, and restarting the Godot Engine, even
allowing reconfiguration and different Godot app loading upon
restarting. 

 INTRODUCING UNIWIND - THE FASTEST TAILWIND BINDINGS FOR REACT NATIVE
(5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Uniwind introduces fast and stable Tailwind CSS bindings for React
Native apps. It provides a unified cross-platform styling solution,
improving on existing solutions like Nativewind with a custom CSS
parser and easy theming. Uniwind also includes automatic React Native
component bindings and supports collaborations. 

 DILLO (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Dillo is a multi-platform graphical web browser with a focus on
security and privacy. It's built with the FLTK 1.3 GUI toolkit. The
repository contains the original code with some minor patches.

 OCTOVERSE: A NEW DEVELOPER JOINS GITHUB EVERY SECOND AS AI LEADS
TYPESCRIPT TO #1 (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 GitHub experienced record growth in 2025, adding over 36 million new
developers (more than one per second on average) to reach 180+ million
total developers, largely driven by the release of GitHub Copilot Free
in late 2024. For the first time in over a decade, TypeScript overtook
both Python and JavaScript to become the most-used language on GitHub,
showing how AI-assisted development is influencing developers' tool
choices toward more reliable, typed languages. 

 LEARNING FROM FAILURE TO TACKLE EXTREMELY HARD PROBLEMS (10 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning) is a novel algorithm
designed to improve machine learning in scenarios where positive
rewards are extremely rare and reward evaluation is costly. It works
by learning a generative model of failures, allowing it to avoid
repeating past mistakes and effectively explore the solution space
using only negative reward samples. Experiments on adversarial attacks
and language model reasoning show BaNEL's ability to improve success
rates compared to existing methods, especially when additional
computation is available.

QUICK LINKS

 FACEBOOK.COM HAS 140 LAYERS OF CONTEXT PROVIDERS (REDDIT THREAD) [17]


 A React developer discovered that Facebook.com uses 140 layers of
React Context Providers, surpassing other popular social media
platforms (TikTok uses 24) and potentially complicating debugging due
to the depth of the component tree. 

 THE AI ICK (15 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 There is discomfort and devaluation associated with AI-generated
content, especially in art and marketing, partly due to the societal
implications of AI's encroachment on human creativity. 

 PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS SIMPLE SLO (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A new employee is assigned a seemingly simple SLO implementation task
for the "Foo" service, which quickly spirals into a complex and
frustrating endeavor involving miscalculations, unexpected technical
challenges, shifting requirements, and ultimately leads to his
termination despite his attempts to meet the ever-changing and often
contradictory demands of his manager. 

 ABSURD WORKFLOWS: DURABLE EXECUTION WITH JUST POSTGRES (6 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 Absurd is a lightweight SQL-only library that uses Postgres for
durable execution and workflow management, making it easier to build
AI agents with long-running tasks and event-driven architectures.
