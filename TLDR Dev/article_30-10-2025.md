 THE NEW PLAYBOOK FOR AI-POWERED TEAMWORK (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Today's engineering teams face mounting pressure: fragmented tools,
context switching, and information silos are eroding productivity and
creativity.

Join Atlassian leaders for a deep dive webinar [4] into how AI-powered
teamwork reduces operational overhead, unlocks productivity gains, and
keeps you focused on innovation and delivery. During the event, you
can expect to:

📑 Dive into findings from Atlassian's latest research [4] on
developer productivity.

🤖 Learn how AI-driven workflows and centralized knowledge empower
teams to reclaim time and reduce context switching.

🌎 Gain actionable strategies from real-world examples.

Save your seat. [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 KAFKA IS FAST -- I'LL USE POSTGRES (34 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Developers often prematurely adopt complex technologies like Kafka
when Postgres would suffice. Benchmarks show Postgres' impressive
scalability for both pub/sub messaging and queueing, often meeting the
needs of most organizations. Despite concerns about scaling, the
article shows Postgres' scalability and suggests that many projects
have ample time to migrate if necessary. 

 I BUILT THE SAME APP 10 TIMES: EVALUATING FRAMEWORKS FOR MOBILE
PERFORMANCE (45 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A developer built the same Kanban app 10 times to evaluate mobile
performance, finding that next-gen frameworks (Marko, SolidStart, and
SvelteKit) delivered 35-39ms load times with bundles 4-6x smaller than
Next.js, which shipped 176.3 kB compressed and loaded in 467ms. It was
found that React has an unavoidable performance ceiling, since
TanStack Start with React delivered 118.2 kB compressed versus 60.4 kB
with Solid using identical infrastructure, proving React's runtime
adds 2x overhead. 

 AWS TO BARE METAL TWO YEARS LATER: ANSWERING YOUR TOUGHEST QUESTIONS
ABOUT LEAVING AWS (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OneUptime migrated from AWS to bare-metal two years ago, and they are
now saving $1.2M/year. The migration involved running MicroK8s + Ceph
with high availability, improving latency, and reinvesting savings
into AI servers. They found bare metal cheaper than AWS after
factoring in all costs, including bandwidth and control plane fees,
and despite initial concerns, reliability improved.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 UV IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO THE PYTHON ECOSYSTEM IN A DECADE (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 uv, a new open-source Python package manager, makes Python
installation and dependency management much easier. uv can install
Python versions, manage virtual environments, and resolve dependency
conflicts faster and more efficiently than other tools. 

 WHY DEVELOPERS ARE LEAVING NEXT.JS FOR TANSTACK START, AND LOVING IT
(8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Developers are leaving Next.js for TanStack Start due to frustration
with Next.js's growing complexity, constant changes, and tight
coupling with Vercel's platform. TanStack Start feels more appealing
because it feels closer to vanilla React with less “magic,”
offering type-safe routing, integrated server functions, and flexible
deployment without vendor lock-in.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BUILDING DATABASES FOR THE CLOUD-NATIVE AND GENAI ERA (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Data-driven organizations require an agile, cloud-native database to
support modern cloud infrastructure and application architectures.
DISTRIBUTED SQL DATABASES FOR DUMMIES [11] provides a detailed
explanation of how to meet today's cloud-native, GenAI, and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application demands using a
distributed SQL database architecture. 👉 DOWNLOAD THE EBOOK [11] 

 COMPOSER: BUILDING A FAST FRONTIER MODEL WITH RL (5 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Cursor has developed Composer, a new agent model for software
engineering that achieves frontier coding results four times faster
than similar models. Composer is a mixture-of-experts model trained
with reinforcement learning to solve real-world software engineering
challenges using various tools, including code editing and semantic
search. 

 EMOJI REGEX (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Emoji-Regex provides a regular expression to match all emoji symbols
and sequences based on the Unicode Standard. It was built using
`emoji-test-regex-pattern` and can be easily updated with new Unicode
emoji releases, guaranteeing deterministic results.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A BRIEF HISTORY OF DOMAINS (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Paul Mockapetris invented DNS to map domain names to IP addresses,
creating a centralization point in the Internet. There was a domain
gold rush where early investors registered domains for free and later
sold them for millions (like sex.com for $12 million). This article
covers ICANN's 1998 creation to govern TLDs, how registries bid for
TLD rights in auctions (Google paid $25 million for .app), and
dramatic geopolitical domain stories, like one about Yugoslavia's .yu
domain, which was literally stolen when scientists cut network lines
with scissors during the country's breakup. 

 DISASTERS I'VE SEEN IN A MICROSERVICES WORLD, PART II (8 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Recurring disasters in microservice architectures are usually due to
four specific problems: having more services than engineers, poorly
designed gateway layers, unconstrained technology sprawl, and
architectures mirroring organizational charts rather than domains.
Distributed systems, including emerging AI agents, still suffer from
fundamental challenges like latency and observability. 

 IS LLAMA REALLY AS BAD AS PEOPLE SAY? I PUT META'S AI TO THE TEST (11
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Meta's Llama 3.2 1B model is a useful, lightweight coding assistant
for development work. It's not as bad as critics claim. However, it
can't handle agentic coding and produces functional but imperfect
code, constantly requiring manual fixes. Llama is best for simple
projects like todo apps.

 MICROSOFT SAYS IT'S RECOVERING AFTER AZURE OUTAGE TOOK DOWN 365,
XBOX, AND STARBUCKS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A Microsoft Azure outage, caused by an inadvertent configuration
change, disrupted numerous services, including Microsoft 365 and Xbox,
and impacted other companies like Starbucks and Alaska Airlines. 

 REMOVING OBFUSCATION IN JAVA EDITION (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Minecraft: Java Edition is removing code obfuscation to make modding

of Mayhem launch. 

 KEEP ANDROID OPEN (WEBSITE) [19] 

 Google's plan to require mandatory registration for Android app
developers, including fees, identification, and app information,

 TIPS FOR STROKE-SURVIVING SOFTWARE ENGINEERS (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Software engineers who have survived strokes should prioritize
self-care, workload management, and use legal protections and AI to
accommodate cognitive limitations.
