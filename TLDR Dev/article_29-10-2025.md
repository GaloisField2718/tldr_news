ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 FROM THUNDERING HERDS TO SMOOTH STREAMS: HOW PATREON SCALED FOR LIVE
EVENTS (27 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Patreon scaled its platform to support live events by addressing the
challenges of handling a surge of users. Its team focused on
understanding and quantifying load, creating a load test to measure
capacity, and then optimizing both infrastructure and client
performance. To improve infrastructure, they fine-tuned web requests
and reduced requests made at cold app launch for iOS. 

 AGENTIC AI AND SECURITY (24 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Agentic AI systems have a fundamental security flaw: LLMs cannot
separate instructions from data, making them vulnerable to prompt
injection attacks where untrusted content contains hidden commands.
The worst security occurs when an AI has access to sensitive data,
reads untrusted content, and can communicate externally, allowing
attackers to steal information by embedding instructions in sources
like Jira tickets or web pages. To prevent this, it's best to run LLMs
in sandboxed containers, avoid production credentials in files, limit
untrusted content sources, and split tasks to isolate risks. 

 THE “10X” COMMANDMENTS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE GO (10 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Best practices for writing great Go code include keeping main
functions minimal, using named constants instead of magic values,
preventing security holes with tools like os.Root, embedding static
data with go:embed for single binaries, and making sure goroutines
terminate properly using contexts and waitgroups. Code should work
first with a “walking skeleton,” and then can be refactored after.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HIGH AGENCY MATTERS (47 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Personal agency, the capacity to take initiative and act decisively,
is more necessary for success than raw intelligence. Intelligence can
lead to analysis paralysis and fear of failure, while agency drives
action, learning, and the creation of opportunities. In reality,
agency is rare due to societal conditioning and psychological factors,
but can be cultivated through a bias towards action and surrounding
oneself with proactive individuals. 

 INSIDE AMAZON'S ENGINEERING CULTURE: LESSONS FROM THEIR SENIOR
PRINCIPALS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Amazon's private open house for senior engineering leaders in Seattle
exposed three key themes defining Amazon's engineering culture:
mission-driven purpose, clear alignment between titles and roles, and
a focus on craft over perks. The event showed Amazon's commitment to
customer obsession and solving problems at scale, with reversible
decisions encouraged to move fast and one-way decisions approached
with careful consideration. 

 HOW MANAGERS BUILD (OR BREAK) THEIR TEAM'S SELF-CONFIDENCE (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Team underperformance often comes from lack of self-confidence rather
than lack of skill, and managers inadvertently destroy confidence
through micromanaging, public criticism, jumping in too quickly to
help, and inconsistent expectations. To build confidence, managers
should give autonomy with clear guardrails, criticize privately while
praising publicly, ask questions before solving problems, and provide
consistent encouragement and reassurance.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SENTRY'S AI CODE REVIEW PREDICTS WHAT'S GOING TO BREAK - BASED ON
WHAT'S ALREADY BROKEN (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Code reviews should be less style nits and more "this is going to
break prod". Sentry's AI Code Review blends context and issue
history with the code you just touched [10] - function calls, class or
objects dependencies, database connections - to provide specific and
actionable feedback rather than generic linting advice. Read the blog
[10] 

 DEXTO (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Dexto is a toolkit for building AI agents that can turn natural
language into actions by orchestrating LLMs, tools, and data. It has a
configuration-driven framework, runtime, and smooth developer
experience, supporting various interfaces like CLI, Web UI, and APIs.
Dexto helps the creation of autonomous agents, digital companions, and
multi-agent systems, with features like session management, multimodal
support, and production-ready observability. 

 BUTTER (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Butter is a cache that saves money by identifying and serving repeat
LLM responses, making AI systems deterministic. It's compatible with
Chat Completions APIs like OpenAI and integrates with tools like
LangChain and Crew AI. Butter is ideal for autonomous agents
performing repetitive tasks. It is priced at 5% of the savings it
generates, though currently free.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE NEXT CHAPTER OF THE MICROSOFT–OPENAI PARTNERSHIP (4 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Microsoft and OpenAI have announced a new agreement extending their
partnership. The deal involves Microsoft holding a large investment in
OpenAI Group PBC following recapitalization, along with refined IP
rights and continued exclusivity for Microsoft until Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI) is verified by an independent expert panel.
This new phase allows both companies to independently innovate, with
Microsoft extending its IP rights and pursuing AGI independently,
while OpenAI gains flexibility in developing products and providing
API access. 

 WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SIDELOADING (7 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Google's new developer verification policies basically end users'
freedom to choose their software sources. This policy requires
developers to register with Google, which goes against the open nature
of Android. 

 THE CONTINUAL LEARNING PROBLEM (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The challenge of continual learning in AI models is updating model
parameters without compromising existing knowledge. Memory layers, a
sparse attention mechanism, is a potential solution for continual
learning due to its targeted updates, high capacity, and adaptive
integration. A recent paper shows that finetuning memory layers leads
to much less forgetting compared to full finetuning or LoRA when
learning new information.

 AMAZON LAYS OFF THOUSANDS OF CORPORATE WORKERS AS IT SPENDS BIG ON AI
(3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Amazon has laid off about 14,000 corporate employees to reduce
bureaucracy and shift resources towards investments in artificial
intelligence following disappointing AI growth and pressure from
investors to tighten finances. 

 I'VE BEEN LOVING CLAUDE CODE ON THE WEB (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Claude Code on the web and its iOS app have a solid and dependable
implementation as a "to-do list that does itself.” 

 BORING IS WHAT WE WANTED (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The predictable, incremental improvements in Apple silicon Macs, now
at the M5 generation, are a positive outcome and a fulfillment of what
Mac users desired after years of inconsistent hardware updates during
the PowerPC and Intel eras. 

 RETHINKING ASYNC LOOPS IN JAVASCRIPT (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Using `await` in JavaScript loops requires careful implementation to
avoid performance issues and unexpected behavior - it's usually better
to use Promise.all or Promise.allSettled for reliability.
