 FRAMEWORK + SCORECARD: AI PROTOTYPING FOR PRODUCT LEADERS (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 According to Forrester, 88% of engineering, product, and design
leaders think prototyping needs to happen earlier. Wait til late in
the lifecycle to surface changes and you'll get months of delays.

🤔 But to find issues when you still have time to fix them, you need
tools that create editable prototypes, not fully fleshed bad ideas. 

In this Miro guide [4], product leaders get a:

1️⃣ Question set to define requirements & priorities

2️⃣ AI prototyping landscape overview

3️⃣ Tooling evaluation framework + scorecard [4] 

Tackle problems early in the lifecycle by accelerating your
prototyping strategy. Get the guide to learn how.  [4]

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE INTERNET IS COOL. THANK YOU, TCP (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TCP is a protocol that underpins much of the Internet. It controls
reliable data transmission despite underlying network instability. TCP
has mechanisms for flow and congestion control, which prevent
overwhelming receivers and the network itself, along with allowing it
to recover from packet loss, corruption, and reordering. This article
provides C code examples with a simple TCP server and a basic HTTP
server, showing how applications use TCP for reliable communication. 

 WHAT IF YOU DON'T NEED MCP AT ALL? (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 MCP servers for browser automation with agents are often inefficient
and hard to extend. Instead, simple Bash scripts and code for tasks
like starting a browser, navigating URLs, executing JavaScript, and
taking screenshots are usually more token efficient and more
customizable. By cloning tool repositories and setting up an alias,
these scripts become globally available to agents like Claude, making
browser interaction easier. 

 THE INNER WORKINGS OF JAVASCRIPT SOURCE MAPS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 JavaScript source maps translate minified production code locations
back to original source files, letting developers debug with proper
variable names and formatting. This happens through VLQ (Variable
Length Quantity) encoding with Base64 characters in the `mappings`
field, which compresses position data by storing small relative
differences between locations rather than absolute coordinates,
separated by commas (for columns) and semicolons (for line breaks).
Each mapping segment contains 1, 4, or 5 values that specify the
generated file column, source file index, source line/column, and
optionally the original identifier name, allowing tools to efficiently
bridge production code and developer-friendly sources.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ANTHROPIC'S PAPER SMELLS LIKE BULLSHIT (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Anthropic's recent report on a Chinese cyber espionage operation
coordinated by Claude may have been falsified. There is a lack of
verifiable information and technical details. The report claims that
the AI autonomously executed a significant portion of the attack, but
it fails to provide IoCs, TTPs, or evidence to support its claims. 

 I THINK NOBODY WANTS AI IN FIREFOX, MOZILLA (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Mozilla is developing "Window AI," a new, opt-in browsing mode for
Firefox, aiming to integrate AI functionalities more deeply than
current third-party chatbot integrations. Early feedback from
volunteers helping to shape the feature has been negative, with users
rejecting the idea of AI in Firefox. 

 AGI FANTASY IS A BLOCKER TO ACTUAL ENGINEERING (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is bad for
actual engineering. The belief in AGI, particularly within companies
like OpenAI, is being used to justify environmentally damaging and
exploitative practices in the pursuit of limitless scaling. AGI's
supposed high expected value relies on arbitrary and unfalsifiable
estimations while ignoring tangible negative externalities.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW TO ADD ENTERPRISE SSO & SCIM TO ANY PRODUCT, WITHOUT MIGRATING
YOUR AUTH TO A 3RD PARTY (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Every mid-market and enterprise client expects SSO and SCIM, but they
can be complex to implement. With PropelAuth BYO [11], you can add
both without dealing with identity protocols. No migration, no giving
up user data to a third party, no rewriting your auth system. Read the
blog [11] 

 SUPERCOOKIE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Supercookie is a method that uses favicons to create a persistent,
unique identifier for website visitors, even in incognito mode and
after clearing browsing data. It exploits how browsers cache favicons,
allowing servers to track whether a browser has loaded specific
favicons, creating a unique fingerprint. This tracking method affects
major browsers and is difficult for users to clear. 

 BOA (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Boa is an experimental JavaScript engine written in Rust that
supports over 90% of the latest ECMAScript specification. It has a
live WASM demo and a CLI option, and it's composed of several crates
for different functionalities like AST, parsing, and garbage
collection. The engine can be easily integrated into Rust projects
using the `boa_engine` crate. 

 GOTESTS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Gotests is a Go test generator that automates the creation of
table-driven tests from Go source code. It has zero-config test
generation, smart scaffolding, flexible filtering, and support for Go
generics.

 COINBASE DATA BREACH TIMELINE DOESN'T ADD UP: I HAVE RECORDINGS &
EMAILS PROVING ATTACKS STARTED MONTHS BEFORE THEIR 'DISCOVERY' (12
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article goes over the personal experience of a sophisticated
phishing attack targeting a Coinbase user in January. The author
reported the attack, which involved the scammer possessing detailed
personal information, to Coinbase, but received no response to their
crucial question of how the attacker obtained the data. Coinbase later
disclosed a data breach in May, attributing it to bribed overseas
customer support contractors, but the author's earlier experience
suggests the breach was active months prior. 

 BEHIND THE COMPLAINTS: OUR INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESSURE
ON ARCHIVE.TODAY (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AdGuard DNS was contacted by the Web Abuse Association Defense
(WAAD), which demanded that it block Archive.today for hosting illegal
content, with implied threats of legal action under French law.
AdGuard's investigation revealed WAAD to be a recently formed, opaque
organization with suspicious activities, potentially impersonating
individuals and making false reports. AdGuard has filed a complaint
with the French police and is investigating the connection between
WAAD and the real lawyer.
