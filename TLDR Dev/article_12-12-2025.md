cloud resources on inefficient, overly complex Kubernetes deployments,
this Qovery guide [5] is for you. 

Read Kubernetes Best Practices for Production in 2026 [5] to learn:

1️⃣ How to implement specific resource management configurations
and AI-powered operations to cut cloud costs.

2️⃣ What Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) and liveness/readiness
probes can do to prevent downtime.

3️⃣ Which HPA, VPA, and Cluster Autoscaler configs will help you
adapt to any traffic spike.

 DENIAL OF SERVICE AND SOURCE CODE EXPOSURE IN REACT SERVER COMPONENTS
(6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The React team has disclosed new high-severity Denial of Service
(DoS) and medium-severity Source Code Exposure vulnerabilities in
React Server Components. The DoS allows malicious requests to hang
servers, while the exposure can leak hardcoded secrets from server
functions, though neither enables Remote Code Execution. These issues
are follow-ups to the recent React2Shell vulnerability. Previous
patches (19.0.2, 19.1.3, and 19.2.2) were incomplete. 

 RED HERRINGS AND AI SLOP: DEBUNKING REACT2SHELL MISINFORMATION (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article debunks widespread misinformation about the React2Shell
vulnerability, explaining how React's 700-line obfuscated patch led
researchers and AI tools to chase false leads like the $F primitive
and property traversal gadgets that couldn't actually be exploited.
The real vulnerability occurs much earlier in the RSC request
lifecycle than expected, affecting any server processing RSC requests
through multipart/form-data payloads with specific Flight protocol
operators.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 PROGRAMMERS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS LOST THE PLOT ON NAMING THEIR
TOOLS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Modern software development increasingly uses obscure or "fun" names
for tools and libraries, rather than descriptive ones, causing a
cognitive burden for developers. This is different from other
engineering fields and earlier programming practices, which prioritize
clarity and function in their naming. 

 CRAFT SOFTWARE THAT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL SOMETHING (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This dev paused his development on Boo, a personal code editor they
built solely for themselves, to work on a new programming language.
Boo was never intended for mainstream use or open-sourcing, and the
repetitive work of it ruined their joy and ability to create inspiring
software.

 SHOPIFY'S WINTER '26 EDITION PUTS AI AGENTS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Shopify's developer platform is now AI-native [10]. Your AI agents
can create dev stores, scaffold apps, run GraphQL operations, and
generate validated code across Shopify. The shopify.dev docs now
render for LLM access on the server side - allowing agents to deliver
more accurate code and answers. See all the new developer features
[10] 

 INTRODUCING GPT-5.2 (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI has launched GPT-5.2, its most advanced frontier model,
designed for professional knowledge work and long-running agents. This
new model sets state-of-the-art benchmarks across various areas,
including coding, long-context understanding, vision, tool-calling,
and factuality, performing at or above human expert levels in
knowledge tasks. 

 VOTE FOR THE WEB FEATURES YOU WANT TO SEE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A new upvote system has been launched across web platforms like
web.dev and caniuse.com for devs to directly vote for which web
features are most important to them for browser vendors to prioritize.

 AN SVG IS ALL YOU NEED (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SVG files can be used to create interactive, permanent, and shareable
environments for scientific papers. They are powerful vector graphics
that can embed data, be processed client-side to generate
visualizations, and have interactive controls without server-side
support. This makes them durable and easily shareable. 

 PRODUCT ENGINEERING TEAMS MUST OWN SUPPLY CHAIN RISK (12 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Modern software products are assembled from various third-party
components, creating a complex "software supply chain" that is an easy
target for attacks due to historically implicit trust. This
vulnerability leads to risks like credential theft and widespread
compromise, negatively impacting product outcomes, customer trust, and
business revenue. The solution is to make trust explicit and
verifiable using cryptographic attestations and frameworks to prove
the origin and integrity of dependencies.

 BIDICALC (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 bidicalc is a bidirectional calculator that can change variable cells
so that formula results match changes made. 

 HOW AI CODING AGENTS HID A TIMEBOMB IN OUR APP (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 If something matters, you have to encode it as a test, not just write
a comment about it. 

 DEPRECATE LIKE YOU MEAN IT (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Traditional deprecation warnings are ineffective, so a funny way to
force migration to newer versions is to make deprecated functions
progressively return incorrect results. 

 BUILD WITH GEMINI DEEP RESEARCH (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Gemini Deep Research is now available to developers via the new
Interactions API.
