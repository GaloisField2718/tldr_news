 WHY IS THERE ALWAYS A MEETING BOT IN YOUR ZOOM CALL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Blame Recall.ai [4].

They secretly power every meeting bot and desktop recording app, from
Cluely to Hubspot to Clickup.

Recall.ai [4] handles the hard part: getting clean recordings,
transcripts, and metadata across Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams,
in-person meetings, and more - so developers don't have to.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING BULLETPROOF REACT COMPONENTS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 “Bulletproof" React components are designed to withstand the
"hostile" real-world conditions beyond the typical happy path. Fragile
components often break when encountering challenges like server
rendering, hydration, multiple instances, or concurrent execution.
There are various ways of making React components server-proof,
hydration-proof, instance-proof, and composition-proof. 

 INTRO TO PYTORCH (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework by Meta AI. This visual
learning guide begins by explaining tensors as its fundamental data
type for numerically representing diverse data like text and images,
detailing their initialization and mathematical operations. It then
goes into Autograd, PyTorch's engine for automatic differentiation,
which efficiently calculates gradients essential for neural network
optimization via algorithms like gradient descent.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HOW NOT TO ANSWER THE SALARY QUESTION (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Job seekers should avoid answering the salary question too early in
the interview process. Discussing salary before understanding the full
job responsibilities and benefits is unhelpful for both parties and
can lead to being undervalued. Candidates should deflect the question
by focusing on industry-standard ranges, the comprehensive benefits
package, or the detailed nature of the role itself. 

 COMPONENTS WILL KILL PAGES (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI chat is replacing the need to click through websites, so instead
of building page flows, companies should build component libraries
that AI can understand and render inline. For example, Cloudflare can
show you an interactive workflow diagram right inside ChatGPT.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CLERK'S NEW PRICING: 50,000 MRUS FREE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 First major pricing update since 2023. Free tier now covers 50,000
monthly retained users (up from 10,000 MAUs), MFA included in Pro at
$20/mo, and unlimited apps on every plan. Automatic volume discounts
as you scale.

See the new plans [11]

 MODERN CSS (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Modern CSS is a resource dedicated to updating developers on modern
CSS practices, urging them to abandon outdated hacks from 2015. It
shows modern, native CSS solutions side-by-side with the older, often
JavaScript-reliant techniques they replace. The site covers a wide
range of common challenges, including layout, form validation,
animations, color management, and workflow improvements. 

 WEBMCP (WEBSITE) [13] 

 The WebMCP API is a new JavaScript interface that enables web apps to
expose their functionality as "tools" for AI agents. Web developers
can register these tools, which are JavaScript functions with natural
language descriptions and structured schemas, through a ModelContext
interface. This allows various agents, including LLM-based AI
platforms, browser agents, and assistive technologies, to invoke
client-side web application logic. 

 TWO NEW SHOWBOAT TOOLS: CHARTROOM AND DATASETTE-SHOWBOAT (10 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Chartroom and datasette-showboat expand the capabilities of a CLI
tool, Showboat, which assists coding agents in creating Markdown
documents to demonstrate their code. datasette-showboat enables
Showboat's new remote publishing feature, allowing incremental updates
of documents to a Datasette instance for real-time viewing, addressing
the previous delay in seeing agent-generated content. Chartroom is a
CLI charting tool designed for coding agents to easily generate and
embed various chart types, such as bar, line, and scatter graphs, with
alt text directly into Showboat documents.

 OWNING A $5M DATA CENTER (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Comma.ai built its own $5M data center instead of using the cloud and
estimates it saved $20M+ by doing it. Its 600 GPUs and 4PB of storage
are cooled by big fans and San Diego air, all maintained by just a
couple of engineers. The philosophy is that owning your compute forces
better engineering. 

 SAM “CLAWS” ATTENTION BACK OPENAI (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI has hired Peter Steinberger, the developer behind the viral AI
agent OpenClaw. This acquisition aims to revitalize OpenAI's coding
tools and reclaim developer mindshare from rivals like Anthropic by
focusing on practical, "embedded intelligence" agents. The hiring also
provides OpenAI with a new narrative for investors about personal
autonomous agents, while simultaneously being a win over competitors
Meta and Anthropic. 

 HARD PROBLEMS IN SOCIAL MEDIA ARCHIVING (14 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Institutions face challenges in archiving social media, which differ
greatly from individual efforts. Some difficulties include the
overwhelming scale of content, the struggle to preserve private or
ephemeral media, and capturing the dynamic user experience and opaque
algorithms.

 WHAT YOUR BLUETOOTH DEVICES REVEAL ABOUT YOU (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Widely enabled Bluetooth devices continuously broadcast signals that
passively expose a surprising amount of personal metadata and presence
patterns. 

 USE PROTOCOLS, NOT SERVICES (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Using decentralized communication protocols instead of centralized
services is essential to protect user privacy. 

 WHAT TO DO IF YOU TAKE AGI SERIOUSLY (27 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 AI's progress, fastest where correctness is cheaply verifiable,
demands strategic adaptation to navigate economic shifts, mitigate
profound risks, and leverage its potential. 

 USING AI TO SHIFT E2E TEST MAINTENANCE LEFT (11 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Monday.com engineers developed an AI system that analyzes E2E test
failures during code review to provide contextual explanations tied to
pull request changes.
