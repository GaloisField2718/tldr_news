 YOUR AI WRITES CODE FASTER THAN YOU CAN REVIEW IT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Code review is the bottleneck. Reviews are slow, inconsistent, and
noisy. AI tools flag everything or miss critical issues. 

Qodo [4] is a multi-agent AI code review platform built for real
issues, not noise. Specialized agents reason with full codebase and PR
history context, delivering fixes developers actually commit. 

Benchmarked #1 [5] in precision and recall.

With Rules [6], Qodo goes further: 

→ Auto-discovers standards from code and PR history 
→ Enforces across every repo, every PR 
→ Measures violations and adoption 

Real issues caught. Standards enforced. Quality shipped.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 POSTGRESQL BLOAT IS A FEATURE, NOT A BUG (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 PostgreSQL bloat is a fundamental design feature where databases grow
and queries slow down due to the accumulation of old data versions.
This occurs because the database's Multi-Version Concurrency Control
(MVCC) creates new physical tuples for every update and only marks old
ones as obsolete upon deletion, rather than overwriting or erasing
them. These "dead tuples" consume disk space, force the system to
perform unnecessary I/O by scanning full pages, and contribute to
index bloat. 

 VIRTUAL SCROLLING FOR BILLIONS OF ROWS — TECHNIQUES FROM HIGHTABLE
(30 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 HighTable is a React component that lets you scroll through billions
of rows in a browser table smoothly. It only loads and renders the ~30
rows you can actually see at any given time. The tricky part is that
browsers cap element heights at ~17M pixels, so the creative solution
is to use a downscaled scrollbar plus a dual scrolling mode (small
gestures scroll locally with pixel precision, big ones jump globally).


 WE RALPH WIGGUMED WEBSTREAMS TO MAKE THEM 10X FASTER (9 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Vercel found that WebStreams were a huge bottleneck in Next.js server
rendering. The streams were burning CPU on Promise allocations for
every chunk. Vercel built fast-webstreams, a drop-in replacement that
collapses piping chains into a single Node.js pipeline() call with
zero Promises per chunk, with the end goal of merging this package
into Node.js itself soon.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHEN INTERFACES BECOME DISPOSABLE (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A new parent used AI coding to create a custom interface for his
Fitbit data, addressing his unique sleep tracking needs that the
standard app couldn't fulfill. This bespoke tool is an example of
disposable software. AI agents are increasingly enabling users to
bypass traditional interfaces and directly access product capabilities
via APIs, creating a fragmented landscape where custom solutions are
easily generated. 

 WHAT IS HAPPENING TO WRITING? (19 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 There's widespread acceptance of AI-generated slop in writing.
Despite the allure of AI's efficiency, genuine writing is an
irreplaceable process of solitary thought, labor, and public
engagement. It's good to be aware of cognitive debt from over-reliance
on AI.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 😓 TRYING TO DEBUG A REQUEST THAT TOUCHED 5 SERVICES? (SPONSOR)
[12] 

 Distributed systems help you move faster…until you have to debug
them. This guide [12] shows how to use Sentry tracing and logging to
follow a request end to end. You don't need prior microservices
experience to follow these steps. Read the blog and start fixing [12] 

 REACT DOCTOR (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 React Doctor is an open-source tool designed to help coding agents
diagnose and fix issues in React codebases. It scans projects for
security, performance, correctness, and architecture problems,
outputting a 0-100 score with actionable diagnostics. 

 ELECTROBUN V1 (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Electrobun v1 is a new desktop application framework for building
ultra-fast, tiny, and cross-platform apps with TypeScript. It has
first-class support for macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu, providing
automatic installers, robust auto-updates, and advanced features like
true process-isolated webviews (OOPIF). 

 SLOWMO (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Slowmo is a tool designed to universally control the time of web
content, allowing users to slow down, pause, or speed up animations
and other time-based elements. It has purposes such as debugging
animations, studying interactive web demos, and adjusting the
difficulty of web games.

 GRANDPA LISSAJOUS – A 13-AGENT AI ORCHESTRATION LOOP (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 The Grandpa Loop uses 13 Simpsons-themed AI agents to automate
software development through non-linear feedback loops. It has
adversarial spec reviews, automated builds, and manual-style UX
testing. A central observer agent monitors performance data to tune
the pipeline, making sure the system self-corrects and improves cycle
times. 

 YOU ONLY THINK THEY WORK FOR YOU (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 External vendors prioritize industry relationships over individual
clients. To maximize value, leaders should treat consultants as
educators to gain strategic knowledge. This shift is especially
important as AI agents begin automating PR and distribution,
potentially creating "black box" processes that muddy operational
insights. 

 SPELL CHECKING A YEAR'S WORTH OF HACKER NEWS (12 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Using Claude Haiku 4.5 and Gemini 3 Flash, the author identified
1,430 errors across 7,000 Hacker News blogs. After manual validation,
404 emails were sent, with a 50% response rate. This is an example of
AI's potential for automated kindness and the need for
human-in-the-loop verification.
