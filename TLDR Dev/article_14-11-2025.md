ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 RAFT CONSENSUS IN 2,000 WORDS (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Raft consensus algorithm allows multiple servers to act as a
single reliable system, even with failures. Raft elects a leader to
manage log replication to followers, making sure of data consistency
using AppendEntries messages and an induction process. Leader election
is based on up-to-date logs and majority votes, guaranteeing leader
completeness and state machine safety. 

 WHY DO WE NEED DITHERING? (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Dithering was initially necessary to simulate more colors than
available in early computing due to memory limitations. It involves
using limited palettes and adding noise with neighboring colors to
create gradients, tricking the eye into perceiving a smoother
transition. Ordered dithering uses a threshold map, while error
diffusion algorithms, like Floyd-Steinberg, distribute the error to
neighboring pixels for a less patterned result.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 VALVE IS ABOUT TO WIN THE CONSOLE GENERATION (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Valve is poised to dominate the next console generation with its new
Steam Machine, Steam Controller, and Steam Frame. The Steam Machine,
with PC-level specs and an open SteamOS, offers freedom for users to
install any software or even other operating systems, making it a
unique and developer-friendly console. The Steam Frame, a standalone
VR headset, uses rendering techniques for optimized performance and
also runs the full SteamOS. 

 THINK IN MATH. WRITE IN CODE (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Programmers often prioritize programming language features over their
primary purpose: instructing machines rather than expressing ideas,
which is better suited for flexible mediums like mathematics. Devs
should “think in math,” which means using logical models and
deductions to understand problems before coding to create better
solutions. 

 NEEDY PROGRAMS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There's a shift in software design where programs now demand more
from users than they offer. Mandatory accounts, constant updates,
intrusive notifications, and annoying onboarding processes are driven
by the program's needs, not the user's. Programs that quietly serve
their function without demanding attention or personal information are
better.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AI-NATIVE MOBILE TESTING THAT LETS YOU SHIP FAST WITH CONFIDENCE
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Ship mobile features faster without babysitting brittle Appium
suites. With Momentic [11], you describe user flows in plain English
and AI runs them live against your app. Free up your team's valuable
time to ship product instead of chasing flaky tests. Book a customized
demo [12]. 

 INTRODUCING GPT-5.1 FOR DEVELOPERS (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI has released GPT-5.1, a new model in the GPT-5 series designed
for agentic and coding tasks that balances intelligence and speed.
GPT-5.1 dynamically adjusts its reasoning time based on task
complexity, offers a "no reasoning" mode for faster responses on
simpler tasks, and includes extended prompt caching for improved
efficiency. It introduces new tools like the apply_patch tool for
reliable code editing and a shell tool for executing commands. 

 JSON REPAIR (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 JSON Repair is a JavaScript library that automatically fixes various
types of errors in invalid JSON documents, offering both standard and
streaming APIs. It can be used via the command line or in Python with
PythonMonkey. 

 DBOS TRANSACT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 DBOS provides lightweight, durable workflows built on Postgres,
allowing for reliable code that survives failures without losing
state. It achieves this by checkpointing workflow steps in a Postgres
database, allowing programs to recover from the last completed step
after a failure. DBOS integrates into existing Java programs with
minimal code, durable workflows, asynchronous execution, queues,
scheduling, and notifications.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ZED IS OUR OFFICE (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Zed Industries uses its own text editor, Zed, as its virtual office,
with collaboration as a core feature. Zed's collaboration tools, built
from the ground up, have easy setup, low latency, and fast merging of
edits via CRDTs. Its virtual office is organized with channels for
company-wide discussions, project-specific collaboration, and personal
focus time. 

 RUST IN ANDROID: MOVE FAST AND FIX THINGS (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Android's adoption of Rust is proving to be a successful memory
safety strategy, with vulnerabilities dropping below 20% and Rust code
showing a 1,000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density
compared to C/C++. Surprisingly, Rust also accelerates development,
with 4x lower rollback rates and 25% less time in code review. Android
is expanding Rust's use in the kernel, firmware, and applications to
further improve security and productivity.

 I AM A PROGRAMMER, NOT A RUBBER-STAMP THAT APPROVES COPILOT GENERATED
CODE (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Enforced AI assistance in programming is transforming programmers
from creators into mere approvers of AI-generated code, potentially
devaluing the profession. 

 WHY AGENTS DO NOT WRITE MOST OF OUR CODE (10 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Despite the hype, AI agents are not yet capable of writing most of
this company's code due to issues like loss of mental model of the
codebase, absence of self-reflection in AI, and the current inability
of AI to consistently deliver meaningful productivity boosts in
complex tasks. 

 IBM PATENTED EULER'S 200 YEAR OLD MATH TECHNIQUE (9 MINUTE READ) [20]


 IBM got a patent on the application of derivatives to find
convergents of generalized continued fractions, a mathematical
technique developed by Euler and others centuries ago, by simply
implementing it in PyTorch and labeling it as AI interpretability.
