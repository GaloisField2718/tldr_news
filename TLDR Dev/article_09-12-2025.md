 DOCUSIGN SHIPS NEW MCP SERVER (BETA) + AI AND API FEATURES THAT
DEVELOPERS WILL LOVE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Complex workflows, manual steps, and inaccessible agreement data slow
developers down. The latest Docusign for Developers release [5]
simplifies agreement processes, surfaces insights, and helps
developers deploy faster.

→ BUILD FASTER WITH SMARTER TOOLS: Use AI to generate access tokens,
test APIs, and automate workflows with the DOCUSIGN MCP SERVER working
in tools like Claude and _soon_ ChatGPT. Get answers without leaving
your IDE with the DOCUSIGN DEVELOPER AI ASSISTANT FOR VS CODE.

→ AUTOMATE THE AGREEMENT LIFECYCLE: Trigger and embed agreement
workflows in your apps with the MAESTRO API. 

→ EXTRACT AGREEMENT INSIGHTS: Turn unstructured agreements into
structured, queryable data using AI with the NAVIGATOR API.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 REACT ROUTER'S TAKE ON REACT SERVER COMPONENTS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 React Router is introducing experimental support for React Server
Components (RSC), which improves performance by allowing UI to be
rendered on the server. Developers can now return pre-rendered UI
directly from loaders or make entire routes server components,
reducing client-side hydration and payload size. The integration also
supports server functions for component-level data mutations and
client components for interactive elements. 

 93% FASTER NEXT.JS IN (YOUR) KUBERNETES (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Watt made Next.js 93% faster in K8s (182ms → 11.6ms) by ditching
PM2's ~30% IPC tax and letting the Linux kernel distribute connections
directly via SO_REUSEPORT. Traditional approaches aren't great because
PM2 adds coordination overhead, and single-CPU pods can't self-heal
when their event loop gets blocked. 

 HOW EXCHANGES TURN ORDER BOOKS INTO DISTRIBUTED LOGS (21 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Order books are distributed logs of market events. This architecture
guarantees fairness through deterministic ordering. Modern exchanges
behave like ultra-low-latency log processors. The sequencer defines
the timeline, the matching engine reduces that timeline into a book,
and replication keeps the log durable without slowing the fast path.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 HAS THE COST OF BUILDING SOFTWARE JUST DROPPED 90%? (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Agentic coding with AI is poised to drop the cost of building
software by up to 90%. This reduction is due to AI agents automating
traditionally labor-intensive tasks like testing, API development, and
infrastructure setup, reducing implementation time and project
overhead. This shift is expected to increase latent demand for
software. 

 DEPRECATIONS VIA WARNINGS DON'T WORK FOR PYTHON LIBRARIES (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 urllib3 v2.6.0 contained removals for several APIs that have been
known to be problematic since 2019 and have been deprecated since
2022. The deprecations were marked in the documentation and changelog,
but the team still received feedback that the removal was unexpected
and was breaking dependent libraries. This incident makes it clear
that DeprecationWarning in its current state doesn't work for
deprecating APIs, at least for Python libraries.

 VIBESDK (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Cloudflare VibeSDK is an open-source, full-stack AI web application
generator that allows users to create and deploy applications using
natural language prompts. It has AI code generation with error
correction, live previews in sandboxed containers, interactive chat,
and one-click deployment to Cloudflare Workers for Platforms. 

 MERMAID TO MOTION (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Fanfa is a tool that turns Mermaid into a cinematic SVG animation.
Users can choose from several themes, edit arrow types, and control
the animation speed. They can then export the diagram as a PNG, SVG,
or PDF document. A live, editable example is available on the site.

 THE HIGHEST QUALITY CODEBASE (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This developer ran an experiment where they looped an agent over a
codebase for 36 hours to see what it did. The experiment resulted in
more code to be maintained, most of it largely useless. The agent
added tons of tests, but removed the tests that mattered the most. The
resulting app still worked, but with a few new bugs. 

 A BRIEF HISTORY OF SPECIFIERS AND PROTOCOLS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Node.js introduced the node: protocol in 2021. Deno intro dude https
imports in 2018, and then the npm: protocol in 2022. Deno then
introduced package.json support in 2023 and the jsr: protocol in 2024.
Also in 2024, Deno started moving away from HTTP imports. The current
landscape is a messy state of affairs. 

 GOAL SETTING FOR PRODUCTIVE ENGINEERS (11 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Engineers often struggle to achieve long-term career goals due to
chaotic work environments. To combat this, this article proposes two
goal-setting approaches: top-down goals for clear outcomes and
bottom-up "tiny experiments" for ambiguous situations.

 THE RECIPE FOR 100% AUTOMATABLE TEST COVERAGE IN WEEKS (SPONSOR) [19]


 Blending actual human engineers + AI-assisted review + in-house
tooling to build stable Playwright tests directly in your repo =

 IBM TO ACQUIRE CONFLUENT (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 IBM is acquiring Confluent in an all-cash deal for $31.00 per share
to unify enterprise data and scale AI across organizations by using
Confluent's real-time data streaming platform. 

 SCALA 3 SLOWED US DOWN? (5 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Libraries can behave very differently between Scala versions,
especially when they rely on meta-programming. 

 MICROSERVICES SHOULD FORM A POLYTREE (5 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 To avoid the common complexities and failures of microservices,
dependency structures should form a "polytree,” a directed acyclic
graph whose underlying undirected graph is a tree, to guarantee clear
ownership, predictable behavior, and easier system evolution.
