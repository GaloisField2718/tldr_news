ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILD YOUR OWN DATABASE (13 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This article goes over how to build a key-value database from
scratch. It starts with a simple file-based approach for storing data,
but explains its inefficiency for updates and deletes. It then
introduces append-only files, compaction strategies to manage file
size, and indexing to improve search performance. Finally, it explains
how these techniques combine to form a Log-Structured Merge Tree (LSM
Tree), used in many real-world key-value databases. 

 HOW IDEALIST.ORG REPLACED A $3,000/MO HEROKU BILL WITH A $55/MO
SERVER (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Idealist reduced its Heroku costs by switching its staging
environments to a single, cheaper server. By sharing a single Postgres
instance across multiple isolated staging environments, it avoided
Heroku's per-environment pricing model and expensive add-ons. 

 MEASURING ENGINEERING PRODUCTIVITY (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This is a system for measuring engineering productivity effectively,
with an emphasis on visibility and context over strict numerical
evaluation. Solid productivity happens by starting small, being
explicit with expectations, and being open to feedback to ensure the
system serves as a tool for improvement rather than a weapon for
punishment.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 YOU CANNOT OUTSOURCE UNDERSTANDING (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Businesses often try to eliminate developers, believing they can
achieve software benefits without them, but this approach consistently
fails. The core issue is that software development isn't just about
production, it's about understanding and adapting to complex business
needs, which cannot be outsourced, automated, or abstracted away. 

 SOLVING THE WRONG PROBLEM (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI-assisted coding, despite its impressive capabilities, may be
addressing the wrong problem in software development. AI agents often
recreate existing code due to the nature of LLMs and training data.
Furthermore, AI is primarily benefiting less experienced developers
and masking underlying issues like inadequate software engineering
education and a focus on speed over quality. 

 THE PROGRAMMER IDENTITY CRISIS (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The rise of AI and LLMs threatens the core identity of programmers as
craftspeople. Vibe-coding and specification engineering have turned
programmers into operators rather than creative problem-solvers. This
shift removes a lot of the joy and fulfillment of programming. 

🚀 

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CHATGPT ATLAS (WEBSITE) [10] 

 OpenAI has released a new browser, ChatGPT Atlas. It allows users to
open a ChatGPT sidebar for content summarization, data analysis, and
product comparison on any website. It remembers user preferences and
browsing history (with privacy controls) to provide relevant and
personalized details. It also allows ChatGPT to interact with sites to
complete tasks like research and shopping. 

 NEXT.JS 16 (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Next.js 16 is now available, with improvements to Turbopack, caching,
and the Next.js architecture. This release introduces Cache Components
for more explicit caching, Next.js DevTools MCP for AI-assisted
debugging, and proxy.ts to clarify the app's network boundary.
Turbopack is now the default bundler, offering faster builds and
refreshes, and the update also has better routing, improved caching
APIs, and React 19.2 features. 

 KATAKATE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Katakate is an open-source platform for creating and managing secure,
lightweight VM sandboxes for executing untrusted code at scale. It
uses Kubernetes, Kata, and Firecracker. It offers a CLI, API, and
Python SDK for managing sandboxes, and caters to use cases such as AI
agents, custom serverless functions, and hardened CI/CD runners.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LLMS CAN GET "BRAIN ROT"! (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Continuous exposure to low-quality, "junk" web data can cause a
lasting cognitive decline in LLMs. Through controlled experiments,
researchers found that pre-training LLMs on data from X selected for
high engagement or sensationalism negatively impacted reasoning,
long-context understanding, and ethical behavior. The primary error
was identified as "thought-skipping," where models truncated reasoning
steps, and standard fine-tuning methods only partially mitigated the
damage, showing a persistent change in the models' representation. 

 POE BASICS AND BEYOND: WHAT EVERY ENGINEER SHOULD KNOW (7 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Power over Ethernet (PoE) delivers both data and power over standard
Ethernet cables to devices like IP cameras and VoIP phones. This
article explains the difference between endspan (PoE-enabled switches)
and midspan (PoE injectors) devices, along with the evolution of PoE
standards (IEEE 802.3af/at/bt) to support higher power levels. 

 GETTING DEEPSEEK-OCR WORKING ON AN NVIDIA SPARK VIA BRUTE FORCE USING
CLAUDE CODE (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Claude Code can be used to get DeepSeek-OCR running on an NVIDIA
Spark by automating the process within a Docker sandbox. Initially,
Claude Code struggled to do this due to PyTorch and CUDA compatibility
issues, but after being suggested different PyTorch versions, Claude
Code found a compatible version and completed the task. Claude Code
generated notes, scripts, and documentation, including a performance
comparison of different prompts for OCR.

QUICK LINKS

 AI PR INTRODUCES BUGS IN LINUX LTS (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A Linux kernel maintainer used AI to generate code and backports,
resulting in vulnerabilities, bugs, and sloppy commits in Linux LTS
kernels. 

 WIKIPEDIA SAYS TRAFFIC IS FALLING DUE TO AI SEARCH SUMMARIES AND
SOCIAL VIDEO (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Wikipedia's human page views are declining due to the rise of AI
search summaries and the increasing reliance on social video platforms
for information. 

 JUST USE CURL (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Just use cURL for making HTTP requests, instead of using bloated and
unnecessarily complex GUI-based alternatives. 

 THE DEATH OF THREAD PER CORE (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Data processing has shifted away from thread-per-core models due to
increasing core counts, improved IO speeds, and the need to handle
skewed data distributions effectively at the data processing layer
itself.
