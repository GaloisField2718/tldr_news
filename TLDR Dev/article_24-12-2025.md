ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 WE MASS-DEPLOYED 15-YEAR-OLD SCREEN SHARING TECHNOLOGY AND IT'S
ACTUALLY BETTER (11 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Helix is an AI platform where autonomous coding agents work in cloud
sandboxes. Users need to watch their AI assistants work, so the team
replaced WebRTC with a custom WebSocket streaming pipeline. This
wasn't enough because the integration had to work on enterprise
networks, which only use HTTP, HTTPS, and port 443. Eventually, the
team decided to just send JPEG screenshots for individual frames. 

 AI CODE CREATES 1.7X MORE PROBLEMS (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI coding tools are powerful accelerators, but acceleration without
guardrails increases risk. AI-generated code is consistently more
variable, error-prone, and likely to introduce high-severity issues
without the right protections in place. The future of AI-assisted
development is about building systems, workflows, and safety layers
that amplify what AI does well while compensating for what it tends to
miss. Quality requires deliberate engineering, even when using AI
tools.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AGAINST SEMVER (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Semantic versioning is the most standard way of naming versions of
software. Semantic versioning conversions almost never help developers
prevent or remediate breakage when a dependency upgrade breaks code.
Many people claim to be serious about semantic versioning, but do not
have a published contract against which to evaluate changes as
breaking or non-breaking. There are many better alternatives. 

 YOUR TEAM HAS A CONTEXT WINDOW (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Every human has a limited context window they can hold in their
'working memory' to make informed decisions. This is also true for
teams: they have a shared body of knowledge, code, docs,
relationships, and assumptions they must keep active to plan, build,
and operate. When that collective window gets too big, the team slows
down, fragments, and eventually malfunctions. The fix is a deliberate
shrinking and shaping of the context window so the team can think
again.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MICROQUICKJS (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 MicroQuickJS is a JavaScript engine targeted at embedded systems. It
compiles and runs JavaScript programs with as little as 10 kB of RAM.
The engine only supports a subset of JavaScript close to ES5. To
consume less memory, MicroQuickJS uses a tracing garbage collector,
stores strings in UTF-8, and its VM doesn't use the CPU stack. 

 MILLER (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Miller is a command-line tool specifically designed for name-indexed
data formats like CSV, TSV, JSON, and JSONL. It allows users to
manipulate structured data using named fields and perform operations
such as adding, dropping, sorting, aggregating, and converting between
formats. It's great for handling large datasets efficiently.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NO, SERIOUSLY, THE SHADOW DOM SUCKS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The shadow DOM has some situational uses. For example, it lets you
replace iframes, which are notoriously difficult to make look good.
However, it shouldn't be used for everything. It is an anti-pattern,
not best practice. 

 PYTHON TYPING SURVEY 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Meta's survey shows Python developers are split on type hints. They
help catch bugs and improve tooling, but many feel the extra verbosity
kills Python's vibe, especially for smaller projects. Big teams and
codebases see the value, but a lot of devs still prefer keeping Python
lightweight and flexible for moving fast.

QUICK LINKS

 INSTANT DATABASE CLONES WITH POSTGRESQL 18 (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Users can create large database clones in milliseconds by using
filesystem-level copy-on-write functionality. 

 THE HIDDEN COST OF BUZZWORDS IN TECH (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Engineers waste time debating what's “better” in absolute terms
instead of discussing which tradeoffs fit their context. 

 THE IPV4 ADDRESS SWAMP: THE NEW NORMAL (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The exhaustion of IPv4 addresses has led to a new normal where the
entire address space is fragmented, volatile, and dominated by smaller
prefixes. 

 META IS USING THE LINUX SCHEDULER DESIGNED FOR VALVE'S STEAM DECK ON
ITS SERVERS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Meta has found that Valve's scheduler can adapt and work very well on
its large servers. 

 STATIC ALLOCATION FOR COMPILERS (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Static allocation is a forcing function that ensures that everything
has a limit and a natural consequence of these limits.
