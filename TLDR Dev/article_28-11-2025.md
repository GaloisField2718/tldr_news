ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE INPUT STACK ON LINUX (6 HOUR READ) [4] 

 Input handling on Linux can be divided into two parts, separated by a
common layer. Kernel-level handling deals with what happens in the
kernel and how events are exposed to user-space. User-space handling
includes the user-space device manager and hardware database for
device management and setup, the libinput library for general input
and other libraries such as XKB for keyboards, and Widgets, X Server,
X11 window managers, and Wayland compositors. The middle exposed layer
includes the event abstraction subsystem, devtmpfs for device nodes,
sysfs for kernel objects and device attributes, and procfs for an
introspection interface of the input core. 

 HOW JAVA VIRTUAL THREADS SIMPLIFY REACTOR APIS (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Virtual threads simplify concurrency by reducing the cost of waiting
threads. They allow developers to use blocking functions without
needing to refactor existing code or rely heavily on reactive
libraries like Reactor. By using virtual threads, developers can
combine modern reactive workflows with traditional Java code,
improving code maintainability and understanding.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 SHRINKING WHILE LINKING (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This post discusses two ways to significantly reduce the size of a
static library. One uses classic tools like ld and objcopy, while the
other uses LLVM-specific tools. They both produce similar-sized
outputs, but there are some trade-offs. The 'classic' bintools
approach works with both GNU bintools and LLVM bintools, and it's
significantly faster than the LLVM tools, which need to recompile
everything from the intermediate representation to machine code.
However, the LLVM approach works on macOS, Linux, Windows, and
probably others, making it more versatile. 

 WHY STRONG CONSISTENCY? (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Eventual consistency causes pain for both customers and application
builders as it leads to complex workarounds and potential bugs. Strong
consistency, like that implemented in Aurora DSQL, avoids these issues
by ensuring reads reflect the latest data. Aurora DSQL achieves strong
consistency by ensuring storage replicas only return data for a
specific timestamp once they've seen all updates up to that time,
simplifying application development.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SYNCKIT (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 SyncKit is a sync engine that makes it trivial to build local-first
applications. It can create production-ready sync in 3 lines of code.
SyncKit can sync tasks across tabs instantly, even when offline. It
uses true offline-first architecture to ensure apps work anywhere,
even with a bad internet connection. 

 LOWTYPE (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 LowType adds type expressions to method arguments in Ruby. It treats
arguments with default values that resolve to a type instead of a
value as type expressions. LowType enables types in Ruby with the
simplest syntax possible.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LINUS TORVALDS VS. AMBIGUOUS ABSTRACTIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Linus Torvalds has criticized the helper function,
`make_u32_from_two_u16()`, arguing that the issue wasn't abstraction
itself but the function's ambiguity. Torvalds found the helper unclear
because it didn't explicitly state the word order, increasing
cognitive load for the user. This post proposes a clearer alternative,
`make_u32_from_msw_lsw()`, that encodes the word order in the name. 

 MIGRATING FROM GITHUB TO CODEBERG (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Zig programming language project is migrating its main repository
from GitHub to Codeberg due to concerns about GitHub's engineering
decline, buggy infrastructure, and push for AI features that violate
Zig's policies. The move aims to escape vendor lock-in and support a
non-profit platform in response to the increasing concentration of
wealth in tech.

QUICK LINKS

 MANAGING SIDE EFFECTS: A JAVASCRIPT EFFECT SYSTEM IN 30 LINES OR LESS
(10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article introduces a JavaScript Effect System for managing side
effects by describing them as data instead of executing them directly,
improving testability, and allowing for centralized logging and
profiling. 

 A PROGRAMMER-FRIENDLY I/O ABSTRACTION OVER IO_URING AND KQUEUE (11
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 TigerBeetle implemented a programmer-friendly I/O abstraction layer
on top of io_uring and kqueue, enabling efficient and centralized I/O
dispatch with callbacks and context management. 

 BETTER AUTH 1.4 (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Better Auth 1.4 features stateless auth, SCIM provisioning, custom
OAuth state, database join improvements, secondary storage for API
keys, SSO domain verification, JWT key rotation, improved generic
OAuth plugin, bundle size optimizations, and UUID support. 

 HOW WEBSOCKETS WORK (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 WebSockets provide persistent, full-duplex communication channels
over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time data exchange between
a client and server beyond the traditional request-response model of
HTTP. 

 FEEDBACK DOESN'T SCALE (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Feedback becomes overwhelming and loses its actionable signal as the
leader's direct relationships diminish, and the volume of opinions
increases.
