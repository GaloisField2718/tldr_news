 HOW WE TEST A WEB FRAMEWORK (15 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Wasp's testing strategy for its full-stack web framework prioritizes
tests that clearly express input and expected output, favoring courage
over 100% coverage. It also relies on types heavily. Wasp uses
snapshot testing to track code generation changes and Playwright to
validate apps. 

 STYLING MARKDOWN (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Markdown simplifies writing for the web, but styling the resulting
HTML content requires some work. You can either use a pre-defined CSS
framework like Tailwind Typography or create custom CSS to integrate
the markdown's appearance with the overall site design. This article
goes over styling specific elements like headings, images, lists,
quotes, tables, and code blocks for the best looking output.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AI AND HOME-COOKED SOFTWARE (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI is democratizing software creation, letting people with domain
expertise but without coding skills build custom tools for their
specific needs. This "home-cooked software" trend is driven by AI's
ability to generate initial prototypes. 

 WHY YOUR BOSS ISN'T WORRIED ABOUT AI (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The public's understanding of software bugs, while helpful for
regular software, is misleading when applied to AI systems. Unlike
regular software, where bugs are caused by mistakes in code and can be
precisely located and fixed, AI vulnerabilities come from large
training datasets, making the origin of errors difficult to pinpoint
or eliminate entirely. Once a bug is fixed in regular software, it
won't reappear again, but this isn't the case with AI, as even after
retraining, the weird behavior may still be present, but hasn't been
discovered yet.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SENTRY'S AI CODE REVIEW PREDICTS WHAT'S GOING TO BREAK - BASED ON
WHAT'S ALREADY BROKEN (SPONSOR) [8] 

 Code reviews should be less style nits and more "this is going to
break prod". Sentry's AI Code Review blends context and issue
history with the code you just touched [8] - function calls, class or
objects dependencies, database connections - to provide specific and
actionable feedback rather than generic linting advice. Read the blog
[8] 

 PYREFLY (WEBSITE) [9] 

 Pyrefly is a fast Python type checker and language server designed to
speed up IDE features like autocomplete and instant error feedback. It
is fast, type checking over 1.85 million lines of code per second, and
performs comparably to Pyright and MyPy. 

 MINA RICH EDITOR (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Mina Rich Editor is a block-based rich text editor built using
Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. It has full-featured table support,
multi-select image editing, and a drag-and-drop system. The editor
allows for customization through Tailwind CSS. 

 CSS EXTRAS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 CSS Extras is a collection of useful CSS custom functions that use
the `@function` rule. Functionalities include math, color
manipulation, typography, layout, and theming.

 THE STORY OF CODESMITH: HOW A COMPETITOR CRIPPLED A $23.5M BOOTCAMP
BY BECOMING A REDDIT MODERATOR (32 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Codesmith, a $23.5M coding bootcamp, was harmed by a competitor, who
became a moderator of the main coding bootcamp subreddit and launched
a multi-year PR attack. The competitor used their position to distort
narratives, compare Codesmith to a cult, and accuse employees of
nepotism, leading to a drop in student applications and revenue. 

 NPC DIALOGUE TREE SO COMPLEX, IT'S LIKE NAVIGATING A FOREST (2 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Atom Team, the studio behind the game Swordhaven, revealed a complex
NPC dialogue tree resembling a "forest" of nodes. The developers
shared this to show the common struggle of organizing node graphs in
visual programming environments like Unreal Engine. Developers advise
optimizing nodes early or exploring alternative programming methods to
improve workflow and project organization. 

 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS? YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG (28 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Traditional root cause analysis has flaws. A deeper, systems-thinking
approach called CAST (Causal Analysis based on Systems Theory) often
leads to better error reduction for systems. CAST analyzes accidents
by considering the entire system, its constraints, and the
interactions between components over time, rather than focusing on
linear chains of events. Understanding system constraints and
preventing hazardous states are necessary for accident prevention and
mitigation.

 HOW AI HEARS ACCENTS (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Using a fine-tuned AI model and 3D visualization, BoldVoice explored
how accents in English cluster based on their phonetic properties,
showing groupings influenced by geography, immigration, and
colonialism. 

 RUSTPYTHON (WEBSITE) [16] 

 RustPython is an open-source Python 3 interpreter written in Rust. 

 RECAPTCHA MIGRATION TO GOOGLE CLOUD BY THE END OF 2025: WHAT DO YOU
NEED TO DO (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 By the end of 2025, Google will be migrating reCAPTCHA to Google
Cloud, requiring users to create a Google Cloud account, migrate their
sites, update client-side and server-side code to use the new
Assessment APIs, and adjust to a new usage-based pricing model. 

 WHY IS EVERYTHING SO SCALABLE? (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Startups needlessly over-engineer for scalability due to the
pervasive influence of FAANG architecture and developer preferences
for trendy technology, even when simpler, monolithic architectures
would be more cost-effective and efficient in their early stages.
