AI agents allow companies reduce reliance on external SaaS. As a
result, SaaS companies are having challenges to their net revenue
retention. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌

 ESSENTIAL USER MANAGEMENT FEATURES FOR STARTUPS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Startups need solid user management from day one: authentication
(passwords, OAuth, magic links), authorization with role-based access
control, profile management, and security essentials like MFA and
session handling. These features directly impact conversion rates,
reduce support tickets, and keep you compliant with data protection
regulations.

This guide [4] breaks down what to prioritize based on your stage,
when to use an auth provider versus building in-house, and how to
avoid common pitfalls like insecure password storage or broken session
management.

Critical reading if you're evaluating auth solutions or planning your
user management architecture. Get the guide [4]

 HOW AI IS TRANSFORMING THE ADOPTION OF SECURE-BY-DEFAULT MOBILE
FRAMEWORKS (15 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Developers can create secure-by-default features that integrate
seamlessly into existing codebases by adhering to core design
principles such as providing an API that closely resembles existing
patterns, relying solely on public and stable APIs, and designing
frameworks that cover broad bases rather than niche use cases. These
design principles can be used to leverage AI to smoothly adopt
frameworks at scale. The combination of thoughtful framework design
and intelligent automation will be essential to protecting user data
and maintaining trust at scale as code bases grow and security threats
become more sophisticated. 

 HOW A KERNEL BUG FROZE MY MACHINE: DEBUGGING AN ASYNC-PROFILER
DEADLOCK (23 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This dev encountered a persistent machine freeze on their Linux
kernel when using async-profiler for QuestDB. After reproducing the
issue in a QEMU virtual machine, they used GDB to trace the problem to
a specific kernel bug within a `perf_events` subsystem function. This
bug caused a self-deadlock when a high-resolution timer attempted to
cancel itself while its callback was still executing, making all CPUs
unresponsive.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WHAT DOES A DATABASE FOR SSDS LOOK LIKE? (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most relational databases were invented in the 90s and 00s, the era
of spinning disks. Design decisions were made when I/O was slow and
sequential I/O was orders of magnitude faster than random. This post
looks at what would change and what would remain if we had to begin
from scratch to build a new database in 2025. 

 THE `TIME` ELEMENT SHOULD ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The HTML 'time' element is supposed to be a semantic way to express
the exact timestamp of a date, but no browser or assistive technology
actually makes use of it, besides rendering it. It seems to be used by
search engines to show date snippets in search results, but there
aren't any real guidelines for using it. The time element is a good
idea, but in practice, it feels like an unfulfilled promise of
semantic HTML.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SHOPIFY DOUBLES DOWN ON AI IN THE LATEST LARGE UPDATE TO ITS
DEVELOPER PLATFORM (SPONSOR) [9] 

 The '26 Winter Edition [9] adds more advanced AI capabilities to
Shopify: agents can create dev stores, scaffold apps, run GraphQL
operations, and generate validated code across Admin, UI extensions,
Liquid, and Hydrogen. Developers can ask questions in natural language
and receive working, validated code with direct shopify.dev
links. See what's new [9] 

 CLAUDE MEM (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Claude-Mem is a Claude Code plugin that provides a persistent memory
system by automatically capturing tool usage observations and
generating semantic summaries. It injects this relevant context back
into future sessions, allowing Claude Code to maintain knowledge
continuity across projects. 

 METACODE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Metacode provides a standard, Python-syntax-based language and a
ready-made parser for machine-readable comments, similar to how
various Python source code analysis tools interpret and manage special
in-code annotations.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STACK OVERFLOW USERS DON'T TRUST AI. THEY'RE USING IT ANYWAY (56
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI created an "existential moment" for Stack Overflow. In response,
CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar led a pivot, turning the company into
primarily an enterprise SaaS business providing AI-based solutions and
establishing a data licensing operation with major AI labs. Despite
over 80% of users wanting to use AI for code-related topics, only 29%
trust it, so Stack Overflow banned AI-generated answers on its public
platform while also launching AI Assist, which prioritizes its trusted
human-curated content. 

 AI AGENTS ARE STARTING TO EAT SAAS (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI agents allow companies to build customized solutions more easily
and reduce reliance on external SaaS. This shift is already shown as
engineers use agents to quickly create internal dashboards, code
wrappers, and UI/UX mockups. As a result, SaaS companies, especially
those offering simpler back-office or CRUD-based tools, are having
challenges to their net revenue retention.

QUICK LINKS

 GRAPHQL: THE ENTERPRISE HONEYMOON IS OVER (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GraphQL, despite solving a niche problem like overfetching, often is
a net negative in enterprise environments because its benefits are
frequently redundant with existing BFFs, while introducing more
complexities in implementation. 

 BROWSER SCORE (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Browser Score is a browser testing tool that quickly checks how many
web platform features your browser recognizes and gives it a
percentage score. 

 IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE TO SIT WITH “I DON'T KNOW” (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Human discomfort with admitting "I don't know" drives us to readily
accept convenient, but not always true, certainty, especially from
sources like AI, even when logic suggests these sources are unreliable
on unfamiliar topics. 

 CHECKPOINTING THE MESSAGE PROCESSING (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Checkpointing message processing in event-driven architectures is
similar to save points in old video games.
