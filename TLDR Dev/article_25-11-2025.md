 SIGNADOT: RUN ON-DEMAND K8S SANDBOXES LOCALLY AND HOT RELOAD YOUR
BACKEND. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Spinning up 23 services locally to test a one-liner?

Melting your laptop trying to run everything?

Waiting 20 minutes for CI on every change?

You're doing it wrong...

Signadot [4] gives you on-demand sandboxes connected to your K8s
cluster:

>> Hot reload [4] to test changes E2E and see the entire flow from
frontend to backend.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW WE BUILT THE V0 IOS APP (16 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Vercel's first native iOS app, v0, was built using React Native with
Expo. The focus was on building a smooth, delightful AI chat
experience. The team faced challenges in areas like keyboard handling,
scrolling, and streaming content. They overcame them through
composable code, custom hooks, and even native code patching, using
libraries like LegendList and React Native Keyboard Controller. 

 LOAD TESTING: HOW MANY HTTP REQUESTS/SECOND CAN A SINGLE MACHINE
HANDLE? (16 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Load testing was performed on a single machine to determine how many
HTTP requests per second it can handle, using a Java-based REST API,
PostgreSQL, and DigitalOcean infrastructure. The tests were conducted
on machines with varying CPU and memory configurations, showing that
even a small machine could handle hundreds of requests per second. A
medium machine could handle 500-1,000 RPS, while a large machine
sustained 2,000-3,000 RPS.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 WE STOPPED ROADMAP WORK FOR A WEEK AND FIXED 189 BUGS (11 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 “Fixit” weeks are when the engineering team pauses regular work
to address small bugs and improvements. During one fixit week, 40
people fixed 189 bugs, improving both user experience and developer
productivity. These focused efforts have a lot of benefits on product
quality, individual satisfaction, and team morale, emphasizing the
importance of preparation, a strict time limit, and gamification. 

 THE CLOUDFLARE OUTAGE WAS A GOOD THING (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A Cloudflare outage, caused by a bad config file, temporarily
disrupted access to many popular online services. This outage may be a
good thing, as it showed the dangers of internet centralization and
over-reliance on a few key players. It's similar to COVID-19's impact
on global supply chains, which led to businesses and governments
diversifying supply chains more after 2020.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BUILDING DATABASES FOR THE CLOUD-NATIVE AND GENAI ERA (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Data-driven organizations require an agile, cloud-native database to
support modern cloud infrastructure and application architectures.
DISTRIBUTED SQL DATABASES FOR DUMMIES [10] provides a detailed
explanation of how to meet today's cloud-native, GenAI, and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application demands using a
distributed SQL database architecture_._👉 DOWNLOAD THE EBOOK [10] 

 INTRODUCING CLAUDE OPUS 4.5 (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 is the best model in the world for
coding, agents, and computer use. It outperforms human candidates in
technical skills assessments and shows creative problem-solving
abilities, surpassing previous models in various benchmarks. Opus 4.5
is also the company's most robustly aligned model, with better
security against malicious attacks. 

 INTRODUCING ADVANCED TOOL USE ON THE CLAUDE DEVELOPER PLATFORM (18
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Anthropic has introduced three new beta features on the Claude
Developer Platform to improve AI agent tool use: Tool Search Tool,
Programmatic Tool Calling, and Tool Use Examples. The Tool Search Tool
allows Claude to dynamically discover and load relevant tools,
reducing context window consumption and improving accuracy by avoiding
upfront loading of extensive tool definitions. Programmatic Tool
Calling lets Claude orchestrate multiple tools through code execution.
Tool Use Examples provides concrete examples of tool usage, clarifying
ambiguous parameters and improving the reliability of tool
invocations.

 THREE YEARS FROM GPT-3 TO GEMINI 3 (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Gemini 3 can now code complex tasks, design interfaces, and conduct
research, showing a shift from chatbots to agentic models capable of
acting as digital coworkers. Gemini 3 is capable of PhD-level
research, though it still requires human guidance. 

 THE BITTER LESSON OF LLM EXTENSIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 LLM extensions over the past three years have shifted from complex
protocols like ChatGPT Plugins and MCP to simpler, more accessible
methods. Early attempts at extensive API integrations were hampered by
model limitations, leading to the adoption of straightforward
solutions like custom instructions and repo-level rules. The current
trend, shown by Claude Code's Agent Skills, favors giving agents
general-purpose tools with simple natural language instructions.
