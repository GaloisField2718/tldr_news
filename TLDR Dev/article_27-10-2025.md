 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 THE SEARCH PROBLEM: WHY YOUR COMPUTER FINDS THINGS FASTER THAN YOU DO
(18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post explores the limitations of binary search trees
compared to B-trees when dealing with disk I/O. While binary trees are
efficient in memory, their performance degrades a lot on disk due to
the high cost of each disk access. On the other hand, B-trees, by
storing multiple keys per node that fit within a single disk block,
reduce the number of disk reads required for searching. 

 SOLVED BY MODERN CSS: SECTION LAYOUT (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Building a dynamic section layout can be done using modern CSS
techniques like :has(), container queries, fluid typography with
clamp(), and query units. This article shows how to create responsive
card layouts within the section and adjust the overall layout based on
the number of items. 

 THE BUG THAT TAUGHT ME MORE ABOUT PYTORCH THAN YEARS OF USING IT (32
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This dev discovered a niche PyTorch bug while working on a sparse
autoencoder, where the training loss plateaued due to the encoder
weights failing to update on the Apple Silicon GPU (MPS). The root
cause was traced to some of the Adam optimizer's operations silently
failing to update output tensors on MPS due to the way memory was
handled. A workaround was implemented by creating a contiguous
temporary tensor, performing the operation, and then copying the
results back to the original non-contiguous tensor.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 DIRECTIVES AND THE PLATFORM BOUNDARY (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There is an increasing trend of JavaScript frameworks introducing
custom directives, such as `use client` and `use server`, which
resemble language features but lack standardization. These directives
can cause confusion, complicate debugging, and reduce portability by
blurring the line between the JavaScript platform and specific
frameworks. Explicit APIs with imports give better provenance,
versioning, and tooling ergonomics compared to directives that end up
working as platform “lock-in.” 

 WHY I CODE AS A CTO (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This CTO prioritizes coding despite the conventional wisdom that
senior leaders should primarily manage. He divides his coding efforts
into experimental projects, critical customer requests, and bug fixes.
AI tools help boost his productivity. 

 ADVICE FOR NEW PRINCIPAL TECH ICS (I.E., NOTES TO MYSELF) (14 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 New Principal Tech Individual Contributors (ICs) should balance deep
technical work with broader responsibilities such as providing vision,
mentoring, and connecting teams. A large part of the role involves
teaching the organization to value new ideas and driving initiatives
that might not happen otherwise.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ANNOUNCING THE SWIFT SDK FOR ANDROID (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Android workgroup has announced the nightly preview release of
the Swift SDK for Android, letting devs build native Android
applications using Swift. This SDK helps cross-platform development by
allowing developers to port Swift packages to Android, with over 25%
of packages already compatible. 

 OXDRAW (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Oxdraw is a tool that bridges the gap between code-generated diagrams
(like Mermaid) and manually customizable diagramming software (like
Lucidchart). It allows users to create and fine-tune diagrams using
Mermaid syntax with a web interface for visual adjustments. Edits made
in the interface are saved back to the Mermaid source file as
comments. 

 SHADCNTHEMER (WEBSITE) [17] 

 ShadcnThemer is a platform for discovering, creating, and sharing
custom themes for the shadcn/ui component library.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW WE SAVED $500,000 PER YEAR BY ROLLING OUR OWN “S3” (12 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Nanit reduced costs by creating N3, a Rust-based in-memory landing
zone for video processing, using S3 as a fallback buffer. This removed
PutObject request fees and short-term storage costs associated with
S3's minimum storage duration. The solution uses a two-tier fallback
system, where an N3-Proxy initially redirects uploads to S3 upon
N3-Storage failure, and Camera Service then completely switches to S3
presigned URLs in case of broader N3 issues. 

 THE JOURNEY BEFORE MAIN() (12 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This article explains the journey from when the OS kernel is asked to
run a program to when the `main()` function is executed. The kernel
uses the `execve` system call to load the program, which is usually in
ELF format on Linux. The ELF file contains code, data, and other
information, including an entry point where execution begins.  The
kernel sets up the stack with arguments, environment variables, and
auxiliary vectors before jumping to the `_start` function, which then
initializes the language runtime and calls the user's `main()`
function.

QUICK LINKS

 CODE LIKE A SURGEON (5 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Taking a "software surgeon" approach to coding means using AI tools
for secondary tasks and having devs focus on core design and critical
thinking. 

 YOU ALREADY HAVE A GIT SERVER (3 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 This blog post explains how to use Git on a server to manage and
deploy code, particularly for website content. 

 REACT VS BACKBONE IN 2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Despite advancements and a larger ecosystem, modern frameworks like
React may not represent a large improvement over older frameworks like
Backbone for simple tasks, often trading explicit simplicity for
complex abstractions that can hurt understanding and debugging. 

 FTA: FAST TYPESCRIPT ANALYZER (WEBSITE) [23] 

 FTA is a fast, open-source static analysis tool written in Rust for
TypeScript and JavaScript code that identifies complexity and
maintainability issues.
