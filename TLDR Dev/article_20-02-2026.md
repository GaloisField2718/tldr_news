 DON'T LET MANUAL TESTING DELAY YOUR RELEASE. AGAIN. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You can't fix QA by throwing more bodies at it – not when everyone
is coding 10× faster with AI.

You need an AI counterweight that validates every release on time.

Teams at Nordea, Pricer, and Upsales use QA.tech to cut thousands of
hours of manual testing each month, reduce QA spend, and ship faster.

With QA.tech, you get:

> AI testing agents that scale with your development.

> Shift-left testing that keeps release control in-house.

> No QA bottlenecks.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 I INTERCEPTED 3,177 API CALLS ACROSS 4 AI CODING TOOLS. HERE'S WHAT'S
ACTUALLY FILLING YOUR CONTEXT WINDOW. (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Four AI coding tools had their context windows and token usage
analyzed while fixing a specific bug in Express.js. Despite all tools
successfully solving the bug, their token consumption varied a lot,
with Gemini Pro using up to 350,000 tokens compared to Claude Opus's
23,000. Each tool used a distinct strategy: Opus was surgical but
carried high tool definition overhead, Sonnet was methodical, Codex
efficiently used Unix-like commands, and Gemini aggressively dumped
vast amounts of data into its context. 

 YOUR AGENT FRAMEWORK IS JUST A BAD CLONE OF ELIXIR: CONCURRENCY
LESSONS FROM TELECOM TO AI (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Modern AI agent frameworks in Python and TypeScript are similar to
the Elixir/Erlang BEAM virtual machine, which solved similar
concurrency and fault-recovery challenges for telecom in 1986. The
BEAM's actor model has features like isolated lightweight processes,
message passing, and supervision trees, well-suited for the
long-lived, non-deterministic interactions of AI agents.

 THE END TO A 7.5-YEAR CAREER (24 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This DevRel engineer is ending a 7.5-year career at Google after
being forcibly re-organized onto a new team focused on AI products,
which conflicted with her moral values and long-standing dedication to
Firebase. This new role also involved a manager with whom she felt
psychologically unsafe and untrusting. She took severance to leave. 

 STOP THINKING OF AI AS A COWORKER. IT'S AN EXOSKELETON (11 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 AI should be conceptualized as an exoskeleton that amplifies human
capabilities, rather than an autonomous coworker. Physical
exoskeletons enhance strength, reduce injuries, and improve endurance
in fields like manufacturing and military, without replacing the human
operator. AI should be used the same way.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 EXPO WENT ALL-IN ON CLAUDE CODE FOR A MONTH. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 Expo's web team committed 100% to Claude Code for a month and ended
up with wins, losses, and lessons you can read about in this blog [9].
They also added the ability to prompt Builds and Workflows with Claude
with Expo MCP Server. Try the new MCP server [10] 

 GEMINI 3.1 PRO: A SMARTER MODEL FOR YOUR MOST COMPLEX TASKS (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Google has released Gemini 3.1 Pro, an upgraded core intelligence
model designed for complex problem-solving and advanced reasoning.
This new version has more than double the reasoning performance of
Gemini 3 Pro, and it is specifically built for tasks where simple
answers are insufficient. 

 CMUX (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 cmux is a native macOS terminal application built with Swift and
AppKit that extends the Ghostty experience with vertical tabs and GPU
acceleration. It has an intelligent notification system that visually
alerts users when AI coding agents require attention, along with a
sidebar displaying vital context like git branches and listening
ports. 

 STEP 3.5 FLASH (21 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Step 3.5 Flash is a frontier open-source foundation model by StepFun
that offers efficient, high-speed reasoning and agentic capabilities
with tool use, long context, and local deployment.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MEASURING AI AGENT AUTONOMY IN PRACTICE (31 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Anthropic's research analyzed millions of human-AI agent interactions
across Claude Code and its public API to understand how agents are
used in real-world contexts. It found that agents like Claude Code
operate autonomously for longer periods, and experienced users grant
them more independence (auto-approving more). Claude Code also
proactively pauses for clarification more often than humans interrupt
it on complex tasks. 

 I SEE DEAD PEOPLE (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI systems like Aristotle solve complex mathematical proofs, while
tools like OpenClaw reduce software development tasks from days to
minutes. This exponential feedback loop is similar to the Industrial
Revolution, requiring a fundamental rethink of economic structures to
manage rapid automation.

QUICK LINKS

 WHEN CHANGE BECOMES CHEAPER THAN COMMITMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI accelerates software divergence, making change cheaper than
commitment. 

 AI MAKES YOU BORING (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Relying on AI for creative and intellectual work bypasses the deep
engagement and prolonged thought processes necessary for originality,
ultimately leading to shallow ideas and uninteresting projects. 

 FAREWELL, RUST (16 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A solo founder recounts his decision to migrate his web application
from Rust to Node.js due to Rust's current limitations in web-specific
features, ecosystem maturity, and compilation speed. 

 FFF.NVIM (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 fff.nvim is a Neovim plugin that is a fast file finder, using a
dedicated Rust backend for typo-resistant fuzzy search, live grep, Git
status integration, and image previews.
