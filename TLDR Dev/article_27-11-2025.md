ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING A 64-BIT OS FROM SCRATCH WITH CLAUDE CODE (7 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 SimplicityOS, a real x86_64 OS with a working Forth interpreter, was
developed with Claude Code. Claude did all of the heavy lifting in the
project, including writing all of the assembly code, debugging boot
issues, managing git commits, and creating all of the documentation.
The OS currently has a PS/2 keyboard driver with shift support,
interactive REPL, colon definitions with nesting, variables, comments
and strings, and introspection. The complete development narrative -
every prompt, response, and struggle - is provided in the article. 

 RUNNING UNSUPPORTED IOS ON DEPRECATED DEVICES (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This dev successfully ran iOS 6 on an iPod touch 3, a device
officially limited to iOS 5.1.1, by reverse engineering and modifying
various iOS components. This involved patching the DeviceTree and
iBoot, creating a kernelcache by adapting macOS tools, and making many
changes to the root filesystem, including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi firmware
adjustments.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 RELEASING PACKAGES WITH A VALET KEY: NPM, PYPI, AND BEYOND (10 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Publishing packages to registries requires access tokens. Whoever has
these tokens can publish anything under that organization's name. This
can be an issue if those tokens were stolen. One way to secure against
this is to create a separate repository dedicated entirely to
publishing. This limits write access while still allowing people to
contribute. 

 CLOUDFLARE OUTAGE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED, AND THEY SEEM TO BE
MISSING THE POINT ON HOW TO AVOID IT IN THE FUTURE (5 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Cloudflare's recent outage, caused by an application logic flaw
interacting with a database change, highlights a failure to prioritize
logical data correctness and database design over physical
replication.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 A VERY FAST 64–BIT DATE ALGORITHM: 30–40% FASTER (15 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This article presents a very fast date conversion algorithm that
provides accurate results over a period of ±1.89 trillion years. The
algorithm uses only 4 multiplications, compared to other fast date
algorithms, which have always used 7 or more expensive computations.
It calculates years backwards, which removes various intermediate
steps. The algorithm uses a year-modulus-bit shift technique to
calculate day-of-year, removing a division. It uses the 'Julian Map'
technique to speed up 100/400 year calculation, removing two more
hardware multiplications. 

 SAFE NPM (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 `safe-npm` is a security-focused npm installer that prevents supply
chain attacks by only installing package versions that have been
publicly available for a minimum time (default 90 days). It works by
querying the npm registry, filtering out recent versions, and
installing the newest safe version that meets semver and age
requirements.

 GEMINI CLI TIPS AND TRICKS (92 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Gemini CLI is an open-source AI assistant that brings Google's Gemini
model to the terminal. This is a guide of 30 pro tips for using Gemini
CLI correctly that covers topics like persistent context, custom
commands, extending functionality with MCP servers, memory management,
checkpointing, file referencing, on-the-fly tool creation, system
troubleshooting, automation, and IDE integration. The guide also
describes how to use it with GitHub Actions and custom extensions. 

 WHY (SENIOR) ENGINEERS STRUGGLE TO BUILD AI AGENTS (6 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 A mind trained on strict interfaces will find the transition from
deterministic systems to probabilistic agents uncomfortable because it
requires trading certainty for semantic flexibility. The exact
execution path can no longer be known or owned as the control flow has
been handed to a non-deterministic model and application state is
stored in natural language. Agents need to be managed through evals
and self-correction because probability can't be coded away. Systems
need to be engineered to be resilient enough to handle ambiguity.

QUICK LINKS

 UNIFYING OUR MOBILE AND DESKTOP DOMAINS (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Wikimedia Foundation unified its mobile and desktop domains,
eliminating redirects, improving mobile response times by 20%, and
reducing infrastructure load by streamlining CDN purges. 

 AWS LAMBDA ROADMAP (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This repository contains information about products AWS is working on
so customers can give direct feedback. 

 WHAT NOW? HANDLING ERRORS IN LARGE SYSTEMS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Error handling should be a global property of the system and needs to
be built into the system from the beginning. 

 ONE CANVAS TO RULE THEM ALL: HOW INK GAMES' NEW SITE HANDLES COMPLEX
3D (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 ToyFight created a dynamic website for INK Games using layered 3D,
scroll-driven animations, and a unified WebGL canvas.
