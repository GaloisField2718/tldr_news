ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 DRAWING TEXT ON SCREEN - WHAT COULD BE SIMPLER? (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This dev rewrote a text-based file manager in Go as a learning
exercise, focusing on input and output handling. They used C# and
explored different rendering methods, including console methods, GDI,
DirectX, and Vulkan. They found that direct text drawing with DirectX
performed the best for normal use, better than texture-based caching
despite the latter's advantage in extreme stress test scenarios.
However, efficient text rendering is more complex than it initially
appears. 

 WE RAN OVER 600 IMAGE GENERATIONS TO COMPARE AI MODELS (12 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A long-time developer of iOS photo apps compared the performance of
OpenAI, Gemini, and Seedream AI models on various image editing tasks.
They ran over 600 image generations using naive prompts and
representative photos to assess the trade-offs between quality, prompt
complexity, and pricing for each model. OpenAI was the best at
transformative and creative edits, and Gemini was better for realistic
edits and detail preservation, while Seedream was a good middle
ground. 

 USING ATOMIC STATE TO IMPROVE REACT PERFORMANCE IN DEEPLY NESTED
COMPONENT TREES (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Harbor solved React performance issues in its clinical trial data
capture application by switching from vanilla React Context to atomic
state management with Jotai. The traditional Context approach caused
entire component trees to rerender when any single node's state
changed, which became expensive in their deeply nested "event → form
→ field group → field" hierarchy. By using Jotai's atomic state
system, it was able to create granular state atoms that only trigger
rerenders in components that actually depend on the changed data.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 COLLABORATION SUCKS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Excessive collaboration slows progress in companies. Instead, the
company should have a "driver" mentality where individuals take
ownership and minimize unnecessary feedback. This means defaulting to
shipping, seeking specific input, and prioritizing post-shipment
feedback. 

 VERTICAL INTEGRATION IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS (10 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Vertical integration, which means tight integration between different
tools in a development stack, is necessary for developer productivity.
Examples of such vertically integrated workflows include automated
build artifact sharing and interactive debugging across languages.
While building a vertically integrated development environment as a
product is challenging, the glue code connecting different tools is
where the real value lies.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE JWT SECURITY STACK FOR ENGINEERS AND
ENGINEERING LEADERS (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Looking to understand JSON Web Tokens? AUTH0 has you covered with
full-stack learning resources. The JWT Guide for Product and
Engineering Leaders [12] explains the strategic side: security risks,
scalability concerns, and business impact. The JWT Handbook [13] goes
into implementation: signing algorithms, JWS, JWE, JWK, and best
practices to prevent common vulnerabilities. 

 TUSK DRIFT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The Tusk Drift SDK enables deterministic API testing by recording and
replaying API calls. It captures real-world API interactions and uses
the Tusk CLI to replay them as tests, identifying regressions by
intercepting outbound requests with recorded data. The SDK uses
Node.js and supports various packages and versions, including
HTTP/HTTPS, GRPC, PG, Firestore, and more. 

 ADK FOR GO (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source, code-first Go
toolkit designed for building, evaluating, and deploying AI agents. It
applies software development principles to AI agent creation and makes
the orchestration of agent workflows easier. It is model and
deployment-agnostic, and has a tool ecosystem with modular multi-agent
systems. 

 PERSPECTIVE (WEBSITE) [16] 

 Perspective is an interactive analytics and data visualization
component ideal for large, streaming datasets. It provides a fast,
memory-efficient query engine written in C++ and a framework-agnostic
User Interface as a Custom Element. Perspective can be used in the
browser via WebAssembly or virtually via a WebSocket server using
Python/Node.

 META'S CHIEF AI SCIENTIST YANN LECUN REPORTEDLY PLANS TO LEAVE TO
BUILD HIS OWN STARTUP (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, is reportedly planning to
leave the company in the coming months to start his own startup
focused on world models. LeCun's departure comes at a challenging time
for Meta, which has been restructuring its AI organization amid
concerns it's falling behind competitors like OpenAI and Google. 

 A CATALOG OF SIDE EFFECTS (18 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This blog post discusses different approaches compilers use to track
the effects of Intermediate Representation (IR) instructions, focusing
on how these effects influence optimizations like instruction
re-ordering and dead code elimination. There are two main
representation methods: bitsets, as used in Cinder and other compilers
like HHVM and ART, and heap range lists, as implemented in
JavaScriptCore. Bitsets are compact and precise, while range lists
offer more long-term flexibility.

 A FRIENDLY GUIDE TO FRONT-END DATE PICKERS (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Simpler date selection methods are preferred over complex JavaScript
date pickers due to better usability and accessibility. 

 TYPESCRIPT'S RISE IN THE AI ERA (7 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 TypeScript became the most-used language on GitHub in 2025,
surpassing JavaScript and Python, with over a million new developers
contributing (a 66% year-over-year increase). 

 LEARNING TO MODEL THE WORLD WITH LANGUAGE (7 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Dynalang is an agent that learns to understand and uses multiple
types of language by predicting future text, images, and rewards
within a multimodal world model. 

 WHY EFFORT SCALES SUPERLINEARLY WITH THE PERCEIVED QUALITY OF
CREATIVE WORK (4 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Achieving higher perceived quality in creative work requires a
disproportionately larger effort because the search space for
acceptable refinements shrinks, verification latency increases, and
the process involves a lot of exploration and exploitation.
