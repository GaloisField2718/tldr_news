 STRUGGLING TO SHIP AI? GO FROM RANDOM PROMPTS TO AN AUDIT-BASED,
SPEC-DRIVEN WORKFLOW (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Shifting requirements slowing your AI production cadence? Zenflow [4]
(by Zencoder) is an orchestration platform grounded in well-defined
specs, built-in verification, and parallel execution. 

Here's how it works:

1️⃣ Tell Zenflow what to build and choose a template or custom
pattern that fits your business.

2️⃣ Zenflow's agents [4] execute, verify, and review to catch
issues.

3️⃣ Review and ship verified, production-ready code.

Teams use Zenflow to eliminate rework, reduce regressions, and ship
complex AI features far faster.

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HOW SQLITE IS TESTED (36 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SQLite has a thorough and multi-faceted testing process, with test
code outweighing its core library. This includes four independent test
harnesses that collectively run billions of test cases to verify
functionality, cross-database compatibility, and resilience to
malicious inputs. Specialized anomaly tests simulate and verify proper
handling of out-of-memory conditions, I/O errors, and power loss. 

 THE ART OF VIBE DESIGN (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI made not being a designer or developer less of a barrier. You
provide the vision, and AI writes the code. Implementation used to be
the bottleneck, but now we're only bottlenecked by taste. People who
succeed in the new era will be those who know what they want and can
communicate it clearly. 

 INSIDE POSTHOG: HOW SSRF, A CLICKHOUSE SQL ESCAPING 0DAY, AND DEFAULT
POSTGRESQL CREDENTIALS FORMED AN RCE CHAIN (ZDI-25-099, ZDI-25-097,
ZDI-25-096) (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A security researcher uncovered a critical Remote Code Execution
(RCE) chain in PostHog by chaining several vulnerabilities. The
initial vector was a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability
that bypassed webhook URL validation, allowing an attacker to save and
trigger requests to internal URLs via a Rust worker.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AWS CEO EXPLAINS 3 REASONS AI CAN'T REPLACE JUNIOR DEVS (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 AWS' CEO has argued against replacing junior developers with AI,
saying it is "one of the dumbest ideas" for several reasons. Junior
devs are often the most proficient with new AI tools and, being the
least expensive, don't offer much cost savings when cut. Additionally,
removing them severs a company's talent pipeline. 

 AI'S REAL SUPERPOWER: CONSUMING, NOT CREATING (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI's real superpower is in consumption, not creation. Most people
should use it less for generating content and more for its analytical
capabilities. Connecting AI to a knowledge base, such as an Obsidian
vault filled with notes and reflections, and having it act as a
research assistant, allows it to uncover hidden patterns and connect
disparate ideas across multitudes of information that would be
impossible for a human to process.

 BUILD WITH GEMINI 3 FLASH, FRONTIER INTELLIGENCE THAT SCALES WITH YOU
(5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Gemini 3 Flash is now rolling out to developers. The model offers
powerful performance at less than a quarter of the cost of Gemini 3
Pro. It surpasses Gemini 2.5 Pro across many benchmarks while
delivering faster speeds. The model features Google's most advanced
visual and spatial reasoning and now offers code execution to zoom,
count, and edit visual inputs. 

 TELESCOPE (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Cloudflare's Telescope is a diagnostic, cross-browser performance
testing agent for evaluating web page load performance. When run, it
loads a specified URL in a chosen browser, applies custom parameters,
and collects extensive data. This data includes console output, a
video of the page load, various timing metrics, screenshots, and
filmstrip images, all stored in a dedicated results directory.

 THE STATE OF AI CODING 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI coding tools have increased developer output and PR sizes. In AI
memory, mem0 is the most popular package, while in SDKs, OpenAI and
Anthropic lead. Anthropic models are the best in time-to-first-token,
while OpenAI's GPT-5 series delivers higher throughput and more
cost-effective performance. 

 WEB MONETIZATION IS STILL INCHING ALONG, BUT STILL TOO DIFFICULT (7
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Web Monetization is a developing web standard that would allow users
to automatically send small payments to websites they visit through
built-in browser functionality, similar to how Apple Pay works for
purchases. However, recent attempts to test the current implementation
through browser extensions and wallet providers like GateHub have been
frustrating due to complex setup processes and regional restrictions.
