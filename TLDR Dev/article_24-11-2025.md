ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 SHADERS (29 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Shaders are small programs that run in parallel, using mathematical
calculations and knowledge of x and y coordinates to create
high-fidelity graphics. The graphics pipeline consists of vertex
shading, rasterization, and fragment shading, each playing a specific
role in determining the final color of each pixel. Various APIs like
OpenGL, DirectX, Metal, and CUDA facilitate interaction with the GPU
for both graphics rendering and general-purpose computing tasks. 

 TIL: `SATISFIES` IS MY FAVORITE TYPESCRIPT KEYWORD (4 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The `satisfies` keyword in TypeScript acts as a type-safe cast,
making sure an assignment is assignable to a provided type while
allowing TypeScript to infer a more specific type based on the value.
It's different from explicit variable type annotations, as it's best
when specific type enforcement and value-based type inference are
needed. 

 ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ACT() IN REACT TESTS (8
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The `act()` function in React tests makes sure that all state changes
and side effects are fully processed before assertions run, preventing
tests from checking against outdated state values. While React Testing
Library functions like `userEvent` and `findBy...` automatically wrap
their operations in `act()`, you'll need to manually use it when
testing hooks with state changes, directly calling DOM methods like
`button.click()`, or manually dispatching events.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 ARE CONSUMERS JUST TECH DEBT TO MICROSOFT? (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There's a potential shift in Windows market share among consumer
computers. Microsoft's focus has shifted away from consumers towards
AI and corporate clients, leading to a lack of excitement around
Windows. The rumored affordable MacBook and Valve's Steam Machine are
potential disruptors that could attract consumers and gamers away from
Windows. 

 MARKDOWN IS HOLDING YOU BACK (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Markdown has limitations for technical content due to its lack of
structure and semantic markup. While Markdown is easy to use, its
implicit typing and inconsistent flavors make content reuse, machine
consumption, and scalability harder. Alternatives like
reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, DocBook, and DITA have improved content
structure and transformation capabilities. 

 WHEN EVERYONE'S A DEVELOPER, HOW DO WE PROMOTE THE WEB PLATFORM OVER
REACT? (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI code generation tools are undermining web platform adoption by
defaulting to React/Next.js solutions, especially as "vibe coders"
(non-programmers using AI to create apps) increasingly rely on these
tools without understanding native web capabilities. This trend is
creating worse web experiences, and some solutions include teaching
people to prompt for vanilla web solutions, creating open datasets of
framework-free code, and spotlighting projects that use modern web
features without heavy frameworks.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SMARTCOMMIT (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Smartcommit is an AI-powered CLI tool for creating semantic,
Conventional Commits messages. It analyzes staged changes, asks
clarifying questions about the code's intent, and then generates a
structured commit message. 

 TRAVELS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Travels is a fast, framework-agnostic undo/redo library that uses
JSON patches to store only the differences between states. It is more
memory-efficient than traditional snapshot-based systems. Travels uses
Mutative for fast immutable updates and integrates with popular
frameworks like React, Vue, and Zustand. It has a mutable mode for
reactive states, an archive mode for controlling when changes are
saved, and a maxHistory option to limit memory usage. 

 GITLOGUE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Gitlogue is a command-line tool that visually replays Git commit
history with animated typing, syntax highlighting, and file tree
transitions. It can be used as a screensaver, for educational
purposes, presentations, or to create coding demos.

 HOW WE PREPARE SHOPIFY FOR BFCM (2025) (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Shopify prepared for Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) from March to
October by running bimonthly "fire drills" that simulated 150% of the
previous year's peak traffic, conducting chaos engineering exercises
called "Game Days," and systematically identifying and fixing
infrastructure bottlenecks. Its preparation included capacity planning
across multiple cloud regions, load testing with its tool, "Genghis,"
and creating a "Resiliency Matrix" to document vulnerabilities and
response procedures. 

 IS AI CREATING A NEW CODE REVIEW BOTTLENECK FOR SENIOR ENGINEERS? (8
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The increasing use of AI for code generation is creating a bottleneck
in code review. Senior engineers are struggling to keep up. While AI
can quickly produce code, integrating it with existing systems,
ensuring security, and handling edge cases is still challenging.

 MUX (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Mux is a desktop application for parallel agentic development. 

 SUNSETTING SUPERMAVEN (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Supermaven, acquired a year ago, is being sunsetted with refunds
issued and free autocomplete inference provided for existing Neovim
and JetBrains users. 

 MCP APPS: EXTENDING SERVERS WITH INTERACTIVE USER INTERFACES (5
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The MCP Apps Extension is being proposed to standardize interactive
user interfaces for MCP servers, allowing them to deliver rich UI
experiences to hosts and enabling bidirectional communication. 

 "GOOD ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT" IS A FAD (12 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Engineering management trends are fleeting fads driven by business
realities rather than moral imperatives.
