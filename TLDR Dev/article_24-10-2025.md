 AI NATIVE DEVCON HITS BROOKLYN NOV 18-19 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most dev conferences are still pretending AI coding tools are a
novelty; most teams are already a few steps beyond.

AI Native DevCon [4] is the only conference built entirely around
spec-driven development and AI-native workflows. Instead of "intro to
agents" talks, you get:

 	* Workshops on building MCP servers, testing AI-generated code with
Cursor (taught by Cursor's Shrey Shah), and managing agent fleets.
 	* Guy Podjarny (Tessl) on scaling spec-driven dev
 	* An AI tools cage match.
 	* Additional talks by speakers from CrewAI, Snyk, Thoughtworks, and
others

ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 HACKING FORMULA 1: ACCESSING MAX VERSTAPPEN'S PASSPORT AND PII
THROUGH FIA BUGS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Devs discovered a vulnerability in the FIA Driver Categorisation
portal that allowed them to escalate their privileges to
administrator. This admin access granted them the ability to view
sensitive PII, including passports and resumes, of F1 drivers like Max
Verstappen. The vulnerability was reported to the FIA, which took the
site offline and implemented a fix. 

 4 UNCONVENTIONAL WAYS TO CAST IN TYPESCRIPT (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article goes over four unconventional methods to cast between
types in TypeScript, showing potential unsoundness in the language's
type system. These methods include abusing the `is` operator, using
mutation across boundaries, exploiting structural typing, and
manipulating `void` type combinations. While TypeScript generally
provides good type safety, these techniques can introduce subtle bugs
and unsafety. 

 HOW MEMORY MAPS (MMAP) DELIVER 25X FASTER FILE ACCESS IN GO (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Memory maps in Unix allow a file to be mapped into virtual memory,
enabling direct reads via pointers instead of slower seek/read
operations. Benchmarks in Go show memory maps can be up to 25 times
faster than using `ReaderAt` for random lookups and iterations. While
writing to memory maps is inefficient due to page faults, they can
still be great for read-heavy operations when files are cached.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 THE PRICE OF MANDATORY CODE REVIEWS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Based on data from 400+ companies and 3,000+ engineers, this article
challenges the mandatory code review practice in software development.
The research found that teams without code reviews are 1.9x more
productive but produce 2.4x more bugs, while high-quality reviews
(though 38% slower) reduce bugs by 61% compared to low-quality ones.
Top-performing teams (90th percentile) achieve both speed and quality
by being selective about when reviews are needed. 

 WHAT HAPPENED TO APPLE'S LEGENDARY ATTENTION TO DETAIL? (11 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Apple's attention to detail, a hallmark of the brand, has declined in
the last 8-10 years. This article points out inconsistent UI design
across apps, intrusive permission requests, and the buggy, visually
flawed "liquid glass" design as evidence of a decline in user
experience.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WEBINAR: AUTOMATE CHANGE MANAGEMENT WITH JIRA SERVICE MANAGEMENT AND
BITBUCKET (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Join this upcoming webinar on 10/29 [10] to learn how to overcome
common deployment challenges, improve visibility, and ultimately
deliver higher-quality releases more efficiently. This webinar will
cover Atlassian's unique approach to DevOps, practical implementation
tips, and ways to improve collaboration between Dev and Ops with total
traceability. Join live [10] 

 WORKFLOW (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Workflow is a beta TypeScript framework that simplifies building
durable and reliable asynchronous JavaScript applications and AI
agents. It allows devs to define workflows and steps with simple
directives, handling state management and retries automatically. The
framework has built-in observability with traces, logs, and metrics. 

 INTRODUCING PYTORCH MONARCH (17 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 PyTorch Monarch is a distributed programming framework that makes
cluster programming easier by treating resources as local, similar to
single-machine Python. Monarch organizes resources into meshes,
enabling operations on entire clusters with fault handling and
separation of control and data planes. It provides distributed tensors
that integrate with PyTorch, allowing operations across thousands of
GPUs. 

 WEB CODEGEN SCORER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Web Codegen Scorer is a tool developed by the Angular team at Google
for evaluating the quality of web code generated by LLMs. It focuses
on web code quality and allows users to compare models, iterate on
prompts, and monitor code quality over time using built-in checks like
build success, security, and coding best practices.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LIVING DANGEROUSLY WITH CLAUDE (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Running coding agents like Claude with unrestricted permissions comes
with increased productivity and the ability to outsource tasks, but
also makes Claude vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. The safest
thing to do is to sandbox coding agents, ideally on external systems
with controlled network access, to mitigate these risks. 

 PROGRAMMING WITH LESS THAN NOTHING (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 An interviewer asks a candidate to solve FizzBuzz, and the candidate
responds by attempting to implement the entire problem using
combinatory logic in JavaScript. The interviewer is initially
skeptical, recognizing the approach as an exercise in reinventing
programming primitives from lambda calculus. The candidate then
constructs numbers, lists, and string manipulation functions using
combinators, eventually producing the desired FizzBuzz output.

QUICK LINKS

 TYLER TRIES DTRACE (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This dev explored Node.js backpressure by modifying a Node.js build
to disable it, using DTrace to measure garbage collection times, and
found that disabling backpressure greatly increases garbage collection
effort. 

 WHEN YOU GET TO BE SMART WRITING A MACRO (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This dev improved their debugging tool, `hashp` (a better `println`),
to work seamlessly within Clojure's thread-first (`->`) and
thread-last (`->>`) macros by using a clever probe technique that
dynamically detects the macro's context. 

 WHY /DEV/NULL IS AN ACID COMPLIANT DATABASE (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Technically, `/dev/null` is an ACID-compliant database due to its
atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable behavior, despite offering 0
bytes of storage. 

 SURF (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Surf is an open-source, local-first AI notebook that helps users
research and synthesize information from various media types by
integrating files and web resources directly into a streamlined
workflow.
