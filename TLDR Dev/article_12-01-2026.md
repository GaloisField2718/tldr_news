ARTICLES & TUTORIALS

 STD::MOVE DOESN'T MOVE ANYTHING: A DEEP DIVE INTO VALUE CATEGORIES
(38 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 `std::move` in C++ is a misnamed function that doesn't physically
move data, but rather casts an expression into an rvalue reference,
signaling that its resources can be "pillaged." This conversion allows
move constructors and move assignment operators to efficiently
transfer ownership of resources, usually by swapping pointers, instead
of performing expensive deep copies. 

 WHAT HAPPENED TO WEBASSEMBLY (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 WebAssembly today is used in many real-world applications, powering
everything from game engines and image processing to secure plugin
ecosystems. It functions as an efficient, low-level compilation
target, allowing devs to bridge language gaps, integrate
high-performance code (like C++) into web environments, and run many
languages efficiently.

OPINIONS & ADVICE

 AI IS A BUSINESS MODEL STRESS TEST (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI is a business model stress test. Tailwind Labs was recently tested
as it laid off 75% of its engineering team because AI models reduced
traffic to its documentation, reducing sales. AI commoditizes anything
"specifiable," such as documentation or pre-built components, by
directly generating answers without referring users to original
sources. 

 START YOUR MEETINGS AT 5 MINUTES PAST (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Starting all meetings five minutes past the hour or half-hour
guarantees a short break between back-to-back meetings, which is more
effective than attempting to end early. The brief pause allows
attendees to transition, settle, and arrive less stressed. 

 DON'T FALL INTO THE ANTI-AI HYPE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI is permanently changing programming, making manual coding obsolete
for many tasks. LLMs are able to complete complex projects in hours
instead of weeks, showing their current power in areas like library
modification, bug fixing, and code generation. AI is a continuation of
code democratization, and devs need to embrace and adapt to these new
tools to multiply their capabilities.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FERRITE (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Ferrite is a fast, lightweight text editor built with Rust and egui.
It has WYSIWYG Markdown editing, tree viewers for structured data,
syntax highlighting, various view modes including split view and Zen
mode, and workspace capabilities. 

 CLAUDE SWITCHER (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 The Claude Code Switcher automates scripts using Claude Code. It
enables executable markdown files with shebang support, allowing AI
prompts to function as standard Unix-style scripts that can pipe data
and chain together.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW MARKDOWN TOOK OVER THE WORLD (24 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Markdown is a simple, plain text formatting system created by John
Gruber in 2004 to make writing for the web easier than using complex
HTML. It quickly became a fundamental tool used across nearly every
facet of the modern tech world. Despite its adoption and the immense
value it enables, Gruber freely shared Markdown, never seeking to
monetize his invention. 

 MAJOR SOFTWARE INCUMBENTS RESTRICT API ACCESS TO DEFEND AGAINST
AI-DRIVEN COMPETITION (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Salesforce, Datadog, and Epic are restricting API access to protect
market share as AI speeds up development. Slack now limits third-party
calls to one per minute.

QUICK LINKS

 THE SOFTWARE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A "software Cambrian explosion" will massively increase the amount of
software created, making skilled engineers necessary for managing,
scaling, and securing this new software. 

 CODE IS CLAY (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI's automation of commodity programming will allow software
engineers to focus on creative, "hypercube" ideas, transforming the
field into a more valued craft like post-industrial pottery. 

 CODE IS CHEAP NOW. SOFTWARE ISN'T (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While AI tools have made code generation cheap and enabled a wave of
disposable personal software, creating robust, maintainable, and
impactful software still requires human engineering expertise,
architectural judgment, and strategic problem-solving beyond just
writing code. 

 AI ZEALOTRY (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI development is a transformative and fun evolution, similar to the
advent of compilers, as it automates mundane tasks and allows devs to
focus on strategic thinking.
