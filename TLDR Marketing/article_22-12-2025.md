NEWS & TRENDS

 AGE GATING THE FUTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Age verification is becoming a strict requirement that changes how
people experience the internet and what they can access. Australia now
bans users under 16 from social media, and noncompliant platforms face
fines up to $49.5M. Users will encounter harder identity checks and
more friction, resulting in an internet where two people can have very
different experiences of the same product depending on where they
live, how old they are, and what their parents allow. The shift also
drives verifiable anonymity, so people can prove age through encrypted
systems while keeping personal identity private. 

 X SHARES MOST DISCUSSED TOPICS OF 2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This year's X conversations centered on entertainment and sports, not
politics. TV discussion was driven by Netflix hits Stranger Things and
Squid Game. Sports remained the largest category overall, led by the
Premier League. Cultural moments like the Met Gala also sparked
attention, showing X users engaging most around pop culture and sports
at scale.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 73% OF YOUR ECOMMERCE EMAILS ARE BROKEN (AND YOUR CUSTOMERS CAN'T
TELL YOU) (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most ecommerce emails are inaccessible to many shoppers. About 74% of
marketing emails have no discernible link text, which forces
screenreader users to guess and then leave. Accessibility also matters
to a wide audience because 46% of people have at least one disability
by age 60. Clear link text, short sentences, descriptive buttons,
structured headings, effective ALT text, and careful emoji use reduce
friction and can improve conversions. 

 HOW TO FIND THE PERFECT JOURNALIST FOR YOUR STORY (14 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Hyper-targeted outreach matters because most journalists do not
receive relevant pitches. Over 50% rarely get useful outreach, so
precise Google searches are needed to find the right authors. Strong
results depend on confirming topic fit, recent activity, content
format, and whether a journalist links to brands. Tools like ListIQ
can cut evaluation time from about 10 minutes per journalist to under
a minute.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 REACH REAL BUYERS IN TLDR INSTEAD OF FIGHTING FOR ATTENTION ON SOCIAL

 WIKIBOARD (TOOL) [10] 

 WikiBoard transforms Wikipedia browsing into an interactive,
mind-map-like experience. Users can see connections between articles
on a canvas, add notes, and explore topics like a connected web rather
than a linear tab structure. 

 HOW TO DIAGNOSE AND FIX GOOGLE MAPS RANKING DROPS (11 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Google Maps ranking drops are frequently linked to changes in SERP
layouts, profile visibility signals, or competitor improvements.
Businesses can use UTM parameters in GA4 and Search Console to isolate
GBP traffic and identify affected keywords. Rank tracking grids and
mobile SERP screenshots help determine if AI Overviews or ads have
pushed down organic placements. Visibility gaps are often caused by
outdated categories, low review activity, or pin locations falling
outside city boundaries. 

 YOUTUBE EXPANDS VOICE REPLIES, SUPERCHAT GOALS AND AI CREATION TOOLS
(7 MINUTE VIDEO) [12] 

 YouTube is opening access to voice replies to millions of creators.
The platform is also bringing the Create editing app to iOS and
expanding Superchat Goals to vertical livestreams. Channel Guidelines
are available to more channels, and new AI tools support image
creation, auto dubbing controls, Shorts clip suggestions, and comment
summaries. It is also testing changes to the Shorts dislike feature to
better match viewer behavior.

 GROWTH LESSONS BEHIND LOVABLE'S $6.6B VALUATION (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Lovable reached a $6.6B valuation in 13 months due to relentless
execution in a fast-growing AI category. It treats shipping velocity
as the top priority to stay ahead. Lovable builds in public to create
trust and turns community into a core growth engine as social becomes
more powerful than search. It also uses aggressive freemium to drive
usage and word of mouth. 

 GOOGLE'S AI USES SCHEMA? (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google Gemini may use structured data or hidden page content to
ground AI search answers, but this has not been proven yet. Tests
looked at 5 source pages and produced 101 content chunks. One sentence
matched content from schema data and possibly hidden content, which
raised questions about the true source. Clear proof of Gemini's scheme
use requires pages where schema text and page text differ, so experts
can see what it uses.
