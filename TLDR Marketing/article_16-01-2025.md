NEWS & TRENDS

 TIKTOK PREPARES TO SHUT DOWN APP IN US ON SUNDAY, SOURCES SAY (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 TikTok plans to close its app to US users on January 19. Users trying
to access the app will reportedly be directed to a site with
information about the ban and will have the option to download their
data so it isn't lost. This may be temporary. It'll be up to
President-elect Trump's Justice Department to enforce the law after he
takes office on January 20. 

 SNAPCHAT LURES IN CREATORS IN NEW AD CAMPAIGN AMID TIKTOK DRAMA (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Snapchat's new campaign emphasizes its role as a creator-friendly
platform, highlighting its 15 billion daily interactions. As TikTok
faces a potential U.S. ban, Snap promotes its tools, including account
toggling, pinned content, and Spotlight ads, to attract creators who
may be looking for alternatives. The platform saw a 50% year-over-year
increase in creator activity and now boasts over 500 million active
users.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT IS NEEDS-BASED SEGMENTATION? (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Needs-based segmentation divides audiences by their core desires and
problems rather than broad criteria like age or location, making ads
more relevant. Examples in the article include Target's
sensory-friendly clothing line and Fenty Beauty's inclusive makeup
range, which tailored products to very specific consumer needs. This
approach strengthens customer loyalty and drives higher marketing ROI
via better targeting. 

 IS YOUR RETENTION "TOO GOOD”? (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In B2C subscription businesses, high retention rates can signal
over-targeting core personas and missing growth opportunities.
Accepting some early churn allows experimentation with broader
audiences, increasing long-term revenue potential. The goal is to
elevate the cohort floor - where churn stabilizes - by retaining
customers after the initial drop-off. For example, Hulu raised its
floor from 20% to 30%, which boosted its profitability. Retention
strategies differ by churn timing. Early churn often points to
onboarding issues, while later churn may require solving
product-related problems like content gaps. 

 THE ANATOMY OF A BREAKTHROUGH “SERVICE-AS-A-SOFTWARE” BUSINESS (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Chargeflow's growth is driven by its “Service-as-a-Software”
model. It offers automated chargeback recovery with success-based
pricing that eliminates upfront costs and commitments. The platform's
seamless onboarding and strategic placement in Shopify and Stripe
marketplaces promoted signups, while success reminders and a focus on
merchant value drove retention. Chargeflow created a scalable,
customer-centric solution that is attractive to merchants by blending
AI automation with thoughtful GTM strategies.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 PUNCHY MESSAGING TEMPLATE (GOOGLE SHEET) [9] 

 This template, inspired by the book “Make It Punchy,” offers a
structured approach to crafting product messaging. It guides users
through brainstorming themes based on customer pains, desires, and
qualities, developing value propositions, detailing benefits,
enhancing clarity and impact, and transforming ideas into engaging
stories. Featuring formulas and functions, the template is versatile
for individual or team use.

 LottieFiles simplifies the creation and use of lightweight Lottie
animations for apps and websites. It has a library of customizable
animations, editor tools, and integrations for platforms like React
and Flutter. Lottie animations, being lightweight, scalable, and
resolution-independent, enhance visuals with small file sizes and
smooth performance. The tool streamlines workflows for designers and
developers, making the process of integrating interactive visuals more
efficient.

 THE GOAL GAP: HOW THE CLASH BETWEEN BUSINESS AND CUSTOMER GOALS KILLS
BRANDS (AND HOW TO AVOID IT) (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ABM won British Rail's business by highlighting its disconnect from
customers, staging a pitch that simulated poor customer experiences.
This gap between the company's internal goals and customer
expectations caused declining passenger numbers, as ads failed to
align with real experiences. Similarly, Domino's Pizza lost customers
by prioritizing cost-cutting over product quality but regained market
share with a bold campaign addressing customer concerns and improving
its pizza. The "Goal Gap" occurs when businesses focus on themselves
rather than solving customers' problems, leading to lost trust and
disengagement. Successful marketing prioritizes customer needs and
positions the brand as a solution, reflected in all customer
interactions. 

 ADVERTISING IN THE AGE OF ATOMISED FAME (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Media fragmentation has made it tough for stars like Zendaya and Paul
Mescal to gain cross-generational fame. Algorithms are prioritizing
personalized content over universal appeal. Experts argue that brands
need to pivot from big campaigns to smaller, coordinated efforts
across channels that collectively leave a lasting impression. While TV
used to dominate brand building, its influence is waning, and
marketers must rely on AI to navigate the complexity of modern
strategies.
