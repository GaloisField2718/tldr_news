 GOOGLE SAYS IT'S STILL FIGURING OUT HOW A COOKIE OPT-IN MODEL WILL
WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google is still figuring out its cookie opt-in model, with few
details available so far. Google's Privacy Sandbox product manager,
Alex Cone, has clarified that the deprecation of third-party cookies
and the Privacy Sandbox are not inherently linked. The most pressing
question is whether the new opt-in model will resemble Apple's ATT
framework, which essentially rendered Apple's mobile ad ID obsolete
for targeted advertising.

 REIMAGINING CHECKOUT: THE FUTURE IS CHECK-IN (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Unexpected fees, sign-in requirements, and payment issues contribute
to 70% of shoppers abandoning their carts. Brands can address these
issues by providing upfront shipping fees, providing guest check-in
options, and offering multiple payment methods. Enhancing checkout
involves recognizing customers early, personalizing the shopping
experience, and simplifying the buying process with features like
one-click checkout. 

 3 DEAD-SIMPLE STEPS TO EDIT YOUR WRITING IN 10 MINUTES OR LESS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Over-editing is procrastination disguised as productivity. Instead,
wait 24 hours between writing and editing, which gives you fresh eyes.
Next, read everything you wrote out loud to identify poor sentence
structure and unnecessary jargon. Finally, read your writing on a
mobile screen, which helps you identify areas to improve formatting
and skimmability.

 RANKED #2 ON AMAZON FOR "GROWTH MARKETING" (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Koby Conrad's book, Channels of Growth, achieved the #2 ranking on
Amazon for "Growth Marketing" with just 18 reviews and a 4.8-star
rating. Despite competing against established books like Hacking
Growth, the combination of a high average rating, a recent spike in
sales, and optimized keywords helped the book surpass more popular
titles. This case demonstrates the power of targeting a specific niche
and maintaining high customer satisfaction in driving success. 

 EUROPE IS IN DANGER OF REGULATING ITS TECH MARKET OUT OF EXISTENCE (5
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Europe's strict tech regulations are causing global firms to withdraw
their products and services. Apple's new AI-powered features,
including Apple Intelligence, won't be released due to the EU's
Digital Markets Act. This isn't new - tech companies have previously
exited or limited services, like Meta in Canada and Google News in
Spain. Europe's regulatory stance might lead to an outdated tech
market.
