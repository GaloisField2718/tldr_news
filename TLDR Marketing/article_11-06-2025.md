 THE ‘ATTENTION EQUATION': WINNING THE RIGHT BATTLES FOR CONSUMER
ATTENTION (17 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Media consumption time has grown slowly over the past decade while
the volume of available content has exploded, fragmenting consumer
attention. As users toggle between platforms, devices, and formats,
the traditional focus on total time spent or audience size fails to
capture what truly drives monetization. Commercial factors like
platform scale, pricing, and distribution explain some of the variance
in revenue, but a significant portion depends on how engaged the
audience is and why they are consuming the content. Formats that
encourage focused and purposeful engagement, such as books, live
events, and gaming, consistently outperform low-focus formats like
social video or background audio. 

 NEWS SITES ARE GETTING CRUSHED BY GOOGLE'S NEW AI TOOLS (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Google's new AI tools are slashing traffic to news sites by replacing
traditional search with chatbot answers. HuffPost and Business Insider
have seen search traffic drop by over 50% in the past 3 years. The New
York Times fell from 44% to 36.5%. In response, outlets such as The
Atlantic and Washington Post are focusing on subscriptions, live
events, and stronger reader relationships. Many were already battling
low public trust and rising competition. Now they also face the
challenge of protecting their content from being used to train AI
without permission.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHEN TO USE VOUCHERS VS FREE GIFTS FOR PROMOTIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Offering low-value items as vouchers instead of direct gifts
increases purchase likelihood. In experiments, vouchers for small
gifts raised sales by up to 52.4%, while direct delivery of high-value
gifts increased purchase intent by as much as 19.3%. The reason is
that vouchers reduce the customer's focus on the gift's value relative
to the main product. To optimize results, use vouchers for low-value
gifts and give high-value gifts directly. 

 ENTERPRISE CONTENT THAT CREATES VALUE, NOT NOISE (34 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Even top-performing enterprise content teams often work with
incomplete attribution and rely on directional signals to assess
performance. Rather than chasing perfect data, the most effective
teams embed themselves within demand generation and product marketing
functions to share accountability for pipeline and revenue. This
approach transforms content from a brand support function into a core
growth engine. Clear ownership over messaging, performance metrics,
and campaign alignment ensures that every asset produced contributes
to business outcomes rather than just filling a calendar.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW YOUR MARKETING TEAM CAN ADOPT AI IN ONE DAY (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Marketing AI hackathons help teams quickly adopt AI through hands-on
experimentation. The format involves setting a date, defining
constraints, choosing a few tools, brainstorming ideas, building
simple projects in a day, and sharing demos the next day. Tools like
ChatGPT, Clay, Figma Make, Lovable, and Replit make it easy to build
workflows, design assets, or internal utilities without heavy coding.
During its internal hackathon, MKT1 built several practical tools in
under an hour each, including a public hackathon idea generator using
Lovable, a UTM link builder in Replit, and a screenshot formatter in
Figma Make.

 AI'S METRICS QUESTION (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Metrics evolve as platforms mature, from hits and registered users to
more meaningful measures like daily active users and time spent. With
AI, there's still little agreement on what counts as meaningful use,
whether it's casual prompts, enterprise adoption, or token counts that
vary by context. Companies like Google track detailed behavioral
signals, but AI products don't have clear equivalents yet. Comparisons
to smartphones or the early internet lack context since AI is more
accessible and built on existing infrastructure. For now, measuring
AI's true impact remains unclear. 

 INSURGENT BRANDS STEAL THE SPOTLIGHT IN 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Bain & Company's report spotlights 120 insurgent brands in the US
consumer goods sector that drove 39% of the category's incremental
growth. These high-growth brands include newcomers like Goodles and
veterans like Chobani and Celsius. Defined by rapid growth and
independence, insurgents are reshaping categories like food,
beverages, and personal care by meeting unmet needs with founder-led
authenticity and a disciplined playbook. With more incumbents seeking
volume-led growth and improved capital conditions, M&A interest in
insurgents is rising. 

 JEWELLERY FINDS A NEW AUDIENCE IN BRITISH MEN (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Jewellery is catching on with British men, especially younger ones.
More men are buying jewellery for themselves and doing it on their own
terms. In the past year, 17% bought it for themselves. Among Gen Z,
that rose to 24%. Necklaces or chains were most popular at 33%,
followed by watches at 32%. Nearly half of buyers, 47%, shopped mostly
or entirely online. Price and discounts influenced 39%, far more than
online ads or celebrity endorsements. Independent jewellers led at
39%, ahead of marketplaces at 30% and high street stores at 27%.
