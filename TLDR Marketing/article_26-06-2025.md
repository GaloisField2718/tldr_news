 FROM DEMOS TO DEALS: INSIGHTS FOR BUILDING IN ENTERPRISE AI (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Flashy AI demos are easy to make. Building reliable enterprise AI

user behavior, and evolving models. AI startups are growing rapidly
thanks to strong demand, bigger budgets, and faster sales cycles.

apps. To sustain success, companies focus on building lasting moats by
becoming core systems of record, deeply integrating into workflows,
and fostering trusted customer relationships. Speed and momentum

 GODADDY AT CANNES LIONS: POSSIBLY THE BEST B2B CUSTOMER CASE STUDY
YOU'LL EVER SEE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 GoDaddy's Goggins Goggles campaign won the Cannes Lions 2025 Creative
B2B Grand Prix by combining celebrity influence, humor, and real
business results. Actor Walton Goggins launched a real eyewear line
using GoDaddy Airo, timed with his casting in The White Lotus Season 3
and culminating in a Super Bowl ad. The campaign ran for nearly a year
and earned praise for boldness, timing, and authenticity. Marketers
should study it as a model for integrating cultural relevance with
measurable B2B impact. 

 HOW LOW-COST VIDEO ADS FROM A POLISH FIRE STATION SPARKED SALES IN
GERMANY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mirjan24 used in-house video production to grow brand awareness in
Germany, increasing its monthly turnover from 1 million to 5-6 million
euros. The ads apply YouTube's ABCD principles to grab attention in
the first six seconds, optimize for logo visibility, and use
voiceovers to enhance storytelling. Viewers of its ads were over 10
times more likely to search for the brand, and brand perception was
2.5 times higher among those who saw the videos. The company has now
invested in a dedicated video studio within its new logistics center
to continue scaling this strategy.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO CREATE A MILLION DOLLAR LANDING PAGE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This landing page strategy is built around impact, trust, empathy,
pain, authority, and action. Impact means clearly stating what you do,
who it's for, and the outcome, supported by a strong visual. Trust is
earned through testimonials, client logos, press mentions, and
performance data across the page. Empathy connects with your audience
by reflecting their challenges in honest, relatable language. Pain
highlights what they risk by not solving the problem. Authority shows
why you're the right choice, using past results and relevant success
stories. Action drives conversion with a clear next step and a
reminder of what's lost by waiting. 

 “MARKETING SPEAK” TO THE BOARD ROOM (GOOGLE SHEET) [9] 

 This guide translates marketing jargon into language that resonates
with executives and board members. It highlights common phrases
marketers use that often fall flat with leadership and offers better
alternatives paired with relevant metrics to demonstrate impact. The
goal is to shift conversations from vague marketing terms to concrete
outcomes like revenue efficiency and sales-ready leads.

 PLEASE DON'T START A PODCAST (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Starting a podcast requires careful planning and commitment, which
many organizations overlook. Challenges include defining clear goals,
securing a steady flow of engaging guests, maintaining consistent
episode releases, hosting effectively, and standing out in a crowded
market. Podcasts are a heavy lift. Instead, becoming a guest on
established podcasts offers similar benefits with less work. It allows
thought leaders to build credibility, reach target audiences more
easily, and repurpose content across channels without the pressures of
producing an entire show. 

 WHAT I LEARNED AFTER HANDING MARKETING TO A GEN ZER (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Gen Z marketing requires a shift from polished messaging to raw,
relatable content that sparks instant emotional recognition.
Traditional formats focused on pain points and structure no longer
resonate. Instead, meme-driven, user-generated, and TikTok-style
content leads. Gen Z rejects inauthenticity and embraces fast-moving
microtrends that feel culturally relevant. One company increased its
return on ad spend from 30% to 120% by letting a Gen Z marketer lead
content strategy. 

 RACHEL KARTEN AND THE CASE FOR CONSISTENCY (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Rachel Karten shares how the early internet shaped her creativity and
launched her career in social strategy. From LiveJournal to Tumblr to
her popular newsletter “Link in Bio”, she has built a reputation
for experience-driven insights. Writing has made her a better
strategist. Rather than chasing virality, she now focuses on
consistent, meaningful brand strategies that build trust and evolve
over time. She believes this steady approach leads to deeper
engagement, rather than short-lived spikes in visibility.
