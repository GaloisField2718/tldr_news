 Chinese officials have declared that they vehemently oppose the

 AI IS ABOUT TO MAKE APP SUBSCRIPTION FATIGUE EVEN WORSE (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Consumers now have subscriptions for everything ‚Äî streaming

boom to push consumers toward pricier subscriptions. They're also
using consumers' data to help train various gen AI tools, meaning the
consumers are effectively paying for these tools twice.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 IS OPTIMIZING FOR ONE SPECIFIC KEYWORD AN OUTDATED SEO PRACTICE? (9
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are scenarios where a narrow keyword focus works and others
where a broader topic-based SEO strategy makes more sense. Optimizing
for one specific keyword is a bad idea when it's seen as the single
key to SEO success or if the goal keyword doesn't match search intent.
In general, it's better to target multiple keywords relevant to your
core service offering to maximize qualified traffic. Specific keyword
optimization does make sense when it's about a niche or single topic
or when you know that ranking for a single keyword will provide
significant ROI. 

 IT'S NOT ABOUT BENEFITS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most marketing guides will tell you ‚Äúsell benefits, not
features.‚Äù It's the reason why ‚Äú1,000 songs in your pocket‚Äù is
an iconic slogan for the iPod. However, to make a marketing campaign
even better, go a layer deeper and ask yourself why people want this
benefit. For an iPod, the answer could be to get through their commute
or to motivate them during their workout. Show these experiences in
your campaign to help consumers connect to it. Apple's modern-day
advertising for AirPods leans into this strategy.

 THE QUICK WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE REALLY SELLING (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 People don't buy what you do ‚Äî they buy what you do for them.
However, most brands never quite manage to separate these two things.
There are 4 different buckets of value a business can really offer:
serving a particular group, serving a particular need, below the
status quo, and above the status quo. Brainstorm ways your brand
offers value in each of these buckets, then identify which feel the
most true, unique, or exciting. 

 HOW TO PRIORITIZE GROWTH LEVERS? (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article discusses the drawbacks of conventional growth
prioritization frameworks such as Impact + Confidence + Ease (ICE) or
Potential + Importance + Ease (PIE). These frames tend to prioritize
quick wins over larger strategic projects, which can be detrimental in
the long run. Simplify the framework and focus only on business impact
and implementation effort. By creating a 2x2 matrix with the 2
factors, growth initiatives can be categorized in 4 boxes: 'Big Bets',
'No Brainers', 'Quick Wins', and 'To consider but not prio'. 

 THE MARKET-BASED ASSETS THEORY OF BRAND COMPETITION (36 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 This report outlines the dominant 'Segmentation, Targeting,
Positioning' (STP) theory of brand competitiveness. It shows how STP
theory does not predict or fit with the empirical laws that describe
how brands compete, grow, and decline. The report presents evidence
that covers many countries and a number of product/service categories
which supports a market-based asset theory of brand competitiveness.
This theory and evidence provides an explanation of why some brands
are bigger than others.
