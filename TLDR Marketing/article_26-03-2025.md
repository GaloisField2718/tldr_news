 NAPSTER TO BECOME A MUSIC-MARKETING METAVERSE FIRM AFTER $207M
ACQUISITION (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Infinite Reality is acquiring Napster for $207 million to transform
it into a social music platform focused on fan engagement and

high-fidelity tracks and operates as a legal streaming service, will
introduce virtual concerts, social listening parties, and gamified
experiences. Infinite plans to let musicians sell tickets,
merchandise, and digital content while using AI for customer service

Infinite aims to leverage Web3 and AI to revitalize the brand in the
metaverse.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY YOU NEED TO SHOW UNENGAGED SUBSCRIBERS THE DOOR (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Inactive subscribers drag down sender reputation and reduce inbox
placement, hurting even high-performing campaigns. Email engagement is
a key deliverability factor, and maintaining a lean, responsive list
leads to stronger performance. The recommendation is to re-engage or
remove dormant contacts to preserve data quality, cut platform costs,
and ensure reliable performance tracking. 

 HUMANIZE YOUR AI TO REDUCE FRAUD (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Companies can reduce fraud in AI chatbots by humanizing them. This
can be done by giving the chatbots human-like names, avatars, or
tones, or by informing users that a human monitors the AI. Users are
34.7% more likely to act unethically and 10.6% more likely to give
false reasons for returns when interacting with AI compared to humans,
but human-like chatbots reduce unethical behavior by 18.5%. Guilt
prevents unethical actions, and human-like features create an
emotional connection that discourages unethical behavior. For critical
tasks, notify users that a human will take over to further reduce
fraud. 

 A BETTER ONBOARDING FLOW (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Excalidraw grew to 850,000 monthly active users and 89,000 GitHub
stars by eliminating traditional onboarding. Users land directly in
the fully functional product with no signup, tutorials, or friction.
Its simplified toolset and intuitive design make it easy for users to
feel competent immediately. The intentionally imperfect, hand-drawn
aesthetic encourages faster ideation, easier sharing, and creates
instant brand recognition, driving organic growth.

 DOES AUTOMATED LEAD NURTURING REALLY WORK? A NEW STUDY CHALLENGES THE
HYPE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Automated Lead Nurturing (ALN) boosts conversions by up to 23
percentage points, but it only works well for new leads, short sales
cycles, and low-value deals. ALN performs poorly in complex B2B sales
or high-ticket transactions, where buyers rely more on research and
personal interaction. Its value lies in accelerating qualified sales
interactions, not in passive engagement, therefore measuring open
rates or clicks may be misleading to evaluate its performance.
