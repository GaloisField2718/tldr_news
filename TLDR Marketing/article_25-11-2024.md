influencers has dwindled, with only 2.2% of Americans trusting them
for purchase advice. User reviews hold more credibility (over 30%).

focus on high-quality, engaging content. 86% of companies are expected
to use creator marketing by 2025.

 HOW I USED 'PRAISE-LED MARKETING' TO GO VIRAL (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 To leverage praise-led marketing, celebrate industry leaders and
emerging voices with genuine, research-backed praise on a
well-designed platform. Reach out personally to nominees, ensure
transparent criteria, and create shareable content like blog posts or

and balance established and rising figures to build trust. Add
creative touches, like branded visuals or personalized gestures, to
increase engagement.

 GETTING STARTED WITH AI: GOOD ENOUGH PROMPTING (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI often stumbles in real-world applications when users struggle with
prompting or misuse it as a search engine. A practical approach is to
treat AI as a patient, forgetful coworker, exploring tasks within your
expertise. Key tactics for using AI include giving clear instructions,
using step-by-step prompts, providing full context, and leveraging
AI's infinite patience for iteration. Spending 10 focused hours with
AI can help develop intuition and integrate it effectively into work
and life.

 MARKETING HAS A MARKETING PROBLEM - AND IT'S HURTING LONG-TERM
BUSINESS HEALTH (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The influence of CMOs is diminishing as they are increasingly
positioned below the C-suite, which limits their ability to shape
business strategy. Fragmented marketing functions further hinder the
connection between customer insights and growth. CEOs who prioritize
marketing in growth strategies are twice as likely to achieve over 5%
annual growth. Despite this, only 24% of CMOs are classified as
"Unifiers," who collaborate effectively with the C-suite.
