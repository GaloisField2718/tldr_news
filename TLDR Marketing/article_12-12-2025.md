NEWS & TRENDS

 AI'S STRUCTURAL CHANGE IS THE ONSET OF THE VIBE ERA (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 AI is reshaping work from the bottom up, creating a widening gap
between how individuals use AI and how organizations plan for it.
Between 23% and 58% of employees bring their own AI to work, and 54%
would use it without support, so informal usage is already shaping
workflows and outputs. This shift makes judgment more important than
skill and increases the cost of quality control as output rises and
time spent falls. Marketers should treat emerging ‘vibes' as early
signals of structural instability and prepare for new forms of debt
created by AI-generated work that looks right, but is not actually
right. 

 TEENS, SOCIAL MEDIA AND AI CHATBOTS 2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 About 20% of US teens say they are on TikTok or YouTube almost
constantly. 64% use AI chatbots, including roughly 30% daily. YouTube
reaches nearly all teens, with TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat also
widely used, though Facebook and X have declined. ChatGPT is the most
popular chatbot at 59%, more than twice the use of the next most
common options. Older teens, Black and Hispanic teens, and those in
higher-income households report higher usage of both social media and
AI chatbots. 

 ONE THIRD OF PODCAST CREATORS QUIT AS VIDEO DEMANDS CLASH WITH AUDIO
HABITS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 1 in 3 podcast creators are quitting as video production demands
outpace what many can sustain, driving a 32% churn rate even though
getting started is easier than ever. Many who leave prefer audio-first
consumption while feeling pressured to produce video, which raises
workload and accelerates burnout. At the same time, video adoption
keeps climbing, with 71% of active creators using it. Younger and
multicultural creators are fueling most of the growth. The tension
between rapid video expansion and strong audio habits is reshaping who
stays, who leaves, and where platforms need to focus to keep creators
engaged.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW AIRBNB 2X'D REVENUE IN 1 WEEK (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Airbnb doubled its revenue in one week by replacing low-quality host
photos with high-quality images that reduced uncertainty and increased
trust. The founders photographed 24 listings themselves, which sparked
a program that later used 2,000 photographers to shoot 35,000 listings
across 5,000 cities. Listings with professional photos earned 2.5×
more bookings and $1,025 more per month. The strategy worked because
it solved a major trust gap in an experiential marketplace and showed
that hands-on, unscalable work can reveal root problems that code
alone cannot fix.

 WHY YOU NEED TO USE CAC FOR SEO (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Customer acquisition cost is rarely applied to SEO due to complex
attribution and delayed results. This article shows a way to calculate
SEO CAC using only direct costs such as content production,
link-building campaigns, tools, and consultants. It uses first-touch
attribution to connect organic search to conversions. Early CAC
figures are typically high but decrease over time as content continues
to generate conversions without additional spend. The model shows that
SEO can achieve a lower CAC than paid channels if investment continues
over multiple periods.
