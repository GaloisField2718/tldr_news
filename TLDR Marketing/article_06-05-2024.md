NEWS & TRENDS

 GEN Z MOSTLY DOESN'T CARE IF INFLUENCERS ARE ACTUAL HUMANS, NEW STUDY
SHOWS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Gen Z's perception of influencers is evolving, as shown by a recent
study indicating their willingness to engage with AI-generated
influencers. Despite concerns over authenticity, with 37% expressing
distrust towards brands working with AI, 46% of Gen Z respondents are
intrigued by such collaborations. They prioritize metrics like
follower count over traditional authenticity markers. 

 GOOGLE EXPANDS PERFORMANCE MAX TO ONLINE MARKETPLACES (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Google's new Performance Max for Marketplaces allows sellers to
create Google ad campaigns that send traffic to their product listings
on third-party e-commerce platforms without needing a website or
Merchant Center account. After connecting their Google Ads account to
a supported marketplace, like Amazon, brands can use existing
marketplace product data (i.e. images and pricing) in ads and will get
detailed reporting on campaign performance within Google Ads.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SCREENSHOT MARKETING = THE ULTIMATE CURIOSITY HOOK (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Private chats (i.e. iMessage/Whatsapp screenshots) are a type of
graphic that immediately makes people stop scrolling their feeds.
People are naturally nosy, so this type of image will pique their
interest. Brands can use genuine screenshots or even stage one for
marketing purposes. Behind-the-scenes employee discussions about an
upcoming product launch, happy customers talking to CSMs, or FAQs in
chat form are all ways to employ this tactic. 

 HOW I ORGANICALLY SOURCED 60% OF CUSTOMERS FROM LINKEDIN (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 LinkedIn posts that contain images outperform those without by
50-60%. Don't just tell people you're hiring, having a sale, or just
launching a new feature - show them through visuals and colors.
LinkedIn users also love a good emoji list, and much like any other
social media platform, a controversial thought or opinion always draws
attention. If there's a status quo in your industry, a behavior that
everyone exhibits, or a trend that the majority of your competition
sheepishly follows ‚Äî go against it. 

 GTM STRATEGY VS. LAUNCH STRATEGY (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A launch strategy is short-term (1 week - 1 month), while a GTM
strategy is long-term (6 - 12 months). Launching a product focuses on
creating awareness and guiding people through the entire customer
journey. It requires specific segmentation, personalized messaging,
and a killer experience from start to finish. A GTM strategy is based
on insights gained after the initial launch. It should be flexible and
reflective of the product's success, particularly regarding achieving
PMF. If the initial launch fails due to a lack of product stickiness,
all marketing efforts should be paused until the product's issues are
addressed.

MISCELLANEOUS

 IT'S ALL ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL: A BLUNDER MANY COPYWRITERS AND
MARKETERS MAKE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A common blunder made by copywriters and marketers is to speak to a
group when one person is the audience. Teams do not read sales letters
or website pages ‚Äî individuals do. Sales are made (and lost) one by
one. Copy should speak to one person whenever possible, avoiding
language like ‚Äúsome of you‚Äù or ‚Äúpeople just like you.‚Äù
Speaking insider-to-insider strengthens the copy as it shows that you
are one of them. No matter how educated your audience, make your
message easy to consume. 

 SAYING IT RIGHT, AND SAYING IT BEST (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 When every brand is vying to be the one that says it loudest, be the
one that says it best. Tone and messaging add a lot of nuance to
creative, but too many brands generate content without considering the
writing. To get messaging right, brands should start by researching
their audience, their market, and what they (realistically) offer.
Next, develop a persona for the brand that will anchor everything you
write. Avoid writing copy to simply sound like your audience ‚Äî it's
better to sound like your brand. 

 IS PINTEREST THE GOLDEN RETRIEVER OF SOCIAL MEDIA? (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Pinterest stands apart in today's social media landscape as a refuge
from drama and opinion overload. It offers a serene haven focused on
self-care and positivity. Studies have shown its positive impact on
reducing stress and burnout. Users appreciate its inward-facing
nature, devoid of vanity metrics and negative discourse. Pinterest's
algorithm prioritizes saved content, providing a relaxed browsing
experience. It doesn't reward a ‚Äúmore is more‚Äù mentality, and
creators feel less pressure to constantly update their audiences in
real time.
