NEWS & TRENDS

 AIRBNB'S NEW ‚ÄòICONS' FEATURE MAY REDEFINE TRAVEL EXPERIENCES (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Airbnb's latest initiative, ‚ÄúIcons‚Äù, features a series of unique
experiences curated in collaboration with notable figures from music,
film, art, and sports. For example, guests could enjoy an evening at a
secret speakeasy designed by comedian Kevin Hart. The program launches
with 11 such experiences, each accessible through a digital lottery
system. Most of these experiences are offered for free or at a nominal
cost of less than $100. In 2024, over 4,000 digital golden tickets
will be used. Airbnb is potentially setting a new trend in how tech
platforms can bridge the gap between digital interaction and
real-world experiences.

DISCOVERY (2 MINUTE READ) [6]

increasingly powerful role in the product discovery process for
consumers. 61% of the app's users discover new brands and products on

 THE 4-STEP FORMATTING FRAMEWORK TO 10X YOUR WRITING (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Good formatting makes your writing easier to read, skim, and share.
Start every section with a single sentence opener, which keeps readers
interested and encourages them to continue. Wherever possible, convert
long paragraphs into bulleted lists. Use bolded subheads to break up
the page and help the reader identify where they're going. Use the
1/3/1 writing rhythm, which entails intentionally alternating the
length of sentences. 

 YOUR 14-DAY FREE TRIAL AIN'T GONNA CUT IT (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article delves into the pitfalls of relying on a 14-day free
trial period, highlighting the discrepancy between customer onboarding
time and the trial duration. Keygen, a software licensing and
distribution API, adopted an unlimited trial to better align with its
median time-to-convert of 41 days, resulting in increased overall
sign-ups and improved conversion rates. 

 A SHORT REMINDER OF OATLY'S REBRAND (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most people don't know Oatly started in the 90's. With flat growth,
the board shook things up by hiring a CEO outside of the food
industry. The marketing department was replaced with a creative team
that was involved in every business division and decision. Instead of
using paid media to drive the brand's quirky messaging, the company
made every square inch of the product packaging work harder. It lived
and breathed the phrase ‚Äúbe human and not a logo‚Äù. The company
gave a voice to the real people behind the brand.
