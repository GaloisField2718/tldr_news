 ACCESS ARCHIVED WEBPAGES DIRECTLY THROUGH GOOGLE SEARCH (2 MINUTE

 THE EGG THEORY, APPLIED (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Egg Theory explains why cake mixes sold more once they started
requiring an egg ‚Äì it made people feel like they were contributing,
so it was no longer "too easy." Studies have found that people are
willing to pay more for furniture they assemble themselves (‚Äúthe
IKEA effect‚Äù). The Egg Theory and the IKEA effect can teach us a lot
about which AI products will prevail ‚Äì these applications shouldn't
completely remove the human from the process, as humans like to feel a
level of control. For example, the ‚ÄúSmart Reply‚Äù feature included
in Apple Intelligence requires the user to answer several prompts,
which strikes an appropriate balance between convenience and effort.

engagement across digital platforms. They have ensured Chili's stays

consistent, witty presence in community engagement.
