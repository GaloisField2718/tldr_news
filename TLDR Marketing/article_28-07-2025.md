NEWS & TRENDS

 MARKETING CONCERNS OVER AI SEARCH MAY BE OVERBLOWN, STUDY FINDS (10
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most marketers are not seeing major traffic losses from AI Overviews,
with 55.5% reporting traffic increases and only 8.3% seeing declines.
Many have already adapted, with 57% modifying SEO or content
strategies, and 54.5% diversifying channels like email and paid
social. 68% of marketers focus on tracking AI search visibility in
ChatGPT rather than Google's AI Overviews due to its clearer referral
data. Brand mentions and technical strategies like schema markup,
E-E-A-T, and clear content formatting are now central to visibility. 

 SOCIAL MEDIA CAPTURES MAJORITY OF DIGITAL ATTENTION AS VIDEO OUTPACES
TV (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Internet users now spend 13 hours and 48 minutes per week on social
media, 35% more than time spent watching TV. Short-form video leads
the way, accounting for 6 hours and 42 minutes weekly, surpassing both
long-form video and traditional television. Among women aged 16-24,
social media usage is 2.6X higher than TV viewing. YouTube tops mobile
app usage and web traffic, while 22.3% of adults globally report using
ChatGPT, with adoption reaching over 40% in countries like Kenya and
Israel.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO MAKE COMPETITORS LOOK LIKE ALIENS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The best companies avoid direct feature comparisons with competitors
and instead reframe the conversation by positioning themselves as
solving entirely different problems. Asana, Superhuman, and ClickUp
use analogies that place competitors in narrow roles while casting
themselves as broader solutions. Good messaging defines competitors in
small, accurate terms and presents the company as a more expansive,
transformational option. Use templates like Tool vs. Platform or Past
vs. Future to build this positioning. 

 SHOULD MY COMPANY INVEST IN A REDDIT STRATEGY? (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Reddit is more than an SEO tool. It's a major data source for LLMs,
meaning authentic content can shape how AI platforms understand and
present your brand. Unlike paid ads, Reddit relies on genuine
community engagement. Effective use means listening first,
contributing meaningfully, tracking mentions, and avoiding shortcuts.
Companies should join existing conversations rather than starting new
subreddits and ensure someone on the team can engage authentically.

 FREE INTERNAL AI PLAYBOOKS (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A list of 8 AI playbooks from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. 

 BOTCHED UNSUBSCRIBES HARM EMAIL DELIVERY (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Webmail providers sort and block emails based on signals like how
businesses honor unsubscribe requests. If a company uses the same
sending address for multiple lists and removes a user from only one
list, providers like Gmail may see this as ignoring an unsubscribe.
This can lower sender reputation and push emails to spam. Using
separate sending addresses, including unsubscribe headers with list
identifiers, and monitoring Gmail's Postmaster Tools, can help
preserve deliverability and trust.

 HOW A SIMPLE SPREADSHEET BECAME A COMMUNITY-LED GROWTH ENGINE: THE
NOMADS.COM STORY (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Nomads.com began as a simple spreadsheet Pieter Levels made to solve
his own travel challenges as a remote worker. It quickly evolved into
a global hub because it addressed a real, shared need. Growth happened
naturally as users found value and contributed their own data. Its
success came from usefulness, timing, and listening to users. 

 DEAR MARKETERS, HOW HAS THE PRODUCT LAUNCH PLAYBOOK CHANGED? (15
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Marketers should stop treating every product release as a standalone
event and instead prioritize based on audience impact. Launches should
fit into a broader narrative, align with company positioning, and be
bundled with other updates when appropriate. Rather than relying
solely on press, teams should activate creators, partners, and
customers early to build momentum. A checklist is not a strategy. Each
launch should begin with a clear brief defining goals, audience, and
channels. Strong internal alignment across product, marketing, and
sales is key to validating the feature and setting shared metrics.
