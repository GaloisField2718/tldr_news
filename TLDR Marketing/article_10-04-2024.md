 NO NEED TO WORRY THAT AI WILL RUIN TRAVEL‚ÄîSOCIAL MEDIA ALREADY DID
THAT (3 MINUTE READ) [3] 

 The travel industry has been embracing AI to streamline bookings and
personalize itinerary planning. Concerns arise about AI homogenizing
travel experiences. However, social media has already been influencing
travelers to flock to popular destinations, potentially diminishing
unique cultural experiences. Some travelers base their whole itinerary
off of a trip they see an influencer do on TikTok or Instagram. On
this front, AI might actually prevent tourism from bottlenecking. AI
is designed to consider the entirety of available data and provide
personalized suggestions that reflect each traveler‚Äôs unique
preferences.

 5 ALTERNATIVES TO ‚ÄúBOOK A DEMO‚Äù CTA (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Everyone knows ‚ÄúBook a demo‚Äù is equivalent to ‚ÄúTalk to a
salesperson‚Äù. Only a very high-intent prospect who‚Äôs not an
introvert, not a coder, and not busy will take up that sales call.
Think about the specific goal the rest of your prospects are trying to
achieve and how you can help them right away. Offer a lead magnet ‚Äî
something useful and engaging that lower-intent prospects will take
advantage of. If prospects are coders, provide them with the code and
let them experiment with it. If most of your visitors consistently
have additional questions, offer Live Chat.

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SHORT-FORM CONTENT (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 73% of consumers prefer to watch short-form videos to learn about a
product or service. 56% of marketers report that short-form video is
the top trend they plan to invest in this year. One of the reasons why
people love this format is that attention spans have gotten shorter
over the last 20 years. Many people now use short-form apps like
TikTok as a search engine because of its ability to provide valuable
information in a short amount of time.
