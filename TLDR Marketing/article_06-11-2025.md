NEWS & TRENDS

 LLM TRAFFIC IS SHRINKING (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 LLM referral traffic is falling after months of growth. ChatGPT's new
router shows fewer citations, cutting outbound traffic even as usage
rises. Clicks are nearly gone, making referral traffic unreliable.
Brands should focus on visibility, not clicks. Mentions and citations
matter more than visits. AI Overviews and zero-click behavior limit
referrals, so it's important to invest in visibility across Reddit,
YouTube, and other forums where LLMs pull data. 

 WHY DO WE LOVE CRINGE? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cringe thrives on social awkwardness and failed self-presentation. It
exposes the tension between how people want to appear and who they
really are. It satisfies audiences' fascination with vulnerability and
authenticity, letting them feel both empathy and relief. For creators
and brands, cringe works best when it's intentional and self-aware,
balancing discomfort with insight. The key is to evoke recognition
without crossing into secondhand embarrassment.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 19M VIEWS IN 48H (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Creator “fav_girls02” reached 19M views in 48 hours with a
“back to school glow up” series that used a consistent hook and
cover image across all posts. Each slideshow focused on a different
topic, like hair, skincare, or outfits, while following a simple
checklist format. The approach made it easy to replicate, feature
other creators, and include subtle product mentions. The key was
posting several parts quickly to keep momentum. The format works well
for niches such as self-improvement, beauty, and productivity. 

 DON'T OVER-RESTRICT LIMITED-TIME OFFERS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Overly restrictive limited-time offers can reduce sales by up to 68%
compared to no offer at all. Research found that 1-day promotions with
normal return policies and flexible navigation lead to higher
satisfaction and spending. People spent 56.6% more in a 1-day charity
sale but 68.3% less when the offer lasted only 1 hour. Limited-time
offers work best when they feel urgent but fair, highlight potential
regret, and avoid unnecessary restrictions that trigger psychological
resistance.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 QUICK TIP FOR FREE/PLUS/PRO CHATGPT USERS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Free, Plus, and Pro ChatGPT accounts have a default setting that
allows OpenAI to use chats and connected data to train its models.
This can be turned off in Settings > Data Controls by disabling
“Improve the model for everyone”. The setting is important when
using connectors that access external tools or data. Business, Teams,
and Enterprise accounts have this data sharing turned off by default,
making them safer for work. Companies should avoid using personal
ChatGPT accounts for business to protect data and privacy. 

 EARNED MEDIA, BRAND JOURNALISM, AND AI VISIBILITY WITH NOAH GREENBERG
(65 MINUTE PODCAST) [10] 

 This podcast explores how brands can adapt to AI-driven search with
Noah Greenberg, CEO of Stacker. It covers the shift from SEO to GEO,
where earned media, brand mentions, and broad content distribution
drive AI citations. PR, content, and SEO are converging, press
releases are regaining relevance, and visibility grows through wide
syndication. Measurement is moving from traffic and backlinks to
trust, mentions, and influence.

 5 WAYS B2B BUYER BEHAVIOR HAS CHANGED (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 B2B buyers now control most of the buying process, completing about
83% of their decisions before speaking with vendors and consuming an
average of 11 pieces of content first. They value originality and
expertise, with 73% trusting thought leadership content over
promotional materials and 86% seeking ideas that challenge their
assumptions. Buyers increasingly prefer specialized firms that deeply
understand their industry, ranking subject-matter expertise as the top
selection factor. Referrals still matter, but buyers now validate them
through a firm's online content, making consistent, expert-driven
marketing essential for closing deals. 

 BRAND… A PRODUCT JOB NOW? (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Brand has become a product responsibility rather than just a
marketing function. Users now form emotional attachments through
product experience, not marketing claims, which makes how a product
feels more important than its features or efficiency. AI search models
are beginning to rank brands based on user sentiment and reviews, and
Semrush predicts AI search traffic will surpass traditional search by
2028. To stay competitive, product teams must design for emotion,
create memorable moments, and focus on delight, because utility drives
usage while emotion drives loyalty. 

 THE HERITAGE DISCOUNT: THE STORY BEHIND THE PRICE (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The heritage discount describes a consistent pattern where sellers
reduce prices for buyers who demonstrate respect for an item's
history. Unlike the typical behavior seen in the endowment effect,
this pricing shift reflects a desire to see value passed on rather
than maximized. To leverage the effect, brands have begun building
digital tools and curated experiences that help consumers preserve or
rediscover their roots. This trend is also evident in national park
campaigns, regional storytelling, and product design linked to
nostalgia.
