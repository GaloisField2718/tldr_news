NEWS & TRENDS

 APPLE TURNS TO GOOGLE TO POWER AI UPGRADE FOR SIRI (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Apple is upgrading Siri and other services by relying on Google
Gemini AI. The multi-year deal reflects that its internal AI could not
match Google in capability or scale in the short term, even though it
plans to keep Apple Intelligence running on its devices and private
cloud systems. Analysts expect consumers to welcome the move as AI
features spread across smartphones, even if AI is not yet a primary
driver of iPhone purchases. The partnership may raise regulatory
scrutiny since past Google deals on Apple devices were worth billions
of dollars, including more than $26bn paid in 2021 to secure default
search placement. 

 BIFURCATION OF THE US ECONOMY HITS THE SHOPPING MALL (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 US shopping malls show a widening split between a small group of
strong performers and a large group in decline as the economy
bifurcates. The top 100 of roughly 900 malls hold about 50% of total
asset value, while the bottom 350 hold just 10%, and C and D malls saw
occupancy fall by more than 26 percentage points from 2016 to 2019.
Pressure is rising as lower-income consumers face higher bills, and
34% of consumers plan to spend less this year, with 43% citing
tariffs. Brands and retailers must either move upmarket to target the
top 10% that drives 50% of US spending or compete harder on value,
which requires strong brand equity to support pricing and promotions.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ZUMBA'S REVENUE GROWTH FROM APP2WEB FLOWS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Zumba increased lifetime value by over 17% by shifting high-intent
users from in-app purchases to app2web checkout, accepting lower
initial conversion in exchange for higher retention, higher
trial-to-paid rates, and elimination of app store fees. Conversion
friction was reduced by mirroring native purchase flows, pre-selecting
plans in-app, defaulting to Apple Pay or Google Pay, and
auto-redirecting users back to the app post-purchase. 

 HOW TO PROVE IMPACT FROM LIFECYCLE MARKETING (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Impact shows in behavior change. Users adopt features, reach value
faster, ask questions, or re-engage before churn. Focus on one key
behavior, compare cohorts instead of campaigns, and track metrics from
immediate actions to long-term outcomes. A simple spreadsheet can
reveal real change. Show what happens after a click or nudge to
demonstrate value. Lifecycle marketing works by changing how customers
engage and find value, not by linking every action directly to
revenue. 

 HOW SIMPLE SEMANTICS INCREASED OUR AI CITATIONS BY 642% (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 HubSpot increased page citations by AI tools by rewriting key content
into semantic triples (sentences structured as
subject-predicate-object). Pages were restructured so core concepts
appeared early and in answer-first phrasing, helping AI models
reliably associate HubSpot with categories like marketing automation.
This change was implemented alongside existing SEO fundamentals such
as schema and backlinks.

 IS IT TIME TO KILL ALL THE MASCOTS? (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Creative teams should challenge default mascot requests and evaluate
whether other brand assets can better communicate value. Strategic
alternatives such as distinctive color systems and direct language can
stand out more effectively than anthropomorphic characters. Mascots
should be a deliberate choice tied to long-term brand strategy, not a
reflexive response to category trends or competitors. 

 NETFLIX WANTED TO REINVENT LIVE TV. IT HASN'T BEEN EASY (6 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Netflix is expanding into live programming to challenge traditional
TV, but reliable live streaming has proved harder than expected. The
company has aired more than 200 events, yet big moments like the Jake
Paul–Mike Tyson fight revealed limits in delivering millions of
unicast streams at once. Netflix has since upgraded routing, tested
fixes through smaller livestreams, and built a live operations center.
It says performance is improving as it prepares for a broader global
live push in 2026.
