STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TAKE-BACK PROGRAMS BOOST PROFITS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 People are willing to pay up to 39% more when companies offer to take
back and recycle products at the end of their lifecycle. In one study,
65% of people chose a more expensive shirt with a take-back program,
compared to a regular shirt. This happens because people dislike
wasting resources and give more value to products when they have a
stronger sense of ownership over them.

 WHY SIMPLE BRANDS WIN (AND HOW TO BECOME ONE) (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Brands become forgettable when they try to be everything instead of
focusing on their core strategy. For example, Five Guys intentionally
did not expand their menu to salads or coffee in order to maintain
focus on their burgers and fries. Brands should focus on doing
less‚Äîbut better‚Äîand be unapologetic about it. It also helps to
take the complexity away from the customer so they know exactly what
value you offer to them.
