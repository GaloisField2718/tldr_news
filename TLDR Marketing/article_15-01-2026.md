and generates status updates with AI. The result? Less time spent on
coordination and more time on the work that actually moves the needle.

NEWS & TRENDS

 GLOBAL PUBLISHER GOOGLE TRAFFIC DROPPED BY A THIRD IN 2025 (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google traffic to publishers fell sharply in 2025 and is expected to
keep dropping through 2026. Search fell 33%, and Discover fell 21%,
with deeper losses since May 2023 and even steeper declines in the US.
Lifestyle and utility sites were hit hardest as AI summaries reduced
clicks. Publishers expect a 43% drop over three years and plan to
scale back on Google, Facebook, and X while shifting more effort to AI
platforms and YouTube. Most expect some AI licensing revenue, but not
much. Confidence in journalism is falling, and leaders are leaning
into creator partnerships and subscriptions to counter shrinking
platform visibility. 

 CHINA'S LONELINESS APP MAKES WAVES (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A simple daily check-in app has gained rapid traction by addressing
fears tied to solo living rather than offering companionship. The app
requires one tap per day and alerts an emergency contact after two
missed days, and it has already charted in markets such as the USA and
Australia after rebranding as Demumu. Its rise aligns with structural
shifts, as China had more than 125 million one-person households in
2020, and the solo living rate exceeds 30%, with projections reaching
200 million households by 2030. The popularity highlights how basic
visibility and being noticed matter to people who feel isolated and
lack strong offline support, creating opportunities for brands to
design products and experiences for solo dwellers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO PRODUCE HIGHLY ATTENDED WEBINARS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Well-attended webinars start with a tactical theme and the right
guest, chosen around either a topic or their expertise. A 1:1
brainstorm with the SME generates content, then AI organizes
transcripts, social posts, and context into a deck outline to reduce
the guest's workload. A detailed run-of-show is created with timing,
sections, roles, and talking points, followed by a first draft of the
deck. A 30-60 minute session with the guest reviews the run-of-show
and deck, gathers feedback, and finalizes the deck as a playbook.
During the event, engagement is actively facilitated. Then immediate
follow-up provides a post-event deal room with recordings, slides,
resources, and speaker info. 

 HOW BRANDS CAN RESPOND TO MISLEADING GOOGLE AI OVERVIEWS (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Google AI Overviews frequently summarize Reddit and Quora discussions
as authoritative answers, which allows outdated complaints or fringe
opinions to appear factual. Brands should continuously monitor
high-engagement forum threads and publish authoritative, AI-readable
content that clearly states verified information and corrections. The
goal is to replace forum consensus with primary sources that AI
systems can confidently cite.

 GOOGLE'S UPDATED VEO MODEL CAN MAKE VERTICAL VIDEOS WITH 4K UPSCALING
(2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google updated Veo 3.1 to generate short-form video using up to 3
reference images so visual elements remain stable across outputs
instead of drifting between generations. The update enables native
9:16 vertical video, making clips immediately usable for social-first
distribution.

 TALK WITH YOUR HANDS TO BE MORE PERSUASIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Using hand gestures while presenting increases perceived competence.
It also increases persuasiveness and positive audience reactions by up
to 9%. In an analysis of 2,184 TED talks and 200,000 clips, each
doubling of hand movements led to 5.18% more YouTube likes. In
experiments, a circular gesture during a face cream pitch drove 9%
more positive responses than no motion and 7.7% more than pointing. 

 GEN AI IS THREATENING THE PLATFORMS THAT DOMINATE ONLINE TRAVEL (10
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Generative AI is weakening the discovery advantage that online travel
platforms like Expedia and Booking.com built through search-driven
aggregation. As consumers plan trips inside conversational AI tools,
intent is forming outside aggregator websites, reducing their ability
to influence decisions and monetize early-stage demand. To defend
their position, incumbents are integrating with AI platforms like
Google and ChatGPT while experimenting with generative features inside
their own apps. 

 CANVA'S PATH TO PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Canva reached product-market fit by moving prototyping relentlessly
with non-designers and letting real user friction drive product
decisions rather than investor pressure or launch theatrics. Early
research revealed that users froze when faced with a blank design
surface, which led to a short onboarding video and guided interaction
that improved activation and retention. From there, growth compounded
through early evangelists like social media managers, programmatic SEO
that dropped users directly into creation, aggressive global
localization, and disciplined technical and financial decisions that
enabled long-term scale.
