STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 Rivian targets affluent, eco-conscious outdoor enthusiasts with
vehicles like the R1T, R1S, and its Amazon EDV. It positions itself as
a premium yet rugged EV brand, using experience centers,
nature-focused partnerships, and direct-to-consumer sales to build

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 RETHINK YOUR EMAIL SUNSET POLICY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Marketers should design data-informed, tiered sunset policies instead
of removing unengaged contacts indiscriminately. Relying on inflated
open rates, especially post-iOS 15, leads to retaining ghost contacts,
so engagement signals like clicks, site visits, and purchase behavior
should guide list management. A tiered approach tailors re-engagement
flows and suppression timelines based on customer behavior and value.
Automation should be reviewed quarterly to align with promotions,
seasonality, and content relevance, preserving long-term customer
relationships. 

 META SHARES TIPS ON HOW TO MAXIMIZE CLICK-TO-MESSAGE ADS (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Meta's click-to-message ads offer brands a way to build immediate,
personal connections. Brands should use friendly greetings, link all
messaging accounts, and select the right engagement objective. Meta
also recommends testing formats and using conversational copy.
Advanced tips include building lookalike audiences, syncing product
catalogs, and optimizing for leads or purchases. As more conversations
move to DMs, these ads offer a direct way to drive engagement and
sales.

 HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO TURNAROUND A BRAND? (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Brand turnarounds usually take about five years or more, with
companies like Abercrombie and Coach taking up to eight years to
regain momentum. Abercrombie's revitalization began in 2016 and by
2023, it became the top-performing stock in the S&P, surpassing
NVIDIA. Crocs executed a faster five-year turnaround by leaning into
individuality and unique collaborations. The process typically follows
three phases: laying the groundwork with a clear strategy and customer
insight, building momentum through consistent marketing and product
updates, and breaking through with strong consumer perception and
innovation. Effective brand revitalizations rely on focused
positioning, company-wide alignment, and sustained execution—not
quick fixes. 

 HEADS UP, MARKETERS: THAT JARGON HABIT COULD BE COSTING YOUR BRAND
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Employees recall only half of information presented using corporate
jargon, compared to an 80% retention when clear language is used. This
translates directly into millions of dollars of lost productivity
annually. Despite marketing executives widely recognizing jargon as
problematic, its usage continues to expand, particularly due to the
increased reliance on AI-driven communications.
