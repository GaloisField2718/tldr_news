NEWS & TRENDS

 NEW DATA STUDY: CHATGPT CITATIONS ARE 2.3X MORE LIKELY TO INCLUDE A
TABLE THAN GOOGLE SEARCH (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Adding structured tables to content can help improve visibility in
ChatGPT and other LLM-driven experiences. The study found that ChatGPT
citations are 2.3x more likely to include a page that has a table than
Google search results. 13% of the analyzed 25K Google URLs contained a
table, while 30% of ChatGPT citations included one. Pages that use
clear table structures rank highly in ChatGPT citations, including
sites that rely on basic HTML and simple formatting. 

 IT'S COOL TO HAVE NO FOLLOWERS NOW (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 As social media has matured and become more automated, large follower
counts have lost appeal, while modest accounts have gained status.
High followings often signal bots, whereas small audiences suggest
authenticity and the ability to succeed without performing online.
Post-pandemic algorithmic feeds and alternative platforms have made
audience growth easier to game, increasing the cachet of low-follower
profiles. Many creators now embrace unpolished, personal content that
reflects real interests rather than chasing metrics.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 5 MARKETING PLANNING THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Using thought experiments can shake up defaults and spark fresh
ideas. Teams can explore growing with existing content and driving
growth from current leads without adding new accounts. They can test
differentiation if a competitor copied the product or if it went free.
Binary choices reveal true priorities, and imagining a dream speaker
clarifies brand narrative. These exercises can help reveal blind
spots. 

 SPEAK LOUDLY TO CLOSE MORE SALES (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A loud tone increases sales and speeds decisions for both new and
returning customers. New customers respond best to a loud, energetic
voice, which raises purchase likelihood by up to 8% and makes the
salesperson seem 26.7% more excited. Returning customers respond best
to a loud but calm tone, which raises purchase likelihood by 5.4% and
boosts perceived competence by 4.8%. Energetic tones reduce purchase
likelihood for returning customers by 3%.

 A/B TESTING: THE SCIENCE OF NOT FOOLING YOURSELF (6 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Most reported results in research are unreliable because many claims
come from weak observational studies and fail to replicate in
controlled experiments. For example, a Yahoo study predicted an 871%
lift from display ads when the true effect was 5.4%. A/B tests remain
the most trustworthy way to establish causality, yet even
statistically significant results can be false when success rates sit
near 10% and multiple testing inflates false positives. Small effects
require huge samples - more than 240,000 users - to detect a 5%
relative lift on a 5% conversion rate. Extreme results from small
studies often collapse under replication, so strong claims demand
strong evidence. 

 'MINDSHARE' IS THE MOST IMPORTANT B2B METRIC YOU'RE NOT TRACKING (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In B2B sales, most decisions are made before the first sales call.
Research shows that 94% of buyers purchase from the brand they thought
of first. Mindshare refers to the mental presence a brand holds in the
minds of ideal customers. It is built through consistent, relevant
exposure across content, thought leadership, and PR. A recent campaign
by a SaaS company that increased visibility through executive LinkedIn
content and industry publications resulted in a 38% rise in branded
search and a 19% reduction in sales cycle length. 

 ‘WE POUR GAS ON WHAT WORKS': CHIPOTLE CBO ON HIS RECIPE FOR
REBELLIOUS MARKETING (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Chipotle's marketing uses its real-ingredient positioning to justify
creative campaigns across unexpected cultural spaces. A spelling bee
activation contrasted its simple ingredients with complex competitor
terms, while a temporary tattoo offer tied to an internet trend drove
record off-peak sales and over 9 billion PR impressions. The approach
focuses on early testing in highly relevant communities and scaling
ideas that show performance. Each campaign is measured with attention
to cost and outcome, with longer-term initiatives in sustainability
and food sourcing balancing the short-term activations.
