 PINTEREST REACHES 578 MILLION USERS, IMPROVES REVENUE INTAKE IN Q2 (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pinterest grew to 578 million monthly users in Q2, gaining 8 million,
all from outside the US and Europe. While user decline in Europe and
stagnation in the U.S. raises concerns, Pinterest still posted $998
million in revenue, up 17% year-over-year, helped by Gen Z engagement
and improved shopping tools. 

 GOOGLE SEARCH BOSS SAYS AI ISN'T KILLING SEARCH CLICKS (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 In response to growing concern over AI-driven SEO disruption, Google
claims search clicks haven't declined and users are getting better
results. The conclusion is that AI is not really shrinking traffic,
but concentrating it in a few domains. One example of a winner in this
scenario is Reddit, which is seeing a 21% DAU growth after its
partnership with Google.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WIN REPORT: WHY ADDING ONE BUTTON INCREASED SALES BY 30% (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Adding a sticky footer button that returned users to the top of the
page led to a 30% increase in sales and revenue per visitor for a pet
insurance comparison site. Both tested button versions outperformed
the original page, but "Back Up To Plans" was the most effective
despite receiving less than half the clicks of "View Plans". The test
showed that mobile users face more cognitive load when scrolling,
which can hurt conversions. The button gave users a simple way to
navigate back, reducing friction and increasing the likelihood of
purchase. 

 HOW TO 2X YOUR EMAIL OPEN RATE AND CTR (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Start with a “base sending segment” (BSS) of highly engaged
subscribers, defined as those who signed up in the last 10 days,
opened an email in the past 30 days, or clicked in the past 60 days.
Email only this group in week one, then expand the criteria each week
for 4 weeks to gradually include less-recently engaged subscribers.
This phased approach strengthens engagement, inbox placement, and
sender reputation so more messages land in primary folders instead of
promotions, with results often showing a 20-30% lift in opens and
clicks. Avoid blasting your full list during this period to maintain
deliverability. 

 PLAYING DEFENSE: HOW AND WHEN BIG BRANDS RESPOND TO NEGATIVITY ON
REDDIT (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Reddit has become a critical channel for shaping brand perception as
user posts on product flaws, billing issues, and company policy can
quickly influence public sentiment. Brands such as Tailscale,
Cloudflare, and Mint Mobile are examples of companies that set the
tone by responding promptly and directly, particularly during security
or enterprise-level incidents. Response strategies now follow a clear
hierarchy, where executive involvement is expected in high-stakes
threads while pricing or product feedback requires brief
acknowledgment without overpromising.

family and career is a competitive advantage.

adults navigating life in New York, reflecting the everyday
experiences of Bilt's core demographic. Produced entirely in-house,

 HOW YUM BRANDS PREDICTS THE ‘IT' BEVERAGE OF THE FUTURE (5 MINUTE

 Yum Brands is transforming beverage strategy by combining cultural

betting-style prediction markets. This process helps identify which

rollouts. KFC is currently applying these insights through its new
Kwench concept in international markets, featuring lemonades,
milkshakes, and iced coffees tailored to changing consumer
expectations.
