NEWS & TRENDS

 INSTAGRAM MAY LAUNCH SEPARATE REELS APP TO TAKE ON TIKTOK (1 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Instagram is reportedly considering launching a separate Reels app
amid uncertainty over TikTok's future in the US. President Trump
granted a 75-day extension to the law threatening a TikTok ban and
floated the possibility of a joint venture between the US and
ByteDance, but was unclear how that would work. The law was enacted
due to arguments that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for
spying and political manipulation. 

 TIKTOK SUNSETS ITS CREATOR MARKETPLACE FOR TIKTOK ONE, A BROADER
SOLUTION WITH AI TOOLS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TikTok will shut down its Creator Marketplace on April 1, replacing
it with TikTok One, which is an expanded platform with AI-powered
creative tools. The new system integrates AI features like the
Symphony Assistant for trend analysis, script generation, and video
creation, reducing reliance on traditional creator collaborations.
This move shifts TikTok's approach to influencer marketing by
prioritizing AI-driven campaign execution over direct creator
collaborations.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 IMPROVING THE SIGN-UP EXPERIENCE FOR MILLIONS OF USERS FOR A LEADING
AI SAAS COMPANY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Customer research found that many of Undetectable AI's site visitors
worried that using AI would result in non-human sounding content and
ultimately put their work and reputation at risk. The company used
this finding to optimize its sign-up flow, which increased sign-ups by
3%. This involved consolidating three different sign-up forms into a
single version, while also adding social proof, a clearer value
proposition, and targeted messaging. The change improved conversions
and set the stage for further optimization. 

 HOW WYNTER RUNS BRAND AWARENESS SURVEYS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Measuring brand awareness is best done through surveys tracking
unaided and aided recall, brand preference, and consideration sets.
Use targeted surveys every 6-12 months instead of relying on
fragmented share of search data to gauge the impact of brand marketing
efforts. A sample of 100 B2B respondents provides reliable insights
with a ~10% margin of error, offering actionable data quickly and
cost-effectively. This approach allows for faster decision-making and
a competitive edge with minimal time and expense.

READ) [8]

upgrades. Optimize onboarding for ‘Prospective Premium Users' with
clear activations and pricing tests. Keep ‘Active Subscribers'
engaged with personalized experiences and upsell highly engaged users.
Re-engage ‘At-Risk and Churned Users' with habit reinforcement and
targeted offers. Leverage ‘Product Champions' through referral
programs, exclusive perks, and social proof to reduce acquisition
costs.

 WHAT DUOLINGO'S DEATH SAYS ABOUT MODERN SOCIAL MEDIA (3 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Duolingo's viral campaign, where it “killed off” its owl mascot
Duo, shows the power of character-driven storytelling. The campaign's
success, with over a billion organic views, proves that brands need a
relatable, consistent personality, whether through a mascot or
spokesperson. Duolingo's approach connected with fans by developing
Duo's persona over time, creating genuine engagement. However, brands
must be careful with humor, especially around sensitive topics like
suicide.
