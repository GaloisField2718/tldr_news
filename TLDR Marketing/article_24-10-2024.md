NEWS & TRENDS

 GAMES MARKETING FIRM LIVEWIRE ON THE ATTENTION ECONOMY ACROSS
GENERATIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Gen Z and Gen Alpha expect brands to engage with them in-game through
immersive experiences, not just traditional ads. 76% of Gen Alpha
gamers enjoy branded in-game moments like custom worlds or character
skins, compared to 54% of Gen Z and 49% of Millennials. These younger
generations prefer playable experiences over video ads and value
immersion in gaming and advertising. Brands must adapt to this shift
by creating engaging, authentic in-game experiences to capture
attention. Games companies also need to work closely with advertisers
to meet these new expectations. 

 NEW FIVE9 STUDY FINDS 75% OF CONSUMERS PREFER TALKING TO A HUMAN FOR

presence. While AI can streamline routine tasks, over half of
consumers report frustration with chatbots, particularly among older
generations. With increased holiday demand, brands must manage AI and
human interactions effectively to maintain loyalty, as 40% of
consumers link positive CX with brand commitment.

 The best-fit accounts convert 2-3x better than the rest, showing the
importance of precise ICP targeting. This article provides 40+
actionable plays to build pipelines using enriched data,

need for seamless collaboration across marketing, sales, and product

 HOW TO WIN AT LIFETIME CUSTOMER VALUE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 CRO doesn't end with the first purchase. Increasing repeat purchases
and encouraging customers to share with friends is key to growth.
Focusing on Lifetime Customer Value (LCV) allows businesses to outbid
competitors in ads by recouping costs over time as loyal customers
spend more. Using Net Promoter Score (NPS) helps measure customer
satisfaction and potential for referrals. Upselling and cross-selling
can also increase LCV. Optimizing every aspect of the customer
experience, even product design, enhances satisfaction and boosts
long-term business success. 

 4 PRODUCT MARKETING ADS FOR PAID SOCIAL (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Being specific is crucial for educating new audiences for early-stage
SaaS brands. This post offers four templates that clarify value: the
"Before/After" method shows transformation, "Capability" focuses on
core functions, "Question" prompts customer reflection, and "Problem"
highlights issues users might not know they have. These approaches
build brand associations in prospects' minds, positioning products as
solutions to relevant problems.

 EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE LATEST VERSION OF CLAUDE (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The latest update to Claude, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, allows it to interact
directly with computers, enhancing its usability beyond just answering
questions. It can now click, type, fill forms, search, plan routes,
and even debug code. These skills, although still in a beta phase and
prone to errors, enable Claude to automate tasks and conduct research.
Anthropic has improved Claude's reasoning, coding, and knowledge
abilities, positioning it competitively with other AI models. 

 DATA SHOWS INSTAGRAM REELS ARE BEST FOR REACH — BUT NOT ENGAGEMENT
(8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Instagram Reels generate 36% more reach than carousels but fall short
on engagement, with carousels outperforming Reels by 12%. Reels
benefit from a dedicated feed that promotes discovery by
non-followers, while carousels reappear in users' main feeds, driving
more interactions. Single-image posts, though still popular, deliver
the lowest reach and engagement of all content types.

 YOUR FRIENDS HAVE MORE FRIENDS THAN YOU — AND THAT'S A GOOD THING
FOR MARKETERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The friendship paradox shows that a person's friends tend to have
more connections, which can be leveraged to boost marketing campaigns.
Research offers two methods to target well-connected individuals: the
ego-based strategy, where a person provides one friend's contact, and
the alter-based strategy, where multiple friends are selected
randomly. These methods are more effective than random targeting,
allowing marketers to reach fewer people while spreading messages more
widely. They also respect privacy, which makes them easier to apply in
marketing efforts to increase product awareness. 

 WHY BRANDS ARE RACING TO GET INVOLVED IN RUNNING CLUBS (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Singles' running clubs have gained popularity as alternatives to
dating apps. They offer brands a chance to target demographics outside
of traditional advertising and connect with consumers who identify
with wellness and fitness. Saucony partnered with groups like Black
Girls RUN! to offer custom shoes while Gainful targeted casual runners
with hydration and supplements. 

 WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED AT NETFLIX GAMING? (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Netflix shut down its video game studio, Team Blue, before it could
release any titles due to the complexities of game development.
Despite bringing on top industry talent, the project never released a
title. The company may have realized that competing at this scale in
the video game industry was riskier than expected. However, it remains
committed to gaming and will focus on mobile titles and using games to
enhance its subscription value.
