TLDR MARKETING 2025-12-17

 RANK YOUR VIDEO CONTENT ON AI SEARCH WITH LLM-FRIENDLY EMBEDS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 SEO isn't just about publishing blogs anymore. AI tools like ChatGPT,
Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini will happily "learn" from your videos -
but it's not as simple as publishing them on your website or Youtube
channel.

Wistia [4] built a simple, elegant solution that lets AI tools
“see” and understand your video content [4] without changing the
viewing experience for your audience - so that your content is
accessible and visible to both human visitors and AI tools like
ChatGPT.

NEWS & TRENDS

 SOCIAL MEDIA PREDICTIONS 2026 (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Social media and branding will focus on tastemaking and radical
personalization next year. Brands will adopt “spam” accounts to
share unpolished, slow content. Creators will take real ownership in
brands as Chief Creative Officers or shareholders. Immersive third
spaces like cafes and pop-ups will build community. A revival of
2016-style moodboard aesthetics, updated for Gen Z, will emphasize
maximalist individuality and nostalgia. Brands that let people
co-create, remix, and play with personalized experiences will thrive. 

 COMPANIES ARE DESPERATELY SEEKING ‘STORYTELLERS' (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Corporate America is hiring more storytellers to shape brand
narratives across blogs, podcasts, social media, and events. There is
a shift from traditional media to direct audience engagement. These
roles go beyond copywriting, blending communication, marketing, and
real-world experiences to connect with customers, investors, and
employees. Demand for storytellers has doubled on LinkedIn, with
companies seeking authenticity and human relatability as audiences
grow wary of AI-generated content. Brands now prioritize original
content creation internally to maintain control over their messaging.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO BE COMPETENT VS FUN ON SOCIALS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Follower growth depends on whether the audience wants information or
entertainment. When people seek information, balanced content builds
credibility and drives follows, as Yelp accounts with 3 to 4 star
ratings gained up to 105.5% more followers than overly positive ones
and up to 500% more than consistently negative ones. When people seek
entertainment, highly positive content performs best and drives up to
116.3% more followers on average. Brands focused on sales should match
tone to intent, since friendly and genuine content converts better
even when credibility signals like verification are present. 

 6 PIECES OF ADVICE TO BUILDING YOUR PERSONAL BRAND ON LI (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Building a personal brand on LinkedIn is about owning your story, not
your job. Start by commenting thoughtfully on others' posts to
leverage existing audiences, then mix personal and work stories in
your own posts to show vulnerability. Capture ideas as they come to
avoid writing cold, and use tools to simplify content creation. Be
approachable and relatable rather than overly polished. Make sure your
profile reflects your personality and story. Consistency matters more
than perfection.

 HOW TO AUDIT E-E-A-T AT SCALE WITH SCREAMING FROG AND OPENAI API (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A process and set of prompts to audit E-E-A-T at scale using
Screaming Frog and the OpenAI API. It's designed to score content
quality across multiple dimensions. The process runs multiple AI
prompts per page to score authorship, citations, effort, originality,
intent, writing quality, and subjective quality, then analyzes
averages in Sheets or Excel to find patterns. A real blog audit showed
strong authorship and intent at about 9 out of 10, but weaker citation
quality and content effort near 5 out of 10. The method is best for
high-value pages and when followed by AI pattern analysis for
prioritization.

 COMBATING THE CONSUMER ‘JOY DEFICIT' THIS SEASON (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Holiday campaigns need to reflect the reality that most shoppers are
financially stressed and price-conscious. Brands are seeing stronger
results from early sales, resale options, and emotionally resonant
messages instead of pressure-heavy promotions. Highlighting group
activities over individual gifts and bundling affordable luxuries can
help shoppers feel joy without overspending. Consumers are highly
sensitive to pricing tricks, so clear value and trust are more
important than urgency this season. 

 IF YOU QUIT SOCIAL MEDIA, WILL YOU READ MORE BOOKS? (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Quitting social media may free time, but it won't automatically make
people read more books. Social platforms shape reading habits by
connecting users with tailored content. It fosters focused exploration
and helps discover niche interests. Reddit, TikTok, and Substack can
expose readers to books they wouldn't otherwise find, though they may
also reinforce filter bubbles. While in-person book clubs offer richer
intellectual engagement, social media enables personalized learning,
making the effects on literacy complex and nuanced. 

 WHY 2026 COULD BE THE YEAR OF ANTI-AI MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Brands that can prove their content is human-made may gain an edge in
2026. As AI-generated media saturates every channel, consumer trust is
showing cracks. Companies like iHeartMedia and Apple TV are already
marketing “made by humans” as a premium feature. The shift creates
opportunities for campaigns that emphasize transparency and creative
authorship, especially as pushback against AI deepens in culture and
public spaces.
