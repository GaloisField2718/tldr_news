 DRIVING PAID TRAFFIC TO A LANDING PAGE VS. PRODUCT PAGE: WHAT IS
BETTER? (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Direct traffic to a landing page to match it with the audience seeing
the off-site message. This increases the likelihood that visitors will
be educated and primed by the landing page content to purchase the
product. Traffic can be sent to a product-specific landing page or
product page if the user is searching for a specific item or model
number. This creates a seamless customer journey and moves shoppers
through the funnel. 

 5 PLANNING PITFALLS GTM TEAMS SHOULD AVOID (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GTM planning pitfalls include mathism, which over-relies on numerical

expense of sustainable growth. Idealism results in unrealistic plans
disconnected from current realities. This article presents 3
frameworks to address and overcome these issues: MOVE, CAT, and the
8-Pillar GTM Operating System.

 HOW TO WRITE A WINNING TESTIMONIAL FOR YOUR BUSINESS + A TESTIMONIAL
TEMPLATE (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 77% of shoppers specifically seek out websites with ratings and
reviews before they commit to a business or product. Companies should
reach out to customers to ask if they'll provide positive feedback to
use on the website. Start by asking customers a series of questions to
gather valuable information, rather than leaving it up to them to
write the testimonial from scratch. This article provides a 5-point
testimonial template that can be filled in with the information
gathered from the questions.
