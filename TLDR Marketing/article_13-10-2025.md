NEWS & TRENDS

 IN THE AGE OF AI, WEBSITES WILL BE TRANSFORMED (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Websites will move from static pages to agent-powered interfaces.
Traditional navigation will give way to intelligent, interactive
experiences. Users will interact with AI agents that understand their
needs and curate content in real time. Layouts will adapt dynamically,
creating personalized, conversational web experiences. This shift
could change how information is accessed and how sites are structured.
Even AI-driven traffic may affect how platforms handle visitors. 

 THE HIDDEN COST OF VIEWBOTTING (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Viewbotting is undermining trust in live streaming by inflating
metrics and wasting marketing budgets. Twitch logged 30M and Kick
nearly 20M hours of fake watch time in Q2 2025. To combat it, brands
should focus on verified engagement over view counts, monitor
behavioral red flags like unusually stable audiences or low chat
activity, and use advanced analytics and third-party verification.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 REDDIT IS WINNING THE BATTLE FOR TRANSACTIONAL KEYWORDS (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Reddit now drives more bottom-of-funnel traffic than G2 or Capterra,
as Google rewards authentic discussions over polished SEO content.
Brands that invest in review platforms are missing where real buying
decisions happen. To compete, they should build a presence using a
subreddit, a brand-owned account, and a user persona for organic
participation. Tactics include joining high-intent threads and
starting buyer-led discussions. This builds SEO visibility and can
influence AI-generated search results. 

 DOES THE WORLD NEED ANOTHER COOKBOOK? YES (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cook's Illustrated engages readers by using images to show key points
and product benefits. It guides different audience segments to what
interests them. The content surprises readers with unexpected
insights, giving them something to share. It creates a sense of depth
and value, offering useful information before asking for a purchase.
Visual demonstration, clear guidance, moments of surprise, and a
perception of depth lead readers to act and build trust.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOWIE (TOOL) [8] 

 Howie is an email-based scheduling assistant that manages calendars
like an EA. It handles meeting coordination, rescheduling, conflict
resolution, recurring 1:1s, and follow-ups. It integrates with Google
Calendar and Zoom. 

 TOO MUCH FEEDBACK, TOO LITTLE CLARITY? HERE'S HOW PRODUCTBOARD'S AI
FIXED IT (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Productboard's AI-powered solution, Pulse, helps brands turn
disorganized customer feedback into actionable insights. Arena by PTC
used Pulse to analyze thousands of customer inputs instantly, which
ensured decisions were based on real demand instead of assumptions.
The platform automates feedback categorization and connects insights
directly to product roadmaps, creating a single source of truth across
teams.

 DOES SIMPLE CONVERT BETTER? 4 “BORING” SALES FUNNELS ANALYZED (6
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Complex funnels underperform when design outweighs clarity.
Grasshopper used a simple path from homepage to pricing to checkout.
KlientBoost centered on a valuable offer with a short form to reduce
cognitive load. Growbo educated prospects with blog content, offered a
lead magnet, and ended with a concise pricing page. All focused on
sequencing and delivering real value rather than flashy design or
elaborate UX. 

 THREADS MARKETING MISTAKES THAT COST ITS GROWTH (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Threads gained 100M sign-ups in five days, but poor positioning and
missing features like search and hashtags caused engagement to
collapse. Overactive moderation, misaligned algorithms, and a lack of
marketing tools further eroded trust. Meta has since added features
and stabilized growth, but Threads' early mistakes show that hype
without clarity leads to rapid decline.
