NEWS & TRENDS

MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI crawlers are overwhelming websites with excessive traffic, slowing
them down or nearly taking them offline. iFixit and Game UI Database
both blocked crawlers from Anthropic and OpenAI after experiencing
major performance issues. While AI companies claim to follow industry
standards, website owners report disruptions and high costs. Many
sites are now blocking AI crawlers using robots.txt.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MIXED METHODS EXPERIMENTATION: 4 POWERFUL USE CASES + EXAMPLES (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Mixed Methods Experimentation combines multiple user research methods
to overcome the limitations of each individual methodology and to
understand the why behind given results. For example, when optimizing
a product description page, start with UX research to understand user
blockers and concerns, then use those insights to prioritize
hypotheses to validate in A/B tests. Alternatively, it can be useful
to pair A/B testing with user research simultaneously to help explain
the winning test result. 

 THE RAMEN BRAND WITH AN INTERVIEW SHOW (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 immi's TikTok show ‚ÄúRamen on the Street‚Äù asks life questions to
strangers while the host wears a ramen costume, which leads many of
its viewers to comment things like ‚ÄúI needed to hear this.‚Äù The
series, which took nine months to go viral, highlights how separate
accounts for niche content can build organic growth. Viewers often
forget it's a brand-led initiative, helping raise top-of-funnel
awareness for immi. 

 GO FOR PAID SUBSCRIBERS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Free content is the best way to advertise paid subscription products
as it helps to build trust and brand recall. That said, simply
offering extra content isn't enough ‚Äì successful subscription models
must deliver ongoing, unique value to justify the recurring payments
in the customers' eyes. Engaging inactive subscribers and offering
flexible cancellation options are effective strategies to maintain a
low churn rate and keep the base growing.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 THE ONLY GOOGLE ADS SCRIPT YOU NEED FOR KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION (8
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Running n-gram analyses through Google Ads scripts allows marketers
to break down search terms into single words or phrases, providing a
clearer picture of performance. This approach helps pinpoint keywords
that drive conversions and identifies underperforming terms to
exclude. This type of in-depth analysis is vital for optimizing search
campaigns and improving overall efficiency once basic improvements are
already done. 

 FYXER.AI (TOOL) [13] 

 Fyxer AI organizes your inbox, drafts emails, and creates meeting
notes across platforms like Gmail, Outlook, Slack, and Zoom. One of
its main features is the ability to help users quickly prioritize
emails by categorizing them into actionable folders, making it easier
to respond to important messages. Fyxer can save time by automating
follow-up emails and drafting replies in a personalized tone.

 MARKETING TEARDOWN: PIT VIPER (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Pit Viper's marketing is built on bold, unapologetic branding that
leverages extreme sports culture and 90s nostalgia. Its neon-colored,
attention-grabbing sunglasses and irreverent attitude appeal to a
niche audience that embraces adventure and humor. By using nostalgia
and memes, Pit Viper creates a strong emotional connection,
prioritizing the 5% of customers who love its unique style rather than
trying to appeal to everyone. Its success demonstrates the power of
branding that dares to be polarizing while fully embracing its core
audience. 

 WHY WOULD THE TRADE DESK WANT IN ON THE TV OPERATING SYSTEM WARS? (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Trade Desk (TTD) reported a 26% revenue increase to $586 million
but faces a critical period ahead with potential challenges like CTV
inventory shifts and signal loss from Chrome. TTD's premium valuation,
nearly 50 times its 2025 operating cash flow, raises expectations for
continued high growth. A potential TV operating system play could give
TTD more data control and reshape TV ad measurement. 

 ZAPIER'S HEAD OF PAID ADS ON STORYTELLING, AI-TARGETED ADS, AND WHY
HE'S ALL-IN ON INFLUENCER MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 ‚ÄúPaid ads live and die in the month of spend‚Äù is yet another
signal that brands need to increase their focus on influencers and
storytelling for long-term brand growth. Influencers are proving
crucial in both B2B and B2C, as their presence on customer-centric
platforms surpasses the reach of traditional paid ads. Storytelling
continues to be a cornerstone of effective marketing and the right
influencer partnerships can help build stories that resonate and
connect with the target audience.
