NEWS & TRENDS

 TEMU AND SHEIN'S BLACK FRIDAY MARKETING HEFT PRESSURES OTHER
RETAILERS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Paid search ads drive up to 30% of online sales but can account for
half of marketing costs, making keyword bidding fiercely competitive.
Temu and Shein's aggressive bids on rival keywords like "Walmart Black
Friday deals" have inflated costs, with terms like "Walmart clothes"
increasing 16-fold in two years. Retailers face tighter margins as ad
returns shrink and consumer interest in deal events wanes - 25% of
shoppers are less likely to participate this year. 

 SOCIAL PLATFORMS ARE RUNNING DISRUPTIVE PROMOTIONS FOR THEIR OWN
PRODUCTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Social platforms have been promoting their own products and
subscriptions. X has ramped up efforts with full-screen pop-ups and
gifting options. Meta is pushing its VR offerings through top-of-feed
ads on Facebook and Instagram. Snapchat is targeting users with direct
inbox promotions for Snapchat+. This shift reflects a growing trend of
social apps becoming commercial entities, using their vast reach to
drive subscription and product sales.

 4 MISTAKES & FIXES ON AD OVERSPEND (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post shares insights from a $290K ad campaign that only
generated $100K in revenue. Key mistakes included over-scaling
high-performing channels, wasting money on low-quality leads, lacking
a structured testing framework, and using short-lived ad copy. To
address these, the team gradually scaled ad spend, focused on lead
quality, implemented clear testing frameworks, and used long-lasting
ad copy. 

 TWO COMMON SEO MISTAKES (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Creating multiple posts for similar keywords like "content marketing"
leads to cannibalization. Content should be consolidated into one
post. Content that fails to match search intent will result in poor
rankings.

 DIARY OF A BRAND: THE DALLAS COWBOYS (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Dallas Cowboys are the most valuable sports franchise globally,
valued higher than Real Madrid and the New York Yankees. Despite
lacking recent Super Bowl success, the team generates $550M in profit
annually, double that of its closest competitor. Early innovations,
such as cheerleaders, national TV exposure, and luxury suites, helped
establish the brand. Jerry Jones further expanded profitability by
securing independent sponsorships and developing revenue-driving
assets like AT&T Stadium and The Star. The Cowboys' robust media
investments and diversified revenue streams, including merchandise and
non-NFL events, solidify their dominance.
