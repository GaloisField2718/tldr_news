NEWS & TRENDS

 INSIDE THE DEBATE AMONG MARKETERS FOR AND AGAINST VIRTUAL INFLUENCERS
(5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Virtual influencers are sometimes used instead of human influencers
as a means to reach new audiences and showcase new levels of
innovation that companies have to offer. The rise of AI and the growth
of the creator economy have sparked a resurgence in marketers'
interest in these digital personas. The arguments for virtual
influencers include low production costs, schedule flexibility, and
control over content. Those against cite the high costs for the tech,
lack of authenticity or emotion, and potential rate declines for human
influencers. 

 GOOGLE SHOPPING ADS GET CONVERSION ANNOTATIONS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google is encouraging merchants to enable ‚Äúconversion
annotations‚Äù ‚Äì social proof badges that highlight a product's
purchase popularity when displayed in Google Shopping ads. Conversion
annotations like ‚Äúbest selling‚Äù or ‚Äú1K shopped here recently‚Äù
provide visual cues about a product's sales performance directly in
the ad unit.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BRUTE FORCE MARKETING: A BULLETPROOF WAY TO ACQUIRE MORE CUSTOMERS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Brute-Force Marketing entails using your own product on behalf of
potential customers and then gifting them the results as if they were
already using it. This requires a lot of manual, non-scalable work,
but it is a bullet-proof way to boost your acquisition rates. This
author recommends identifying potential customers on LinkedIn and then
DMing them the ‚Äògift.' This tactic works because it's unique and
personalized, it shows tangible value, and your labor invested makes
your product seem more valuable. 

 THE PROS & CONS OF LONG-TERM INFLUENCER PARTNERSHIPS (15 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The benefits of long-term influencer partnerships include cost and
time efficiency and predictability. Implementing trial periods,
pitching transparently to creators, and setting clear criteria for
continuation will mitigate risks. To manage creative and audience
fatigue, consider diversifying creative angles, adding incentives, and
spacing out activations. Long-term partnerships also don't have to
mean 1 year long contracts. Consider negotiating shorter terms for 3
months at a time. 

 MAXIMIZING CONTENT CREATION AROUND EVENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While repurposing event content is common, companies today are
creating net-new content during events. AudiencePlus generated 112
pieces of content with 16 speakers in 12 hours at its event. It
planned the event with the digital view in mind. It had 1 camera
person for every 20 people at the event, used speakers for additional
interviews throughout the day, and all speakers were encouraged to
stream their session to their own LI feeds. UserEvidence turned a
2-day event into 8+ months' worth of content. The brand fueled its
content calendar for 3 quarters with the 12 interviews it landed for
the event.

 WHAT ARE ZERO-CLICK SEARCHES & HOW DO THEY IMPACT SEO? (9 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 25.6% of desktop searches and 17.3% of mobile searches result in zero
clicks. These occur when users find answers directly on the search
engine results page (SERP), eliminating the need to click on a link.
While these searches can enhance brand visibility, they may also
result in decreased web traffic. Marketers should target keywords that
trigger SERP features like local packs, featured snippets, and People
Also Ask (PAA) boxes to maximize click potential and brand awareness.

 GROWTH AT DROPBOX: AN INSIDE LOOK (7 MINUTE READ) [12]

like viral marketing. The Growth team at the company has two
functions: Growth Product Management and Data. Its core metrics cover

habit), Monetization (trial starts and free-to-paid conversion), and

 FEAR OF STANDING OUT: WHY BRANDS ARE SCARED TO PUSH (COLORFUL)
BOUNDARIES (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Many brands in the food and drink industry avoid embracing bold
colors due to the fear of standing out too much. They tend to opt for
safer, neutral choices instead. This fear stems from a desire to avoid
criticism and maintain conformity. Brand marketers should embrace what
hasn't been seen, the colors that surprise. There should be a movement
towards the unknown, rather than shying away from it for fear of
getting it wrong. 

 THE CASE FOR THOSE SOMETIMES-TRICKY CUSTOMER SUCCESS STORIES‚ÄîAND
HOW TO GET THEM (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Customer success stories are integral to B2B tech marketing, yet many
companies struggle to consistently collect and present them.
Businesses should prioritize case studies by securing buy-in from
sales teams and endorsing co-marketing clauses in contracts. Make it
easy for customers to participate by providing a clear outline of the
process, keeping interviews short, and handling the writing.
