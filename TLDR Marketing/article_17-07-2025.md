 OPENAI TO TAKE CUT OF CHATGPT SHOPPING SALES IN HUNT FOR REVENUES (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI plans to earn commissions from product sales completed
directly within ChatGPT by integrating a checkout system into the
platform. It partnered with Shopify in April and is testing ecommerce
features that would let merchants fulfill orders inside ChatGPT,
targeting revenue from free users. The move challenges Google's search
and shopping dominance as users increasingly rely on chatbots for
product discovery. Brands are also adapting with "AIO" strategies to
influence product visibility in chatbot responses, raising concerns
about AI-driven search preference and its impact on traditional
advertising. 

 7 CONSUMER BEHAVIOR TRENDS MARKETERS ARE WATCHING (6 MINUTE READ) [5]


 7 key behavior shifts are shaping consumer expectations in 2025,
including hybrid shopping preferences, demand for convenience, and
growing comfort with AI-driven experiences. Consumers now expect
brands to deliver seamless service both online and in-store while
maintaining transparency and sustainability. Homes have become hubs
for work, fitness, and shopping, influencing product development and
marketing channels. As brand loyalty declines, consumers lean on
social proof and personalized content to guide purchases. Higher
spending is expected this year, but buyers are more selective and
research-driven than ever.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE BRAND-DEMAND DISCONNECT (AND HOW HUBSPOT FIXED IT) (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Many brands struggle to convert because their content and offers are
misaligned. The ACOM framework solves this by connecting Audience,
Content, Offer, and Moment. It helps you understand who you're
speaking to, what they need to hear, what action you want them to
take, and when they're most ready to take it. HubSpot uses this model
to guide everything from blog posts to product launches, ensuring each
piece of content drives toward a clear conversion goal. 

 NUMBERS IN LARGER FONTS ARE MORE PERSUASIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Larger font sizes make numbers in ads seem more convincing and
persuasive. In experiments, a lamp's price was judged 9.3% cheaper and
a wine bottle 15% cheaper when the price appeared in a larger font.
People also perceived product features as higher quality and were more
willing to buy, such as being 25.9% more likely to buy a fitness
tracker with a prominently sized “60m waterproof” feature. The
effect does not hold for premium or well-known brands. 

 HOW TO IMPROVE INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS AS A MARKETING LEADER (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many marketing teams struggle with one-way updates, unclear
messaging, and missing context. To improve internal communication,
create consistent messaging frameworks that provide clear, aligned
language. Use a mix of formats like meetings, chats, emails, and
check-ins to keep messages clear and top of mind. Train mid-level
managers to deliver updates confidently. Use storytelling to explain
the reasons behind changes and maintain transparency. Measure
communication effectiveness with surveys and engagement data, then
adjust tactics to keep your team aligned.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 GMAIL'S NEW ‘MANAGE SUBSCRIPTIONS' TOOL COULD CHANGE EMAIL
MARKETING FOREVER (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google rolled out a Manage Subscriptions feature that lists active
email senders and how often they reach a user's inbox. With just one
click, users can unsubscribe without opening emails. This change puts
frequency and engagement under direct scrutiny. 

 WHY LINKEDIN IS SHOWING YOU SO MANY OLD POSTS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 LinkedIn users have noticed older posts appearing at the top of their
feeds, but the company says it's intentional. In mid-June, LinkedIn
updated its algorithm to prioritize relevance alongside recency,
aiming to ensure users don't miss meaningful updates like job changes
or useful insights, even if they're not new. The algorithm considers
factors like your activity history, relationships, and a post's
potential to create opportunities. While power users saw the shift
first, LinkedIn is still fine-tuning the balance.

 NETFLIX WILL NEVER CATCH UP TO YOUTUBE (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 With YouTube capturing nearly double Netflix's TV viewing time in the
US, its creator-centric flywheel and free access model have made it a
dominant force in entertainment. Netflix's reliance on expensive,
hit-driven content limits its flexibility, while YouTube benefits from
infinite scale and low risk. HBO Max is retrenching around the
prestige HBO brand, prioritizing deep engagement over mass appeal. 

 THREE MUST-HEAR MAXIMS FOR BUILDING A CONTENT CULTURE (8 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Companies like Doist, Buffer, Intercom, Zapier, and Microsoft
demonstrate that strong content cultures are built through deep
product understanding, executive sponsorship, and cross-functional
collaboration. At Doist, employees across departments contribute to
content that reflects brand values like trust and transparency.
Intercom's early blog posts came directly from its cofounder, while
Buffer encourages engineers and support staff to spark ideas through
low-friction systems. Lastly, Microsoft developed a formal program to
train internal contributors and measure impact.
