READ) [7] 

 While consumers generally prefer products that appear easy to use,
emphasizing simplicity can lead to greater dissatisfaction when issues
arise. This is because they expect simple products to be flawless,
leading to heightened frustration if they fail. Marketers should be
cautious about promoting simplicity, especially for startups or
companies in complex markets.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 COLD EMAIL BEST PRACTICES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Effective cold emails require more than just catchy subject lines and
CTAs. The Prospecting Venn Diagram emphasizes the importance of
knowing your prospects' personas, accounts, personal backgrounds, as
well as your product's value prop. Start with a 1-3 word subject line
and personalize opening lines to show you've done your homework.
Highlight a relevant challenge the prospect faces and offer a solution
to demonstrate your understanding of their needs. Directly ask for a
meeting instead of using indirect CTAs. Lastly, ensure your email is
concise, easy to scan, and avoid using sales jargon. 

 HOW TO CRAFT BEHAVIOR-BASED ONBOARDING EMAIL FLOWS TO TURN USERS INTO
LIFELONG CUSTOMERS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Sending relevant emails with valuable content related to a user's
specific needs can help motivate them to keep using your product. To
craft an effective new user email flow, first identify key milestones
in your product onboarding. Next, build out the ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù of
your onboarding, which assumes the user completes every onboarding
step. Finally, plan out the ‚Äúsad path‚Äù email flow, which should
aim to inspire and provide tips to the user to make progress. 

 STOP OPTIMIZING FOR A CAC:LTV RATIO OF 1:3 (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Targeting a 1:3 CAC:LTV ratio or trying to lower CAC as much as
possible is not the best strategy. It drives linear funnels instead of
sustainable loops. The LTV calculation is usually loaded with endless
assumptions that make it a useless metric. Use customer payback
periods to measure acquisition activities instead. This article shares
benchmark payback periods for B2C and B2B businesses.

 4 PILLARS OF A POWERFUL CONTENT CREATION SYSTEM (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A reliable content creation system can unlock your full creative
potential, allow you to stay consistent with content creation, and
help you improve the quality of your content. The 4 pillars of a good
system are a Swipe File, a collection of inspiring ideas and examples;
a Story Bank, a collection of personal stories and examples that you
can use in content; an Idea Bank, a collection of your own ideas that
you plan to develop; and a Content Backlog, a reserve of content that
is either ready to post or easy to repurpose. 

 INSTAGRAM CONFIRMS TEST OF ‚ÄòUNSKIPPABLE' ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Instagram is testing unskippable ads that pause browsing with a
countdown timer, a feature reminiscent of YouTube's ad breaks. This
test reflects Instagram's transition towards prioritizing video
content, aligning with its features like Stories and Reels. The trial,

ad revenue at the possible expense of user experience.

 HOW TO CREATE A GREAT TV COMMERCIAL (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A TV commercial needs to feel authentic to land with its audience.
This is why a Starbucks ad flopped while a similar Diet Coke ad
remains in our memory almost 20 years later. A great commercial
focuses on the benefits of the product, which might mean using visual
devices in place of the actual product. They also build aspiration,
presenting a world you want to be part of without being too cheesy.
The production details, such as music and camera angles, are also key
to creating a smooth, multi-sensory experience. 

 THE CONJOINT EFFECT: FROM FRIENDS TO ‚ÄúFOR YOU,‚Äù HOW CREATOR-LED
CONTENT IS CHANGING SOCIAL MEDIA (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Social media used to be focused on connecting with friends. Now it
has shifted towards entertainment and education, similar to
traditional broadcast media like TV. The Conjoint Effect is a theory
that people, brands, and creators are increasingly copying each
other's content. Brands now need to evolve their strategies from
mimicking human behavior to providing value through engaging content.
They need to adopt a listening strategy to identify trends, leapfrog
into unique content creation, and create a flywheel effect for
consistent innovation.
