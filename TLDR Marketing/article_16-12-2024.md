 GOOGLE DECEMBER 2024 CORE UPDATE LANDED & IT'S BIG (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 The December 2024 Google Core Update, rolled out on December 12, is
causing volatility in search results. Many sites are experiencing
drastic ranking changes. SEO tools indicate this update may be larger
than the November update. The SEO community reports major traffic
drops, particularly for retail and grocery sites, and a shift favoring
authoritative sites over newer ones. 

 THE YEAR THE MEMES TOOK OVER REALITY – AND MARKETING FOLLOWED (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This year's social media rewarded the loudest and most divisive
voices. Algorithms pushed memes and controversy into the front page.
Brands leaned into this shift, using memes to try to connect with
audiences and designing campaigns around viral moments. The new
marketing playbook prioritizes cultural fluency - knowing when to
engage and when to stay out.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ONBOARDING DONE RIGHT (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 40–60% of users abandon an app after signing in just once. Instead
of jumping to product tours, start with user research and align
marketing messages to meet user expectations. Tailor experiences to
user needs, like Duolingo adapting to skill levels or Miro suggesting
templates by role. This reduces friction and guides users to their
“aha” members faster. Behavior-driven emails, like celebrating
milestones or following up on errors, can also turn churn risks into
loyalty. 

 THE 13 FUNNIEST MARKETING IDEAS OF ALL TIME (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The funniest marketing ideas thrive on unexpected twists. Turn flaws
into features, like a ring designed to break. Use overlooked spaces,
such as usernames or app release notes, for ads. Viral stunts, like
KFC's chicken-scented Crocs or Taco Bell weddings, create stories
people share. Clever tactics include counterintuitive messages,
celebrity-name tricks like Surreal's “Michael Jordan,” and minimal
investments, like Reddit's 5-second Super Bowl ad.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO MONITOR COMPETITORS' EMAIL MARKETING (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Track competitors' email campaigns using Zapier and ChatGPT in 5
steps: sign up for competitors' emails, forward them to the Zapier
email parser, extract relevant data with ChatGPT, load the data into
tools like Google Docs or Airtable, and analyze it in a business
intelligence dashboard. Sign up multiple times to capture segmented
messaging. This approach allows marketers to monitor competitor email
timing, personalization, subject lines, and promotional structures. 

 11 YEARS OF TRENDS AND INSIGHTS FROM 1,000+ BLOGGERS (15 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Blog posts that emulate social media feeds - such as using multiple
contributors, visuals, videos, and timely updates - perform better
than those that don't. The average blog post takes 3 hours and 48
minutes to write, and longer posts (2K+ words) yield stronger results.
High-quality blogs need frequent updates, with bi-weekly posting as a
minimum for strong performance. AI adoption in blogging has risen to
80% but hasn't yet shown a strong link to improved results.

mechanics to one lesson per day and adding streak duration options

metrics, shows the value of aligning product efforts with growth
goals.
