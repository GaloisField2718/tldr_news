 HOW ATTIO, SQUARESPACE, AND N8N TRACK THEIR PERFORMANCE IN AI SEARCH
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 You know you can no longer ignore AI search - and the first step is
understanding how your brand is actually performing. Most companies
are still flying blind, or relying on random manual prompts that don't
give you an objective ground truth.

End your visibility gap with Peec AI [4]. Track key brand performance
metrics [4] including:

👀 VISIBILITY: How frequently is your company being mentioned,
compared to competitors?

📊 POSITION: Are you the first solution mentioned? Who is?

❤️ SENTIMENT: Are the chatbots saying the right things about your
solutions?

NEWS & TRENDS

 THE RECENCY BIAS THAT'S RESHAPING AI SEARCH (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI search models show a strong bias toward newer content, reshaping
how visibility works across platforms like ChatGPT. A study by Waseda
University found that timestamps alone can shift top-10 results by up
to 5 years, move pieces up to 95 ranks, and reverse 8-25% of relevance
judgments. Older, high-quality content is systematically buried, while
newer, lower-quality material often ranks higher. GPT-4o and
Qwen2.5-72B are the most resistant to this bias, while LLaMA3-8B and
GPT-3.5-turbo are the most affected. To maintain visibility, brands
should update content regularly and use strategies like timestamp
management and temporal context signals. 

 GEN Z SHIFT SEES BRAND LOYALTY GIVE WAY TO TREND-DRIVEN TRUST (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gen Z is driving a shift from traditional brand loyalty to “Trend
Loyalty,” where social media influence outweighs long-term brand
attachment. The new report from SAP Emarsys shows that 45% of Gen Z
consumers trust viral products more, and 43% of them have purchased
items solely because they are trending. About 64% of shoppers say they
are loyal to products rather than brands. The report stresses the
importance of using tools like AI-driven personalization to turn
short-term hype into lasting engagement.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MAKE YOUR DISCOUNTS A BIT HARDER TO GET (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Requiring customers to complete a small task to access a discount can
significantly increase sales. Across eight experiments with over
100,000 participants, redemption rates rose by up to 59% when people
had to enter a promo code or solve a CAPTCHA instead of receiving an
automatic discount. The effect is strongest for moderate discounts and
small tasks but weakens when effort or discount size increases. The
research suggests that people feel more rewarded when they earn a
discount, making them more likely to redeem it and complete a
purchase. 

 HOW TO TURN CHATGPT INTO YOUR BEST PIPELINE SOURCE (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Docebo, a public enterprise learning management system, attributes
12.7% of its high-intent pipeline to AI discovery, a 5x increase YoY,
driven by a one-person content operation focused on answer engine
optimization. The team prioritizes branded search and monitors
share-of-voice within AI queries, using tools like Xfunnel to
benchmark visibility. Branded terms now account for 85% of Docebo's
search traffic as non-branded clicks decline with the rise of AI
overviews. Success is rooted in late-funnel keyword targeting, direct
attribution from demo forms, and AI-optimized content structure that
includes FAQs and comparative formats preferred by LLMs. 

 FRAMEWORK FOR YOUR NEXT QUARTERLY CONTENT MEETING (2 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Start by clarifying the meeting's purpose and engagement rules. Share
what's new, including team updates, new content, or top-performing
posts. Review performance metrics and highlight lessons learned, with
a quick “anatomy of a great post” example to show what made
content succeed. Provide an integrated planning update, noting shifts
in messaging, audience, or priorities, and clearly define roles and
responsibilities. Finish with a calendar update to make the quarterly
roadmap tangible and spotlight key initiatives.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 CHECKLIST: GET YOUR DATA READY FOR THE HOLIDAYS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Brands need clean, consistent data before the holiday season to make
accurate decisions and avoid wasted ad spend. Use a single verified
source for revenue and ad spend data to ensure consistent metrics like
CAC, ROAS, and MER. Review last year's unit economics, anomalies, and
search trends to help forecast demand and adjust pricing or
promotions. Implement real-time inventory visibility and reliable
conversion tracking to prevent overspending on out-of-stock products
and to improve algorithm performance. 

 SHIELD (TOOL) [11] 

 Shield tracks and analyzes organic LinkedIn performance across
personal profiles. It aggregates metrics like impressions, engagement,
audience demographics, posting frequency, and profile growth into one
dashboard to help creators and brands understand what content performs
best. It also supports team and employee advocacy by consolidating
data across multiple LinkedIn users.

 WHAT ELECTRONIC MUSIC FORETELLS ABOUT GENERATIVE AI (3 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 This piece uses the history of electronic music to explain concerns
around gen AI in creative fields. New technology often sparks fear,
first that machines replace human artistry and later that democratized
tools flood the market with mediocre content. Moby's Play shows how
cheap, accessible production can create music that becomes ubiquitous
but often serves as background noise, foreshadowing today's AI slop.
AI will greatly increase content output, but human attention is
limited. The challenge will be selection, not creation, and success
will depend on systems that highlight meaningful work amid the noise. 

 HOW TO CREATE A CRISP, USEFUL BUYER PERSONA (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The process of building a persona must focus on identifying the
actual concerns, motivations, and objections expressed by customers
during the buying process. Personas should capture the triggers that
prompt engagement, the goals buyers seek, the barriers they encounter,
and the criteria used in selecting a solution. Interviews can reveal
deeper insights than surveys or CRM data alone, especially around
issues like cost, where surface-level responses may obscure root
causes such as ROI misalignment. A complete persona includes profile
context, path to purchase, and representative quotes to inform sales
tactics and product development.
