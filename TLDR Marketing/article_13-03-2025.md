strategies required to drive projects forward, communicate with
stakeholders, and improve team dynamics.

NEWS & TRENDS

 THE HOTTEST GROWING REAL ESTATE IS IN THE BACK OF YOUR UBER (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Uber's advertiser count jumped 35% in late 2024, driven by the
growing demand for rideshare ad inventory. T-Mobile's acquisition of
Vistar Media and partnership with Uber also helped expand in-car ad
reach, while Lyft continues to integrate programmatic ad solutions to
attract CPG brands. With geofencing, app-based video ads, and
increasing adoption across industries, rideshare advertising is
becoming a major part of the digital out-of-home landscape. 

 BEST BUY WILL MAKE CREATOR STOREFRONTS ITS NEW POINTS OF SALE (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Best Buy is launching creator storefronts this spring, allowing
influencers to recommend and sell products directly through its
website. This move taps into the growing creator economy, but it
raises questions about the role of Best Buy's blue-shirted associates,
who have long been the company's trusted tech experts. Other
retailers, like Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goods, are turning
employees into influencers, presenting an alternative approach to
blending expertise with content creation. If Best Buy follows suit, it
could not only generate affiliate revenue, but also position its
employees as tech creators. 

 SPOTIFY'S ANNUAL MUSIC ECONOMICS REPORT (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Spotify paid a record $10 billion in 2024, bringing total lifetime
royalties to nearly $60B and fueling a more than 2X increase in global
recorded music revenue since 2014. Independent artists and labels
earned over $5 billion, but rising competition means fewer artists
break through despite more opportunities. Music is more global than
ever, with artists generating $1M+ in royalties recording in 17
languages, while those earning $100K+ recorded in over 50 languages.
Nearly 1,500 artists made over $1M without a chart-topping hit,
showing that success now relies more on dedicated fan bases than
mainstream visibility.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A FRAMEWORK TO FIND YOUR NEXT SCALABLE USER ACQUISITION CHANNEL (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Early-stage growth teams often fail by spreading too thin across
multiple acquisition channels instead of prioritizing the one best
suited to their product. A proven framework categorizes products into
three main distribution advantages: products that encourage organic
sharing, those that drive social virality, and those that meet
existing demand. By identifying the strongest match and focusing
efforts on scaling that channel, companies can achieve fast and
cost-effective growth without the complexity of operating in multiple
channels. 

 THE NEW LINKEDIN VIDEO FEED CHECKLIST (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Keep LinkedIn videos under 1 minute, as short videos dominate the
feed. Start with attention-grabbing hooks like bold points of view or
stories, and use text overlays within the first few seconds to stop
the scroll. Shoot vertically for mobile-friendly viewing and include
captions. Share personal, relatable stories and concise professional
lessons, focusing on educational content. Avoid overloading videos
with hashtags, keep production simple with smartphone videos, and
focus on engaging content rather than a CTA.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 WHERE DO I START WHEN I WANT TO OPTIMIZE AN EMAIL AUTOMATION? (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Many fall into the trap of just rewriting emails when optimizing
email automations — instead, start by auditing performance to
identify what is and isn't working. Begin by mapping the automation
flow, documenting cadence, triggers, segmentation, lead scoring, and
potential "black holes" where leads get lost. Analyze key email
metrics such as open rate, click-through rate, conversion rate,
unsubscribe rate, and revenue attribution to determine which emails
perform well and which underperform. Mark strong performers with green
circles, weak areas with red, and potential optimization opportunities
with yellow. Then, assess sending practices for compliance and
deliverability. Finally, present your findings in a report to your
team before making content changes. 

 5 PROMPTING TIPS FOR ANY AI IMAGE GEN TOOL (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 When creating AI-generated images, avoid over-refining prompts. Use
conversational phrasing with intentional gaps, such as "a blurry photo
of a man mid-laugh", and describe flawed conditions like
"over-processed smartphone photo from 2012". Break centered
compositions by requesting off-balance framing, cropped subjects, or
motion cut-offs to mimic real-world snapshots. Introduce movement by
specifying dynamic elements like windblown hair or mid-gesture
blurring. Finally, simulate imperfections by referencing low-quality
cameras, compressed images, or overexposed lighting to create a more
lived-in aesthetic.

 WHAT WALGREENS' DECLINE TEACHES US ABOUT THE POWER AND PERIL OF
MARKETING (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Walgreens' market value plummeted from $100 billion in 2015 to a $10
billion private equity buyout in 2025, a decline that can be
attributed to major marketing failures. The brand lost relevance by
failing to define its identity, modernize the digital experience, and
enhance its in-store environment. As competitors like CVS and Amazon
strengthened their value propositions, Walgreens' lack of
differentiation made it less attractive and easily forgotten. 

 ARE SYNTHETIC AUDIENCES THE FUTURE OF MARKETING TESTING? (2 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Synthetic audience testing creates digital avatars based on
real-world data to simulate customer responses, offering a faster,
cheaper alternative to traditional focus groups. It relies on
demographics, purchasing behavior, and other data points to model
audience segments marketers can question in real time. This method
could significantly reduce the time needed for consumer insights,
replacing or supplementing slow, expensive surveys and focus groups.
Future developments will focus on microsegmentation and refining
personalization to avoid marketing that feels intrusive.
