 WHAT SUCCESSFUL MARKETERS ARE DOING DIFFERENTLY WITH ABM (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 The biggest challenge marketers face with account-based marketing
isn't figuring out which accounts to target; it's engaging the right
people within the accounts.

To understand where teams are struggling and how they're solving it,
Influ2 partnered with Forrester to survey 163 enterprise marketing
leaders [4].

They uncovered:

 	* How teams are actually running ABM today 
 	* Why most ABM programs struggle without contact-level insights
 	* Where marketers are placing their bets in 2026

NEWS & TRENDS

 SPECFLUENCING: HOW ‘UNOFFICIAL' BRAND MENTIONS ARE CHANGING
INFLUENCER CREDIBILITY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Specfluencing is growing fast as creators tag brands without paid
deals to appear established and attract partnerships. Between June and
September 2025, more than 14,000 influencers posted nearly 77,000
brand tagged posts and generated about 1.2 billion views, and most
posts were unpaid. Experts say this tactic works only when content
reflects real product use and delivers results, since audiences can
detect staged credibility. Brands can use specfluencing to spot new
creators and gain unpaid visibility, but it can also create noise and
weaken trust if performance is poor. Several brands report that
organic creator posts and viral moments can drive stronger trust,
engagement, and sales than traditional paid endorsements. 

 AMAZON TO LAUNCH A MARKETPLACE FOR PUBLISHERS TO SELL CONTENT TO AI
COMPANIES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The proposed marketplace would formalize AI-content relationships,
shifting from unlicensed web scraping to negotiated data access.
Publishers would gain compensation and clearer usage controls, while
AI firms would reduce legal risk and secure reliable, high-quality
data pipelines. The initiative places Amazon in competition with
similar licensing efforts from Microsoft, signaling that structured
data marketplaces may become a core layer of the AI economy.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 POSITIONING VS. MESSAGING (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In PMM interviews, many candidates give answers that lack precision
when asked about positioning and messaging. The two are distinct, and
your response should reflect that. Positioning is internal and defines
the target audience, category, and differentiation. Messaging is
external and translates that foundation into benefits and proof
points. Tailor your answer to the focus of the question, walk through
inputs, process, validation, and activation as relevant. 

 HOW TO USE EXCLAMATION POINTS IN EMAILS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Using exclamation points in emails makes the sender seem friendlier
and more likable, but it reduces how powerful and analytical the
sender appears in serious or task focused messages. Across five
experiments with over 2,000 participants, messages with exclamation
points were rated 13.5% more positive and 21.3% warmer for meeting
requests. The same messages were seen as 9.7% less powerful and 12%
less analytical in assignment or data-focused contexts. The effect
works for both men and women, though women feel 9.7% more pressure to
use them and men feel 17.1% more pressure to avoid them. Exclamation
points work best in friendly and relationship-building emails and
should be avoided in formal, analytical, or deadline-driven messages.

 TRUSTWORTHY A/B PATTERNS: ROUNDED/SQUARE CORNERS PATTERN (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Large-scale replications show that rounding button corners does not
actually produce a large lift in clicks. The original study reported a
55% increase in clickthrough rate from rounded buttons and had a p
value of 0.037, but later researchers judged the test to be
underpowered. Three replication tests found effects near zero with 95%
confidence intervals. A fourth pre-registered test at METRO Russia ran
for 16 weeks with over 7.4 million users, and it found results below
the minimum detectable effects. The combined evidence suggests the
original 55% lift was likely an exaggerated result caused by low
statistical power. 

 WHY YOUTUBE SHOULD BRING ORIGINALS BACK (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 YouTube has surpassed Netflix in revenue and viewing time but still
lacks big TV advertisers. Reviving original content could provide
premium, predictable programming to attract advertisers and retain
creators as competitors secure exclusivity deals. With serialized
content from creators and more viewers watching on TV screens, the
platform is well positioned to explore Originals again through creator
partnerships or licensing.
