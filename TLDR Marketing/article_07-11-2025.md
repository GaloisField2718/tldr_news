 WHEN ALGORITHMS CURATE CULTURE, WHAT DO WE LOSE? (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 As AI curates what we watch, listen to, and read, pop culture will
become predictable. Algorithms favor familiarity, ignoring the context
and creative accidents that drive breakthroughs. Iconic moments in
music, film, and fashion come from risk and experimentation, which AI
cannot replicate. Human curation preserves history, connecting art and
innovation across generations. AI cannot replace the insight and
storytelling that keep culture rich and transformative. 

 HOW BRANDS CAN BE OLD AND NEW SIMULTANEOUSLY (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 KFC successfully uses The Colonel to connect traditional values with
modern relevance, while Cracker Barrel misstepped by removing its Old
Timer mascot. Research from KFC revealed that customers viewed its
longevity and consistency as proof of credibility and quality. The
Colonel's image communicates brand identity instantly, similar to
symbols like the Nike Swoosh or Golden Arches. Brands do not need to
abandon history to stay current, they need to show how established
values fit into today's lifestyles.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE SURVEY EMAIL PLAYBOOK: HOW TO ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE TO TELL YOU
WHAT THEY THINK (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Survey emails are powerful for understanding customers, but they must
be simple and valuable to get responses. Effective tactics include
stating how long the survey takes, explaining why feedback matters,
embedding questions in the email, and offering small incentives.
Personalization, such as using a real sender or asking targeted
questions in welcome and post-purchase emails, increases completion.
Interactive formats like ratings or checkboxes reduce friction.
Collected data should feed directly into audience segmentation and
automation to tailor future messaging. 

 MAKE YOUR BRAND FAMOUS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To build brand recognition, appear where the target audience already
spends time and use existing platforms instead of focusing only on
owned channels. Survey trends, popular content, and creators to find
culturally relevant ideas. Create content that entertains or educates
rather than feeling like a sales pitch. Schedule time to explore
magazines and social feeds for inspiration and adapt insights to the
brand story. Invest in collaborations, podcasts, or co-branded content
to reach audiences where they already pay attention. 

 HOW OWNER.COM 42.2X'D AUDIENCE YOY WITH A 3-WORD STRATEGY (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Owner.com, a platform helping restaurant owners grow, increased its
audience by focusing on world-class content. The team selects ideas
relevant to busy restaurant owners, executes them with high production
quality, and scales through a system with specialized roles in
scriptwriting, filming, and editing. Every piece is evaluated for
usefulness and engagement, with underperforming content canceled after
production.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO MAKE LINKEDIN CAROUSELS USING CLAUDE'S SKILLS FEATURE (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Start by selecting a carousel that perfectly reflects your branding
and tone. Then have Claude analyze it and generate a SKILL.md file
that captures structure, style, and content framework. Upload the
skill to Claude, and it can produce slide-by-slide briefs and full
carousels on any topic, maintaining the original visual identity and
layout. After minor tweaks in Canva, the process delivers on-brand
carousels in about 15 minutes, combining automation with authentic
design. 

 GOOGLE ANALYTICS REPORTING PLAYBOOK (18 MINUTE READ) [12]

surfaces in Google Analytics 4, which differ from previous versions of
Google Analytics. The playbook includes detailed sections on Reports,
Explore, Advertising, Data API, and BigQuery export, as well as
dedicated information on Audiences, Case Studies, Common Questions,
and Reporting Gotchas.

 INSIDE THE CLEVER MARKETING OVERHAUL THAT TURNED THE US ARMY INTO A
RECRUITMENT POWERHOUSE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The US Army's 2024 recruitment success was driven by a
corporate-style overhaul of its marketing infrastructure, hiring
ex-industry leaders from companies like Johnson&Johnson, and creating
50 new internal roles in fields like behavioral economics. Based in
Chicago, the Army's agency AEMO and its creative partner DDB Chicago
collaborate to produce emotionally grounded campaigns such as “Own
the Night” and “Generation” that speak to different political
climates. Campaigns reflect both lived soldier experiences and
strategic brand positioning, with AEMO using exclusive access to
internal data to guide message targeting and tone. 

 FIXING THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN MARKETING AND REVENUE (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Many companies do plenty of marketing but fail to drive revenue
because their efforts aren't tied to real business outcomes. Teams
chase vanity metrics like clicks and impressions instead of focusing
on pipeline and sales. Misalignment between marketing, sales, and
finance creates confusion, while short-term thinking prevents
learning. Real progress comes when marketing is accountable for
revenue, shares goals with sales, and functions as core business
infrastructure that turns activity into measurable growth.
