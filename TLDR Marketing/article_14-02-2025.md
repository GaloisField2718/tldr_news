 4 GIPHY SEARCH TRENDS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS VALENTINE'S DAY (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 GIPHY search data reveals modern Valentine's Day trends: Cuffing
season actually peaks between August and October, with searches for
the term spiking 101% in August and peaking in October. February sees
loneliness surge, with searches for “single” rising 12% and
“forever alone” up 35% compared to January. Meanwhile,
“situationship” searches increase 43%, and “sneaky link” jumps
132%, showing February's focus on non-traditional relationships. 

 BRANDS ARE CONFIDENTLY DISGUISING THEIR LOGOS IN OUTDOOR ADS BUT IS
IT EFFECTIVE? (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 More brands are removing or disguising their logos in outdoor ads,
relying on iconic visuals and slogans to maintain recognition. Heinz,
Kellogg's, and Tesco have embraced this minimalist approach, with
Heinz omitting its logo entirely and Kellogg's focusing on its rooster
mascot. Experts argue this strategy works best for well-established
brands but risks becoming formulaic. While stripped-back messaging can
capture attention in a cluttered media landscape, some believe the
trend needs fresh innovation to remain effective rather than blending
into the background.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SWITCHING SALES: HOW TO GET PROSPECTS TO SWITCH TO YOUR PRODUCT OR
SERVICE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Switching sales involves helping customers move from their current
solution to yours, which often triggers fears of downtime and regret.
To win these sales, position your product as a complement to existing
solutions, like KISSmetrics did with Google Analytics, easing the
pressure of abandonment. Offer a gradual, low-risk transition through
steps like free trials, parallel use, or phased rollouts to reduce
resistance. Provide full migration support, either in-house or through
partners, to remove logistical barriers. These strategies build trust
and make the switch feel safer and easier for prospects. 

 HOW SHOPIFY ORGANIZES ITS GROWTH TEAM (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Shopify powers approximately 10% of US e-commerce and organizes its
600-person Growth Team into Growth R&D and Growth Marketing. Growth
R&D includes teams for landing page optimization, internal tooling for
experimentation, and customer support focused on merchant success.
Growth Marketing covers paid ads, SEO, email, and affiliate marketing,
each with LTV/CAC goals. Their approach prioritizes long-term metrics
like total cohort value over conversion rates and uses 6 to 12 month
holdout experiments to measure lasting impact. 

 7-STEP MARKETING PLAYBOOK (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This marketing system identifies a precise target audience, maps
effective channels, and prioritizes efforts through data. It starts by
defining a "market of one," selecting channels, and working backward
from revenue goals. Owners manage channels, track performance, and
adjust quarterly. The process repeats to focus resources on what
drives growth. A screenshot of a marketing tactic tracker is included
in the post.

 YouTube creators can now use Veo 2 to generate high-definition (up to
4K) AI video backgrounds and entirely new AI-originated short clips
with text prompts. This upgrade enhances storytelling possibilities

 'BRANDING MOMENTS': THE SECRET SCIENCE OF MEMORABLE CONTENT (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Cadbury's 2007 "Gorilla" ad, initially rejected by leadership,
increased sales by 10% and became the UK's favorite ad of the past 60
years. Neuro-Insight, a neuromarketing company, found that it ranked
in the top 1% for long-term memory encoding due to its compelling
storytelling and timing of the branding moment. A “branding
moment” occurs when the audience's brain deciphers the story and the
brand logo is shown, enhancing memory retention. Effective ads
prioritize story over overt selling and use emotional narratives to
engage the viewer. This principle applies to B2C, B2B, creators, and
potentially written and audio content. 

 DEEP DIVE: TABS CHOCOLATE (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Tabs Chocolate is a Gen Z-focused brand known for its viral "Sex
Chocolates," which are marketed to enhance intimacy. It has grown
primarily through TikTok, leveraging user-generated content and bold
marketing. Tabs uses cross-sell strategies like urgency timers and
discounts to boost sales post-checkout. Future marketing ideas include
sex-positive podcasts, educational YouTube videos, and anonymous
“Dear Abby”-style blogs. 

 VIRAL SHORT-FORM VIDEO FORMATS FOR 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Storytelling is the key driver for viral short-form video success. A
proven content model focuses on repeatable structures such as “Two
Characters, One Light Bulb,” where creators play both expert and
novice to explain complex topics, and “Challenge” videos, where
creators take on difficult tasks with dramatic payoffs. The
recommended approach to these videos involves studying performance
patterns through Gold-Silver-Bronze analysis, tracking key engagement
drivers like pacing and reaction shots, and testing formats with
single videos before scaling content production.
