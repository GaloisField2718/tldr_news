 📨 WHAT IF DIRECT MAIL WAS AS EASY AND PREDICTABLE AS DIGITAL?
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Direct mail campaigns require more than slick software. To design,
print, and mail letters at predictable times (and costs!), you need a
national print delivery network with routing, printing, and delivery
infrastructure [4]. And that's why you need Lob [4]. 

Lob is trusted by 12,000+ companies for everything from campaign
building to logistics to analytics. Lob's Postal IQ [5] chooses the
most efficient USPS path before printing even begins, optimizing every
execution step from campaign to mailbox. 

"We can have a mail piece printed and in the mail stream within two or
three days – that's a massive differentiator." - Abby Warner,

NEWS & TRENDS

 THE LENGTHS AMERICANS ARE WILLING TO GO TO MAKE EVERY PENNY COUNT (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Americans are finding creative ways to stretch their budgets and get
more from every purchase. They're diluting cleaners, using smaller
portions of products, shopping at discount stores, buying in bulk, and
growing their own food. These habits are hitting consumer companies.
Procter & Gamble reported a 2% drop in home and fabric-care volume,
while private-label sales stayed flat. One household cut its grocery
bill from $1,696 to $1,265 by portioning carefully. 

 THE 2025 SOCIAL MEDIA SALARY REPORT (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Social media compensation is rising most for veterans. Salaries
jumped 12% for pros with 12+ years experience, while entry-level pay
only matched inflation. B2B specialists earn 10% more than their B2C
peers, and those in tech or working in-house at large companies see
the highest pay. Titles now matter more - splitting Social Media
Manager and Senior Social Media Manager yields a $5K difference in
medians.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SAY WHO YOUR PRODUCT IS NOT FOR (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 People are more likely to choose a product when it highlights who
it's not for. Across eight experiments, ads using negative framing
such as “Not for light coffee drinkers” or “If you don't like
spice, skip this sauce” increased product choice and engagement by
up to 48%. This works because it makes products seem more specialized
and better aligned with personal preferences. The effect has been
strongest for food and drink items tested on US audiences, so results
may vary across categories or cultures. 

 TRAFFIC IS NO LONGER A RELIABLE GROWTH METRIC (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Webflow drives AI discovery through 3 automated tactics. It refreshes
website content at 5X the normal rate, boosting traffic on updated
pages by 40%. Webinars are repurposed into 5-10 content assets each,
reducing post-production time by 80% and increasing AI visibility. It
also automates FAQs with schema markup, which led to a 24% rise in SEO
impressions and 331 new AI citations. This helps its content get cited
by models like ChatGPT and drives higher-quality conversions.

 HOW TO ‘HACK' YOUTUBE'S ‘ASK' FEATURE (1 MINUTE READ) [13]

analytics backend and provides insight into content engagement. Since

 HOW REDDIT BUILT THE INTERNET'S BEST COMMENT SECTION (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Reddit turned its comment section into the platform's main feature.
Its design combined upvotes, karma, and nested threads to make
discussions scalable, helping it reach over 100K active communities
and 2.7B comments a year. The upvote system prioritizes quality over
timing, keeping conversations dynamic and rewarding meaningful
contributions. Karma and threaded conversations further motivate users
to create and explore content in depth. 

 WHICH MARKETING CHANNEL PROVIDES THE BEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR
SMALL GAME PUBLISHERS? (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Small game publishers get the best return when paid ads support, not
replace, community-driven marketing. TikTok and Reddit increase
awareness, but conversions and platform fees can hurt ROI. Publishers
like No More Robots spend around $50k pre-launch to maintain
visibility, while live events, digital showcases, and streamer
collaborations sustain authenticity and word-of-mouth.
