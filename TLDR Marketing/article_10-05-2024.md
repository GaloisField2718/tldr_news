READ) [5]

interaction. This was heavily influenced by TikTok's emphasis on
public posting and content consumption time. Today's social media
algorithms also prioritize entertaining content over divisive or
argumentative posts. This shift has led to a decline in engagement and
interaction on platforms like FB and IG, despite increased time spent
on AI-commended content.

READ) [6] 

 Bloggers who update old articles are twice as likely to report

with less effort compared to creating new content from scratch. The
best content to refresh includes articles that almost rank high,
articles that are at risk of being surpassed by rivals, articles that
created a lot of buzz when they were first published, and research
articles that have gone out of date. This post includes tips for how
to update and re-promote content, as well as 5 case studies on

 8 TIPS IN CREATING A CONTENT STRATEGY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 First, test different AI apps, platforms, or products that'll help
scale production without sacrificing quality. Then, put together an
audit and internal repository of content and resources. Repurpose that
content and create a workflow that's able to post content to LinkedIn
for internal SMEs and thought leaders based on their niche, expertise,
and voice. At the same time, fill content gaps based on customer
research. Turn transcripts from audio-visual recordings into content
for the company blog. Instead of ebooks, white papers, and one-pagers,
optimize landing pages that convert and ensure they're always driving
people to the what's-next step.

 INSTAGRAM BEATS TIKTOK FOR VIDEO-BASED USER ACQUISITION, SURVEY FINDS
(3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 When asked to split their user acquisition spend between Instagram
and TikTok, 79% of respondents allotted at least 75% of their budget
to Instagram. The survey was conducted in February and March 2024,
before U.S. lawmakers approved a bill requiring TikTok to separate
from its Chinese ownership or face a potential ban in the country.

more advertiser-friendly.
