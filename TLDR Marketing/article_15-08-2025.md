 OPTIMIZE CAMPAIGNS BY PAIRING TRADITIONAL AND DIGITAL MEDIA
EFFECTIVELY (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A study analyzing over 1,000 global advertising campaigns found that
pairing traditional media, such as TV and outdoor ads, with digital
channels like YouTube and Facebook can increase key brand metrics by
more than 50%. Successful campaigns adapt their media mix to specific
objectives, using TV with YouTube to build broad awareness and
combining Facebook with in-store promotions to drive local engagement
while prioritizing shifts in brand perception and consideration over
simple reach. 

 HOW THE FCC'S POTENTIAL OVERHAUL OF A 20-YEAR-OLD RULE COULD AFFECT
TV ADVERTISING (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 With TV ad revenue falling and streaming ad dollars surging, the FCC
is weighing whether to scrap a rule that caps broadcast ownership at
39% of the national audience. Broadcasters and industry groups say
loosening the limit would allow networks to become more modern,
attract younger viewers, and better compete with tech platforms like
Google and Facebook. Opponents caution that such a move could give
more power to large corporations or politically aligned owners,
reducing competition and media diversity.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO RECLAIM AI SEARCH TRAFFIC FROM HALLUCINATED URLS (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Hallucinated URLs are web addresses generated by AI that look real
but don't exist on a site. To reclaim AI search traffic from them,
filter analytics to show only AI assistant visits, export the data to
Google Sheets, and use an Apps Script to check each URL's HTTP status.
Identify URLs with a 404 status and significant traffic, then set up
301 redirects to relevant existing pages. This approach turns
non-existent, AI-invented URLs into traffic drivers while revealing
the kinds of content LLMs expect your site to have. 

 AHREFS' CMO 13-POINT GUIDE TO AEO (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Unlike SEO, AEO focuses on how AI represents your brand across the
web. To increase brand visibility in AI chatbot responses, track
current mentions of your brand. Find the top-cited domains and pages
in your niche. Secure placements on authoritative sites. Keep
high-traffic pages accurate and well-structured. Write in clear,
simple sentences. Engage on UGC platforms like Reddit and Quora.
Create AI-friendly content with original research, statistics,
comparisons, and experiments. Close topic gaps where competitors are
cited but you are not. Bet early on emerging topics. Build branded
search demand with unique frameworks and research. Repurpose content
into videos and capture AI “hallucinated” URLs with redirects. 

 WHEN TO RESTRUCTURE YOUR GOOGLE ADS ACCOUNT – AND HOW TO DO IT
RIGHT (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Restructuring a Google Ads account can be a powerful tactic to
restore growth and improve efficiency, but it also comes with risks
such as wiping out historical data and disrupting Google's learning
algorithms. Common warning signs that a full rebuild might be needed
include bloated or mismatched keyword groups, persistent irrelevant
search queries, budgets being spent in the wrong places, and
performance flattening despite regular optimization efforts. The most
effective restructures start with a detailed audit to identify what's
truly working, preserve those high-performing elements, and then roll
out changes in planned stages.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 Golpo AI transforms written content, internal workflows, and course
materials into professional explainer videos and podcasts. It offers
whiteboard animations, supports over 50 languages, and includes script
validation, voice options, and API access for scalable content

it easy to convert complex information into shareable audio and video
content. 

 TIP: CHATGPT'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ChatGPT allows you to add custom instructions that guide its
responses, even on free accounts. These instructions act as an
invisible layer of your prompt, letting you set your name, work
context, and ChatGPT's personality traits, as well as specify writing
preferences like style, tone, and banned words or phrases. To set them
up, go to Settings → Customize ChatGPT, fill in the sections, toggle
“Enable for New Chats,” and save. Adding prompt-style directions
and prioritization notes helps ensure consistent outputs. Keeping a
backup is recommended, as changes can dramatically alter results. This
feature, especially with GPT-5, can significantly improve output
quality.

 SEE HOW THIS HAIR CARE BRAND TURNED WEATHER WOES INTO A MARKETING
MOMENT (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In July, göt2b hosted an interactive pop-up in Brooklyn's Domino
Park featuring a humidity-powered “Emergency Box” that dispensed
free full-size products when humidity reached 60% or higher. The
vending machine allowed guests to select their hair type before
receiving frizz-fighting products, while a scrolling LED sign
indicated when the box was unlocked. Visitors could also take photos
in a “Frizz-Free Photo Zone” and enjoy curl-pattern-inspired
rolled ice cream. TXG, the agency behind the project, also sent
influencer mailers styled as “Emergency Frizz Kits” with faux
glass packaging. 

 THE PROS & CONS OF EVERY AUTOMATED BIDDING STRATEGY IN GOOGLE (11
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google Ads offers eight automated bidding strategies, with some
falling under Smart Bidding, which uses auction-time optimization for
conversions or conversion value. Each strategy serves different goals,
such as Maximize Conversions for lead volume, Maximize Conversion
Value for high-value leads, Target CPA for cost control, and Target
ROAS for profitability. Successful automated bidding requires accurate
conversion tracking, realistic targets, and enough recent conversion
data. Advertisers can mix strategies across campaigns, ad groups, or
portfolios based on goals and data availability. While automation
saves time, performance should be monitored regularly to ensure
campaigns meet objectives.
