NEWS & TRENDS

 ‘IT'S LIKE THEIR ESCAPE': RETRO GAMING IS BACK THANKS TO GEN Z (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Retro gaming is back, with 66% of Britons buying retro tech in the
past two years, and 24% of Gen Z owning a retro console. Popular
consoles like the Game Boy, Super Nintendo, and original Xbox offer a
nostalgic escape from the internet and social media stress. Many
owners kept their retro tech for sentimental reasons, while others
recently purchased discontinued games. The growing #nostalgia trend on
TikTok highlights the continued love for retro gadgets. 

 NEW RESEARCH UNVEILS KEY STRATEGIES FOR INFLUENCER AUTHENTICITY (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Influencers don't need all 5 factors - expertise, connectedness,
originality, transparency, and integrity - to appear authentic. One
missing property can be offset by others. For example, an influencer
doesn't have to be an expert to give skincare advice, as long as
they're a consistent content creator about the topic of skincare.
Transparency about using AI in content creation can build credibility,
and giving influencers creative freedom within brand guidelines boosts
engagement.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LEVERAGING PHYSICAL WELLNESS EXPERIENCES TO DRIVE BRAND LOYALTY (12
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Despite the high engagement in online communities, brands are
investing in in-person experiences. Companies like Red Bull, Nike, and
Bandit Running are leveraging fitness-driven events to foster
real-world connections, reinforcing social identity and deepening
brand loyalty. By tapping into the Health Meta movement, brands are
evolving from selling products to curating lifestyles that drive
community-based relationships.

 SERP ORGANIC AND AI OVERVIEW VOLATILITY RESEARCH (20 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Ranking in Google's top 10 doesn't guarantee you will be featured in
AI Overviews. 40% of cited pages don't appear in organic search
results. AI Overviews and traditional search operate independently,
with AI-generated snippets frequently changing even when the sources
remain the same. This volatility shows the importance of tracking AI
Overview visibility separately from traditional SEO. 

 HOW TO ANALYZE BEHAVIORAL DATA FOR SEARCH (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI-driven search features have cut traditional search volume by up to
25%, shifting SEO toward optimizing the entire user journey.
Behavioral data analysis involves 3 tiers: basic data (e.g., Google
Search Console, surveys) to find user frustrations, next-level data
(e.g., analytics, heatmaps) to track engagement, and predictive data
(e.g., eye-tracking) to reveal subconscious preferences. Prioritize
fixes using a structured matrix based on effort, impact, and urgency.

 HOW TO PICK THE PERFECT COLOR IN 30 SECONDS (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Warm colors (red, orange, yellow) feel physically closer. They're
ideal for high-urgency elements like "Buy Now" buttons, which
consistently outperform blue and other cold colors. Brighter colors
make objects seem larger, influencing choices like suitcase sizes in
e-commerce. Light backgrounds build transparency and trust, as
commonly seen in online banking UI, while dark backgrounds create
intimacy and exclusivity, as seen in luxury and adult-only websites. 

 HOW HE BUILT THE WORLD'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL SEO AGENCY (10 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Rob Hoffman's SEO agency gained traction after a viral case study on
an "SEO Heist" caught the attention of Google's CEO. Instead of
traditional sales tactics, it built an audience on LinkedIn and X,
using thought leadership to attract clients. Its client retention
strategy remains simple: make clients more money than they spend.
Contact Studios continues to scale by staying ahead of industry trends
and heavily investing in new SEO techniques. 

 HOW TO BUILD BRAND AWARENESS THROUGH PRODUCT IMPRESSIONS, NOT
MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Startups should prioritize product-led brand awareness over costly
traditional marketing. Companies like Notion, Figma, and SurveyMonkey
embed branding into their products with watermarks, “Powered by”
tags, and UGC, turning interactions into organic marketing. Freemium
models amplify this effect, but branding must be balanced to avoid
alienating users. While traditional brand marketing has its place,
early-stage companies should first leverage their product to drive
awareness before investing heavily in campaigns.
