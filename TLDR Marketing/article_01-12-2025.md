flat discounts. E-commerce sales rose to $11.8-$18 billion, yet online
order volume fell 1% as average selling prices increased 7%. AI was a
major winner as traffic to retail sites from AI sources grew 805% and

 HOW BIG TECH IS CREATING ITS OWN FRIENDLY MEDIA BUBBLE TO ‘WIN THE
NARRATIVE BATTLE ONLINE' (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Silicon Valley is building a friendly media ecosystem that lets tech
leaders shape their image at a time when public distrust is high. CEOs
now favor in-house outlets, pro-tech podcasts, and influencer-style
hosts who avoid tough questions. Firms like Andreessen Horowitz and
Palantir have launched their own publications and shows, while
creators like TBPN and Dwarkesh Patel offer upbeat platforms that
attract top executives. The result is less scrutiny and a curated
public image for tech elites.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO USE CHATGPT FOR SEO (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most still use ChatGPT to write blog posts, but it can replace tasks
that once required entire SEO teams. Prompt it to find blogs,
directories, and organizations for link-building, then generate
outreach templates in a brand's voice. Feed it reviews to create
on-brand, empathetic responses automatically. Import Search Console
data for plain-English performance summaries and suggested fixes.
Analyze competitors to map content gaps, create keyword clusters, and
build an E-E-A-T checklist. 

 HOW CLIO'S SEO DOMINANCE TRANSLATES INTO AI VISIBILITY (10 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Clio achieved AI search dominance through a decade of structured,
authoritative content targeting informational queries. Its approach
includes long-form blogs, detailed resources, and localized pages that
answer “what”, “how”, and “why” questions, with clear
formatting that AI can parse. It increases visibility with
high-quality backlinks from reputable organizations and builds trust
signals across the web.

 THE MARKET ENTRY TIMING EQUATION: WHEN BEING EARLY WINS AND WHEN IT
KILLS YOU (25 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Pioneers often fail, while early leaders who enter during the growth
phase tend to win. The T-Score framework turns timing into a
measurable decision by combining market readiness, defensibility, and
CAC volatility. Companies with low scores are too early and burn out,
mid-range scores rely on perfect execution, and high scores lead to
fast-follower dominance with efficient growth. The framework helps
founders cut guesswork and validate timing with data. 

 SUBVERTING THE AUTONOMOUS IMAGE (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI has created autonomous images that operate independently from
reality and human creative processes. Drawing on Debord's concept of
the Spectacle, these visuals reinforce existing social and economic
structures while presenting themselves as unquestionable and complete.
The black-box nature of the systems, the speed and scale of
production, and the resulting alienation from creation highlight the
shift in image autonomy. Techniques now exist to subvert or critically
engage with AI, using its mechanisms to expose biases and underlying
material and social conditions.
