 THE HIDDEN RULES OF TRULY GREAT A/B TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In experimentation, following conventional best practices will lead
to conventional results (or worse). To achieve truly exceptional
growth, marketers need to follow a different playbook.

In this hands-on session with Amplitude and DoWhatWorks [4], you'll
learn the counterintuitive practices that drive sustained impact.

Join to learn:

🥇 Why “proven” experimentation best practices can backfire,
especially in the age of AI

🧪 Counterintuitive experimentation practices you wouldn't expect,
and how user psychology makes them work

NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY MISCHIEF WILL DEFINE THE NEXT ERA OF ADVERTISING (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Mischief Marketing is emerging as a strategic response to ad fatigue.
By intentionally breaking rules and expectations, marketers are
creating campaigns that feel more exciting and fun. Burger King Brazil
hijacked Google Maps by uploading coupons to competitors' photo
galleries, reaching customers mid-search. Liquid Death leaned into
taboos with “Kegs for Pregs,” showing Kylie Kelce drinking from
water kegs while visibly pregnant. IKEA Canada texted customers “U
up?” between 10 pm and 5 am to promote sleep products, blending
flirtation with commerce. 

 HOLIDAY BROWSING SPIKES JUST 10 DAYS BEFORE BLACK FRIDAY (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 BFCM revenue patterns in 2024 show that the real spike in consumer
activity begins only 10 days before Black Friday. While brands often
plan for an extended ramp-up, data reveals minimal customer movement
in September and October. Instead, there is a sharp and fast climb in
browsing beginning mid-November. Product views increase during this
short window, but purchases lag behind until Black Friday hits, when
orders then surge and browsing drops. Cyber Week is the core revenue
period, and after this two-week stretch, both promotional activity and
customer engagement taper off quickly.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW I GOT RECALL.AI'S FIRST 100 CUSTOMERS FROM 2,000 COLD EMAILS (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This playbook outlines how Recall.ai defines a clear problem, builds
a targeted lead list, collects proof points, and enriches data
manually. Accounts are mapped to key personas, concise email copy is
sent, leads are sequenced and qualified, and lists are refined based
on responses. A simple data model, weekly cadence, and 14-day sprint
plan keep outreach efficient. 

 HOW KELLANOVA USES AI TO PREDICT CREATIVE PERFORMANCE AND DRIVE KPIS
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Kellanova, the marketer of Pringles, Cheez-It, and Pop-Tarts, built a
predictive scoring system that ties creative elements directly to
campaign performance. After analyzing over 443 assets across Meta
platforms and billions of impressions, the company identified 19
high-impact variables from more than 20,000 creative decisions. Top
performing ads featured branding in the first few seconds, positive
emotion, product consumption cues, characters, and overlays that
reinforced key messages. The system had 83% accuracy in predicting
view-through rates and an 11% lift in ROI.

 YOUR WEB TRAFFIC IS VANISHING. WHAT COMES NEXT? (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Web traffic gone? You're not imagining things. AI engines really are
changing how people find content — and most marketing teams are
struggling to adapt. Opticon Online [9] (October 21, free) [9] will be
a celebration of what's actually working: Generative Engine
Optimization, AI content workflows, and experimentation that moves the
needle. Join in-person (NYC / London) or virtually [9]. [9] 

 GPT-5 THINKING TIP (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ChatGPT introduced a new “GPT-5 Thinking” option that lets users
control how much reasoning the AI applies. Plus, Business/Teams, and
Pro accounts now see a dropdown to choose between Standard, which
balances speed and reasoning, and Extended, which is slower but
deeper. Pro users also get Light for faster output with less reasoning
and Heavy for the deepest reasoning at a slower pace. 

 GMAIL TABS FOR MARKETERS: HOW TO STAY VISIBLE IN 2025 (18 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Gmail's updates shift visibility from timing to engagement. Brands
need to separate transactional and promotional streams and remove
upsells from service messages to keep them in the right tab. They
should also make use of the expanded Manage Subscriptions by offering
preference centers, throttling low-engagers, and treating unsubscribes
as useful feedback. In the Promotions tab, visibility improves with
specific subject lines, clear CTAs, and consistent sender identity.
Tracking engagement speed, breadth, and persistence will now matter
more than just counting opens.

 INSIDE FYXER'S PATH FROM $1 TO $17 MILLION IN 8 MONTHS (7 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Fyxer scaled rapidly by blending consumer and enterprise strategies.
The product, built to simplify email for non-tech users, requires no
setup and rewards users for team invites. Growth started with direct
outreach to micro-influencers, followed by performance marketing
treated like a DTC brand with viral-style creative and a focus on work
email signups. Once enterprise potential was clear, pricing aligned
with professional use cases at $30-$50 per user, with seat-based
billing under review instead of usage-based models. As the AI
improved, Fyxer doubled down on reactivation, targeting early users
with founder-style emails and trial restarts to convince skeptics to
try again. 

 SCIENTIFICALLY AESTHETIC: FAKE SCIENCE IN FASHION MARKETING (2 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Fashion brands often use vague scientific and eco-friendly terms to
market products, but many of these claims lack substance and amount to
greenwashing. Luxury companies like Gucci and Prada have promoted
carbon-neutral or sustainable messaging, yet investigations revealed
that these promises often do not match their actual environmental
impact, leading Gucci to remove its carbon-neutral claim. The EU Green
Claims Directive will require verification before brands can use terms
like carbon neutral, eco-friendly, or net zero in campaigns. Despite
these regulations, mass production and fast fashion remain unchanged,
with companies relying on appealing but empty scientific language to
maintain prestige and consumer trust.
