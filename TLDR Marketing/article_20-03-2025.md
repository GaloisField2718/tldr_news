NEWS & TRENDS

 MANY DISCOVER PRODUCTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUT FEW PURCHASE (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 While 73% of shoppers discover products on social media, only 10% buy
directly on the platforms. Most customers opt for marketplaces or
retailer websites instead. Despite the trend, 37% of customers say
they are open to purchasing through social media which suggests the
hesitation may be due to trust and checkout friction.

READ) [6]

true to themselves, even if it's polarizing. 78% of CMOs feel that

audiences. There's also a growing focus on qualitative insights beyond
vanity metrics. 76.5% of brands are shifting budgets toward influencer
marketing, especially micro-influencers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CATEGORY LADDERS: HOW TO GET BUYERS TO THINK OF YOUR BRAND FIRST (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Buyers remember a shortlist of brands in any category, with more
familiar brands in high-interest categories like cars and fewer in
low-interest ones like batteries. To increase the chance of being
chosen in B2B, brands should associate themselves with specific
customer problems, define their category correctly to avoid confusion,
and maintain ongoing engagement to stay top of mind. Without
consistent marketing, even brands that make it onto a buyer's mental
“ladder” risk being forgotten before a purchase decision. Staying
relevant ensures that the brand is remembered when the need arises. 

 QUICK TIP FOR WEBINAR FOLLOW-UPS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 For webinar follow-ups, skip the generic "we missed you" emails and
long recordings. Instead, send a concise, actionable recap in text
format. A strong follow-up includes 3 key takeaways and 3 tactical
tips the recipient can apply immediately. Keep it brief and valuable,
something they can read in under a minute. This approach delivers real
value, even to those who didn't attend.

 PHYSICS X BRANDING (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Brands lose their uniqueness as they scale unless they invest in
maintaining differentiation. Starbucks and Nike dulled their
identities by prioritizing efficiency but are now working to regain
their edge. Guardrails, rooted in brand values, protect a brand's
distinctiveness by preserving elements that build long-term loyalty,
like Costco's $1.50 hotdog or HBO's creative freedom. Companies need
to identify these guardrails and protect them as brand investments,
not operational costs, to avoid becoming average and losing customer
loyalty. 

 LESSONS IN BRANDING FROM SEVERANCE: THE DARK ART OF LUMON'S CORPORATE
IDENTITY (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Severance's Lumon shows how branding shapes perception through
nostalgia, design, and psychology. Its retro corporate style, softened
logo, and Brutalist architecture create familiarity. Strategic color
usage, propaganda-like artwork, and hierarchical structures manipulate
employees and viewers. Food rituals and workplace design subtly
enforce authority. Lumon's branding embeds its identity into every
sensory element, proving that branding is much more than logos.

ensures accessibility without sacrificing power. Additionally,
Replit's hybrid pricing model mixes subscriptions with pay-as-you-go
credits, a strategy that maximizes value perception for customers and
revenue for the company.
