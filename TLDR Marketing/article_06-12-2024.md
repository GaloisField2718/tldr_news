NEWS & TRENDS

 PINTEREST PREDICTS 2025 (WEBSITE) [7] 

 Pinterest predicts that next year's trends will lean into bold forms
of expression and maximalism. Individuals will look for ways to stand
out and engage all their senses through their style choices. Nesting
parties will replace baby showers while travel shifts to remote
mountain destinations. Fashion trends will include coordinated outfits
and a fisherman aesthetic with cable-knit sweaters and sardine-themed
accessories. Food will highlight chaos cakes and pickle-inspired
creations, and home décor will embrace solar punk sustainability. 

 FOHR'S 6 BEAUTY PREDICTIONS FOR 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 2025 marks the death of the “influencer trip”. Brands will focus
on genuine relationship-building through intimate events with
influencers, press, and community members. Strategic casting and
transparency will replace scripted messaging for credibility. With
face product innovation slowing, growth will shift to fragrance, body
care, and wellness. Age inclusivity will gain traction, with terms
like “pro-aging” highlighting mature consumers' buying power.
Fragrance will continue expanding, and the influencer market will
evolve with older creators as CMOs allocate larger budgets to the
maturing segment.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO ANALYZE YOUR COMPANY TO FIND THE WINNING POSITIONING (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Marketers can learn from LEGO's turnaround by focusing on core
strengths and eliminating distractions. LEGO identified its key assets
- brand recognition, the LEGO System, and global distribution - while
cutting unprofitable ventures like video games and theme parks. It
leveraged its fan network for co-creation, streamlined its product
portfolio by 30%, and re-emphasized compatibility between sets to
reduce costs and boost customer loyalty. When a brand is struggling,
marketers should start by analyzing their company's capabilities,
assets, network, weaknesses, and strengths to uncover the right
positioning and path forward. 

 HOW TO CREATE THE RIGHT B2B OFFER (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Commoditized offers are easily compared with competitors, while
proprietary offers create differentiation through rare methods, unique
skills, or exclusive processes. Effective proprietary offers solve
high-priority problems and deliver clear outcomes, driving better
sales and customer loyalty. To create a proprietary offer, brands must
align it with a “big idea” narrative and focus on showcasing its
value instead of features or technical aspects. 

 6 STEPS TO REPAIR YOUR SENDER REPUTATION POST-BFCM (6 MINUTE READ)

deliverability over a three week period. To track the effectiveness of
the repair process, closely monitor metrics like spam complaints,
click rates, and unsubscribe rates.
