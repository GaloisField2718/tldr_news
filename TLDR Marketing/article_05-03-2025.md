NEWS & TRENDS

 GOODBYE CLICKS, HELLO AI: ZERO-CLICK SEARCH REDEFINES MARKETING (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Users are clicking through to websites less often as AI-generated
summaries are delivering answers directly on results pages. Brands
should optimize content for AI crawlability by prioritizing semantic
search and high-intent, long-tail terms while avoiding PDFs and gated
content to maintain visibility. Expanding content formats to include
video and interactive media can further enhance visibility. The
measure of success should shift from clicks to search impressions and
AI reach. 

 CREATOR AGENCY REPORT: 2024 TO 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Influencer marketing spending hit a record $24 billion in 2024, with
70% of U.S. brands investing or planning to invest in creators.
Short-form video dominated, and social media became the world's
largest advertising channel, surpassing paid search with $247.3
billion in global ad spend. Agencies played a crucial role, with 42%
of creator managers securing over $500K in brand deals and 47% of
agencies relying on 25 or fewer brand partners for their revenue. AI
and automation are reshaping talent management, while brands are
shifting focus from vanity metrics to engagement and brand alignment.
The creator economy is growing rapidly and M&A is accelerating as
agencies and brands scale their operations.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 UX TRICK TO BOOST SIGN-UPS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Lovable, an AI tool for no-code app creation, uses a UX trick to
boost sign-ups by making users feel the product is ungated. A
prominent chat box on the homepage invites visitors to enter a prompt,
building emotional investment. However, when they hit enter, a signup
pop-up appears, converting casual visitors into high-intent users.
While effective for increasing conversions, this tactic should be
tested before full implementation. 

 EXPAND RANKINGS TO LOOK BETTER (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Longer ranked lists (e.g., Top 20 instead of Top 5) make products
appear more desirable, leading to higher ratings, increased sales, and
willingness to pay more. In a study with 1,172 participants, people
were willing to pay 10.9% more for a top-ranked catering service on a
Top 20 list than on a Top 5 list. Eye-tracking showed people spent
40.9% more time looking at the top-ranked items in longer lists.
Products ranked highly in longer lists seem better because they appear
to have outperformed more competitors. This effect weakens when other
factors like cost, availability, or customization needs influence
decision-making. 

 HOW TO RUN A GIFTING CAMPAIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The head of growth at Default launched a $17,900 campaign that sent
100 champagne bottles to customers, prospects, partners, and
influencers - this generated an 11x ROI. The gift was thoughtfully
selected to match the brand, follow a clear theme, and create a
“wow” factor. Logistics were streamlined with a form that captured
addresses and synced with Salesforce. Recipients were contacted three
times before and after launch, resulting in 40+ demos and influencing
over $225K in open pipeline.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO WRITE WITH ACCESSIBLE LANGUAGE (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Readers spend an average of only 8.97 seconds on an email, making
accessible language critical for engagement. Best practices include
using concise copy, active voice, plain language, and structured
content to enhance readability for all audiences, including those with
cognitive disabilities or non-native speakers. Accessibility tools,
such as readability tests and screen reader previews, can help
marketers test emails to ensure they are clear, inclusive, and easy to
navigate. 

 META IS TESTING AI AGENTS THAT LET USERS ‘TALK' TO BUSINESSES (1
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Meta is piloting Business AI, an AI-powered tool that interacts with
users through voice or text to answer their questions. Designed like a
chatbot, it helps small businesses access AI without significant
investment. Business AI can handle inquiries about best-selling
products, available promotional codes, and more. It can be trained
using a brand's existing content, product catalog, and guidelines
while also being programmed to avoid certain topics.

 NETFLIX'S NEXT GROWTH HACK: TURNING VIEWERS INTO MARKETERS (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Netflix is expanding its 'Moments' feature, which lets users clip and
share parts of shows, potentially integrating it more deeply into the
platform. A new job listing suggests it may develop more
social-sharing tools to boost engagement and brand loyalty. Experts
speculate Netflix could leverage user-generated content and fandoms to
create an internal social ecosystem, similar to platforms like TikTok.
With its recent success in advertising and password-sharing
crackdowns, Netflix may see social engagement as its next major growth
strategy. 

 THE DEEP RESEARCH PROBLEM (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 There are several issues with OpenAI's Deep Research in terms of
accuracy and reliability. While it promises to streamline research,
the tool struggles with data retrieval. It uses unreliable sources
like Statcounter and Statista, leading to incorrect and inconsistent
results. The lack of precision in answering complex, probabilistic
questions makes it difficult to trust the output. It is unknown
whether AI systems will ever be accurate enough for dependable
research. 

 THE EVOLUTION OF LUXURY BRAND PORSCHE (19 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Porsche's brand strategy focuses on maintaining its sports car
heritage while scaling and expanding into broader segments, including
electric vehicles. Unlike traditional luxury brands like Ferrari,
Porsche operates at a higher production volume which requires a fine
balance between exclusivity and accessibility. Its recent “Track
Your Dream” initiative where customers have real-time visibility
into production represents a shift towards direct consumer engagement
to reduce dependency on dealerships and control the brand narrative.
