 HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR PRODUCT FEED ON PINTEREST (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Pinterest shares 4 tips on how to improve the performance of Pin
listings and create a more responsive in-app presence. It recommends
brands to include terms people use when searching for their products
in their product listings. Using a mixture of broad and exact words
and phrases will trigger more queries. Pinterest also advises tagging
products into multiple levels of categorization as it‚Äôll score more
highly in relevant searches and shopping categories. However, brands
should only list their products once in any given category. 

 INTERNAL LINKING IS CRITICAL TO UX (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Internal linking is important for SEO, but it also contributes to
good website UX. A poor linking architecture will lead to users
bouncing or feeling lost. Your website should make it easy for users
to continue their flow and should ensure messaging coherence along the
way. This post contains a framework for site structure and internal
linking for optimal UX and SEO. 

 3 AD IDEAS TO ENGAGE HIGH-INTENT PROSPECTS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post contains 3 retargeting ad formats meant for prospects who
have visited a high-intent page but haven't taken the next step. Say
exactly what they have in mind, plus your differentiator to get them
to take action. Show them a case study with real numbers so they can
visualize a tangible outcome. Mention what they'll get if they hop on
a call with you so they see the value in taking that step.

 13 THINGS TO REMOVE FROM YOUR WEBSITE IMMEDIATELY (17 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Generic navigation labels, like ‚ÄúProducts‚Äù and ‚ÄúSolutions,‚Äù
are unhelpful to users. Instead, make the labels specific and
descriptive so visitors know what you do and where to click. Homepage
slideshows are distracting and take visitors away from your one key
message. It‚Äôs more effective to make the top of the homepage simple
and descriptive. Brightly colored social icons on conversion pages are
distracting and illogical. Placing these icons in the footer is a
better option.

 THE 10 SYMPTOMS OF A BAD GROWTH TEAM (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This post outlines the indicators of a poorly run Growth function.
Chasing new users and revenue without considering churn or retention
is like filling a bucket with a giant hole at the bottom. Fixating on
‚Äòhacks‚Äô leads to desperate product experiences rather than a
sustainable and defensible growth engine. Focusing only on
quantitative data and choosing not to speak with customers will cap
your optimization opportunities. To cure these symptoms, leadership
must commit to a long-term strategy and invest in understanding the
company‚Äôs unique growth needs. 

 CREATING POSITIVE FRICTION IN THE USER JOURNEY (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Positive friction is adding both value and effort to a user‚Äôs
experience at the same time. It can contribute to user retention and
engagement. For instance, Duolingo's experiments with streak screens
and additional clicks resulted in both short-term and long-term
retention gains. Other positive friction examples include fitness apps
Rise and Loona using extensive onboarding flows to enhance
personalization and increase their perceived product value.
