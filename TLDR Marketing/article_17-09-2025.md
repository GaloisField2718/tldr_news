 ONLINE BRANDS ONLY TARGETING HEAVY BUYERS ARE MISSING OUT, SAYS STUDY
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 New research finds that about 50% of online sales come from light
buyers, while the heaviest 20% of buyers also contribute about half.
Around 70% of sales come from customers who purchase more than the
average, but the contribution of frequent buyers is closer to 50-70%
of total sales rather than 80-90%. This challenges the idea that
focusing on heavy buyers or customers further along the funnel is the
best strategy. The research shows that brands should target a wide
range of buyers to drive growth in the $8 trillion global e-commerce
market expected by 2025. 

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES NEW PROTOCOL FOR AGENT-DRIVEN PURCHASES (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Google just launched AP2, a new open protocol for AI-powered agent
shopping backed by more than 60 merchants and financial firms,
including Mastercard and PayPal. It enables bots to handle
transactions while preserving user consent and traceability. This sets
the basis for a future where consumers can say “book my trip” and
agents negotiate bundles, compare rates, and complete the purchase
within defined approval structures. Marketers should prioritize
agent-readiness in their checkout and bundling strategies, especially
for high-intent multi-item journeys.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR LOGO SHOULD SHOW WHAT YOU DO (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Logos that clearly show what a company does make people view the
brand as more authentic, positive, and trustworthy. Across 7
experiments with 4,149 people, brands with descriptive logos were
rated up to 27.7% more authentic and 18.7% more positive, and people
said they were more likely to buy from 174 real UK startups with such
logos. The effect is strongest for new or unfamiliar brands, but it
can backfire for undesirable products like lice shampoo. Descriptive
logos work because they are easier to process, help people quickly
understand the brand, and create associations that make the company
seem honest and transparent. 

 HOW TO WRITE A HERO (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Creating a clear above-the-fold section on a homepage starts with
selecting a reference point familiar to target customers, such as a
product category, use case, or competitor. Then explain
differentiation, showing why your solution is better within the
category, more effective for the workflow, or a superior alternative.
The challenge is choosing the right reference and prioritizing
segments, since not all points resonate with every audience. 

 HOW TO GET 4X MORE LEADS FROM YOUR CONTENT–WITHOUT FORMS OR GATES
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Capturing leads with forms creates a tradeoff. Gate content and you
frustrate prospects, un-gate it and you lose visibility. Since only
about 3% of an audience is ready to buy, while 97% are still
researching, gating often blocks the majority from engaging. A better
path is a contact-based marketing system that tracks behavior without
forms. Install identification tools like Clearbit or 6sense, set up
CRM attribution, and tag assets with UTMs. Then map content to intent
stages, monitor user journeys, and trigger tailored follow-ups and ads
based on high-intent signals.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 MOCHA (TOOL) [10] 

 Mocha is a no-code platform that lets non-technical users build
full-stack web apps by describing what they want in natural language.
It handles everything in one place (i.e., design, frontend, backend,
database, authentication, hosting, and payments), so you don't need to
stitch together multiple tools. 

 GURU 2025 (VIRTUAL CONFERENCE) [11] 

 The world's largest free virtual email marketing conference is taking
place on November 6-7. It will feature 2 days of expert-led virtual
sessions covering the latest digital trends, email best practices, and
emerging tools. Attendees will hear from high-profile speakers ranging

 AD CREATIVE FATIGUE: WHAT IT IS AND HOW TO PREVENT IT (8 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Creative fatigue happens when Meta detects declining results due to
overexposure. It's not inevitable and is often caused by small,
fixable issues like one-ad sets or narrow placements. It is easy to
prevent it by using Advantage+ placements, offering five or more text
and headline variations, and customizing creative by placement.
Fatigue sets in when people see the same thing too many times in
similar spots. The more variation built in the campaign, the longer it
can stay efficient without causing fatigue. 

 WHY COLD EMAILS DON'T WORK (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A review of 756 cold emails collected over 6 months shows the
majority follow ineffective patterns. Most use shallow
personalization, misleading subject lines, and weak calls to action.
Only 13% had a clear next step, and less than 40% included any link.
Repeated follow-ups and irrelevant offers created more frustration
than anything else. For marketers, the lesson is to focus on
permission-based engagement and content to build trust before sending
the first pitch.
