operations next year. 

 WHY BRAND MARKETING IN 2024 MAY RECLAIM ITS GLORY DAYS (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Fashion companies are set to revive brand marketing in 2024, steering
away from the dominance of performance marketing. With increased
privacy regulations and higher costs, 72% of fashion marketers plan to

an increase in storytelling and emotional affinity, and a focus on
cross-funnel strategies in developing long-term brand stories.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW HUBSPOT DELIGHTS THEIR CUSTOMERS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 HubSpot uses a Hierarchy of Customer Delight framework to ensure it
meets its users‚Äô needs. Survival and support are at the
foundation‚Äîit‚Äôs making sure the product works and providing
support if something goes wrong. The next level is community and
making customers feel seen and heard. The highest level of the
hierarchy is understanding what motivates your biggest fans and
enabling them to become even better versions of themselves. For
example, HubSpot enables passionate customers to "become their final
form" by having them teach boot camps for HubSpot Academy. 

 HOW TO PRICE A NEW PRODUCT WITH VALUE WALKS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Companies often leave money on the table by setting prices solely
based on costs. An alternative to that is to use Value-Based pricing,
where the price is set by the value to the end customer. 'Value Walks'
is a method to define the price based on how much customers value your
product. Starting from the price of the next best alternative (NBA),
you can add or remove a certain dollar amount depending if your
features are better or worse than the NBA.

 HOW TO BUILD AN EFFECTIVE TRIAL FOR YOUR PRODUCT (5 MINUTE READ) [14]

B2B products vary.
