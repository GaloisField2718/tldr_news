 FORGET CELEBRITIES AND INFLUENCERS. GET UP TO 10X ROAS BY FEATURING
TOP TIER TV SHOWS IN YOUR ADS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 ✨ Brands using MutualMarkets [4] are seeing major CTR and ROAS
uplifts by integrating the IP from the TV shows their audiences
already love, directly into their advertising — e.g., featuring
Emily in Paris or Justin Hartley from Tracker in your digital or paid
social ads.

💡 WHY  INTEGRATING TV IP INTO YOUR ADS IS SMARTER:

 	* ICONIC: With so many ads competing for attention, recognizable
logos and TV characters will differentiate your creative.
 	* RELIABLE: Influencers can be flaky. Associating your brand with a
trusted TV show ensures a more predictable partnership.
 	* AUTHENTIC: TV integrations feel natural, while influencer
campaigns often seem inauthentic.

citing national security concerns over China's influence. TikTok faces

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE "HOLY ****" MOMENT HACK NO MARKETER IS USING (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Showcasing authentic first-time reactions to your products creates
powerful emotional connections. Genuine customer reactions can trigger
similar excitement in others, making them effective tools. Use raw
footage across websites, social media, and campaigns, emphasizing
moments that contrast expectations with reality or highlight
personalized surprises. Avoid scripted or fake reactions, as
authenticity builds trust and social proof. 

 YOUR B2B MARKETING WEBSITE IS AN EXTENSION OF YOUR PRODUCT, NOT JUST
A PIECE OF BRANDING COLLATERAL (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Websites are not just a branding tool, they're part of the product
experience. Focus on performance metrics like new user acquisition,
prospect-to-signup conversion rates, and traffic quality rather than
just aesthetics. Optimize key pages like the homepage and pricing page
for action, which is possible with tools like personalization and
ungated freemium access. Avoid relying on rebranding as a primary
strategy since it often hurts performance metrics.

 PERPLEXITY EXPANDS ITS PUBLISHER PROGRAM (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Perplexity has expanded its publisher program, partnering with
outlets like LA Times, Adweek, and Lee Enterprises to share ad revenue
and provide performance metrics. Publishers such as The New York Times
and Dow Jones have criticized Perplexity's alleged unauthorized
content use, with lawsuits labeling its practices a "content
kleptocracy." Perplexity also faces backlash for summarizing paywalled
content inaccurately and maintaining confidential program terms,
unlike OpenAI's more transparent approach.

 MARKETING'S $100 BILLION DOLLAR MISTAKE: FRAUD IN DIGITAL CHANNELS (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Ad fraud causes over $100 billion in losses annually, with more than
20% of programmatic ad spend affected and mobile ad fraud rates
exceeding 30%. Fraudulent practices, including click farms, fake
installs, and misleading impressions, inflate top-of-funnel metrics
without real conversions. Marketers often unknowingly optimize
campaigns based on false signals instead of scrutinizing the data to
identify and address these issues.
