 DEI PUSHBACK AFFECTS LGBTQ+ MARKETING: HERE'S WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 62% of consumers support brands speaking on social issues, yet only
46% can define DEI, and 18% think it pushes an agenda. LGBTQ+
consumers, with $3.9 trillion in global buying power, have higher
expectations, with 61% wanting brands to share commitments compared to
35% of the general population. Perceived LGBTQ+ representation in ads
has fallen from 73% in 2023 to 65% in 2025. Scaling back DEI reduces
trust for 41% of consumers and impacts purchasing for 39%, especially
among younger and LGBTQ+ audiences.

of menus highlight protein, up from 5.9% a decade ago, and this could
exceed 40% by 2029. Driven by health-conscious consumers, including
younger generations and those using weight-loss drugs like GLP-1,

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TRUSTWORTHY SMILES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Using a genuine smile in a profile picture can increase
approachability and reduce perceived risk, leading to more sales.
Consistently using the same photo across platforms leverages
Familiarity Bias, making people more likely to trust and choose you.
Research shows people make judgments about trust in milliseconds based
on facial cues like an upturned mouth and slightly raised eyebrows.
One study found people invested up to 42% more in strangers with
trustworthy features. 

 FIRST YOU NEED AN SEO STRATEGY, NOT A GEO TOOL (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI will not kill SEO, but it will force it to evolve. Many marketers
are wrongly chasing AI visibility tools instead of building strategies
around user intent. SEO's purpose is to help people find answers,
products, and services across any platform, whether it is a search
engine or an AI agent. Ranking in AI responses is brand marketing and
not a substitute for technical SEO and content that drives customers.
The mentality needs to shift from gaming algorithms to optimizing for
user needs and structured content that works across AI-driven search
environments.

 VUORI'S MARKETING STRATEGY: FINDING LULULEMON'S GAP (3 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Vuori grew from a garage startup to a $5.5B brand in under 10 years
by focusing on the overlooked men's premium activewear market. Rather
than highlighting technical specs, it prioritized comfort and
versatility, with fabrics like DreamKnit and BlissBlend driving
word-of-mouth. A hybrid distribution model with partners like REI,
Nordstrom, and Equinox built credibility and expanded reach while
maintaining a premium image. Its success stems from redefining the
category through cultural relevance, product innovation, and insight
into how people want to live.

and were more accurate in groups than alone.
