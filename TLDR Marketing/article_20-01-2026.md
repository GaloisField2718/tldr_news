NEWS & TRENDS

 DEBUNKING THE MYTH THAT SEARCH IS DYING (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Analysis of 40,000 major sites shows organic search traffic declined
only slightly by 2.5% YoY, with top sites and certain categories even
growing. Claims that AI or LLMs are replacing search or drastically
reducing clicks are based on flawed surveys, small samples, or
anecdotal evidence. Large-scale panel data confirms that Google and
other search engines still drive the vast majority of traffic, and AI
Overviews affect clicks less often than assumed. 

 TOP BRANDING & DESIGN TRENDS FOR 2026 (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Brands now focus on human connection. Personal branding has moved
from performative visibility to unique voices and audience
collaboration on owned platforms. Visual identities are becoming
adaptive and sensory. They are embracing tactile textures, playful
typography, and experiences that engage both feeling and sight. 

🚀 

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO OVERCOME THE “LINK IN COMMENTS” PROBLEM ON LINKEDIN AND
OTHER SOCIAL PLATFORMS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LinkedIn actively demotes posts and comments that contain links,
making it harder to drive traffic externally. Use implied links by
creating engaging content that sparks curiosity so interested users
seek out your site on their own. Another approach is placing links in
comments without explicitly calling them out and pairing them with
compelling, engagement-worthy text to push the comment to the top. A
third tactic is having others post or amplify the comment to increase
visibility. 

 UNIT ECONOMICS: THE OVERLOOKED REASON EVEN ‘PERFECTLY OPTIMIZED'
GOOGLE ADS CAMPAIGNS FAIL (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google Ads campaigns can fail even when optimized because poor unit
economics make profitable scaling impossible. Strong PPC tactics
cannot overcome weak margins or low LTV. Unit economics set limits on
CPCs, CPA targets, auction competitiveness, and growth. One ecommerce
brand saw ROAS fall from 1,000% to 700% as CPCs rose, and the fix
required raising AOV and improving LTV rather than changing campaigns.
In another case, a supplements brand scaled spend to £26K per month
and acquired 430 subscriptions at a £123 CPA because each customer
had a £309 LTV, which made aggressive bidding profitable.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE GREAT DECOUPLING (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 SEO traffic no longer predicts pipeline because AI answers remove
clicks while buyer intent remains. Short-head keyword volume grew only
1.2% in the last 12 months and is forecast to fall 0.74% in the next
12 months as demand shifts to long tail queries and AI interfaces.
Pipeline can grow far faster than traffic, such as 32% traffic growth
paired with 75% signup growth or pipeline growing 2.3x faster while
traffic stays flat. SEO now drives brand influence by helping AI
systems understand trust and cite a brand, which lifts demos even when
site visits fall. 

 HOW TO MEASURE BRAND'S IMPACT ON B2B PIPELINE (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Most B2B leaders believe brand drives demand, yet few can prove its
impact because traditional attribution models undervalue how brands
actually work. Brands rarely create immediate clicks or conversions.
It builds mental availability that later shows up through search,
trust, and preference. Measuring incrementality by asking what would
have happened without the investment puts brand and demand on equal
footing and reveals its true impact on pipeline and efficiency.
