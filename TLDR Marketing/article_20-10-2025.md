NEWS & TRENDS

 IS AI ADOPTION SLOWING DOWN? (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI adoption is slowing outside tech and finance as businesses focus
on scaling existing use cases. Retention is improving, but
monetization pressures push companies toward last-resort strategies
like social apps or niche content. In hiring, AI creates friction as
candidates and employers battle automated resume scans. Growth for
attention-driven channels like podcasts remains difficult because
episodes rarely go viral. Listeners are highly selective, and
discoverability outside major platforms is limited. 

 HOW TODAY'S CONSUMERS ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME AND MONEY (11 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Consumers are paradoxically frugal and indulgent. They downsize
purchases to afford lifestyle splurges, a behavior led by Gen Z. This
group values experience-rich products and uses AI tools but distrusts
influencer-driven content. Brands should deliver value in smaller
formats and support self-expression. Rising mistrust in digital
sources pushes companies to rethink social spend and invest in
physical presence and trusted media. Targeting Gen Z requires focusing
on micro-moments, personalized wellness, and functional splurges that
outperform legacy signals like “organic” or “natural.”

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TWO GROWTH TACTICS THAT'LL DEFINE B2B IN 2026 (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The growth playbook is shifting as social fatigue, AI, and short-form
content change engagement. Startups should prioritize human connection
with small-scale initiatives like curated chats or local events.
Strong branding and consistent storytelling will differentiate
companies as barriers to entry fall. Employee-led content, podcasts,
and events put faces at the forefront, while attribution becomes
harder, making a full-funnel approach essential. 

 THE SPONSORED POST WITH 57M VIEWS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Dr. Squatch ad, disguised as a short film, delivered more than
835K shares and 7.9M likes by ditching traditional ad cues. With 99%
of TikTok views from non-followers, the campaign demonstrates that
narrative-first, creator-led content drives broader reach and deeper
impact. The key is to start with a familiar hook, then deliver
something unexpected. Brands willing to trust creative partners and
invest in storytelling will see stronger engagement across channels.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 GOOGLE SHOPPING SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR PHYSICAL GOODS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google Shopping subscriptions let US merchants sell physical goods on
repeat, turning one-time buyers into loyal customers. Setup involves
updating product feeds in Merchant Center and enabling subscriptions
in Google Ads. Success relies on high-use products, discounts,
personalized bundles, churn tracking, and clear terms. 

 “DEAL CARDS” IN GMAIL PROMOTIONS TAB (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google is introducing "Deal Cards" in the Gmail Promotions tab,
auto-generated summaries that highlight key offer details at the top
of promotional emails. This feature increases visibility, reduces
friction with at-a-glance deal info and copyable codes, and boosts
engagement through actionable buttons. Powered by schema.org markup,
Deal Cards reward brands that use structured, machine-readable data,
reflecting the broader trend of the inbox becoming a more app-like,
interactive space. Rollout will be gradual and vary by region and
language.

 CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY MARKETING STRATEGY: WHEN SELLING NOTHING SELLS
EVERYTHING (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Cards Against Humanity built its success by turning anti-marketing
into strategy. Known for absurd Black Friday stunts like selling bull
excrement or charging people for nothing, the brand exposed the
ridiculousness of consumerism while making buyers feel part of the
joke. Its audience of educated, irreverent millennials and Gen Zers
values the self-aware humor and social critique behind the chaos. 

 WHY INCREMENTALITY IS THE ONLY METRIC THAT PROVES MARKETING'S REAL
IMPACT (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Incrementality testing measures what marketing actually causes, not
what just gets credit. Metrics like ROAS and CTR often exaggerate
performance by counting conversions that would happen anyway.
Incrementality compares exposed and unexposed audiences to show
whether campaigns create new demand or capture existing intent.
Methods such as holdouts, causal modeling, and MMM quantify this
across channels. With built-in lift tools from Meta, Google, and
TikTok, teams can now measure impact directly and see which efforts
drive real growth.
