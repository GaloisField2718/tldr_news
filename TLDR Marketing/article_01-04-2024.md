NEWS & TRENDS

 ADVERTISERS SUE META FOR ALLEGEDLY INFLATING AD VIEWERSHIP IN $7
BILLION LAWSUIT (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Advertisers have filed a class-action lawsuit against Meta, alleging
the company inflated ad viewership figures by up to 400%. They claim
to have been unfairly charged inflated premiums for ad placements on
Facebook and Instagram. 

 SEEING FEWER CUSTOMERS, FAST-FOOD COMPANIES TURN TO LOYALTY APPS (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Food prices in the US rose a record-breaking 20% from January 2021 to
January 2024. This has contributed to budget-conscious diners cutting
back. Instead of across-the-board menu slashes and broad discounts,
chains are limiting them to specific meal times or channels. Wendy‚Äôs
introduced a limited-time $1 burger available exclusively via its app.
Domino‚Äôs halved the minimum purchase price to get points in its
loyalty program. 

 THE ‚ÄòZERO‚Äô-LABEL: GAMING OUR GUILT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ‚ÄòZero‚Äô has become a popular marketing slogan. Think ‚Äúzero
sugar‚Äù, ‚Äúzero emissions‚Äù, or ‚Äúzero landfill‚Äù. Zero-based
marketing focuses on what products lack rather than their attributes,
exploiting societal guilt over past consumption habits. This trend
leverages consumer guilt to drive sales and promote eco-conscious
purchasing behaviors.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE KITKAT METHOD TO WINNING 'TOP-OF-MIND' AWARENESS (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 KitKat's strategy is to make its product synonymous with having a
break. The brand has done so with billboards, targeting specific
search keywords like ‚ÄòI hate Mondays‚Äô and placing public benches
shaped like KitKat bars. Other brands can use this method by
pinpointing the exact moment in a customer's day when its product or
service is most relevant. From there, it‚Äôs a matter of creating a
moment-prompting slogan and putting the product in those everyday
places to make it easy for people to choose it when that moment
strikes. 

 HOW READING PATTERNS CAN HELP US OPTIMIZE CONTENT FOR ORGANIC SEARCH
(6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Reading patterns are a user experience concept that can create more
helpful content for readers. The F Pattern describes how users read
opening lines and skim the rest of the content. Using subheadings and
images will attract their eyes. The Layer Cake describes when users
focus mainly on the headings to understand the structure. It‚Äôs
important to build in headings and subheadings. Some users skim the
content looking for particular keywords ‚Äî adding important keywords
in strategic places will keep them reading. 

 SITE NAVIGATION: WHY IT MATTERS FOR NEWS SEO (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Site navigation has a pivotal role in enhancing visibility and
engagement. Robust navigation not only aids readers in exploring a
publication's content but also assists search engines in comprehending
its topical focus and depth of coverage. To build great navigation,
identify the most important landing pages of your site. Order these
pages from most to least important. Then experiment with adding a
sub-navigation that pulls in tag pages for important topics or other
links. This piece covers good navigation examples from The New York
Times, CNN, and The Washington Post.

 HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE YOUR BRAND BY IGNORING BEST PRACTICES (5 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Rather than following the typical retail electronics strategy, Apple
pulled inspiration from museums and luxury brands to create the Apple
Store concept. This presented its products as simple and premium,
resulting in $1 billion in sales within 3 years. Cross-industry
innovation is a problem-solving method to come up with unique ideas by
using what‚Äôs been done in other industries. To do this effectively,
clarify the exact problem you need to solve. This helps identify the
right inspiration from other industries. 

 HOW BRANDS ARE THINKING ABOUT A POSSIBLE TIKTOK BAN (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Brands like Duolingo, Osea Malibu, and Truff are strategizing to
transition to alternative short-form video platforms. They are
investing in Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts as contingency plans
to continue engaging with their audience. Despite having alternatives,
not all TikTok content would transfer well, requiring adapting content
and format. Use your current customers and fans as the North Star in
terms of platform of choice and content.
