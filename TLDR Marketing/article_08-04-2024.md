 ROKU PATENT INVENTS A WAY TO SHOW ADS OVER ANYTHING YOU PLUG INTO
YOUR TV (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Roku filed a patent for a system that could extend ad placement
beyond its platform. Ads would be displayed over content paused on
external devices connected to Roku TVs. This technology, still in the
patent stage, proposes detecting static or paused video content and
overlaying relevant ads. This potentially opens up new advertising
opportunities and revenue streams for Roku. 

 IAB: WHY THE RISE OF CONTENT CREATORS SIGNALS A NEW ERA OF INFLUENCE
(4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 No one wants to be ‚Äòinfluenced‚Äô when they‚Äôre scrolling through
social media. People want to be spoken to, inspired, educated, and
entertained. It‚Äôs the creators and communities people choose to
engage with, not the big brands or big influencers. The beauty in
creator marketing is when brands hand the control over to the creator
themselves and see how they interpret it. Brand guidelines shouldn‚Äôt
completely be cast aside though. Creator briefs are still relevant and
should serve as ‚Äúfreedom within a framework‚Äù.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE PAY MORE WITH THE ART OF ‚ÄòVISIBLE LABOR‚Äô (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 People perceive products that involve visible effort as having more
value. By showcasing the effort in the production process, marketers
can justify higher prices and loading times. This article shares
tactics to leverage this psychological effect such as offering a
behind-the-scenes look to explain how the product works and adding a
bit of theatrical delay while processing the customer requests. 

 3 CUSTOMER QUESTIONS TO UNLOCK GROWTH (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Speaking with your customers directly can uncover a goldmine of
growth opportunities. It‚Äôs critical to ask follow-up questions to
further clarify the meaning of what a customer said, rather than
making assumptions. It‚Äôs also a best practice to end an interview
with an open-ended prompt. This allows customers to discuss what
matters most to them and ends the interview on a positive note. 

 CANVA‚ÄôS EFFECTIVE CANCELLATION FLOW (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A breakdown of how Canva kept a user from canceling their premium
account. Canva turned a price increase into a marketing tactic by
reminding the user that even though prices have increased to
$29.99/month, they only have to continue paying $12.95/month. The
brand also created loss aversion by reminding the user of the number
of times they‚Äôve used premium features. Lastly, Canva added a
‚ÄúContinue cancellation‚Äù CTA in a bright red button. Clever UX
choice there, as people tend to not click on big red buttons.

 MESSAGING: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEATURES, CAPABILITIES, AND
BENEFITS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Features, capabilities, and benefits are the most important concepts
in messaging, but most people only distinguish between features and
benefits. A capability is what you do with the product, while a
benefit is the outcome of using that capability. This post uses
Slack's messaging for its channels feature to illustrate these
concepts.

INDUSTRY CONCERNS (6 MINUTE READ) [11]
