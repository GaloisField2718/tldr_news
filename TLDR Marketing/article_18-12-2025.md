 YOUR CEO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ENGAGEMENT. CONNECT MARKETING EFFORT TO
REVENUE WITH ASANA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Marketers everywhere are feeling the pressure: launch more campaigns,
ship them faster, do it all with fewer resources -- and prove that
you're actually moving the needle on revenue.

If you need a moment for a primal scream, that's understandable. But
here's the good news: There's a way to do more with less, and it's

 25 BIG IDEAS THAT WILL DEFINE 2026 (24 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In 2026, AI will shift from better models to better workflows,
governance, and security. AI fluency will become a baseline skill, and
“AI Whispering” will emerge as the next hot liberal arts major.
Creators will scale into lean media businesses as newsletters, email
monetization, and owned audiences outperform social platforms. Health
trends will focus on longevity, women's care, and biometrics.
Economically, stablecoins will expand payments, data centers will
drive land and energy races, and space investment will accelerate.
Culturally, people will push back on screens through offline
community, human-first retail, and social video moving to TVs. 

 ADVERTISING, SUBSCRIPTIONS, OR REFORM: HOW THE BBC COULD BE FUNDED
AFTER 2027 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The BBC's potential shift toward advertising could reshape how
revenue flows across the UK advertising and digital media markets.
Advertising is unlikely to replace the licence fee, which delivered
£3.8bn of its £5.9bn revenue in 2024/25, and adding BBC inventory
would increase supply in a market where broadcaster ad share has
fallen from 15.8% in 2003 to a forecast 5% next year. That influx
would likely divert spend from existing broadcasters and digital
publishers rather than create new demand. The decision will influence
how large public media organizations balance trust, scale, and
sustainability as audiences move toward platform and subscription-led
media.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WIN REPORT: ASK FOR LESS, GET (28%) MORE (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Lowering CTA commitment to match visitor readiness increased
transactions by 28% for it. Visitors were often stressed and early in
research, yet the site pushed high-commitment actions too soon, which
reduced clicks and confidence. Replacing early Buy Now style CTAs with
exploratory steps increased product page visits by 9.7% and moved more
users deeper into the funnel. The test showed that clear progression
and smaller commitments increase movement and sales without delaying
purchase decisions. 

 THE BEST GROWTH TACTICS OF 2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The most cited themes were outbound and ABM (20%), partner ecosystems
(20%), and events (16%). Tactics ranged from automated LinkedIn
outreach and personalized demos to partner-led co-marketing and
executive-led intros. Community activations, including webinars and
intimate events, emerged as conversion drivers. Content-led strategies
emphasized AI discovery and answer engine optimization through LLM
visibility. Product-led growth and onboarding flows contributed
materially to revenue outcomes, particularly when mapped to ICP
behavior.

 INTRODUCING INSTAGRAM FOR TV (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Instagram is testing Instagram for TV, a new app that brings Reels to
the big screen for shared viewing. Available in the US on Amazon Fire
TV, the experience organizes Reels into interest-based channels like
music, sports, travel, and trending moments, with autoplay and full
sound for lean-back watching. Users can add up to 5 accounts for
personalized feeds and search for creators or topics. 

 WHY CLICK-BASED ATTRIBUTION SHOULDN'T ANCHOR EXECUTIVE DASHBOARDS (8
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Click-based attribution remains popular because it provides clear,
deterministic outputs that are simple to interpret. However, these
models do not account for untracked influences such as video, social
exposure, or thought leadership content that shape perception and
intent. As a result, executive dashboards dominated by click metrics
can create bias toward activities that generate visible conversions at
the expense of long-term demand generation. This focus may impact
investment in brand building and creative impact while prioritizing
only short-term returns.

 HOW LANGUAGE HAS BECOME THE NEW METRIC OF VIRALITY (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Virality is increasingly shaped by how language evolves through
algorithmic exposure. Slang terms that once remained localized now
spread rapidly across global platforms optimized for engagement and
trend replication. Expressions tied to identity, humor, or community
affiliation gain traction based on metadata and usage frequency. These
shifts influence how audiences communicate, interpret meaning, and
assign cultural relevance to content. 

 THERE'S A REASON WOMEN AREN'T SWOONING OVER AI LIKE MEN ARE (7 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Women are less likely to use AI, not due to a lack of skill, but
because their caution reflects real risks. Studies show women have 22%
lower odds of using AI websites and apps than men, both at work and in
everyday life. Many first encountered AI through harms like sexual
deepfakes, which are 90% female-targeted, or through biased systems
that disadvantage women in hiring, pay, healthcare, and justice. Women
also face a double penalty, with AI use lowering perceived competence
by 13% versus 6% for men. 

 5 MARKETING LESSONS HIDING INSIDE DISNEY'S MERCHANDISING ENGINE (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While performance across film, parks, and streaming shows signs of
decline, Disney's merchandising continues to grow. Its approach
focuses on acquiring and amplifying existing franchises through
partner channels and collaborations. This reduces the need for
original audience building and enhances brand reach. Familiarity
remains a core tactic, allowing consumers to quickly categorize and
engage with products. The model is effective when it maintains
simplicity, trust, and alignment with established consumer behavior.
