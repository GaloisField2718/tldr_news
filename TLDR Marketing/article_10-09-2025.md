NEWS & TRENDS

 FACEBOOK AD COSTS JUMP 21% IN 2025, BUT STILL BEAT GOOGLE (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Facebook ads are getting more expensive for leads but cheaper for
clicks. Cost per lead now averages $27.66, while CPC fell to $0.70.
Traffic campaigns saw stronger engagement, making them a better ROI
play in 2025. However, lead generation is under pressure with lower
conversion rates. For marketers, this means tighter audience
targeting, refreshed creative, and smarter funnel planning are
essential for good ROI. 

 THE NEXT GENERATION OF CREATIVITY: A MAXIMALIST MOMENT RESHAPING
CULTURE (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Gen Z (14-24) is redefining media with Creative Maximalism, a
participatory, visually complex, and internet-referential style shaped
by platforms like YouTube, Minecraft, and Roblox. Teens spend 26% less
time on TV and movies and 54% more time on social platforms and
user-generated content than older audiences. 66% believe their
generation has a big impact on online culture. They favor co-creation,
immersive audiovisual storytelling, and content influenced by digital
cultures.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 5 SMART ECOMMERCE RETARGETING STRATEGIES TO RECOVER LOST SALES (17
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most e-commerce retargeting focuses too much on coupons, but buyers
often abandon carts for reasons unrelated to price. Marketers should
align messaging to each stage of the funnel. Cart abandoners may need
social proof or urgency, while browsers need education or reminders.
Use dynamic ads segmented by behavior and predicted value. A/B testing
formats like SKU clusters versus single product reminders can
significantly improve ROAS. 

 LINKEDIN ADS: MAX DELIVERY VS. MANUAL BIDDING (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Test manual bidding on LinkedIn Ads instead of max delivery. In
repeated campaigns, switching drove a 65.5% increase in clicks and
52.7% more impressions on the same budget, with only minor shifts in
audience mix. Manual bidding helps stretch spend further and reach
more new buyers, which is key for growth. However, keep in mind that
chasing the lowest CPC/CPM can limit access to higher-value audiences.

search campaigns achieved a 1.9x purchase lift and higher incremental
ROAS compared to non-search campaigns. TikTok searches are rising
sharply, up 40% year over year, with 86% of Gen Z internet users
searching on the platform weekly. Aerie demonstrated the impact of

 THE FUNNEL HASN'T COLLAPSED, IT'S COMPRESSED (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Social commerce has compressed into a single scroll. Platforms like
TikTok and Amazon collapsed discovery, intent, and purchase into one
swipe. This isn't the death of the funnel but its evolution, where
mental states still matter, only processed faster and often
simultaneously. The risk is that brands overinvest in visible
conversions while neglecting memory-building, even though long-term
growth still depends on penetration and brand availability. The real
challenge is balancing speed with stickiness so brands aren't
forgotten when discovery and purchase happen in seconds. 

 HOW CONTENT LABELS INCREASE CLICKS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Researchers found that content labels such as “most read” and
“most shared” significantly affect click behavior. Across 5
experiments, 2 surveys, and 36,679 ad clicks, people perceived “most
read” content as 18.4% more informative, while “most shared” was
seen as 32.5% more entertaining. When searching for information,
people clicked 23.9% more on articles labeled “most read” and were
67.9% more willing to read them compared to “most shared.” For
entertaining content, “most shared” labels drove higher clicks,
showing that labeling content with the right signal can increase
engagement.
