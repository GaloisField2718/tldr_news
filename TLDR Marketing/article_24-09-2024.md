NEWS & TRENDS

 MARKETING INDUSTRY NEEDS TO PLAY ITS PART IN HEALING DIVISIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Society is increasingly divided, with 47% of the UK and 49% of the US
concerned about societal breakdown. Gaps persist in the representation
of the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, and older adults in
advertising. Active inclusion, where diverse characters are portrayed
with respect and nuance, has been shown to drive both short-term sales
and long-term brand equity. Brands are encouraged to lead with
empathy, enrich their storytelling, and address broader issues such as
climate change, food security, and societal divisions.

sync with its sonic brand to enhance customer trust during
transactions. This innovation addresses shoppers' uncertainty at

numerous assets. Lincoln Literacy transformed a 30-minute interview
into multiple unpaid channel engagements, including PR features,

 EXPOSING WHY SEARCH DOESN'T SPEND NEXT TO PMAX (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Running Search campaigns alongside Performance Max (pMax) can lead to
reduced Search performance. Search Themes can cannibalize Search
campaigns by competing with phrase and broad match keywords. A user
found that 53% of his pMax budget went to the Search network, limiting
his Search campaigns. After removing Search Themes from pMax, spend
shifted to Shopping, and Search campaigns began performing again. 

 MKT1 GUIDE TO ANNUAL MARKETING PLANNING (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Marketing planning often falls short when treated as a check-the-box
task instead of a strategy to win the next year. Teams commonly make
mistakes like creating unprioritized idea lists and setting KPIs based
on top-down forecasts. Instead, the process should focus on a clear
roadmap of major priorities, similar to product teams. A successful
plan includes a vision, strategy, goals, forecasts, budget, and
timeline for key initiatives.

 TIKTOK SUBSCRIPTION EXPANSION: ENABLING MORE CREATORS TO ENHANCE
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 TikTok is expanding its subscription option to non-live creators.
This allows more users to build an audience of paying subscribers in
the app. Creators can customize their subscription packages to offer
three different tiers, selecting benefits such as private
communication channels and exclusive content. Eligible creators have
to be 18 years or older and have an account in good standing with 10K+
followers and 100K+ video views in the past calendar month. 

 AGGREGATION AND SEO: BEST PRACTICES (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Aggregation occurs when multiple sites rehash or break out a specific
angle from a trending article, often outranking the original
reporting. Newsrooms can protect their search market share by
aggregating their own content and linking back to the main source.
This strategy helps maintain visibility while optimizing for audience
search intent.
