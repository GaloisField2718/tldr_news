STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOU SHOULD POST YOUR BEST SOCIAL CONTENT AGAIN AND AGAIN (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Small brands have a 32% reach rate, while those with around 500K
followers have only a 12% reach rate. This is calculated by dividing
the number of views by total followers, meaning 68-88% of your
followers may not see a single one of your posts. Review your brand's
top 50 posts to find evergreen content and reuse those high performers
annually. 

 9 INFLUENCER MARKETING LESSONS FROM STORYLANE'S HEAD OF MARKETING (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Smaller creators often outperform larger ones because they're more
affordable and work harder than larger ones. Building a curated
influencer portfolio takes time, and 3 months is enough to evaluate
partnerships. Over-controlling a creator's content kills authenticity.
Work closely on the brief to give them all the context they need, but
let their voice shine through. Influencer onboarding and management is
a full-time job in itself. 

 EIGHT STEPS TO INCREASE REVENUE FROM YOUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Increasing customer retention by just 5% can boost profits by up to
95%, which shows the value of focusing on existing clients. Retention
strategies, like upselling, cross-selling, and enhancing customer
loyalty through exceptional service, are significantly more
cost-effective than acquiring new customers. Businesses can optimize
returning customer revenue growth by segmenting customers into
strategic profiles, enabling tailored marketing, operational
efficiency, and long-term profitability.

 HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR MARKETING BUDGET—AND MAKE SURE IT'S EFFICIENT
(13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Marketing budget planning for early- to growth-stage companies
involves aligning spend with efficiency metrics like CAC Ratio
(0.7-1.2), Payback Period (12-18 months), and LTV:CAC (3:1). Start by
calculating a ballpark figure based on revenue goals and these
metrics. Major budget categories include headcount, paid ads, events,
tools, and miscellaneous expenses, with headcount often being the
largest expenditure. Your budget process should include reconciling
with forecasts, setting monthly targets, and ensuring alignment with
top-of-funnel growth activities. Tracking throughout the year allows
adjustments based on pacing, hiring delays, or underperforming
campaigns.
