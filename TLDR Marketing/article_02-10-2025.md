 OPENAI'S NEW SOCIAL APP IS FILLED WITH TERRIFYING SAM ALTMAN
DEEPFAKES (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sora is already filled with deepfakes of Sam Altman in surreal
scenarios, from serving Pikachu drinks to stealing Nvidia GPUs. The
app's defining feature is a “cameo” system that lets users upload
biometric data to generate realistic deepfakes of themselves and
others. Despite parental controls and user permissions, Sora enables
mass creation of highly convincing synthetic content. 

 META TO USE AI CHATS TO PERSONALIZE CONTENT AND ADS FROM DECEMBER (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta will begin using interactions with its AI tools to personalize
content and ads on Facebook and Instagram starting December 16. The
change applies only to those who use Meta AI, and users cannot opt
out. Conversations through voice or text will be combined with
existing data, such as likes and follows, to shape recommendations,
though sensitive topics like religion, health, or political views will
not be used for ads. Meta AI currently has 1B monthly active users.
The rollout will exclude the UK, the European Union, and South Korea. 

 EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF AI ON THE LABOR MARKET (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This study found no evidence that AI has significantly disrupted the
US labor market since ChatGPT's release in 2022. While the
occupational mix has shifted slightly faster than in past periods,
these changes largely predate gen AI and mirror historical patterns.
Employment, unemployment, and industry-level shifts show no clear link
to AI exposure, automation, or augmentation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 KEEP VIDEO ADS UNDER 10 SECONDS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Video ads that are 10 seconds or shorter drive stronger results at a
lower cost than longer ads. In a study of 59,988 TV ad airings and
25,000+ Facebook ad impressions, ≤10 second ads generated 3x more
engagement on Facebook, up to 40% more website traffic on TV, and
similar sales compared to longer ads. Shorter ads would also save
$285,300 in airtime and generate 192,000 more site visits if aired 100
times on TV instead of 15 second ads. Effectiveness increases when
brands are mentioned early, with traffic rising 34.1% compared to
waiting until the end. 

 HOW TO SUCCEED IN A ZERO CLICK WORLD (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many brands still optimize for SEO or REO while AI assistants give
binary outcomes where a brand is either cited or invisible. For
example, a press release can be ignored by ChatGPT if it is not
structured correctly, even if it ranks well in Google. A better
approach is to create schema-rich FAQs, semantic headlines, and
backlinks to authority pages while earning mentions in media and
forums. This ensures AI systems recognize the brand and include it in
answers, not just rank it on a page. 

 HOW I TURNED FORGOTTEN IDEAS INTO CONSISTENT POSTS (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This guide outlines a 3-step content system. Step one is to post
ideas you care about, not ones you feel forced to make. Step two is to
build a habit of logging every idea immediately using tools like
Notes. Step three is to keep it simple and repeatable with a workflow
of create, edit, and post.

 GMAIL'S LATEST UPDATES: WHAT'S CHANGING, WHY IT MATTERS, AND HOW TO
ADAPT (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Gmail is giving subscribers more control and surfacing emails based
on engagement rather than send time. The new ‘Manage Subscriptions'
view lists each sender with a snapshot of how often they send
messages. The ‘Purchases' tab organizes receipts and delivery
messages into a scannable format that rewards transactional clarity.
In the ‘Promotions' tab, Gmail is using machine learning to push
relevant offers to the top while generic campaigns drop out of view.
These changes support a cleaner inbox and force email programs to
compete on usefulness and timing.

 THE MECHANICS OF NEUROBRANDING: BRAND STRATEGY THAT STARTS IN THE
FEELS (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article describes how to use neuroscience to build real brand
preference. The first mechanic is immersion. Identify where users
interact with the brand and make those moments emotionally rich. This
could be a scented store, tactile packaging, or a sensory-rich waiting
experience like Disney's Rise of the Resistance queue. The second
mechanism is neural coupling. Brands that tell stories that reflect
customer identity build loyalty without selling. The third mechanic is
subconscious priming. Repetition of a distinct color, sound, or phrase
wires emotional associations over time. 

 A CRASH COURSE ON LAGGING AND LEADING METRICS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Lagging metrics measure outcomes but are slow to respond. Leading
metrics give directional signals but need interpretation. Most teams
over-index on lagging metrics like NPS or revenue per user because
they feel more concrete and definitive. However, these often come too
late to guide action. Marketers can build better dashboards by pairing
each lagging metric with 2 to 3 leading ones. For example, tie
conversion rate to DAUs or time to first value. This dual tracking
helps steer strategy in real time and spot issues like churn or
underused features quickly.
