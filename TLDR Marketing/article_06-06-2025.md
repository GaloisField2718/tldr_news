 THE 2025 PINTEREST MIDYEAR TRENDS REPORT (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pinterest's midyear trends reveal a strong shift toward digital detox
and nature connection, especially among Gen Z. Users are seeking
rustic, farmhouse-inspired home décor with thrifted, natural
materials and earthy tones, reflecting a desire for cozy,
nature-driven spaces. Travel trends emphasize slow, mindful escapes
like nature bathing, book retreats, and mountain trips to disconnect
from technology. Beauty trends show rising interest in
astrology-inspired makeup and cool-toned palettes that allow personal
expression tied to zodiac signs. 

 INFLUENCERS ARE TURNING BRAND TRIPS INTO EXCLUSIVE REAL-LIFE FAN
EXPERIENCES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 95% of Gen Z and millennials want to turn online interests into
real-world connections. Influencers like Danielle Pheloung are
creating intimate fan experiences offline. In May, she hosted 25 women
at a Tribeca workout studio, gifting items from brands like Smart
Sweets, Lancôme, and Ouai. Influence today is about access rather
than follower count. Brands and platforms such as dcdx's Offline are
supporting creators by helping them host meaningful in-person events,
connecting brands with communities ranging from small gatherings to
larger meetups.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO WRITE SNACKABLE CONTENT: 5 TASTY TIPS FOR SOCIAL POSTS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 To write effective social media content, focus each post on one
small, rewarding idea that offers a tip, insight, or moment of
connection. Use a conversational tone with clear, punchy language,
mimicking a casual chat in a noisy café. Add personality with
metaphors, opinions, or mini-stories to stand out from bland content.
Start with short, curiosity-driven opening lines and use plenty of
white space to keep posts easy to read and engaging. 

 THE RISKS OF OFFERING “FREE” GOODS AND SERVICES (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Offering products or services for free can lead to undervaluation and
make it difficult to charge later. Even a small fee encourages
consumers to treat something with more care and recognize its value.
Companies can preserve long-term pricing power by clearly
communicating what their offering is worth through strategies like
bundling, strikethrough pricing, and time-limited trials. 

 INCREASE YOUR TIKTOK ENGAGEMENT RATE WITH THIS HACK (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Pingo AI, a language learning app launched in late 2024, gained
50,000 users and $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue within five
months through aggressive TikTok marketing. The founder scaled 12
social media accounts to nearly 10 million views, with the most viral
video (1.6 million views) featuring Korean language practice. The
highest engagement rates came from ambassador-run accounts, with one
faceless content account reaching 19.09%. The team boosted reach by
referencing non-competing apps to create more authentic content.

 GRINDR'S GUIDE TO MEANINGFUL 2SLGBTQ+ MARKETING (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Grindr's Pride strategy focuses on authentic year-round engagement by
centering queer voices, culture, and connection. Instead of rainbow
washing, they invest in meaningful experiences like the Grindr Rides
Tour and educational content like Daddy Lessons that bridge
generational gaps. They advise listening to queer voices, engaging
with culture before launching campaigns, and tailoring efforts to each
region. Real success means showing up beyond June, offering genuine
value, and building a lasting community. Brands that do this earn
loyalty and relevance. Grindr calls this ongoing commitment the Global
Gayborhood.

 DOES EMAIL LENGTH MATTER? WHAT 5M EMAILS TELLS US ABOUT ENGAGEMENT (5
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Emails under 300 words achieve the highest open and reply rates, with
reply rates more than doubling compared to longer pitches. Including
full press releases or excessive intro text reduces effectiveness, so
it's better to link to supporting material like datasets via Dropbox
or Google Drive. Pitches must be relevant to the journalist's specific
beat and personalized authentically without using insincere flattery.
Cutting fluff and getting to the story immediately helps keep the
email concise and impactful. Shorter emails are not lower quality,
they are simply more focused and easier for journalists to process
quickly. 

 THE HIDDEN COST OF PLAYING DEFENSE IN MARKETING (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Even with large budgets and strong brands, many mature SaaS companies
are losing ground by focusing on defending their position instead of
winning new customers. One example is a $10 billion firm with polished
messaging and regular updates that still fell behind faster startups.
Google also missed the moment with generative AI while Zoom outpaced
Skype by responding directly to what users needed. Defensive marketing
talks at customers instead of helping them, and in fast-moving
markets, that leads to decline over time.
