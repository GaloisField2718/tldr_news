 SUPPORT FOR A U.S. TIKTOK BAN CONTINUES TO DECLINE, AND HALF OF
ADULTS DOUBT IT WILL HAPPEN (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A Pew Research study shows that only 32% of Americans now support a
TikTok ban, down from 50% in March 2023. Republicans and
Republican-leaning independents are far more likely than Democrats and
Democratic leaners to support a ban (42% vs. 24%). Public opinion on
the U.S. TikTok sell-off bill continues to shift as more people
express confidence that the app will avoid a ban. Despite declining
support, political and legal efforts to force a sale of TikTok remain
active.
