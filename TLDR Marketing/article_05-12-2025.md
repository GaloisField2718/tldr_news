NEWS & TRENDS

 IF EVERYONE WANTS A VILLAGE, WHY ARE BRANDS STILL BUILDING ISLANDS?
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Convenience culture has reached its limit, leaving people feeling
disconnected. This is driving a renewed desire for community and
belonging. Small behavior shifts show people choosing human
interactions over automated services, and cultural conversations
online reflect fatigue with self-sufficiency. Some brands are
responding with community-minded ideas like shared rides or lending
libraries that bring neighbors together. 2026 will favor brands that
help people feel part of something rather than offering another
frictionless service, because people now value connection more than
efficiency. 

 FAKE AI-GENERATED SHOPS, ADS FLOURISH ON FACEBOOK (2 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Scammers are exploiting Facebook's ad network using AI to create fake
online shops that appear credible. These ads promote trending items
with authentic-looking visuals and attractive prices. When clicked,
users are sent to fraudulent e-commerce sites and tricked into making
purchases. Victims often receive knockoffs or no product at all. One
case involved fake ads for UK-based brands C'est La Vie and Mabel &
Daisy, which were actually connected to Chinese warehouses. Meta
responded by removing the ads, but it continues to profit from scam
content. One estimate places annual scam ad revenue at $7 billion.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AN OUTBOUND PLAYBOOK FOR 2025 (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Workflows.io reached $2M ARR by combining cold and signal-based
outbound with AI-enhanced qualification. Starting from a wide TAM, the
team used Clay, ChatGPT, BuiltWith, Crunchbase, and other tools to
enrich and score prospects. Campaigns were segmented by signal
strength and account tier. Top-performing plays were driven by founder
LinkedIn engagement and customer alumni tracking. Sequences included
email and LinkedIn variations tested for performance. Signal-based
outreach delivered 2x to 10x higher results, with a standout 25.4%
reply rate from messaging warm founder connections. 

 PROMPT FOR TURNING YOUTUBE VIDEOS INTO NEWSLETTERS (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This AI prompt streamlines turning YouTube videos into multiple
newsletter ideas. The prompt feeds a video transcript to Claude, which
identifies potential topics for short- and long-form emails, evaluates
which topics align best with the offer being promoted, and provides a
ranked list of relevance. The output includes main themes, recommended
email format for each topic, and a congruence score with the offer,
making it faster and easier to generate 4-5 actionable newsletter
ideas from a single video. 

 DO SELF-PROMOTIONAL “BEST” LISTS BOOST CHATGPT VISIBILITY? (10
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The majority of citations ChatGPT uses for product, software, and
agency recommendations come from listicle content, with blog-based
“best” lists leading across categories. A study found that brands
that rank themselves highly in such lists were more likely to be
recommended. In the software category, general landing pages were
cited more than blog posts, while in product queries, actual product
pages dominated. First-party links more often pointed to internal
landing pages than to homepages or listicles. Citations from
low-authority and non-editorial websites remain frequent, particularly
outside of Google's ecosystem.

 STREAMLINE YOUR SEARCH CONSOLE ANALYSIS WITH THE NEW AI-POWERED
CONFIGURATION (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 New AI-powered features in Google Search Console are designed to
reduce the time it takes to set up analysis in the Performance report.
The tool turns natural language requests into filters, comparisons,
and metric selections. It can narrow data by query, page, country,
device, search appearance, or date range, and it can also set up
complex comparisons and select metrics like Clicks or Average CTR. The
rollout is limited, and the feature only supports the Performance
report for Search results. 

 SAVEE (TOOL) [12] 

 Savee is a platform for collecting and discovering design
inspiration. Its mobile app lets users save ideas, organize them in
customizable grids, and search by image or color to find visually
similar content. It also supports team collaboration and integrates
with Figma and major browsers, serving as a hub for both inspiration
and design work.

 HOW TO DO ANNUAL PLANNING FOR SEO (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Annual SEO planning enables execution of high-impact initiatives,
even in a volatile traffic environment. This piece describes a process
beginning with a candid SWOT to assess internal strengths and external
opportunities. Traffic goals are set using data from Google Search
Console, separating branded queries and identifying meaningful
baselines. These traffic targets are then tied directly to revenue,
supported by TAM analysis. Each tactic is evaluated for lift and
feasibility before being scheduled with clear milestones and
dependencies. A strong plan also includes internal alignment,
cross-functional support, and a defined structure for requesting
resources or visibility. 

 2025 WAS THE YEAR OF EVERYTHING (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Marketers faced intense pressure this year. Tight budgets, AI
overload, and economic uncertainty are pushing CMOs to focus on
end-to-end growth rather than just campaigns. The widespread use of
the same AI tools is producing similar outputs that fail to engage
consumers. Standing out requires speed, creativity, and real human
insight. Brands must read culture in real time, act on moments that
matter, and build micro-communities, leverage influencers, and create
immersive experiences. Differentiation is no longer optional, it is
essential.
