 STREAMING'S LOYALTY BATTLE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Streaming trends reveal a shift from linear TV to digital, with
streaming now making up 41% of US TV time. Netflix stands out as the
dominant platform, while others face challenges like churn and
retention. "Serial pausers," who resubscribe within 6 months,
complicate loyalty efforts. Disney and Comcast showed streaming
profitability, with boosts from live sports and blockbuster content,
while Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount made gains but struggled
with legacy TV and box office downturns.

FIRST TO GO (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A study found that after ChatGPT's launch, demand for freelance jobs
in automation-prone fields dropped 21%, with writing, software
development, and engineering jobs most affected. Graphic design and 3D
modeling gigs fell by 17% due to AI image generation tools.

 HOW CONTENT PRUNING BOOSTED TRAFFIC BY 16% (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To reduce content clutter and improve site health, focus on posts
with low traffic, no conversions, or outdated information. Remove
content that targets zero-search keywords, has no backlinks, or shows
minimal engagement. Eliminate duplication or redundancy, especially if
similar topics are now merged in search intent. Remove
programmatically produced posts with low search value and translations
in languages with no relevant search volume.

ineffective paid ads due to unclear messaging and execution. Kwan's

 THE ULTIMATE PLAYBOOK FOR MARKETING DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS (12 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 B2B strategies should focus on organic (40%) and direct (30%)
channels to build trust, while paid and social channels support. B2C
businesses prioritize speed, using paid and social channels (30% each)
supplemented by organic and direct. Diversify channels to avoid
over-reliance, build owned assets like email lists, and monitor
metrics for optimization. Test strategies, set realistic timelines,
and limit dependency on paid ads to manage growth and costs
effectively.

 THE CREATOR 'ONE OFF' PROBLEM (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Long-term creator-brand deals are gaining traction, with creators
like Airrack advocating for year-long partnerships. Smaller brands
often stick to one-off deals as budget constraints limit flexibility,
but larger brands are gradually moving toward collaboration-driven
strategies. Industry leaders suggest that integrating creator deals
into media budgets, rather than PR or social video spend, could
streamline the process and foster growth in the long run. 

 THE #1 THING TO DO IN A NEW MARKETING JOB (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Create a #marketing-ideas channel on Slack or Teams to make an
immediate impact in a new marketing job. Invite colleagues from all
departments. The channel should encourage all suggestions, with no
“bad” ideas, and be actively maintained by sharing examples
weekly. This approach helped one marketer at Wiz launch a successful
"Cloud Security Job Board" by adapting a competitor's concept. 

 BLUESKY ISN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR YOUR BRAND. NO NEW SOCIAL NETWORK IS (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Emerging social networks like Bluesky and Mastodon have small user
bases, making them inefficient for brand investment. New platforms
require time to learn and adapt, limiting content performance. Focus
on optimizing established networks with larger audiences instead of
chasing new ones. Secure your brand name on new platforms but wait for
them to mature before committing resources. Trend reports should
account for Millennials, a large and active online audience, instead
of over-focusing on Gen Z.
