NEWS & TRENDS

 TIKTOK LAUNCHES NEW IN-STREAM SHOPPING PUSH (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TikTok reports that millions of items have been purchased from nearly
half a million merchants and brands over the past year through its
in-app shopping feature. As part of its push to boost in-stream
shopping, TikTok has launched the “Fall Deals For You” campaign,
offering discounts from brands like Dyson and e.l.f. Cosmetics.
However, despite efforts to replicate the success in China, Western
users remain cautious about shopping directly within social apps. 

 THE SUBSCRIPTION ECONOMY HAS REACHED A WATERSHED MOMENT (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Subscribers are frustrated by rising prices, lack of flexibility, and
"vampire subscriptions" they can't track. While password-sharing
crackdowns have led to new subscriptions, many users are opting to
cancel or seek alternatives. The popularity of tiered subscriptions,
particularly those with ad-supported plans, is growing, but they risk
diminishing user experience through excessive advertising. In Europe,
indirect subscriptions through telcos are thriving, and Super Bundling
platforms that consolidate multiple services are anticipated to lead
the market by simplifying billing and enhancing customer satisfaction.

 6 TAKEAWAYS FROM STORYLANE'S DEMO DUNDIES (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Storylane's Demo Dundies event successfully reactivated cold
enterprise deals by focusing on customer advocacy. By aligning the
event with pop culture, specifically referencing The Office, it tapped
into an engaged fan base. It maximized reach with shareable content,
involving over 100 nominees and panelists to promote the event, and
incentivized participation with a $5,000 trip to Paris. The team
carefully scripted and rehearsed the event, using costumes and humor
to enhance engagement. The event's recording was repurposed for sales
enablement, helping close deals with cold prospects.

MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Customer advocacy is built by turning loyal customers into promoters
of your brand. Social listening helps brands identify these advocates,
track online conversations, and respond to feedback in real time. This
approach enhances customer relationships and drives brand awareness.
Examples of this strategy include brands like Grubhub, which used
social listening during the pandemic to address concerns, and Spotify,
which created dedicated social accounts for support.

 PAINKILLERS VS VITAMINS IN B2B MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Selling "painkillers" is easier than "vitamins" because they address
urgent needs, leading to faster purchasing decisions. In B2B
marketing, painkillers solve immediate problems that prospects can't
ignore, reducing objections like “call us back next year.” This
approach contrasts with vitamins, which offer long-term benefits but
don't create the same urgency.
