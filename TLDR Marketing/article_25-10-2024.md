companies to move away from the model. MLM's reputation has been
damaged by regulatory attention, concerns about the legality of its
practices, and low earnings for most participants. Companies like Avon
and Amway defend the model, but others are shifting toward affiliate
models or direct sales. Critics argue that the MLM model is outdated
and unsustainable in the current market. Some firms are exploring
alternative sales channels such as e-commerce, which introduce new
pricing challenges.

 HOW TO DO MULTI-CHANNEL MARKETING (HINT: IT'S NOT JUST TWO PLATFORMS)
(4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Brands need to adopt a truly multi-channel strategy, expanding beyond
just TikTok and Instagram to reach diverse audience segments.
Long-form content is gaining traction, particularly on platforms like

Pinterest present opportunities for brands to connect with younger
audiences through community-building and influencer marketing.
