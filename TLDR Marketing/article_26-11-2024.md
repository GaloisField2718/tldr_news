NEWS & TRENDS

 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM PODSCRIBE'S PODCAST & STREAMING PERFORMANCE REPORT
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 High-quality podcast ads, particularly those with personal
endorsements and clear listener benefits, drive better performance
compared to lower-quality ones. Mid-roll ads placed earlier in
episodes yield the best visitor rates, outperforming pre- and
post-roll spots. Ads longer than 60 seconds show higher conversion
rates, and episodic buys, where ads run in a single episode for at
least 30 days, perform better than impression-based campaigns. Ad
stacking reduces effectiveness. Health, fitness, and education
podcasts achieve the highest visitor rates, while fashion and retail
excel in cost-per-acquisition efficiency. 

 2024 KANTAR MEDIA TRENDS & PREDICTIONS REPORT (29 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The media and advertising industry is at an inflection point. With AI
transforming content creation, publishers must leverage data-driven
strategies and incorporate interactive advertising to avoid spending
resources inefficiently due to poor targeting or ad optimization.

 B2B NEWSLETTER MARKETING: HOW IT DIFFERS FROM EMAIL PROMOTIONS & WHAT
BRANDS CAN LEARN FROM INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Unlike promotional emails, which focus on urgent calls to action, B2B
newsletters should prioritize delivering value over time. Consistency
is key, as newsletters build long-term ROI. Hire writers with
journalistic backgrounds to prioritize audience needs over
self-serving content. Content based on personal opinions and original
data also drive higher engagement.

 HERE'S WHERE EACH OF THE BIG SOCIAL PLATFORM STANDS ON EXTERNAL LINKS
(4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Social platforms aren't overly keen on driving traffic to your
brand's site. Facebook's algorithm doesn't explicitly penalize links,
but link posts have declined in visibility and engagement. Instagram
restricts links to Stories, limiting broader reach. X explicitly
limits link reach, while TikTok and Snapchat minimally support
external links, with exceptions for competitors. LinkedIn reduces link
preview visibility unless promoted. Bluesky remains an exception,
valuing links as integral to its platform. 

 AI HAS BEEN A BOON FOR MARKETING, BUT THE DARK SIDE OF USING
ALGORITHMS TO SELL PRODUCTS AND BRANDS IS LITTLE STUDIED (1 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 AI's ethical risks are often overlooked. A review of 290 marketing
studies found only 33 addressed AI's negative impacts, which include
perpetuating stereotypes, spreading misinformation, and harming mental
health through tools like beauty filters. These risks particularly
affect vulnerable groups, such as young women. There is a need to
study AI's ethical challenges to ensure its responsible use benefits
all, not just large companies.
