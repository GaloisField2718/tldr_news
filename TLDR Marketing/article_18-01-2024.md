 GOOGLE INTRODUCES ‚ÄòCIRCLE TO SEARCH,‚Äô A NEW WAY TO SEARCH FROM
ANYWHERE ON ANDROID USING GESTURES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google has introduced "Circle to Search," a new Android search
feature that allows users to initiate searches through gestures like
circling, tapping, or highlighting any content. Users will no longer
have to stop what they‚Äôre doing to start a search or take a
screenshot as a reminder to search for something later. The search
results users see will differ based on their query and the Google Labs
products they opt into. Circle to Search will launch on January 31. 

 B2B MARKETING BENCHMARK: SPOTLIGHT ON THE TECH INDUSTRY (5 MINUTE
READ) [6]

marketers in 4 global regions across financial services,
agency/advertising, healthcare, education, and tech industries.

their budgets toward brand building. 70% of B2B CMOs at tech companies
said they‚Äôre unable to prove the impact of brand campaigns. They
tend to rely on thought leadership content to reach prospects.

 BEST TIMES TO POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN 2024 (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There isn‚Äôt a golden publishing hour that‚Äôs the ideal time to
post for every social media account. However, it does matter when you
post, because most algorithms consider recency a ranking factor. This
guide reviews several high-profile studies to share when the overall
‚Äúbest times‚Äù to post on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and
LinkedIn are. Use the times as a starting point for your own social
media schedule, and then adjust based on when your audience is online,
the type of content you publish, and how people consume your content. 

 PSYCHOLOGICAL PRICING TACTICS TO FIGHT THE INFLATION BLUES (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Amid lingering inflation concerns, companies must employ
psychological pricing strategies to encourage consumer spending. This
article covers tactics including tiered pricing, buy one get one free
offers, discounts on base prices, transparency about price increases,
charm pricing (ending in 99), and the shift towards subscription
models. If used properly, pricing strategies can influence consumer
perceptions and enhance the perceived value of purchases even in
inflationary periods. 

 FRAMING: WHY WE‚ÄôRE INFLUENCED BY THE WAY INFORMATION IS PRESENTED
(4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Snickers changing their slogan to ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not you when you‚Äôre
hungry‚Äù resulted in a 16% increase in sales. Research shows that the
way something is framed influences people‚Äôs choices. In particular,
making an offer more positive (e.g. ‚Äú75% lean‚Äù instead of ‚Äú25%
fat‚Äù) tends to improve results. Brands should frame their product as
the obvious choice among competitors and always sell the benefits
rather than the contents.

 THIS IS HOW THE TOP SAAS RETAIN USERS (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This guide unveils the strategies employed by high-retention SaaS
companies, focusing on the pivotal role of effective communication,
particularly through email. It underscores the importance of
personalized onboarding to lead users to the "aha moment," the use of
email newsletters for habit-building, and the impact of
behavior-triggered emails on user engagement. With the abundance of
data, companies should strive to create hyper-personalized experiences
and reduce churn rates. 

 DRIVING ORGANIC TRAFFIC FROM GOOGLE DISCOVER WITH COMPELLING WEB
STORIES (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 An e-commerce store was able to drive 2.2 million clicks from Google
Discover by using Web Stories. The team noticed that lifestyle and
news publishers were able to generate large amounts of traffic with
Web Stories, which are similar to Instagram Stories. They decided to
experiment with it, using BuzzSumo, open-source images, and a free
WordPress Plugin. This resulted in millions of new visits, primarily
from Google Discover.

 STANLEY HYPE AND SAMBA CRINGE: WHY PRODUCTS FALL IN AND OUT OF STYLE
(6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Adidas Samba shoe achieved viral popularity within the last few
years but is now out of style. Stanley cups might be headed towards
the same result. That can be partly explained by Ren√© Girard‚Äôs
theory of Mimetic Desire, which suggests that we don‚Äôt want what we
want, we desire what others want (especially people of status). This
post walks through how Adidas and Stanley achieved virality, as well
as lessons that brands can learn from when considering influencer
marketing. 

 TO BUNDLE OR NOT TO BUNDLE (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In the digital landscape, bundling can serve as a strategic tool for
firms to beat the competition. By bundling their offerings, companies
can discourage direct price competition and create differentiation.
Additionally, the strategy can be used to move laterally into other
market segments, similar to what Amazon did with Prime Video.
