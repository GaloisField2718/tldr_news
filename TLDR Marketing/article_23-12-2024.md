 WAS YOUR FAVORITE HOLIDAY TRADITION ONCE A MARKETING CAMPAIGN? (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Many holiday traditions, like Santa Claus and candy canes, originated
from marketing campaigns in the 19th and 20th centuries. Coca-Cola's
1930s Santa ads standardized the modern image of Santa, while Hallmark
popularized mass-produced Christmas cards in the early 20th century.
Candy canes and Hershey's Kisses became holiday staples through clever
advertising, and Starbucks' red holiday cup, introduced in 1997, now
signals the start of the season. These campaigns shaped cultural
celebrations, embedding brands into holiday rituals.
