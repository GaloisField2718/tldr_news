 AN INFLECTION POINT FOR THE CREATOR ECONOMY (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Ad revenue from user-generated content is projected to surpass that
of traditional media for the first time, marking a major turning point
in how audiences consume and advertisers value content. Revenue from
creator-generated content is expected to grow by 20% this year and
more than double by 2030, reaching $376.6 billion as creators attract
larger brand deals, ad partnerships, and sponsorships. As creators
invest more in production quality and scale their operations, the
distinction between independent creators and traditional media
companies will continue to blur, making the term creator economy feel
outdated as it evolves into a unified media ecosystem 

 MARKETERS USING AI PUBLISH 42% MORE CONTENT [THE STATE OF AI IN
CONTENT MARKETING] (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A new report from Ahrefs found that 87% of marketers use AI for
content creation, allowing them to publish 42% more content monthly
compared to those who do not use AI. ChatGPT is the most used AI tool
at 44%, followed by Gemini and Claude. Blog posts are the most common
AI-generated content type (87%), and top tasks include brainstorming
(76%), outlining (73%), and updating (67%). Despite the prevalence of
AI, only 4% publish unedited AI content, and 97% edit or review
outputs, with 80% doing so manually. Just 16% of companies disclose
their use of AI in content. 

 6 KEY FINDINGS FROM BOND'S AI TRENDS REPORT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ChatGPT's adoption outpaced Google and Facebook in their early years.
While usage costs are falling, training costs continue to rise. OpenAI
and Google are monetizing through subscriptions, APIs, ads, and
embedded AI tools. Horizontal platforms are enabling broad
integration, while industry-specific vendors offer tailored solutions.
Closed-source models lead for their usability and familiarity, but
open-source alternatives are gaining ground among developers seeking
flexibility and lower costs. Chinese AI models are narrowing the gap
with US counterparts, supported by local demand, lower training
expenses, and a more positive public view of AI.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 10 BRANDS KILLING IT ON LINKEDIN RIGHT NOW & WHY (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LinkedIn has shifted from a professional network to a content-first
platform where brands showcase thought leadership and engage audiences
with substance. Companies like Figma, Sephora, and Duolingo have built
strong followings by creating content that reflects their company
culture, shares relevant industry perspectives, and responds quickly
to current events. Their success comes from consistently publishing a
mix of content formats such as short posts, videos, and commentary
while maintaining a recognizable tone that builds familiarity and
trust over time. 

 CHUNKS, PASSAGES, AND MICRO-ANSWER ENGINE OPTIMIZATION WINS IN GOOGLE
AI MODE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google now synthesizes answers by combining content chunks that
respond to multiple related queries, rather than just the one typed by
the user. A piece of content does not need to win the original query
to be featured in AI Mode as long as it addresses one of the
supporting angles like pricing, integrations, or user needs. Marketers
must think in terms of micro-answer engine optimization where small,
targeted passages can secure visibility across a range of cascading
queries.

 THE GENTLE SINGULARITY (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This essay from Sam Altman reflects on how AI has already passed the
point of no return. By 2026, AI may generate new discoveries or ideas
that humans have not yet uncovered. By 2027, humanoid robots could
perform real-world tasks. By 2030, people may achieve far more than
they could a decade earlier. The 2030s could bring abundant
intelligence and energy, enabling breakthroughs in space and
brain-computer interfaces. Challenges like safety, alignment, and fair
access remain. However, Altman believes society can adapt by sharing
AI widely and focusing on collective goals. 

 CUSTOMER-OBSESSED INNOVATION (23 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Lyft increased annual revenue by 31% and reached profitability for
the first time by centering its turnaround strategy on deep customer
understanding. Leadership prioritized firsthand experiences, including
the CEO regularly driving and holding roundtables with drivers across
cities like New York and San Francisco. This led to features like
Price Lock to ease rider frustration with surge pricing, Women Plus
Connect to improve safety and comfort for female users, and Restroom
Finder to address driver dignity, all reinforcing Lyft's mission to
serve both sides of its marketplace.
