 FTC ISSUES SWEEPING DEMANDS TO MEDIA RATING FIRMS OVER INDUSTRY TIES
(3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The FTC has issued investigative demands to media rating firms like
NewsGuard, Ad Fontes Media, and DoubleVerify, requesting operational,
financial, and communications data. The inquiry is focused on how
these companies evaluate misinformation, hate speech, and deceptive
content, and how their methodologies and partnerships may impact the
flow of advertising dollars. By demanding detailed records dating back
to 2019, the FTC is signaling heightened scrutiny over the role these
firms play in shaping media visibility and influencing which outlets
brands consider safe for ad placements.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO FIND YOUR BRAND'S NICHE ON SOCIAL MEDIA (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 93% of consumers say brands should stay informed about online
culture, much of which lives in niche communities. Finding the right
niche starts with tracking where relevant conversations are happening,
such as hashtags, subreddits, or creator networks that align with your
audience. Marketers can identify which formats, references, and tones
resonate, then engage through creators or content that reflect the
community's values. As the brand earns trust, ongoing feedback helps
refine the message and stay aligned with the niche as it evolves. 

 14 AHA MOMENT EXAMPLES FROM STARTUPS TO SPARK YOUR INSPIRATION (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The ‘aha' moment is a sudden shift in perception where users
understand a product's value without needing further explanation. It
typically follows a period of confusion and feels rewarding, which
reinforces product use and loyalty. Examples from companies that got
it right include when Calendly users realize scheduling can happen
without email back-and-forth, when Notion users connect their second
note and see how everything links, or when Spotify users discover the
Daily Mix and understand its personalized value.

likelihood by 21%. The effect is weaker if quality is poor or if
