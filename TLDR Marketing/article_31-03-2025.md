 THE CREATOR ECONOMY: MAKING DOLLARS AND SENSE OUT OF SOCIAL
PARTNERSHIPS (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Driven by increased digital content consumption and the mainstreaming
of online culture, the creator economy is currently valued at $250
billion and is projected to hit $500 billion by 2027. Influencer
marketing has proven highly effective, with 92% of marketers reporting
that creator-led content outperforms organic brand content. Platforms
like Instagram and TikTok dominate creator partnerships, while
LinkedIn and Snapchat offer growing opportunities for niche audiences.
AI is streamlining influencer discovery and content creation, making
it easier for brands to manage partnerships and improve content
quality. Moving forward, brands are shifting toward co-creating
products with creators, expanding beyond social media content to build
deeper, long-term consumer trust.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 7 WINNING A/B TESTS THAT FEEL ILLEGAL TO KNOW (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A 4-year study of 150,000 A/B tests showed that most optimizations
fail, with clarity consistently outperforming conventional best
practices. Companies like Brex improved conversion by removing
trust-building elements like customer logos, which unintentionally
caused doubt or distraction. Direct copy, single-message layouts, and
simpler user journeys were more effective than emotional appeals or
social proof. The study found that eliminating or reducing carousels
and using neutral phrasing on CTAs drove better results. 

 3 CAMPAIGN PLAYS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Creative marketing can be effective without large budgets. Examples
of this include wrapping a nearby train station instead of renting an
expensive conference booth, using real social proof on websites, and
renting a Times Square billboard for a short period to capture social
media content. The focus is on being quick, creative, and executing in
ways that capture attention while keeping costs low.

 HOW TO DIVIDE SALES AND MARKETING BUDGET IN B2B: BENCHMARKS AND
INSIGHTS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sales often gets more budget because it is directly tied to revenue,
but overspending on sales without enough marketing support can hurt
pipeline growth. The general rule is to allocate 30% of the combined
sales and marketing budget to marketing, though this varies based on
company size, contract value, and growth rates. Smaller companies and
fast-growing companies often spend more on marketing, while companies
with higher contract values allocate more to sales. It's important to
use the 30% rule as a starting point but adjust the ratio based on
company-specific factors.

 INSIDE FIGMA'S PRICING EVOLUTION (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Figma's pricing evolved to balance simplicity and growth while
staying true to its vision of making design accessible. Initially, it
charged only Editors and kept Viewers free to encourage adoption,
later introducing FigJam and Dev Mode with separate pricing. By 2025,
it streamlined its model into 3 paid seat types: Collab, Dev, and
Full, bundling access to all products and aligning pricing with user
needs. This update raised Full Seat prices by 20%-35% and reduced
complexity, making it easier for customers to choose the right plan. 

 THE GEN X CAREER MELTDOWN (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Gen X marketers and creatives are facing a career meltdown as
industries shrink, devalue expertise, and replace them with younger
talent, AI, and social media creators. Once essential in journalism,
design, and advertising, many now struggle to stay relevant as
marketing shifts toward automation and influencer-driven trends. Job
cuts, outsourcing, and declining pay are forcing them to rethink their
careers in middle age. 

 BEYOND BLUESKY: THESE ARE THE APPS BUILDING SOCIAL EXPERIENCES ON THE

Instagram clone), SkyFeed (a no-code feed builder), and Smoke Signal

user-driven platforms. The movement prioritizes open standards,
discoverability, and creator control over content and data.
