NEWS & TRENDS

 5 PREDICTIONS FOR THE 2024 HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON (4 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Mobile will account for over half of holiday e-commerce sales due to
Gen Z's shopping growth, mobile-native apps, and rising buy-now
pay-later (BNPL) options. Overall holiday e-commerce is expected to
grow only 5% this year. With a shorter Christmas shopping season of 29
days, email volume will increase to counter higher digital ad costs.
Social commerce will experience growth from new platforms and
increased Gen Z usage. BNPL is projected to grow 9% YoY, driven by
retailers promoting in-store offers.

to other platforms, with 87% indulging in gifts for themselves during
the season. They also make 80% more travel-related purchases. The
platform's diverse community celebrates various cultural traditions,
contributing to a 1.24X higher spend across categories.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE "CHIEF ___ OFFICER" TRICK FOR INFLUENCERS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Instead of just paying an influencer to endorse your product, assign
them a 'Chief' title that suggests they co-created it. Announce this
title on your brand's social media and create a dedicated landing page
on your website for the influencer to direct their followers. While
the influencer doesn't receive ownership or a real role, the title
enhances the campaign's impact through the Parasocial Interaction
Effect and the Halo Effect. 

 5 LOW EFFORT SAAS CONVERSION STRATEGIES (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To enhance SaaS conversions, create concise landing pages with less
than 200 words. Use exploratory headlines instead of commitment-heavy
phrases to make users feel more inclined to interact. Consider
removing the word "free" from CTAs, as it can sometimes diminish
perceived value and trigger skepticism. Implement time-limited
discounts to generate urgency and drive immediate action from your
audience. Shift from traditional "Call to Action" buttons to "Call to
Value" messages that highlight the benefits users will receive.

 THE CONTINUOUS SEO BATTLE (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The rise of AI Overviews and rich snippets in search results is
reducing CTRs to traditional websites. Search engines are increasingly
delivering concise, relevant information directly in SERPs, often
synthesizing content from multiple sources. This shift favors content
that is easily understood by both AI algorithms and human users,
changing the dynamics of visibility and engagement in search results. 

 MARKETERS ON FIRE: HINGE CMO TALKS ‚ÄòNO ORDINARY LOVE' CAMPAIGN AND
GEN Z MARKETING (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Hinge's ‚ÄúNo Ordinary Love‚Äù campaign features an 80-page zine of
modern romance stories by contemporary authors, showcasing couples who
met on the app. The printed zine reflects the resurgence of romance
literature and trends on BookTok. Hinge aims to encourage in-person
interactions rather than app engagement, setting itself apart from
competitors.
