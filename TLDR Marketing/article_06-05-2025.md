NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE ANNOUNCES CTV AD UPDATES, INCLUDING IMPROVED AI ASSISTANCE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google is expanding its CTV advertising reach through new
partnerships with major streaming platforms, including Netflix,
NBCUniversal, and Disney, while also integrating with Tubi, Spotify,
and Roblox. These updates create more inventory during live events and
tentpole moments, allowing for high-impact, TV-like brand experiences
with greater contextual alignment. 

 ADOLESCENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS USE SOCIAL MEDIA
DIFFERENTLY THAN THEIR PEERS, STUDY SUGGESTS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adolescents with mental health conditions spend about 50 minutes more
per day on social media and report greater dissatisfaction with online
friendships than their peers. Among those with internalizing
conditions like anxiety or depression, 48% compare themselves to
others online. This is twice the rate of those without such
conditions. They also report more mood changes in response to likes
and comments and lower self-control over time spent online.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO WIN IN THE MODERN-DAY SEARCH ERA (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Modern search campaigns rely on simplification and automation.
They're built on 4 pillars: consolidation, Broad Match, Smart Bidding,
and strong creatives. Consolidating campaigns improves Smart Bidding
by providing more data. In one case study, merging 19 campaigns into 4
led to a 253% increase in conversions and a 60% drop in CPA. Broad
Match now performs well when paired with Smart Bidding, but it
requires precise targets to prevent wasted spend. 

 WHICH DISCOUNT DRIVES MORE SALES, 16.5% OFF OR 17% OFF? (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Precise percentage discounts like 16.5% often outperform round
numbers like 17% in driving conversions, even when the actual value is
lower. Shoppers perceive decimal discounts as more calculated and
temporary, which increases urgency and purchase intent. This tactic
works best when not paired with urgency copy and is more effective for
functional products than luxury items.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 GET YOUR PRODUCTS ON CHATGPT SHOPPING (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ChatGPT now shows product recommendations in search results based on
prompts with shopping intent, displaying images, prices, ratings, and
explanations. It currently does not include ads, which means that
e-commerce businesses can gain visibility for free. To improve the
chance of being recommended, enable OpenAI's crawler, use detailed
Schema.org product markup, and maintain strong external reviews from
sources like Amazon and Wired. OpenAI may also consider users' prompt
history and preferences when making recommendations. 

 PINTEREST'S NEW VISUAL SEARCH FEATURES FOR A MORE PERSONALIZED
DISCOVERY EXPERIENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Pinterest is launching new visual search tools that help users
explore fashion ideas without needing to use specific keywords. They
decode images into searchable terms, enable object-level refinements,
and allow users to filter by style, color, or occasion. This new
feature makes Pinterest a more dynamic and shoppable search platform.

 BRAND MANAGEMENT MISTAKES HOLD BACK PELOTON (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Peloton's core issue is not its product offering but the failure to
clearly communicate its brand promise. Instead of highlighting its
unique community-driven and empowering fitness experience, it has
relied on price-led campaigns, category-level messaging, and shifting
audience targets. Without a compelling articulation of its “why,”
Peloton remains undifferentiated in a crowded market. 

 AI IS NOT A STRATEGY & OTHER TAKEAWAYS FROM THE AI MARKETING SUMMIT
IN NYC (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Marketers now view AI as essential but are struggling to balance
automation with quality, ethics, and brand strategy. Companies like
Bayer use AI to generate up to 500 pieces of content daily, while
Mastercard created tools that deliver real-time insights and
trend-based media buying. Many warn that overuse of AI leads to
repetitive, low-quality content that consumers easily recognize and
reject.
