 COSTCO IS BUILDING OUT AN AD BUSINESS USING ITS SHOPPERS' DATA (6
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Costco is building out an ad network built on its trove of loyalty
membership data, using its 74.5 million household members' shopping
habits and past purchases to power targeted advertising on and off its
website. The wholesale retailer is still testing such capabilities,
and it's fielding offers from potential ad-tech vendors, but the move
signals that the third-largest retailer in the US could become a
formidable player in the already deeply fragmented retail media space,
which is estimated to reach $166 billion by 2025, and responsible for
20% of all digital media spend this year.

WEEK BECAUSE ARTISTS ARE FED UP WITH META'S AI POLICIES (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Cara, an anti-AI social app for artists, surged from 40,000 to
650,000 users in a week as artists fled Meta's exploitative AI
policies, seeking a safer space to share their work. Founder Jingna
Zhang, a renowned photographer and advocate for artists' rights, has
positioned Cara as a haven for creatives to display their portfolios
without fear of AI misuse.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 USE LINKEDIN'S THOUGHT-LEADER ADS TO BOOST ORGANIC POSTS AND REDUCE
COST PER RESULT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 You will get more impressions and results for your money if a
LinkedIn ad has a lot of engagement in the form of likes and comments.
First, make an organic post that addresses the problem that your
business is supposed to solve and also offers a narrative that gets
engagement. It may take multiple tries to find the post that captures
people's imagination and inspires the kind of comments and engagements
you're looking for. The following day, edit the post to add in a
call-to-action and a couple of lines about your service or product.
Finally, boost the post with Thought-Leader Ads. This can help you
achieve more affordable ad impressions, as well as a higher conversion
rate due to the social proof. 

 SUNSET FLOWS: A CRUCIAL KEY TO BETTER EMAIL DELIVERABILITY (9 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A sunset flow begins with a series of emails you send to subscribers
who aren't engaging with your marketing messages. Once you've
identified the people who still aren't engaging at the end of the
flow, you reduce or suppress sending to them altogether. A good sunset
flow sets you up to ensure that your audience is both interested and
engaged. This guide covers 2 types of sunset flows for never-openers
and for subscribers who previously engaged. It also shares tips and
tricks to focus on in the flows and what to do with folks who do not
engage at all after a sunset flow. 

 HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR VOLUNTARY CHURN (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Reducing churn should be the top priority for every team at
scaling-stage companies ‚Äì particularly for subscription businesses.
Involuntary churn is when a customer's renewal payment fails, while
voluntary churn is when a customer leaves on purpose by canceling.
Important voluntary churn metrics include volume of ‚Äúauto-renew
OFF‚Äù users, volume of ‚Äúauto-renew back ON‚Äù users, timing of
cancellation, cancellation reasons, and take rate of discount/pause
offers. To address voluntary churn, use a single-choice survey to
determine the reasons, pay attention to how quickly it happens, offer
a one-click option to turn auto-renew back on, use discounts in the
cancellation flow, offer a pause option, and show what will be lost by
downgrading.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 INSTAGRAM CLARIFIES ADVICE ON SINGLE WORD CTAS AND LONGER REELS (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An Instagram video suggested that posts asking for specific
engagement, like single-word comments, might be restricted due to
anti-spam measures. After deleting and reposting the video, Instagram
clarified that general engagement tactics are acceptable, but content
explicitly designed to hack reach by soliciting specific interactions
could be penalized. Using 3rd-party services like ManyChat for
engagement is also acceptable. Reels longer than 90 secs won't be
recommended to non-followers. However, creators can still post longer
Reels to engage their existing audience. 

 NOTEBOOKLM GOES GLOBAL WITH SLIDES SUPPORT AND BETTER WAYS TO
FACT-CHECK (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google's NotebookLM, an AI research and writing assistant, is
expanding globally to over 200 countries and now supports Google
Slides and web URLs. The latest update, which utilizes Gemini 1.5 Pro,
offers new features like inline citations for easy fact-checking,
high-level source summaries, and the ability to ask questions about
images and charts. Marketers can leverage NotebookLM for diverse
applications, from creating newsletters and analyzing sales calls to
organizing complex storylines in writing projects.

 MARKETERS SHOULD STOP BEING FEARFUL OF REDDIT (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Many marketers are missing out on what Reddit has to offer due to a
lack of knowledge of the opportunities it presents. Non-salesy
community engagement, market research via social listening scans,
gathering customer feedback, and creator partnerships are all great
ways for brands to get value from the platform. At minimum, companies
should use Reddit to listen to customers and understand their needs,
but there is additional value gained from engaging with other users'
content or even creating posts. 

 MARKETERS ‚ÄòPREOCCUPIED WITH WRONG EFFECTIVENESS METRICS', STUDY
FINDS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Marketers have been overly focused on less meaningful campaign
metrics. Despite 92% of marketers claiming to distinguish these
effects, 39% of metrics used in 2023 were less meaningful. Campaigns
that avoid using campaign delivery effects in their reporting see a
67% improvement in business results. More effective measurement
methods include attribution modeling, brand tracking, and
econometrics. KPIs should ultimately align with campaign objectives,
document benchmarks, targets, performance, and key learnings for
future testing. 

 NO, THE GOOGLE ALGORITHM DID NOT LEAK (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The leaked information from Google was API documentation related to
ranking systems, not the actual algorithm. This documentation provides
insights into potential ranking signals, such as page views and toxic
links, which may influence Google's algorithm but are not guaranteed
factors. Marketers should interpret this information as part of a
broader strategy and prioritize foundational SEO practices, such as
optimizing for site speed, quality content, and user engagement,
rather than relying on supposed shortcuts or loopholes.
