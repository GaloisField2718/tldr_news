NEWS & TRENDS

 KENDRICK LAMAR'S CASH APP PARTNERSHIP SIGNALS A POWER SHIFT IN BRAND
MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Kendrick Lamar's Cash App partnership marks a shift from cultural
influence to infrastructural power, bypassing traditional banking
gatekeepers. The collaboration highlights how brands can move beyond
representation to create structural change, ensuring underserved
communities gain real access. It sets a precedent for industries like
fashion, sports, and film to prioritize community participation over
financial privilege. Advancements in digital banking and blockchain
enable direct artist-to-audience connections without reliance on
traditional institutions. Marketers should rethink diversity efforts,
prioritizing true collaboration with cultural leaders to build
inclusive systems rather than just using them for promotion. 

 THIS SCRAPPY SEARCH UPSTART IS GETTING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO GIVE UP
GOOGLE (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 As AI-generated content floods search results, Kagi is attracting
users with an ad-free, customizable search experience. With features
such as site-blocking, custom search filters, and an emphasis on
independent sources, Kagi's model aligns with user interests rather
than advertisers. Its success hinges on proving that people will pay
for a premium search experience in a market dominated by free options
with ads.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 REFERRALS ARE CONTAGIOUS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Customers coming from referrals make 27.65% more purchase trips than
non-referred customers. They are also 36% more likely to refer others,
creating a flywheel effect that drives growth. Incentives further
boost referrals - reminding referred customers of their referral
origin increased referrals by 21%, and pre-filled referral messages
with incentives raised rates by up to 53%. In a study of 51.7 million
customers, 19 out of 20 companies saw higher referral rates among
referred customers when both parties received a reward. To maximize
referrals, companies should use tiered incentives, track
referral-based conversions, and time referral requests after positive
customer experiences. 

 12 WAYS TO DO EFFECTIVE AUDIENCE RESEARCH (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Audience research is at the heart of a good marketing strategy. You
can uncover the language your audience uses to describe their
experiences by stepping into their shoes and learning what drives
them. Over 41% of marketers admit they don't conduct audience research
“nearly enough,” while only 19% do it monthly. This lack of
research has consequences, as a correlation exists between career
satisfaction and audience research - those who rarely conduct it are
less satisfied in their careers. To stay aligned with your audience,
include social listening, competitor analysis, and surveys, as well as
using tools like Google Alerts, SEMrush, and search intent analysis.

 OPENAI'S NEW DEEP RESEARCH AGENT CAN DO IN 5 MINUTES WHAT MIGHT TAKE
YOU HOURS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's Deep Research conducts in-depth research and generates
comprehensive reports in 5 to 30 minutes. It can browse the web,
analyze data, and synthesize findings into well-organized reports with
citations. OpenAI positions Deep Research as a tool for knowledge
workers in fields like finance, science, and policy. However, it still
requires human review due to occasional hallucinations and difficulty
distinguishing authoritative sources. Deep Research is currently
available only to ChatGPT Pro users for $200 per month. 

 ICON (TOOL) [11] 

 Icon.me streamlines the creation of advertising content. It analyzes
users' video libraries, tags scenes (i.e. unboxing), and uses these
clips as building blocks to generate ads. Users can input ideas into
AdGPT, an AI tool that crafts ads with matching clips for each scene,
producing content that's 80-99% complete. Further refinements can be
made using AdCut, an editing tool. 

 LINKEDIN ROLLS OUT UPDATES TO VIDEO PRESENTATION AND DISCOVERY (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 LinkedIn is doubling down on video with expanded full-screen
playback, a swipeable video search carousel, and profile enhancements
for video creators. Video content is now displayed more prominently in
the feed and new analytics provide deeper audience insights into watch
time and engagement. LinkedIn has also introduced free courses
covering video creation, editing, and repurposing strategies.

 TWITCH HAS PLENTY OF COMPETITION IN THE LIVESTREAM ECONOMY (5 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Twitch remains committed to strict content moderation, maintaining
policies against hate, harassment, and crypto gambling. While some
creators moved to Kick, financial incentives were a bigger factor than
moderation policies. Twitch rolled back its exclusivity clause to
support a creator-first approach, recognizing that viewers follow
their favorite streamers rather than the platform itself. Twitch will
continue to expand its creator base as livestreaming grows as it
believes that attracting new talent will keep it competitive. 

 "BUY NOW, PAY LATER" INCREASES CUSTOMER SPENDING (3 MINUTE READ) [14]

billion by 2027. Research shows BNPL increases both purchase frequency
and spending (order value) by reducing perceived financial constraints
and making budgeting easier. Retailers using BNPL see a 9% increase in
purchase incidence and a 10% rise in purchase amounts, highlighting
its potential impact on consumer behavior.
