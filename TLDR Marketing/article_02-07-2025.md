NEWS & TRENDS

 WHAT DOES “AUTHENTICITY” MEAN IN THE AGE OF AI? (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 62% of consumers say they would trust brands more if those brands
were transparent about their use of AI. As generative tools become
central to the creative process, the meaning of authenticity is
shifting from an emphasis on human authorship to the quality and
emotional impact of the final output. Designers are adjusting by using
AI as a collaborative tool and focusing on crafting work that aligns
with brand values and audience expectations. 

 PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING MORE, BUT NOT JUST ON GOOGLE (3 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Google's market share has dropped below 90% for the first time since
2015, while 76% of people now use social media to search. The rise of
AI in search is shrinking visibility for brands by limiting page 1
results through AI Overviews. At the same time, user behavior is
expanding search beyond Google, with more people using platforms like
TikTok and Instagram to find information.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 APRILYNNE ALTER REVEALS HOW TO MAKE A KILLER YOUTUBE INTRO (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Aprilynne Alter's approach to creating YouTube intros focuses on
meeting audience expectations within the first 30 seconds by
delivering both the “plot promise” (what the video is about) and
the “format promise” (the video type). She recommends establishing
a clear Unique Service Proposition early, such as showcasing expertise
or proof of effort, to set the video apart. Intros should be concise,
no longer than 40 seconds, and provide just enough context to engage
viewers. 

 NEWSLETTER GROWTH TIPS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To grow a newsletter with Meta ads on just $20 per day, start by
creating a website lead campaign to control the signup experience and
improve engagement. Set up one campaign with two ad sets using broad
targeting, splitting your budget evenly. Use 3 images and 3 videos
across both ad sets, then let them run for 5-7 days. Keep the
best-performing creatives in the main ad set and test 3–6 new ones
weekly in the second. Monetize by using paid recommendations like
Beehiiv Boosts or SparkLoop Upscribe to earn about $0.50 per
subscriber and offset ad spend.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 WHY “AI SHARE BUTTONS” MIGHT BE THE SMARTEST GROWTH HACK: THE
CITEMET METHOD (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google-driven traffic is declining. AI engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Claude are emerging as new discovery layers. AI share
buttons on websites can help users interact with content through LLMs,
which can lead to citations, increased brand memory, and passive
traffic growth. These buttons pass specific prompts and URLs directly
to AI platforms, making it easier for content to be summarized,
remembered, and referenced. The method, called CiteMET (Cited,
Memorable, Effective, and Trackable), is part of a broader strategy to
future-proof visibility by influencing how AI engines process and cite
content. While technical SEO is still essential, this approach builds
a new form of audience engagement through AI prompt interaction. 

 HOW MILLENNIALS USE SOCIAL MEDIA: WHAT MARKETERS NEED TO KNOW (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Millennials are reemerging in cultural relevance and remain a
dominant force on social media, with 31% planning to increase usage in
2025. They value emotional connection, authenticity, and originality,
using platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok for
entertainment, shopping, and staying connected. Over half make impulse
purchases monthly from social media, and 35% are more likely to buy
products discovered there during economic uncertainty. They favor
brand content that feels personal and avoid anything that sounds
overly polished or sales-focused. To win them over, brands should
prioritize storytelling, community engagement, and a consistent,
relatable voice.

 MARKETING IS BROKEN: WHY YOU'RE SO BUSY AND STILL NOT GETTING
ANYTHING DONE (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Marketing teams lose 7.5 hours each week to performative tasks and
another 4.6 hours to poor communication. Over 55% say constant
notifications disrupt their focus. To reclaim time, block at least 2
hours per day for deep work and replace status meetings with async
updates. Although 86% use AI tools, only 5% feel fluent, missing a
major opportunity. Use AI to handle briefs, meeting summaries, and
internal updates. Create templates for repeatable tasks and shift
focus to execution that is high-impact. 

 SHOULD YOUR BRAND OPEN A COFFEE SHOP? (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Brands from luxury fashion to banks are opening coffee shops to
expand their reach beyond traditional buyers. These cafés create
“third places” where people can spend time, increasing dwell time
and chances of purchases. Coffee shops like Uniqlo's Fifth Avenue
location and Dior's Blue Box Café generate social media buzz through
Instagrammable spaces and UGC. While costly and requiring quality
service, partnering with established coffee roasters can reduce risks.


 THE NEED FOR A NEW TRIO: PM, PMM, AND GROWTH (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Product development has become faster and more accessible with AI,
but that shift increases the pressure on teams to get positioning,
messaging, and distribution right. A modern product team needs three
core roles working in sync with the Product Manager defining and
building the product, the Product Marketing Manager connecting it to
market needs, and the Growth Owner optimizing reach and impact. This
trio expands the influence of product beyond technical teams and
ensures that customer insights and business goals stay connected
throughout the entire product lifecycle.
