 WE NEED TO LEAVE THESE 10 MARKETING VICES IN 2024 (7 MINUTE READ) [4]


 “Marketing vices" feel important but don't actually contribute to
marketing goals. These include social listening, as online backlash
often lacks alignment with broader consumer sentiment. AI has already
transformed marketing. Consistency beats unnecessary change, with
research showing consistent brands generate ads twice as effective and
27% more impactful. Effective advertising prioritizes energy and
emotion over dull rationality, with research indicating engaging ads
save approximately £10m in media spend for equivalent market impact.
Marketing in 2025 should emphasize creative consistency and emotional
storytelling and focus on fame-driving content. 

 INSIDE NETFLIX'S HUGE EXPERIENTIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN FOR 'SQUID
GAME' (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Squid Game season 2 success, with 68 million views in just three
days, was driven by Netflix's extensive experiential marketing, which
included events across 25 countries and six continents. Highlights
included the Paris "Red Light, Green Light" game, a 4.56K run in Los
Angeles, and "Squid Game: The Experience" in NYC, all designed to
immerse fans in the show's dystopian world. The campaign's global
reach and interactive elements reignited audience excitement and
established a new standard for entertainment marketing.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE TRIGGER TECHNIQUE: TURN BUYER STORIES INTO SMARTER MARKETING
CAMPAIGNS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Shackleton's recruitment ad highlights the power of clarity and focus
in marketing. Modern marketing struggles with soaring costs and
ineffective targeting, as 85% of marketers lack the information to
reach their audience effectively. The Trigger Technique transforms
customer stories into actionable insights, helping marketers identify
"trigger events" that prompt purchases. Interviews with recent
best-fit buyers uncover their needs, pains, and motivations, which are
used to design targeted campaigns that resonate. By running
hyper-targeted experiments and collaborating with teams, marketers can
craft compelling offers and achieve significant growth with minimal
resources. 

 DEEP DIVE: MISDIRECTION MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Misdirection Marketing uses intentional mistakes to boost engagement
and generate buzz. On social media, it drives comments; in emails, it
improves open and read rates; and in traditional media, it can create
earned media coverage. Examples include typos in email subject lines,
"leaked" promotional emails, and playful errors in social posts.
Successful campaigns include Virgin Voyages' Black Friday email stunt,
Lululemon's "We Made Too Much" sale rebranding, and Hostess'
sports-themed social media mix-up. While effective for engagement,
overuse risks damaging a brand's reputation, so this tactic is best
reserved for occasional, well-executed campaigns. 

 WHAT'S OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN 2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Break away from strict brand guidelines and shift from teaching to
facilitating collaboration. Prioritize community engagement by
actively responding to feedback and involving audiences. Diversify
content formats like carousels, newsletters, and Threads to avoid
video fatigue. Replace generic strategies with personalized
approaches, relying on intuition for creative decisions. Focus on
immersive, non-sales content and seek inspiration from a variety of
sources to stay ahead of trends.

 HOW TO USE LINKEDIN NEWSLETTERS: A GUIDE FOR BUSINESSES (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 LinkedIn has over 1 billion users, but fewer than 100,000 active
newsletters, which creates a somewhat low-competition channel.
Built-in tools help distribute content through email, notifications,
and the newsfeed, allowing marketers to maximize visibility and
engagement without starting from zero. Strategies such as publishing
content directly from personal profiles or company pages, maintaining
optimal frequency (weekly to monthly for profiles, more frequently for
company pages), and using LinkedIn's profile features and
cross-platform promotions can help grow the subscriber list and
enhance brand visibility.

 HOW TOP REVIEWERS SKEW ONLINE RATINGS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Experienced reviewers are consistently more critical when rating
high-quality products, with 98% of these products receiving lower
scores than expected based on the average reviewer. A study analyzing
millions of ratings found this bias results from stricter standards
among knowledgeable users, distorting average scores. When analyzing
customer reviews, it is important to adjust for reviewer strictness to
create more accurate evaluations.
