NEWS & TRENDS

 CHATGPT SHOPPING IS COMING (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Developers found Shopify code references in ChatGPT's JavaScript this
month, suggesting a possible new integration. Shopify has previously
worked with AI, as seen in its partnership with Perplexity's "Buy with
Pro" feature launched in November 2024. AI shopping tools like
Perplexity and Microsoft's Copilot currently offer organic product
placement without merchant payment, but paid listings may emerge. The
future of AI shopping could either fragment across many tools or
concentrate around platforms like Shopify through strategic
partnerships. 

 HOW STABILITY BECAME ‘THE NEW LUXURY' (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 72% of consumers now prefer stability over constant innovation.
Consistency has become a new form of luxury. Even as AI interest
grows, people seek brands that offer calm, trust, and clear value
rather than disruption. Marketers now need to prioritize transparent
AI use, balance functional innovation with human connection, and avoid
falling into a homogenized “generative middle” that ends up
alienating audiences.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 1PASSWORD'S REDDIT-BASED APPROACH TO USER RETENTION (7 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Many brands miss Reddit's real value by only posting content, but
1Password uses it for direct customer feedback and relationship
building. Its r/1Password subreddit, with 39K subscribers, is managed
with clear navigation, active employee engagement, and a detailed
flair system to organize discussions. About 46% of 1Password's social
traffic comes from Reddit, and community-driven posts often receive
over 200 upvotes. The subreddit helps 1Password identify product gaps,
communicate responsive feature updates, and foster a knowledgeable
community that promotes and defends the brand. 

 HOW SHUTTERFLY USED A SEARCH-POWERED CUSTOM ALGORITHM TO ZOOM IN ON
NEW CUSTOMERS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Shutterfly's new customer ROAS grew from $0.31 to $1.49 between
October and December by using a search-data-driven custom algorithm.
Unlike traditional addressable tactics, the algorithm prioritized
geographic regions showing early purchase intent but low Shutterfly
brand recognition. This shifted ad spend away from major cities to
smaller, high-potential markets. By optimizing weekly, the campaign
improved both cost efficiency and customer acquisition outcomes
without relying on traditional deterministic identifiers like
demographics.

 DRAFT.CO (TOOL) [8]

writers. Submit a request through the platform describing what you

 HOW TO DO A PPC COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS USING AI (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A competitive PPC analysis helps you see which keywords competitors
bid on, what ads they run, and their estimated budgets. Using tools
like Ahrefs and AI models such as ChatGPT, the method involves
identifying competitors, gathering paid keyword and ad data, compiling
your own data, downloading landing pages as PDFs, and running an AI
project for full analysis. AI identifies keyword gaps, suggests quick
wins, and can build a full PPC action plan from the data. For
non-Google platforms, ad libraries and tools like AdBeat offer limited
but useful creative insights.

 THE CATCH-22 OF MODERN MARKETING CAMPAIGNS: ‘WE ARE TARGETING OUR
WAY TO OBLIVION' (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Disney Advertising handles 4-5 billion ad impressions weekly across
Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN and processes 50K ad creatives monthly. Some
executives believe that hyper-targeting can limit growth. Marketers
need to balance global reach with local strategies, as success in key
regions can translate into global impact. 

 YOUR SUBSCRIBERS ARE TIRED AND DISTRACTED, SO GIVE THEM LESS AND
THEY'LL LOVE YOU MORE (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Attention spans now average just 47 seconds, creating challenges for
traditional email newsletters. Instead of scheduled roundups,
marketers are moving towards focused, needs-driven emails that trigger
based on user actions and have a clear and immediate value. Emails
that state their purpose in the subject line and focus on one pressing
need are also more likely to survive inbox fatigue and earn customer
engagement.
