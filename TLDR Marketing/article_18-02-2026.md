NEWS & TRENDS

 NEW DATA SHOWS #AD ON INFLUENCER CONTENT DOES NOT HARM ENGAGEMENT (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Research shows that explicit ad disclosure on influencer content does
not harm engagement on Instagram. In many cases, it actually improves
performance. Posts with #AD generate higher median likes and comments
across all UK influencer tiers. For creators with over 500K followers,
disclosure acts as a credibility and legitimacy signal rather than
limiting reach. The findings debunk the belief that platforms downrank
sponsored content. 

 SNAPCHAT LAUNCHES CREATOR SUBSCRIPTIONS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Snapchat is launching Creator Subscriptions to give creators
recurring income and give fans paid access to exclusive content and
ad-free Stories. The program will start on February 23 in alpha
testing with select US creators and then expand to Canada, the UK, and
France. Subscribers get exclusive Snaps and Stories, priority replies,
and no ads in that creator's Stories. Creators can set their own
monthly prices within recommended tiers. Early participating creators
include Jeremiah Brown, Harry Jowsey, and Skai Jackson. 

 THE NEXT UGC: CONTENT LOYALTY PROGRAMS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Content loyalty programs reward customers for posting social content.
They are becoming a new way for brands to drive user-generated content
and demand. 92% of consumers trust user-generated content over ads.
Brands can use CRM portals to collect posts and give points, perks,
and exclusive access in return. A program built by Ogilvy for Nestlé
in Vietnam for the Milo brand signed up 2,600 creators, produced 3,100
submissions, and reached 78 million video views.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WIN REPORT: HOW REMOVING FRICTION INCREASED PAID SUBSCRIPTIONS BY 13%
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mobbin increased paid subscriptions by 13% after it replaced a static
paywall banner with a sticky header that kept the ‘Get Pro'
call-to-action visible during scrolling. User testing showed that free
users often scrolled far down the page and lost sight of the paywall
prompt at the moment they were ready to subscribe. The variation kept
the banner fixed at the top, updated the asset count to show full Pro
value, and added social proof that said it supports over 1M designers.
The test shows that reducing decision friction and keeping contextual
CTAs visible can lift conversions. 

 THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO QUESTION MINING (40 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Question mining is the practice of systematically finding and
prioritizing the real questions that shape buying decisions. It
focuses especially on the ones rooted in uncertainty rather than
simple curiosity. Visibility today depends less on ranking pages and
more on whose explanations get synthesized and reused. Teams need a
continuous system that captures questions from sales, reviews, and
search, filters for decision impact, and turns them into canonical
answers. The goal is to consistently reduce ambiguity so your
explanation becomes the default reference across AI, search, and sales
conversations.

 This tool turns any Substack into a printable newspaper. 

 NEW FEATURE IN LINKEDIN CAMPAIGN MANAGER (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 LinkedIn Campaign Manager now lets advertisers benchmark performance
beyond simple period comparisons with 2 new views. Industry benchmark
compares ad sets to similar advertisers over the past 90 days, while
self benchmark compares similar ad sets within the same account over
the same period. This upgrade provides context that month-over-month
changes and generic averages could not, revealing whether performance
is truly under or above the market. The feature is still rolling out
to all accounts.

 DON'T OVERESTIMATE YOUR CUSTOMERS' SATISFACTION (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Managers often misjudge how satisfied their customers are and
misunderstand what drives that satisfaction. Research across 70,000
customer surveys and 1,068 manager responses showed managers
overestimated satisfaction by 4.1%, repurchase intent by 4.9%, and
customer expectations by about 3% to 4%, while underestimating
complaints by 30%. It also found that managers undervalued the role of
product quality for both satisfaction and perceived value, and
misjudged how satisfaction reduces complaints. Bias and internal
optimism often distort how leaders read customer data, which leads to
poor decisions about retention and experience. Companies like Loom
show that better survey design and more personal outreach can lift
spending by up to 32.9% and reduce churn. 

 WHY EVERYONE PROMPTS AI DIFFERENTLY (EVEN WHEN THEY WANT THE SAME
THING) (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A small experiment showed that even people with the same goal write
very different AI prompts. Larger research confirms that prompts
sharing the same intent rarely look alike. People add context,
constraints, and personal nuance instead of reducing the need to tidy
keywords. Despite wide variation in wording, AI systems often detect
the underlying intent and return similar recommendations. The key is
to focus less on specific prompts and more on understanding how people
naturally describe their problems. Then create content that reflects
that language across the web. 

 THE PATH TO PURCHASE JUST GOT DRAMATICALLY SHORTER (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Holiday data shows the funnel compressing as more purchases occur at
or near first exposure. Retail sales rose 4.1% year over year from
Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, with ecommerce up 10.4%, despite
economic pressure. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram are capturing
more budget because discovery and checkout happen in one environment,
enabling immediate conversion. Brands are seeing stronger performance
from upper funnel media as targeting improves and standardized
checkout reduces friction.
