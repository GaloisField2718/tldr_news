TLDR MARKETING 2026-02-04

 69% OF YOUR BEST CUSTOMERS ARE ONE MISTAKE AWAY FROM
LEAVING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The era of "brand forgiveness" is over, especially for the customers
you can't afford to lose. New global research from the Oliver Wyman
Forum shows 69% of high-income consumers will switch brands after a
single bad experience.

AI now shapes product discovery, and community voices shape trust more
than paid campaigns. Marketing leaders who focus only on acquisition
risk losing their most profitable users at the first friction point.
The 300,000 Voices report reveals how to win the next generation of
consumers by creating experiences they trust and value.

NEWS & TRENDS

 THE CREATOR ADVANTAGE 2026 (19 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Using the VIT framework (Volume, Frequency, Impact, and Trust),
brands now prioritize relevance over raw numbers. While most
industries saw performance declines despite hiring more influencers,
Beauty stood out with a 22% VIT increase by focusing on retention.
Smaller voices are driving this shift. Nano-creators saw a 50% VIT
surge in high-intent actions like saves. They're moving away from
cookie-cutter posts toward authentic, creator-led systems that reward
consistency. 

 SHORT SUPER BOWL AD TEASERS MISS THE EMOTIONAL MARK, SYSTEM1 ANALYSIS
FINDS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Short Super Bowl ad teasers create weaker emotional impact than
longer ads and reduce campaign effectiveness. Analysis across six
years shows teaser spots score about 0.5 Stars lower than full length
ads because viewers have less time to connect and build memory. The
research finds that 20 to 40 second ads perform best, and brands
should start Super Bowl campaigns in January and continue running ads
after the game to extend impact. A 30 second Super Bowl ad now costs
about $8 million, so it is important for a brand to run longer pre
game ads and keep top performers in rotation, as seen in a 5.9 Star
rated Lay's ad that still airs a year later.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE PERFECT PITCH: WHAT MILLIONS OF EMAILS TAUGHT US ABOUT PITCHING
JOURNALISTS (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Short email pitches drive the best journalist engagement. Emails with
100 to 300 word bodies get the highest open rates and reply rates,
while emails under 300 words earn the most replies. About 50% of
pitches paste a full press release into the email body, which is
mainly a UK practice, while US pitches more often use short plain
text. Personalization varies in depth, as 83% use the journalist's
name but only 57% reference past articles, and shallow flattery often
fails. Relevant connections to prior coverage work better. Strong
pitches usually start with a timely stat or trend hook, give a clear
headline takeaway, include about four bolded bullet points, and add
expert quotes that explain why the findings matter instead of
repeating the data. 

 DINNERS ARE THE NEW TRADE SHOWS (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dinners are becoming more scalable than sponsoring trade shows
because they're more targeted. They should be treated as a core
channel, not just a social outing. Apply the same strategic rigor and
high-quality data to these events as you would to any other GTM
motion.

 HOW TO USE CLAUDE & GAMMA TO MAKE A DECK (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 To make slides with Claude, go to claude.ai and connect Gamma and
Google Drive via "Connectors". Then prompt Claude to create a deck,
pulling relevant Drive docs and web graphics. Answer a few questions
about format, tone, and length, and edit heavily through Gamma if
needed. For branded slides, skip Gamma's default templates, create
your own style in Gamma. Save fonts, colors, and logo placement. Then
prompt Claude to use that style so every deck reflects your brand.

 WHAT MAKES A NEWSLETTER WORTH OPENING? (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Beehiiv's State of Newsletters 2026 report highlights that 28B emails
were sent in 2025, yet engagement increased, reinforcing newsletters
as a reliable owned channel. Readers favor concise subject lines,
straightforward “here's what you need to know” framing, and strong
opening sentences that justify the click. Consistency in send time and
format builds habit, while misleading urgency language and surprise
paywalls actively hurt performance. 

 THE “MOORE-ISH” LAW OF MARKETING (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Marketing is shifting from campaign launches to continuous systems as
the cost and speed of experimentation collapse. AI reduces the effort
to generate and deploy variations, pushing advantage toward teams that
can measure results and make fast decisions. Content moves from single
assets to always-on streams built from modular components, while
personalization shifts from static segments to real-time situations
like objections or constraints. Winning teams focus less on producing
volume and more on building pipelines that test and learn based on
compounding insights. 

 LIGHT BEER WAS A FLOP, UNTIL THE RIGHT ADVERTISING CAME ALONG (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Early light beers failed not because of taste or formulation, but
because marketing framed them around dieting rather than enjoyment.
Miller Lite broke through in the 1970s by repositioning light beer as
less filling with great taste, using sports figures and barroom humor
instead of health language. That shift created a mass-market category
that later powered brands like Bud Light and Michelob Ultra to
category leadership.
