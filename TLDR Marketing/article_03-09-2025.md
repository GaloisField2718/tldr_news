NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE WON'T HAVE TO SELL CHROME OR ANDROID, BUT HAS TO SHARE SEARCH
DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google avoided a forced sell-off of Chrome or Android after the court
ruled these products were not directly used to maintain its search
monopoly. However, the ruling introduces a major shift by requiring
Google to share parts of its search index and user-interaction data
with qualified competitors. This opens the door for rivals to improve
their own search products, potentially impacting search ad performance
and traffic dynamics over time. 

 HOW OFTEN DO AI ASSISTANTS HALLUCINATE LINKS? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI assistants send visitors to 404 pages 2.87X more often than Google
search. ChatGPT had the highest 404 rates, with 1.01% of clicked URLs
and 2.38% of cited URLs returning errors, compared to Google's 0.15%
and 0.84%. Claude, Copilot, Perplexity, and Gemini had lower error
rates, with Mistral being the lowest, but based on the smallest
sample. Many errors stem from outdated links or hallucinated URLs that
mimic real site structures but never existed. The study suggests using
analytics to identify these links and either redirecting traffic or
improving 404 pages to help visitors. 

 RETAIL PANIC: WHAT THE END OF THE ‘DE MINIMIS' EXEMPTION MEANS FOR
BRANDS ACROSS THE GLOBE (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The sudden end of the US de minimis exemption, which allowed
shipments under $800 to enter duty-free, is disrupting global retail
supply chains. It will raise costs for businesses and increase prices
for consumers. Initially set to expire in 2027, the policy was
abruptly terminated by executive order, impacting companies from small
Etsy sellers to major brands like Tapestry and Lululemon that had
built business models around it. Used by e-commerce giants like Shein
and Temu, the exemption's removal is forcing businesses to restructure
logistics, delay shipments, and, in some cases, halt US sales.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THIS DEV TIKTOK FORMAT KEEPS GOING VIRAL (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Buildspace founder Farza is growing Tidbit by using TikTok to share
build-in-public and dev-focused content. It currently has 4.3M views
across 40 videos driving 16% of signups. The most viral post used the
hook, “Just noticed my coworker coding. NO Cursor. NO Windsurf. He's
just sitting there typing code manually and reading documentation.
What a psychopath”, a format that has also gone viral in other
niches. Build-in-public content shouldn't be underestimated as a
growth driver for early-stage prosumer and B2B products. 

 THE COUNTERINTUITIVE MODEL: THE GROWTH MODEL THAT OUTPERFORMS
FREEMIUM AND FREE TRIALS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Most SaaS startups struggle with free users converting, as freemium
models only convert about 2-5% and traditional trials lose around 75%
of signups after expiration. A reverse trial gives new users full
premium access for a limited period, then downgrades them to a free
tier if they do not upgrade, combining acquisition benefits of
freemium with conversion benefits of trials. Companies like Canva,
Toggl Track, and Grammarly use this model successfully, with Toggl
Track reporting doubled premium revenue after switching. Reverse
trials work best when the key value sits behind paid features,
onboarding is complex, or standout features need early exposure. 

 SHOPIFY SEO TIP: HOW GOOGLE CRAWLS PRODUCTS TO MAP RANKINGS AND
CLICKS (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google treats the first few products in a Shopify collection as
“signature items”. This influences Shopping rankings, crawl
priority, and snippets like “Popular products”. To increase SEO
visibility, keep evergreen, keyword-rich SKUs in the top spots, add
structured data for reviews and pricing, rotate seasonal items without
displacing anchors, and align top products with SKUs already surfaced
in SERPs.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 DISTRIBUTION BEFORE PRODUCT: THE OPERATOR'S 90-DAY GTM PLAYBOOK -
WITH AI PROMPTS (23 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Most startups fail because they lack distribution, not because their
products are bad. Customer acquisition costs have risen 300-400% in
the past 3 years, stretching CAC payback periods to 18-24 months,
which makes traditional paid marketing unsustainable.
Distribution-first companies succeed by building owned channels,
audiences, and credibility before launching products, using tactics
like waitlists, viral loops, and shareable templates. Case studies
such as Suno, Robinhood, and Notion show that strategies like
community-driven growth, gamified referrals, and viral content can
drive rapid adoption. A structured 90-day playbook helps founders
build compounding distribution assets that reduce CAC by at least 40%
and create defensible growth advantages. 

 HOW TO QUICKLY CREATE QUALITY MUSIC AND VIDEO (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Music platforms like Udio and Suno allow marketers to define tone,
instruments, and vocals with simple text prompts. Visuals begin with
quick image generation in Midjourney and evolve into animated assets
that fit the overall concept with tools like Runway. By starting with
music, teams can set the emotional and structural foundation for the
final product, then assemble everything in editing software like
Premiere to ensure quality and consistency.

 SEARCH BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO ORGANIC SOCIAL FOR BRANDS (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Social media is being used as a search tool rather than just for
passive scrolling. In fact, 24% of TikTok users search within 30
seconds of opening the app. Search allows brands to capture
intent-driven engagement, while the feed remains more useful for brand
building and short-term visibility. Feed content usually lasts up to 7
days, but search content can stay relevant for 9 to 12 months. Brands
may benefit from using both approaches, though some may prioritize
search depending on their strategic goals. 

 HOW TO LAUNCH YOUR STARTUP OUT OF STEALTH, FROM FIGMA'S FIRST
MARKETER (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The structure of a successful launch begins with a firm date, which
forces prioritization and reveals the most essential product and
messaging decisions. From there, creating foundational assets such as
a homepage and founder-led announcement post transforms abstract
positioning into clear and testable narratives. These materials help
align internal stakeholders while offering a consistent message to the
market. In the absence of media reach, the best approach is to have
the early distribution led by the founder and reinforced through
trusted personal networks.
