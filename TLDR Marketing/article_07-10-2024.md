NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE'S GRIP ON SEARCH SLIPS AS TIKTOK AND AI STARTUP MOUNT
CHALLENGE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's share of the US search ad market is projected to fall below
50% for the first time in over a decade. With increased competition
from TikTok, Amazon, and Perplexity, and the legal pressures
surrounding Google's antitrust issues, many advertisers are exploring
alternatives for their ad spending. 

 ‚ÄòDUMB PHONES' HAVE NO APPS OR INTERNET (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The trend of switching to "dumb phones," or basic flip phones, is
gaining traction as individuals seek to combat feelings of
overstimulation and anxiety from their smartphones. This movement is
popular among Gen Z and parents who want to limit their children's
exposure to social media while still providing a means of
communication. Users report increased presence and deeper
relationships after making the switch.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ARE YOU MAKING THIS WEBSITE MISTAKE? (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Distractions on pages like checkout and demo forms can hurt
conversions. Common mistakes include using too many colors, making
logos clickable, and having footers filled with links, which divert
users away from the intended action. To fix this, simplify designs by
muting non-essential images to grayscale, making logos static, and
removing or minimizing footers. These changes help reduce exit
opportunities and keep users focused on completing the conversion
process. 

 HOW TO GET STARTED WITH USER-GENERATED CONTENT (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Engage power users to create high-quality content. Focus on building
a small, curated marketplace where content meets user demand. Track
key metrics, like creator engagement and content views, and use
distribution channels like newsletters, social media, and in-app
integration to drive traffic. Over time, automate the submission
process and leverage UGC to boost SEO, engagement, and retention,
creating a content ecosystem that's hard for AI to replicate. 

 A/B PLATFORMS: ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A/B testing provides quick insights on one change, while multivariate
testing reveals how different elements interact. Continuous testing
loops and feedback loops optimize performance by iterating tests based
on real-time data and user behavior. A common misconception is that
A/B testing is always simpler, whereas multivariate testing requires
more traffic and time. Start with A/B for low traffic or simple
changes, and use multivariate for complex scenarios.

 2-STEP FUNNEL PROBLEMS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The 2-step funnel strategy in Meta ads, where one campaign is
optimized for clicks and another targets conversions, is often
inefficient. The initial campaign usually brings in low-quality
traffic, which lowers the effectiveness of the second. Meta's
algorithm now prioritizes remarketing automatically, making manual
segmentation both less necessary and more expensive. 

 BRANDED KEYWORDS: HOW GOOGLE ADS DRIVES UP CPCS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The cost-per-click for branded keywords has more than doubled in 2023
due to Google's shift toward AI-powered auctions and PMax campaigns.
These changes have increased competition on branded queries, forcing
businesses to bid against competitors and pushing organic listings
lower. As a result, companies are spending more on branded traffic
while seeing reduced returns on those ad dollars. 

 HOW HE TURNED A $200 LANDING PAGE INTO A 7-FIGURE AGENCY (12 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Zeroqode scaled rapidly by using guerrilla marketing, pulling off a
high-profile stunt at TechCrunch Disrupt, and cloning popular apps to
attract attention. The company also focused on content marketing,
giveaways, and creating side projects to enhance visibility.
Challenges included training talent for no-code work and operating on
a tight budget. Despite this, the company achieved a significant
market share in Bubble's plugin marketplace through creative and
cost-effective approaches.
