 LINKEDIN TARGETS USERS CAUGHT BETWEEN TIKTOK AND WHAT USED TO BE
TWITTER (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 By introducing games and short-form content, LinkedIn seems to be
strategically targeting users who find themselves lost between TikTok
and the transformed Twitter. It is trying to position itself as a
unique blend of professional networking and engaging content for a
broader audience. 

 THAT VIRAL AI-GENERATED INFLUENCER IS BASED ON A REAL PERSON. AND
SHE‚ÄôS FINE WITH THE ADS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A video went viral showing a woman ranting about ‚Äústanky body
odor‚Äù while sitting in the front seat of a car. The woman, suspected
of being an AI-generated influencer, has been revealed to be based on
a real person, Ariel Marie. She consented for Arcads to use her
likeness in a generative video tool that was then developed to create
a video advertising hygienic wipes. Marie‚Äôs involvement has sparked
discussions on ethical concerns and the boundary between reality and
artificiality.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE ENDLESS COPYWRITING CYCLE FRAMEWORK (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most marketers write copy and then never look at it again, rather
than optimizing for additional upside. The Endless Copywriting Cycle
framework proposes marketers follow 4 steps: research and discover,
write and publish, validate and test, then repeat. With each
iteration, brands develop more learnings, a higher conversion rate,
and increased revenue. 

 HOW TO USE BENEFITS AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Brand benefits can be leveraged as a strategic tool for business
differentiation and growth. By focusing the communication on customer
needs and outcomes rather than features, companies can set themselves
apart from their competitors. Benefits can be functional if they
provide practical advantages, symbolic if they appeal to the
customer's values and aspirations, or experiential if they focus on
sensory or emotional aspects. This article shares insights on how to
apply benefits to marketing efforts and to grow brand recognition. 

 DISTRIBUTE IDEAS, NOT CONTENT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article underscores the importance of focusing the content
strategy on a central idea. By aligning all efforts around a central
theme, marketers create a cohesive brand narrative that reinforces the
messaging and drives more engagement. A complex content strategy makes
it harder to connect with the audience. The author uses Freshpaint, a
healthcare data platform, as an example of how to center content
around a big idea. The platform made its brand all about privacy-first
marketing and became a successful thought leader in the industry.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 12-POINT SEO CONTENT UPDATE CHECKLIST (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Optimize existing assets instead of constantly reinventing the wheel
by creating new content. Check the last 28 days of your Google Search
Console and highlight relevant search queries that rank between #4 to
#20. You can optimize these pages by adding new insights to refresh
the topics, adding new internal links to recently published articles,
replacing or adding new images, updating CTAs, or reviewing outbound
links. 

 DRIVING GROWTH WITH ‚ÄòVOICE OF CUSTOMER‚Äô DATA: A STEP-BY-STEP
APPROACH (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Developing a repeatable process for collecting and summarizing
‚Äòvoice of customer‚Äô data enables brands to pinpoint and solve
growth problems. Set up a process to gather data, process it, create a
repository, share results, and repeat. This information can then be
used to refine your messaging, validate channel investments, and
inform sales strategies.

 7 B2B BUYING TRENDS TO UNDERSTAND (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Taking buying trends and mechanisms into consideration will help you
sell your product more effectively. This post describes 7 trends in
the current B2B market that brands should understand. Most of your
target market isn‚Äôt ready to buy at this moment, which is why you
need marketing tactics for short-term, medium-term, and long-term
revenue. The way B2B executives buy is influenced by many factors and
touch points, so marketing strategies need to account for a nonlinear
buying journey. Buying something is a project, and projects can fail
for reasons outside of a brand‚Äôs control. 

 HOW TO CREATE A STANDOUT CELEBRITY AD CAMPAIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Partnering with celebrities is a popular marketing strategy, but it
is expensive and not a guaranteed success. This article describes 3
necessary ingredients for a celebrity campaign to succeed, using
Calvin Klein‚Äôs partnership with Jeremy Allen White as a case study.
Your chosen celebrity should align with what you want to convey as a
brand or product, rather than simply being the current ‚Äòit‚Äô celeb.
Partnering with talent who already uses your product helps develop a
campaign that feels authentic. The media strategy around the
partnership is critical, whether that‚Äôs launching the campaign
before the celebrity‚Äôs tour or timing it around a relevant and large
event. 

 SHIFTING POSITIONING - WHY B2B TECH IS DIFFERENT (4 MINUTE READ) [14]


 Consumer products typically maintain consistent positioning
strategies over time. For example, Wrigley‚Äôs Juicy Fruit gum has had
the same positioning since the 1890s. When Wrigley targeted new
markets, it didn‚Äôt reposition Juicy Fruit. Instead, it launched
entirely new products to serve those markets. B2B products frequently
undergo shifts in positioning throughout their lifespan. This is
because B2B companies are constantly adapting to evolving features and
target markets as part of their product roadmap. It is important for
B2B teams to have processes in place to review positioning regularly
and account for downstream changes when positioning changes.
