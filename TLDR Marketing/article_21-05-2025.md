 HOW BLAND AI SCALED TO 10,000 INBOUND LEADS ON DEFAULT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When Bland's AI phone agent went viral, the company found itself with
a massive influx of inbound leads.

Good problem to have? Yes. But not handling these leads correctly
meant leaving a LOT of money on the table.

Isaiah Granet, Bland's CEO, wanted to solve this problem before their
next big marketing campaign. This led them to Default [4].

See how Bland used Default for:

→ Automated inbound scheduling and qualification that runs within
1/10th of a second

→ Consolidating their GTM stack - forms, demo scheduling,
enrichment, attribution…

→ 22% higher conversion rates and 10x better demo meetings.

NEWS & TRENDS

 INSTAGRAM OFFERS CREATORS UP TO $20,000 IN NEW REFERRAL PROGRAM TO
ATTRACT USERS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Instagram has launched a 6-week, invite-only referral program
offering select US-based creators up to $20K for driving new users or
traffic to the platform via links shared outside the app. Participants
can earn $100 per eligible sign-up or per 1K eligible visits. The
initiative encourages creators to promote Instagram on rival platforms
like TikTok, YouTube, and Substack. As part of Meta's broader push to
retain creator loyalty amid increasing competition, this test follows
previous incentives like the “Breakthrough Bonus” and exclusive
content deals. 

 WHY IT'S TIME FOR MORE FEMALE CREATIVE DIRECTORS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Only 12% of creative directors in the UK are women, and the number is
even lower when factoring in class and ethnicity. Systemic barriers,
from rigid workplace norms to caregiving responsibilities and biased
leadership expectations, make it difficult for women to enter and
advance in creative leadership. Flexible work environments like Born
Social have shown that inclusion strengthens teams and leads to more
effective, emotionally intelligent campaigns. Companies with diverse
leadership are 25% more likely to outperform peers, yet many women
still face personal, financial, and cultural hurdles that limit access
and retention. Real change requires equity-focused policies,
mentorship, and a redefinition of what leadership looks like.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 APPLE OPENED THE DOOR TO WEB PAYWALL–OUR TEST SHOWS IT MIGHT HURT
CONVERSIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 RevenueCat tested in-app purchases against web purchases after Apple
allowed developers to bypass the App Store fee. In a four-way
experiment with 5.6K new U.S. users of Dipsea, a subscription-based
audio storytelling app for intimacy and wellness, the in-app only
variant saw a 42% higher initial conversion and trial start rate than
the web-only version, even with a 30% web discount. Most drop-off
happened at the payment step, showing that sending users out of the
app significantly reduces conversions. While web payments may offer
longer-term advantages like faster payouts, early data suggests they
come with a steep short-term cost. 

 STANDING OUT IN THE SCROLL: WHY CONTENT DIFFERENTIATION BEATS
IMITATION ON X (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Firms that created more distinct content from their competitors on X
saw better results in engagement and audience expansion. A study
categorized brand activity into three tiers, starting with basic
promotional updates, followed by community-focused content, and
finally, co-creation strategies that invited user input. Only a
minority of brands operated in the last and most distinct tier, but
those that did captured much more attention and loyalty. 

 HOW TO GET YOUR TEAM TO POST ON LINKEDIN (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Personal LinkedIn accounts reach 10X more people than company pages.
To encourage your team to post, run a friendly internal competition
with rewards. Track metrics like follower growth, engagement,
impressions, and reach. Let the team vote on who created the best
content. Set a shared goal for leads, meetings, or revenue, and make
rewards conditional on the team hitting that goal to keep everyone
accountable.

 ADOBE TO AUTOMATICALLY MOVE SUBSCRIBERS TO PRICIER, AI-FOCUSED TIER
IN JUNE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Adobe will automatically migrate Creative Cloud All Apps subscribers

Creative Cloud Standard plan is available, but it restricts access to
premium AI tools and mobile apps.

 DOES MARKETING STILL BELIEVE IN BRAND GROWTH? (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The last 16 years have seen a disconnect between growing media
investment and stagnant brand growth across industries, from retail to
pharmaceuticals. Advertisers shifted resources to digital platforms
that optimize for short-term engagement and metrics, but this
transition has failed to replace the long-term equity built by
traditional brand campaigns. The result is a growing perception in the
C-suite that marketing's primary role is cost containment rather than
strategic, but intangible value creation.
