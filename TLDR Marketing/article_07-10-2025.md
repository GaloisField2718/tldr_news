NEWS & TRENDS

 FEWER ONLINE ADS ARE GOOD FOR EVERYONE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Reducing online ads boosts reader trust, satisfaction, and brand
favorability. In low-ad environments, 73% of readers trusted
publishers versus 56% in high-ad ones, and 63% felt more favorable
toward brands. Over half showed facial confusion in high-ad settings,
signaling frustration. Fewer intrusive ads improve user experience and
long-term value, even with lower short-term revenue.

 LINKEDIN'S EGC AD STRATEGY (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Employee-generated content is created by staff rather than the
company itself. LinkedIn has been sponsoring employee posts, not just
company page content, to increase ROI. This post shares 3 examples of
LinkedIn staff doing this, including the Head of APAC posting
thought-leadership content, product marketers using creator-style
content to discuss the power of LinkedIn videos, and content
strategists pushing LinkedIn Ads. 

 PERSONALIZED SUBSCRIBER OUTREACH (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Identify your most engaged email subscribers who consistently open
and click your emails, then research who they are from their email
addresses. Send a personalized email to learn about their needs and
interests, aiming to build a closer relationship. Even without a
response, this outreach shows care and strengthens trust.

effectively.

 MICRO-MOMENTS OF MISTRUST: THE EREWHON EDIT (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Even the most curated brands can lose control of the conversation
with a single overlooked word. Erewhon sparked online confusion when
an IG post initially suggested new city openings, then quietly changed
to say the brand was shipping instead. The small edit created a
micro-moment of mistrust, showing how quickly narratives can shift.
