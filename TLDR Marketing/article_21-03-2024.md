READ) [8]

 COPYWRITING STRATEGIES FOR OVERCOMING OBJECTIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It‚Äôs common for companies to not address any objections on their
websites, but this often leads to lost conversions. Address common
objections by simply stating counter-objections, for example, ‚Äúno
rote memorization‚Äù targets online course buyers who don‚Äôt want the
feeling of being back in school. For objections that are strong but
embarrassing objections, frame the counter-objection in a different
way, for example, ‚Äúlet the audio do the work for you‚Äù addresses
buyers who feel too lazy to do the work. Some objections are so taken
for granted that they‚Äôve become assumptions. It‚Äôs best to address
them directly.

 EXPECTANCY THEORY: WHY OUR MOTIVATION IS DRIVEN BY DESIRED REWARDS
AND OUR LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING THEM (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Expectancy Theory is a psychological concept that can help marketers
motivate potential buyers. Psychologists have found that motivation is
influenced by 3 factors: the expectation that the goal can be
achieved, the belief that achieving the goal will lead to a reward,
and the value of the reward to the individual. Airbnb breaks through
fears about renting your home to strangers by showing you what you can
achieve with the extra income. Starbucks uses gamification tactics in
its rewards program to reinforce continued purchases. UNIGNORABLE uses
customer success stories to show prospective students the real impact
