NEWS & TRENDS

 AI THREATENS ENTRY-LEVEL MARKETING JOBS—AND THE FUTURE TALENT
PIPELINE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Entry-level marketing roles are declining as AI takes over repetitive
tasks. Unemployment for recent college graduates is 5.8%, matching
adults without a high school diploma, while underemployment is above
41%. Without these entry-level opportunities, companies could struggle
to develop mid- and senior-level talent in the coming years. 

 FEWER DEALS, BIGGER BILLS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 40% of shoppers expect fewer discounts, and 75% anticipate higher
costs for gifts this holiday season. Concerns about tariffs, supply
chain disruptions, and a potential recession are prompting nearly a
third of shoppers to start gift-buying earlier. Price increases are
expected across categories, including a 15-20% rise in toys sourced
from China. Extended return policies remain a key incentive, while
about a quarter of consumers plan to spend less due to economic
uncertainty. 

 IN COURT FILING, GOOGLE CONCEDES THE OPEN WEB IS IN “RAPID
DECLINE” (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google claims the open web is in “rapid decline” in a court
filing defending its ad business. It argues that forcing a breakup of
AdX would damage a fragile ad-supported ecosystem. While Google
maintains that AI search isn't hurting web traffic, it hasn't provided
data to prove it. Instead, Google's ad revenue is increasingly driven
by mobile apps and walled environments, not open websites.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CLICKUP'S SLIDING INTO DMS OF THEIR UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS (1 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 ClickUp's early growth strategy relied on a scrappy, low-cost tactic
that involved tracking 1-star reviews of competitors on sites like
Capterra, G2, and TrustPilot and then reaching out to frustrated users
directly on LinkedIn. The personalized message framed ClickUp as a
solution to the problems they faced with rival products. This approach
cost nothing but time, generated the company's first 100+ customers,
and helped drive $1M in ARR. 

 PINTEREST SHARES TIPS FOR HOLIDAY CAMPAIGN PLANNING (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Holiday campaign planning on Pinterest should start now to capture
rising gift-related searches that begin in October and peak by
December. With 55% of users preferring personalized recommendations
and saves strongly tied to purchase intent, brands should create
curated festive boards by recipient or interest and prompt users to
save Pins. Pinterest recommends early activation, save-driven design,
and personalized content to influence gift planning behavior and drive
seasonal sales.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 AI & SOCIAL MEDIA (WEBINAR) [12] 

 This webinar on September 10 will address how social teams balance
efficiency and authenticity when using AI. The speakers will explore
ways to humanize brand voice, integrate AI into workflows without
losing identity, and create brand-first content. The discussion will
also cover practical applications and distinguish hype from helpful
tools. 

 WHAT IS EMOTIONAL MARKETING? HOW TO MAKE RESONANT ADS (6 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 70% of consumer purchase decisions are driven by emotion rather than
rational factors. Customers with strong emotional engagement are more
loyal and are more willing to spend more, recommend a brand, and
promote it on social media. Ads that spark strong emotional responses
are 2.6X more likely to go viral and 4X more likely to build long-term
brand value. This guide covers how common emotional triggers like
nostalgia, FOMO, individuality, and well-being can be leveraged to
drive deeper connections.

 THE EMPEROR HAS NO CODE: AI STARTUPS LIKE CLUELY AND SERIES ARE
MAKING A BIG BET ON MARKETING, GEN Z–STYLE (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Cluely built its reputation on viral stunts and creator-driven
marketing. Its CMO, Daniel Min, has centered the company's growth on
social media, relying on provocative videos, UGC, and local creators.
Critics say Cluely's AI is either a cheating tool or just a “GPT
wrapper”, but its ability to spark conversation keeps it relevant
and reflects a shift where young founders act as influencers instead
of engineers. 

 WHY I DELETE HALF MY LINKEDIN POSTS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Social platforms present audience growth as empowerment but profit
from free user labor, data, and content. Algorithms push creators to
self-censor, simplify ideas, and chase scale. This leads to conformity
instead of authentic expression. Real connection may come from
smaller, intentional communities outside platform control, where
resonance matters more than reach.
