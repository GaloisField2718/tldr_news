 REDDIT DEAL TO ALLOW 'LARGE AI COMPANY' TO TRAIN ITS MODEL ON USER
CONTENT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Reddit struck a $60M deal with an undisclosed AI company to use its
user content for training models. While this monetization of user data
may benefit the company financially, it‚Äôs unlikely to be welcomed by
users. The deal reflects a trend where companies are eager to use
platforms with valuable UGC to train AI models. This raises concerns
about privacy and user consent.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE HARD THING(S) ABOUT POSITIONING AND MESSAGING (5 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Businesses often fail because they lack foundational messaging,
don‚Äôt conduct market research, or only describe their products for
non-customer audiences. To resolve this, brands should be clear about
marketing terms, including vision, mission, and positioning statement.
Use a positioning template that outlines exactly what the product is
and who it‚Äôs for. Tailor messaging for the customer, ensuring it is
in terms they understand and care about. 

 HOW TO MAXIMIZE SPONSORSHIP REVENUE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Two monetization alternatives for media businesses are programmatic
ads and custom sponsorships. Most media businesses such as blogs,
newsletters, and podcasts have a mix of revenue streams, but
sponsorships tend to be overlooked since they are harder to establish.
While programmatic ads offer low sales effort and may suit some
publications, they can lead to a race for scale and lower production
costs. On the other hand, custom sponsorships require more effort but
can be more lucrative, particularly for publications with a niche
focus and strong audience relationships. 

 BUILDING YOUR BRAND THROUGH CUSTOMER CARE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Customer care is not just another department's responsibility. It is
a critical component of brand image and customer sentiment,
particularly as social media becomes a preferred platform for support.
Collaboration between marketing and customer service teams is
essential for delivering best-in-class service and retaining
customers.
