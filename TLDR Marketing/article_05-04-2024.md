STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 3 WAYS TO ADD HUMOR INTO YOUR MARKETING COPY (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Most marketing today works by grabbing attention, making you
emotional, and turning emotion into action. For this to work, your
audience has to trust, like, and relate to you ‚Äì which is where
humor comes into play. One tactic is to make fun of yourself, as IKEA
did with a playfully misassembled ad. You can also make extreme and
humorous analogies to show how your customer‚Äôs life would look
without your product. Alternatively, brands can take a bold stance
against something in their industry they don‚Äôt agree with, as
Verizon did with its ‚Äúone size does not fit all‚Äù messaging. 

 AN A/B TEST FOR CHECKOUT ABANDONMENT (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This post breaks down an example of a checkout abandonment A/B test
that tested a delay of 1 hour vs. 2-3 hours when sending the first
follow-up email. Brands will often focus on one metric, which is the
number of placed orders for the first email. The 1 hour test version
will always win ‚Äî but the truth is this doesn‚Äôt paint the full
picture of what‚Äôs happening. A proper test would split the following
into 2 cohorts, tag 50% of the profiles as 'control' and the other
half as 'test', and capture the flow start date. Segments to pull
include the number of people in each cohort in the last month,
discounts used by cohort, placed orders by cohort, and unsubscribed by
cohort.
