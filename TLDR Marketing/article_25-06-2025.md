 HOW AI IS RE-HUMANIZING SHOPPING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Buyers crave simpler shopping experiences and are tired of hitting
digital dead ends. A new report by Bloomreach [4] reveals that:

 	* 97% of shoppers who have used an AI shopping assistant find it
helpful.
 	* Over 46% believe that an AI assistant would offer more honest
advice about an outfit than a friend.
 	* Conversational shopping increases revenue per visit by 33% on
average.

Learn how conversational AI is teaching people to shop like humans
again — and what that means for your brand.

NEWS & TRENDS

 AI VISITORS VISIT FEWER PAGES AND BOUNCE MORE OFTEN THAN TRADITIONAL
SEARCH VISITORS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI visitors view 1.2 fewer pages than search users and bounce at a
rate 4.1% higher. Despite spending slightly more time on site, their
sessions are narrower in depth, indicating more focused intent or
faster drop-off. These patterns suggest AI users often arrive with
specific goals or expectations that websites may not yet be optimized
to meet. 

 FREE RETURNS ARE OFTEN A DEAL BREAKER FOR CONSUMERS (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Nearly 9 in 10 consumers expect free returns, and 47% have stopped
shopping at a retailer due to an unfavorable return policy. Return
experiences now shape purchase decisions, especially in fashion where
over two-thirds of consumers returned clothing or footwear last year.
Retailers face rising return costs, totaling $890 billion in 2024,
driven by poor fit and consumer mistrust in product descriptions.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW SUPERPOWER BUILT A 150K WAITLIST (IN 6 MONTHS) (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Superpower built a 150,000-person waitlist in six months by
prioritizing distribution before product. It used a strong brand
foundation, viral referral mechanics, and shareable user-generated
content like digital health cards to drive organic growth. Strategic
acquisitions and creative product drops fueled PR and attention, while
creators and employees became embedded brand advocates. One tweet
drove 7,000 signups, and organic content consistently reached hundreds
of thousands. 

 INSIDE SHARKNINJA'S “SOCIAL-FIRST” MARKETING STRATEGY (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 SharkNinja grew net sales by 14.7% in Q1 by using a social-first
strategy that combines influencer partnerships, social listening, and
agile content creation. The brand's TurboBlade fan, featured in a
lo-fi TikTok clip with over 32 million views, reflects its focus on
consumer relatability over polish. Led by a dedicated in-house
creative team and weekly “Obsessed with Winning” reviews, the
company rapidly iterates on social feedback, turning viral interest
into product enhancements like the Ninja Swirl. Influencers not only
promote but also shape product direction, with early seeding and
summits used to refine names, features, and launch plans. 

 HOW TO COLLECT CUSTOMER SUCCESS STORIES WITH 1 EMAIL (1 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 This tactic used a simple email to gather 24 customer stories without
offering any incentives. Framed as a request to spotlight user wins,
not collect content, it came from a well-known in-house expert with
the subject line “Small favor”. The tone was conversational, and
the typeform felt more like a dialogue than a form. This approach
filled a refreshed story hub, generated weeks of social content, and
even sparked a creative campaign. People are eager to help when they
feel recognized.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 CHATGPT PROMPT TO OPTIMIZE YOUR SITE FOR AEO (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Fewer than 7% of websites are optimized to appear in ChatGPT and
other AI search results, creating a huge opportunity for those who act
quickly. This post includes a templated prompt that reviews content to
identify missing elements like headings, FAQs, schema, tone, and
internal links to make pages AI-answer-ready. 

 SURFER (TOOL) [11] 

 Surfer analyzes top-performing pages and provides recommendations for
keyword usage, structure, and internal links. Its features include an
AI writing assistant, Auto-Optimize tools, and real-time SEO
suggestions. The platform also offers a Content Audit tool that
identifies the best opportunities within existing content, monitors
ranking performance, and delivers weekly updates for quick SEO wins.
Surfer's AI Tracker adds visibility into how content performs in
AI-driven search and LLM platforms.

 1,001 SELLS MORE THAN 1,000 (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Marketers can increase consumer interest by using numbers that
slightly exceed familiar boundaries. Across nine experiments with
2,081 participants, people were willing to pay 219.5% more for a watch
limited to 1,001 units versus 1,000, and a book titled "1,001 Places"
saw 33% more selections than "1,000 Places." The effect draws
attention and increases desire but weakens with larger deviations or
when paired with other persuasive tactics. It does not work for
pricing or when used in combination with tactics like social proof. 

 HOW TO CUT THROUGH IN A SOCIAL-FIRST WORLD (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Brands need to leverage culture and trends to produce timely content
to stand out on social. They must also adapt above-the-line campaigns
such as TV and out-of-home ads to match social platforms' native
formats. Seamlessly integrating brand elements into engaging content
without interrupting the user experience is crucial. Collaborating
with creators who offer authentic storytelling and genuine social
proof, rather than relying on traditional influencers, helps create a
stronger impact.
