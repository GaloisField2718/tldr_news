 WANT TO WIN IN AI SEARCH? START BY FIGURING OUT WHERE ANSWERS COME
FROM (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Pretty much every marketing team on Earth is thinking about ways to
improve brand visibility in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and co.

One approach: try to generate a ton of content and hope that it gets
picked up. A smarter starting point: find the information sources that
models are using today.

This Peec AI guide [5] will help you:

 	* Uncover which sources AI models use to answer questions you care
about
 	* Identify gaps, competitor wins, and opportunities
 	* Act quickly to boost your presence (e.g. join Reddit
conversations, pitch a guest article)

NEWS & TRENDS

 FROM ADS TO EPISODES: WHY BRANDS ARE BETTING ON CREATOR‑LED SHOWS
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Social-first content is evolving into serialized entertainment, with
brands now commissioning full creator-led shows rather than one-off
posts. Creator content performs 3-5X better than traditional branded
assets when scaled across channels. 63% of 18-34 year-olds stream
daily via connected TVs. Brands should act like producers, building
operational systems to manage IP, streamline approvals, and repurpose
content across platforms. 

 AMAZON REMOVES ALL GOOGLE SHOPPING ADS GLOBALLY IN 48 HOURS (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Amazon pulled its ads from Google Shopping across all major markets
between July 21 and 23. This included the US, UK, Germany, and Japan,
dropping its impression share from up to 60% to zero. This move
follows months of reduced ad spend and appears to be a strategic shift
aimed at cutting costs, testing paid search value, and asserting
greater control over traffic as AI-driven shopping tools gain
traction. The withdrawal marks Amazon's most significant advertising
exit since its 2020 pullback.

 7 WAYS TO GET BETTER RESULTS FROM AI IMAGE GENERATORS (9 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Start by brainstorming ideas and using AI image generators like a
sketchbook to explore concepts. Leverage style codes for consistency,
prompt AI to help write prompts, and try multiple platforms to find
what works best. Focus on signal strength and clarity, not perfection.
Use AI to refine your creative process and build reusable workflows
with tools like Gemini's Custom Gems for more consistent image
generation over time. 

 STEAL THIS UPGRADE EMAIL FROM CALENDLY (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Calendly's upgrade email is effective because it spells out the value
of paid features. It recommends a specific plan based on user
behavior, reducing decision fatigue. It also taps into loss aversion
by letting users try premium tools during a free trial. This makes the
upgrade feel hard to give up, especially after getting used to the
perks.

 GOOGLE'S INDEX NOW POWERS CHATGPT (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ChatGPT appears to use Google's index and cache to retrieve web
content, based on tests showing it returns information only from pages
submitted to Google. Visibility in ChatGPT depends largely on whether
a page is indexed. Issues like “crawled but not indexed” are
common and not always critical, but improving internal linking and
creating unique content can help important pages get indexed. For
better AI visibility, structure content clearly, answer questions
directly, use Schema.org markup, and ensure pages work without
JavaScript. 

 INTRODUCING THE GOOGLE TRENDS API (ALPHA): A NEW WAY TO ACCESS SEARCH
TRENDS DATA (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google launched an alpha version of the Google Trends API. It allows
a limited number of developers to access search trends data
programmatically. The API provides consistently scaled search interest
data over the past 1,800 days, with daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly
aggregations. It supports geographic filtering by region and
subregion. The API improves on the website version by allowing
comparisons across multiple terms and timeframes without re-scaling
each request.

 HOW MCDONALD'S DUG INTO NOSTALGIA AND REIGNITED THE CHICKEN WARS (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 McDonald's revived its cult-favorite Snack Wrap in July, boosting
foot traffic and triggering fresh competition in the chicken category.
Popeyes responded with new Chicken Wraps and an AI-generated diss
track, while Taco Bell, KFC, Wingstop, and White Castle launched or
marketed new chicken items. Chicken remains a key innovation driver in
the quick service restaurant space, with brands leaning into
nostalgia, cultural campaigns, celebrity tie-ins, and loyalty plays to
win market share. 

 HOW HIGH-PERFORMING GTM TEAMS TURN BUYER SIGNALS INTO REVENUE-DRIVING
ACTION (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GTM teams now use intent data to drive pipeline and speed up sales by
focusing on signal strength, not lead volume. Effective programs treat
intent as a layer that improves existing channels and combine first-,
second-, and third-party data for broader insight. AI now helps teams
score signals, predict buyer readiness, and automate follow-up, making
intent data more actionable across the entire customer lifecycle.
