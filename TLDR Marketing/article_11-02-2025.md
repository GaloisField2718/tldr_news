 HOW TO DEAL WITH TOUGH CUSTOMER CALLS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 To handle tough customer interviews, embrace silence to encourage
elaboration. Use "how" instead of "why" to prompt more honest,
detailed responses. If an answer feels vague, express your confusion
to encourage clarification. Reframe questions to make them easier to
answer and help the customer feel comfortable. Trust your preparation
- discomfort can lead to deeper insights and more valuable takeaways.

 MARKETERS HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL BUT THEY ARE NOT BEING SUPPORTED
ENOUGH (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Over half of marketing professionals feel overwhelmed and
undervalued, with nearly half of teams facing annual restructures
driven by cost-cutting rather than strategy. As marketing is
increasingly viewed as a discretionary expense, teams are pressured to
do more with less. While automation and AI can boost efficiency,
without clear strategic direction and leadership support, many will
remain in a reactive, high-stress environment. 

 HOW TO USE DATA MORE STRATEGICALLY TO REACH AUDIENCES (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Using audience insights to focus marketing on niche communities can
be more effective than relying solely on Google, Meta, or LinkedIn
ads. Identifying where audiences spend time enables more strategic
outreach, as seen with podcasters and event organizers leveraging
influencer networks over broad paid ads. Zero-click marketing, like
Chartr's Reddit engagement, builds trust without requiring direct
clicks. Balancing data with qualitative research and exploring
underutilized channels can help maximize impact. 

 STEAM'S OVERLORDS STILL THINK IN-GAME ADS ARE FINE AS LONG AS THEY'RE
"APPROPRIATE" (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Valve updated its Steamworks policy to clarify that in-game ads are
allowed if they fit the game's context but banned business models
relying on paid advertising. Developers must remove forced ad-watching
mechanics before selling on Steam and are encouraged to use
single-purchase or microtransaction-based models instead. The policy
permits real-world brands in games if they enhance immersion and have
the necessary licenses, but prohibits rewarding players for engaging
with ads. Past controversies, such as unskippable ads in NBA 2K21,
show the challenges of balancing advertising and player experience.
