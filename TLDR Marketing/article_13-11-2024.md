 META TO OFFER FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM USERS IN EUROPE LESS
PERSONALIZED ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta will stop using historical data for ad targeting in Europe,
narrowing personalization to recent session information and basic
demographics. In response to EU regulations, Meta now provides a
non-subscription option for less personalized ads on Facebook and
Instagram. These adjustments, aimed at increasing user control over
data, signal Meta's willingness to adapt to Europe's privacy
landscape.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PROMOTIONS IN ITALICS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Using italic fonts in promotional ads can significantly boost
consumer engagement. Research has found that slanted italics increase
purchase intentions by creating a sense of urgency, as people perceive
the promotion as shorter-lived. In one study, 3 times more people
clicked on an email link for a Starbucks deal when the text was
italicized. Similarly, consumers were 30.7% more likely to buy from a
restaurant promotion in italics. The effect is maximized when the
slant is sharper (up to 35°) than standard italics, but it fades if
the text doesn't promote a specific deal or if the slant is leftward. 

 HOW TO ALIGN YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY WITH BUSINESS GOALS (1 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Align your social strategy with business objectives by focusing on
increasing awareness, acquiring customers, and deepening engagement.
Boost impressions using zero-click content, blog summaries, and
repurposed posts that provide standalone value. Address pain points by
solving customers' problems through educational content that guides
them to your solution. Show product utility through demos, exclusive
offers, and complementary product promotions. Experiment by commenting
on similar accounts, adjusting hooks and posting times, and building
series from high-engagement content to refine your approach. 

 5 SCRAPPY WAYS TO GET INSIGHTS (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Use tools like Gong for QBR recordings and AI summaries to identify
issues and customer pain points. Export won opportunities and apply
simple formulas for quick insights on sales cycle data. Platforms like
Wynter provide feedback within days for enterprise buyer research.
Campaign and event impacts can be assessed by cross-referencing
participant and opportunity data with AI. While these methods aren't
perfect or scalable, they're better than nothing.

 HOW HUY FONG'S SRIRACHA WENT FROM HOT TO NOT (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Huy Fong's rise to prominence was fueled by its iconic branding, but
the decision to allow imitators to use similar bottle designs led to a
diluted brand identity in a competitive market. When Huy Fong faced
production halts due to supply issues, McIlhenny, the maker of
Tabasco, seized the opportunity by positioning its own sriracha under
the trusted Tabasco name, offering consumers a known brand in the wake
of Huy Fong's shortage. McIlhenny differentiated itself while meeting
demand by using Tabasco's strong legacy and protected branding. 

 WHY YOUR PRODUCT IDEA SOUNDS TOO COMPLICATED (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The "Simple to WTF" scale illustrates how product descriptions can
range from clear and concise to overly complex and confusing. The
simplest descriptions use familiar adjective-noun combinations (e.g.
"electric car"), while more complex ones involve niche comparisons
(e.g. "X for Y") that can be harder to grasp. Overly detailed or
abstract explanations often confuse audiences. Simplifying
descriptions by using customer feedback and positioning against
familiar categories helps make products more relatable and memorable.
