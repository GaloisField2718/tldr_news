NEWS & TRENDS

 TIKTOK AND THE US FINALLY REACH A DEAL, BUT HAS THE DAMAGE ALREADY
BEEN DONE FOR CREATORS? (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TikTok now appears stable in the US after a binding deal that ends
the threat of a ban. The agreement lets it keep operating for 170M US
users and sets up a structure where ByteDance holds a 19.9% stake
while US and global investors control the rest. This creates more
certainty for brands and creators, but many creators have already
faced lost income and anxiety about algorithm changes during the past
year. 

 WHY GOOGLE IS DELETING REVIEWS AT RECORD LEVELS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has been removing reviews at unprecedented rates due to
automated moderation, incentivized review enforcement, and local
regulations. The deletions have affected both negative and positive
reviews, with patterns varying by industry, geography, and review age.
Restaurants and retail have seen retroactive removals, while medical
and home services experienced early deletions, often targeting
five-star reviews. English-speaking markets rely on AI-driven
enforcement, while Germany emphasizes legal takedowns. These trends
risk eroding trust and distorting data, making review monitoring
essential for local SEO.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 46 META STUDIES, 225 CAMPAIGNS: WHICH OBJECTIVES AND CREATIVES DRIVE
RESULTS? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Demand generation on Meta works best when campaign objectives,
creative types, and frequency are chosen to match brand goals and
audience awareness. Reach objectives hit lower awareness audiences,
while Ad Recall and Thruplay reach users who already know the brand,
and Traffic goals can lift purchase intent to 8% compared to a 4.2%
average. High-fidelity brand and product creatives drive the biggest
awareness lifts at about 8% and 7.5%, while low-fidelity native
content is strongest for intent at about 6%. Memory improves most when
people see about two ads every seven days, which helps recall and
supports long-term brand growth. 

 HOW TO DO A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPETITOR ANALYSIS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Start by identifying 3-7 relevant competitors and reviewing their
platforms, profiles, posting frequency, branding, and tone. Study
10-20 recent posts, track content mixes such as 50% Stories and 25%
Reels, and assess engagement, such as cases where 45K followers get
only 30-40 likes. This process reveals strengths, weaknesses, and
gaps. A free Google Sheet analysis template is available.

 WHEN IT COMES TO ADVERTISING, FUNNY MATTERS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In a world full of gloom, comedy in advertising stands out. From
Peter Kay's sketches to campaigns like Tango, Supernoodle, and Old
Spice, they become part of culture, remembered long after they aired.
Humour connects emotionally and makes messages stick. Advertising
should reclaim its funnybone, using humour to entertain and shape
culture. 

 INSIDE THE DECISION TO REBRAND GRAMMARLY AS SUPERHUMAN (9 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Grammarly has rebranded as Superhuman following the acquisition of
Superhuman Mail and the launch of Superhuman Go. This rebrand signals
an evolution from a writing tool into an AI-native productivity suite.
The new brand architecture supports future growth and positions AI as
an accessible productivity partner. Central to the new identity is
“Hero”, a logo-character that operates both as a visual asset and
functional guide within the product. Developed for flexibility, the
visual system emphasizes human-AI partnership, with motion, color, and
tone. 

 HERE'S WHY GOOGLE ADS FAIL QUIETLY (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google Ads performance often fails quietly due to over-segmentation.
Campaigns are frequently split by product, audience, or device,
leading to thin budgets and low conversion volume. This limits smart
bidding's ability to optimize effectively. A consistent trend across
over 130 accounts shows that fragmented structures create fragmented
results. Consolidation based on actual spend and intent improves
learning and performance.
