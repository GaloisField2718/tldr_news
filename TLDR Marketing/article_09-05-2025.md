NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE BUSINESS SUMMIT REVIEW: AI & SEO SHIFTS (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The 2025 Google Business Summit revealed how Google is prioritizing
helpful, reader-focused content over keyword-heavy posts. It's
confirmed that recent algorithm changes have unintentionally favored
larger sites, though efforts to fix this are underway. Creators are
encouraged to diversify traffic sources beyond Google by using
platforms like Pinterest, YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and email. Video and
personal connection now impact search visibility, as social content
increasingly appears in search results. SEO now centers on user
satisfaction, clarity, and trust signals rather than length or
backlinks. Google has urged creators to stop writing for algorithms
and focus on truly meeting user intent.

into employee onboarding, test variety packs as discovery tools, and
generate inbound interest from bodegas driven by “as seen on
TikTok” signs and word-of-mouth momentum. 

 3 OUT-OF-THE-BOX PPC TARGETING STRATEGIES THAT HELP YOU DRIVE BETTER

competitor replacement. These tactics are illustrated with examples
like noise-canceling headphones for “travel essentials” and social
media platforms replacing virtual assistants. To implement these
strategies effectively, marketers will need matching audience
segments, custom landing pages, and ongoing A/B testing to refine
performance. 

 THE LINKEDIN PLAYBOOK EVERY B2B MARKETER SHOULD STEAL (7 MINUTE READ)

posts, aim to post 3-7 times a week, and engage with others daily.
Track meaningful signals like inbound leads, recognition at events,
and comments from prospects to measure success. If posting for a
teammate, use interviews to capture tone and build internal excitement
by sharing wins.

 HOW TRUST BANK WENT FROM ZERO TO A MILLION CUSTOMERS IN LESS THAN
THREE YEARS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Trust Bank, a digital-only bank in Singapore, reached one million
customers despite operating in a highly banked market where 98% of
adults already have accounts. It achieved rapid growth through a mix
of fast onboarding, instant rewards, and partnerships with FairPrice,
which helped it attract a broad customer base. About 70% of its
customer base came through a referral program that provided immediate
incentives, keeping acquisition costs to around one-seventh of the
industry norm. Trust focused on authentic influencer partnerships and
unique campaigns like a live cash grab event to build brand visibility
and loyalty. It continues to use data and AI to drive personalisation
and aims to grow by deepening emotional connections with its users. 

 YOUR META ADS A/B TESTS ARE MISLEADING (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A/B tests on Meta often give misleading results because its algorithm
shows different ad versions to different audiences, such as skewing
based on gender. In one study, audience gender mix varied by up to
57%, which biased outcomes when audience response differed by gender.
These tests are only reliable for optimizing campaigns within Meta,
not for broader marketing decisions or other platforms. To validate
strategy or messaging, marketers should use different methods like
surveys or run separate tests on each platform. 

 WHY RETAINING MORE CUSTOMERS MIGHT BE HURTING YOUR GROWTH (5 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 In a recent ecommerce study, brands with higher retention but
declining spend per customer saw revenue drops, while those with lower
retention but increased spend among retained customers experienced up
to 130 percent growth. The strongest performance came from brands that
focused on building emotional connection through customer service,
which was found to be the top driver of increased spend, outperforming
loyalty programs and advertising in long-term impact.
