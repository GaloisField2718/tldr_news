NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA ALGORITHMS CHANGED THE WAY WE INTERACT? (7
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Social media algorithms shape how speech is shared by amplifying or
suppressing content, often prioritizing controversial posts that drive
engagement. This algorithmic control distorts public discourse, making
visibility dependent on platform mechanics rather than the value of
ideas. As a result, social media is no longer a level playing field,
as algorithms significantly influence what is heard and the nature of
free speech online. 

 THE INFLUENCER SIZE THAT DELIVERS BEST ROI (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Micro-influencers with up to 50K followers deliver the best ROI for
brands. Smaller influencers, especially those with fewer than 10K
followers, post sponsored content 67% more frequently than influencers
with over 1M followers. Brands with limited budgets find
micro-influencers attractive due to their authentic engagement and
closer relationships with followers. Compensation varies widely, with
Instagram influencers charging between $10 and $10K per post, while
TikTok rates range from $25 to $2.5K.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO PRICE YOUR PRODUCT: MISTAKES YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 When pricing your product, focus on the value you offer rather than
relying on formulas. Many companies guess their prices, with 85%
lacking a strategic approach. Value-based pricing aligns your price
with the economic benefits delivered, such as time savings or cost
reductions. Avoid pricing too low, as it can hurt brand perception and
profitability. Cost-plus or competitor-based pricing can work but may
miss capturing your product's full value. Strategies like price tiers,
skimming, and penetration pricing can attract different customer
segments. 

 UNLOCK REVENUE GROWTH WITH ZERO-PARTY DATA (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post critiques the common claim that email marketing can deliver
a 30% revenue increase through tactics like pop-ups and frequent
campaigns. It stresses the importance of leveraging zero-party data.
Instead of merely collecting contact details, brands should ask
targeted questions about customers' goals and what matters most to
them. This approach leads to increased revenue, higher conversion
rates, improved welcome flows, and a more qualified email list,
allowing brands to uncover valuable insights that many overlook.

 WHERE TO PUT YOUR LOGO (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Traditional logo placements, such as billboards, often miss
opportunities to tell a brand's story in a more interesting and subtle
way. Bitdefender and CrowdStrike, for instance, placed their logos on
Formula 1 car halos to symbolize protection, while Brex sponsored
hotel key cards at SXSW to stay top of mind with attendees. Other
creative logo placement ideas include public restroom mirrors, coat
check tickets, escape room clues, and ice sculptures. 

 WILL AI AGENTS KILL ADVERTISEMENTS? YES, YES, NO, AND YES (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 AI agents will transform the internet by handling tasks for users and
filtering out ads. Premium AI agents will eliminate ads entirely,
while freemium models will include more personalized advertisements.
Advertisers will need to shift from traditional ads to offering
discounts and special deals tailored to consumer needs. Marketers will
focus on creating engaging online experiences as AI agents become the
main users of websites. 

 MIRO'S PRICING PAGE EVOLUTION (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Miro has repeatedly updated its pricing page over the past 18 months,
refining positioning and user alignment without changing prices. Key
adjustments included tailoring plan descriptions to user profiles,
testing call-to-actions like "Buy Business" over "Try it Free," and
reintroducing free trials to gauge engagement. Miro also experimented
with linking plan descriptions to track user interest and buying
intent.
