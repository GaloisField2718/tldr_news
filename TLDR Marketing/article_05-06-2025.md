NEWS & TRENDS

 STATE OF SEARCH Q1 2025: BEHAVIORS, TRENDS, AND CLICKS ACROSS THE US
& EUROPE (13 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 While traditional engines still lead, with a 90.2% user share in the
US and 92.5% in Europe, AI search is steadily gaining ground. ChatGPT
reached 21.7% of the user base in the US and 26.6% in Europe, where
adoption has outpaced the US. Users are not just searching, but
completing tasks, with AI traffic increasingly directed to platforms
like YouTube, GitHub, and ResearchGate. Organic clicks remain the top
search outcome, while zero-click results saw a small uptick. YouTube
rose to the top destination from traditional search in the US,
reflecting the rise of video-based discovery. AI adoption is growing
but follows a familiar slow-burn curve, not a sudden disruption. 

 DO US CONSUMERS CARE ABOUT SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING IN 2025? (11 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 77% of US consumers say recyclability is the most important
sustainability feature in packaging, yet only a third rank
environmental impact among their top purchasing concerns. Functional
benefits like shelf life, label clarity, and durability dominate
decision-making, especially amid inflation and economic uncertainty.
While many still care about sustainability, they expect brand owners
to lead the effort without requiring trade-offs in price or
performance.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE MOST EFFECTIVE CREATOR MARKETING GOES BEYOND ENDORSEMENTS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 About half of Gen Z feels a stronger connection to creators than to
celebrities. This emotional tie is shaping how brands approach
partnerships by bringing creators into the early stages of campaign
development instead of treating them as distribution channels. Brands
are now involving creators in ideation and production to build
campaigns that reflect the creator's voice and audience expectations.
The approach reflects a broader understanding that authenticity and
personal connection are driving purchase behavior more than celebrity
status. 

 HOW TO DO GEO FOR LINKEDIN AND REDDIT CONTENT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LLMs often source content from Reddit and LinkedIn when making
recommendations, even though social content may not directly drive
clicks. To optimize for this, create clear, easy-to-read lists or
reviews that answer common questions, use AI tools to polish posts for
clarity, and encourage customers or partners to mention your brand
frequently. Engaging content that generates many comments, especially
through open-ended questions or slight controversy, increases the
chance of being cited. Comment volume, rather than likes or
impressions, strongly influences inclusion in these AI-driven
recommendations.

 HOW 3 MARKETERS USE AI (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 3 marketers share how they use AI to simplify and speed up content,
outreach, and sales. They repurpose past content to generate
founder-style posts using tools like Claude and Descript, automate
podcast and PR outreach through AI protocols, and deploy AI agents to
qualify leads, follow up with churned customers, schedule meetings,
and handle multilingual calls.

 CHATGPT VS CLAUDE VS GEMINI: THE BEST AI MODEL FOR EACH USE CASE IN
2025 (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Claude stood out with its high-fidelity execution, especially in
complex coding tasks like building a Mario-level game and in writing
edits that retained the author's tone with minimal prompting. ChatGPT
excelled in personalized assistance, using memory to recall user
context, respond with emotional nuance, and produce structured,
actionable research. Gemini led in multimodal experimentation,
particularly in video generation with Veo 3, and delivered fast,
budget-friendly performance for developers working across formats.

 THE PERSONALIZATION OF SOFTWARE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Software has shifted from being personal and expressive, like on
MySpace, to mass-market and uniform, like Facebook. Despite the
explosion of apps, most are built for general use rather than tailored
to individual needs. AI is reversing this trend by making personalized
software fast and accessible. Tools like Lovable enable anyone to
build apps in seconds, with Lovable now reaching $60M in ARR.
Meanwhile, Helium aims to automate software improvement using AI
agents that experiment and optimize continuously, boosting outcomes
like paywall revenue by over 50%. As AI spreads, it's enabling
non-coders to create software and letting software improve itself,
reshaping who builds and how. 

 MATCH GROUP CEO SAYS GEN Z IS DIFFERENT AND HE'S MAKING DRASTIC
CHANGES TO TINDER TO KEEP UP (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Tinder and other Match Group apps are losing traction with Gen Z, a
cohort that prefers real-life interactions and feels alienated by
swipe-based dating. CEO Spencer Rascoff is revamping product strategy
to align with these trends, introducing features like collaborative
dating that allow users to pair up with friends and match with other
pairs for group chats and real-life meetups. The broader goal is to
shift the perception of dating apps from transactional experiences to
spaces that connect people and reduce loneliness.
