NEWS & TRENDS

 APPLE, META FINED AS EU PRESSES AHEAD WITH TECH PROBES (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The EU fined Apple €500 million ($570 million) and Meta €200
million for violating the Digital Markets Act, which aims to limit Big
Tech's dominance. Apple was penalized for restricting developers from
offering cheaper deals outside its App Store, while Meta's
"pay-or-consent" ad model was found non-compliant. Both companies plan
to challenge the fines, calling them unfair and harmful to innovation.
The EU's actions come amid political tension with the U.S., as
regulators push forward with enforcement despite threats of
retaliation. 

 OPENAI WANTS TO BUY CHROME AND MAKE IT AN “AI-FIRST” EXPERIENCE
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has expressed interest in acquiring Chrome if regulators force
Google to divest the browser as part of antitrust remedies. With plans
for deeper integration of agentic AI models and product distribution,
owning Chrome would allow OpenAI to embed ChatGPT at scale and collect
user interaction data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR PRODUCT'S BENEFITS MUST SEEM RELATED (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Products with multiple, related benefits sell better than those with
a single benefit or multiple unrelated ones. In a study of 1,059
healthcare products, those with related benefits saw 42% higher sales,
while those with unrelated benefits had 66% fewer orders. Consumers
preferred and recommended items like cold medicine or maternity
services more when their benefits were clearly linked. However, this
effect disappears with low-quality items or when benefits feel
disconnected. 

 UNDENIABLE CONTRAST (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To grab a buyer's attention, use undeniable contrast. Highlight the
shift from old to new, manual to automated, or before vs. after. Make
the pain specific by emphasizing tangible issues like "30 minutes of
manual follow-up." Lead with outcomes, not features. Buyers care about
time saved, not just automation. Display the shift side-by-side to
make the impact instantly clear. This approach conveys the value of
your product in a quick and compelling way. 

 7 CONTENT REPURPOSING TACTICS TO CREATE 40+ PIECES OF CONTENT PER
WEEK (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 By prioritizing idea-first planning and structured repurposing, a
single concept or idea can yield 15 assets including carousels,
infographics, videos, and newsletters. Efficiency comes from reusing
outlines, frequently tracking engagement data to guide topics, and
leveraging one central content piece to power multi-month campaigns.
The model reduces workload, improves message coherence, and drives
monetization through repeatable workflows.

 BRANDS NEED TO RETHINK ENGAGEMENT BEYOND THE FEED (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Declining engagement is often caused by content that fails to spark
reaction rather than algorithm shifts in the platform. Many brands
still focus on visibility instead of interaction, missing the fact
that real engagement happens in comments, DMs, and group chats instead
of the feed. The most valuable signals are relationship-based, not
reach-based, and brands ignoring these interactions are missing the
most insightful audience feedback. 

 CLOSING THE CONTENT GAP: WHAT WE LEARNED FROM TALKING TO 400+ GTM
PROS (20 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 While content marketing is valued, there's a disconnect between
content teams and the broader org. Most GTM teammates want to be
involved in content creation, but only half have had a good experience
doing so. Content marketers feel their work is undervalued, especially
when it comes to long-term impact like brand awareness. Both sides
agree that content is a key revenue driver. Higher quality,
audience-first content and stronger collaboration across teams is
needed to truly close the gap.
