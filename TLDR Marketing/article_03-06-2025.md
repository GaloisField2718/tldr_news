NEWS & TRENDS

 META AIMS TO FULLY AUTOMATE ADVERTISING WITH AI BY 2026 (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Meta plans to automate ad creation and targeting with AI by the end
of 2026. Brands will only need to provide a product image and budget,
and Meta's AI will generate the ad content, suggest spend, and
determine targeting across Facebook and Instagram. The platform will
also offer real-time ad personalization based on factors like
location. 

 BLUESKY HAS CAUGHT ON WITH MANY NEWS INFLUENCERS, BUT X REMAINS
POPULAR (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bluesky saw a sharp rise in adoption by news influencers after the
2024 election. The platform's growth is driven largely by left-leaning
influencers, 69% of whom now have a Bluesky account, compared to just
15% of right-leaning ones. Despite Bluesky's rise, X remains dominant,
with 82% of the influencers still using it and 83% of those posting
there 4 or more days a week. In contrast, only 31% of Bluesky users
posted that often in early 2025, and 48% posted irregularly or not at
all. Most influencers on Bluesky also maintain an X account and few
have left X entirely.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 COPYWRITING: WORKING HARD VS. HARDLY WORKING (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Lead generation should prioritize quality over quantity. For broad
appeal, attract a wide group through multiple channels and incentives,
such as charity runs that engage hundreds of millions of runners
worldwide. For niche segments, use insider language to build a strong
connection with a specific group, like campaigns aimed at dedicated
running enthusiasts. For the most exclusive approach, avoid promotion
altogether to create intrigue and status. 

 CROSS-SELL TACTICS OF TOP DTC BRANDS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Product bundling groups related items at a discount to encourage
larger purchases and reduce decision fatigue. Shopping cart and
checkout suggestions surface add-ons when shoppers are already in
buying mode. Threshold-based incentives, such as free gifts or
shipping when spending reaches a certain amount, drive higher-value
orders.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 INSTAGRAM CREATORS WITH OVER 100K FOLLOWERS WILL GET ACCESS TO
ADDITIONAL COMMENT FILTERS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Instagram is expanding its comment filtering tools to creators with
over 100K followers. These tools let users sort comments by top
engagement, newest first, or commenter follower count. Creators can
also filter to show comments only from people they follow, verified
users, or subscribers. These features help large creators focus on key
interactions and boost engagement. 

 THE RISE OF B2B INFLUENCE: HOW CREATORS ARE INFLUENCING BUYERS (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 B2B buyers purposefully integrate influencer content into every major
step of the purchasing journey. LinkedIn's recent guide outlines that
credibility and subject-matter expertise are more effective in
converting leads than broad appeal in B2B creator partnerships. It
also highlights that video leads all other formats in engagement and
performance.

 ORGANIC POSTS AND BRAND-VOICE TESTS: HOW ADVERTISERS ARE APPROACHING
THREADS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Threads now has over 350M monthly active users and is available to
all advertisers, but most brands remain in early testing phases. Media
buyers see it less as a place to drive conversions and more as a
platform to explore brand voice and tone through organic posts.
Limited standalone ad options and uncertainty around platform strategy
are keeping investment conservative for now. 

 LEAH'S LEADERSHIP GUIDE - PART 5: EXPERIMENTATION CULTURE (7 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Strong leadership requires fostering a culture where failure is
embraced as a path to learning, not just tolerated. Over 60% of
experiments in a typical B2B SaaS setting fail, so leaders must set
clear, early expectations that define success by learning, not just
positive outcomes. To keep morale high, leaders should balance big,
risky goals with achievable wins using a 70-20-10 mix of safe bets,
incremental gains, and moonshots. Risk conversations must be ongoing,
and leaders need to model vulnerability and failure openly to earn
trust. Organizing learnings in accessible, well-maintained
repositories ensures insights from failures are retained and used.
