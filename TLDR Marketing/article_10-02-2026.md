NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE ADS NO LONGER RUNS ON KEYWORDS. IT RUNS ON INTENT (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google Ads is shifting from keyword-based campaigns to an
intent-first approach. Search now works like a conversation, with AI
inferring user goals and showing ads based on problems users need
solved, not the words they type. Campaigns should be organized around
intent, with broad match, Performance Max, and AI Max used for
AI-driven placements. Landing pages must explain why and how to use a
product, while rich assets and first-party data help the system learn.
The change affects eligibility and targeting. 

 AI DOESN'T REDUCE WORK—IT INTENSIFIES IT (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI can feel like a helpful partner, but it drives juggling multiple
tasks, running parallel threads, and constant output checks. This
creates cognitive load and exhaustion. Employees report high
productivity but rapid fatigue and lost sleep. Researchers recommend
structured AI practices to prevent burnout and separate real
productivity gains from unsustainable intensity.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RUDE MARKETING 101 (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ‘Savage' marketing thrives on clever context and timing. Highlight
why customers switch from competitors and make it visible on your
homepage. Use simple hacks like a direct follow link to boost social
proof. Turn common fears or frustrations into humor that punches up
without looking insecure. Humanize AI or exaggerate minor competitor
missteps to create shareable moments. 

 FLIPPED PHRASE COPYWRITING TECHNIQUE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This technique turns familiar idioms or sayings into B2B ad headlines
by swapping one word for its opposite. Start by generating a list of
common phrases, then flip a key word to create a fresh,
attention-grabbing twist. AI can help suggest options. Finally, pair
the new headline with a CTA and brand logo. This approach makes ads
feel familiar yet surprising.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 AI DISCOVERY HAPPENS OFF YOUR SITE. AIROPS MAKES IT ACTIONABLE.
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 Most AI answers are shaped by third-party content you don't
own—listicles, comparisons, niche publishers, and communities like
Reddit.

AirOps Offsite [9] turns offsite AI visibility into action by showing
which sources matter, helping you land placements at scale, and
measuring impact by topic and prompt.

 ABM: WHAT TO START, STOP, AND SCALE IN 2026 (WEBINAR) [10] 

 ABM isn't a tactic, it's how enterprise customers actually buy. This
webinar, on February 11, will cover which tools are worth using and
how AI can speed processes without adding noise. Learn how to define
audiences and buying groups and how to measure success when
traditional lead metrics don't capture impact. Speakers include the
CMO of Hightouch, the VP of Growth Marketing at Snowflake, and the
Director of Growth Data Science at Ramp. 

 AEO CHECKLIST (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Webflow built a practical 29-item AEO checklist to benchmark
strengths, identify gaps, and prioritize what matters as AI search
evolves. It can also be exported into a CSV file. 

 AMAZON ENABLES COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ADS PLATFORM AND AI AGENTS (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Amazon is testing a new MCP Server that lets AI agents connect
directly to its ads platform and turn simple prompts into full ad
campaigns. The server translates natural language into structured
campaign actions and reduces multi step workflows like account setup,
reporting, and country expansion into single prompts. It supports AI
platforms and works with custom AI agents, while staying compatible as
Amazon APIs change. It also expands on an earlier Ads Agent tool that
enabled conversational control inside the ads console.

 SYNTHETIC PERSONAS FOR BETTER PROMPT TRACKING (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Synthetic personas simulate user behavior using real data to speed up
AI prompt tracking. They solve the cold-start problem and reduce
research time and costs by up to 70%. Teams can test concepts, explore
micro-segments, and filter options before real validation. Each
persona is built from job-to-be-done, constraints, decision criteria,
and natural language to predict query behavior. They are a tool for
exploration, not final decisions, and must be validated with real
users to avoid bias and false confidence. 

 WHY ANTHROPIC IS BETTING ON BEING THE LIKEABLE AI (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Anthropic is building Claude as a friendly, values-driven AI. It uses
warm branding, public stances, and a focus on safety to contrast
OpenAI's defensive, product-first image. The company's growth is
powered by a strong enterprise strategy, including token-based pricing
and specialized coding tools, which give it an edge in high-value
markets. Trust and brand perception act as a multiplier, making Claude
a safer choice for sensitive decisions. 

 THE HIDDEN COST OF ONLY CHOOSING SHORT-TERM WINS (5 MINUTE READ) [15]


 In-house marketing often gets trapped between short-term wins and
long-term strategy. However, framing them as opposites is a false
choice. Performance marketing needs immediate results supported by
brand and messaging developed over time. Lead gen benefits from both
quick conversions and trust built over months. Social media drives
instant engagement while cultivating loyalty over time. Balancing both
ensures short-term actions support sustainable growth.

 WHY LOW FREQUENCY LOOKS EFFICIENT, AND WHY IT'S FAILING IN STREAMING
(2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Low frequency streaming looks efficient because of past brand
conditioning, but capping frequency erodes memory and hurts
performance.
