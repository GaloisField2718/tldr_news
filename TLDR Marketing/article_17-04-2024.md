 Before even using this framework, ensure your product has PMF. Then
conduct research on your target customer, competitors, and market.
This will help to power positioning and messaging. Positioning is the
place a product occupies in people's minds. Messaging is used to
communicate the positioning to customers. A narrative is a story that
stitches everything together to make it stick. Create a GTM plan that
considers the specific channels customers are most likely to find your
product, price and package the product to ensure it matches the
perceived value, and enable internal teams to communicate the value of
the product to customers.
