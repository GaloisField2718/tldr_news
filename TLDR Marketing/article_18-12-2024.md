 3 COMMON SOCIAL MEDIA MISTAKES THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ENOUGH (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Three social media mistakes are asking for reshares, not testing
content variations, and creating content for peers instead of your
audience. Instead of reshares, focus on likes and comments to boost
engagement. Since only a small percentage of your audience sees each
post - about 20% on Instagram - refine and repost content to increase
reach. Lastly, prioritize your audience's needs through keyword
research, social listening, and audience analysis, rather than
catering to peers.

 SATISFICING: WHY CUSTOMERS CHOOSE THE LEAST RISKY INSTEAD OF THE BEST
(3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In the 1970s, IBM maintained market dominance by leveraging its
status as the "safe choice" rather than competing on technical
specifications. Its sales team emphasized IBM's large market share,
robust support, and low risk for buyers, which led to the popular
phrase: “Nobody ever got fired buying an IBM.” Risk aversion
drives many B2B buyers, as they prioritize minimizing potential
failures over seeking optimal solutions. Challenger brands can compete
by exploiting the leader's weaknesses, targeting specific market
segments, or reducing perceived buyer risks with guarantees. These
strategies can help challengers counteract the advantage of
established market leaders.
