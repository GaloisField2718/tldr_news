 ZERO-CLICK SEARCH STUDY: FOR EVERY 1,000 EU GOOGLE SEARCHES, ONLY 374
CLICKS GO TO THE OPEN WEB. IN THE US, IT'S 360 (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The dominance of zero-click searches highlights the need for content
that provides immediate value without requiring a click. With nearly
60% of searches ending without a click, it's important to optimize for
featured snippets, knowledge panels, and other in-SERP content. Almost
30% of all clicks go to Google-owned properties, emphasizing the
challenge of competing within Google's ecosystem. Despite this, the
EU's Digital Markets Act appears to have had some impact, as clicks to
the open web are slightly higher there compared to the US. 

 AI INFLUENCERS ARE GROWING FAST BUT STILL FAR BEHIND THEIR HUMAN
COUNTERPARTS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Human influencers earn an average of $78K+ per post compared to $1.7K
for AI influencers - a 46X earnings gap. Human influencers dominate
brand partnerships, with 37% generating income this way versus 8% for
AI influencers. Engagement metrics also favor human influencers, who
receive an average of 414.8K likes per post, 5.8X more than AI
influencers. AI influencers are more likely to promote adult content,
with 31% involved in such endorsements compared to 15% of human
influencers. AI influencers still struggle to replicate the human
touch that drives higher engagement and trust.

 THE SECRET BEHIND INSANELY MEMORABLE BRANDS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Distinctive and memorable brand assets help a company stand out among
an increasingly distracting world. Aim for 4-5 brand assets, which
could include a color, shapes, storytelling, characters, taglines,
font, or audio. Start by creating 1-2 assets first to build strong
anchors before expanding to more. Avoid assets that are already
connected to the competition or have strong non-brand meanings such as
Coke's green can flop. Low-meaning assets, like Geico's gecko mascot,
can be extremely memorable and effective. Anchor distinctive assets
with the more memorable brand asset, such as your logo. Fight the urge
to change your distinctive assets over time, which can harm your brand
recognition as well as your bottom line. 

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE EMPATHY GAP (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Empathy Gap explains why we often underestimate how much a
buyer's emotional state can influence their behavior and decisions.
People ‚Äî including your customers ‚Äî suck at predicting how they'll
feel and act in the future. Avoid asking customers to predict what
they'll want (or buy) in the future when doing customer research and
instead find the answer in their past behavior patterns. Factor in
‚Äúhot‚Äù emotional states, like hunger or frustration, in advertising
while also framing your product as the solution. Leverage buyers'
rational emotional state to sell subscriptions by framing the purchase
as a way to prevent a future ‚Äúhot‚Äù emotional state. 

 FAST FASHION IS ENTERING A NEW ERA (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The fashion industry is at a pivotal moment, with luxury brands
struggling, e-commerce floundering, and disruptors like Shein rising.
Fast fashion's waste problem is being partly addressed by Shein's
responsive manufacturing, though concerns remain about its
transparency and labor conditions. Key areas to watch include AI
integration in fashion, the growth of the Indian market, and the
industry's efforts to address the climate crisis through waste
reduction.
