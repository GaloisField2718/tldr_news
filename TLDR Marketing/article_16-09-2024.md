NEWS & TRENDS

 ‚ÄòGO WOKE, GO BROKE' NOT TRUE FOR BRANDS, SAYS GLOBAL ADVERTISING
STUDY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Inclusive ad campaigns lead to a 3.5% increase in short-term sales
and a 16% rise in long-term sales. Research shows that even clunky
efforts to portray diverse groups positively influence profits.
Consumers are increasingly drawn to ads that authentically represent a
variety of people, with 62% of buyers choosing products from brands
that embrace inclusivity and 15% becoming more loyal. 

 NEXT GEN INFLUENCE: TRENDS DEFINING A NEW ERA OF BRAND AND CREATOR
COLLABORATION (31 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Economic uncertainty is altering influencer content. The shift is
toward "Relatable Realism," as influencers like Sophie Aris move from
luxury to more achievable lifestyles. Trends such as "The Right to
Reinvention" and "Influential Allies" highlight a focus on
authenticity and active social disruption, while "Credible Creativity"
involves brands collaborating with creators known for unique content.
The "Extreme Influence" trend involves creators using unconventional
methods to capture attention, reflecting a growing trend for brands to
engage in playful and experimental ways.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EMAIL √úBER ALLES: WHY YOU SHOULD CAPTURE CONTACT INFO FIRST (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To reduce form abandonment, collect contact information early in the
intake process. Long forms deter users, so capturing an email or phone
number upfront allows for re-engagement if the form is abandoned.
Tactics like email drip campaigns, personalized messages, and special
offers help recover lost leads and are more cost-effective than paid
channels. Deterministic outreach, using reliable data such as emails
or phone numbers, outperforms probabilistic methods, which rely on
less accurate data like cookies. 

 GETTING BUY-IN FOR CUSTOMER STORIES (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To get buy-in for customer stories, address objections like fear,
inconvenience, and lack of clear benefits. Assure customers they have
control over the final content and emphasize that the process is quick
and simple. Keep the ask short, personal, and safe, avoiding
overwhelming details. Use this 6-sentence framework: why them, why
now, what's the story, what's involved, the benefits, and the next
steps. 

 APPSUMO $100MN PLAYBOOK (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AppSumo's revenue grew from $100K in 2010 to over $100M by 2021
through a mix of community-building, strategic leadership, and revenue
diversification. Its key tactics included personalized email
marketing, viral giveaways, and launching the AppSumo Marketplace,
which allowed third-party vendors to list products. AppSumo Plus and
Originals further expanded its revenue streams, creating a
self-sustaining ecosystem.

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES CONFIDENTIAL MATCHING FOR DATA PRIVACY (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Google has announced confidential matching, a privacy-first tool that
uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to secure first-party data
for audience targeting and campaign measurement. The solution ensures
that sensitive business data is isolated and protected, even from
Google, during processing. It is now the default for Customer Match in
Google Ads as part of Google's broader privacy initiatives.

 HOW TO BECOME A 10X MARKETER BY 'REVERSE ENGINEERING' (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Morning Brew reached over 4 million subscribers by deconstructing and
rebuilding successful referral campaigns, such as its "Refer 50, Get a
Mug" initiative. The campaign turned typical referral programs into a
viral loop by setting achievable goals and offering social-friendly
rewards. Through reverse engineering, marketers can systematically
study the psychology and tactics behind successful campaigns and remix
these elements to fit their brand's unique needs. 

 NET PROMOTER SCORE IS A SCAM, HERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE (6 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 NPS lacks reliability as it doesn't explain the ‚Äòwhy,' overlooks
neutral experiences, and remains too static. By contrast, quarterly
sentiment or "perception measurements" track user sentiment on
important topics over time, offering a fuller understanding of
customer experience. To implement this, define key categories for your
product or service, gather feedback from channels like social media
and customer service, apply sentiment analysis tools to score
feedback, and organize results by topic and sentiment score. 

 MENTAL AVAILABILITY: HOW TO MAKE YOUR BRAND THE OBVIOUS CHOICE (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Mental availability ensures customers think of your brand when they
reach a buying trigger. Rooted in availability bias, it shows how what
we frequently think about shapes decisions. To build it, go beyond
measuring direct conversions, invest in channels that keep your brand
memorable, and create a distinct message and identity.
