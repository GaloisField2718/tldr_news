NEWS & TRENDS

 TAKEAWAYS FROM SENSOR TOWER'S STATE OF MOBILE REPORT (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Social apps remain the most downloaded and widely used. In-app
purchases are growing significantly as platforms integrate more
shopping features. Time spent on short-form video continues to rise,
with US Facebook users increasing time on Reels by 17% in 2024. Global
app usage trends show that downloads grew in many regions, while time
spent on the top 10 apps decreased by 10% from 2021 to 2024. This
reflects shifts in entertainment preferences like short-form videos
and streaming. 

 IS META BRINGING BACK THE ACTIVITY FEED? (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta's recent Instagram updates reflect a shift back toward social
connections and fundamentals. The introduction of Edits, a
video-editing feature positioned as a CapCut alternative, aims to
streamline creator workflows and capitalize on TikTok's uncertain US
future. Changes like bringing back friend-based activity in Reels and
testing vertical profile grids suggest a renewed focus on meaningful
engagement. These updates hint at a strategy to blend transparency,
community building, and creative collaboration.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE GTM INFLECTION POINTS THAT POWERED CLAY TO A $1B+ VALUATION (19
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Clay's go-to-market strategy started by focusing on a narrow ICP of
cold email agencies, enabling rapid feedback and targeted growth. Its
unique “reverse demo” approach put customers in control, building
confidence in the product while generating insights on areas for
improvement. From leveraging the halo effect of organic LinkedIn posts
to creating new roles like GTM engineers, Clay demonstrated how
unconventional decisions can sustain fast revenue growth across
product-led and sales-led motions. 

 POPPI'S MARKETING STRATEGY (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Poppi rebranded from “Mother Beverage” in 2020 and established
itself in the functional beverage market with prebiotic sodas that
promote gut health. Its marketing focuses on Millennials and Gen Z,
leveraging social media, influencer collaborations, and experiential
events like pop-ups to build a loyal community. Poppi's premium
pricing reflects its high-quality ingredients, while its data-driven
strategies refine its campaigns and offerings. The brand also uses
educational content to build trust and highlight product benefits.
These tactics have positioned Poppi as a leader in health-conscious
beverages. 

 USE MARKETING PSYCHOLOGY WITH THE HALO EFFECT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The halo effect is a cognitive bias where positive impressions in one
area influence perceptions of the whole. For instance, if a brand
produces engaging and high-quality free content, such as podcasts or
case studies, prospects naturally assume its paid services are equally
high quality. This is especially critical in 2025, where B2B buyers
self-educate via social media, content platforms, and communities. By
polishing key touchpoints that matter to customers, brands can use the
halo effect to drive authority, trust, and sales more efficiently than
traditional persuasion methods.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 COMMUNICATING MARKETING STRATEGY: PLAN-ON-A-PAGE, INTEGRATED CAMPAIGN
AND BUDGET TEMPLATES (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Annual financial and marketing planning requires detailed campaign,
budget, and tactic preparation. Integrated campaigns, supported by
tactic calendars, content maps, and high-level planning tools, should
focus on themes that address buyer pain points and last at least six
months. Effective budget planning combines initial allocation, ongoing
tracking, and prioritization models like “how would we spend $100”
to maintain flexibility for unforeseen demands. The article contains
free templates for an annual plan-on-a-page, campaign planning, and
campaign strategy.

 Napkin acts as a digital notebook for brainstorming and note-taking,
using AI to create links between related concepts and surface
connections you might not initially see. Its intuitive interface
allows for free-form input, while its AI-driven insights provide
structure to scattered thoughts, making it useful for anyone managing
complex ideas.

 THE HARDEST PART ABOUT MARKETING? UNWANTED FEEDBACK (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Customer feedback is unavoidable. 72% of customers share positive
experiences while 13% amplify negative ones to larger audiences. For
brands, the key lies in both listening and taking timely action, since
6 out of 10 customers can be won back with the right response within a
week. Investing in CX teams to manage and respond across platforms not
only protects brand reputation but also creates a competitive
advantage as AI search increasingly integrates reputational data into
query results.

and creative teams that offers tools for budgets, deadlines, and

for the company include leveraging review sites, offering templates as
lead magnets, and showcasing successful client use cases. 

 HOW I TURNED A MARKETING MISTAKE INTO $1 MILLION IN NEW BUSINESS (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 PostcardMania noticed a slowdown in top-line revenue growth when a
mistake caused postcard mailings to drop from 205,000 to 195,000
weekly. Restoring the volume and further increasing it to 260,000
resulted in over $1 million in new revenue, showing the effectiveness
of a tried-and-true marketing tactic. This example highlights how
growth can be achieved by identifying high-performing strategies from
the past and adapting them to the new context instead of trying
something completely new every time.
