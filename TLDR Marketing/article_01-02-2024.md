and quality of your learning. Growth sprints are a simple 5-step mix
of agile and the scientific method that involves the whole company.

 THE WORST USERS COME FROM REFERRAL PROGRAMS, FREE TRIALS, COUPONS,

organic ones. They generally have considerably lower lifetime value
and engagement. Referral programs, free trials, coupons, and
gamification can cause negative selection, increase fraud, and promote
cannibalization. A successful acquisition program must prioritize
quality and avoid relying solely on incentives to hit its short-term
targets. 

 HOW LEGO USES BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In 1958, LEGO finalized its signature brick design and secured the
patent ‚Äì today it‚Äôs a $11.8 billion brand and remains a household
name. The company benefits from ‚Äúthe IKEA effect,‚Äù which is that
people value things more when they build them. LEGO also invested in
strategic partnerships to create a sense of unity with new audiences.
The brand is supported by the mere exposure effect of a consistent
block design advertised with familiar colors and uses. Brands can
apply the same principles of single-product focus to stand out and use
partnerships to reach new customers.
