 GOOGLE ADS ALTERS DESIGN, BROAD MATCH, PAYMENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google has implemented several significant updates in the past couple
of months that impact all advertisers to varying degrees. The new UI

features a new admin menu. ‚ÄúBrand inclusions‚Äù, which instruct
Google to show ads only when the brand is included, are now available
for campaigns solely using broad match keywords. Negative keywords
will now consider misspellings of a word, rather than only considering
the exact keywords. Google will no longer accept credit or debit cards

bank payments.

 HOW TO CREATE A VALUE PROPOSITION: A FOUR-STEP FRAMEWORK (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Your value proposition is at the heart of all your go-to-market
activities ‚Äì particularly in the startup stages. First define the
problem, while assuming that people don't want more products. Ask
yourself what the risk or consequence is that's associated with the
problem, which is the customer pain point. Next, list your product's
capabilities and connect them to the problems you've identified in the
prior steps. The more thoroughly you solve the issue, the more
interested people will be. Finally, prove that your product solves the
problems with customer case studies. With all of this information, you
can now summarize your value proposition - use no more than two
sentences.
