 THREADS SPOTTED EXPLORING ADS, BUT SAYS ‚ÄòNO IMMEDIATE TIMELINE'
TOWARD MONETIZATION (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Multiple developers and reverse engineers have uncovered references
to ad products in the Threads app's code, including the word ‚Äúads‚Äù
itself, as well as references to sponsored items and ads
configuration. However, Instagram says it's not testing ads in the app
and has no immediate plans to monetize. The head of Instagram stated
in April that Meta definitely plans to bring ads to Threads
eventually, but Zuckerberg himself has said the team must first focus
on retention and improving the basics.

deals or coupons than they did in the past (28%), buying cheaper
brands (21%), or buying fewer school supplies than they did in

 HOW TO FIND MICRO-INFLUENCERS FOR YOUR BRAND (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A micro-influencer typically has somewhere between 5,000 and 30,000
followers and tends to focus on a specific niche. Partnering with
these creators generally results in lower campaign costs, more quality
engagement with followers, and more relatable and authentic content
compared to mega influencers. Find micro-influencers by using an
influencer directory, using filtered search on social media platforms,
searching through your brand's followers, or asking your community.

 THREE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT ADOBE'S SEO & BLOG DESIGN (3 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Adobe's SEO strategy, driven by content featuring high-quality
images, useful tools, custom experiences, and expert opinions,
generates nearly 80 million in monthly traffic. Its site ranks for
commercially-aligned keywords, such as "infographic examples", and
maximizes the traffic value with a custom page template featuring
built-in CTAs. Adobe uses page design to improve the user experience
and truly meet search intent, unlike some other SEO heavyweights. The
white space on each side and the text spacing also make the blog
content much easier to skim and digest than other competing sites.

 Authenticity is now crucial, as brands must align their values with
the content they sponsor to avoid consumer backlash. This shift has
led to a rise in co-promotion opportunities, where brands partner with
entertainment companies to capitalize on popular content. Companies
like Amazon and Creative Artists Agency are developing new branded
entertainment units in response to this demand. Additionally, brands
are collaborating with entertainment firms to share content creation
costs, especially as marketing budgets become more constrained.
