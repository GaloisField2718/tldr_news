MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Certain types of friction in customer experiences can enhance
satisfaction and create memorable moments. Good friction, like the
anticipation while unwrapping a chocolate or the effort in assembling
Ikea furniture, activates dopamine and makes these moments more
enjoyable and memorable. To leverage this effect, companies should
minimize bad friction while incorporating good friction. This involves
evaluating friction points in the customer journey and ensuring that
any friction present heightens the contrast with peak positive
moments.
