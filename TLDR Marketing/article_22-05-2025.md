NEWS & TRENDS

 ARE YOU READY FOR AGENTIC AI SHOPPERS AS CUSTOMERS? (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 AI agents can now complete purchases using network-issued tokens from
major payment networks such as Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, making
them more seamless and secure. The buyer journey is being compressed
into background processes where bots search, buy, and handle returns
without any human input. Brands that want to sell to agentic AI
shoppers need to have machine-readable product data, API-integrated
inventory, and AI-friendly post-purchase flows. 

 HOW FAN-FIRST STRATEGIES CAN ENABLE BRANDS TO HARNESS THE POWER OF
FANDOM (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 40% of UK consumers say content quality has worsened. Brands are
turning to fan-first live experiences to reconnect. With 80% of Gen Z
and 72% of Millennials reporting loneliness, and marketing budgets
shrinking by 4.8% in Q1 2025, spend on live events and brand
experiences have grown by 5.4% as a way to foster real connection.
Fan-first strategies prioritize storytelling, inclusive exclusivity,
subcultural relevance, and purposeful partnerships to deliver
emotional resonance in a fragmented digital world.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW THE OVSIANKINA EFFECT GREW LEADS BY 53% (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SFG20 increased lead capture by 53% by redesigning its demo request
form into a two-step process. The original form had multiple required
fields, which lowered completion rates, but shortening it wasn't an
option due to lead quality needs. The variation initially showed only
three fields, then revealed more after the user started, leveraging
the Ovsiankina Effect. This reduced perceived friction and encouraged
more users to complete the form. 

 USE STARS ★ NOT NUMBERS FOR RATINGS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Visual product ratings like stars or bars are perceived as higher
than number-based ratings, leading to greater purchase intent. In
experiments, a 3.7-star rating was judged 25.7% higher and chosen 64%
more often than the same number shown numerically. Ads using visual
ratings had a 52.6% higher click-through rate than those with numbers.
This effect is driven by left-digit bias, which causes people to
mentally round down numerical ratings. 

 3 WAYS TO BE STRATEGIC WHEN MARKETING IN A RECESSION (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Brands that stay visible during recessions tend to recover faster and
build stronger long-term growth. Instead of cutting spend entirely,
shifting to focused campaigns allows companies to stay present in the
market while controlling costs. Leveraging employee advocacy can
increase reach and engagement without additional spend. Lastly,
partnering with an external PR firm ensures consistent messaging and
helps navigate uncertain times, protecting brand trust.

 TOP WAYS TO ENSURE YOUR CONTENT PERFORMS WELL IN GOOGLE'S AI
EXPERIENCES ON SEARCH (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google has published new documentation on how to succeed in Google
Search, including AI Overviews and AI Mode. Pages must provide a good
user experience, be technically accessible for indexing, and use
accurate structured data. Supporting content with quality images and
videos helps with multimodal searches. Site owners should value user
engagement over click volume, as AI-driven traffic often leads to more
meaningful interactions. 

 DISTRIBUTION PLAYBOOK FOR B2B COMPANIES WITH LONG SALES CYCLES (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Stop creating more content and start maximizing what you already
have. Identify relevant topics from customer and sales insights, then
record 1-hour interviews with 3 internal subject matter experts. Turn
each session into a long-form article, video clips, and LinkedIn posts
shared from personal profiles for higher reach. Repurpose content
across your site, YouTube, and newsletters. After 3 months, boost top
posts with Thought Leader Ads. At 6 months, expand reach through a
LinkedIn employee advocacy program using the same content.

 BEYOND EMPOWERMENT: THE NUANCES OF WOMEN'S REPRESENTATION IN MEDIA (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Shows like “Dying for Sex” and “Yellowjackets” move beyond
the empowered woman trope. They reveal that autonomy is internal and
activated through complexity, not granted by others. Their success
shows audiences are ready for richer, non-linear portrayals of women's
inner lives. For brands and media looking to connect meaningfully with
women, this means moving past surface-level portrayals to embrace
vulnerability, rawness, and the full spectrum of selfhood through
deeper storytelling. 

 IS GOOGLE ABOUT TO REOPEN THE TRAFFIC FLOODGATES? (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Google has started rolling out its Discover feed on desktop, a
feature previously limited to mobile that shows personalized news
headlines on the homepage. This change could generate a significant
spike in traffic for major publishers, as desktop usage often drives
higher engagement. Smaller independent creators are excluded, and the
shift may incentivize content tailored to algorithmic preferences over
audience needs and interests.
