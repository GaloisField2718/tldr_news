STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO TURN LOW TRAFFIC A/B TEST IDEAS INTO ONES YOU CAN ACTUALLY RUN
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To run A/B tests with low traffic, use higher-frequency goals like
add-to-cart actions instead of orders, or micro-conversions such as
clicks to key pages. Limit your test to a single variation to reduce
the traffic needed for statistically significant results, and test
additional variations iteratively. Increase the minimum detectable
effect to 30% to lower the required traffic, but only if your
variation is bold enough to produce a noticeable impact. Avoid
unreliable metrics like time on page or scroll depth, which can lead
to false positives. 

 FLASH SALES WITHOUT BRAND DAMAGE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Flash sales work best when urgency is built through dynamic low-stock
alerts, tiered discounts for early buyers, and personalized timers
based on user behavior. Segment audiences to re-engage lapsed
customers, clear seasonal overstock, and revive inactive lists with
one-day events. Coordinate messaging across email, SMS, and ads to
prevent fatigue and protect ongoing campaigns. Limit exposure for
recent buyers and promo-only shoppers to maintain list quality. Use a
warm-up phase to tease offers, a short focused launch, and a cool-down
to retarget non-buyers.

 GOOGLE MERCHANT CENTER NOW RECOMMENDS PRODUCT'S BRAND NAME IN TITLE
(1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google Merchant Center recommends adding the product's brand name at
the beginning of titles when the brand is a key differentiator. This
update aims to help shoppers quickly identify products and build trust
by showing who makes them. While not yet mandatory, prepping titles
now can improve click-through and conversion rates, ensure better
search matching, and keep you ahead of potential enforcement. Avoid
using your store name unless you manufacture the product. Brand names
should only reflect the actual maker.

LIAISON (4 MINUTE READ) [10]

end of May. The feature introduces keywordless targeting based on
landing page content and ad assets, while still supporting traditional
keyword match types. Enhanced controls, geo-targeting options, and
detailed reporting will also be part of the rollout. Early results
show up to 27% more conversions for campaigns using exact and phrase
match.

 WEBSITE PERFORMANCE BUDGETS ARE KEY TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE INTERNET (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Modern websites are often bloated, with the average page size more
than doubling in the past decade. This increases energy use and slows
performance. A performance budget sets limits on factors like page
weight and load time to reduce digital carbon footprints and improve
user experience. These budgets must be integrated early in the design
process and included in client briefs to guide sustainable
decision-making. 

 TWO WAYS TO CROSS THE CHASM (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The “chasm” describes the gap startups face when shifting from
early adopters to mainstream users who expect more than just a
product. To cross it, most companies focus on one niche and deliver a
complete solution, including support, training, and integrations.
Others like Notion, Slack, and OpenAI succeed by gaining massive
adoption through a product-led approach where individual users quickly
find value and share it widely. This large user base builds
credibility and often creates the ecosystem needed for broader market
adoption.
