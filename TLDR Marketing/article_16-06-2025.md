NEWS & TRENDS

 ‘THE ATTENTION DIVIDEND' – PREMIUM LARGE FORMAT DOOH COMMANDS 5X
MORE ATTENTION THAN DIGITAL CHANNELS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Premium large format Digital Out of Home (DOOH) ads are far more
effective at capturing attention than online digital formats. They
generate 5X more attention and hold it significantly longer. Viewers
engage with these ads 8.2X longer than online display, 5.5X longer
than social media, and 1.6X longer than online video. They also drive
up to 2.5X higher brand recall and brand choice when using video
creatives. This increased attention is linked to long-term brand
profitability, especially when premium DOOH is combined with standard
OOH. 3D DeepScreen formats also boost brand desirability by 32%. 

 AI NEEDS EXPERIENTIAL MORE THAN EVER—AND EXPERIENCES NEED AI (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In an era overwhelmed by digital noise and fake content, brands must
shift from screen-based interactions to immersive, sensory experiences
that feel real and emotionally engaging. Simply adding chatbots or
basic AI won't cut it anymore. The future lies in AI-driven
experiences that adapt in real-time, connect with human behaviors, and
blend physical and digital worlds seamlessly.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE EMPLOYEE ADVOCACY PLAYBOOK (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Employee advocacy means employees voluntarily sharing company content
on their personal social media. It drives 8X more engagement than
brand accounts. People respond to real, human posts, not
corporate-sounding updates or heavily filtered messages. Brands should
support willing employees with quality content, guidance, and trust
while avoiding micromanagement or forced participation. 

 THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU CLICK ‘UNSUBSCRIBE' (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cybersecurity experts warn that clicking “unsubscribe” links in
unwanted emails can be risky. One in every 644 clicks leads to a
malicious site. Interacting with spam confirms an active email
address, increasing the risk of further attacks. Some links may also
attempt to steal passwords or install malware. It is safer to avoid
unsubscribe links within email bodies from unknown senders and instead
use built-in email client unsubscribe features, mark messages as spam,
or set up filters.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 CHATGPT TIP (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Users can now choose the model when using any GPT in ChatGPT, even if
they didn't create it. This gives Plus, Pro, and Team users more
control by letting them override a creator's model choice. Just click
the GPT name, select “Model,” and choose your preference.
Custom-action GPTs are limited to GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, and the feature
is currently available on web only. Creators should note that using
reasoning models may reveal internal instructions. 

 INSPIRING CREATIVITY THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER (3 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Instagram is aiming to make the platform a space where people feel
safe taking creative risks. New features include video editing tools
like Edits and AI-powered restyling, low-pressure posting options like
Trial Reels and Quiet Mode, and grid customization. Instagram is also
launching a “Drafts” initiative to support emerging creators
financially and creatively.

 HAS FATHER'S DAY GRIEF BECOME A MARKETING TOOL? (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Bloom & Wild launched the first opt-out emails for sensitive
occasions in 2019, with 17K customers opting out in the first 24
hours. While initially seen as compassionate, the surge of similar
messages from other companies has made the gesture feel performative
and overwhelming. Grief counselors say these emails can be intrusive
and trigger pain rather than comfort. In response to the backlash,
Bloom & Wild stopped sending opt-out messages in 2024 and now offers a
preference center instead. 

 WE STUDIED THE IMPACT OF AI SEARCH ON SEO TRAFFIC. HERE'S WHAT WE
LEARNED (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI search traffic is projected to surpass traditional search traffic
by early 2028, possibly sooner if Google AI Mode becomes the default.
The average AI search visitor is worth 4.4X more than a traditional
one due to higher conversion rates. ChatGPT and other LLMs often cite
content from lower-ranking traditional search results, focusing on
information relevance over page ranking. Quora is the most cited
domain in Google AI Overviews, followed by Reddit. Half of ChatGPT
links point to business or service websites.
