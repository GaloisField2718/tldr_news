 SHOPPABLE AD FORMATS ARE MAKING STREAMERS LOOK MORE LIKE QVC (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The shoppable trend integrates commerce directly into content,
allowing users to buy products within articles, videos, or social
media without leaving the platform. While this seamless shopping
experience boosts convenience, it presents challenges such as content
overload and the need for brands to balance authenticity with
commercialization. Competition is fierce, with major platforms like
Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube continually enhancing their shoppable
features. 

 SOCIAL COMMERCE THRIVES WHEN MERCHANTS TACKLE TRUST ISSUES (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Social commerce is growing, with U.S. sales expected to surpass $100
billion by 2025, largely driven by platforms like TikTok Shop.
However, trust concerns persist, with 52% of shoppers citing security
as a barrier and 44% needing more trust in platforms to shop. Despite
this, younger shoppers are more likely to adopt social commerce, with
34% of 18- to 34-year-olds shopping weekly. To boost adoption, brands
must focus on building trust by ensuring secure transactions and
showcasing social proof.

users in nine countries to show publishers the potential traffic loss
without Google. This follows the EU's push for Google to compensate
news outlets, which has already led to costly licensing deals under

MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Since Elon Musk's acquisition of X, ad revenue has fallen
significantly, with a 68% decline in spending from top advertisers in
