NEWS & TRENDS

 PHYSICAL PRODUCTS ARE BACK (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Digital fatigue is driving a resurgence in physical products as
consumers seek tangible experiences. Americans check phones over 140
times a day, and ages 8-24 spend up to 56% of waking hours on screens.
Yet 96% of digital detox attempts fail within a month. In response,
markets like brand gifting, vinyl records, and collectible card games
are growing rapidly. Other categories, such as board games, candles,
and stationery, are also seeing increased adoption. 

 AI TOOLS COULD DRIVE $263 BILLION IN HOLIDAY SALES (10 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Walmart, Target, and Etsy are adding AI assistants to help shoppers
discover products, compare prices, and complete purchases. Shoppers
using AI are 30% more likely to buy and spend 14% more time on sites,
increasing revenue per session by 8%. Brands are updating product
listings with detailed descriptions and solution-focused content to
perform better in AI searches.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 INSIDE PRODUCT HUNT'S COMMUNITY-LED GROWTH STRATEGY (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Product Hunt grew by making community validation its main growth
engine instead of paid or viral tactics. It focused on a curated
audience of makers and early adopters, with 57% of traffic direct and
most users aged 25-34, creating urgency through one-day launches and
six-month relaunch limits. It scaled from 4,000 to 100,000 users by
prioritizing density over scale, using invite-only access and active
participation in comments. Community-led growth can outperform
traditional GTM when identity and curation come first. 

 SHOULD YOU PITCH JOURNALISTS FROM AN AGENCY OR BRAND EMAIL ADDRESS?
(5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Who a pitch is sent from changes how journalists engage. Agency
addresses drive higher opens (41.5% vs. 35.7%) because agency-written
subject lines are more urgent and emotionally compelling. Brand
addresses drive about 60% more replies due to stronger perceived
authority. The strongest results come from agencies sending pitches
from brand domains, combining higher open rates with higher reply
rates.

 WE BUILT A FREE TOOL TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT CHATGPT SEARCHES (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This free Chrome extension reveals the queries ChatGPT generates
behind the scenes, giving SEOs insight into how AI interprets search
intent. It intercepts fetch responses, extracts the hidden
search_model_queries field, and displays the reformulated queries in a
floating panel. It shows how ChatGPT removes filler words, adds
context, and expands one prompt into multiple searches, helping SEOs
match content to AI phrasing and discover new query variations. The
extension runs locally, installs in about 2 minutes, and lets users
copy queries or export history to CSV. 

 CREATE MARKETING CLIENT NOTEBOOKS WITH NOTEBOOKLM (1 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Client notebooks in NotebookLM centralize all client context in one
place. Each notebook should include sales notes, kickoff transcripts,
home page copy, and the XML sitemap. It should also include materials
that define the target audience, brand voice, and KPIs. Teams can use
structured prompts in NotebookLM to extract goals, audience needs, and
differentiators for SEO, copy, reporting, and sales.

 WHY AI DOESN'T MEAN THE END OF FREEMIUM (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI does not kill freemium because users must experience value before
paying. Freemium is the fastest way to teach new AI categories. AI
products run on 20 to 40% margins versus 80% plus for traditional
SaaS, so freemium should be treated as a marketing expense rather than
a cost center. When the upgrade trigger happens after real value is
felt, conversion follows, as shown by a 3 to 5% freemium to paid rate
after users hit a clear usage limit. Freemium should continue after
conversion through small free moments that sustain habits and drive
word of mouth growth. 

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF FEEDBACK DESIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The way performance scores are displayed influences how users
perceive quality. Cumulative formats reduce the impact of negative
feedback and support trust, while incremental formats highlight each
rating and push accountability. When both are shown, users focus on
the most extreme score, usually negative. Display formats can be
adjusted by user type. New users benefit from progress visibility,
while experienced ones prefer consistency. This approach can shape
behavior without altering the data. 

 THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL LOOKS LIKE INTIMACY AT SCALE (6 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Connection through storytelling defined Glossier's strongest moments
this year. From GRWM routines to ASMR textures and mood-led creator
content, the brand favored intimacy over polish. TikTok Shop reshaped
how content supports commerce, while feedback loops with the community
informed product evolution. Content was crafted to feel personal and
immersive, even at scale. Glossier is now moving toward richer,
serialized formats and physical experiences that build trust and
reinforce the brand's cultural positioning.
