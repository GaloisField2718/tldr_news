NEWS & TRENDS

 MOST OF INSTAGRAM'S ADS RAN ON REELS IN 2025 (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Over half of Instagram ads ran on Reels last year. Reels accounted
for 46% of time spent on Instagram. Advertisers are following users to
short-form video, even as monetization lags behind the main feed. Amid
competition with TikTok and YouTube Shorts, Reels drives user
retention and a $50B annual run rate across Meta's platforms. 

 THE YEAR OF THE GREAT FRACTURE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 2026 is shaping up as a year of fracture, where the “middle” has
collapsed. The average customer no longer exists. Markets are
splitting into clear extremes with different needs, resources, and
behaviors. AI is commoditizing speed and efficiency, making trust the
only real moat. Influence is moving from public platforms to private,
owned channels. The winners are decisive operators who pick a side and
act while others keep hedging. 

🚀 

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 E-COMMERCE TIP: WIN BACK LOST CUSTOMERS AFTER CANCELLED ORDERS (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After a customer has refunded or cancelled an order, send a survey
email asking for the reason. Provide the most common answers that are
simple to decide between, and use links to collect the response. Once
the user clicks a link, save that option under their profile. From
that, create a Cancelled/Refunded Order Winback Flow with personalized
emails based on the survey answer they selected. 

 HOW TO GENERATE AN EXTRA $1M FROM RETENTION (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Focus on fixing what is already broken instead of sending more
campaigns. Identify where customers drop off, which products drive
churn, and what delivery or support issues create friction. Lock in
core flows like welcome, post-purchase, abandoned cart, replenishment,
and winback before increasing broadcasts. Simplify segmentation and
sharpen messaging so value is clear. Use post-purchase email to reduce
regret and set expectations. Maintain a tight learning loop where
every send drives a clear decision. 

 HOW MODERN ANIMAL GOT 50M VIEWS IN THREE MONTHS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Instead of educational or polished brand content, Modern Animal
shifted to filming veterinarians mic'd up during real appointments,
capturing candid conversations and behavior that viewers normally
never see in veterinary clinics. Led by a two-person creative and
social team, the strategy relied on multi-angle footage and minimal
editorial framing, which helped a single post break out to 25M+ views
and accelerate follower growth. The visibility translated into higher
site traffic during viral periods and increased comfort among
potential customers who said the content reduced anxiety about what
happens when pets go “in the back”.

industry-leading brands like Airbnb and Microsoft to see how they
PREVENT AI SLOP, set REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS, and BUILD THOUGHTFUL AI

use AI as a force multiplier. [11] 

 YOUTUBE DISTRIBUTION IS TILTING TOWARD SHORTS, PRESSURING LONG-FORM
REACH, DATA SUGGESTS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 YouTube distribution is shifting toward Shorts, which is cutting
long-form reach for many creators. Analysis of more than 500 channels
shows average long-form views fell from about 150,000 to about 60,000
per upload, and the top 100 YouTubers saw a roughly 50% view drop in
one week. Homepage space for long-form videos shrank from about ten
slots in 2024 to two or three in 2025, while Shorts visibility from
homepage and search roughly doubled versus 2024. Older Shorts now lose
promotion after about 30 days, and AI-generated channels add pressure
by capturing 63 billion views and an estimated $117 million in annual
revenue. These shifts concentrate long-form views among fewer channels
and raise sustainability risks since Shorts earn less revenue and
require higher output. 

 7 INFOGRAPHICS FOR YOUR 2026 MARKETING STRATEGY (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This post introduces 7 infographics that translate common 2026
marketing challenges into execution frameworks, including system-based
planning, integrated inbound-outbound motion, and content mapped to
how buyers actually progress. It highlights practical shifts such as
broadening audience scope without chasing empty reach and prioritizing
existing customers as a growth lever through offer expansion and
pricing strategy. None of these approaches work without an annual
review of marketing foundations, where fresh customer research
directly informs positioning decisions and budget allocation.

 ANTI-ENGAGEMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A new generation of creators is redefining influence by embracing
mystery instead of full transparency. They use anti-engagement
strategies like erratic posting, faceless profiles, and selective
disclosure. This makes audiences actively seek them out. Followers
form devoted, idea-driven communities rather than casual fans.
Influence is based on a worldview or aura, not lifestyle visibility.
By resisting algorithms and controlling access, these creators make
their presence compelling through what is withheld. 

 GENAI, THE SNAKE EATING ITS OWN TAIL (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI weakens the ecosystems it relies on. Models trained on human
content extract value without attribution or revenue for creators.
This accelerates the decline of open source and publishing. The result
is a broken incentive loop that risks a long-term content collapse. A
proposed fix is pay-per-use AI, with source citations and revenue
sharing, so creators, users, and AI companies all benefit.
