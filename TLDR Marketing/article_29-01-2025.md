NEWS & TRENDS

 EXPLICIT ADS ARE PLAGUING YOUTUBE, AND IT'S ONLY GETTING WORSE (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Reports of explicit ads appearing on YouTube have gone up
significantly, with users getting increasingly concerned about the
platform's content moderation efforts. A new incident shared on Reddit
involved a child mistaking an adult film actor in an ad for a popular
game streamer while watching Fortnite videos. While the platform
claims to have blocked 5.5 billion ads and suspended 12.7 million
advertiser accounts in 2023, growing evidence suggests its safeguards
remain inadequate.

their opinions during the consideration phase and 70% during the
purchase phase. The study also found that consumers value Snapchat
creator recommendations more than those on other platforms (64% vs.
52% respectively).

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE PRODUCT AND SERVICE-BASED B2BS (1 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 To differentiate your brand, establish a unique, recognizable process
that stands out. Back up your claims with specific, measurable results
to show value. Highlight overlooked strengths that resonate with your
audience. Challenge industry norms with bold statements to position
your product as the alternative. Lastly, build trust with guarantees
that go beyond typical offers. 

 HOW TO DECIDE THE IDEAL PUBLISHING FREQUENCY FOR SOCIAL MEDIA, BLOGS,
EMAILS, AND MORE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Determining the ideal publishing frequency requires understanding
audience behavior, leveraging data from tools like analytics or A/B
tests, and aligning content schedules with audience needs and industry
trends. Consistency is critical. Post multiple times daily on
platforms like Instagram and tailor email campaigns to optimal times,
such as avoiding Mondays and Fridays. Flexible strategies that adapt
to seasonal patterns, viral success, or emerging industry trends can
maximize engagement and make content resonate with customers.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO PROOF: HIGHLY EFFECTIVE WAYS TO BOOST YOUR
COMPANY'S CREDIBILITY (AND SALES) (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Visitors don't trust companies that fail to provide credible proof of
their claims. Effective proof elements include data, testimonials,
guarantees, social proof, demonstrations, and celebrity endorsements.
daFlores increased sales by 44% by showcasing Facebook followers,
while Geeks2U boosted calls by 49% with a strong guarantee. Businesses
should uncover hidden proof, rank and test it for effectiveness, and
invest in acquiring persuasive evidence. Trust in a company and trust
in a product are separate issues, both of which must be addressed to
drive conversions.

 HOW ADS FOR MEAT, MILK, AND EGGS SELL YOU A FANTASY (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Meat, dairy, and egg marketing relies heavily on imagery to shape
consumer perceptions. Symbols like red barns and green pastures
suggest idyllic farming conditions, but in reality, most animals are
confined in industrial facilities, where a single farm may house over
1,300 pigs or 50,000 chickens. These misleading visuals hide the harsh
conditions of factory farming, making consumers believe in a sanitized
version of industrial agriculture.
