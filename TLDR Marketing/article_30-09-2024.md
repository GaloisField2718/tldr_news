 UNPACKING NERDWALLET'S SEO: 10 THINGS I DISCOVERED (8 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 NerdWallet's SEO performance faltered in 2024, losing 6 million in
organic traffic due to Google's core update, seasonal search demand,
and increased competition from specialized sites and its own financial
partners. The company responded by enhancing content trustworthiness
and strategically redirecting pages to regain some lost traffic. Its
SEO still drives significant revenue, but diminishing returns from
programmatic content and competition from partners like Chase pose
ongoing challenges. 

 GROWTH STORY OF REDDIT TO 1 BILLION MONTHLY USERS - A TACTICAL
PLAYBOOK FOR FOUNDERS AND MARKETERS (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Reddit's growth from a niche forum to 1 billion monthly users was
fueled by UGC and strong community engagement, with subreddits
allowing users to create niche communities around specific interests.
Early on, Reddit's founders faked user activity to make the platform
seem active, which helped attract real users. The introduction of AMAs
and a mobile-first strategy also played a critical role in driving
user engagement. 

 THE FUTURE OF SEO IS USER-GENERATED CONTENT (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The future of SEO is moving toward User-Generated Content (UGC) as AI
takes over traditional content creation and search rankings. Platforms
like Miro, Notion, and Canva have leveraged UGC to fuel growth with
user-created templates and resources. While UGC requires long-term
investment and user incentives, it offers a competitive edge that's
hard to replicate. Companies can improve SEO and deepen user loyalty
by embedding UGC into activation and re-engagement journeys.
