NEWS & TRENDS

 AI SHOPPING TOOLS THREATEN AFFILIATES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ChatGPT, Gemini, and Google's AI Overviews could disrupt affiliate
marketing by giving direct product recommendations that bypass review
sites, reducing traffic and altering attribution during the holiday
season. This may hurt ecommerce merchants that rely on affiliates for
low-cost customer acquisition, as fewer clicks could mean fewer sales.
Some AI-driven sales may still come from affiliate-generated content,
but without commissions, affiliates may create less content in the
future. 

 AS TARIFFS HIT, BIG COMPANIES DOUBLE DOWN ON MARKETING (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Executives at major companies are maintaining or increasing marketing
investments despite tariffs, inflation, and weaker job growth. Ralph
Lauren raised marketing spending to 7.5% of sales from 6.7% last year,
while Church & Dwight and Molson Coors plan to protect spending even
at the cost of short-term earnings. Gartner data shows that over
two-thirds of US consumers are adjusting their spending due to
economic pressures. Yet companies like Kenvue and McDonald's remain
focused on brand visibility, product innovation, and value, believing
this will strengthen their position when conditions improve.

EXPERTS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 11 experts share strategies that delivered strong Google Ads results
in the past 6 months. Their approaches included segmentation and
consolidation to boost ROAS, focusing on unit economics for clearer
strategies, and returning to basic marketing principles that lifted
CTR by up to 67%. Other tactics involved using feeder strategies to
cut CPA by 60%, enriching conversion tracking with server-side tagging
and customer data, and building optimized landing pages to drive
higher-quality leads. Experts also stressed the value of continuous
self-development, blocking time for experimentation, mastering
fundamentals before automating, and leveraging AI with the Google Ads
API to build custom tools. 

 THESE KINDS OF SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEOS ARE MOST LIKELY TO CONVERT
SHOPPERS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Informal, first-person TikTok videos lasting 10-15 seconds
consistently drive the most product sales. Over half of social media
users say content on platforms like TikTok and Instagram directly
influences their purchases, and 45% are more likely to buy trending
products. Around 70% use social media to decide if an item is worth
buying, with verified reviews as the most trusted source. Everyday
users are trusted for recommendations by 66% of people, compared to
49% for influencers and 38% for celebrities.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 CREATOR EARNINGS REPORT 2025 (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The creator economy has grown 19% since 2024 to $250B. Yet over 57%
of full-time creators earn below the US living wage of $44K, and more
than half make under $15K annually. NeoReach identifies a $15K
“monetization barrier,” where income growth accelerates once
surpassed, but most remain below it due to limited monetization
options, content constraints, and weak revenue strategies. Brand
deals, the top revenue source for 49% of creators, are down 10% from
last year as more shift to ad revenue and self-owned brands. Creators
who prioritize monetization earn over twice as much as others,
averaging $132K.

 YOUR BRAND CAN STAND FOR TWO THINGS AT ONCE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Challenger brands can compete with category leaders by using a
multi-message positioning that pairs two distinct associations instead
of focusing on one. New Balance combines sports and culture through
celebrity campaigns, fashion collaborations, and products that blend
performance with style. Joe and the Juice pairs health with a rockstar
vibe, creating a lively and distinctive brand experience that stands
out from typical wellness-focused juice bars. Multi-message strategies
offer differentiation, depth, and defensibility, but they also require
strong guidelines and consistent execution across all touchpoints. 

 THE GREAT DIVERSIFICATION: HOW 8 COMPANIES ARE EVOLVING THEIR SEO
STRATEGIES (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI-driven search changes are forcing brands to diversify beyond
traditional SEO, with strategies spanning social-led thought
leadership, selective content gating, aggressive programmatic
publishing, and more. Companies like Seer Interactive, HubSpot,
Customers.ai, Nerdwallet, and Tally are blending owned media growth
with multi-channel discoverability. The common thread is building
resilience by owning audiences and reducing vulnerability to algorithm
shifts.
