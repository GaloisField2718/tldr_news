NEWS & TRENDS

 AMERICANS' SOCIAL MEDIA USE 2025 (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Instagram now reaches 50% of adults in the US. It has joined YouTube
and Facebook as the only social media platforms to achieve majority
adoption among Americans. Its growth from 40% in 2021 signals a shift
from a younger audience to the mainstream. Other platforms continue to
rise, including TikTok at 37% and WhatsApp at 32%. 

 THE B2C AI MARKETING IMPACT REPORT (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Marketers feel a powerful mix of optimism and urgency around AI. 92%
view its impact positively. At the same time, many teams still lack
the budgets, data activation, and workflows needed to use it
effectively. Most organizations need 2-7 days to act on new insights,
which slows progress and weakens AI's value. This gap between ambition
and execution fuels overconfidence and widens the disconnect between
how marketers believe AI performs and how customers actually
experience it.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 4 EMAIL PRE-HEADER TESTS TO TRY (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Pre-header tests worth trying include removing the pre-header
entirely for a clean inbox preview, using continuation words like
“and”, “but”, or “plus”, adding emojis only in the
pre-header, and starting with short parenthetical cues such as
“(quick)” or “(don't skip)”. Each tactic can lift open rates,
but performance varies. Run structured A/B tests in your ESP to see
what resonates with your audience. 

 GROW REACH WITH THOUGHT-LEADER ADS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When a LinkedIn post gains traction, build momentum instead of
stopping at organic reach. Boost the strongest posts as thought-leader
ads, then use the new engagement to retarget and run follow-up
campaigns that fit your GTM approach. This turns individual posts into
a steady growth engine.

 IG'S NEW FEATURES FOR REELS CAMERA (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Instagram updated its Reels camera to make capturing and editing
videos easier in the app. The most significant change is the ability
to record up to 20 minutes. Instagram only recommends Reels under 3
minutes and limits distribution for longer clips. It also improved
editing by adding a simple Undo option and a slider to control Touch
Up intensity. The update includes enhancements to green screen tools,
timers, and countdowns so users can produce smoother clips in-stream.

across teams.

 STUDY FINDS SIZE REALLY DOES MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO HOME SCREEN ADS
(2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Connected TV home screen ads deliver the strongest attention.
Audiences view 76% of these ads, and 59% of that viewing counts as
active attention, which means eyes on both the screen and the ad. They
also generate 2.5x more active attention than linear TV and avoid the
steep drop seen on social platforms, where 80% of attention
disappears. The viewing device drives attention more than the platform
or creative. As measurement improves, CTV home screens will become
even more valuable for high engagement. 

 HOW VINE'S SIX-SECOND VIDEOS BUILT THE BLUEPRINT FOR TIKTOK (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Vine created the core format that powers TikTok, Instagram Reels, and
YouTube Shorts. Its 6-second-long looping videos became the foundation
of the modern short-form ecosystem. Vine's technical innovations
shaped today's platforms, and its role in launching major creators
showed the potential of the format. Its failure came from weak creator
monetization, a problem that still affects platforms. The platform's
cultural and design impact remains central to how billions consume
content, even as new startups try to revive its original appeal.
