 HALO EFFECT: WHY GREAT BRANDS ARE BUILT IN DETAILS (5 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The Halo Effect is when a customer‚Äôs positive experience with one
aspect of a company gives them a favorable opinion of the brand as a
whole. For example, Ritz-Carlton gives any employee the authority (and
the budget) to solve a customer problem, which in one case caused a
guest to take his business conference to its hotels. Brands can
achieve this by chasing excellence in every detail of the customer‚Äôs
experience. On the other hand, having a wide range of products or
services risks the Horn Effect, which is the opposite of the Halo
Effect.
