READ) [7] 

 Brands need to personalize their outreach by focusing on individual
influencers and their preferences. Combining no-strings-attached and
barter deals can offer flexibility while ensuring content creation.

posting rates while reducing waste. Seeking usage rights for
influencer content helps maximize its value across marketing channels.
To prevent devaluing products, brands should manage gifting volume
carefully and space out activations with repeat influencers.

MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article explores the strategic use of user-generated content
(UGC) to enhance brand visibility and boost sales. UGC provides social
proof, making it easier for potential customers to relate to and trust
a brand. To encourage UGC, brands can create Instagrammable moments,
run contests, and engage directly with customers, fostering a sense of
community and encouraging more content creation. This approach not
only reduces content creation costs but also enhances brand
credibility and engagement.

 IMPROVE GROWTH MINDSET IN YOUR COMPANY WITH A WEEKLY EXPERIMENT
REVIEW MEETING (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Without the Growth Mindset, your company will not have predictable,
sustainable, and defensible growth. Creating an internal
experimentation program reinforces the Growth Mindset, especially when
everyone understands the goal is learning, not nonstop wins. The
program should include a weekly Experimentation Review Meeting in
which you review results, get feedback, and make decisions. Async
rituals, such as experiment-focused Slack channels, are also useful to
ensure everyone has visibility into active tests, initial results, and
failures. 

 CANDID FEEDBACK ABOUT CONTENT MARKETING JOB TESTS (6 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Companies need to stop requesting free work from job candidates. Some
marketers avoid roles requiring unpaid tasks, while others complete
assignments only to be ghosted or see their ideas used without credit.
Instead of large projects, companies can ask candidates to share
highlights of their previous work or discuss anonymized examples of
their strategies. They can also compensate candidates for interview
assignments, portfolio reviews, and case study presentations.

sentiment.
