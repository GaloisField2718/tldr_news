 AI FOR MEDIA CAMPAIGNS: MARKETERS ARE MORE WORRIED ABOUT POOR DATA
THAN JOB DISPLACEMENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The IAB surveyed 500+ agencies, brands, and publishers to create the
first industry benchmarks on AI adoption in media planning,
activation, and analysis.

Get the State of Data 2025 report [4] to benchmark your performance
across 18+ AI use cases — including a companion guide [4] with
hands-on implementation roadmaps.

Some of the surprising findings include:

 	* Job displacement ranks dead last among concerns at just 37% -
behind data quality, security, and fragmented tech.
 	* 70% haven't fully scaled AI yet, but half expect to reach full
integration by 2026.
 	* Agencies and publishers are moving faster than brands.

NEWS & TRENDS

 VIBE MARKETER BECOMES #1 NEW MARKETING ROLE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI is creating a new position called the vibe marketer. This role
combines engineering, design, and analysis, allowing one person to
handle tasks like building landing pages, writing ad copy, automating
workflows, and running experiments without cross-functional support.
Marketing teams will shift from 10 specialized roles to leaner groups
of generalists who use AI to do the work of five people. Job postings
like “Vibe Marketing Manager” are signaling that companies are
already moving in this direction. 

 CHATGPT VS GOOGLE AI: 62% BRAND RECOMMENDATION DISAGREEMENT (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Brand visibility does not translate equally across AI platforms.
Google's AI Overviews, AI Mode, and ChatGPT disagree on brand
recommendations 62% of the time. Only 17% of queries show the same
brands across all three. Google's AI Overviews surfaces brands most
often, appearing in 36.8% of queries and averaging 6.02 brands per
query, compared to ChatGPT's 2.37 and AI Mode's 1.59. ChatGPT doesn't
mention any brands in 43.4% of queries, while AI Mode is silent 46.8%
of the time, versus just 9.1% for AI Overviews. Alignment is highest
in ‘compare' queries at 80% and lowest in ‘best' queries at 23%.
Healthcare queries show the greatest disagreement rate at 68.5%.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WAYS COMMUNITY CAN HELP YOUR SEO (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Engaging in existing communities can strengthen SEO without the
effort of building one from scratch. Brands can earn trust,
visibility, and authority by joining relevant groups, offering help,
and avoiding direct selling. Community participation also improves
content quality since real conversations provide valuable insights,
questions, and collaboration opportunities. Over time, this approach
helps build a stronger brand presence in search results, social
platforms, and word-of-mouth recommendations. 

 YUKA APP MARKETING STRATEGY: WHY GEN-Z TRUSTS THIS PRODUCT SCANNER
OVER BRAND MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Yuka, a free mobile app launched in 2017, has grown to over 56
million users in 12 countries. It offers independent health ratings
for food and cosmetics. Yuka has never used paid advertising, instead
growing through authentic user sharing, including a viral TikTok
moment that drove global expansion. The app is fully funded by user
fees and does not allow brands to influence scores, which has created
strong trust among consumers. Its impact is clear, with 85% of U.S.
users changing purchasing habits based on ratings and 94% globally
stopping purchases after poor scores. This pushes brands to
reformulate products and treat Yuka scores as a competitive benchmark.

 REPOSITION YOUR BRAND USING AI IN 25 MINUTES (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most brands compete on obvious benefits, which creates
commoditization and forces price-based competition. This guide
provides a 3-step process that uses AI to identify positioning angles
competitors cannot claim, reframe weaknesses into strengths, and
create new categories. The 25-minute process involves analyzing
competitor messaging, running AI prompts for positioning discovery,
reframing weaknesses, and developing category-creation messaging.

 YOUR ICP STARTS AS AN ASPIRATION AND BECOMES A REGRESSION (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 A good ICP starts as aspirational but must quickly become analytical.
For growth-stage marketers, that means reporting pipeline and revenue
by ICP tier, aligning on what “best customer” means, and using
regression to identify true success predictors. It is not enough to
simply segment by title, industry, or tech stack; it is critical to
quantify which traits correlate with renewals, expansion, and win
rate. 

 WILL AI COMPANIES PAY PUBLISHERS? (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI companies are starting to consider payments to publishers as tools
like Perplexity propose $42.5M in compensation and industry protocols
like the IAB's CoMP emerge. CoMP aims to let publishers block AI
crawlers and charge for content use. Only Google and Meta are involved
so far, but it may gain more traction soon. For marketers, this could
shift how high-intent content is sourced and monetized.
