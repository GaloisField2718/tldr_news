NEWS & TRENDS

 REPORT: PINTEREST DRIVES MORE ‚ÄòTOTAL ATTENTION' THAN OTHER APPS (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pinterest has published a new study that underlines the value of
capturing both ‚ÄúPassive Attention‚Äù and ‚ÄúActive Attention‚Äù in
ads, which can help drive more interest and action in response. Active
Attention captures immediate focus, while Passive Attention reinforces
messages subconsciously. Passive Attention techniques are more
efficient and cost-effective, driving 6.7X more attentive seconds per
dollar spent compared to Active strategies. Ads that produce stronger
emotional responses can amplify attention by 50%. Ads with a high
concentration of happiness and surprise drive more total attentive
seconds than ads with a low concentration of happiness and surprise.
Pinterest excels in Total Attention (Active + Passive), generating
170% more Total Attention and 7.3X more Passive Attention than other
platforms. 

 QUEER INFLUENCERS ARE FEELING THE PRIDE MARKETING SQUEEZE (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Pride has been the biggest month of the year for brand sponsorships
for many queer influencers. However, this year, these influencers are
seeing much fewer opportunities as brands' appetites for Pride
marketing have weakened amid widespread pressure from anti-LGBTQ+
groups. Some brands are retooling how they engage with the LGBTQ+
community, which may mean investing in queer-identifying communities
year-round as opposed to just during Pride month.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE POST-PURCHASE EMAIL NO ONE IS SENDING: THE PRODUCT ACTIVATION
EMAIL (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Brands should send a follow-up email a couple of weeks after a
customer's purchase asking if they're satisfied with the purchase,
then make a segment of those who are satisfied and those who aren't
and trigger a plain-text customer support email for dissatisfied
customers. Unsatisfied customers can be excluded from emails, such as
review requests. This strategy allows you to collect customer
feedback, generate better reviews, drive product adoption, and turn
negative experiences into positive ones. 

 CASE STUDY: HOW REFRAMING A CHOICE BOOSTED PAID SUBSCRIPTIONS BY 19%
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mobbin, a mobile and web design reference library, originally showed
a Free vs. Paid benefits comparison when Free users interacted with a
paid feature. The team tested removing the Free column and instead
focusing on the Paid plan, reframing the options as ‚ÄúPaid or
skip‚Äù. This provided more space on the screen to add additional
context about the Paid plan. The changes resulted in a 29% increase in
visits to the pricing page (where users sign up for Paid) and a 19%
increase in paid subscriptions. 

 HOW RIPPLING BOOSTED THEIR BLOG TRAFFIC BY 10X IN ONE YEAR (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Rippling, an HR and finance platform, increased its blog traffic from
2,380 to nearly 30,000 monthly visitors in one year by focusing on
geo-specific keywords and producing targeted content. Its team
conducted thorough keyword research to identify location-based terms
that potential customers were searching for, then created hundreds of
blog posts optimized for these keywords. The advantages of this
strategy include providing highly relevant content to users, low
competition, and higher conversion. The downsides are that the content
has limited reach, is resource-intensive to produce, and requires
frequent updates.

 4 PERFORMANCE MAX SEGMENTATION STRATEGIES AND HOW TO LEVERAGE THEM (7
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The pros and cons of 4 different PMax segmentation strategies. High
margin segmentation, which separates top products from the long-tail,
is common but is usually driven by bad assumptions. Product type
segmentation groups similar products together, which can be effective
if the grouping is done right. Brand and non-brand segmentation is
sometimes effective, but often solves a problem that doesn't exist.
Customer segmentation based on nCAC/LTV often has significant errors
due to its complexity and can ultimately squeeze margins. Regardless
of which segmentation strategy is used, every PMax account should have
Zombie SKU campaigns, which include products that have low historical
volume, and a Catch-all, which helps ensure you aren't missing
anything in your build. 

 HOW TO FIND PRODUCT-MARKET FIT: 5 STRATEGIES FOR WEB3 (10 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Product-market fit is defined as the alignment of a product's value
with customer needs. It's important to design network effects from the
start and use tokens to create self-reinforcing incentives, enhancing
the product's value as more people use it. Engaging with early
adopters or ‚Äúsmart‚Äù users is also crucial, as these users help
shape the product roadmap. Identify and reward genuine power users to
build a strong community. Investing in developers through token grants
can also drive growth.
