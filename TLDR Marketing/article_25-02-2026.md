NEWS & TRENDS

 SEARCH ISN'T JUST TURNING TO AI, IT'S BEING RE-MONETIZED: TEXT ADS
ARE TAKING A BIGGER SHARE OF GOOGLE SERP CLICKS (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Organic search is losing share as Google increasingly favors paid
placements. From January 2025 to January 2026, classic organic clicks
fell sharply across major verticals. Text ads gained 7-13 points, and
paid clicks in product categories like headphones rose from 16% to
36%. Google AI Overviews expanded across SERPs, but zero-click rates
stayed mostly stable. The shift is toward paid rather than fewer
clicks overall. Brands are boosting paid spend to offset organic
declines, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of competition. 

 ‘WE'RE LOSING ACCESSIBILITY': AMERICA SAYS GOODBYE TO THE
MASS-MARKET PAPERBACK (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mass-market paperbacks are disappearing across the US. They were once
cheap and portable, making reading accessible to working-class
Americans. Popularized from the 1930s, they were sold in supermarkets
and non-bookstore outlets. The format offered affordability and
portability that helped democratize literature. Sales have declined
steadily over the decades. E-readers and smartphones have replaced
their convenience. Readers now value books as aesthetic objects. This
shift limits low-cost access for young and lower-income readers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 KEEP YOUR ADS AWAY FROM TOXIC CONTENT (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ads placed beside unsafe content harm brand perception. In one case,
favorability fell up to 19% and trust in a telecom brand dropped 17.8%
when its ad appeared next to antisemitic material. Even hearing about
the placement lowered opinions by 17.7%. Immediate brand statements
raised trust by 18.1%, while delays weakened recovery. Tight placement
controls and rapid response protect trust. 

 LINKEDIN EVENTS FOR LEAD GENERATION: HOW TO MARKET, ENGAGE, AND
CONVERT (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 LinkedIn events can drive strong B2B leads when planned early,
promoted across channels, and followed by structured outreach. Launch
2-4 weeks ahead, reinforce value with regular updates and polls, then
repurpose the recording into 5-10 short clips and practical resources
to extend reach. Segment attendees by engagement and use automated
personalized follow-up to sustain momentum. Weak messaging and poor
follow-up cause warm leads to fade.

specialist work. These mini agents activate automatically in chat and
chain together to deliver targeted outputs beyond generic prompts. The
system was trained to score ads, scan competitors, and generate
creative using a six-factor weighted framework. It covered elements
like hook strength and message clarity, grounded in principles from
David Ogilvy and Claude Hopkins. It generated an 11-page analysis of
110 competitor ads in minutes. 

 WHAT IS GOOGLE'S PREFERRED SOURCES? (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google's Preferred Sources is a personalization feature that allows
logged-in users to prioritize specific publishers within the Top
Stories section. Available globally for English-language queries that
trigger Top Stories, it lets users select preferred domains or
subdomains, which can then appear in a dedicated “From your
sources” box and within standard results. For publishers facing
reduced visibility from AI summaries and zero-click search, the
feature offers a way to strengthen loyalty and increase repeat
exposure. While Google does not yet provide analytics to track
preferred source performance, publishers can drive adoption through
on-site CTAs, newsletter messaging, social promotion, and visible
follow buttons. 

 OPENTABLE LAUNCHES AD BUSINESS TO PITCH DINING DATA (2 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 OpenTable is expanding beyond reservations with OpenTable Media, a
new ad business built around its dining audience and transaction data.

offsite using aggregated insights, and host branded experiences within
its 60K-restaurant network. Early pilots with Diageo, Ghirardelli, and
Cobra Beer validated demand as brand inquiries accelerated over the
past two years.

 THERE'S A SHORT WINDOW TO GET RADICALLY AHEAD BY GOING AI-NATIVE (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The real risk is not AI replacing jobs but individuals staying
passive while a brief window rewards those who go fully AI native.
Instead of debating flaws, use AI as the default engine for writing,
coding, and problem-solving so the gap between idea and execution
collapses. The advice is to directly build a rough version of your
company's core workflow with AI, retry tasks as models rapidly
improve, launch a scrappy side project, and learn from AI native
peers. 

 THE CEO MUST BE THE CMO (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Declining CMO tenure and marketing's absence from boards reflect a
leadership problem, not a marketing one. Creating and delivering
customer value is the core of the business, so marketing cannot sit in
a silo. The CEO must own marketing at a strategic level to align
brand, product, pricing, and customer experience with company goals.
Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos treated marketing as inseparable from
innovation and culture. When the CEO champions the customer, insight
flows across functions.
