 HOW SIMPLIFYING A HOMEPAGE BOOSTED SIGN-UPS BY 9% (3 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Mobbin, a UI inspiration platform, found from research that users
rated its ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù page as more useful than its homepage. The
‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù page included two benefits that were particularly
persuasive, while the homepage used a carousel to present a broad view
of the service. The company tested a new version of the homepage that
removed the carousel, mentioned the two key benefits from the ‚ÄúLearn
More‚Äù page, added social proof, and clarified the free account CTA.
This resulted in a 9% increase in free signups and a 55% increase in
paid subscriptions. 

 THE SMARTER-NOT-HARDER GUIDE TO CONTENT MARKETING (7 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Classic content marketing focused on high-volume keywords and Google
rankings is outdated. You now need an audience-first approach that
identifies where your audience spends their time and fits into those
spaces. Find your audience's sources of influence through surveys,
interviews, and broad data sources. Use keyword research, audience
research, and social media listening to find resonant topics. Select
the right content format based on audience behavior and preferences.
Monitor competitors and find opportunities for co-marketing and guest
posts. Finally, distribute content effectively and continually test
and repurpose.

 HAS SOCIAL MEDIA MADE SIGHTSEEING DEEPLY UNCOOL? (8 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Gen Z grew up online, watching friends and influencers travel the
world and digesting aspirational travel media touting hidden gems.
Such overexposure creates an added pressure to distinguish our
vacations with unique experiences. People's definition of social
status is no longer immediately tied to wealth but by showcasing their
culturedness and expertise with symbols. Consequently, many are still
traveling to the world's most famous cities, but are choosing to
highlight more off-beat experiences within them. 

 WHEN UGC GOES WRONG: HOW SMART BRANDS REACT TO CONTROVERSY (4 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Companies should prepare a crisis communication plan to use in the
event that misinformation, misleading content, negative UGC, or hoaxes
about the brand begin to spread online. Never attack an online user
directly and only respond to a harmful message if it gets widespread
attention first. When responding, consider the objective of your
message and explain the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù in your response.
