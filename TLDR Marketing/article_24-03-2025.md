NEWS & TRENDS

 META CONTINUES TO INTEGRATE AI BOT PROFILES INTO ITS APPS (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Meta plans to introduce millions of AI-generated profiles that will
post, comment, and engage on Facebook and Instagram, mimicking real
users. These profiles will include bios and visual identities, making
them largely indistinguishable from standard human accounts. Meta's
goal is to increase engagement by populating feeds with AI-driven
social activity. 

 34% OF FORTUNE 500 FIRMS LACK A CMO (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Only 66% of Fortune 500 companies had a marketing leader in 2024,
down from 71% the year prior, with large gaps across sectors. 80% of
tech companies had a CMO compared to just 51% of industrial firms.
One-third of marketing leaders didn't hold a “chief” title, while
16% had dual roles blending marketing with revenue or customer
oversight. These shifts reflect marketing's growing integration into
broader business strategy, often extending beyond the traditional CMO
role.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 INBOX ANARCHY: AN AUDIENCE-FIRST EMAIL MARKETING STRATEGY (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Marketing leaders don't need more content, they need better curation
to make smarter decisions. Convince & Convert rebranded its newsletter
to The Trendline to focus on strategic insights, broader curation, and
a clearer format. Delivering immediate value without requiring clicks,
the new structure includes key sections like “The Big Picture” for
strategic takes, curated links, and interactive audience polls.
Successful email marketing today requires audience research,
zero-click content, and curated insights that build trust and
authority. 

 HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY PITCH OR START A PODCAST (24 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To become a podcast guest, research the podcast, reference past
episodes, and pitch a relevant idea. Personalize pitches using
transcripts and prioritize quality podcasts by checking rankings on
Listen Notes or Rephonic. Podcasters should focus on valuable content,
repurpose episodes across channels, and leverage video for platforms
like YouTube. 

 HOW TO DO SEO FOR GOOGLE MAPS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google ranks businesses in Maps based on relevance, distance, and
prominence, which includes online reputation and citations. To improve
placement, businesses should claim and verify their Google Business
Profile, ensure consistent NAP (Name, Address, and Phone) data across
directories, and accumulate positive reviews. Engagement metrics like
click-through rates, clicks to call, and direction requests also
influence visibility and ranking.

 DEAR MARKETERS, SHOULD YOUR FOUNDER BE AN INFLUENCER? (14 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Credible founders with strong opinions can outperform company brands
on LinkedIn, especially with an active audience and marketing support.
Instead of having executives write from scratch, marketing should
capture insights from conversations, voice notes, or Slack threads and
repurpose them into short-form content aligned with company messaging.
Posts should reinforce 3-4 core brand themes, be published
consistently, and include real-time engagement to boost visibility in
LinkedIn's algorithm. 

 YOUR GUIDE TO BUILDING A SOCIAL MEDIA PORTFOLIO (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A well-structured social media portfolio should highlight both
creative execution and strategic thinking. Minimal text is best,
letting the work speak for itself with a design inspired by social
media feeds. Tools like Gondola help track past work by aggregating
posts and metrics. Documenting work as it happens makes portfolio
building easier, and crediting collaborators adds transparency.
Starting with a basic Notion page or a list of links is a good first
step.
