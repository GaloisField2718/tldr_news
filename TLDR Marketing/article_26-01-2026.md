NEWS & TRENDS

 OWL LABS' 9TH ANNUAL STATE OF HYBRID WORK REPORT (18 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Hybrid work is a lasting model. Employees strongly protect
flexibility even if it costs pay or productivity. 90% of workers feel
stressed, and 39% say it increased year over year, while 89% say a
supportive manager is one of the most important workplace factors. 69%
of managers believe that working hybrid/remotely has made their team
more productive. “Microshifting” is gaining traction, as 65% of
workers want structured flexibility through short, non-linear work
blocks. AI adoption is widespread - 80% of employees already use it at
work, and 51% are open to an AI avatar attending meetings. 

 56% OF CEOS SEE NO AI IMPACT, BUT MARKETING IS THE EXCEPTION (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Most CEOs still see limited financial returns from AI. 56% report no
impact on revenue or costs. Only 30% see revenue gains, and 26% see
cost reductions. A clear internal gap is forming. 43% of C-suite
leaders say AI saves them 8+ hours a week, compared with just 5% of
workers. Meanwhile, 40% of employees report no time savings at all. As
budgets shift from experimentation to accountability, pressure is
rising for AI to prove real value. Marketing stands apart. AI is
already shaping brand visibility and directing much of media spend,
making it one of the few clear near-term enterprise wins.

Treat customers as the hero and show how your solution helps solve
real problems. Build credibility through thought leadership and
empower employees to share authentic stories. Share value directly in
feeds with zero-click content, lean into relatable and entertaining
posts, and expand reach through partnerships with credible external

 WHATSAPP VS. SMS: WHAT GLOBAL BRANDS REALLY NEED TO KNOW (5 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Choosing between WhatsApp and SMS should start with regional user
behavior, not pricing. SMS performs best in North America, while
WhatsApp drives stronger engagement across much of Europe and Latin
America, where it is the default messaging app. Cost only becomes
relevant after channel fit, shaping how frequently brands send
messages and which moments truly justify mobile interruptions.

 HOW SEOS ARE USING COMMON CRAWL'S WEB GRAPH DATA FOR AI RANKING
SIGNALS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI visibility is increasingly tied to how often a site appears in
Common Crawl data, and that frequency is influenced by link-based
authority metrics like Harmonic Centrality (HC) and PageRank. Common
Crawl uses HC to determine crawl priority, and sites with higher HC
scores are crawled more frequently. More frequent crawling means more
appearances in monthly archives, which means greater representation in
AI training data. Research also shows that traditional Google rank
still matters. Position 1 pages have a 46-48% chance of AI citation
versus about 19-20% at position 10. 

 IT'S TIME TO START YOUR CONTENT CREATOR ERA (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Building and growing a personal audience is becoming a major
advantage for hiring and company growth. Creator skills translate
directly to marketing and distribution, and an existing audience acts
as a built-in trust signal and channel. Startups increasingly treat
employee social followings as assets, while employees who publish
consistently can stand out in hiring. The practical path is to focus
on one platform, speak in your own voice, stay in a clear niche,
engage heavily in comments, and commit to the long term.
