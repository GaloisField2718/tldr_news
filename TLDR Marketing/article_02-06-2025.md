NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE AND THE ART OF WEAPONIZING PRIVACY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google has repeatedly used privacy as a pretext to restrict
competitors' access to valuable user data while continuing to collect
and exploit it through its own platforms. In 2011, it blocked access
to search keyword data, crippling tools used by rivals like Facebook
for ad targeting. More recently, it announced plans to end third-party
cookies in Chrome and eliminate Android's Advertising ID, moves that
weaken independent ad networks while preserving Google's dominance
through its first-party data. These actions reduce competition and
innovation in the tech industry, concentrating power and data within
Google. 

 9 PREDICTIONS ON THE FUTURE OF B2B MARKETING (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI-native businesses are outpacing legacy companies by building
faster, using real-time feedback, and embedding AI at their core. As
AI lowers the barrier to product creation, the focus is shifting to
growing engaged audiences and communities. B2B creators with niche
followings will gain influence, often earning equity in exchange for
audience access. The most effective approach will combine high-quality
content at scale, buyer intent tracking, and warm outbound outreach.
Strategic thinking, video, and creativity will become more valuable as
AI agents take over much of the execution.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO REPOSITION A PRODUCT AS A PRODUCT MARKETER (6 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Start by clarifying business objectives and securing leadership
buy-in. Conduct deep customer research to define target segments and
buyer needs, then identify your true competitive alternative. Use
these insights to develop a positioning brief that includes a clear
narrative, differentiators, and messaging pillars. Align
cross-functional teams through a focused workshop, followed by
internal enablement and external rollout plans. Avoid skipping
research, neglecting core customers, misaligning teams, or mistaking
repositioning for rebranding. 

 2+1 POWERFUL WAYS TO ACQUIRE AND CONVERT MORE WITH JOBS-TO-BE-DONE
(10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Push and pull forces drive product adoption, while inertia and
anxiety often prevent conversion. Jobs-to-be-done interviews help
uncover how these forces influence customer decisions by mapping the
timeline of events leading to adoption, stagnation, or churn. Speaking
with power users, recent adopters, and those who left reveals
actionable patterns in motivation, hesitation, and unmet expectations.
This approach surfaces gaps in perceived value and misaligned
messaging, helping teams focus on what actually moves users through
the decision funnel.

 HOW TO MANAGE CUSTOMER FEEDBACK WITH AI (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Even though 85% of product leaders believe customer-focused companies
perform better, most companies struggle to act on customer feedback
because it is hard to organize. AI can streamline this process by
helping teams collect, tag, cluster, and prioritize feedback from
multiple sources like surveys, reviews, and support tickets. This
article presents a 3-step framework focused on collecting, organizing,
and acting on feedback by linking it to business goals and customer
insights. It includes templated AI prompts to carry out the framework.

 HOW SUBSTACK IS REMARKABLY CHANGING THE GAME FOR GOOD (5 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Substack has surpassed 5M paid subscriptions, adding nearly 1M every
quarter. It now supports over 50K income-generating publishers.
Substack succeeds where traditional social media fails by giving
creators direct audience relationships, no algorithmic interference,
and built-in monetization. Writers typically grow through 3 stages:
foundation, acceleration, and exponential "hockey stick" growth. The
top 10 earners collectively make $40M annually. Tools like Notes and
A/B testing drive engagement and retention, with 72% of subscribers
staying past 90 days and only 8% actively churning. 

 ALMOST HALF OF GOOGLE SEARCHES ARE BRANDED (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Branded searches make up 45.7% of total Google search volume. 36.9%
of unique queries include a brand name. Users aren't just looking for
a homepage, they're seeking specific content like support pages,
product comparisons, reviews, or local listings. If these results
aren't optimized, it can lead to a poor experience or even competitor
visibility. Branded search isn't just about ranking, it's also about
shaping how people engage with your brand once they already know it.
