 ALL THE THINGS PEOPLE USE AI FOR IN 2025 (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AI is now predominantly used for emotional and life support,
including therapy, life organization, and finding purpose. It also
plays a major role in content creation, enhancing learning, generating
code, and fostering creativity. Unlike in 2024, when AI was primarily
used for idea generation and specific searches, the focus has shifted
to mental health support and personal assistance. The use of AI for
research and fun activities has declined, while its role in technical
and creative tasks has expanded.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 UNDERRATED STRATEGY: BUILDING INDUSTRY JOB BOARDS (4 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Hosting a niche job board can position your brand as a trusted
industry hub, driving traffic, links, and goodwill. Start by picking a
narrow focus, setting up a standalone site, and using automation to
source jobs ethically. Subtly brand the board and create a viral loop
through job alerts, easy submissions, and shoutouts. Promote it via
newsletters, podcasts, communities, and forums. Over time, monetize it
with featured listings and sponsorships. 

 YOUR #1 MARKETING CHANNEL IS PEOPLE'S EGOS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Wiz boosted its social shares by 300% by giving out personalized
"Cloud Security Excellence" certificates after challenges. It made
recipients' names the largest element on the certificates, tapping
into people's desire for status and recognition. 50% of Wiz's
customers joined its “Zero Critical Club” after receiving
certificates for eliminating critical security issues. The
personalized certificates worked because they triggered pride, created
a sense of community, and required almost no effort to share.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

onboarding sequences, resource newsletters, and quarterly product
updates. It includes QA checklists, audience insights, performance
tracking, and key metrics. With strategic content creation, timing,

 CHATGPT BRINGS “DEEP RESEARCH” TO FREE USERS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI is expanding access to its deep research capabilities by
launching a lightweight version of the tool for free users. Free users
can now complete up to 5 research tasks per month with responses that
maintain depth and quality. Premium subscribers will retain full
access to the original model - the free version will be powered by the
o4-mini model and will provide shorter outputs. 

 THREADS IS GOING ALL IN ON ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Meta is expanding ads on Threads, ending its mostly ad-free
experience that had only shown limited ads to users in the US and
Japan. Threads is also adding features like a ‘+' button for easier
post creation, the ability to copy posts as images, and a multi-column
view for web users. New menu buttons for Liked and Saved posts, tabs
for custom feeds, and a feature to import followers from other
platforms are being introduced. Threads has also switched its domain
from Threads.net to Threads.com.

 HOW TO BUILD THE PRODUCT MARKETING CAREER YOU WANT (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Promotion is not the only way to grow a product marketing career.
Alternative paths like freelancing, consulting, and pivoting to
related fields are valid and often better suited to personal goals.
Career growth is a loop, not a ladder, and includes stages like
learning, mastery, and reinvention. The author recommends writing a
future vision story, brainstorming 2-3 paths to reach it, and taking
small real-world steps to test them. 

 THE LENNY RACHITSKY PLAYBOOK: PROMPTS, GROWTH FRAMEWORKS, AND
STRATEGIES (17 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Lenny Rachitsky grew from writing free essays in 2019 to over 1M
newsletter subscribers and $2M+ annual revenue by 2024. He prioritized
giving value, moved to Substack for email control, launched paid
subscriptions, and built a 20K+ member Slack community to boost
retention. Growth came from using Substack's Recommendations,
launching a top tech podcast with 10M+ downloads, and offering bundles
to drive upgrades. His freemium model converted about 5%, with
content, community, and podcasting fueling self-reinforcing growth
loops.
