 WHY BIG COMPANIES MAKE BAD CONTENT (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Hubspot published a ‚Äúhow to buy bitcoin stock‚Äù article, which
doesn't relate to its offerings. This article explores why this
strategy might actually be deliberate. Every published URL is a chance
to acquire backlinks and an opportunity to get your brand in front of
thousands of new, otherwise unfamiliar people. This traffic will
typically convert at a low rate, but over time it can have a
meaningful indirect impact on revenue. Large-scale content creation is
marginally cheap so there is little to no opportunity cost for
creating more ‚Äúbad‚Äù content.
