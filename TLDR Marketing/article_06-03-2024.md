STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE DRIVES YOUR POSITIONING (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Don‚Äôt differentiate on features alone, because every product
category will eventually have the same features and functionality.
Microsoft, Discord, and Slack are all communication tools with the
same basic features, but their marketing is differentiated by who
they‚Äôre targeting to use those features. It is generally better to
target a niche rather than trying to be a product for everyone. This
post contains a chart showing how positioning differs for Microsoft,
Discord, and Slack based on their audiences.

 HOW TO USE GAP ANALYSIS TO GAIN AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER YOUR
COMPETITORS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 If you can satisfy twice as many of your site visitors‚Äô intentions,
you effectively halve the cost of acquiring a customer. Performing a
gap analysis enables you to find out what your visitors want that you
don‚Äôt offer. First, use an on-page survey to ask visitors why they
visited your website. Categorize the responses based on visitors‚Äô
intentions, the percentage of all visits, and whether or not your
brand satisfies the intention. Finally, identify how your brand could
monetize each unmet intention and the revenue opportunity from doing
so.

promotions, and product discovery. The key to the successful
integration of AI lies in hyper-personalized recommendations and
creating a frictionless shopping experience.
