NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW BELI ATE YELP (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Beli, launched in 2021, is quickly becoming Gen Z's restaurant app of
choice as they dine out more often than any other age group and want a
better way to track meals. About 80% of users are under 35, and
they've logged more than 75M ratings worldwide, nearly rivaling Yelp's
totals. Designed like a social network, Beli lets diners score meals,
create lists, and plan outings, making it the go-to tool for a
generation treating restaurants as a core part of their social lives. 

 77% OF SITES LOST KEYWORD VISIBILITY AFTER GOOGLE REMOVED NUM=100:
DATA (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's removal of the num=100 parameter has caused widespread drops
in reported impressions, rankings, and keyword visibility. An analysis
of 319 sites showed 87.7% saw fewer impressions and 77.6% lost unique
ranking terms in Google Search Console. Short-tail and mid-tail
keywords were hit the hardest. While reports now look weaker, the
‘lost' keyword visibility may largely be scraper traffic that relied
on the num=100 parameter.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW A VIRAL GEN Z HOODIE BRAND IS MAXIMIZING SIGNAGE ON A POP-UP TOUR
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Dandy, a viral Gen Z hoodie brand, created a touring pop-up designed
for social sharing. Locations were scouted with Google Earth and
modeled in 3D to ensure every angle was camera-ready. Materials
allowed for durability and quick touchups, while details like vintage
gas pumps, branded shelves, and prize lockers encouraged engagement.
The goal was to connect with superfans and generate organic content
over short-term sales. 

 THE INTENTION-ACTION GAP (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Consumers often say they want sustainable products but rarely buy
them, creating the intention-action gap. A 2020 laundry project closed
this gap by removing barriers, using familiar packaging, securing
prime shelf placement, and building demand before launch. The focus
wasn't convincing people what they should want, but making what they
already want easier to choose and better for the planet. 

 HOW B2B BUYERS CHOOSE WHICH PROBLEM TO FIX (AND HOW TO MAKE YOURS THE
PRIORITY) (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 B2B buyers prioritize problems by importance and urgency. To make a
service a priority, companies should frame it around issues with
emotional weight, such as reputation or leadership perception.
Messaging should highlight personal, high-stakes problems over
operational inconveniences and build urgency by showing daily symptoms
through repeated messaging, prompting buyers to act.

 3 WAYS TO USE PHOTO-TO-VIDEO IN GEMINI (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The top three uses for photo-to-video in Gemini are animating
illustrations for internal and external content, turning brand photos
into mini-movies, and simulating complex creative visions with
detailed scene prompts. It can be used to mock up new brand visuals or
simulate specific user scenarios. Each generated video includes
ambient audio, and results improve with tighter subjects and more
specific prompts. 

 THE COMPLETE MATCH TYPE PERFORMANCE STUDY: THE BEST MATCH TYPES BY
BID METHOD (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Exact match delivers the best efficiency with higher ROAS and lower
CPAs across bidding methods. Broad match supports revenue-driven
strategies, especially with Max Conversion Value bidding. Phrase match
underperforms in low-data accounts but improves with Target ROAS or
Target CPA as Google gains data. Smaller advertisers should start with
Exact and expand to Broad, while larger advertisers can layer in
Phrase and then Broad based on budget. Exact match should remain the
foundation, with adjustments by bid method and account size.

 THE HIDDEN 4TH P: HOW PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS TRANSFORMS MARKETING'S
MOST OVERLOOKED ELEMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Predictive analytics is turning ‘placement' into a strategic
marketing advantage by optimizing inventory decisions based on
real-time data signals. Retailers are using predictive analytics to
forecast exactly what products to stock, where, and when by combining
data sources like economic indicators, seasonal trends, and real-time
cultural shifts. Walmart's systems predict storm-driven demand spikes
down to the product level, while Kroger monetizes its massive customer
dataset by licensing forecasting models to smaller chains. These tools
prevent costly overstock or stockouts and align inventory with
marketing campaigns. 

 FOR SPORTS FANS WHO KNOW EVERYTHING (5 MINUTE READ) [12]

intrigue. He uses targeted language, ego appeals, and curiosities that
spark interest without challenging the reader. The structure guides
attention with headlines, bullet points, and clear formatting. The ad
demonstrates that focusing on a specific audience, appealing to pride,
and presenting proof in engaging ways can drive conversions even among
tough customers.
