NEWS & TRENDS

 AUDIO ADS BEAT YOUTUBE VIDEO ADS IN EFFECTIVENESS (6 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Audio podcast ads drive 18-25% more purchases than YouTube podcast
views. Listeners seek out content intentionally and form stronger
connections with hosts. Meanwhile, YouTube audiences are often passive
or multitasking. Audio-first formats create a more intimate and
persuasive experience. Studies show consumers respond with stronger
physiological engagement, including higher heart rate and skin
response compared with video. 

 LINKEDIN JOBS ON THE RISE 2026: THE 25 FASTEST-GROWING ROLES IN THE
US (16 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 US job growth is being driven by AI and advisory roles. More than 56%
of professionals plan to job hunt this year, while 76% say they feel
unprepared. The list shows strong growth in founders and independent
consultants, which shows a shift toward self-employment. Sales and
marketing also show up on the list in several places. The rankings are
based on LinkedIn data from January 1, 2023, to July 31, 2025, and
include insights on skills, locations, experience, and flexible work.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHEN TO SHOW VS HIDE PRICES (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Delaying price disclosure increases purchases for premium products
but reduces purchases for affordable or discounted items. Across 6
experiments, people were 21.1% more likely to buy an expensive
espresso machine when the price appeared after adding it to the cart.
People were 18.1% less likely to want a 30% off espresso machine when
the sale price appeared after a click. People were 11.4% less likely
to buy from a daily deal email when prices were hidden. 

 WHY YOUR FIRST 200 WORDS ARE CRUCIAL FOR AI SEARCH OPTIMIZATION (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI search systems now prioritize the first 200 words as the main
source of context and credibility. Engines such as Google's AI
Overviews and ChatGPT use the opening paragraph to define topic
relevance, author authority, and audience fit. Pages that open with
clear entities and purpose are 38% more likely to be cited. Effective
introductions state the subject and identify the source, enabling
accurate classification and reuse in generative search results.

DIDN'T WANT WEBSITES SCRAPED (3 MINUTE READ) [13]

consent. Some businesses received orders for items they didn't sell or
that were out of stock. Over 180 retailers on platforms like Shopify

without permission. Amazon says businesses can opt out and that the
tools drive incremental sales.
