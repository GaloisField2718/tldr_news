 EPIC CEO TIM SWEENEY ON WHY THE COMPANY DID BETTER AGAINST GOOGLE
THAN APPLE IN COURT (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Epic Games has won its court case against Google's Android app store.
A jury found Google held a monopoly power and used anti-competitive
practices that hurt consumers and developers. The outcome is starkly
different from the case against Apple. Epic had documentation that
showed that Google was locking up the app store market through deals
with handset makers. It called out revenue-sharing deals and showed
how Google scared users away from sideloading apps.

 INCREASE EMAIL CONFIRMATION RATE WITH SNIPER LINKS (2 MINUTE READ)
[7]

the signup process and prevents emails from getting lost in the spam
folder.

 NO, X.99 PRICES DON‚ÄôT HURT QUALITY PERCEPTIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Just-below prices (e.g. $15.99 rather than $16) are effective at
making a price look significantly cheaper even though it‚Äôs not. New
analysis has debunked the belief that this tactic makes the products
seem lower quality. Just-below pricing (e.g. $79) has the strongest
impact on purchase intent when it‚Äôs compared to a rounded price
(e.g. $80). 

 MAXBONE: A MARKETING AUDIT (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Maxbone is a DTC pet accessory and clothing brand. It succeeds with
paid social due to its lifestyle UGC content and social proof
callouts. However, the brand could add more variety to its creative.
In paid search, Maxbone covers the basics but misses out on demand
capture due to the lack of shopping listings. The company‚Äôs website
is effective in showing customer reviews and displaying a prominent
sale banner on every page, but its subscription page lacks education
and customization.
