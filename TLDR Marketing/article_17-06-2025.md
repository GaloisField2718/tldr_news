 MALE INFLUENCE: HOW YOUNG MEN FEEL ABOUT THE ROLE OF ONLINE MALE
INFLUENCES IN THEIR LIVES AND COMMUNITIES (21 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This report looks at how young men engage with social media
influencers and the impact on their views and mental health. Only 25%
trust what they see on social media, yet 43% trust the influencers
they follow. Nearly half believe social media gives them a negative
view of the world, and 70% want to see more content from positive male
role models. Over half say depictions of men online feel unrealistic,
and 24% have switched the platform they primarily use in search of a
healthier, more positive social media experience. 

 WHY AI MAKES THE CASE FOR FRACTIONAL CMOS STRONGER THAN EVER (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 As AI eliminates traditional marketing bottlenecks, the demand grows
for leaders who can translate automation into strategic growth.
Fractional CMOs, who are more focused on oversight rather than
execution, bring scalable expertise and objectivity that full-time
roles often lack. Their value comes from their ability to align AI
with human insight to create faster, more intelligent brand-building
systems.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 7 MARKETING LESSONS HIDING IN NEWS & POP CULTURE HEADLINES (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Effective marketing taps into overlooked problems and clear
positioning. Dyson succeeded by solving real, everyday challenges like
hair styling, while Skechers grew by focusing on comfort for people on
their feet all day. Rebrands only work when they clarify confusion,
not just change logos. HBO dropping “Max” succeeded by leaning
into recognition, while KIND's update faltered without a clear story.
AI-first positioning often backfires unless directly tied to customer
benefits, as Duolingo learned. Nostalgia works when paired with real
value, like Red Lobster's $19.99 shrimp deal featuring Joey Fatone. 

 COMMENTS VS. COMMUNITY. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While ‘comments' involve brands engaging in conversations on social
media, whether by replying to customer posts or joining comment
threads on viral content, ‘community' building goes much deeper.
Comments do increase visibility, show brand personality, and create
casual interactions, but they are only one part of a broader strategy.
True community building focuses on creating lasting connections,
offering shared spaces, and providing ongoing value that goes beyond
reactive engagement. Relying only on comments can lead to shallow
interactions and comment fatigue. Building a real community requires
an effort that involves more than just the social team.

 WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN SEARCH IN 2025 AND BEYOND (WEBINAR) [8] 

 Ranking #1 no longer guarantees website traffic, and traditional SEO
that targets keywords is becoming less effective. Many users now get
answers directly from AI tools, skipping websites altogether. A new
search strategy emphasizes influence-based metrics such as share of
voice, citation visibility, and overall reach across platforms. This
free 30-minute-long webinar will take place on June 18. 

 PAYPAL DEBUTS SHOPPABLE ADS FOR PUBLISHER SITES (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 PayPal's Storefront Ads is a shoppable ad format that lets consumers
browse and purchase products directly within publisher sites and apps
without being redirected. The ads use PayPal's shopping data and
payment tools to enable seamless checkout via PayPal or Venmo.
Business Insider, Vox Media, and Horizon Media are early partners. A
US rollout is planned for later this summer. 

 ADS ARE “ROLLING OUT GRADUALLY” TO WHATSAPP (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 WhatsApp is introducing ads for the first time, placing them within
the Updates tab where 1.5B users engage daily with statuses and
channels. The new formats include sponsored status updates, promoted
channels, and paid subscriptions, allowing businesses to reach users
without interrupting private chats.

 WHY WE GET HOOKED: THE INVISIBLE THREADS BEHIND PRODUCT LOYALTY (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Product loyalty often forms through emotional connections rather than
superior features or design. A product may stick because it solves a
problem reliably, feels familiar, or enters a user's life at the right
moment. Loyalty also grows through early adoption, trusted
recommendations, or the effort it would take to switch. Over time, the
product becomes part of the user's story, making it feel personal and
hard to replace. 

 YOUTUBE OFFERS EXPANDED MONETIZATION AVENUES FOR EDUCATIONAL CONTENT
(2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 YouTube's Player for Education program allows creators to earn
revenue when their educational content is embedded in school
materials. Even though the videos run without ads, creators are paid
based on watch time through licensing fees from educational partners.
A new section in the YouTube Studio app lets creators track earnings
from these placements.
