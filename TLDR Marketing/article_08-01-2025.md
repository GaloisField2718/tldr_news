 MORE SPEECH AND FEWER MISTAKES (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Meta, aiming to balance free speech with fair content moderation, is
replacing its US third-party fact-checking program with a Community
Notes model. Restrictions on political and societal discourse are
being eased, focusing enforcement on illegal and high-severity
violations. Automated systems will be refined to reduce
over-censorship, while appeals and account recovery processes are
streamlined. A personalized approach to political content will let
users adjust how much they see in their feeds.

Studio.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE GREAT SEO HEIST: HOW I TURNED ONE BLOG POST INTO $250K (7 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A blog post generated $250,000 in direct attributable revenue by
targeting a high-value keyword driving significant traffic to a
competitor 10 times larger. Its success was built on six months of
meticulous planning and deep research and by crafting a comprehensive,
actionable guide that outclassed existing content. Strategic affiliate
deals and partnerships turned the high-intent traffic into a long-term
revenue stream. 

 HOW TO GET BETTER CUSTOMER INSIGHTS USING AI (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Generative AI, when combined with human oversight, significantly
improves market research by enabling deeper insights, faster
execution, and broader data collection. A research study found that AI
can simulate customer personas, conduct detailed interviews, and group
findings into themes, outperforming humans in areas like depth
(0.680-point increase) and insight scores (0.498-point increase).
However, AI requires human guidance to fill gaps in depth and ensure
varied responses. While tools like ChatGPT and Quantilope streamline
tasks, limitations include occasional errors, Western-centric
findings, and data consistency issues. 

 HOW TO PRODUCE THOUGHT LEADERSHIP CONTENT IN 1 DAY (1 MINUTE READ)

prompts for varied formats like Q&A and deep dives. Record extensively
to fuel long-term content creation. Repurpose the material into posts,
blogs, videos, and photos, spreading it across a 10+ week content
calendar.

 A NEW STUDY EXPOSES A HIDDEN FLAW IN A-B TESTING ON DIGITAL AD
PLATFORMS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A new study shows that A-B testing on platforms like Meta and Google
may produce misleading results due to "divergent delivery", where
targeting algorithms assign different ads to distinct user groups.
These algorithms optimize ad targeting based on relevance to users,
meaning the “winning” ad may perform better simply because it was
shown to users more likely to engage, rather than due to superior
creative content. This inherent flaw in the testing process
compromises marketers' ability to draw accurate conclusions about ad
effectiveness.
