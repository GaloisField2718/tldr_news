NEWS & TRENDS

 EARLY AI SIGNALS FROM HOLIDAY SALES (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Direct AI-driven ecommerce traffic remained small despite fast growth
last year. US online holiday sales hit $257.8B, up 6.8%. Salesforce
estimated that AI influenced 20% of Christmas retail spending. Adobe
reported a 693% jump in AI-driven traffic, but the gains came from
small baselines, and it did not share AI's share of total traffic or
revenue. Most AI referrals came from desktop at 73% and concentrated
in research-heavy categories like electronics and appliances. AI is
affecting consideration more than clicks or final purchases. 

 HOW RISING RETAIL BRANDS USE INFLUENCERS TO COMBAT DIGITAL OVERLOAD
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Rising retail brands are leaning on influencers and everyday creators
to cut through digital fatigue. They're using community-driven content
to amplify organic moments. Authentic creator networks help brands
capitalize on unexpected virality and reach consumers who are weary of
traditional ads. Beyond Yoga and Mejuri now treat community as a core
function. They're tapping niche creators and turning strong organic
posts into paid media. Demand for human-centered creators is growing.

 EVERYTHING IS TV AND NOTHING IS TV (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Consumer AI is evolving toward TV as digital behavior shifts to
video. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and podcasts are dominated by
passive viewing. As generative media improves, AI products will
resemble TV through personalized and endless shows. At the same time,
AI will drive major cost declines across industries by automating
labor and turning services into software, similar to how TV prices
fell 98% since 2000. These efficiency gains follow Jevons' Paradox,
where lower costs raise demand and expand markets rather than replace
them. 

 WHAT THE PERPLEXITY-AMAZON LAWSUIT COULD MEAN FOR DIGITAL ADVERTISING
(3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Amazon's lawsuit against Perplexity AI centers on whether agentic
shopping tools undermine ad-supported commerce by bypassing promotions
and brand-controlled experiences. Amazon claims Perplexity's Comet
agent poses security risks and disguises automated activity as human
behavior. Perplexity argues the real issue is lost advertising
exposure when AI agents shop instead of people. If agents transact
without seeing ads, retailers risk losing both media revenue and
direct customer relationships.
