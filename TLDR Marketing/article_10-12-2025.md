NEWS & TRENDS

 INTERNAL COMMS TRENDS REPORT (28 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Internal comms teams are entering the new year with stronger
foundations and clearer priorities. However, most still feel stretched
as expectations outpace resources. Email remains the most reliable and
effective channel, measurement continues to lag, and intranets are
both the biggest challenge and top improvement priority. Manager
communication remains the leading trend, AI is now part of daily
workflows, and automation is the next big focus. Teams plan to elevate
employee voices, strengthen channel ecosystems, and invest in tools
that improve efficiency. 

 UBER'S LATEST PLAY FOR AD DOLLARS: TURNING DATA ABOUT YOUR TRIPS AND
TAKEOUT INTO INSIGHTS FOR MARKETERS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Uber Intelligence tool helps brands combine their own customer
data with Uber's location and delivery insights using privacy-safe
clean room tech. This unlocks targeting options for behaviors like
business travel or dining habits. With in-app placements, in-car
screens, and loyalty integrations, Uber is positioning itself as a
retail media network built on movement data. Companies can now tap
into this “terrestrial data” to create contextual ad experiences
and explore non-traditional partnerships, like hospitality or CPG,
that align with users' real-world journeys.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FREE EXPERIENCES > FREE PRODUCTS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Experiential rewards drive significantly higher engagement and
spending than physical items. Customers were up to 4x more likely to
choose an experience, spent 43.3% more before the reward, and spent
63.7% more after redeeming it. Framing items as experiences increased
repeat purchase intent by 8% and boosted positive word of mouth by
9.2%. Group-based activities also increased reward redemption
likelihood by up to 21%. 

 THE TOP 10 CONTENT MARKETING MISTAKES I SEE OVER AND OVER (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Many content programs fail not from effort but from misaligned focus.
Common mistakes include undifferentiated content, overemphasis on
top-of-funnel posts, weak thought leadership, poor LinkedIn and
executive presence, and case studies that don't show real results.
Teams also underuse repurposing, try to address all buyers, spread
across too many topics, and lack the right strategy or expertise to
integrate SEO, social, and messaging. To fix this, audit your content,
address the biggest gaps first, and consider fractional strategists or
specialists to build a program that drives leads, authority, and
measurable results. 

 HOW ONE RETAILER USED AI TO TURN ‘OUT-OF-STOCK' INTO IN-STORE
TRAFFIC (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Salvation Army turned sold-out items into a successful campaign
by using AI to create urgency. Instead of promoting available
products, the ads featured recently sold pieces, triggering FOMO. With
Gemini and Nano Banana, raw inventory images became high-end editorial
visuals in just 30 days. The campaign lowered cost per store visit by
138% and delivered a 2.6X higher CTR than Google benchmarks.

 HOW TO CREATE SEO IMAGES AT SCALE WITH SCREAMING FROG + NANO BANANA
PRO (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A tutorial for creating high-quality images at scale by combining
Screaming Frog with the Nano Banana Pro model through the Gemini 3
API. The process uses Screaming Frog as an easy access point for the
“Gemini 3 pro image preview” model, which can generate accurate
vector illustrations that match page titles. Limiting crawl speed to 2
to 3 URLs per second improves consistency, and exports provide all
generated assets in one file. More specific prompts lead to stronger
outputs and can outperform existing site images.

 THE RISE OF THE HYPERTAIL: HOW CUSTOM MARTECH IS REWRITING GTM (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Modern GTM is shifting from buying tools to creating custom internal
systems that power growth. AI and low code now let teams build bespoke
workflows and micro automations that sit beneath the visible stack and
create differentiation that competitors cannot copy. This hypertail of
custom logic is turning CMOs into system architects who must manage
complexity, govern internal workflows, and decide where custom design
drives advantage. Startups gain most by using fewer tools more deeply
and extending them with purpose-built logic that improves activation
and retention. The companies that win will focus on smart workflows
and intentional AI rather than tool count. 

 WHAT IS FEAR MARKETING AND HOW TO USE IT ETHICALLY (15 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Used responsibly, fear-based messaging can move audiences from
indecision to action by surfacing existing concerns and offering
immediate solutions. Examples range from pet insurance companies using
real customer stories to cybersecurity firms offering fast resolutions
to common threats. The tactic succeeds when tied to credible fears and
clear next steps. Exaggeration, manipulation, and vague threats reduce
trust and invite legal risk. Executing this approach well means
listening closely to your audience, respecting their concerns, and
delivering relief through simple, believable solutions.
