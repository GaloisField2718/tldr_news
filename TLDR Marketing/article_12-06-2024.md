NEWS & TRENDS

MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple announced that its Messages app will support Rich Communication
Services (RCS) in iOS 18. The new standard will replace SMS as the
default communication protocol between Android and iOS devices. RCS
allows marketers to create more engaging customer experiences,
including personalized messages and videos, location-based
suggestions, and dynamic carousels. 

 MARKETERS ‚ÄòOVERESTIMATE' CHANCES OF ACHIEVING BRAND LOYALTY (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Emotional brand loyalty is often confused with habitual behavior. A
new study reveals that marketers overestimate brand loyalty, with only
13% of consumers identifying as true brand fans. Instead, speed, ease,
and habit are the primary drivers of repeat purchases, with 97% citing
these factors. Neurobiological principles like reward, memory,
emotion, and social interaction influence loyalty. Effective tactics
include gamification, shared values, and personalization.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ON WRITING A TAGLINE AND PITCHING IT (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Taglines are long-term branding tools, while slogans support specific
campaigns. A tagline isn't complete until it's clear, easy to
understand, and resonates with others. Start with a brand's unique
selling proposition or positioning statement and edit for brevity and
clarity. Generate numerous options, refine them rigorously, and
‚Äúkill your darlings‚Äù to ensure the best work is presented. 

 FIVE GOLDEN QUESTIONS THAT REVEAL EXACTLY WHY YOUR VISITORS AREN'T
CONVERTING (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To increase a website's conversion rate, survey customers who just
bought your product or service. These users can help uncover obstacles
that result in other visitors leaving without buying. Ask them where
exactly they first found out about you, what persuaded them to
purchase from you, which options they considered before choosing your
product, and the one thing that nearly stopped them buying from you.
Incentivize survey participation with a small reward and send a thank
you email to respondents.

 B2B SAAS REBRANDING 101: HOW TO GET IT RIGHT (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A rebrand might be necessary if the current messaging isn't
effectively communicating a company's mission and values. This could
involve overhauling the entire marketing strategy and public image and
include a new name, logo, design style, or tone of voice. Brand
refreshes update the existing brand strategy without completely
changing the brand's identity. Rebranding should be avoided if the
company is still new or driven by a need to keep up with competitors.
