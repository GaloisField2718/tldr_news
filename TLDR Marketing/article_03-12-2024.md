 THE STATE OF AGILE MARKETING: WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Marketing teams need to deliver for many different stakeholders and
initiatives across the business, while also managing and pursuing
their own agenda. How do you walk this tightrope? Agile marketing
practices might be the answer to boosting productivity,
prioritization, and quality.

In this recorded session hosted by Atlassian [4], modern work coach
Marc Cruth and Andrea Fryrear of AgileSherpas review key findings from
the 7th annual State of Agile Marketing report [4], and share examples

 HOW AI IS ACCELERATING—AND DEVALUING—BOOK PUBLISHING (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 AI is reshaping publishing by enabling rapid production and
distribution. Players like Spines are targeting 8,000 titles annually,
which is 4X the output of legacy publishers like Simon & Schuster. AI
is expanding access to foreign-language books and accelerating
processes, but it is also flooding markets with low-quality,
AI-generated content. Traditional publishers are wary of IP issues and
market dilution.

TECH IS BETTER THAN NOTHING (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Australia's social media ban for teens is flawed because it may not
effectively prevent harm and could push teens to unregulated spaces.
Blanket age bans ignore adolescents' varying maturity levels and fail
to address deeper issues, such as the need for better digital
safeguards. While the law forces important conversations about youth
protection online, it comes with a lack of comprehensive solutions.
