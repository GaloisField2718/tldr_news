NEWS & TRENDS

 THE STATE OF DIGITAL TRUST IN 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Consumers are becoming more privacy-aware and are taking control over
their data. 42% read cookie banners often, and 46% clicked "accept
all" less than they did three years ago. Trust in brands now depends
on transparency, with 44% of consumers saying clear data use is the
top reason they trust a brand. Privacy-Led Marketing has become a
strategic necessity, turning privacy from a legal checkbox into a
competitive advantage. Brands that embed transparency and education
into every touchpoint can build deeper trust and reduce friction. 

 ‘YOU CAN'T PAUSE THE INTERNET': SOCIAL MEDIA CREATORS HIT BY
BURNOUT (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Many social media creators face severe burnout due to constant online
pressure, lack of structure, and absence of traditional workplace
support. In a survey of 1,000 US and UK creators, half reported
experiencing burnout, and 37% considered quitting. Melanie Murphy, a
creator with 800K followers, reduced her workload and income by $20K
after a breakdown in order to prioritize her mental health. The
industry demands creators juggle content creation, brand
relationships, and self-promotion, all while monetizing their personal
lives, which many say takes a lasting emotional toll.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BUILDING AN AI-ENABLED MARKETING TEAM (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Startups can now run marketing operations with as few as 5 people by
combining a lean human team with AI tools. A traditional 30-person
team at Postmates costs $2.5M annually. However, a modern AI-enabled
team of 8 can achieve similar output for about $700K, a 72% reduction.
The new structure includes one marketing lead, one or two offshore
executors, and AI tools for tasks. Companies that adopt this model
early could gain an 18-month competitive edge. 

 FROM 0 TO $11K MRR: HOW JACK FRIKS BUILT POST BRIDGE (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Jack Friks built Post Bridge to solve his own problem of posting
content across multiple platforms. This turned into a business earning
$11K in monthly recurring revenue. Instead of competing on complex
features, Post Bridge focused on simplicity, speed, and low pricing,
with plans starting at $9. It targeted solo creators rather than
teams, offering only the features needed to get the job done. Friks'
social media presence helped grow the tool organically by resonating
with creators facing the same struggles.

 5 AMAZON ADS FEATURES YOU'RE NOT USING—BUT SHOULD BE (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Non-endemic ads let non-retail brands target Amazon's vast audience
using first-party data. Amazon Retail Ad Service centralizes campaign
management across retailers but still lacks scale. Amazon Attribution
tracks how external channels drive Amazon sales. Social commerce is
growing around Prime Day, with influencer content on TikTok and Meta
driving traffic to Amazon. Prime Video and Live Sports offer ad space
with diverse audiences, giving brands more ways to reach customers
through streaming and live events.

 F1 THE BUSINESS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 F1 has transformed its brand by embracing Hollywood and streaming.
Its partnership with Netflix's Drive to Survive has doubled US
viewership and grown its global fanbase to 827M. 1 in 4 fans cited the
show as a major reason they follow the sport. Apple's new F1 movie
continues this strategy with real race footage and star cameos. F1 is
now positioned as a global brand engine, appealing to younger
audiences and attracting streaming platforms competing for upcoming US
media rights. 

 THE 7 TRAITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE SEO LEADERS (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Good SEO leaders solve user problems instead of just ranking for
keywords. They align efforts across the entire user journey, build
scalable systems, and treat SEO as a product with continuous
improvements. They tie SEO efforts to revenue and business growth and
work closely with product, engineering, and content teams. Their goal
is to improve customer retention and reduce churn, positioning SEO as
a key driver of business success, not just a marketing tactic.
