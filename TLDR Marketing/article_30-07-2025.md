 WE ARE SOCIAL: DIGITAL 2025 JULY GLOBAL STATSHOT REPORT (27 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Search traffic is declining, but search engines are still the top
method for discovering new brands, with one in three online adults
introduced to brands through search. The share of users citing search
as their primary discovery method has grown by 2.5 percentage points
over two years, representing over 100 million more shoppers. Google's
traffic has dropped by 4% over the past three years, now at 19 billion
visits per week, and it is referring hundreds of millions fewer
visitors to third-party sites. Despite these shifts and the rise of AI
tools like ChatGPT, which has 500 million monthly users, marketers
should not overhaul their search strategies yet.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW ADVERTISERS ARE APPROACHING ADS ON WHATSAPP (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Advertisers are navigating WhatsApp's limited targeting by
prioritizing creative messaging and contextual factors like time of
day or device type. While user privacy concerns remain high, brands in
retail, tech, and telecom are testing the waters. Early ad formats
include low-cost Status ads and AI-powered agents for personalized
engagement. 

 LOW-PRICED PRODUCTS SEEM LESS SUSTAINABLE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Consumers perceive higher priced sustainable products as more
eco-friendly, regardless of actual quality. In experiments, lower
priced sustainable backpacks were seen as 8.35% less eco-friendly than
higher priced ones, and a more expensive detergent was seen as 6.1%
more sustainable. This bias stems from the belief that sustainability
increases production costs, so low prices trigger skepticism. The
effect weakens if companies clearly explain how they keep prices low
through methods like automation or bulk buying. 

 HOW TO FUTURE-PROOF YOUR EMAIL MARKETING WITH BIMI, AMP, AND AI (12
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Email open rates rose 6% and click-to-conversion rates jumped 27.6%
in 2024, showing email remains a high-performing channel despite
privacy and security challenges. BIMI implementation can increase
consumer confidence by 90% while interactive AMP features and AI
optimization improve in-email actions and revenue per recipient. These
innovations leverage first-party data to maintain deliverability and
engagement as tracking cookies disappear.

 SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING ETHICS IN THE AGE OF AI (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI is now deeply embedded in social media marketing, helping brands
generate content, analyze trends, and automate interactions, but
raising ethical concerns around transparency, privacy, and trust.
Consumers are increasingly aware, with 41% most likely to call out
unethical behavior over anything else, and regulators are responding
with stricter disclosure requirements for both ads and AI-generated
content. Brands must build trust by being open about data use and AI
involvement, protecting privacy, and ensuring inclusive, respectful
content. Transparency boosts credibility, as shown by a 2024 study
where disclosing AI use in ads increased trust by 96%. Without clear
ethical guardrails, brands risk losing customers, talent, and investor
confidence.
