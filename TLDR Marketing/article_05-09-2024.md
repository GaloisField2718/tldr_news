 Digital advertising grew 16.4% in Q2, nearly double last year's rate,

declining momentum in retail media networks and reduced demand from

 A TEMPLATE TO HELP YOU DESIGN UNBEATABLE MULTI-STEP CONVERSION
FUNNELS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The CRE Funnel Planner is a framework that makes it easier to design
a multi-step marketing funnel for your brand. It allows you to plan
activities at each stage that incentivize users to continue. The
framework involves identifying the goals of the user, the goals of
your brand, and the series of actions that result in a conversion. 

 ANALYZING GOOGLE AI OVERVIEW RANKINGS AT SCALE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Semrush's newly-released Google AI Overview (AIO) reporting, designed
to make AIO tracking far more accessible, is the first of its kind.
Google Search Console offers valuable first-party AIO reporting, but
it lacks filtering, which limits how much can be analyzed. An initial
analysis of AIOs within the Semrush tool found that AIO placements are
unlikely without a top 10 ranking (similar to Featured Snippets).
Additionally, only 0.1% of Wikipedia's ranked keywords include an AIO,
compared to 0.23% for Reddit.

MINUTE READ) [15] 

 ‚ÄúSponsored Snaps‚Äù from brands will appear as unread messages in
Snapchat's main Chat tab, sitting above messages from a person's
contacts until they're acted on. This is the first time Snap will show
ads in the most-used part of its app. The app will also start letting
advertisers pay to promote places in its Map tab, where Snapchat users
can see the whereabouts of their friends.
