NEWS & TRENDS

 FROM SEARCH TO SOCIAL: INSIDE THE BILLIONS SHIFTING TO SOCIAL-FIRST
MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Unilever's decision to shift half its media budget to social reflects
a broader trend, with 80% of marketers reallocating funds from
traditional channels. Social media has become the core of discovery,
engagement, and purchasing, with ad spend projected to hit $406
billion globally by 2029. The 2025 Impact of Social Media Marketing
Report found that 87% of leaders plan to increase paid social
spending, and over 80% expect to increase influencer and organic
social investment. Brands like Wild, Duolingo, Lowe's, and Marks &
Spencer show how social-first strategies can drive measurable sales
growth, especially with Gen Z and Millennial audiences. 

 MOST DEVS BELIEVE AI IS GOING TO KILL 'MOST OR ALL' OF THEIR
COMPANY'S MARKETING DEPARTMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Developers overwhelmingly see AI as capable of replacing large parts
of marketing, with nearly 75% saying it could do most or all of the
work. In contrast, far fewer marketers believe they could replicate
developers' jobs, highlighting a confidence gap between the two
fields. The findings reflect developers' deep integration of AI in
their daily work, where 90% already depend on it for efficiency and
problem-solving.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SHOPPERS SEEK FEATURES, NOT OUTCOMES, ON LLM (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 LLMs are changing homepage writing by shifting focus to specific
features over broad outcomes and reducing the influence of brand
recognition for smaller buyers. Users search for precise
functionality, so products must clearly list features for LLMs to
recommend them. While large enterprises still favor well-known brands,
smaller businesses and consumers increasingly choose products that
match their exact needs, even from lesser-known companies. 

 HOW BRANDS CAN WIN BIG WITH INCLUSION STRATEGY (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Inclusive branding is proving to be a commercial growth driver, with
one study showing short-term sales gains of 3.5%, long-term growth of
16.5%, and loyalty increases of 15% when brands adopt inclusive
advertising. Mattel's Barbie is a strong example, seeing a 63% revenue
jump between 2015 and 2022 after shifting toward inclusivity, while
Bud Light serves as a cautionary example for alienating a core base by
misjudging identity tensions. To succeed, brands should conduct an
identity audit of their customers and brand DNA, run incremental tests
to refine messaging and stakeholder alignment, and fully integrate
inclusivity into governance, partnerships, and company culture.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 AI SEARCH RANK TRACKERS ARE LYING TO YOU (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most AI search visibility tools overpromise because they rely on
synthetic prompts and lack access to real user data. Reliable tracking
is difficult due to query variance, personalization, model
differences, and changing outputs, making accurate measurement of
AI-driven search visibility nearly impossible. AI is still in its
early stages, so it's important to understand each tool's data sources
and limitations before trusting their reports. 

 LINKEDIN ADDS MORE POST-LEVEL ANALYTICS UPDATES (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 LinkedIn users will now get notifications at key intervals, such as 3
and 7 days after posting, showing how their content drives
impressions, profile views, and follower growth. The updates,
delivered directly in notifications, build on LinkedIn's May analytics
refresh and support its broader push to attract creators with better
insights and monetization options. Users can manage notification
frequency to avoid overload.

 AMAZON'S EXIT FROM GOOGLE ADS TRIGGERED A TRAFFIC SURGE — BUT ROI
DIDN'T FOLLOW (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Amazon's sudden exit from Google Shopping ads in July caused
immediate disruption across ad auctions, leading to more clicks and
impressions but weaker returns for most advertisers. Overall clicks
rose 7.8% and CPCs fell 8.3%, but conversion value declined 5.5% and
ROAS dropped 4.4%, showing that extra traffic often failed to
translate into profitable sales. Electronics was the only major
category to see true gains, with conversions up 81.3% and ROAS up
7.1%, as brands like Best Buy and Apple could match Amazon's speed and
pricing. Most other sectors, including Apparel & Accessories and
Sporting Goods, fell into the “volume trap,” gaining traffic but
losing efficiency as Amazon-seeking shoppers expected unmatched price
and convenience. Advertisers must track value, not just volume, and
focus on sustainable advantages rather than chasing displaced Amazon
traffic. 

 SCALING CONTENT AT DROPBOX WITH AI AND TASTE (34 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Dropbox content team replaced the traditional waterfall method of
large sequential campaigns with a more agile structure that allows
faster pivots and continuous learning. The team was organized into
four pods that focus on quick-turn experiments, explanatory content,
customer stories, and thought leadership, all supported by real-time
data and reporting. By connecting an automated content calendar to
workflows and KPIs, the group tripled production for Dropbox Sign
without increasing budget, while agency partners and AI tools provided
overflow capacity to prevent burnout and maintain quality. 

 STUPIDEST MARKETING MOVE + HOW TO WIN ON SOCIAL WITH GARY VEE (34
MINUTE PODCAST) [14] 

 Gary Vaynerchuk recommends identifying content that performs well
organically, tweaking it slightly, and amplifying it to drive sales or
registrations. He advises giving value first through the “jab, jab,
jab, right hook” approach, where giving builds brand and credibility
before asking. Interest should focus on niche passions over follower
count, guided by the PAC framework of platforms, algorithms, and
culture. Spotting micro-trends that can evolve into long-term cultural
movements and avoiding last-touch attribution helps preserve brand
impact.
