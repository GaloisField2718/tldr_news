 HOW DO WE ANCHOR CONTENT MARKETING EFFORTS IN A MULTI-PLATFORM
DISTRIBUTION WORLD? (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Content marketers are advised to focus on reach and resonance.
Instead of relying solely on SEO or a single platform, marketers
should deliver the right message where their audience is most active.
Use formats like product news and data journalism to engage audiences
and create emotional connections. Content efforts may not always be
trackable but are still valuable in building brand awareness. Success
requires consistent experimentation, making people feel seen, and
being willing to embrace failures. 

 WHY DO WE OBSESSIVELY WATCH OUR OWN INSTAGRAM STORIES? (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Many of the 2 billion Instagram users are caught in a cycle of
re-watching their own stories, driven by a need for validation and
social approval. Psychologists suggest this behavior stems from our
innate desire to control how we are perceived by others. Social media
platforms amplify this by offering a constant, editable reflection of
ourselves that we feel compelled to perfect.
