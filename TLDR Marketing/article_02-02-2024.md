STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO CREATE INSPIRING PERSONALIZED EMAILS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Personalized emails leverage data to tailor relevant content to
individual subscribers. Countdown timers are a powerful visual tool
for encouraging subscribers to take action while building anticipation
for what‚Äôs to come. Adding products based on weather forecasts is a
good way of including relevant product selections for a subscriber.
Social signals show how many times subscribers have interacted with
something, making it clear to them how popular each product is. This
in turn motivates them to click on the products more. 

 BETTER ROAS FROM SERVER-SIDE TAGGING (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Elverys Sports couldn‚Äôt gather useful data about its Facebook ad
performance because of Safari ITP and browser blockers, resulting in
poor ROAS and minimal insights to improve the ads. The team
implemented server-side tagging using Facebook‚Äôs Conversion API,
which provided more data while staying compliant. This resulted in a
ROAS boost of 52% and enabled the brand to optimize its ads based on
performance. 

 GET BETTER USER TESTING FEEDBACK BY WRITING GOOD SCREENER QUESTIONS
(1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Testers for user testing tools are often looking to take as many
tests as possible to maximize their earnings. When users guess the
answers that get them accepted to take the user test, it means your
test pool isn‚Äôt really your target audience. To prevent this, avoid
using simple 'yes' or 'no' screener questions. Instead, use
multiple-choice questions with a few dummy responses to reject
guessers. You can also include follow-up screener questions to ensure
they haven't just guessed correctly. This post includes an example of
a poorly-written screener and a recommended version to use instead.
