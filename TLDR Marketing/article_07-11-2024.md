 B2B CONTENT MARKETING BENCHMARKS, BUDGETS, AND TRENDS: OUTLOOK FOR
2025 (20 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 58% of marketers rate their content strategies as only "moderately
effective" and 45% struggle to align content with the buyer journey.
Limited resources remains a top challenge for 54% of marketers, while
nearly half face difficulties in measuring content impact and tracking

 REDDIT'S GROWTH PRESENTS NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRANDS (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Reddit's daily active users has surged by 46% in the past year,
reaching 97 million - a growth rate exceeding all other social apps.
This spike, largely fueled by Google referrals, has increased Reddit's
visibility and investor appeal but may indicate a less stable user
base compared to other platforms. While many visitors are transient,
Reddit's potential for brand engagement remains high for niche-focused
communities.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOU "SHOULD" USE THIS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Using words that highlight a gap between a customer's current state
and desired future can boost social media engagement. Language like
"should," "wish," or "want" makes posts 14.9%-20.3% more engaging by
prompting people to imagine a better situation. Assertive words (e.g.,
“Always there for you”) also increase engagement by conveying
confidence. These tactics are most effective when audiences feel they
have less personal control over outcomes. However, they may not apply
universally, especially to physical products or smaller brands. 

 THE GREATEST HITS: REPURPOSING YOUR BEST CONTENT FOR SOCIAL MEDIA (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Brands posted an average of 10 times daily across social networks in
2023, highlighting a demand for consistent content. Repurposing
content saves time, money, and effort for social media teams while
maximizing reach across multiple platforms. Brands should reuse
top-performing content – like blog posts, videos, and reports – in
order to maintain consistent messaging and boost brand visibility. A
strong content repurposing strategy increases a brand's "share of
voice," helping it dominate industry conversations and stay relevant
to target audiences. Tailoring content to each social network enhances
engagement, as user preferences vary by platform. AI tools can further
streamline repurposing by creating multiple fresh versions of
successful content.

 WHY I UNINSTALLED THE SEARCHGPT CHROME EXTENSION: A COMPARISON WITH
GOOGLE AND PERPLEXITY (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 SearchGPT's local search capabilities lag significantly behind
Google's. It delivers irrelevant results for queries about nearby
businesses. It also lacks robust intent recognition, often failing to
interpret searcher intent accurately compared to Google's refined
algorithm. Usage limits and missing search use cases make SearchGPT a
limited tool that is unable to compete as a default search engine
replacement.

 AI SLOP IS FLOODING MEDIUM (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Medium has seen a surge in AI-generated content. Nearly half of
recent posts are estimated as likely AI-driven, especially in topics
like cryptocurrency. CEO Tony Stubblebine has acknowledged the
increase but downplays its impact, saying that most AI content
receives zero views thanks to Medium's spam filters and human
moderation. Stubblebine has dismissed AI detectors as unreliable.
Medium relies on curation to filter low-quality content. 

 JUNE 2024 GOOGLE LINK SPAM UPDATE: WHAT IT REALLY DID TO SITES (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's June 2024 spam update targeted spammy link-building tactics,
leading to traffic drops on many affected sites. Common issues
included irrelevant content, excessive exact match anchor text, and
AI-generated articles, which indicated low-quality or manipulated
links. Many listicles and roundup posts were devalued as they often
relied on purchased or exchanged links, harming sites with traffic
stagnation. Google's new standards discourage link-buying, guest
posts, and forced exchanges in favor of organic, contextually relevant
links. Effective SEO involves producing high-quality informative
content and data-driven reports over traditional link-building
tactics. 

 FATE OF GOOGLE'S SEARCH EMPIRE COULD REST IN TRUMP'S HANDS (5 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 A potential DOJ ruling on Google's breakup is expected in August.
Trump's remarks suggest that he may sway the DOJ against dismantling
the tech giant. His comments hint at concerns that breaking up Google
could weaken the U.S. against China in tech dominance. This shift
marks a surprising turn in Trump's longstanding, often hostile stance
toward Google.
