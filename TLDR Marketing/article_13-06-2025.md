NEWS & TRENDS

 REDDIT RIPPLE EFFECT: CONVERSATIONS DRIVE CONFIDENCE, DECISIONS, AND
PERFORMANCE (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 88% of users turn to Reddit to research purchases. Conversations help
people feel more confident about what they buy. 34% of posts are still
viewed a year later, and 57% of those long-viewed posts mention a
brand or product. Just one organic brand post per week is linked to a
3.5% increase in positive mentions, while 3 comments on user posts can
boost that by another 2.2%. One additional positive user post per week
is associated with a 1% lift in site traffic. Adding Reddit to paid
search increases ROAS by 13.7%. 

 GEN ALPHA SIDE HUSTLES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Gen Alpha is turning screen time into income with 47.1% earning money
online through digital side hustles such as reselling clothes,
streaming games, or posting content. This represents a 15% increase
from last year. Social media shaped this generation, making online
earning a natural part of their lives as they watch creators on
platforms like YouTube and Twitch build successful careers. These
young entrepreneurs earn an average of $13.92 per hour, nearly double
the federal minimum wage. 1.7% already make over $40K annually. They
spend less time on screens for entertainment and more time working
online, dedicating 20.3% of their screen time to their hustles.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY YOUR BEST MARKETING CHANNEL IS DRIVING CUSTOMERS AWAY (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 67% of consumers unsubscribe from emails due to excessive frequency
and 39% ignore emails entirely because of inbox overload. Most people
prefer one to three emails per week, and nearly half unsubscribe when
content feels irrelevant or non-personalized. Although email drives
more purchases than social ads, capturing attention depends on
thoughtful timing and clear value. 

 THE INVISIBLE CEILING THAT LIMITS SAAS AND SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESSES
(AND HOW TO SMASH THROUGH IT) (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Churn acts as an invisible cap on growth for subscription businesses
by setting a limit where customer loss matches acquisition. A 10%
monthly churn, for example, means customers stay for only 10 months,
which caps growth even if 100 new customers join each month. Reducing
churn or increasing traffic helps but often hits limits due to
difficulty and cost. The most effective lever is conversion rate
optimization, which improves both acquisition and retention, raising
the growth ceiling more sustainably. 

 IN A ZERO-CLICK WORLD, TRAFFIC IS A TERRIBLE GOAL (3 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Traffic has become a vanity metric and a poor primary goal. Nearly
every major platform (Google, social media, and even AI tools) is
sending out less referral traffic than before. Measuring success by
total website visits no longer reflects business impact. People now
consume content directly on platforms like Reddit, YouTube, or TikTok
without clicking through. Chasing traffic misses the point when
visibility, engagement, and trust are being built offsite. Instead,
focus on metrics that tie directly to business outcomes like qualified
leads, conversion rates, and product page engagement. Trying to grow
traffic now is harder than ever and less likely to move the needle.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 TYPE OF CONTENT CHATGPT IS MORE LIKELY TO CITE (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ChatGPT uses current web content only for queries it sees as timely,
ranked, or tied to recent events. For evergreen topics, it defaults to
its 2024 training data and does not search the web or cite sources.
This means a lot of SEO content focused on evergreen queries may not
be surfaced in real-time AI responses. Instead, brands have a better
chance of being referenced by creating timely, structured, and
well-sourced content. Articles with data, rankings, comparisons, and
clear citations are more likely to be used. 

 THE GEAR SOCIAL MARKETERS RECOMMEND (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The most recommended tool among social media managers was not a
camera or light, but a microphone, as mentioned by over 150
respondents in a study who cited poor audio as a dealbreaker. While
iPhones remain the dominant filming device, many teams also use
stabilizers, magnetic tripods, and wireless rigs to improve content
quality on the go. The wide range of accessories from ergonomic chairs
to SD card readers highlights how production and editing are often
happening in nontraditional workspaces.

 THE INTERNET KILLED GENERAL-PURPOSE PRODUCTS. AI WILL BRING THEM BACK
(4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 General-purpose products are dying across industries because
companies that focus on a single customer benefit, like price or
convenience, outperform those trying to do everything. Department
stores, sitcoms, and universities lost relevance as specialized
competitors took their place. AI is set to reverse this trend by
enabling products to deliver multiple high-value benefits at once
through extreme personalization. This shift could re-centralize
industries around powerful general-purpose offerings, especially in
retail, media, and education. 

 WHY BEING “CHRONICALLY ONLINE” ISN'T ACTUALLY GOOD FOR SOCIAL
PROS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 True strategy comes from knowing your brand's voice and goals, not
chasing every viral trend. Experienced social managers understand
platform content without endless scrolling. Audiences prefer
thoughtful engagement over immediate replies, and meaningful content
outperforms fast content. To create original work, social pros study
why content performs well. Social media reflects culture but does not
create it.
