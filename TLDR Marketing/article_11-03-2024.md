 WHAT‚ÄôS GOING ON WITH THE NEW BILL THAT COULD BAN TIKTOK? (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Congress wants to force TikTok to part with its Chinese parent
company, ByteDance, amid concerns over national security. Despite
strong bipartisan support in Congress and President Biden‚Äôs
endorsement, the fate of the Protecting Americans from Foreign
Adversary Controlled Applications Act remains uncertain. TikTok pushed
back with a mass in-app message to US users last Thursday morning,
complete with a button for calling their representatives. If the bill
does become law, Apple‚Äôs App Store and Google Play will not be able
to legally distribute the app in the US. 

 GEN Z BROKE THE MARKETING FUNNEL (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gen Z is reshaping the customer journey. They‚Äôre departing from the

exploration, community, and loyalty. Gen Z is no longer trusting
first-touch discovery executed directly by brands. Brands need to rely
more on creators for discovery and ensure their top-of-funnel
marketing is less sales and more engagement.

 THE WEIRD COMMUNITY MODEL THAT ACTUALLY WORKS 10X BETTER (4 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Most branded communities fail because they feel forced and overly
promotional. However, Sticker Mule's recently launched community is
already generating high user engagement, targeted reach, valuable
data, and organic brand advocacy. The new community is a social
network called Stimulus, where brands can get attention by giving away
gifts, and users win them by simply interacting on the platform. To
replicate this new community model, create incentives that give users
a reason to return, partner with other brands to boost content supply,
and host the community on your own platform to maintain control and
retain data. 

 YOUR OPEN AND CLICKS OF YOUR EMAIL CAMPAIGN AREN‚ÄôT RELIABLE OR
ACCURATE (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Recent changes by Apple and Google have undermined the reliability of
email open and click data, impacting the effectiveness of email
marketing campaigns. Apple's Mail Privacy Protection feature and
Google Workspace's link-scanning process have distorted open and click
rates, making them unreliable indicators of engagement. To mitigate
this issue, email service providers could adopt technological
solutions like substituting images for tracking pixels, while
marketers are encouraged to rely on UTM campaign query strings for
more accurate measurements.
