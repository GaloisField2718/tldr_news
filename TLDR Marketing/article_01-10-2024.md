 CUSTOM AI POSTS IN OUR INSTAGRAM FEEDS? NO THANKS, META (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Meta is testing AI-generated content in Instagram and Facebook feeds,
featuring custom images based on user interests. This may include
AI-generated versions of users themselves. Critics are concerned this
will clutter feeds and blur the line between real and AI-generated
content, exacerbating misinformation issues. Although Meta plans to
label such content, previous attempts at similar labeling have caused
confusion.

GOOGLE SERIOUSLY (3 MINUTE READ) [5]

 6 PSYCHOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES TO HELP YOU WRITE GREAT SOCIAL MEDIA HOOKS
(12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Open loops generate curiosity by withholding information, hooking
users to stay engaged for the reveal. The bandwagon effect leverages
social proof by highlighting how others are participating, tapping
into the desire to join in on trends. Contrarian statements challenge
conventional wisdom, sparking interest through bold perspectives. FOMO
creates urgency with time-sensitive offers, prompting immediate
action. 

 5 SEO MISTAKES TO AVOID WHEN UPDATING BLOG POSTS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Good content delivers specific answers promptly, avoiding unnecessary
details that distract readers. Aligning with reader intent is
essential; prioritize "How to do X" over "What is X." Meta titles
should be engaging, optimized, and position core keywords at the
front. Products should be authentically integrated into the content to
create effective calls to action, without directing readers to
competitors. Basic SEO practices are still crucial ‚Äî keywords should
be in headers, content optimized for featured snippets, and relevant
articles interlinked to boost visibility.

 HOW TO THRIVE AS A FOUNDING PMM AND BUILD YOUR FIRST TEAM (8 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Founding PMMs should focus on key strategic initiatives instead of
trying to meet everyone's demands. Educate others about the PMM
function's value and establish processes for scaling as you gain early
wins. Use the 4Ps framework ‚Äî Purpose, People, Process, and
Performance ‚Äî to guide team building. Begin with a small team and
consider part-time and third-party hires. Develop processes based on
pilots rather than rigid templates, seeking feedback from adjacent
teams. Finally, define success metrics for both the team and
individual members, providing constructive feedback to foster growth.
