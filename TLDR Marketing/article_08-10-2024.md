 U.S. CONSUMERS ARE FED UP WITH EXCESSIVE TEXTS AND EMAILS (8 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 40% of U.S. consumers unsubscribe from digital marketing
communications at least once a week, citing excessive messages as a
primary reason. Many feel overwhelmed by the volume, with 56% opting
out if they receive 4+ messages from a brand in a month. This fatigue
is driving a shift in how consumers interact with brands - they are
becoming more protective of their data and selective about engagement.


 GOOGLE MUST CRACK OPEN ANDROID FOR THIRD-PARTY STORES, RULES EPIC
JUDGE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google must open its Android platform to third-party app stores
starting November 1. It will also be required to distribute these
rival stores through Google Play and remove restrictions on
third-party billing and app links. The decision, part of the Epic v.
Google case, aims to dismantle Google's monopoly on the app
marketplace and promote competition. Google plans to appeal. This
ruling could reshape the Android ecosystem, encouraging more
competition by 2027.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WILD'S CONTEXT-AWARE MESSAGE BAR (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Wild achieved 152% growth by using a context-aware message bar that
updated as users progressed through the funnel, providing clear,
relevant prompts. The yellow bar's non-standard placement at the
bottom of the screen ensured it stood out, with messages like ‚ÄúAdd a
case or two‚Äù guiding users smoothly. It used social proof statements
such as ‚ÄúMost customers add 3 refills‚Äù to nudge customers toward
larger purchases by normalizing higher quantities. Testing this tactic
revealed how targeted, evolving messaging can influence conversions
and average order value. 

 HOW ‚ÄúFREE SHIPPING & FREE RETURNS‚Äù AFFECTS CONVERSION RATES (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mentioning "Free Shipping & Free Returns" under the add to cart
button tends to increase conversion rate for products with
price-sensitive customers. However, this addition can have a negative
effect for luxury items, as it could degrade the premium feel of the
page. What works for one site or industry might not work for another,
and visitors might need multiple reminders of a value prop on a
website.

 CAN MARKETING DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH AGAIN? (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Despite doubling their media spend, 20 of the top 50 advertisers saw
slower revenue growth than the 2.1% GDP rate over the past 15 years.
The trend highlights the need for CMOs to shift from a focus on brand
awareness to strategies that directly drive revenue. CMOs can leverage
Media Mix Modeling to determine the best allocation of media dollars,
critically assess targeting strategies, and cut back on
underperforming channels.

 WHY SCIENCE NEEDS MARKETING (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Scientists need marketers to communicate their findings and combat
misinformation. Marketing should be integrated into scientific
research from the start and research grants should include funding for
communication strategies. This collaboration is critical for driving
public action on urgent issues like climate change, public health, and
sustainability. Without proper marketing support, scientific
discoveries may fail to impact behavior on a large scale.
