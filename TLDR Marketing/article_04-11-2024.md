 MARKETERS IN A DYING INTERNET: WHY THE ONLY OPTION IS A RETURN TO
SIMPLICITY (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 As bots and AI content flood online spaces, marketers face growing
challenges in connecting with their audiences. Increasing distrust in
AI is reflected in declining engagement on major social media
platforms. To adapt, marketers should prioritize simplicity and
authenticity. This may involve rediscovering older channels like TV
and radio, leveraging word-of-mouth strategies, and engaging with
niche communities that prioritize real social connections. 

 WHO SPENDS THE MOST TIME ON SOCIAL MEDIA? (1 MINUTE READ) [6]

users spend nearly 2.5 hours per day on social media, with TikTok
seeing the highest average time per user and YouTube dominating
overall usage. Women spend an average of 16 minutes more daily than
men. Japan reports the lowest social media use at 1 hour and 53
minutes per day.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MARKETING TEARDOWN: PUNCHING UP (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 “Punching up” is when lower-status brands challenge higher-status
competitors to emphasize their underdog appeal, often attracting
empathy and loyalty from audiences. Examples include Ben & Jerry's
versus Häagen-Dazs, Beehiiv challenging ConvertKit, and Avis
embracing its #2 position to avoid promoting the top competitor.
Successful campaigns are subversive but can face backlash. The tactic
works best when targeting stagnant incumbents. 

 HOW TO CREATE A VALUE PROPOSITION: A FOUR-STEP FRAMEWORK (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A strong value proposition defines a company's purpose, target
customers, and solution to a pressing problem, attracting both
investors and customers. To create one, identify the problem,
highlight the risks of inaction, connect product features to the
issue, and provide proof of effectiveness. Concise, customer-focused
propositions that address specific pain points resonate with potential
customers. 

 SIZE MATTERS ON LINKEDIN (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Square posts are too small on LinkedIn, as you have less space to
work with and also take up less space on the feed. Use a 4:5 ratio
instead (1200px X 1500px).

 WHY ACCOUNT-BASED EXPANSION IS B2B'S NEXT GROWTH LEVER (4 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Account-based expansion is more cost-effective than new acquisitions,
shortens sales cycles, and leverages customer data for targeted
growth. Traditional B2B marketing and sales models prioritize new
logos, which leads to missed expansion opportunities. Key tactics
include creating account-specific content, using customer data for
precise targeting, and aligning sales, marketing, and customer
success. A structured, data-driven approach helps identify and grow
high-potential accounts, unlocking significant revenue within the
current customer base.
