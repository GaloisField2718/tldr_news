NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY THE HOUSE VOTED TO BAN TIKTOK AND WHAT COULD COME BACK (5 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The House passed a bill requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok or face
having it banned on US devices. The bill received bipartisan backing
with a 352-65 vote. Proponents argue the measure is vital for national
security, while opponents contend it violates free speech rights and
could harm businesses. The bill‚Äôs fate in the Senate remains
uncertain. 

 COMPANIES CAN NOW PROMOTE MEMBER CONTENT WITH LINKEDIN THOUGHT LEADER
ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 LinkedIn is expanding its Thought Leader ads by enabling businesses
to promote content from any user in the app, not just their own
employees. To help prevent content from being promoted without
consent, creators will receive a notification asking them to approve
or deny requests to promote their posts.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù NAVIGATION INCREASED SALES BY 32% (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ferplast, an online pet supply store, found through research and
analysis that visitors were failing to find what they wanted and
almost 90% of them never reached a product page. The brand tested a
full-width navigation menu against the control hamburger menu,
resulting in a 32% increase in sales. This worked because the new
navigation gave users a clear forward path and exposed the breadth and
depth of the brand‚Äôs product range. 

 15 WAYS TO USE ANIMATION IN YOUR MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Animations can elevate story-telling in sales decks, emails, and
landing pages. Figma uses product hero animations to convey its
product value and differentiation faster. Mutiny enhances its case
study page with subtle movement upon hover. Mailchimp uses animation
to create micro-interactions with users‚Äô product experiences (eg. an
animated high-five after users send emails). 

 INCREASE SALES WITH THE PSYCH ENERGY FRAMEWORK (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Psych energy is your customers' emotional response as they go through
your funnel. It is measured from 0 to 100 and it increases or
decreases based on customer interactions. The Psych Energy Framework
is useful for determining if you are providing enough positive value
to your potential customers before asking something from them. For
example, share demos and case studies before asking for personal data
to increase the chances of conversion.

 FROM 0 TO 10 MILLION USERS IN FOUR YEARS (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Copy.ai rapidly scaled from 0 to 10 million users in four years by
leveraging AI technology. To grow so fast, it launched an MVP within
weeks, utilized only 7 software tools for development, and adopted a
'prosumer' model with an early monetization scheme starting at $3 per
month. It also leveraged AI to accelerate product development and
distribution. 

 BUYER PSYCHOLOGY OF COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Cognitive Load Theory explains why people forget key information and
make suboptimal choices when overloaded with sensory information.
Brands can mitigate this by breaking down choice architecture into
chunks, for example, organizing a huge product catalog into
understandable categories. It also helps to simplify complex systems,
just as WeightWatchers did by distilling weight loss into a points
system. Use imagery with product specifications to help users
understand specific product features more easily. 

 WHERE WEB USERS SPEND TIME VS. WHERE TRAFFIC REFERRALS ORIGINATE (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Just because most of your traffic comes from Google, doesn‚Äôt mean
you should spend most of your digital marketing effort on Google.
Social media, productivity, news, and e-commerce sites all have a
larger share of total web visits than search engines, which means that
search isn‚Äôt the most significant opportunity for capturing new
users. Instead, invest in the sources of influence to which your
audience pays attention, such as social accounts they follow, podcasts
they listen to, or specific websites they visit.
