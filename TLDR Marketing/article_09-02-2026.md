NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW YOUTUBE IS TAKING SUPER BOWL ADS BEYOND A 30-SECOND PLAY (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 YouTube is expanding Super Bowl advertising beyond traditional
30-second spots by surrounding the event with creator-driven content
and live activations. The platform leverages creator partnerships,
pre-game events like a flag football game, and sponsorship packages to
embed brands into cultural moments. AI-powered campaigns help
advertisers reach new audiences, while AdBlitz amplifies exposure,
with 45% of viewers seeing content only on YouTube. 

 AMAZON'S ADS ARE PAYING OFF. WHAT ITS AI SPENDING DELIVERS IS LESS
CERTAIN (3 MINUTE READ) [6]

questions about future returns. Q4 revenue rose 14% to $213.4B, ad
revenue grew 22% to $21.3B, and AWS sales increased 24% to $35.6B.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A MODEL FOR BUILDING STRONG BRANDS IN THE INTENT ECONOMY (10 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The intent economy is a system where marketing responds directly to
real-time consumer intent instead of relying on assumptions or
campaigns. AI detects needs, acts immediately, and learns from every
interaction. The four-part model starts with relevance, which ensures
a product is considered. Distinctiveness makes it noticed.
Differentiation provides a reason to choose it. Default makes it the
automatic choice and allows continuous optimization. 

 HOW TO AUTOMATE YOUR RE-ENGAGEMENT AND SUNSET EFFORTS (1 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 First, set up a subscriber lifecycle automation to check in at key
intervals, like 90, 180, 270, and 365 days. Add personalization over
time. Second, implement a sunset policy that automatically
unsubscribes contacts who show no engagement. Together, these steps
protect deliverability, recover potential revenue from partially
engaged users, and remove the burden of manual list management.

 I FIRED MY TEAM AND HIRED CLAUDE OPUS 4.6 (9 MINUTE READ) [10]

connects Claude to files, apps, and multi-step tasks, while Plugins
bundle Skills with tool integrations and slash commands. The guide
covers building Skills without code, applying them across content and
visualization tasks, leveraging pre-built libraries, and creating
custom plugins to scale team output efficiently.

 GROWTH ENGINEER IS THE NEW GROWTH MARKETER (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Growth engineers are a hybrid of growth marketer and engineer. They
think less about running experiments and more about building the
infrastructure that enables those experiments. AI tools enable teams
to execute independently, accelerating iteration as software build
costs fall. Canva's programmatic SEO templates illustrate this scale,
and companies like Ramp are already hiring for this hybrid role. 

 HOW SPOTIFY HACKED FACEBOOK (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In 2011, Facebook's Open Graph let apps automatically share user
activity on friends' feeds. Spotify leveraged this by connecting
listens to Facebook, turning each play into a discovery loop that
drove millions of new users. It increased engagement and boosted paid
subscriptions fivefold in under two years. Many apps that relied
solely on virality, like SocialCam and Viddy, collapsed when Facebook
limited auto-sharing. Sustainable growth depends on both platform
tailwinds and core product value.
