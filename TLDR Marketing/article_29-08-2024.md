 TIKTOK'S ‚ÄòHOPECORE' TREND SHOWS THE BEST‚ÄîAND WORST‚ÄîOF INTERNET
OPTIMISM (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 TikTok's "hopecore" trend began with uplifting clips of Grammy wins,
Olympic victories, and heartwarming moments. However, it soon faced
backlash as users started using the tag to ironically frame bleak
stories with exaggerated positivity. This shift highlights the
internet's tendency to turn wholesome trends into cynical expressions
of pessimism.

 VALUE INNOVATION: HOW TO WIN IN CROWDED MARKETS BY IGNORING
COMPETITORS (4 MINUTE READ) [6]

solved a huge problem for customers. To find opportunities for value

find the factors that increase costs for no gain, raise the factors
that truly matter for customers, and consider creating new factors
that no one else offers.

 WHY STARTUP MARKETERS SHOULD BE DIAGNOSTICIANS ‚Äî ADVICE FROM
OPENAI'S AND STRIPE'S FIRST MARKETING HIRE (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Krithika Muthukumar, the very first marketer at OpenAI and Stripe,
discusses what it takes to found and scale a marketing operation to
build an enduring brand. A great early marketer doesn't blindly follow
a playbook, is genuinely curious about the product, has a T-shaped
skill set, and isn't distracted by vanity metrics. In their first
month, they should create a ‚Äústate of the funnel‚Äù report and
shadow customer calls. Building a brand is often a bottoms-up motion
rather than a top-down decision, so Muthukumar recommends developing a
razor-sharp POV about what the product is for, learning how your
audience talks and wants to be spoken to, and overinvesting in
marketing craft. 

 TIKTOK LIVE IS THE NEW GOLD RUSH (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 TikTok Live has become a lucrative platform, with some livestreamers
earning over $7K/month through viewer donations. Streamers engage
their audiences in "battles" where viewers donate coins to influence
outcomes, often driven by creative or trending themes. The demand for
making money through these streams has led to new opportunities,
including developing interactive games, selling leads lists, and
offering video overlays. 

 THE CASE FOR BRAND MORTALITY IN AN ERA OF LEGACY-CHASERS (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Brands are often built to last forever, but the obsession with brand
immortality might be limiting creativity and relevance. Instead of
striving for permanence, brands should embrace their mortality,
focusing on making a meaningful impact in the present rather than
adhering to rigid consistency. Shifting this mindset could unlock new
creative opportunities and allow brands to contribute more actively to
the world around them.
