NEWS & TRENDS

 MORE THAN A FEELING: HOW POSITIVE PLATFORMS IMPACT PERFORMANCE (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Research shows that people are 20% more emotionally engaged with
content on platforms they perceive as positive and spend 15% more time
looking at ads. Ads in these environments are also twice as
trustworthy and 1.5X more likeable. Platforms viewed as positive can
increase purchase intent by up to 94%. Media-buying strategies that
incorporate viewability and positivity can boost sales by 24%. 

 FOR GEN Z, VIRAL VIDEOS ARE THE NEW PRIMETIME (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Gen Z now prefers social media creators to traditional entertainers,
with about half reporting stronger connections with influencers than
with TV or movie personalities. Despite six hours of average daily
screen time, viewers are not spending more, which forces traditional
studios to compete with platforms offering free, personalized content.
At the same time, frustrations with rising streaming costs and
fragmented services are pushing younger audiences further toward
creator-led videos.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 COMPANY CULTURE AS MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Companies with strong cultures have a turnover rate of 13.9%,
compared to 48.4% for those without. Engaged employees who feel a
sense of purpose positively impact customer experience and become
brand advocates, a concept called “internal marketing.”
Employee-generated content, like social media posts and blogs, boosts
authenticity and strengthens the brand. Companies that prioritize
culture, empower employees, and lead by example create stronger brands
and outperform competitors in profitability and customer retention. 

 HOW TO USE DISRUPTIVE STORYTELLING TO THRIVE AS A MARKETER (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Disruptive storytelling is built around changing the narrative, the
medium, or the messenger. Disrupting the message involves crafting
unconventional narratives that challenge industry norms or provoke
strong emotions. For example, e.l.f. Cosmetics launched music videos
instead of magazine ads and Nutter Butter mimicked horror movies on
TikTok. Disrupting the medium means meeting audiences where they are
through immersive platforms like Roblox, interactive tattoos, or
QR-enabled AR experiences. Disrupting the messenger means stepping
back and letting fans, employees, or niche communities become your
storytellers.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 PYTHON FOR SEO, EXPLAINED FOR BEGINNERS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Python can automate repetitive SEO tasks like checking for broken
links, analyzing rankings, and scraping metadata in minutes. Tools
like Replit, Google Colab, and VS Code make it easy for beginners to
get started without complex setup. Key concepts to learn include
variables, loops, functions, lists, and dictionaries, along with using
libraries like requests, beautifulsoup4, and pandas. Essential
SEO-related Python skills include making HTTP requests, parsing HTML,
handling CSVs, and using APIs. Beginners can quickly build useful
scripts that check HTTPS status, identify missing alt attributes,
scrape metadata, and pull backlink data using APIs. 

 GLASP: YOUTUBE SUMMARY (TOOL) [9] 

 This free Chrome Extension summarizes YouTube videos and web articles
using ChatGPT, Claude, Mistral AI, and Google Gemini. It provides
video transcripts, and customizable summaries with timestamps and
supports multiple languages. Users can highlight transcripts, add
notes, and export them to apps like Notion.

 FOREVER 21 NEVER EMBRACED ITS 30S (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Forever 21's decline stems from its failure to evolve alongside
shifting consumer trends. Zara and H&M adapted by investing in new
identities or collaborations, while Forever 21 stuck to its outdated
model of fast fashion. It was unable to keep pace with changing
customer expectations. As trends became more consumer-driven, the
brand missed the opportunity to reimagine itself, losing its
relevance. 

 BREAKING COPYWRITING RULES FOR FUN AND PROFIT (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Mastering the rules of copywriting allows for breaking them
effectively. Long-form copy can be powerful when the audience is
deeply interested, making length less important than relevance and
engagement. Avoiding excessive CTAs to prevent a hard-sell tone while
trusting that motivated buyers will take action. Reinforcing the
buyer's decision after purchase builds confidence, while anchoring
perceived value makes the price feel like a bargain. Offering
high-value bonuses can eliminate doubts by making the deal feel too
good to pass up. 

 LUMON TERMINAL PRO IN APPLE'S ONLINE STORE IS A MASTER-CLASS ON MEDIA
MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple's marketing for Severance demonstrates how multimedia
storytelling and creativity can elevate a campaign without relying on
traditional methods. A fake product listing in the Apple Store,
real-world installations in New York, in-show artifacts like “The
You You Are” book, and even keyboard replicas created a narrative
universe that fans wanted to explore and engage. Unlike ad-saturated
platforms, Apple leveraged its own ecosystem to invite audiences into
the story, creating buzz through fun and creativity rather than
traditional targeting and repetition.
