 APPS MEET ALGORITHMS: HOW SOCIAL MEDIA IS CHANGING THE FUTURE OF
MOBILE APPS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Social media now drives app discovery, replacing app stores as the
main entry point. Viral videos can generate millions of downloads in
days, and algorithms determine which apps gain traction. Influencer
trust and UGC play a larger role than traditional advertising,
creating a loop where sharing fuels growth. To succeed, developers
must build apps with shareable features, integrate marketing into
design, and adapt quickly to social trends or risk being overlooked. 

 AI IN MARKETING & SALES: ADOPTION IS RISING, BUT ROLE-SPECIFIC
TRAINING ISN'T KEEPING PACE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 68% of marketing and sales professionals in the US and UK are already
using AI at work, with 51% using AI agents. However, only 17% have
received comprehensive, role-specific training. Nearly half admit to
using unapproved tools, which raises governance and compliance risks.
While 67% say AI saves time and 56% report productivity gains, only
39% feel confident it boosts revenue.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 5 THINGS B2B GETS WRONG ABOUT BRAND (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Many B2B brands weaken their identity by over-focusing on ROI. A
common mistake is confusing product positioning with brand
positioning. This results in messaging that feels like a feature list
rather than an emotional or aspirational reason to care. Brands also
lose strength when sales dictates messaging, when companies avoid
taking a stand, or when success is measured only through short-term
KPIs like clickthrough rates instead of long-term metrics such as
brand awareness and sentiment. 

 HOW WILLOW GOT 1K USERS FROM REDDIT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The key is to start by acting like a genuine Redditor. Engage, post,
and build history before mentioning the product. Study the top
subreddits in the niche to learn what content performs, then create
posts that follow proven formats like story-driven arcs or practical
tips, keeping them 95% valuable and under 5% promotional with subtle
product mentions and no links. Treat it like a numbers game by
drafting and testing many posts. To scale, advanced tactics such as
aged accounts or proxies can help, but the foundation remains
understanding the community and delivering value first.

Agital, Linkparser, and Lightshot. 

 HOW TO GET 10K FOLLOWERS ON LINKEDIN USING AI (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To reach 10K LinkedIn followers, post consistently around one clear
mission rather than hacks like pods or automation. Define a single
problem to solve, then use the shared GPT tools (provided in the
article) to refine your mission, design your profile, write posts, and
build a 30-day content calendar. Optimize your profile with a clear
headline, simple visuals, and easy links, then create posts that break
down solutions in engaging formats, using AI for research and content
ideas.

 THE LEVELS REVOLUTION: HOW ONE STARTUP MADE GLUCOSE MONITORING COOL
FOR HEALTHY PEOPLE (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Levels Health built its brand by reframing continuous glucose
monitors as lifestyle tools rather than medical devices. Before
launch, it built a 40K+ waitlist and turned early adopters into
evangelists, creating social proof that made the product cultural
currency. Its marketing runs like a media company, producing blogs,
podcasts, and videos for education, distributed across Instagram,
YouTube, LinkedIn, and X. By prioritizing education and community over
growth tactics, customers end up selling themselves on the product. 

 FASHION MODELS RECKON WITH AI MODELS AND DIGITAL CLONES AFTER
CONTROVERSIAL AD APPEARS IN VOGUE (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI-generated models and digital clones are reshaping the fashion
industry. In 2024, there were 5,350 modeling jobs nationwide, with
employment projected to remain flat through 2033. The median pay for a
model that year was $89,990, but digital clones may earn less per job
even if they allow for more work without travel. While companies like
Guess and H&M have experimented with AI models, they have faced
backlash over job displacement and unrealistic beauty standards. The
industry is uncertain about how human models and AI will coexist.
