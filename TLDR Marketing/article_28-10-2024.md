NEWS & TRENDS

 REACH DETHRONES ENGAGEMENT RATE IN INFLUENCER MARKETING SUCCESS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Marketers now prioritize reach, which measures total audience
exposure, over engagement rate, which has dropped to 48% as a key
metric. Budgets continue to rise, with more brands spending over $5
million annually, while Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube remain the top
platforms. Creator-generated content is increasingly being repurposed
for paid and brand-owned channels, broadening the impact of influencer
assets. Traditional agency partnerships are declining - 76% of brands
plan to consolidate with a single influencer agency in 2025. 

 WELCOME TO ‘CHAOS PACKAGING' (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chaos packaging involves using unconventional containers to make
products stand out, especially on social media. Examples include Flo
tampons in ice cream tubs to address both cravings and shelf appeal
and Vacation sunscreen packaged in whipped cream cans. While startups
benefit from the flexibility to innovate with packaging, established
brands often rely on familiar designs to maintain consumer trust.
Overly chaotic designs can lead to confusion, as seen with Puracy's
soda-like containers, which raised safety concerns.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 8 REAL-WORLD CONTENT EXPERIENCE EXAMPLES (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This piece shares SEO content examples that serve search intent
without relying on lengthy blog posts. Aptamil's FAQ-style page
quickly addresses pregnancy-related questions in a concise format.
Wise's currency converter page and Coolors' interactive color palette
generator attract millions of visitors monthly by offering
straightforward, tool-based content. Platforms like Planable and
Alphabetimals use interactive tools to target specific audiences,
while Red Bull's and Storylane's interactive storytelling showcase the
benefits of immersive and visually engaging experiences. 

 THE STEP-BY-STEP PLAYBOOK TO HIJACK SPOTIFY WRAPPED (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 This year's Spotify Wrapped will dominate social feeds with
personalized recaps of user activity on December 4. Ride the wave by
launching your own Wrapped-style campaigns — personal,
industry-based, or humor-driven — using data only you can provide.
Fast execution and employee engagement are critical to successfully
capitalize on Spotify's release. 

 YOUR BRAND GUIDELINES ARE NOT ENOUGH (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Brand guidelines often lack the depth needed to build a distinct
brand, focusing too narrowly on static elements like logos and colors.
In contrast, a Brand Playbook captures the brand's personality through
real examples of actions, campaigns, and partnerships. Brands like
Liquid Death stand out because they go beyond guidelines, using bold
actions to communicate their identity across all channels. Building a
Brand Playbook involves mapping out key touchpoints, aligning on
positioning, and providing actionable examples that inspire fresh
ideas.

 RETHINKING SEO: BUILD PRODUCTS, NOT JUST CONTENT (4 MINUTE READ) [15]


 The traditional content-first SEO strategy often drives traffic
without converting users, as seen with SurveyMonkey's initial struggle
to turn blog views into paying customers. Shifting to product-led SEO
— like creating survey templates or software integration pages —
helped companies such as Zapier and Coinbase better meet user intent
and drive meaningful results. 

 THE FRAGMENTATION OF SEARCH: WHY SEARCH AND DISCOVERY JUST ISN'T THE
SAME ANYMORE (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 With search behavior fragmented across apps, TikTok and Instagram
have become key platforms where users discover brands, replacing some
of Google's original role. Search intent varies across platforms:
users browse TikTok for inspiration while visiting Amazon with the
intent to purchase. Brands that embrace these shifts by offering
personalized, niche content will better engage with today's audience.
