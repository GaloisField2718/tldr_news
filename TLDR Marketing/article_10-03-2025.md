NEWS & TRENDS

 94% OF ADVERTISERS CONCERNED TARIFFS WILL LEAD TO CUT IN AD SPENDING
(1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 94% of US advertisers are concerned about tariffs impacting ad
spending, with 57% extremely concerned. Most expect a 6%-10% drop in
ad budgets, while 22% anticipate a larger decrease. Traditional media
and social ads will see the largest cuts, while CTV and online video
may be more resilient. To adjust, 45% plan to reduce overall spend,
35% will focus on performance-based campaigns, and 29% will shift to
digital channels. 66% of US consumers believe companies should cut CEO
pay in response to tariff-related inflation. 

 HOW FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE IS KEEPING YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE PLATFORM (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Facebook's Marketplace is a key driver of engagement, particularly
among younger users, despite a decline in teen usage. 32% of US teens
use Facebook, down from 71% in 2014, but 1.1 billion users across 70
countries frequent Marketplace for its no-fee listings and local
pickups. The platform competes with eBay and Craigslist and taps into
the growing $350 billion resale market. A partnership with eBay is
expected to boost sales.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MY WEIRDEST A/B TEST BLEW EVERYONE'S MIND (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A/B tests show that adding a blurred product screenshot behind a
sign-up form can boost conversions, with MyCase seeing a 94% increase.
The blurred background exploits curiosity gaps, gives users a sense of
progress, and reassures them about what they're signing up for. The
effect can be further enhanced with interactive elements like gradual
reveals and animated blur. 

 COMPANY BLOGS ARE NO LONGER WORTH THE INVESTMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Company blogs are losing relevance as traffic declines due to
Google's degraded search, AI content aggregation, and a shift to
private communities. Independent creators on Substack and LinkedIn now
attract more traffic than corporate blogs. Companies should focus on
influencer partnerships, high-engagement platforms like YouTube and
podcasts, and specialized content such as product docs and
user-generated content. Blogging isn't dead, but it's no longer a
reliable primary growth strategy.

 GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE CLUELESS ABOUT BRANDING. THE DOGE TURMOIL
SHOWS WHY THEY'VE NEEDED MARKETING CAMPAIGNS ALL ALONG (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Government agencies like the NIH and NSF fail to communicate their
value, leaving them vulnerable to political attacks and funding cuts.
Despite funding breakthroughs like Ozempic and Wegovy, they lack
branding and marketing strategies. A well-funded campaign is needed to
highlight their impact, shift public perception, and pressure
policymakers. Without better storytelling, these agencies risk further
defunding and losing public support.
