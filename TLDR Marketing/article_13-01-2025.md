 TOP 5 PRODUCT CATEGORIES DRIVING SOCIAL COMMERCE IN 2025 (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Fashion and beauty products will lead social commerce this year,
followed by home goods, electronics, and health and wellness. 53% of
consumers are likely to purchase products recommended by influencers,
trusting those with expertise, real-life usage, and non-sponsored
posts. YouTube ranks highest for product research, while Facebook
leads in purchases. 

 AS TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES, IT BECOMES HARDER TO TELL ‘REAL' AI FROM
MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The broad definition and public perception of “artificial
intelligence” make it hard to distinguish genuine AI from marketing
claims, leading to "AI washing." True AI involves machine learning and
deep learning, but many companies adopt AI tools without clear
strategies, fearing obsolescence. While AI excels in pattern
recognition and data processing, creativity and originality remain
uniquely human. 

 TIKTOK BAN: HOW BOTH SIDES MADE THEIR CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT AND
WHAT THE JUSTICES ASKED (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Supreme Court heard arguments on a law requiring ByteDance to
divest TikTok's U.S. operations by January 19 or face a ban. TikTok
argued the law violates First Amendment rights and that divestiture is
unfeasible due to China's control over the algorithm. The DOJ cited
ByteDance's ties to the Chinese government as a national security
risk. The Justices focused on the balance between free speech,
national security, and the feasibility of divestiture without Chinese
regulations.

 WIKIPEDIA'S $169M "MAYBE LATER" TRICK (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Wikipedia's “Maybe Later” button on its donation popup helped
raise $169M last year by asking for users' emails and sending
reminders. This leverages the “consistency effect,” where users
are more likely to convert after mentally committing to considering
the offer. 

 80/20 WAY TO FIND YOUR ICP (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To quickly refine your ICP, identify top customers based on renewal,
product usage, and satisfaction. Use AI to analyze shared traits like
industry, size, and business model, then validate findings with other
data. Interview customers fitting these traits to uncover their
priorities, pain points, and triggers for using your product. Conduct
targeted surveys to gather deeper insights on messaging, channels, and
differentiation.

 ICE FRAMEWORK: HOW (NOT) TO SCORE/PRIORITIZE GROWTH EXPERIMENTS (6
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The ICE Framework helps prioritize growth ideas by scoring them on
impact, confidence, and ease, each rated from 0-10. Scores are
multiplied to rank ideas, allowing data-driven decisions and efficient
resource allocation. It isn't suited for long-term planning or complex
projects. The framework can overlook high-impact ideas if they're
difficult to execute, so adjustments may be needed. 

 SEO TIP: CHECK YOUR LOG FILES (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Look for crawl instances from Perplexitybot (Perplexity) and GPTBot
(OpenAI) in your log files to determine if AI search engines are
discovering your content.

 THE PRICE OF YOUR PRODUCT IS WRONG (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Pricing is an iterative process that should adapt to market shifts.
Surveys and focus groups can misrepresent true willingness to pay due
to unaccounted friction. Effective pricing requires testing multiple
price points, isolating pricing changes, and measuring conversion,
retention, and expansion rates. Price sensitivity tests and segmenting
new users during testing yield cleaner insights. 

 WHAT'S CHANGING WITH AI MONETIZATION (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 54% of AI products are adopting new models like usage-based and
skill-based pricing. OpenAI's ChatGPT Pro at $200/month sets a high
benchmark, while companies like Cognition and 11x focus on charging
for tasks or outputs instead of seats. This shift reflects customer
demand for simpler, value-driven models that focus on higher skill
levels over traditional flat fees.
