 BOOKSWARM SECURES 230+ WORDPRESS SITES AND ELIMINATES DDOS RISKS WITH
KINSTA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Simon Appleby, founder of Bookswarm, was losing holidays to server
emergencies while managing 230+ WordPress sites [4] for publishing
clients.

Shared servers were slowing things down and exposing every site to
potential security threats. Hosting issues were consuming time he
needed for his agency.

With Kinsta's isolated containers, Cloudflare security, and expert-led
migrations [5], Bookswarm moved hundreds of sites stress-free.

Now, PAGE SPEED HAS INCREASED, downtime is considerably less, and
Simon spends whole days without thinking about hosting issues at all.

“_Kinsta has unquestionably taken the stress out of hosting,_”
says Simon. "_It's freed me up to spend more time doing what I want to
do._"

too [4]

NEWS & TRENDS

 TEMU'S US AD SPEND CRATERS AMID ESCALATING TRADE WAR WITH CHINA (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 As U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods rise to 125%, Temu has halted nearly
all ad spend, with Google Shopping impressions falling from 40-50% in
early April to 0% by April 12. Social activity also dried up,
including a full stop in TikTok sponsorships. The drop created a
temporary inventory surplus, but few brands are rushing in due to
economic uncertainty and shifting budgets. 

 THE 2025 AI INDEX REPORT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The 2025 edition of Stanford's AI Index Report found that AI is
increasingly embedded in everyday life. AI performance is improving
rapidly, with benchmark scores rising by up to 67.3 percentage points
in one year and language models sometimes outperforming humans in
coding tasks. Business investment in AI reached $109.1 billion in the
U.S. alone, and 78% of organizations now use AI, up from 55% in 2023.
The U.S. leads in model output, but China is closing the quality gap
while dominating in publications and patents. Governments are
increasing regulation and investment, but global optimism and
education access remain uneven.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DOES EVERY MARKETING CHANNEL *ACTUALLY* SUCK RIGHT NOW? (9 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Marketing in 2025 is harder but not hopeless. Big, traditional
channels like SEO and ads are saturated, but still useful when
approached strategically. Emerging “little channels” like
community and influencer marketing are becoming more scalable thanks
to new tools. Success now depends on strong products and standout
marketing—differentiation is key. Human-centered, creative, and
trust-based marketing is rising in value, and teams need to stay
nimble, make focused bets, and avoid one-size-fits-all playbooks. 

 DARK COLORS MAKE PRODUCTS SEEM MORE EFFECTIVE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Darker packaging makes products seem stronger and more effective,
leading to higher purchase interest. In experiments, 65% preferred a
darker anti-hair loss shampoo, judging it 12.3% better, and were 6.9%
more likely to buy other personal care items with dark packaging.
However, dark colors also raise concerns about side effects, which can
reduce purchase intent, especially for sensitive products. Lighter
packaging is better when safety is a key concern, such as for
children's medicines or skincare for sensitive users. 

 VECTOR'S TOP-PERFORMING LINKEDIN AD (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vector's ad combines a hook, a pain point-focused headline,
results-based UI screenshot, mascot, and CTA. Behind the scenes, it
targets high-intent contacts identified by Vector, boosting both ad
performance and budget efficiency.

 UX NEEDS A BIGGER JOB - STARTING WITH EVERYONE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 UX in D2C marketing needs to move beyond efficiency to reflect the
diversity of users, integrating accessibility and emotional resonance
into every touchpoint. When brands ignore users with disabilities or
those less familiar with tech, they lose potential revenue and
loyalty. Great UX means syncing every touchpoint, from personalized
emails to checkout flows, into a cohesive and inclusive experience.
Designing for the edges, like one-handed navigation or high-contrast
visuals, improves the experience for everyone and turns usability into
real impact. 

 GENAI: PROMPTING A BETTER MARKETING STRATEGY (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI is projected to drive 95% of customer interactions by the end of
2025. Prompts are emerging as the strategic bridge between human
intent and AI execution. Marketers are already leveraging prompt
engineering to enable hyper-personalization at scale, automate
campaign generation, and maintain consistency across channels. Some
successful examples include L'Oréal's GenAI lab generating customized
recommendations, Airbnb improving CTRs by 30% through personalized
itineraries, and Sephora increasing skincare sales by 35% using
AI-driven skin analysis.
