NEWS & TRENDS

 CANADA'S ANTITRUST WATCHDOG SUES GOOGLE ALLEGING ANTI-COMPETITIVE
CONDUCT IN ADVERTISING (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Canada's Competition Bureau is suing Google for alleged
anti-competitive practices in online advertising, seeking the sale of
two ad tech tools and a penalty for compliance. The Bureau found
Google to be the largest provider in Canada's ad tech market and
accused it of abusing its dominant position to maintain market power.
Google denies the allegations, citing robust competition and the role
of its tools in supporting businesses and content creators. The case
parallels similar antitrust actions in the U.S. and EU. 

 YES, THAT VIRAL LINKEDIN POST YOU READ WAS PROBABLY AI-GENERATED (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Over 54% of longer English posts on LinkedIn are likely AI-generated.
There has been an 189% spike in usage in early 2023 following
ChatGPT's launch. LinkedIn doesn't track AI-written content but works
to detect low-quality or duplicate posts. Adam Walkiewicz, head of
"feed relevance," views AI as a tool for drafting but stresses the
importance of original ideas.

 BEAUTY IS IN THE ALGORITHM OF THE BEHOLDER (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Ozempic and similar drugs are reshaping weight loss and beauty trends
as their costs drop, potentially altering cultural beauty standards.
Historically, status symbols lose their appeal when they become widely
accessible. This happened with spiced foods and physical plumpness in
past centuries. It's estimated that 10% of Americans will use GLP-1
drugs like Ozempic by 2030. 

 CONTENT MARKETING PAYS OFF (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Effective content marketing builds trust, attracts inbound leads, and
positions businesses as trusted authorities, which leads to positive
financial results in the long run. Businesses typically progress
through five stages, starting from experimenting with content to
achieving a substantial share of revenue through it. Content marketing
creates a broad halo effect, creating brand recognition and
credibility beyond the immediate scope of the content. 

 HOW SOCIAL MEDIA CREATED BEAUTY'S NEW DIALECT (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Social media has transformed beauty into platform-specific languages.
Pinterest leans into soft aesthetics, while TikTok drives bold trends
like “glass skin” and #GRWM. Platforms like KIKI World enable user
co-creation, disrupting top-down approaches. Beauty terms now shape
identity and consumer behavior. To succeed, brands must adapt to
platform styles and align with generational values, as younger
audiences see beauty vernacular as social currency.
