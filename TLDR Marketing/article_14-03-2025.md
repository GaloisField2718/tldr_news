NEWS & TRENDS

 ORACLE EMERGES AS MOST LIKELY PARTNER FOR US TIKTOK DEAL (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 With the US mandating TikTok's divestment, Oracle has emerged as the
top choice for a partnership, mostly due to its past work on TikTok's
US data separation project. While Trump claims multiple bids are in
play, Oracle's close ties to his administration give it a strategic
advantage. The main sticking point is China's refusal to allow the
transfer of TikTok's core algorithms as part of the deal. 

 SPEED OF SOUND: HOW DIGITAL INNOVATION IS ACCELERATING THE AUDIO
ADVANTAGE FOR ADVERTISERS (17 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Commercial audio in the UK is rapidly growing, reaching 76% of adults
weekly and generating 627.5 million listening hours per week. Digital
audio, particularly podcasts, is a major driver of growth, with
podcast ad revenues increasing by 43% over two years, making up 47% of
digital audio ad spend. Audio advertising is highly effective,
boosting ad awareness by 49%, brand relevance by 24%, and brand trust
by 32%, while also increasing purchase consideration by 18%. Digital
audio enhances targeting, engagement, and real-time measurement,
allowing advertisers to optimize campaigns efficiently. Multi-platform
audio strategies, including broadcast and digital formats, maximize
reach and ROI, with research suggesting allocating at least 20% of
media budgets to audio for better campaign performance.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NEW FAVORITE B2B AD FORMAT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 LinkedIn's Thought Leader Ads are native posts with ad spend behind
them, making them blend seamlessly into users' feeds. The
best-performing ads feel organic, use images, and subtly mention the
product without making it the focus. To maximize success, advertisers
should use hyper-targeting, exclude irrelevant audiences, and set a
low cost cap (often $1). Videos tend to underperform, while posts with
strong headlines like “How X Did Y” drive higher engagement. 

 YOUR ONBOARDING ISN'T BAD, IT ENDS TOO EARLY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Imprint overhauled its onboarding to reduce drop-offs after the
paywall, replacing the default home screen with a personalized
learning journey. Users get custom course recommendations,
motivational nudges, and interactive tutorials to familiarize
themselves with the app. Gamification elements like XP rewards, daily
streaks, and an "Aha" moment strategy encourage users to complete two
lessons on their first day, which boosts retention.

 SPARKTORO WORKSHEET: TURN AUDIENCE RESEARCH INTO CONTENT IDEAS
(GOOGLE DOC) [8] 

 This worksheet helps you document your audience's questions, pain
points, and content consumption habits. It provides frameworks for
creating content around problems, how-to guides, and trends. The
process is organized into 4 steps to guide you from research to
content planning. 

 GOOGLE'S RSA UPDATE CHANGES THE RULES FOR SITELINKS (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Google is expanding how it creates Responsive Search Ads, allowing AI
to omit elements, mix formats, and reuse headlines as secondary
sitelinks. This update increases visibility for ad assets but also
shifts control, requiring advertisers to refine their RSA final URLs
to avoid misdirected traffic. With Google removing restrictions on
duplicate sitelink URLs, advertisers must closely monitor ad
variations in the combinations report.

 50% OF UNILEVER'S AD SPEND WILL GO TO SOCIAL MEDIA. WILL AN
INFLUENCER-FIRST STRATEGY WORK? (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Unilever's new CEO, Fernando Fernandez, is shifting the company's
marketing strategy to prioritize social-first advertising, increasing
social media spend from 30% to 50% and expanding influencer
partnerships by 20x. The company will focus marketing efforts on India
and Latin America, aiming for hyper-local influencer reach. Industry
analysts note that while this is a major shift, other large companies
are unlikely to follow at the same scale immediately. Potential risks
include influencer marketing's challenges with attribution, loss of
brand control, and consumer fatigue. Despite these concerns, the move
signals Unilever's belief that social commerce, particularly on
platforms like TikTok, will be key to future growth. 

 THE TIKTOK TV CONUNDRUM (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Despite regulatory uncertainty, TikTok continues to grow faster than
Meta and is becoming a major digital ads platform. However, its
limited presence on TV reduces the appeal to some buyers who
prioritize the channel. Meanwhile, TV networks are struggling to
integrate real-time shopping in a way that engages viewers, something
that TikTok Shop excels at. The conundrum lies in whether TikTok must
adapt to TV's format to unlock ad dollars, or if TV networks should
integrate TikTok-like commerce features to avoid losing younger
audiences. 

 NEXT-GEN GTM INSIGHTS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 B2B GTM has shifted beyond marketing generating pipeline and sales
closing it. Now, marketing, sales, product, and ops all contribute.
The MQL model is outdated, leading to wasted spend and poor targeting.
A better approach is account-based, focusing on high-fit ICP accounts
and tracking their journey with unified metrics. Companies should map
ICP accounts across key buying stages to measure progress. Marketing
can lead all pipeline efforts, including SDRs and AI-driven outreach.
