 NEWSLETTERS CONTINUE TO TAKE OFF—AND SO DO THEIR AD TOOLS (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Newsletters are considered "golden inventory" by advertisers, but
they still have issues with scale and data granularity. As ad budgets
shift toward high-engagement channels, email marketing remains a
priority for 51% of industry decision-makers this year. While direct
sponsorships and curated placements are growing, measurement
challenges still block bigger investments in the channel. 

 APPLE'S COOL MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER LOGO MASH-UPS ARE CHANGING THE RULES
OF CO-BRANDING (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple has redefined co-branding by customizing its logo for each of
Major League Soccer's 30 teams, incorporating team colors and elements
into the Apple TV logo on uniforms. This approach, part of a 10-year
streaming deal with MLS, represents a shift in logo usage, allowing
creative variations for promotional purposes. Unlike traditional logo
rules, Apple's collaboration showcases a unique merging of identities,
signaling partnership rather than just aesthetic alignment.

 TRUMP'S ORDER ON ENGLISH AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE: WHAT DOES IT MEAN
FOR HISPANIC MARKETING? (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Trump signed an executive order making English the official language
of the US, potentially removing Spanish-language content from
government websites. This could hinder Spanish speakers' access to
important information on taxes, immigration, and social benefits.

Spanish-language content can address this gap and attract more
Hispanic consumers, particularly in legal, financial, and healthcare
sectors.
