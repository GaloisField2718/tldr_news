 A CONVERSATION WITH TURO'S MATT KERBEL ON BRANDING BEING THE
MECHANISM NOT THE MESSAGE, UNLOCKING GEN Z + THE FUTURE OF CREATOR
MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Branding is no longer just about visuals. It must connect consumers
to culture and community. Companies are appointing Chief Brand
Officers to work alongside CMOs, leveraging creation, collaboration,
and community to drive consumer loyalty. Effective Gen Z marketing
requires direct engagement, representation, and co-creation. Creator
marketing thrives when brands trust creators, provide clear but
flexible guidelines, use diverse influencer types, and align content
with consumer journeys. 

 OPENAI CEO SAM ALTMAN ADMITS THAT AI'S BENEFITS MAY NOT BE WIDELY
DISTRIBUTED (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sam Altman recently discussed in a new essay on his personal blog
about making AI more accessible while addressing potential risks to
labor markets, including mass unemployment. He proposed concepts like
a "compute budget" to spread AI's benefits. Although Artificial
General Intelligence is approaching, Altman warned of its limitations
and the importance of scaling it. OpenAI aims to empower individuals
while managing the trade-offs between safety and autonomy as AI
becomes more integrated into society.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW WRITING FOR HUMANS (VS. SEARCH ENGINES) INCREASED BLOG
CONVERSIONS BY 66% TO 900% (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ranking high for bottom-of-funnel keywords doesn't guarantee
conversions if the content isn't optimized for the reader. Content
focused on search rankings can lack proper product positioning,
leading to low conversions despite high traffic. Improving flow,
focus, and product relevance can boost conversions. Strategies include
tailoring content to search intent, linking product features to pain
points, and structuring articles for engagement. Businesses should
prioritize conversions over rankings and update underperforming
content to better serve customers. 

 HOW BRANDS ARE MAKING (AND BUILDING) VALENTINE'S DAY CONNECTIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Brands are reinventing Valentine's Day marketing by combining
nostalgia with interactive experiences to boost engagement. LEGO is
offering a Botanicals Le Florist Flower Truck Tour, allowing consumers
to create custom floral designs. Coca-Cola and Raising Cane's have
transformed a drive-thru into a Tunnel of Love featuring an immersive
light show and themed giveaways. Princess Cruises is offering a
limited-time Love by Britto dining experience in New York City,
bringing onboard romance to consumers.

 GOOGLE AIO IMPACT - SEO & PPC CTRS AT ALL TIME LOW (3 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 AI Overviews (AIOs) on Google have caused large declines in CTRs for
both organic and paid search, especially for queries where AIOs
appear. Organic CTR dropped from 1.41% to 0.64% for queries with AIOs,
and paid CTR saw broad declines. However, being featured in AIOs
provides a competitive advantage, boosting CTR for both organic and
paid results. The focus should be on query segmentation, optimizing
for AIO presence, and diversifying off Google to adapt to these shifts
and mitigate CTR losses.

 HOW TO WIN IN A CROWDED MARKET (AND GET VCS TO BET ON YOU) (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 VCs avoid crowded markets due to high competition and costs but will
invest if a startup can dominate a niche and expand. Founders should
use a market wedge - targeting a small but specific segment to gain
traction. Expansion strategies include vertical growth (adding
services for the niche) and horizontal growth (expanding to similar
industries). To attract VCs, startups must show efficient customer
acquisition, deep industry expertise, and a clear plan for scaling
beyond the initial niche. 

 YOUR SUPPORT INBOX IS WORTH MILLIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Brands that embrace support-driven marketing can transform everyday
interactions into viral moments. Chewy sending flowers to a grieving
pet owner and LEGO's playful response to a lost figurine sparked
widespread appreciation. Empowering support teams with small surprise
budgets and creative freedom turns customer support into a powerful
brand-building tool.
