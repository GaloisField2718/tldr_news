TLDR MARKETING 2025-09-11

 AI VISIBILITY IS ABOUT AUTHENTICITY, NOT BACKLINKS. SOCIAL CHANNELS
ARE KEY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 While B2B marketers chase backlinks and domain authority, AI is
quietly learning from completely different sources. It turns out,
ChatGPT and Perplexity trust Reddit and Quora discussions [4]more than
your perfectly optimized landing pages.

There's a reason that Google pays Reddit $60M yearly for data, and
OpenAI pays $70M (and it's not just for the love of memes): authentic
peer exchanges teach AI how real people think, ask questions, and make
decisions. If your brand isn't part of the conversation, you're
training AI to forget you exist.

NEWS & TRENDS

 OPEN WEB “ALREADY IN RAPID DECLINE” GOOGLE ARGUES IN COURT
DOCUMENT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google argued in a court filing that the open web is already in rapid
decline, and a breakup of its ad business would accelerate that trend.
It cited AI reshaping ad tech, along with growth in formats like
Connected TV and retail media, as reasons ad budgets are shifting away
from open-web display advertising. The filing follows concerns about
“Google Zero,” the idea that Google search could stop sending
traffic to third-party sites, though Google said its AI-enabled search
still directs users to a wide range of publishers. WARC data shows
online display advertising is stable but growing much more slowly than
search and social media advertising. 

 WE'VE LOST PREVIEW TEXT FOR EMAIL. ARE SUBJECT LINES NEXT? (7 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Apple, Google, and Yahoo are replacing subject lines and preview text
with AI-generated summaries, deal cards, and groupings that override
brand messaging. These features often misstate discounts, dates, or
expirations, eroding trust and damaging customer relationships while
removing opportunities for brands to convey personality. Since neither
users nor brands can reliably opt out, the changes risk financial
loss, legal disputes, and frustration across industries.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 IS RELATIONSHIP MARKETING THE NEW MOAT? (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 With AI tools making automation and personalization widely available,
the real differentiator is how brands invest in human connection.
Relationship marketing tactics such as handwritten notes, personalized
thank you videos, and participation in virtual events help build trust
and reciprocity. Combining these with AI-driven analytics allows
marketers to tailor follow-ups that mention previous conversations and
deliver curated recommendations. These moments of authenticity promote
retention and create a durable moat in a commoditized landscape. 

 5 STEPS TO BUILDING A CONTENT CLUSTER FROM EXISTING CONTENT (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Start by identifying 2-5 core parent terms that are high-volume,
competitive, and tied to conversion. Audit your content so each URL
has one clear target keyword, even if it's not the one you rank for
yet. Group related pieces around the parent terms using your ICP
knowledge, then validate with SEO tools. Link each page to its parent
within the first 100 words and to sibling pages to share authority.
Continuously refine clusters as search intent and priorities shift.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 WISPR FLOW (TOOL) [9] 

 Wispr Flow is a voice-first AI dictation platform that converts
speech into polished, context-aware text across Mac, Windows, and
iPhone. It claims to be up to 4X faster than typing and not only
transcribes but also auto-edits, applies commands, formats, and adapts
to your style over time. It's useful for accelerating writing,
note-taking, coding, and communication through natural voice input. 

 IDEOGRAM (TOOL) [10] 

 Ideogram transforms text prompts into high-quality images using deep
learning. It is known for creating visuals with readable text, making
it useful for logos, posters, and typographic designs, while also
supporting styles ranging from photorealistic to illustrative and 3D
renderings. The freemium model allows users to generate up to 25 sets
of 4 images per day.

 WHY THE BEST PRODUCTS TELL MOST PEOPLE TO F*** OFF (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Products that polarize users often perform better than those that try
to appeal to everyone, as shown by Elden Ring, Linear, Owner, and
Superposition, which each deliberately restrict features to serve
their core audience. A dedicated 5% of users who love a product is
more valuable than 50% who find it acceptable. Founders and marketers
can employ this strategy by defining trade-offs, making products act
as filters, using complaints as marketing, measuring depth of loyalty
rather than width of reach, and doubling down on what makes a product
unique. 

 DO YOU NEED A GTM ENGINEER? (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 GTM engineers have been (over)hyped as the hottest job of 2025, but
hiring is far from widespread. Job postings remain scarce compared to
RevOps or SalesOps roles, with many companies instead outsourcing GTM
engineering work to agencies or consultants. The role blends system
design, automation, and growth experimentation, but sourcing top
talent is difficult and often limited to ex-founders or internal
transfers. As AI tools become more accessible, companies are training
existing teams to handle automation rather than relying on unicorn
hires, suggesting GTM engineering may ultimately fold into RevOps and
RevTech. 

 WILL THE ANTI-MONOPOLY RULING CRACK OPEN GOOGLE'S DATA? (7 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Google's antitrust penalties stop short of breaking up its empire but
still chip away at its dominance. The company must end exclusive
contracts, share portions of its search index and user-interaction
data with qualified competitors, and provide syndicated access to
search results across verticals. However, it avoided harsher remedies
such as divesting Chrome or Android, reinstating Exact Match in ads,
or opening up Knowledge Graph data. This article details the
implications of each of these decisions in the ruling.

 IS “WOKE BAITING” THE NEXT GREAT MARKETING STRATEGY? (3 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Woke baiting involves sparking outrage to generate headlines and
conversation, creating an uneven landscape for marketers where
backlash is loud and measurable while support is often much smaller.
