NEWS & TRENDS

 YOUNG PEOPLE GLOBALLY ARE SURVIVING MORE THAN THRIVING, FINDS STUDY
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Young adults aged 18-29 are struggling with happiness, financial
stability, mental health, and a sense of purpose. In most countries,
wellbeing improves only around age 50. Gen Z is the most financially
stressed generation, with just 28.5% feeling financially comfortable.
Yet, they still spend on things that bring joy. Flourishing is more
common among those who are married, employed, or attend religious
services. Brands that acknowledge their outlook and offer messages of
meaning or joy are more likely to resonate. 

 PINTEREST FINALLY BROKE ITS SILENCE ON THE MASS BANS, AND IT'S ONLY
MADE USERS ANGRIER (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Pinterest's delayed response to widespread account bans has made
users more frustrated. Many reported they were locked out without
explanation or clear guideline violations. Despite appeals, most
remain unsuccessful, leading to speculation about flawed AI moderation
and calls for greater transparency. Some users are now exploring legal
action, citing lost income, projects, and years of saved content.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MICRO GAMES IN MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Micro games are an effective marketing tool because they capture
attention, build emotional goodwill, and boost engagement without
overtly selling. Wiz used a cybersecurity-themed game called
Wizlympics to increase time on site and brand affinity, which helps
with SEO and trust. Files.com created a Frogger-style game for trade
shows that drew attendees in and made starting conversations easier.
Micro games work best when they are simple, mobile-friendly, subtly
branded, and used as conversation starters.

reminders of when, where, and why users signed up, triggering
recognition. The best-performing subject line was “Your Waitlist

SEO rankings.

 LINKEDIN TAKES FIRST STEPS TOWARD CREATOR MONETIZATION WITH
‘BRANDLINK' (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LinkedIn is rebranding its Wire program as BrandLink and expanding
video ad placements to include influencer content, not just premium
publishers. This move supports future creator monetization on the
platform, starting with a small group of selected influencers. Time
spent watching video on LinkedIn has grown 36% YoY, and video posts
get 1.4X more engagement than other formats. Advertisers using
BrandLink have seen a 130% higher video completion rate and 23% higher
view rate compared to standard ads. 

 REDDIT'S AI PLAY IS FOR THE GOOGLE CROWD, NOT JUST THE COMMUNITY
SCROLLERS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Reddit is scaling its AI-powered Answers feature to serve users who
come to the platform for solutions (seekers), not just community
interaction (scrollers). The tool already has 1M weekly active users
and pulls direct content from posts to create summary-style answers
that resemble Google results. This shift positions Reddit as a
search-adjacent destination, making Reddit SEO and presence management
more important for brand visibility. 

 GOOGLE TO SHOW WHO ACTUALLY PAYS FOR ADS IN NEW TRANSPARENCY UPDATE
(5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google is introducing a system that distinguishes between advertisers
running campaigns and the organizations funding them. Payer names will
be visible in ad disclosures and the Ads Transparency Center, marking
a shift toward accountability and brand clarity. Marketing and finance
teams will need to coordinate closely to ensure naming accuracy and
avoid reputational or legal risks tied to verification errors.

MINUTE READ) [12]

stand out without compromising storytelling. It aims to extend the

 COURT HEARING OFFERS A SNEAK PEEK OF POTENTIAL REMEDIES FOR GOOGLE'S
AD TECH MONOPOLY (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google may avoid a forced breakup by agreeing to behavioral fixes
like sharing real-time bid data and removing unified pricing rules
that have constrained publisher pricing strategies since 2019. These
proposed concessions could open up ad auctions to more competition and
reduce Google's influence over ad pricing and prioritization.
