Google's monopoly in US web search. It's also recommending antitrust

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DUOLINGO'S WELCOME EMAIL SEQUENCE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Duolingo's welcome series focuses on driving user activation through
streak reminders and time-efficient lessons. The emails are sent up to
twice daily, initially pushing streaks and then offering quick
3-minute lessons to minimize time barriers, with sequences pausing and
restarting if necessary. They use emotional appeals and playful
messaging to encourage users to return. 

 TEASE YOUR CUSTOMERS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Use friendly and lighthearted teasing in social media posts to
strengthen customer-brand bonds and increase engagement. Teasing ads
are perceived as up to 32.2% more "human" and boost brand connection
by up to 22.2%. Brands like Wendy's and Ryanair have successfully used
this approach to enhance relatability and engagement without provoking
negative feelings. However, antisocial or offensive teasing often
backfires, generating negative perceptions 79.5% more than positive
ads. The approach works best for playful brands and may not suit
conservative or professional industries, as humor risks appearing
unprofessional or inauthentic. Pre-test campaigns and avoid sensitive
topics to ensure effectiveness.
