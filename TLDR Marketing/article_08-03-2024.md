 GOOGLE‚ÄôS UPDATE TARGETS SPAM, BUT MARKETERS CAN STILL USE AI TO
CREATE CONTENT (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google‚Äôs latest core update targets sites that are mass-producing
low-quality content. Marketers can still utilize AI responsibly for
tasks such as drafting content and FAQS. It‚Äôs unclear if Google can

that summarizes existing content and websites creating content at an
unreasonable scale. The core update also gives paid search ads a
boost.

readership, indicating that it cannot be used as the only success
metric to assess how a post or article is performing.

 HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU BLOG (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The optimal frequency of blog posts depends on target audience
preferences, industry dynamics, and competition. If your target
audience has several questions about your products or services, a
content frequency of 4-5 blogs per week may be required. If you
operate in a specialized industry, you can turn to content creation
1-2 times a month. Tips for maintaining a regular publishing schedule
include creating a feasible editorial calendar and mastering the art
of repurposing content. Use videos to create new blog posts, combine
old blog posts to create ebooks, and convert takeaways from reports
into shareable infographics.

 THE STRATEGY SECRET OF OATLY (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Rather than answering a need, Oatly created one. Oat milk was not
desired by the general public, so Oatly used coffee culture to
establish itself. The brand created a milk that performed uniquely
well for high-end coffee, then distributed its products through
trend-leading artisan coffee shops using distinctive packaging and
branding. The company rode the growing trend of flexitarianism to
dominate the oat milk niche. Any brand can look for opportunities to
expand beyond its category and look for new audiences to sell to (who
might not even be looking for the product).
