competing. But how can you reverse-engineer strategy to put your name
on the AI-map?

NEWS & TRENDS

 PAYPAL SIGNS DEAL WITH OPENAI TO BECOME THE FIRST PAYMENTS WALLET IN
CHATGPT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 PayPal will integrate its digital wallet into ChatGPT, making it the
first payments wallet available in the AI platform. Starting next
year, users will be able to complete purchases directly through
ChatGPT while PayPal merchants list and sell products there. The
partnership positions PayPal as a key player in agentic AI commerce,
joining other e-commerce integrations with Shopify, Etsy, and Walmart.


 HOW ARE MARKETERS MEASURING ORGANIC GROWTH IN 2025? (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Measuring organic growth is becoming more complex. However,
traditional SEO metrics remain stable, with 36.5%-67.6% of teams
reporting no decline and 35.3% reporting increased trust. While 62.9%
of marketers prioritize revenue, conversion, and pipeline, only 31.8%
tie growth to business outcomes, with nearly half focusing on traffic.
Attribution is complicated by AI, causing many to misclassify
LLM-influenced demand as direct, and fewer than 20% use AI-specific
analytics. Teams that track predictive input metrics and invest in AI
attribution and GEO report higher satisfaction.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO HOST AN EVENT WITH $0 BUDGET (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator or free trials from Clay or Apollo to
build your invite list. Find a free venue, such as a coffee shop with
open seating, or organize a coffee walk. Create an event page on a
free platform like Luma to manage RSVPs. Send short, personal
invitations through the platforms your audience uses most and expect
around half of RSVPs to attend. Stay consistent even if turnout is
small, since every event builds momentum. 

 ON, MORE THAN A SHOE BRAND: MARKETING STRATEGY ANALYSIS (9 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 On's breakout success in a competitive and flat footwear market
proves that performance is not enough without emotional resonance.
While Nike and Adidas lean on scale and Hoka on comfort-first
narratives, On has carved a space that combines high-end design,
technical credibility, and cultural storytelling. On supports Olympic
sprinters, marathoners, and community leaders alike, keeping its brand
grounded and aspirational. Campaigns such as “Soft Wins” use
nostalgia and humor to make running feel inclusive, while “Run for
Each Other” highlights community bonds. These messages hit
especially well with Gen Z and millennial consumers in urban hubs.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 NEW AI-POWERED TOOLS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO CREATE AND SHARE ON TIKTOK
(2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 TikTok introduced new AI tools to make content creation faster and
easier for creators. Smart Split automatically clips, captions, and
reframes long videos into shorter clips ready for upload, while AI
Outline generates video titles, hooks, and outlines based on prompts
or trending topics. Both tools aim to simplify editing and planning so
creators can focus on creativity, and all AI outputs undergo safety
checks to meet Community Guidelines. TikTok also updated its
Subscription revenue model, allowing creators to earn up to 90% of
profit payouts if they meet engagement and posting requirements. 

 THE 8 FUNDAMENTALS OF EFFECTIVE MARKETING (73 MINUTE PODCAST) [10] 

 Advertising works by nudging memory rather than driving immediate
sales. Sustainable growth comes from increasing brand penetration, not
loyalty. Brands succeed by being mentally and physically available,
balancing long-term brand building with short-term sales activation,
and using creative campaigns that build trust. Consistent investment
and distinctive assets drive compounding growth over time.

 AI IS BREAKING THE ECONOMICS OF CONTENT (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI is disrupting the economics of content by devaluing evergreen
material like Wikipedia's while increasing the visibility and reward
for additive, insight-driven content. Wikipedia's human traffic fell
5% YoY as scrapers rose 10.5% and bots surged 162.4%, while Google
referrals dropped 35% due to AI Overviews that answer queries directly
using its content. Nearly 50% of Wikipedia's keywords now display AI
Overviews, yet it receives one-third fewer citations, while sites like
YouTube and Reddit have gained visibility and mentions. The shift
favors platforms producing net-new insights, pushing brands to reduce
evergreen content investment and focus on additive formats such as
research, thought leadership, and data storytelling. 

 ARE WE SEEING MORE COMMENT BAIT ON LINKEDIN? (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 LinkedIn's reach has dropped. About a quarter of the feed is now
sponsored, and the algorithm favors posts from people users don't
follow but whose content engages their connections. Early in the feed,
users see posts from people they follow mixed with ads and platform
features, but as they scroll, LinkedIn shifts to discovery content to
promote new creators. Regular posts get lower visibility since the
algorithm favors engagement-heavy content like job changes or layoffs,
similar to Instagram and TikTok.
