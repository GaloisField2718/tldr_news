 REDDIT INTRODUCES A NEW AD FORMAT THAT LOOKS SIMILAR TO POSTS MADE BY
USERS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Reddit revealed new free-form ads that mirror user posts, aiming to
bolster engagement and advertiser interest ahead of its IPO. The new
format will offer flexibility in content creation and quick
information delivery inspired by popular megathreads. While
advertisers may benefit from enhanced engagement, users might perceive
ads blending with regular content as intrusive. 

 ADVERTISING BUDGETS ARE SHIFTING DUE TO PRIVACY LEGISLATION, SIGNAL
LOSS, IAB FINDS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 90% of ad buyers are shifting personalization tactics as a result of
increased privacy legislation and signal loss, with ad budgets
increasingly allocated to channels that leverage first-party data,
such as CTV, retail media, and social media. One challenge marketers
are likely to face as they focus more on first-party data is a lack of
interoperability between these channels, which makes it harder to
assess effectiveness.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 USE THE ENDOWMENT EFFECT TO INCREASE PERCEIVED VALUE (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The endowment effect is when people irrationally overvalue things
once they have a sense of ownership over them. Potential customers
will value your product more if you can give them the feeling that
they own it. Free trials and test drives make customers feel this way
even though they haven‚Äôt bought anything. A money-back guarantee
allows people to truly own something with minimal risk. Giveaways make
the customer used to the paid experience. Using ‚Äúyou‚Äù or
‚Äúyour‚Äù in copywriting subtly makes the reader feel more ownership.

 WHY VISITORS ABANDON BECAUSE THEY DON‚ÄôT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY‚ÄôLL
GET (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The three most common problems with value propositions are failing to
make it clear what the product or service does, forgetting to mention
valuable benefits, and neglecting to tell your prospect what will
happen if they buy. Always use plain and clear language to describe
value propositions, particularly for complex products or services.
Ensure that all elements of value are listed on websites so visitors
understand the full benefits. Make the post-sale experience clear so
users know what to expect - this can be achieved with a future-pacing
flowchart. 

 HOW FUSING OPPOSITES CREATES VALUE FOR BRANDS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Both-ism is a cultural phenomenon where contradictory elements
coexist harmoniously, influencing trends in commerce, technology, and
social dynamics. Some examples include omni-commerce fusing digital
and brick-and-mortar, 'worcation' or 'bleisure', and alcohol-free
spirits for mocktails. Brands can offer innovative solutions and offer
novel experiences by embracing both sides of a dichotomy. 

 CORPORATE BUDGET HACKS: HOW TO FIND MORE MONEY (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This piece contains budgeting hacks and budget management tips from a
CMO‚Äôs perspective. Always budget for holdbacks and headcount
holdbacks, but do not name it a ‚Äúslush fund‚Äù or ‚Äúextra
headcount‚Äù as finance teams may eliminate them. Plan for a ‚Äúgrab
bag‚Äù for great ideas that aren‚Äôt in the budget but that could be
activated quickly if budget becomes available. This post also includes
a template for what a summary budget page should cover ‚Äî plan,
actuals, forecast, left to spend, YoY increases, and more.
