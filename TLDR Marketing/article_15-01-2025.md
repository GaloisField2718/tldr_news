NEWS & TRENDS

 TIKTOK SAYS REPORT OF POSSIBLE SALE TO MUSK 'PURE FICTION' (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A Bloomberg report suggested Chinese officials might allow Elon
Musk's X platform to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations, but TikTok
dismissed the claims as "pure fiction." During a Supreme Court hearing
last week, justices appeared inclined to uphold the legislation and
stick to the January 19 deadline for the ban. This week, two
Democratic lawmakers called on Congress and the President to extend
the January 19 ban deadline. 

 REDDIT'S AD BUSINESS IS EXPANDING—BUT IT'S STILL SMALL COMPARED TO
OTHER PLATFORMS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Reddit's advertising business is on track to hit $1 billion in
revenue in 2024 - competitors like Snapchat and Pinterest earn three
to four times as much. Reddit has been focused on bringing in new
advertisers, courting them with new ad products and features. This has
helped the platform achieve 56% year-over-year growth in ad revenue.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BAD NEWS? SEND AI. GOOD NEWS? BE HUMAN (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Use non-human bots for bad news and human-like bots with tailored
names, avatars, and tones for good news to optimize customer
satisfaction and acceptance rates. Customers are 2.6 times more likely
to accept bad news, such as higher prices, when conveyed by an
obviously non-human AI bot compared to a human-like bot. Conversely,
offers that are better than expected are 1.17 times more likely to be
accepted when delivered by a human or human-like AI bot. People
attribute intentionality to human agents or realistic bots, leading to
stronger emotional reactions to news.

products, introducing outbound sales, and aligning metrics with these
segments. Its success demonstrates the power evolving from
