about its tools ‚Äì due to its unshakable dominance in the market.

 CASE STUDY: HOW TO CREATE THE PERFECT E-COMMERCE SITE (24 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 This case study looks at the challenge of balancing brand
storytelling with effective sales strategies on e-commerce websites.
Successful sites need to merge engaging narratives with a smooth,
intuitive shopping experience. However, many brands struggle with this
balance, often focusing too much on visual appeal or functionality. As
customers increasingly arrive directly at product pages via social
media or search engines, these pages become crucial in shaping their
purchasing decisions. Many sites fall short in key areas like search
and navigation.

 WHY GREAT MARKETERS LOOK AT PIPELINE COVERAGE, NOT JUST PIPELINE
GENERATION (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 StartCo hit 105% of its pipeline generation goals, but its sales team
only achieved 82% of their new logo ARR plan, indicating a
misalignment between marketing and sales success. While marketing
celebrated exceeding pipeline generation targets, the real problem was
a decline in starting pipeline coverage, which fell from 3.1x to 2.4x
over six quarters. Great marketers focus not just on generating
pipeline but ensuring there's enough starting pipeline coverage to
give sales a fair shot at hitting their targets each quarter.

ARR and one focused solely on new ARR ‚Äî can help forecast budgets
more effectively. This method provides better insight than payback
periods for determining the budget needed to hit revenue goals.
