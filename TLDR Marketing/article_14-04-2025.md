 HOW TARIFFS ARE RESHAPING MARKETING IN THE US (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Tariffs have raised costs and slowed sales, forcing US brands to work
with smaller marketing budgets and higher performance demands. Retail
sales are expected to grow 2.7-3.7% this year, with 94% of advertisers
anticipating 6-10% budget cuts. Marketing teams are adopting agile,
performance-based strategies using real-time data and modular
campaigns. 

 META VS. THE FTC: THE BLOCKBUSTER ANTITRUST TRIAL KICKS OFF (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 More than a decade after acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp, Meta is
facing a trial that could force it to divest both. The FTC argues
these deals consolidated Meta's dominance by eliminating potential
rivals in a narrowly defined personal social networking space. Meta
counters that it competes broadly with platforms like TikTok, YouTube,
and iMessage, making the market definition itself a central issue.

 HOW TO REPURPOSE YOUR CONTENT WITH AI (8 MINUTE READ) [6]

for instructional content.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO HIRE GREAT MARKETERS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Instead of chasing "unicorn" hires, founders should split marketing
into 2 roles: a part-time strategic architect and a full-time
execution-focused builder. Companies should also form advisory groups,
build freelancer networks, and create power-user councils. Reduce
dependency on any one person and prioritize repeatable processes. 

 META ADS UNDERRATED FEATURE: WEB & APP CAMPAIGNS (1 MINUTE READ) [10]


 To use Meta's Web & App campaigns, select “Website and app” at
the ad set level and assign both your web and app destinations in the
ad. This approach unifies learning across platforms, captures all
conversion paths in a single campaign, and sends users to the most
relevant destination based on their device. It removes the need to
manage separate campaigns and resulted in a 20-60% drop in CPAs across
different accounts.

MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Gong used bright visuals, a bulldog mascot, and regional Super Bowl
ads promoted early on LinkedIn to stand out. It bought short Times
Square billboard slots, regional Wall Street Journal ads, and virtual
placements, then amplified them through social media and employee
networks to appear larger than it was. This low-cost strategy drove
record pipeline and strong brand recall. Gong also targeted content to
long-term buyers, aligned closely with sales, and focused on standout
event marketing to grow. 

 WHY SHOULD I WORRY ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY? (6 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Macro shifts are happening faster and affecting customer behavior,
budgets, and risk tolerance. With AI driving rapid change and a
recession looming, teams must reprioritize for value, not velocity.
Focus on retention, ROI-driven messaging, and features that solve
immediate needs. Collaborate with finance and GTM teams, reassess
pricing strategies, and plan with longer time horizons. Strategic
awareness is now essential, not optional. 

 I PAID $20 FOR AN AI MARKETING AGENT - AND HERE'S WHAT IT GOT ME (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI marketing agents can automate repetitive tasks and handle most of
a campaign's execution. However, they lack the nuance and empathy
needed for human-centered marketing. After spending $20 to test one,
this marketer found it underwhelming. Real success comes from
understanding people, not automating workflows.
