TLDR MARKETING 2025-09-23

 WHAT'S CHATGPT SAYING BEHIND YOUR BACK? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You're using ChatGPT and other AI tools to research products. So are
your prospects. But do you know:

	* What are they actually asking?
	* Is your brand showing up in AI answers?
	* Are the LLMs saying good things about your products when you do
show up?

Peec AI [4] has the answers. It lets you track, analyze, and improve
brand performance on AI search platforms [4] through key metrics:
VISIBILITY, POSITION, SENTIMENT.

Identify the prompts that matter. Monitor your rankings. Act before
your competitors do.

NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY YOUR LATEST ROMANCE FIND MIGHT COME FROM A BRAND (4 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Romance-driven marketing is gaining momentum as consumers seek more
uplifting content amid a heavier news cycle. Campaigns range from
Audible's immersive fan events to Neutrogena's influencer partnerships
and Doritos' humor-infused romance parodies. The approach allows
brands to test creative boundaries while connecting with consumers
looking for entertainment and positivity. 

 BRAND PURPOSE…ARE CONSUMERS AWARE TO CARE? (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Across the US, UK, and Australia, average recognition of brand
purpose sits at just 18%, and likely closer to 9% after accounting for
false positives. Nike stands out with 32% in the UK and 52% in the US,
but this reflects broad brand reach rather than purposeful messaging.
Brand purpose is unlikely to drive significant sales. Marketers should
weigh the opportunity cost versus strategies that boost brand
availability or support social and environmental causes directly.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A HACK TO GET 5% MORE LEADS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Verify emails before form submission to prevent silent lead loss.
Most missed leads come not from bounces but from mistyped addresses.
This wastes ad spend, disrupts onboarding, creates support issues, and
blocks re-engagement. One enterprise client discovered 5% of signups
had typos, resulting in thousands of lost contacts and millions in
potential LTV. Real-time verification keeps your funnel clean and
conversion-ready. 

 DON'T CALL YOUR BLOG A BLOG (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Avoid calling your blog a blog, as the term now suggests low-value
content. Instead, frame your content hub with names like Content Hub,
Research Center, Insights, or Idea Hub, depending on your business.
Audiences are less interested in generic listicles and more drawn to
unique data and insights relevant to their field.

 HOW ANTHROPIC TEAMS USE CLAUDE CODE (31 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Page 15 of Anthropic's internal guide explains how its team uses
Claude Code for growth marketing. They generate hundreds of new Google
Ads variations using specialized sub-agents, produce up to 100 social
ad creatives at once via a Figma plugin, and analyze Meta Ads campaign
performance directly within Claude Desktop. A memory system tracks
previous tests and hypotheses, enabling self-improving ad
experimentation that would be impossible to manage manually. 

 THE STATE OF MARKETING DATA QUALITY 2025 (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 CMOs estimate that 45% of the data their teams use is incomplete,
inaccurate, or outdated. Poor-quality data costs organizations an
average of $12.9M annually. 30% of CMOs view improving data quality as
the biggest lever for marketing performance, ahead of automating data
workflows and improving data democratization. The most common data
quality problems are completeness and consistency.

 I WOULDN'T HIRE A CONTENT ENGINEER, AND YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The “content engineer” role is misguided as scaled AI content
delivers diminishing returns, faces search penalties, and is easily
copied by competitors. The real opportunity lies in experimentation,
originality, and quality, with AI serving as a creative partner. As AI
fluency becomes a baseline skill for all marketers, a dedicated
engineering role is unnecessary. 

 CLAUDE'S NEW AD IS A REFRESHING TAKE ON AI BRANDING (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Anthropic launched its "Keep thinking" campaign to position its AI
assistant Claude as a creative tool rather than a threat. The
90-second ad contrasts pessimism with optimism, showing people solving
problems with Claude and framing AI as a partner in creativity. Its
warm visuals and retro style avoid the sterile feel common in AI ads.
