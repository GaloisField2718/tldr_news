 WHY AGENCIES ARE SWITCHING TO VIDU API FOR UP TO 99% COST-EFFECTIVE
VIDEO ADS AT SCALE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In the US, video ad spending is projected to reach $108.15 billion,
driving fierce competition for cost-effective content creation at
scale. Ad agencies and e-commerce teams spend $500-$20,000+ per video
on production, slowing campaigns and draining ROI. 

Trusted by brands like Lenovo and Honor, Vidu [5] MaaS API allows
teams to generate a 5-second 1080p single video [4] from just three
product images, starting at only $0.40. Featuring 500+ in-app
templates, cinematic transitions, and AI-generated sound effects, it
unlocks hyper-personalized, and culturally nuanced content at scale
and speed traditional production can't match.

 LINKEDIN RESEARCH: HOW TO WIN MINDSHARE IN THE GENAI RACE (14 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Most AI ads fail because they all sound the same and focus too much
on technical features instead of what buyers actually care about. Only
6% of ads deliver a clear point of difference, while just 11% of
buyers remember a brand or feature. Buyers tend to stick with known
vendors, considering only 2.4 brands on average, and 60% of purchases
are from existing relationships. 

 LUXURY SHOPPERS TURN TO TIKTOK FOR PRODUCT DISCOVERY (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 7 in 10 luxury shoppers on TikTok have spent over $1,355 on a single
fashion item, often after seeing peer content. About 38% discover
luxury brands through UGC, while 32% find them through creator videos.
Only 15% of shoppers buy luxury items immediately after seeing them on
TikTok, with most saving the content and purchasing later.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 5 TIPS TO MAKE IG POSTS SEARCHABLE (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Focus on clear, keyword-rich captions that reflect your content, not
vague phrases. Write alt-text for every post. Use text overlays on
Reels and images with titles, hooks, or searchable phrases. Refresh
your bio with relevant keywords, avoiding filler or outdated info. Do
light keyword research using tools like Google Trends to align with
what people are actively searching. 

 HOW TO TRAIN AI FOR BULLETPROOF BRAND VOICE: TOP TIPS AND TRICKS (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Start by setting clear guardrails using reusable prompts, live
reference docs, and layered quality control with both automation and
human review. Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation to ground AI
responses in accurate, approved information. Feed the model only
high-quality examples that reflect your voice, tagged with metadata
like audience and funnel stage, and leave out anything outdated or
off-brand. Clean your training materials of boilerplate language,
fine-tune using lightweight methods like LoRA, and test results
through blind evaluations.

 GUIDE: HOW TO CREATE WINNING B2B OFFERS THAT SELL WELL (12 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 A great B2B offer solves a problem that is painful, urgent,
recognized, and expensive for the buyer. Strong offers are proprietary
rather than commoditized and should align with market demand rather
than the creator's skill set. A successful offer includes 7 key
elements, uses front-end options to reduce friction in the buying
process, and fits into a broader portfolio aimed at increasing
customer lifetime value. Pricing should be based on the value of the
problem being solved, not the time it takes to solve it.

 WHY ADVERTISERS ARE WRONG TO SHUN NEWS WEBSITES (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Companies are pulling advertising from news websites due to brand
safety concerns, leading to revenue losses for journalism. This
movement began with the goal of avoiding ads next to extremist
content, but has expanded to block ads from serious news. 30-40% of
news stories are being demonetized, often due to outdated or overly
cautious keyword blocklists. A survey found that ads placed next to
negative news perform just as well as those placed next to positive
stories, undermining the widespread fear of negative associations.
