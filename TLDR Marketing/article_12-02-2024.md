 A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR STRUCTURING GROWTH AND PRODUCT TEAMS THAT WORK

 Having a growth organization requires a level of cross-functionality
that creates complexity. Leaders should expect more from employees in

structural and a leadership issue.

 HOW MIMECAST AND BARRACUDA ARE PLAYING THE PPC GAME (9 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Mimecast and Barracuda are top-ranked email security products that
were both founded in 2003. Both brands invested a significant amount
of money in paid advertising during the early 2020s, but their PPC
strategies have since diverged. Mimecast appears to have shifted its
investment into organic content to help boost its brand and solidify
its organic position in the SERPs. Barracuda is still investing just
under seven figures each month in paid advertising traffic to increase
visibility in the SERPs. Neither strategy is necessarily better ‚Äî it
depends on which one has a better conversion rate on this incoming
traffic.
