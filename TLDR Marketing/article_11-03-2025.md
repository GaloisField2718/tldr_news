TLDR MARKETING 2025-03-11

 ARE YOU READY TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT BRAND? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In 2025, everyone's talking about brand. But when push comes to
shove, many marketers fall back on short term tactics that are easier
to measure and justify.

data [5], in real time?

NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW CULT BRANDS LIKE CROCS, SOUTHWEST SEE INFLUENCER MARKETING
EVOLVING (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Budgets are now shifting from traditional ads to influencer-driven
campaigns. Influencers now shape campaign casting, shoppable ads, and
brand messaging. Southwest Airlines and Instacart are using
influencers to engage Gen Z, create targeted campaigns, and leverage
social commerce. Crocs has turned influencers into brand ambassadors,
using celebrity partnerships and community-driven content to grow its
cult following. Social-first strategies are now leading as digital
media and TV audiences decline. 

 CHOOSE YOUR METAPHORS WITH CARE – THEY ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU
THINK (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Metaphors have a powerful, often unnoticed impact on perception and
behavior. Studies show that describing crime as a "beast" versus a
"virus" can shift people's views on solutions, with the "virus"
metaphor increasing support for social reform. Similarly, describing
cancer as an "imbalance" motivated more positive health behaviors
compared to calling it an "enemy," which led to a more fatalistic
outlook. The choice of metaphor can subtly influence decisions,
shaping actions and attitudes in ways that may not be immediately
apparent.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EVALUATING MESSAGING ANCHORS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Leading with benefits can make messaging vague because many products
solve the same problem and promise similar outcomes. Instead,
anchoring messaging around a clear product capability often provides
the most clarity. Since website visitors scan rather than read deeply,
prioritizing the clearest message upfront improves comprehension and
chances of converting. 

 DISCOUNTS KILL GROWTH (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Frequent discounts can weaken brand perception, reduce lifetime
value, and train users to wait for deals rather than purchasing at
full price. Instead of discounting, increase the perceived value of
the product or service, refine pricing, and offer alternative deals
like extended trials. Prioritizing growth levers like onboarding,
paywall messaging, and activation yields better long-term results than
quick and short-lived revenue boosts. 

 YOUR MARKETING NEEDS MORE THAN DATA—IT NEEDS CUSTOMER SUCCESS
STORIES (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 95% of purchasing decisions are driven by emotions, and people are
22X more likely to remember a story than a fact. A strong customer
success story follows a three-act structure: defining the challenge,
presenting the solution, and showcasing the transformation with
measurable results. Using direct quotes, visuals, and multiple
marketing channels enhances engagement and impact. Brands that
leverage these stories effectively see a 20-30% increase in conversion
rates and faster sales cycles.

MINUTE READ) [13]

areas. Craft a clear narrative for the acquisition that aligns with

distinct or unify under a single brand. Integrate tech stacks - CRM,
analytics, email, and billing - for operational efficiency. Conduct a
full audit and redesign of customer touchpoints to ensure a smooth
user experience. Redirect digital assets, reforecast revenue, equip
sales for new positioning, and relaunch effectively.

 WE SPENT >$1 MILLION SPONSORING CREATORS. HERE'S WHAT WE LEARNED
ABOUT B2B INFLUENCER MARKETING (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Ahrefs invested over $1M in creator sponsorships and found that
offering free, low-friction tools helped expand its audience beyond
traditional SEO targets. Building a strong brand reputation was key to
attracting quality partnerships, requiring proactive vetting and
transparent communication. Rather than relying on surface-level
metrics, it's important to assess engagement and traffic to avoid
inflated numbers. Personalized, concise outreach through email or
LinkedIn also proved most effective for making initial connections. 

 HOW RANDOM ASSIGNMENT SAVED US $1M IN MARKETING SPEND (6 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 IntelyCare, a nurse staffing agency, tested varying bonus amounts for
clinicians. It offered random bonuses between $0 and $100 instead of a
flat $100. For nursing assistants, a $25 bonus improved completion
rates, while nurses showed a decrease with higher bonuses. This
approach saved $1M in unnecessary spending. The experiment
demonstrated the value of random assignment and controlling for
multiple comparisons. Smaller, targeted bonuses can be as effective as
larger ones.
