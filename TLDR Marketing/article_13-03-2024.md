 IS NET PROMOTER SCORE THE OZEMPIC OF METRICS? (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Ozempic both offer the illusion of
progress, addictive simplicity, and vanity. NPS can tell you how many
promoters or detractors you have, but often fails to reveal why
customers feel that way. Instead of NPS, brands should invest in
measuring Customer Effort Score (CES) and Net Dollar Retention Rate
(NDR). It‚Äôs also worthwhile to ensure that feedback mechanisms
include rigorous and random sampling methods, as well as qualitative
feedback.
