 REDDIT'S ‚ÄòFROM SEARCH TO RESEARCH' REPORT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 According to a new report by Reddit, Gen Z is increasingly turning to
personalized recommendations and trusted sources over traditional
search engines for product discovery. The generation is also
particularly sensitive to inaccurate information and lack of reviews,
reflecting their desire for trustworthy research experiences. The
report shows that Reddit is a highly trusted platform, similar to
friend and family recommendations, and highlights its unique ability
to provide reliable insights to users. 

 73% OF ENTERTAINMENT AND MARKETING CREATIVES THINK AI ‚ÄòWILL ELEVATE
CONTENT' (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A new study by the United Talent Agency (UTA) found that 73 percent
of entertainment and marketing creatives believe generative AI will
elevate content and 75 percent of those currently using AI say they
are creating higher-quality work with it. The marketing creatives in
the study were more bullish on AI than the entertainment creatives,
but not overwhelmingly so. The results from the study suggest that
these industries are shifting from fear and resistance of AI to
curiosity and cautious optimism about it.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 3 ZERO-CLICK CONTENT TACTICS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Two-thirds of Google searches end without a click, while many social
platforms suppress posts with external links. 3 tactics to create
effective zero-click content on social media: present the complete
content or solution within the social media post, which leaves the
audience with no unanswered questions and positions you as a reliable
source; tease the audience with a sneak peek of the main idea to pique
their curiosity, which incentivizes them to click-through or sign up;
and distill the essence of your content into a succinct yet impactful
summary within the post, which provides value to your audience and
compels them to navigate to the full content. 

 5 WAYS THAT WEBSITES INTRODUCE FRICTION OR BARRIERS INTO THE SALES
PROCESS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 If you've succeeded in getting your target audience to your website,
don't waste the precious seconds they'll spend on it. Avoid prompting
users to make a purchase without also providing context about your
offering, in case they aren't familiar. Only direct users to schedule
a demo if it's actually necessary for them to understand the product
‚Äî if so, explain to visitors what a demo will entail. If it's not
possible to provide specific pricing information on your site, then
explain the factors that go into it rather than simply telling users
to call to find out. Extraordinary claims (without proof) and
unrealistic stock imagery leave visitors questioning rather than
trusting. Avoid asking for information in forms that isn't actually
necessary.

 INSTAGRAM USERS ARE GETTING WORRIED ABOUT AI SCRAPING THEIR PHOTOS (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Instagram users are worried about AI scraping their photos for Meta's
AI systems, leading to posts claiming copyright over their content.
Legal experts state these posts have no effect, as Meta's terms grant
it a license to use user content. US users have limited privacy
protections and cannot opt out, while European users can due to
stricter laws. Options include setting accounts to private or deleting
data with specific commands. The only surefire way to prevent content
use in AI training is not to post it.
