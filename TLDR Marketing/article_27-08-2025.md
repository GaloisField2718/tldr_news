NEWS & TRENDS

 LINKEDIN DEEPENS VIDEO AD PUSH, TAPS MORE PUBLISHERS AND CREATORS TO
SPUR GROWTH (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 LinkedIn is expanding its BrandLink program by adding more publishers
and creator-led video shows, with sponsors including AT&T Business,
IBM, SAP, and ServiceNow. Since launching, it has brought in over 70
publishers and creators, with the number of creators on the platform
nearly doubling since 2021. BrandLink revenue rose nearly 200% in the
three months to June 30 compared to the prior quarter, while publisher
and creator payouts more than tripled year over year. Video remains
one of LinkedIn's fastest-growing formats, with uploads up over 20% by
July and views rising 36% year over year as of February. 

 NETWORKS, NOT AI OR SEARCH, ARE THE #1 TRUSTED SOURCE AMID
INFORMATION OVERLOAD (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 LinkedIn research shows professionals trust their networks more than
AI or search. 43% cited colleagues as their top source for advice, and
64% said networks help them decide faster. Rising AI expectations
overwhelm workers, as 51% feel learning AI is like taking on another
job. For brands, this means B2B buyers rely on peer insight as much as
company channels. 

 GLOBAL MARKETING LEADERS SAY THEY'LL INVEST MORE IN SOCIAL MEDIA (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 80% of marketing leaders plan to shift funds to social media as it
becomes central to customer acquisition, loyalty, and revenue. Top
platforms driving business impact are Facebook (70%), YouTube (68%),
and TikTok (64%). 87% of leaders will increase paid social spend, over
80% will raise investment in influencer and organic social, and 75%
plan to grow social team headcount, especially in SEO roles. However,
only 44% rate their teams as “expert” in measuring ROI, which is
often blamed on a lack of sophisticated reporting.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DISCOUNT COUPONS: WHEN TO GIVE % OFF VS $ AMOUNT OFF (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Percentage coupons are more effective for store-wide promotions than
fixed amount discounts. In an analysis of over 70,000 grocery orders,
percentage coupons led to 42% more customer spending, 56% larger
basket sizes, and 50% more profitability compared to fixed amount
coupons. Fixed amount coupons work better for discounts on specific
products or brands because they are easier for customers to calculate.
Very large discounts, such as 60%, can hurt sales if customers doubt
product quality. 

 ETHOS IN ADVERTISING: WHY IT WORKS + EXAMPLES (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 81% of consumers say they need to trust a brand before buying, but
only 39% trust advertising overall, creating both a challenge and an
opportunity for businesses. Ethos, which focuses on credibility,
builds trust by showing character, competence, and care. Small
businesses can use strategies like testimonials, community engagement,
founder highlights, celebrity or influencer endorsements, and awards
to establish credibility in digital advertising. Credible ads lead to
higher conversion rates, lower acquisition costs, and long-term
customer loyalty. Unlike short-term discount ads, ethos-based
marketing creates sustainable growth through trust and word-of-mouth.

click-through rate for personalized ads shown to loyal customers.

 PRIVACY-SAVVY, KID-SAFE: THE NEW PLAYBOOK FOR KIDS' ADS ON CTV (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Kids' content and co-viewing households are very valuable for
advertisers since children influence household purchases. However,
strict privacy laws like COPPA and GDPR-K, combined with the growth of
ad-supported and FAST platforms, make compliance a major challenge.
Regulators judge campaigns by likely audience, not genre, so brands
must replace data-driven targeting with context-based strategies,
creative suitability, and data minimization.
