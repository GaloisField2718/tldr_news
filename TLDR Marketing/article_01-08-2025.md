NEWS & TRENDS

 ‘SUPERINTELLIGENCE' WILL CREATE A NEW ERA OF EMPOWERMENT, MARK
ZUCKERBERG SAYS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is developing superintelligent AI to
improve social media feeds, boost creativity, and enable more
meaningful user connections. He described superintelligence as a tool
more powerful than the human brain that will enhance how people
interact, create, and build communities. Users will mainly access it
through Meta's smart glasses, which can record and process video.
Zuckerberg said the goal is not to replace human work but to empower
individuals and businesses through more advanced AI capabilities. 

 LINKEDIN REPORTS ‘RECORD LEVELS' OF ENGAGEMENT, LOOKS TO ADDRESS
ARTIFICIAL INTERACTIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 LinkedIn reported another quarter of “record engagement” with
revenue up 9% and sessions up 7%. Comments rose 30%, and video uploads
increased 20%, making video a key focus. The platform now has 1.2B
members, though only around 400M are active. Concerns remain about
artificial engagement, including pods and automation. LinkedIn says it
is working to detect and limit this activity. It's also expanding AI
tools across hiring, sales, and content creation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WIN REPORT: LESS CLUTTER, 17% MORE TRANSACTIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A cluttered product page made it hard for users to find the “Order
a sample” link, even though most testers said ordering a sample was
essential. The redesigned page simplified the layout, removed
distractions, and made the sample button more visible. These changes
led to a 17% increase in transactions and a 9% boost in revenue per
visitor. The gains came largely from increased sample orders, a key
step in the client's buying cycle. 

 HOW TO GET QUOTED IN THE PRESS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 As AI tools increasingly cite journalistic sources, getting quoted in
the press has become a way to boost visibility and search relevance.
You don't need a PR team to do it, just a clear point of view and a
smart workflow. Start by identifying the reporters and platforms that
influence your audience, then follow and engage with them
authentically. Use tools like HARO or Qwoted to find opportunities,
and send short, relevant pitches with insightful, jargon-free quotes.
Once you're featured, amplify and repurpose the coverage to extend its
impact.

 TIP: CHATGPT STATS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many stats provided by AI tools are not real but inferred. Roughly
40-50% are based on patterns from training data rather than verified
sources. This can lead to misinformation, especially when AI-generated
stats sound credible but lack a source. To avoid this, prompt AI tools
to clearly label stats as either “Verified + Sourced” with a link
and date or “Inferred” based on training trends. This step can
help ensure you're using accurate data and avoid quoting stats that
don't actually exist.

 ON WRITING “HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR CONTENT WRITING” FOR GROW AND
CONVERT AND SOLVING AN ANGLING PROBLEM (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article describes how a content piece originally aimed at
ranking for “how to become a content writer” failed to match the
search intent because it focused more on improving writing than on
job-seeking advice. The writer realized the draft reflected their own
interests rather than what the intended audience was searching for.
Instead of forcing a rewrite to match the original keyword, the editor
redirected the article toward new keywords like “content writing
tips,” which better aligned with the draft's content. This shift
involved restructuring the article around actionable writing advice,
especially emphasizing an interview-backed research process. Good
content often requires multiple revisions, and keyword targeting
should support, not dictate, the real value of a piece. 

 THE BUSINESS OF BRAND TRIPS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Brand trips can cost between 100k and 700k dollars, with most
influencers attending without additional pay, as posting is implicitly
expected. Some trips significantly boost sales, such as Hotel Lobby
Candle's Montauk event, which drove a 50% overall increase and a 419%
surge in themed product sales. Successful trips typically feature
carefully selected guests and a strong connection between the
experience and the brand's product.
