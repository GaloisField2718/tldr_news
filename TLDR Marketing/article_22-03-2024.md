NEWS & TRENDS

 THE FOMO EFFECT: WHY SPOTIFY‚ÄòS PERSONALIZATION FEATURES ARE IN THE
MARKETING SPOTLIGHT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 By tapping into the FOMO effect, Spotify's Daylist feature has
emerged as a key element in the company's marketing strategy. It
capitalized on users' desire to be part of the cultural zeitgeist
while highlighting the platform's commitment to personalization. The
move not only enhanced user loyalty, but also served as a catalyst for
broader user engagement and adoption of Spotify's personalized
features. 

 RETURN POLICIES SWAY CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A recent survey showed that return policies significantly influence
consumer behavior, with 82% of respondents saying that they consider
them when making purchases. Data also shows that in-store return rates
are notably lower than those for online purchases. Retailers should
adjust strategies to address evolving preferences to mitigate the
impact of returns on their businesses.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO WRITE COPY AS STICKY AS LEMON JUICE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Marketers need to repeat the same message to buyers several times
before it sticks. Rather than showing the same exact ad over and over,
it‚Äôs more effective to communicate the message from various angles,
with different wording and in new formats. This article breaks down an
old Schweppes ad that masterfully sells a drink with effective copy. 

 HOW TO GROW WITHOUT PAID MARKETING (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many brands get stuck in a cycle where they over-dump money into paid
marketing to keep growing. Rising CACs and saturated audiences make
this approach impossible to scale long-term. The CEO of Bobbie, an
organic baby formula brand, advocates for a 60/40 split ‚Äî 60% of
growth is your product/brand and 40% is how you get the word out.
Tactically, this means using blogs as an SEO and thought leadership
play, building processes to talk to customers directly, focusing on
garnering social proof, and finding relevant creators and communities
to drive reviews and conversations.

 HOW TO HIRE A HIGH-LEVEL INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR IN MARKETING (9
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A true high-level IC is someone who doesn‚Äôt manage a team but
manages themselves. This translates into independently making
deadlines, managing workflows, and not having to report weekly updates
to colleagues or constantly run meetings. Senior leaders don‚Äôt
manage the day-to-day of a high-level IC but are expected to have an
awareness of the types of projects the ICs are working on.

 HOW FIGMA GROWS FROM 1 TO N (29 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Figma has grown to $600M in annual revenue despite initially entering
a crowded design tool market. The founders used intuition and customer
proximity to build a product people want at a fast rate. Figma has
effectively gone from 0 to 1, so to go from 1 to N will require it to
be a product for design ‚Äì not just designers. This means expanding
beyond core offerings meant for designers and creating solutions that
more broadly serve product design and development. The company's $1B
separation fee from Adobe could be used for strategic M&A or for
building new products in-house. 

 YOUR BLOG IS NOT A PUBLICATION, BUT IT‚ÄôS NOT JUST A LIBRARY EITHER
(5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article dissects the traditional blog approach, distinguishing
between the publication and library models. The publication style
demands substantial resources and prioritizes timeliness, while the
library model champions evergreen, SEO-optimized content and depth
over volume. Use a hybrid strategy that blends elements of both models
while prioritizing audience building to adapt to the evolving content
landscape effectively.
