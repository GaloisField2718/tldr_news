more efficiently. The chat-based tool is capable of generating

 MIXED REALITY IS THE NEXT SHINY THING FOR MARKETERS, BUT SOME REMAIN
CAUTIOUS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article discusses the impact of augmented and mixed-reality
devices on advertising. Some marketers remain skeptical due to
economic uncertainties. Meanwhile, Apple and Sony are announcing new
AR and MR devices. Walmart and Qualcomm are reimagining the retail
experience with video rails on shelves and smart shopping carts. The
shift towards spatial computing can be seen as an opportunity to
create more interactive 3D ad experiences and enable
hyper-personalized and hyper-local contextual ads. Sensory advertising
could also be amplified by the rise of wearable tech.

 3 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT YOUR AUDIENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Segment your target audience into those who might need your product
in the future, those who need it but don‚Äôt want it, and those who
need it and want it. These segments should be marketed to differently.
Knowing your customers‚Äô buying dynamics also helps you prioritize
the best acquisition opportunities and set the right objectives. For
example, high-cost products will naturally have longer sales cycles
and more complex buying journeys compared to freemium products. 

 APOLOGIES WORK BETTER THAN COMPENSATION (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Customers are up to 32% more likely to forgive a mistake when they
receive an apology rather than financial compensation. Mistakes like
late delivery or a forgotten order are bound to happen. Brands should
respond by offering a sincere apology and a polite explanation for why
the mistake happened without being defensive. Research finds that this
is more effective than compensation alone. An apology helps customers
regain self-esteem after feeling disrespected and shows that a company
is considerate of their feelings.
