MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Repositioning is the process of refocusing the capabilities on the

shares Swatch's origin story. The Swiss watch industry faced a crisis
in the 80s due to the rise of Japanese quartz technology that
threatened its traditional mechanical watches. Swiss watchmakers
responded by repositioning their capabilities and creating the Swatch
‚Äî a colorful, disposable fashion accessory that appealed to a new
market segment. This successful repositioning, achieved by refocusing
internal capabilities and offering a compelling value prop, saved the
Swiss watch industry from collapsing.

 YOUR "TAM" IS WHY I HAVE TRUST ISSUES (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Most estimates of Total Addressable Market (TAM) lack analytical
credibility or real-world applicability. Quoting a massive TAM with a
top-down approach can hurt a company, especially if it‚Äôs taken from
a third-party source without any analytical rigor. An overly
simplistic calculation of price and sale quantity might seem better,
but it still lacks the appropriate depth. To complete a more accurate
TAM analysis, consider the insertion point of your product, the
relative level of competition, the market‚Äôs maturity, and the time
to capture.
