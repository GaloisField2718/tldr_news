NEWS & TRENDS

 INSTAGRAM THREADS TRIPLES DOWNLOADS IN DECEMBER (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Threads tripled its downloads month-over-month in December. It placed
in the top 10 most downloaded apps for the month across both the App
Store and Google Play. The growth was likely due to the push Meta had
given the app by displaying ads on Facebook that featured Threads‚Äô
viral posts. The app could also be benefiting from its move into the
fediverse - the social network comprised of interconnected servers
that communicate via the ActivityPub protocol. 

 UNIVERSAL MUSIC SET TO PULL SONGS FROM TIKTOK (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Universal Music Group has accused TikTok of bullying, saying the
company wanted to pay a fraction of the rate other social media sites
pay for access to its music catalog. As a result, Universal will stop
licensing its content to TikTok when its contract expires on January
31. This will remove TikTok‚Äôs access to music from artists like
Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, and Drake.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DON‚ÄôT HIDE ‚Äî MINE YOUR BRAND‚ÄôS FLAWS FOR STORYTELLING GOLD (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 All brands, regardless of their stature or intentions, have flaws.
Marketers should embrace these imperfections as opportunities for
compelling storytelling and differentiation. It creates more
human-centric content that resonates with audiences, building trust
and authenticity by moving beyond traditional messaging structures and
taking calculated risks. 

 STARTING USERS WITH PREMIUM TRIALS CAN BOOST CONVERSION (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Offering users a free trial of the full premium service on signup can
increase conversion to paid premium by up to 40% compared to offering
a freemium option that doesn‚Äôt require starting with a trial. This
is known as a reverse trial, which drops down to a freemium tier if
the trial expires. This tactic is effective because it creates a sense
of loss. The user is able to experience the full functionality of
premium, so being downgraded to the free tier highlights the new
limitations. This psychologically makes them more likely to convert to
a paid subscription.

 GOOGLE OFFERS SPECIFIC FEEDBACK ON WHY AN ARTICLE MIGHT NOT BE
HELPFUL (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Danny Sullivan, Google's Search Liaison, replied to a post on X with
very specific feedback on how to make an article more helpful. The
article in question had experienced a severe drop in traffic from
Google Search. Much of the feedback was around how information in the
article could potentially be unclear or misleading to users. The
article mentioned products that weren‚Äôt yet available, which could
be unsatisfying for users. Sullivan also called out how the article
claimed to be updated, yet included outdated information.
