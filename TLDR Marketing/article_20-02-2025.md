 GOOGLE'S NEW POLICY TRACKS ALL YOUR DEVICES WITH NO OPT-OUT (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Google's latest tracking policy now fingerprints all connected
devices, allowing it to collect hardware and software data without
user control. Google claims this method helps advertisers reach users
on platforms like smart TVs and consoles, where cookies are less
effective. However, privacy groups have condemned the move, arguing
that it grants unchecked surveillance capabilities while limiting user
control over its data. 

 27% OF CMOS REMAIN RELUCTANT TO ADOPT GENERATIVE AI (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 27% of CMOs have limited or no adoption of generative AI, while 47%
of users see significant benefits in campaign evaluation and
reporting. Among high-performing organizations, 84% use it for
creative development and 52% for strategy. Despite the hype, over a
quarter of CMOs see little impact on cost reduction, customer service,
and scalability. Only 4% of marketing teams have fully integrated
generative AI.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DIGITAL TO PHYSICAL: THE SHIFT FROM URL TO IRL (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The shift from URL to IRL is redefining brand connections, as
audiences crave immersive experiences over passive engagement.
Consumers want to share their real-world moments online, making
everyday touchpoints key to brand impact. Instead of massive
activations, smart brands enhance what people already love—like
branded coffee sleeves at local cafes, co-working workshops, or
digital-first events. Limited-time experiences drive immediate
participation and lasting social buzz, proving that impact matters
more than scale. 

 3 WEBSITE HACKS FROM RAMP'S HOMEPAGE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ramp's homepage lowers bounce rates by directing CTAs to informative
pages instead of pushing demos too soon. It keeps the top half light
for quick scanning while adding details like value propositions and
case studies further down. Features come first, helping visitors
understand the product before seeing real-world impact through
customer case studies instead of broad claims.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO TELL A CONSISTENT STORY, USING PERCEPTIONS TO SHAPE YOUR
NARRATIVE (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To tell a consistent brand story, businesses need to define clear
"perceptions" that guide all marketing efforts. Perceptions are the
core narratives your audience should associate with your company and
reflect market trends, your mission, and product philosophy. Companies
should limit perceptions to 3-5 key statements to avoid scattered
messaging and ensure they are both unique and memorable. Use
perceptions to plan content, shape campaigns, and align all messaging
to avoid random marketing efforts. Consistently reinforcing these
perceptions over time is key to building a cohesive and recognizable
brand identity. 

 HOW TO CONDUCT A WEBSITE AUDIT (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This guide explains how to review your site to assess its
performance, UX, and alignment with business goals. Prioritize
technical issues like site speed, broken links, and mobile
responsiveness. Perform an SEO audit, focusing on keyword
optimization, meta tags, and on-page elements. Evaluate content for
relevance and engagement, addressing outdated material or gaps. Assess
user experience using tools like heatmaps to understand behavior and
improve navigation, ensuring your site drives conversions and meets
expectations.

 WE NEED MORE INTELLECTUALS IN ADVERTISING (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Marketing is often viewed with disdain by intellectual circles, but
it plays a critical role in shaping society by influencing public
perceptions on social issues and politics. Liberal politicians have
struggled to capture public attention and in turn, have lost ground to
those who master marketing techniques. To promote truth, equality, and
progress, intellectuals and nonprofits must embrace marketing
strategies similar to those used by corporations. Shaping cultural
priorities through effective storytelling and communication is
essential to driving positive societal change. 

 THE GOOD, BAD, AND UGLY OF SAAS PRICING CHANGES (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Pricing shifts in SaaS are accelerating. There were 126 price changes
and 213 plan adjustments across leading companies in 2024. Loom moved
from AI add-ons to an AI-specific tier, Pipedrive adjusted plan
positioning to nudge customers toward its Professional tier, and
Ahrefs quietly raised its Enterprise pricing. The shift toward
outcome-based pricing is gaining traction, as seen with Confluence's
automation rule limits and Chili Piper's add-ons tied to sales
processes. 

 HOW PING-PONG – AND A SMART BIT OF MARKETING – IS CHANGING LIVES
(3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Croatian composer Nenad Bach, who lost the ability to play guitar due
to Parkinson's, regained his motor skills after regularly playing
ping-pong at Spin, a table tennis club. His recovery inspired Game of
Hope, a film directed by Spin co-owner Juan Carlos Ortiz, which Bach
also scored. Ortiz, with experience at DDB and Leo Burnett, embedded
this story into Spin's brand, shifting from traditional advertising to
storytelling that highlights real-life impact. Spin now offers free
tables and supports the PingPongParkinson foundation, promoting
ping-pong as therapy for Parkinson's, with 70-85% of players reporting
improvement.
