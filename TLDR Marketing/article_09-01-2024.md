COOKIES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google Chrome plans to eliminate third-party cookies by Q3 2024, but
some sites will still be able to temporarily enable them until
December 27, 2024. Eligible websites can enable the third-party cookie
deprecation trial by using JavaScript to provide unique access tokens
in Chrome. The program is specifically designed for embeds and

eligibility criteria. 

 7 GTM PREDICTIONS FOR 2024 (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Expect to see more companies leveraging partnerships not just for
market penetration but as a precursor to strategic acquisitions this
year. There will also be an increased demand for integrated tools, an
emphasis on nurturing smaller deals for growth, and a surge in
fractional leadership roles post-layoffs. Authenticity will remain

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CASE STUDY: THE PRODUCT PAGE REDESIGN THAT PRODUCED A 56% INCREASE IN
DESKTOP ORDERS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An online retailer redesigned its product pages with the goals of
creating a more modern design and streamlining the checkout process.
This involved creating a new page layout and introducing a sticky
‚ÄòAdd to Cart and Buy Now‚Äô bar. On desktop, the redesign resulted
in a 56% increase in order completion rate and a 33% increase in
revenue per visitor. The redesign did not make a significant
difference on mobile, suggesting mobile user behavior and preferences
don‚Äôt align with those on desktop. 

 DOVETAIL‚ÄôS LINKEDIN AD BREAKDOWN (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post includes a visual breakdown of a LinkedIn ad by Dovetail, a
customer insights hub. The ad text copy speaks directly to the
company‚Äôs target persona. The creative illustrates the target‚Äôs
pain point and makes it memorable. The bottom section of the ad that
contains the CTA should be used to incorporate a closing argument (ie.
the product‚Äôs benefit or capability).

 ALIGN YOUR MARKETING STRATEGY WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS‚Äô JOURNEY (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Marketers without a strategy that is closely aligned with their
customers‚Äô journies fail to generate engagement and conversions
because their targeting is too broad. To be successful, have a clear
target audience and prioritize the leads based on where they are on
their journey. The priority should be those with a high ROI, such as
customers who are ready to buy today or soon, followed by those who
bought an alternative and those who may be ready at some point in the
future.
