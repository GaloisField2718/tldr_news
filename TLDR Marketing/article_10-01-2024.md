 NO, WOMEN DON‚ÄôT PREFER PRETTY PRODUCTS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Both men and women tend to believe that women prefer design over
functionality. However, women do not prioritize looks when they choose
products for themselves. Brands should focus on making products better
(e.g. more comfortable sneakers) rather than ‚Äúprettier‚Äù (e.g. more
stylish sneakers) when marketing to women. 

 1M ARR DOESN‚ÄôT MEAN YOU‚ÄôRE READY TO SCALE (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Most founders and VCs assume that $1M in revenue means a company is
ready to start hiring more salespeople and investing more in marketing
programs. However, a company is only ready to scale if that revenue is
coming from the same customer segment or use case. If not, the brand
does not have product market fit. Instead, it has initial traction
towards several different versions of product market fit.
