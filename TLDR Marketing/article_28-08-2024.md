NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY TIKTOK IS FULL OF TELESHOPPING RIGHT NOW (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 It's almost impossible to scroll through your For You Page without
coming across a live video where you're being directly sold to ‚Äî
akin to the '90s shopping channel QVC. These streams give users
community interaction, advising each other in the comments, as well as
a celebration moment when someone makes a purchase in front of
hundreds of other users. Many businesses in China, the UK, and the US
have turned to this sales format via TikTok Shop, as social media
users are increasingly willing to make purchases directly through the
app. 

 SOCIAL MEDIA SIGNALS 2024 (20 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This deck highlights how younger audiences (18-25 years old) are
reducing social media usage, shifting the focus to niche,
interest-driven interactions. It discusses TikTok's growing role as a
search engine for Gen Z and the rising importance of longer content
formats. The deck also emphasizes the need for brands to create
serialized, scalable content across multiple channels and the power of
"weak ties" in niche communities to build loyalty.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 6-STEP EMAIL SEQUENCE TO TURN SUBSCRIBERS INTO BUYERS (1 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 To convert subscribers into customers, start with a Welcome Email to
introduce your brand and deliver the opt-in offer. Then create a Story
Email sharing your brand's background. Next, send a Problem Email to
highlight the issue your product solves and follow up with a Social
Proof Email showcasing testimonials or case studies. An Incentive
Email with a discount can then encourage purchases, and wrap up with
an Urgency Email to create a sense of urgency. This sequence works for
both eCommerce and personal brands. 

 BEST PRACTICES FOR EMBEDDING VIDEOS IN EMAIL (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When embedding videos natively in emails, ensure your video file is
under 10MB. Choose a thumbnail with a clear focal point and a
prominent play button to entice clicks. Optimize your email for
various clients by setting up fallbacks, particularly for platforms
like Outlook that have limited video support. Include strong visuals
and concise storytelling to capture attention quickly, and always test
how your video performs across different email clients.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 JUMP LINKS IN GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Links with hashtags represent jump links, which will appear in Google
Search Console reports when they are displayed on the search result
page. Only use the count of search impressions for the main URL, as
the impressions for these jump links are essentially double counted.
This reporting is helpful though to see how often the jump links are
displayed and clicked. 

 HUBSPOT AI SEARCH GRADER (TOOL) [10] 

 HubSpot's AI Search Grader analyzes how visible your brand is in
AI-powered search engines. Enter 4 fields describing your company to
see a brand sentiment score and share-of-voice score. An optional
email form unlocks additional reporting, including more detailed
sentiment scoring, brand strengths and weaknesses, and competitor
analysis.

 SO YOU'VE BEEN ASKED TO ‚ÄúHUMANIZE‚Äù AI CONTENT (5 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Searches for ‚Äúhow to humanize AI content‚Äù have grown 943% over
the last 12 months, but doing so is an inherently flawed process. By
the time you've researched and added in the human element, you may as
well have created the content from scratch yourself. This type of
request is also demoralizing for writers, especially when paired with
an unrealistic deadline. Companies should use AI models to ideate,
plan, and outline content ‚Äî not ghostwrite it. 

 THE LOSING TEST THAT LED TO 4% MORE LEADS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This article discusses an A/B test on CTA anchor text that initially
failed, but eventually led to a 4% increase in leads. The test
compared 3 variations: a control, a version with "free" added, and a
more descriptive option. The best practice of adding "free" caused a
drop in conversion rates, likely due to users associating it with
spam. However, the descriptive option that included the product name
in the CTA improved conversions, especially among new visitors.

 TELL PROSPECTS WHAT WILL HAPPEN ‚Äì NOT WHAT TO DO (1 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Don't write headlines that read like orders - instead, make a
specific promise that takes the work off your prospect and puts it on
your product. 

 EXCLUDE BOT CLICKS IN KLAVIYO (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Inbox providers use bots to verify email links, which give a false
measure of engagement - enable the "bot clicks" feature in Klaviyo
email settings to get more accurate data.
