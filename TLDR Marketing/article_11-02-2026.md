 STATE OF DIGITAL PR REPORT (2026) (38 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Digital PR is more effective in 2026 but also more difficult due to
AI search and rising demand for brand authority and mentions. 68.2% of
professionals say it is more effective than last year, yet 75% say it
is more challenging, and 60.8% say finding relevant journalists has
become harder. Data-led content remains the top tactic at 95.9%, press
release pitching rose to 85.1%, and 66.2% now list AI citations as a
key outcome, while backlinks still lead at 85.8%. Budgets are rising,
as 8.8% now spend over $20,000 per month, and cost per link above $750
grew from 3% to 10.2%, while 60% still spend under $10,000. AI now
shapes daily work, as 76.4% say it changed their process, 78.4% track
AI visibility, and only about 40% have a repeatable method to earn AI
citations. 

 VALENTINE'S DAY SHOPPING IS BECOMING A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP TEST (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Valentine's Day has evolved into a multi-week revenue cycle driven by
relationship signals rather than a single promotional spike. Brands
began referencing the holiday in early January, with messaging volume
steadily increasing and accelerating nearly 3 weeks before February
14, mirroring shopper behavior that favors early exploration and
delayed commitment. The strongest performers used early engagement to
gather intent data, then converted that accumulated interest closer to
the holiday without relying on aggressive discounts.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DESIGNING FOR THE AI INBOX: WHY HTML EMAILS WILL WIN THE NEXT ERA OF
E-COMMERCE (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI is summarizing emails before recipients open them. Image-only
emails risk having offers misrepresented or ignored. HTML emails with
live text and dynamic content improve visibility and deliverability.
They load faster and provide data for optimization. Front-loading key
offers, using headings, balancing text and images, and sticking to
email-safe fonts ensures both people and AI can interpret messages.
Well-coded HTML turns AI summarization into an advantage. 

 HOW DORITOS AND ULTA USED TIKTOK CLUBHOUSE AS A SUPER BOWL
SECOND-SCREEN POWER PLAY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Clubhouse strategy reflects a broader shift in Super Bowl
marketing toward giving control to creators and meeting Gen Z where
attention already lives. Doritos' prior Super Bowl activations drove
35% year-over-year growth in brand mentions and added more than
200,000 TikTok followers, reinforcing the business case for
creator-led second-screen investment. While TV ads still anchor mass
reach, TikTok Clubhouse shows how brands are using real-time,
off-broadcast experiences to influence discovery and brand perception
outside of game day and the traditional channels. 

 HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR OWNED CONTENT FOR AI SEARCH (11 MINUTE READ) [9]


 LinkedIn outlines a practical framework that balances AI optimization
with core SEO fundamentals to avoid ranking losses. Key tactics
include disciplined heading hierarchies, internal linking through
hub-and-spoke models, schema markup such as FAQPage and Product, and
consistent recency signals like visible “last updated” dates.
Visuals, video transcripts, and optimized PDFs act as additional
discovery signals, while early testing shows month-over-month gains in
brand mentions and citations, reinforcing that AI visibility is now a
measurable extension of owned-content performance.

 HOW I BUILT AN EMPLOYEE ADVOCACY SCOREBOARD WITH DIRECTUS, ZAPIER,
AND CLAUDE CODE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This guide explains how to build an automated employee advocacy
scoreboard that tracks team social sharing. Links posted in Slack are
detected and cleaned using AI in Zapier, then stored in Directus as a
structured backend. A Claude Code–scaffolded Next.js dashboard
displays the leaderboard, with monthly filtering and drill-downs. The
system streamlines tracking posts on LinkedIn and X and reduces manual
work. 

 POPL (TOOL) [13] 

 Popl captures leads at live events by replacing manual processes with
an AI-powered workflow. Reps scan badges or QR codes with the mobile
app, instantly enriching contact and company data, qualifying leads
with custom questions, and syncing everything to the CRM. The platform
also allows on-floor meeting scheduling and tracks event ROI, giving
full visibility into pipeline and rep performance.

 WHY DIGITAL TWINS ARE MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY MODEL (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Digital twins are high-fidelity 3D assets that go beyond visuals.
They can be reused across marketing and ecommerce and support AR and
internal workflows. This provides consistent branding and reduces the
need for repeated photography or 3D builds. The assets evolve with
products and save time and cost while maintaining accuracy. For
marketers, digital twins offer long-term value. They enable
interactive content and scalable campaigns. They also integrate across
platforms and serve as a central resource for teams. 

 HOW SOLOS TURN CHEAP PROBLEMS INTO PREMIUM BUSINESSES BY RAISING THE
STAKES (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Solos are independent consultants and agency owners running expertise
driven businesses. Those who moved upmarket did so by changing their
problem framing and signals. They replaced failure states like no
leads or no revenue with success plus constraint, what was working but
capped. They also shared methodology instead of quick tips, used
diagnostics to signal rigor, and showed proof tied to scaling
outcomes. This filtered for mature buyers seeking partners, not quick
fixes.
