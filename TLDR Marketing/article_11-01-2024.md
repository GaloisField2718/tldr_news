 HOW A SITE-WIDE BENEFITS BAR INCREASED TRANSACTIONS BY 8% (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 JUMiNGO, a German shipping platform, saves customers up to 80% by
passing on wholesale discounts from partners like UPS and DHL. It
initially struggled to get new users to try its platform. Research
uncovered that potential users were concerned about being locked into
a long-term commitment. Less than 50% of desktop visitors scrolled to
the site's ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù section or saw the full explanation of
benefits. As a solution, JUMiNGO's team created a sitewide benefits
bar below the site header, highlighting the lack of subscription or
monthly fees. This resulted in an 8% increase in transactions.

 Stanley grew sales from $70M in 2019 to $750M in 2023, offering a

 WHAT‚ÄôS WRONG WITH GROWTH HACKING? (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article discusses 3 main problems with the current conception of
Growth. First, it‚Äôs become too focused on acquisition and
consequently overlooked retention, activation, and pricing. Second, it
focuses on short-term hacks or shortcuts instead of scalable growth
models. Lastly, it lacks a multidisciplinary approach that includes
