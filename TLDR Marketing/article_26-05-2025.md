NEWS & TRENDS

 AI IS CHANGING SHOPPING. WILL CONSUMERS BUY IN? (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Tech companies and payment services are betting AI will transform
online shopping with personalized product comparisons, virtual
try-ons, and AI agents that can purchase with user permission. While
AI chatbots save time, consumers remain skeptical about recommendation
accuracy and privacy, especially around payments. Retailers must adapt
as AI may not always highlight their products, creating risks but also
chances for smaller businesses if results rely less on ads. 

 GEN Z IS WILLING TO SELL THEIR PERSONAL DATA—FOR JUST $50 A MONTH
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Gen Z spends nearly 7h/day on their phones and is willing to sell
their personal data for about $50 a month by sharing their browsing,
buying, and streaming habits. About 88% of Gen Zers say they're open
to sharing some personal data with social media companies if fairly
compensated, compared to 67% of older adults. While more willing to be
tracked, they still take privacy steps like clearing cookies and using
anonymous browsers twice as often as other generations.

 10 UNCONVENTIONAL THINGS I'M DOING TO GROW MY NEWSLETTER (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Tom Orbach grew his newsletter using creative tactics like handing
out branded stress balls as ice breakers, adding shareable
infographics to emails, and engaging with followers by offering free
marketing advice in comments. He collects unsolicited positive
feedback for social proof, sends personalized LinkedIn messages to new
connections, and places small bets on emerging projects. Orbach
leverages Substack recommendations by promoting other writers,
launches creatively on Product Hunt, boosts successful LinkedIn posts
with ads, and focuses on practicing marketing daily over just writing
about it. 

 EXPLORING R/HUBSPOT'S TWO-PRONGED MODERATOR STRATEGY (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 HubSpot built a customer-success engine on Reddit through a two-part
moderation approach. A volunteer expert, Ryan Gunn, provides
transparent, knowledgeable engagement, while the branded support
account u/HubSpotHelp is managed by employees. The subreddit, with
over 13K subscribers, acts as a space for education, peer support, and
product feedback. Gunn's credible responses help build trust and
influence product decisions, while u/HubSpotHelp adds value through
AMAs, direct support, and highlighting key concerns.

 DISCORD ENTERS THE AD ARENA (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Discord has over 200M monthly active users and is now testing
unskippable, reward-based video ads. These ads only play when users
are actively watching and are tied to in-game perks, ensuring full
engagement. With interest-based targeting and opt-in personalization,
Discord is positioning itself as a low-noise, privacy-conscious ad
environment for brands targeting younger audiences.

 IT'S NOT THAT 'PEOPLE DON'T LIKE CHANGE', IT'S THAT YOUR LOGO ISN'T
AS GOOD AS THESE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 People don't resist design changes, they resist poor design. Rebrands
like Twitter to X, HBO to Max, and Jaguar's new logo failed because
they discarded strong brand identities for bland and confusing
replacements. In contrast, successful rebrands from Adobe, Google, and
Kleenex showed thoughtful evolution that respected brand heritage.
Good design simplifies, clarifies, and feels natural, while bad design
does the opposite. 

 THE LOYALTY PROGRAM ILLUSION: WHY POINTS DON'T EQUAL PREFERENCE (6
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Points-based loyalty programs often give the illusion of success
while hiding low engagement and weak brand connection. Most repeat
behavior stems from habit or convenience, not true preference. These
programs reward actions that would happen anyway, inflate ROI with
misleading metrics, and fail to build emotional ties. High breakage,
unused rewards, and low redemption rates show customers aren't
invested. Enrollment is often automatic, not a sign of interest. To
create real loyalty, brands need simpler, more relevant experiences
that reflect how people actually choose. 

 WHY CEO BRANDING IS THE NEW MARKETING STRATEGY (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 CEO branding is now important for trust, recruitment, and investor
appeal, especially in startups. 93% of people believe socially active
CEOs build stronger customer connections. CEOs like Jensen Huang and
Elon Musk prove that a visible, intentional presence can shape public
perception and drive business results. For impact, a CEO's voice must
align with the company's values and be consistently expressed across
platforms with clear strategy and measurable outcomes.
