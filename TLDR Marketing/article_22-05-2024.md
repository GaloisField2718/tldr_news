 COUNTERFEIT GOES COOL: HIGH-END BRANDS URGED TO EMBRACE RISE OF #DUPE
(4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The rise of #dupe culture, driven by Gen Z's acceptance and promotion
of cheaper alternatives to luxury products, is reshaping consumer
behavior. Social media experts suggest that high-end brands should not
fight this trend but rather use it to engage with a wider audience and
strengthen their brand image. Brands like Lululemon and Olaplex have
already seen success by incorporating dupe culture into their
marketing efforts. 

 PINTEREST'S GEN Z MARKETING REPORT (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pinterest shared a series of insights on marketing to Gen Z based on
first-party platform data and recent audience research. Gen Z is
Pinterest's fastest-growing audience, making up more than 40% of its
global monthly users. This generation uses the platform as a search
engine, so brands should optimize their Pins for Pinterest search. Gen
Z saves nearly 2.5x more Pins and makes 66% more boards than other
generations, which means upper-funnel and retargeting campaigns can
set the stage for lower-funnel success. 63% of weekly Gen Z Pinners
say that they're ‚Äòalways shopping,' so brands should take advantage
of ad formats like carousels and collections with direct links.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 7 COMMON AND COSTLY PRODUCT MESSAGING MISTAKES‚ÄîAND HOW TO AVOID
THEM (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Powerful product messaging is the backbone of a good marketing
strategy. Your website should speak to one specific persona, not a
range of segments. Instead of showing a long list of features on your
homepage, it should describe the desirable transformation your product
will create. Strong customer success stories, case studies, and any
other third-party validation will bring validity to lofty promises.
Moreover, a compelling and authentic brand personality goes a long way
in differentiating your brand. 

 THREE NEW RULES TO CREATE CUSTOMER LOYALTY (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article outlines strategies for enhancing customer loyalty
through personalized interactions, consistent service, and proactive

and exclusive offers. Consistency involves delivering reliable
experiences across various channels. Proactive engagement focuses on
anticipating customer needs and resolving issues before they escalate,
achieved through monitoring customer behavior and feedback.

content-driven nurture. It involves asking questions before building
your sequence, deciding on the type of content relevant to your
audience (ie. a playbook, case study, framework), and incorporating
content into every single email and followups. A sample of an email
drip series is included.

 WHAT'S A MARKETING FUNNEL AND HOW TO USE IT TO OPTIMIZE YOUR WEBSITE
CONVERSIONS (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Funnels come with a lot of nuances and are non-linear and
non-time-bound in nature. Every business needs to define and optimize
its own funnel uniquely. To optimize a marketing funnel, set a purpose
for each stage of it and use data to understand what's not working.
Build marketing strategies for each stage, keep refining your buyer
personas, and audit your marketing assets.
