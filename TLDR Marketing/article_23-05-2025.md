NEWS & TRENDS

 YOUTUBE VS TIKTOK, WE ANALYZED 3.5 MILLION VIDEOS (6 MINUTE READ) [4]


 TikTok is still dominated by short-form content. Over 55% of ranking
videos are under 30 seconds, while longer videos have difficulty
gaining traction. YouTube supports both short and long-form videos,
maintaining 15+ minute videos at 20% of rankings, but mid-length
videos are declining. Engagement on TikTok remains consistently high
across all video lengths due to its personalized algorithm, whereas
YouTube engagement varies greatly depending on content type and
duration. Creators should tailor content to each platform's strengths,
using TikTok for short, engaging videos and YouTube for a wider range
of formats. 

 HURRY UP AND WAIT: TOP MARKETING TAKEAWAYS FROM NETLINE'S 2025 B2B
CONSUMPTION REPORT (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Content demand hit a record 7.9 million registrations in 2024, but
the average time to open content stretched to nearly 39 hours, a 23%
increase year over year. Playbooks showed strong buying intent, being
115% more likely to lead to a purchase within 12 months, while eBooks
were less predictive of near-term decisions. Short-term purchase
intent dropped 12%, while mid-term intent rose 15%, emphasizing the
need for well-timed follow-ups over immediate responses. C-suite
engagement rose 27%, but marketers must respect varied buyer
timelines, focusing on presence, relevance, and patience.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOMEPAGE TRAFFIC IS UP 10.7% FROM AI OVERVIEWS AND LLMS (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A study of 50 websites by Siege Media found that AI Overviews and
LLMs lower overall site traffic but increase homepage visits by 10.7%
on average. Some saw nearly 30% more clicks. This rise comes from
stronger brand visibility in bottom-funnel AI search results that
boost branded searches even without direct links. Established brands
benefit most, while others struggle. Siege recommends optimizing
homepages, enhancing retargeting strategies, investing in brand
building, and focusing on brand awareness to leverage this shift
effectively. 

 CREATING SHARE-WORTHY INSTAGRAM CONTENT THAT OUTPERFORMS (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 One Instagram share can lead to anywhere from 150 to 400 additional
views, significantly outperforming likes, comments, and saves. This
makes share-worthy content the most effective way to reach new
audiences and drive organic growth. Marketers should focus on formats
like motivational stories, highly specific relatable posts, timely
cultural tie-ins, and opinion-driven takes that promote conversation
and sharing.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

optimize their visibility across AI-driven search platforms. Teams can

 Splashin turned the classic high school game "Senior Assassin" into a
