NEWS & TRENDS

 THE STATE OF SHORT-FORM VIDEO IN 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Short-form video dominates social media. Overall video volume is up
71% and accounts publishing is up 51% YoY. TikTok leads growth - video
is up 156% and engagement is up 35% despite lower reach. Instagram has

 WHY SOUTH KOREA'S GEN Z WANT AMERICAN BRANDS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Over 60% of South Koreans in their twenties use an iPhone, compared
with 86% of those in their fifties and sixties who own a Samsung
Galaxy. Younger consumers favor American brands due to cultural
influence, social media, and the sense of style and freedom associated
with California. This shows that cultural narratives and aspirational
values strongly influence buying decisions, and that US-linked
branding can resonate even amid political or economic tensions. Family
influence and study abroad experiences further shape these
preferences.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND SUPERHUMAN'S EMAIL MARKETING SUCCESS AND
PRODUCT-LED GROWTH (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Superhuman turned email into a premium productivity tool by reframing
it as a status product for high performers. It targeted founders,
executives, and professionals who get 100+ emails a day and who value
speed and signaling as much as functionality. Superhuman fueled growth
through an exclusive waitlist, one-on-one onboarding, and features
that create natural visibility, such as read receipts and built-in
referral loops. Its $30 monthly price reinforces its premium
positioning and helps it build a loyal base that sees the product as
part of their professional identity.

 UNDERSTANDING THE REDDIT MOD: A MARKETER'S GUIDE (11 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Reddit moderators' control determines whether brand content survives.
They're unpaid volunteers who act as gatekeepers and enforce rules
through tools such as AutoMod, moderation queues, and user activity
reviews. The platform uses extensive metadata and AI systems to detect
spam, manipulation, and ban evasion. Moderator power has created
tension across the platform: there was a period when five users
controlled 92 of the top 500 subreddits, and the 2023 blackout led
Reddit to impose new limits on moderator authority. 

 INSIDE CROCS MARKETING: WHAT THEY DO DIFFERENTLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA (12
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Crocs recorded over 2M total social engagements between September and
November. Its strategy included regional social media pages,
multilingual content, and collaborations with figures relevant to each
market. Limited-edition releases, humorous posts, and nostalgic
moments like the Big Comfy Couch partnership generated visibility and
attracted diverse audiences. 

 WHY I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT PERFORMANCE VS. BRAND MARKETING (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Early confidence in performance marketing grew from clean models,
sharp targeting, and data that looked definitive. Over time, those
signals proved misleading because they measured only what was easy to
track and ignored business fundamentals. Hyper optimization created
smaller and smaller pools of buyers and slowed growth. Lasting scale
comes from reach, memory, and broad availability. Performance still
matters, but it works only when paired with steady brand investment
from the start.
