NEWS & TRENDS

 COLLECTIBLES - CONTINUING TO TAKE THE TOY CATEGORY BY STORM (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Collectibles, especially those based on manga, anime, and video
games, are driving toy industry growth, appealing to both kids and
adults. Classics like Star Wars figures remain popular. Brands like
LEGO, Warhammer, and Magic: The Gathering continue to thrive. Anime's
rise in the West, fueled by platforms like Crunchyroll, has boosted
demand. Brands like Bandai Namco and PopMart have made collectibles
widely accessible. With adults sustaining demand, collectibles are set
to remain a major industry trend. 

 THEY SAY WE DON'T LIKE SEX, DRUGS, DEMOCRACY, OR DIY. BUT HERE'S HOW
WE IN GEN Z REALLY FEEL (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Recent surveys suggest Gen Z struggles with DIY tasks and leans
towards radical political views like favoring strong leadership or
revolution. This reflects disillusionment with a broken social
contract, where job prospects, healthcare, and community support seem
out of reach. Despite these challenges, Gen Z is motivated by a desire
for change and authenticity, driven by frustration over unfulfilled
promises and a need for improvement in society and personal
connections.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 7 YEARS OF GOOGLE ADS EXPERIENCE IN 12 HIGH-IMPACT LESSONS (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Focus on mastering the fundamentals of Google Ads to see success,
including optimizing offers, landing pages, campaign structure, and
conversion tracking. Avoid “Shiny Object Syndrome” by staying
disciplined and not chasing unnecessary trends. Success often comes
from actions outside of Google Ads, like improving offers and sales
funnels. Automation is not the enemy - learn to leverage it for better
results. Specializing in one niche, like e-commerce, can accelerate
mastery. 

 ANATOMY OF A KILLER B2B CASE STUDY (2 MINUTE READ) [7]

and include a TL;DR sidebar for quick takeaways. Structure the story
using the Storybrand framework, positioning the customer as the hero.
Highlight layered challenges to add depth, and use colorful quotes to
humanize the story.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE'S FILTERED DATA ISSUE (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When you apply a query filter to Google Search Console data, Google
immediately hides a large percentage of clicks for 'privacy,' which
are not included in totals. Use filtered data to get an idea for a
trend (ie. "branded clicks are going up/down"), but not for precise
data. 

 REDDIT PAYWALLS TO HIT THIS YEAR AS PAID SUBREDDITS CONFIRMED (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Reddit CEO Steve Huffman confirmed that paywalled subreddits will
launch this year. Following its 2024 IPO, Reddit raised API fees and
made licensing deals with Google and OpenAI to allow web crawler
access. Reddit is also planning a long-term marketplace feature for
buying products through the platform. 

 APPLE MAPS PAID SEARCH ADS COULD TRANSFORM LOCAL BUSINESS MARKETING
(4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Apple is reportedly evaluating paid search ads in Apple Maps, giving
brands a new way to appear at the top of local search results. With
over 100M US users, Apple could challenge Google's dominance in local
search advertising while maintaining its privacy-focused approach.
This move would enable businesses to bid on keywords like “coffee
near me” and potentially offer exclusive deals.

 LESSONS FROM BEYOND MEAT AND IMPOSSIBLE FOODS' MARKETING MISTAKES (10
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods failed to differentiate their
brands, assuming plant-based protein was a strong enough selling point
without clear messaging. Their pricing strategy remained misaligned
with consumer expectations, and they overlooked how deeply ingrained
food language influences purchasing decisions. The perception of
"processed" food worked against them, as they failed to position their
products as both convenient and reassuring. Without addressing
freshness, ease of mind, and comfort in their branding, they missed
key opportunities to build trust. 

 AI MIGHT RAISE THE FLOOR, BUT IT ALSO LOWERS THE CEILING (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 AI is making media more data-driven, with 79% of ad spend expected to
be algorithmic by 2027. While it improves efficiency and identifies
patterns, it also risks making marketing look the same. Just as
AI-generated stories often blend together, AI-driven campaigns can
become indistinguishable without human creativity. Marketers need to
act as algorithm architects, combining AI capabilities to support
brand, relationship, and business goals instead of relying solely on
automated platforms.
