COMPANY RESPONDS TO BACKLASH (2 MINUTE READ) [6]

 HOW TO WRITE THE PERFECT COLD EMAIL (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The more your cold email looks like it wasn't even meant for the
recipient, the higher the chances they'll read it and respond. 7
psychological hacks to write casual emails that get replies: internal

 PAYWALL STRATEGY: DESIGNING FEATURES THAT MAKE MONEY (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Revenue stagnation can be addressed by focusing on designing features
for distinct user personas rather than adding features for existing
users. This involves breaking down the user base into different
segments based on their motivations and needs. Addressing the unique,
high-value problems of each user group can lead to the creation of
solutions that are indispensable to users, thereby increasing their
willingness to pay and stay subscribed.

feedback on their draft Reels clips before they post them publicly.

 Google Ad Manager (GAM) has quietly published documentation for a

 HOW THE 'BUY BUTTON' HOOKS YOU (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Twitter and Facebook both failed to integrate a ‚Äòbuy button' into
their platforms. Instagram took a different approach that succeeded.
Rather than merely adding a button to ads, Instagram designed
sponsored content to blend in with real user content. It also gave
users the option to browse the advertiser's inventory, as opposed to
just being able to buy the one item being promoted. Users are not
visiting social media sites to shop, so the success of this feature
hinged on the platform understanding its users' psychology.
