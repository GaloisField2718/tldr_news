 BRAND ASSOCIATIONS: HOW TO PLANT YOUR BRAND IN CUSTOMERS' MINDS (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Branding is creating associations in people's minds, as Aston Martin
did when it associated its car with the cool and stylish James Bond.
Types of brand associations include the experience of the
product/service, hard brand attributes like logos or jingles, soft
brand attributes like repeated messaging, and news stories that stick
with the brand. Build the right brand associations in customers' minds
by having an intentional and consistent message, avoiding making
negative associations worse with poor handling, and sticking to fewer
messages that you repeat often.
