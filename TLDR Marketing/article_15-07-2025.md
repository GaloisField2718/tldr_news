MINUTE READ) [6]

found that 87.8% of pages cited were a mix of human and AI content,
with only 8.6% purely human and 3.6% purely AI. This contrasts with

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 5 ONE-CLICK GOOGLE ADS SEGMENTS TO SAVE YOUR BUDGET (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 To find and fix wasted spend, use 5 segment views available in the
standard Google Ads interface. Check network performance to detect
spikes in low-quality search partner traffic. Review conversion
actions to focus on valuable goals. Evaluate ad assets to reveal true
extension performance. Analyze keywords to improve ad relevance and
message match. Examine device data to audit user experience and
optimize landing pages. 

 LOVABLE'S LOADING SCREEN (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lovable uses a growth tactic that turns its loading screen into an
opportunity to showcase key features while users build their site.
Instead of a blank screen or progress bar, it highlights what users
can do with the app. Lovable captures attention during a typically
idle moment and effectively educates new users about its capabilities.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 INSTAGRAM TRIAL REELS ARE NOW AVAILABLE TO MORE CREATORS (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Instagram's Trial Reels let creators test Reels with non-followers
before publishing them widely, helping assess content quality without
follower bias. Only users with at least 1K followers and a public
account can access the feature, which can be toggled on in the Reels
composer. Trial Reels do not appear to followers or on the creator's
profile unless published, but still generate engagement metrics within
24 hours. Creators are using the feature as a “growth hack” to
repurpose older content and gain reach. 

 MOBILE APP MARKETERS SHOULDN'T IGNORE THE BIGGEST SCREEN IN THE HOME
(2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Connected TV (CTV) offers high-impact reach with nearly 50% greater
exposure per impression than mobile. It enables precise audience
targeting using behavioral and contextual data and supports testing of
various creative formats to optimize performance. CTV campaigns can be
optimized for cost per install and return on ad spend, with unified
measurement across devices through third-party partners. Early tests
show CTV can boost mobile conversions significantly, making it a
full-funnel tool.

 PATRÓN JUST SHOWED US WHAT PURPOSE REALLY IS AND WHAT IT CAN DO FOR
BRANDS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Brand purpose is often misunderstood as superficial CSR. However,
when it's tied to brand positioning, it drives results. Patrón proves
this by standing against additives in tequila and staying committed
despite regulatory pushback. Elf Beauty shows purpose through its
focus on making beauty accessible to everyone, which appears across
products, campaigns, and events. Specsavers uses its tagline to
reinforce brand positioning through humor. All three show that
purpose, when done well, is simply effective long-term marketing. 

 ADVERTISERS WIN, USERS LOSE IN AN INSTAGRAM SPIN-OFF (2 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 If Meta is forced to sell Instagram, the split would benefit
advertisers but likely harm users. Ad prices would drop as Facebook
and Instagram compete, leading to more frequent and repetitive ads on
both platforms. Facebook would retain a competitive edge due to its
larger audience, pushing Instagram to serve even more ads at lower
prices. While the divestiture may boost ad competition, it would not
increase user benefits under the FTC's current market definition. 

 THE BOWTIE: A CUSTOMER-CENTRIC FRAMEWORK FOR A RECURRING REVENUE
BUSINESS (26 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The classic marketing and sales funnel focuses on customer
acquisition through awareness, education, and selection, but ends
before recurring revenue begins. Its key limitations include being
seller-centric, linear, and lacking feedback loops, which makes it
ineffective for subscription-based models. The Bowtie model addresses
these gaps by extending the funnel with stages like onboarding,
adoption, and expansion, placing emphasis on delivering customer
impact rather than just promised value.
