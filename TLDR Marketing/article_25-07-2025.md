NEWS & TRENDS

 PR TRENDS: THE SHIFTS YOU CAN'T IGNORE IN 2025 (9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 LinkedIn has overtaken X as the top social platform for journalists
in 2025, making it the most effective place for PR professionals to
build relationships. Despite some rise in DM-based outreach, 96% of
journalists still prefer to receive pitches via email. Journalists now
value exclusives more than original research and prioritize access to
credible sources over story ideas or data. Irrelevant pitches are
increasing, with 47% of journalists saying they seldom receive
relevant outreach, and response rates continue to decline as pitch
volumes rise. With ongoing layoffs and more journalists moving to
independent platforms like Substack, PR professionals must focus on
relevance, personalization, and consistency to cut through the noise. 

 THE ART & SCIENCE OF VIDEO STORYTELLING (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Video is now the primary format for B2B marketing. LinkedIn video
viewership rose 36% in 2024, and video posts are shared 203% more than
other content types. 5 key creative principles drive success: Cultural
Coding, Human Touch, Expert Takes, Attention Hacking, and Inspiring
Imagination. Videos with expert speakers increase dwell time by 31%,
human-centered content boosts engagement by 18%, and authentic,
emotive videos see up to 84% higher engagement. 

 PEW RESEARCH: GOOGLE USERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO CLICK ON LINKS WHEN AN
AI SUMMARY APPEARS IN THE RESULTS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Users are less likely to click on links when Google shows an
AI-generated summary, with only 8% clicking on a search result
compared to 15% when no summary appears. Just 1% of visits to AI
summary pages result in users clicking links within the summary
itself. About 26% of users end their browsing after seeing a summary,
compared to 16% for pages without one. Longer and question-based
searches are more likely to trigger an AI summary, with 60% of
question-word searches and 53% of 10-word-or-longer searches producing
one.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE CASE FOR ZERO-CLICK CONTENT IN A ZERO-TRUST ECOSYSTEM (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Platforms now suppress outbound links, hide referral data, and hoard
traffic. This makes traditional click-based marketing unreliable.
Instead of chasing clicks, zero-click content delivers standalone
value directly in-platform. Links aren't off-limits but should be used
sparingly, supported by consistent value-driven content. Success can
be measured through branded search lift, audience growth, and
conversions like booked demos. 

 THE POWER OF IDENTITY: BUILDING LIFELONG CUSTOMERS (10 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The strongest loyalty comes from brands that reflect how customers
define themselves and what they care about most. Identity marketing
involves researching how customers talk about their struggles and
aspirations, validating those themes through real-world feedback, and
naming identity groups with deeper meaning rather than surface-level
slogans. When customers feel that a brand helps express who they are
and what they believe in, they become voluntary ambassadors who spread
the message out of pride and alignment, not obligation. 

 PASSIONATE EMPLOYEE > FACELESS LOGO (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Instead of prioritizing your company LinkedIn page, identify a
charismatic employee to serve as your public voice. People trust
individuals far more than brand logos, and employee-led content builds
a stronger audience connection. Ideal candidates often have public
speaking experience, creative backgrounds, or represent
underrepresented groups. Support them with a ghostwriter, feature them
on your company page, put them on stages, and compensate them
accordingly.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 CHATGPT USES GOOGLE SERP SNIPPETS FOR ITS ANSWERS (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 A test confirmed that ChatGPT relies on Google Search result snippets
for its answers. A newly published webpage, not submitted to search
engines, couldn't be located by ChatGPT even with web search enabled.
Gemini, in contrast, fetched the live content directly. Once the page
was indexed in Google but not yet visible in search results, ChatGPT
still failed to access it. Only after the page appeared in Google
SERPs did ChatGPT provide a partial response, clearly drawn from the
Google snippet rather than the actual page. This shows ChatGPT's
dependence on Google's indexed summaries, not direct page access. 

 WHEN USING AI BOTS TURNS CUSTOMERS AWAY (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Customers are 23.7% less likely to continue using a service when it
is provided by AI instead of a human if warmth is important. The drop
in preference is stronger when the service is associated with fun or
pleasure, with a 29.8% decrease in usage intention, compared to 17.5%
when the focus is on efficiency. AI is perceived as 19.5% less warm
than human staff, but using informal language helps reduce this
effect. Companies like Henn na Hotel and McDonald's abandoned full AI
setups due to poor customer response, while hybrid models like
Starbucks' app chatbot have been more successful.

 SLACK'S ACQUISITION SPREE: 6 PURCHASES IN 6 YEARS TO COMPETE WITH
MICROSOFT AND GOOGLE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Slack used a buy-over-build strategy to quickly match the features of
Microsoft and Google by acquiring six companies between 2014 and 2020.
These acquisitions helped it add tools like screen sharing, document
collaboration, and email integration, allowing it to scale to 12
million daily active users by the end of 2020. Its 2018 deal with
Atlassian eliminated competitors HipChat and Stride and led to over 11
joint integrations. By acquiring technologies that reduced
context-switching, Slack positioned itself as a unified work hub and
ultimately attracted Salesforce, which acquired it in 2020. 

 WHAT EXPLAINS GOOGLE'S RECORD QUARTERLY SEARCH REVENUE WHILE CLICKS
DECLINE & SITETRAFFIC DROPS? (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The introduction of AI Overviews has changed the search funnel by
addressing early research queries without requiring user clicks. As a
result, fewer users proceed to external sites, but those who do are
more likely to convert and are being monetized at higher rates, with
CPCs rising nearly 13%. This model has enabled Google to grow search
revenue significantly despite reduced traffic to third-party websites.
