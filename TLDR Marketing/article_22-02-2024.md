NEWS & TRENDS

 AMAZON FREEVEE APP REPORTEDLY SHUTTING DOWN IN FAVOR OF ADS ON PRIME
VIDEO (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Reports suggest that Amazon may be discontinuing its free
ad-supported streaming platform Freevee following the introduction of
ads on Prime Video. Launched in 2022 as a rebrand of IMDb TV, Freevee
offered a vast library of content without the need for a Prime
membership. The move, if confirmed, would align with Amazon's shift
towards a three-tiered model for Prime Video that will include free
ad-supported content, an ad-supported subscription, and a premium
ad-free tier. 

 RESEARCH SHOWS INFLUENCERS WITH SMALLER FOLLOWINGS ARE MORE
COST-EFFECTIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Research indicates that nano-influencers, despite their smaller
followings, deliver higher ROI for direct-to-consumer (DTC) firms
compared to macro-influencers. The finding challenges the notion that
larger followings equate to higher ROI. Results can be attributed to
the intimate connection smaller influencers have with their followers.
Marketers are encouraged to adopt a nuanced approach to influencer
selection, considering factors beyond follower count to maximize the
effectiveness of their campaigns and drive revenue growth.

 THE 4 U'S OF EYE-POPPING HEADLINES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 8 out of 10 people will read your headline, but only 2 out of 10
people will read the rest of your copy. To write better headlines, you
have to incorporate at least one of the 4 U‚Äôs: unique,
ultra-specific, urgent, and useful. Using analogies, surprising words,
or sexy sentence structure can make your headline unique. Conveying an
immediate benefit or highlighting the cost of not taking action
creates urgency. More tips are available in the article.

 ARE YOU BLACKER THAN CHATGPT? (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Creative ad agency McKinney developed a quiz game called ‚ÄúAre You
Blacker than ChatGPT?‚Äù to shine a light on AI bias. The game tests a
person‚Äôs knowledge of Black culture against what ChatGPT has been
trained to know about the Black community. It playfully exposes
ChatGPT‚Äôs limitations, revealing blind spots in understanding
cultural nuances not well-documented online. The initiative aims to
address the lack of diversity in AI development.

 HOW TINDER USES BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tinder began in 2012, developed its swipe feature in 2013, and by
2019 had 5.2 million paying subscribers and $1.4 billion in revenue.
It uses gamification techniques like reward screens and variable
rewards to release dopamine and make the experience exciting. The app
gets around the paradox of choice by focusing users on a single
profile with simple left-or-right decision-making. Brands should avoid
overcomplicating the user experience to a point where the value ends
up getting lost. 

 HOW AGENCIES ARE TRYING OUT AMAZON PRIME VIDEO ADS (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Amazon has debuted ads on Prime Video, enticing brands like Samsung,
Tinder, and New Balance with its large audience reach. Media buyers
have been shifting ad spending from TikTok and YouTube to test Prime
Video ads‚Äô effectiveness. Despite potential legal issues, marketers
are drawn to Prime Video‚Äôs intent data, competitive pricing, and
compatibility with third-party verification partners.
