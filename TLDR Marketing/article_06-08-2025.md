NEWS & TRENDS

 SPAM HAS ESSENTIALLY MIGRATED FROM EMAIL INTO THE FEED (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 AI-generated content is flooding social platforms, turning them into
the new inbox. They're now overrun with noise and generic output.
Brands that succeed won't be the ones pumping out the most content,
but those using AI with intention, creativity, and a clear point of
view. Speed matters, but so does direction. To stay ahead, brands need
flexible systems that blend technology with human insight. Without
this, automation will drown out authenticity, and feeds will only get
more cluttered. 

 THE MIDWEST IS THE MOST SOCIALLY INFLUENCED REGION IN AMERICA (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Influencer culture is now a national norm. 92% of Americans and 98%
of Gen Z follow at least one influencer category. The Midwest stands
out as a key driver of this trend, with cities like Des Moines,
Detroit, and Chicago showing the highest levels of engagement. Des
Moines leads the country in hair and beauty followers at 27%, compared
to 16% nationally, and ranks third in health and wellness. These
cities are not just adopting trends but shaping them across food,
fashion, parenting, and gaming.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BRAND TONALITY: YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Every brand already has a tone, whether it was intentionally chosen
or not, and it shows up in places like emails, landing pages, and
error messages. When tone is inconsistent or unintentional, it creates
confusion and weakens trust, making your brand feel generic or
unreliable. Auditing recent customer touchpoints helps uncover what
your tone is actually communicating before it shapes the wrong
impression. 

 UNGATED LEAD GEN TACTIC FOR LINKEDIN (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Create PDF documents that solve painful problems for your audience.
Test them organically and promote the best ones using LinkedIn's
document ad format with an engagement goal. Give away the full
document for free instead of gating it. Add a clear marketing offer at
the end.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 A COMPLETE JSON PROMPTING GUIDE FOR MARKETERS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 JSON prompting gives AI tools clearer instructions by using a
structured format with labeled fields and values. This method improves
consistency and reduces errors, while also turning repeated tasks like
writing ads or captions into reusable templates. It works well for
structured content such as newsletters, personas, and batch social
media posts. Not all AI tools handle JSON well, but those that do
produce more accurate and reliable results when given consistent
patterns. 

 REDDIT SEO GUIDE TO INCREASING BRAND VISIBILITY IN GOOGLE IN 2025 (9
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Reddit acts as both a real-time keyword lab and an off-platform SEO
driver as users search subreddits for reviews and niche advice.
Companies can get more exposure by identifying high-ranking threads,
lightly contributing to conversations before launching their own posts
using question-based titles and long-tail keywords. A phased approach
is recommended since organic participation is essential to building
presence in the community and establishing topical authority without
coming off as fake engagement.

 PERPLEXITY'S MARKETING STRATEGIES (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Perplexity is an AI-powered search engine that prioritizes trust by
showing sourced answers instead of traditional link lists. It reached
a $14 billion valuation and 780 million queries per month by targeting
students, professionals, and researchers. Its ad model uses
AI-generated sponsored follow-up questions and charges $30 to $60 CPM,
but advertising still makes up a small part of its revenue. Perplexity
drives growth through influencer campaigns, creative brand moments
like its Super Bowl tweet contest, and media partnerships. However, it
faces scaling, ROI, and content licensing challenges as it competes
with larger platforms. 

 5 MARKETING BEST PRACTICES I DON'T FOLLOW (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Strict consistency in content schedules is overrated because
audiences rarely notice timing. Strong, directive CTAs are not always
the most effective, as placement often matters more than wording.
Rather than only using positive language, brands should use more
honest messaging that acknowledges user frustrations. Rigid adherence
to meta description limits and KPIs is overrated because well-written
titles and intuitive action often matter more than arbitrary metrics
or patterns. 

 “GIRL MATH” ISN'T JUST FOR GIRLS: IT'S A GROWTH STRATEGY IN
DISGUISE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Many consumers treat spending as a game they can win by stacking
promo codes or reaching free shipping thresholds. The emotional
satisfaction of unlocking a deal outweighs the actual discount itself,
influencing decisions across age groups and income levels. Klaviyo
data confirms that this mindset is strongest among Gen Z at 74% and
Millennials at 68%.
