NEWS & TRENDS

 THE RISE OF THE NARROW STARTUP (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Consumer software is shifting from mass-market, ad-supported models
to high-priced, hyper-focused products known as Narrow Startups. These
apps serve specific user groups such as engineers, developers, or
creatives through premium $200 per month tiers that exist within
broader platforms. Instead of scaling to millions, these startups
thrive with small, dedicated user bases by delivering deep value for
niche needs. 

 FOR RETAIL AND DELIVERY, ADVERTISING IS BECOMING BIG BUSINESS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Retail and delivery ad revenues now exceed 10 billion dollars
annually and are growing near 20%. Platforms such as DoorDash and
Instacart are using first-party data and AI to offer more targeted
advertising to thousands of brands and merchants. Profit contributions
from media are helping major players offset costs and stay
competitive.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WIN REPORT: 13% INCREASE IN SALES WITH A SIMPLE CHANGE TO A PRODUCT
PAGE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 House of Worktops increased sales by 13% and revenue by 24% by
changing how it presented its delivery checker on product pages. The
original form sat above the main call-to-action and caused distraction
during a key decision moment. Replacing the form with a simple
clickable link reduced cognitive load while keeping the feature
accessible. The change made the page cleaner and helped more users
move forward without unnecessary friction. 

 THE ROI OF EMAIL MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Email marketing delivers strong ROI, with 35% of companies earning
$10 to $36 for every $1 spent and 30% earning between $36 and $50.
Customer engagement emails, promotional emails, and newsletters
generate the highest returns depending on the industry. Retail sees
the highest ROI at 45:1, followed by marketing agencies at 42:1 and
tech at 36:1. Companies measure email impact using metrics like
customer engagement (59%), conversion rates or MQLs (44%), and direct
revenue attribution (41%). To improve ROI, marketers should run A/B
tests, use personalized and interactive content, and leverage
analytics tools and pre-send testing.

 IS RRF THE SECRET TO DOMINATING AI CITATIONS? I DECODED CHATGPT'S
RANKING FORMULA (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is an information retrieval method that
combines scores from multiple related searches into a final ranking.
It rewards pages that consistently rank across many queries, showing
that topical authority and comprehensive coverage outperform narrow
keyword targeting. Analysis of ChatGPT's code confirms it uses RRF,
explaining how AI evaluates relevance across variations of user
intent. This shows why SEO remains essential and why building topic
clusters matters. Consistent visibility across related topics will
outperform isolated top rankings.

 ATTENTION IS THE LAST SCARCE RESOURCE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Attention is becoming the most valuable and limited resource in the
digital economy. Platforms like TikTok now dominate consumer behavior,
with Gen Z spending 108 minutes per day on the app, contributing to
declining interest in traditional media like The Late Show. As
AI-generated video and real-time tools like Mirage flood the internet
with content, attention spans shrink, and the cost of capturing
attention rises. To adapt, companies are expanding into new
attention-friendly mediums like voice and using new business models
such as subscriptions and microtransactions to extract more value per
user. 

 CAN MY NIECE DESIGN A BETTER POSTER THAN YOUR CREATIVE AGENCY? (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Effective poster design follows two simple rules: use distinctive
brand elements that light and non-brand buyers recognize, and make
those brand signals large enough to be seen, especially by viewers
passing quickly. Many praised minimalist outdoor ads succeed only
because they get these basics right, while others fail by making
branding unclear or too small. Research shows strong brand presence
greatly improves recall. Simple, clear branding wins in limited
attention environments, proving fundamentals matter more than complex
creativity.
