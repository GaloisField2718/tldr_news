 PINTEREST FINALLY ADMITS MASS BANS WERE A MISTAKE CAUSED BY AN
‘INTERNAL ERROR' (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pinterest has publicly apologized for the account bans and Pin
removals that users said were unwarranted. While the company denied AI
was at fault, it admitted to over-enforcement of content policies and
has begun reinstating affected accounts. Many users are still
frustrated with the delayed response and poor communication.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GRAZA'S CORE CUSTOMER LIFECYCLE JOURNEY (FIGMA FILE) [6] 

 This file maps out the lifecycle journey of Graza olive oil. Graza's
playful, educational design extends across all touchpoints, making
even a two-SKU offering feel dynamic. To reduce churn, the brand
offers flexible subscription options and discounts, and even lets
users gift a shipment to friends. It also engages customers with
content like recipes and product tips, using education and referral
incentives to boost loyalty and encourage continued use. 

 WHEN SHOULD YOU DO A WEB OR BRAND DESIGN? (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Redesigns should be driven by significant changes in business
strategy, not by trends, leadership changes, or vague dissatisfaction.
Without a solid brand foundation, a redesign will fail to deliver
results. In many cases, a focused update or content refresh is more
effective than a full rebrand. Companies must clearly define the
problem they're solving and choose external partners based on gaps in
their internal team, not just budget. Web and brand overhauls can cost
from $10K to over $500K, depending on stage and scope, and even with
outside help, significant internal effort is still required. To avoid
generic results, teams need alignment, strong brand strategy, and a
willingness to evolve rather than overhaul when possible.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 YOUTUBE INTRODUCES AN INTERACTIVE PRODUCT FEED FOR SHOPPABLE TV ADS
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 YouTube is rolling out a new shoppable TV ad format that places an
interactive product feed on the right side of the screen during ads.
Viewers can use their remote to scroll through featured items and
choose a product to either scan a QR code for direct purchase or press
a button to send the full shopping link to their phone. The format is
designed to align with dual-screen behavior and convert passive ad
viewing into active shopping.

 LESSONS FROM 25,000 SPLIT TESTS BY THE TOP TECH COMPANIES (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Across thousands of SaaS tests, only 10% of revenue-focused A/B
experiments deliver better results than the control. Tactics such as
illustrated or semi-opaque backgrounds, reassurance subtext below
CTAs, and linking customer logos to case studies consistently generate
positive results, but brands continue to adopt other losing ideas. In
high-profile cases like GoDaddy and Talkdesk, AI-heavy messaging lost
in tests but was still adopted widely, showing strategic decisions can
often be driven more by perception, internal alignment, or investor
storytelling than by user response. 

 AI POWERS EXPEDIA'S MARKETING EVOLUTION (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Marketing at Expedia Group has become increasingly data-driven. AI
now supports everything from lifetime value modeling to large-scale
content creation. Generative AI tools have boosted productivity and
helped adapt to shifting consumer behaviors, especially as younger
users move away from traditional search. The company is also exploring
AI agents to simplify travel planning and strengthen customer
relationships through programs like One Key. Cross-functional teams
and a culture of experimentation have enabled faster content
production and deeper AI fluency without needing machine learning
expertise.
