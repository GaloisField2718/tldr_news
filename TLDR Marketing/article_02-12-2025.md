NEWS & TRENDS

 GEN Z SHOPPERS AREN'T SPENDING LIKE RETAILERS NEED THEM TO (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Gen Z is cutting holiday spending far more than other generations.
They plan to reduce budgets by an average of 34% as rising rent,
student loans, and everyday costs strain finances. This pullback
contrasts with overall US holiday sales. Younger shoppers are hunting
for deals, choosing cheaper dupes, buying secondhand, or making gifts,
creating pressure for retailers who expect this group to drive nearly
20% of spending within 5 years. 

 MOST INSTAGRAM USERS OVERESTIMATE THEIR ADDICTION TO SOCIAL MEDIA USE
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A large study of US Instagram users found that only 2% show clinical
signs of addiction, even though 18% believe they are addicted. Most
heavy use reflects habit, not addiction, yet media narratives push the
addiction label and shape user perceptions. When researchers framed
Instagram use as addictive, users reported lower control and more
self-blame. The findings show frequent use is common, but true
addiction is rare and often overstated by both users and media
coverage.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 5 CAMPAIGNS TO ADD TO YOUR 2026 CONTENT CALENDAR (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Strong content strategies blend category evangelism, marketing
transparency, advisor collaboration, first-party data, and creative
stunts. Educate the market on why old methods fail, share launches and
experiments, and reveal behind-the-scenes insights. Engage advisors
with shareable, exclusive content, and use product and customer data
to challenge trends or produce industry reports. Capture attention
with playful stunts, parodies, and unexpected uses of your product. 

 THE NEW MARKETING DASHBOARD IN THE AI ERA (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 B2B marketing has always relied on SEO, paid ads, and automation.
However, AI is reshaping those pillars. SEO is shifting into LLM
visibility, paid clicks are up an estimated 50% to 100%, and budgets
are moving toward harder-to-measure brand efforts. AI also unlocks
automated prospecting, qualification, and seller enablement that speed
deal cycles and improve close rates. To reflect this shift, teams need
dashboards that track influence, demand, and revenue impact rather
than legacy metrics.

 CHATGPT JUST BECAME A PERSONAL SHOPPER. IS YOUR STORE READY? (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ChatGPT's new Shopping Research feature transforms the AI into a
personal shopper. It guides users through product discovery,
comparison, and decision-making. It also collects preferences,
budgets, and needs, iteratively refines recommendations, and pulls
live product and retailer data. The AI evaluates product pages, ranks
options, provides personalized buying guides, and explains trade-offs.
This makes structured, complete, and consistent product data
essential. Brands need to clean and standardize data and strengthen
PDPs.

 HOW US MERCHANTS FAIL EU CONSUMERS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 US merchants often misread Europe as one unified market. However,
consumer habits, languages, and trust cues vary widely. Germany favors
detailed specs, strict return clarity, and payment after delivery.
France prioritizes native language, brand storytelling, and culturally
aligned presentation. The Nordics expect seamless mobile commerce and
clear sustainability details, while Southern Europe is more price
sensitive and focused on reliable delivery. Merchants need to tailor
payments, logistics, and branding to each country.

AI-assisted shoppers 38% more likely to buy. These tools were
especially influential in high-volume categories like electronics and
toys.
