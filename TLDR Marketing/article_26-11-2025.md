NEWS & TRENDS

 RETAIL CATEGORY STRATEGIES FOR YOUTUBE (19 MINUTE READ) [4]

electronics generate 688B views across 4.12M channels. Creators drive
shopping behavior through reviews, tutorials, and short-form

 HOW BRANDS ARE AIMING TO BUILD ‘ALGORITHMIC TRUST' AHEAD OF AN AI
AGENT-POWERED BLACK FRIDAY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Brands are working to build algorithmic trust so AI agents can
surface their products during a longer, AI-driven shopping window.
Most consumers have used AI tools at least once. 68% report trying
tools like ChatGPT, but only 2% use AI to make purchases, which shows
a large gap that brands want to close. New tools such as Pulse and
Atlas from OpenAI may speed adoption by proactively presenting
personalized deals to shoppers. Brands are responding by encoding
product data for machine understanding, strengthening verifiable brand
values, and improving online reputation so AI agents can confidently
recommend their products.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TURN INSULTS YOU GET INTO ADS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Reusing unfair insults can boost brand engagement and ad performance
because it makes a brand seem more confident and humorous. Experiments
showed that an electronics store increased its CTR by 26.7% when it
embraced an insult, and MTV saw a 25% rise in interest, a 70.5% lift
in humor, and a 20.2% increase in perceived confidence when it reused
criticism. Vitamin Water saw similar gains, including a 67% rise in
humor and a 21% rise in confidence. The approach fails when the critic
is seen as vulnerable, as perceptions of a brand being a bully can
rise by 59.9%. 

 REDESIGN OF PROTON.AI'S CUSTOMER NEWSLETTER (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post shows how Proton's newsletter moved from plain text to a
sports-themed design. It introduced a mascot, used ChatGPT to build
the HTML layout, and tested the code in Parcel to confirm it rendered
well. The prompt used is shared in the comments. 

 WORKFLOW DRIVING 23% OF B2B PIPELINE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bolt.new uncovered 23% of net new B2B pipeline, driven by Freckle.io.
They enriched personal email sign-ups from high-potential companies.
The workflow imported sign-ups from Snowflake, filtered personal and
work emails, enriched contact and company data, scored and prioritized
Tier 1 leads, and pushed them to HubSpot with LinkedIn engagement
steps. In the first 4 weeks, this generated $1.7M in pipeline,
including Fortune 500 deals, and the process has now been expanded to
all demo requests.

 PROMPT LIKE A MARKETER (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This guide gives a structured way to craft AI prompts by focusing on
signal context, roles, jobs, formats, and tone. It shows how to use AI
across key marketing tasks, offers reusable templates tied to real GTM
scenarios, and helps teams turn buyer signals into clear outputs. It

 AI EMAILS ME CONTENT IDEAS EVERY MORNING (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article explains how to set up a system where ChatGPT sends a
daily email with categorized content ideas. The prompt pulls insights
from past chats and organizes them into buckets for newsletters,
LinkedIn, and email. Anyone can replicate the method by enabling
ChatGPT schedules and applying a structured prompt. This reduces
context switching and protects ideation from being lost in
unstructured notes.

 HOW TO DO USER RESEARCH WITHOUT USERS: THE SYNTHETIC USER GUIDE (7
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI-generated personas give early-stage teams a fast way to clarify
who they are building for and what those users care about. Tools like
ChatGPT can create realistic, behavior-driven personas that reflect
motivations, fears, workflows, and decision triggers without long
research cycles. These personas help teams pressure test ideas, refine
messaging, simulate interviews, and uncover blind spots before talking
to real users. The approach speeds up alignment and improves product
decisions while still requiring real user validation later on. 

 7 ECOMMERCE BLOG EXAMPLES (12 MINUTE READ) [12]

balances top-of-funnel education with transactional keywords, creating
posts cited by AI tools. Thinx builds authority through
mission-aligned content on menstrual health and earns high rankings
with concise, helpful posts.
