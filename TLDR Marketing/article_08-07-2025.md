 3 KEY STATS ABOUT CONVERSATIONAL SHOPPING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 A new report by Bloomreach [4] explores how conversational AI is
teaching people to shop like humans again — and what that means for
your brand.

3 findings you need to know:

1️⃣ Stores that use conversational shopping saw 33% higher
revenue per visit [4], on average.

2️⃣ 46% believe AI would offer more honest advice about an outfit
than a friend.

3️⃣ 97% of shoppers who have used an AI shopping assistant find
it helpful.

NEWS & TRENDS

 AI-GENERATED CONTENT DOES NOT HURT YOUR GOOGLE RANKINGS (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google does not penalize or reward AI-generated content based on its
presence alone. An analysis of 600K pages showed that 86.5% of
top-ranking pages contained some level of AI assistance, while only
13.5% were purely human-written. The correlation between AI usage and
search rank was 0.011, indicating no meaningful relationship. However,
pages that rank in the #1 position tended to use less AI, suggesting a
slight preference for lightly AI-assisted or more human-created
content. 

 DID GEN Z BREAK THE MARKETING FUNNEL? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gen Z favors authenticity, speed, and cultural alignment over
polished campaigns and linear journeys. Nearly half of them say they
would prefer life without the internet. This reflects their desire for
transparency and meaningful connection in a saturated digital world.
They rely on social platforms and creators for product discovery,
often skipping traditional search engines in favor of TikTok or
generative AI tools. The funnel is not broken, but fragmented and
looped, requiring brands to engage with fast and participatory content
across multiple touchpoints.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 4 KEYS TO BETTER PROMPTING (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI prompts should include clear context, structure, and intent.
Assign expert roles and outline specific processes to guide results.
Use iterative feedback loops to refine ideas through ongoing reviews.
Encourage pattern-breaking by prompting for unusual, risky, or
unconventional ideas to inspire fresh thinking. Incorporate strong,
opinionated personas to challenge assumptions and offer contrasting
perspectives. 

 NETFLIX VS. ATHLETIC GREEN'S CUSTOMER WIN BACK STRATEGY (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Acquiring a new customer costs 5X more than retaining one. Improving
retention by 5% can boost profits by up to 95%. Netflix's win-back
email failed because it gave generic reasons to return and did not
address the specific reason the customer canceled. Athletic Greens
succeeded by responding directly to a cancellation reason with a
helpful solution, showing the power of segmentation. Companies should
act quickly, build objection-specific funnels, and offer solutions
that directly address customer concerns to improve retention.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 QUERY FAN OUT COVERAGE ANALYSIS (TOOL) [9] 

 This tool analyzes how well your webpage performs for AI-driven
search queries. By entering a target keyword and URL, it generates
related search variations, breaks your page into sections, and uses
semantic analysis to match content with search intent. It reveals
keyword opportunities, shows which parts of your page best match
queries, highlights content gaps, and compares your page against top
competitors. This helps you improve AI search visibility and better
structure content for SEO.

 LOYALTY MARKETING IS REDEFINING THE FUTURE OF GLOBAL TRAVEL INDUSTRY
(5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The future of travel loyalty is shifting from points to emotional
connections. Travelers now value recognition, exclusive access, and
personalized experiences. Gen Z and Millennials want programs that
feel modern and relevant. Airlines, cruises, and hotels are using AI
and data to offer tailored perks and memorable moments. Loyalty
programs now focus on driving direct bookings and creating loyal
customers through emotionally engaging travel experiences. 

 WHY AGENTIC MARKETING IS THE NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR B2B GROWTH (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 B2B marketers continue to rely on outdated funnel models even as
automation and attribution tools become more advanced. Agentic
Marketing replaces these legacy systems with intelligent agents that
engage leads instantly across chat, email, and web without delays or
manual routing. Demandbase and Crunchbase have used this approach to
double the volume of meetings booked, triple AI-driven conversations,
and increase pipeline while reducing dependency on SDR headcount.
