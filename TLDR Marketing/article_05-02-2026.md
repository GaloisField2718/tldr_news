TLDR MARKETING 2026-02-05

 YOUR DIRECT MAIL PROGRAM HAS A BLIND SPOT, BUT THERE'S AN EASY FIX
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Companies are devoting up to 25% of total marketing spend to direct
mail – but logistics plays a major role in how far that investment
actually goes.

Lob [4] surveyed 250 senior marketing and ops leads to see where mail
breaks, WHY SURPRISE COSTS HAPPEN, and what high-ROI teams do
differently.  Here's what they found:

 	* Logistics is the #1 blind spot, but there's an easy fix.
 	* Direct mail investment is rising across the board. 
 	* Without internal logistics ownership, USPS changes disrupt
planning.

mail strategy in 2026.

NEWS & TRENDS

 AIS ARE HIGHLY INCONSISTENT WHEN RECOMMENDING BRANDS OR PRODUCTS (13
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Large-scale testing across ChatGPT, Claude, and Google AI shows brand
recommendations change almost every run. Lists, order, and result
counts vary widely, which makes ranking positions meaningless. When
prompts repeat at scale, certain brands still appear often. That makes
visibility percentage across many runs a usable signal. Even with very
different human prompts, AIs surface similar core brands. Avoid
ranking-based AI tracking and use visibility rates instead. Demand
transparent, stats-backed methods before spending on AI measurement. 

 WALMART HITS $1 TRILLION MARKET CAP, FUELED BY GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The valuation milestone reflects how Walmart has shifted profit
growth toward higher-margin businesses like its third-party
marketplace and advertising unit. Digital initiatives modeled after
Amazon have accelerated earnings growth faster than store sales,
reshaping how investors value the business. Listing on the Nasdaq 100
reinforced the company's positioning as a retail platform with
tech-like economics.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SEO PROCESS: HOW TO EXTRACT + MAP GEMINI 3 FAN-OUT QUERIES (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 AI search creates far more queries per prompt than traditional SEO,
which makes content coverage harder to manage at scale. Google Gemini
averages 9 fan out queries per prompt, can reach up to 28, and creates
about 900 queries for every 100 prompts tracked. ChatGPT averages 2
fan out queries, and there is overlap in terms across systems, which
means sites must cover many related query variations. The process uses
the Gemini 3 API to extract fan out queries and then maps them against
site content using a Domain Coverage Analyzer to identify gaps. 

 HOW TO KEEP YOUR CONTENT PROGRAM ON TRACK WITH YOUR GOALS (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Appoint one senior person to enforce standards and make final
decisions. Use a tool like ClickUp, Asana, or Monday to track every
content piece and its workflow. Before rolling it out, explain why the
system exists and show the costs of skipping steps to your entire
team. This ensures everyone follows the plan and meets deadlines.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 SEO OVERHAUL USING CLAUDE SKILLS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post shows how Claude Code installed SEO and GEO skills with a
single npx command and ran audits to find broken titles, missing SEO,
weak meta descriptions, schema gaps, and pages needing migration.
Marketing and AI visibility skills guided what to fix, while Cowork
with the Directus MCP applied changes across hundreds of pages. Links
to both the SEO and GEO repositories are in the post's comments. 

 YOUTUBE: UNLOCKING A GLOBAL AUDIENCE WITH AUTO-DUBBING (1 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 YouTube is expanding its auto-dubbing feature to all creators,
allowing them to auto-translate content into 27 different languages.
The platform has also launched “Expressive Speech” in 8 languages
(English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, and
Spanish), which is designed to capture a creator's original emotion
and energy.

 WHAT IF EMAIL MARKETERS PRACTICED UNREASONABLE HOSPITALITY? (7 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Inspired by Will Guidara's Unreasonable Hospitality, email marketing
should treat subscribers like guests, not targets. Most brands rely on
no-reply inboxes and optimize for efficiency over connection. Real
email hospitality means replying to people, honoring content and
frequency choices, and writing welcome emails that start
conversations. These choices build trust and treat subscribers like
humans. 

 TRUSTWORTHY A/B PATTERNS – STICKY CALL TO ACTION PATTERN (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Sticky call-to-action (CTA) patterns can drive strong gains in some
cases but can also reduce orders and revenue. In one test with over 8m
users, a sticky incentives footer increased incentivized orders by
0.35% but reduced total food orders per user by 0.13% and revenue per
user by 0.18%, both statistically significant. In another test with
nearly 700k users, a sticky buy-now-pay-later CTA increased adoption
by 40.2% and raised orders per user and revenue per user by about 9%.
Results show that sticky CTAs are powerful but context dependent, and
can hurt core metrics even when engagement rises. 

 A NEW LOOK AT FREE-TO-PAID CONVERSION (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Analysis of 200 B2B software products shows free trials are used by
57% of companies, far outpacing freemium, but median free-to-paid
conversion clusters unevenly around 8%. Conversion rates vary by more
than 10x between top and bottom performers, making benchmarks
misleading without context. Credit-card-required trials deliver ~30%
conversion, but materially reduce signups, shifting the growth
equation from optimization to trade-off management.
