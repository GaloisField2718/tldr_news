NEWS & TRENDS

 INTRODUCING PAY PER CRAWL: ENABLING CONTENT OWNERS TO CHARGE AI
CRAWLERS FOR ACCESS (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Cloudflare's Pay Per Crawl lets content owners charge AI crawlers for
access using HTTP 402 response codes. Publishers can set prices, allow
or block crawlers, and manage payments through Cloudflare. Crawlers
authenticate with signed headers and can agree to pricing via request.
The system enables monetization at scale, laying the groundwork for
future agent-driven transactions and dynamic licensing. Now in private
beta, it gives creators more control over how their content is
accessed online. 

 BNPL LOANS TO IMPACT CREDIT SCORES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 FICO is introducing new credit scores that include buy-now-pay-later
(BNPL) loans, aiming to give lenders better insight into repayment
behavior. This change could reduce ecommerce conversions and order
values as consumers become more cautious about using BNPL, fearing
credit score impacts. A FICO-Affirm study showed that opening multiple
BNPL loans in a short time signals higher credit risk, but responsible
use could help consumers with thin credit histories build stronger
profiles. Merchants may face short-term uncertainty but could benefit
from lower BNPL fees and more competitive provider rates.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE 3 AI FORMATS BEHIND 361M TIKTOK VIEWS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Pollo AI is an all-in-one video and image generator launched in
January. It has gained 361M TikTok views, 110K downloads last month,
and $20K in monthly recurring revenue. The team runs 14 faceless
TikTok accounts. Each posts one of three AI video formats daily: Alien
AI, Jesus AI, or Fat Pigs AI. Videos include a watermark and end with
a prompt to search “Pollo AI”. 

 YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING WITH AI AGENTS FOR MARKETING (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Relay.app founder Jacob Bank manages over 40 AI agents that handle
marketing tasks like social media content, blog updates, newsletters,
lead qualification, and partner management. These agents complete
focused workflows such as tracking LinkedIn trends, updating SEO
content, and scoring demo requests using CRM and AI data. While the
agents work autonomously, Bank reviews key outputs to maintain
quality. This approach treats AI as team members rather than tools,
allowing small teams to scale impact through thoughtful workflow
design and minimal setup. 

 HOW ATTIO DOES DESIGN (3 MINUTE READ) [8]

crowded CRM market. It relies on progressive disclosure to reduce
cognitive load and build user confidence by only revealing features
when needed. Its consistent design system ensures every element feels
cohesive and familiar across workflows. Attio makes users want to

creative flow, giving it an advantage over legacy tools.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 META: RE-ENGAGE CUSTOMERS WITH MARKETING MESSAGES ON MESSENGER (1
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meta is launching enhanced marketing messages on Messenger to help
businesses re-engage customers through chat after initial
interactions. Businesses can now send personalized or broadcast
promotional messages to subscribers using tools like CRM lists and
Messenger ads. The feature is available globally to developers and
limited to select countries for businesses. 

 GENERATE DATA WITH GEMINI IN GOOGLE SHEETS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google added an AI function to Sheets that lets users generate text,
summaries, sentiment analysis, and categorized data directly within
spreadsheet cells using Gemini. Users can automate repetitive tasks
across up to 200 cells at once by entering prompts. The feature
supports flexible data references and offers refresh options when
inputs change. It is available to select Google Workspace plans and is
rolling out gradually.

 INSIDE WIKIPEDIA'S AI REVOLT—AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE MEDIA (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Wikipedia stopped its experiment with AI-generated article summaries
after volunteer editors pushed back strongly. The AI summaries were
mostly accurate, but editors felt they did not match Wikipedia's style
and worried about AI taking over their editorial work. This situation
shows the challenges newsrooms face with AI adoption. Successful news
organizations introduce AI carefully, involving teams and earning
trust instead of imposing changes from the top down. 

 WILL AI ‘COMPLETELY REWIRE' LOYALTY PROGRAMS? (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI is helping loyalty programs shift from group-based targeting to
personalized engagement by analyzing individual behaviors and
preferences. This allows brands to deliver rewards, messages, and
experiences in real time that feel tailored to each customer and not
just part of a campaign. Experts note that this shift also improves
efficiency by automating manual processes, detecting fraud patterns,
and saving marketing teams time and budget through smarter content
creation and campaign optimization.
