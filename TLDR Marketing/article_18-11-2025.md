NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY AUTHENTIC REPRESENTATION MATTERS: HOW BRANDS CAN REACH
MULTICULTURAL AUDIENCES (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Multicultural consumers are growing in size and spending power, and
they want brands to represent them accurately. They are more likely to
buy from and pay more for brands that feature diverse people in ads.
Partnering with creators who share their backgrounds builds trust and
boosts attention and purchase intent. Supporting self-expression
through AR strengthens connection because many already use AR and
enjoy branded Lenses. Speaking up on social issues and showing real
action increases credibility. 

 WHY B2B MARKETING SHOULD BE ABOUT MORE THAN LEADS (2 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Many B2B teams fixate on lead volume, but leads mean little if a
brand lacks familiarity. When prospects have never heard of a company,
sales starts at a disadvantage because trust is missing. Most intent
signals only show short-term behavior, not brand recognition, and many
buyers are not in-market yet. Familiar brands convert more easily
because familiarity creates confidence and reduces risk. Strong
marketing builds that memory over time through content people actually
want to engage with. The goal is not just more leads but a brand
people trust before they ever enter the funnel.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 9 TIPS FOR BLACK FRIDAY SUCCESS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Split keyword research into 2 groups, where one covers general
product or brand terms and the other captures searchers looking
specifically for Black Friday deals. Keep a Black Friday tag page easy
to find, run frequent keyword checks to catch rising queries, and
update deal pages often with fresh prices, images, and timestamps.
Link related content so navigation is simple, track product changes as
they happen, promote deals across social platforms, and use channels
like newsletters or messaging groups to expand reach. 

 HOW CLARIFY TURNED LINKEDIN INTO THEIR #1 LEAD MACHINE (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Clarify turned LinkedIn into its top lead source in six months by
treating the platform as a standalone channel and posting native
content that drives conversation. It built a steady content pipeline
using weekly executive interviews and organized posts into clear
pillars that mixed personal stories, industry insights, product
education, and timely reactions. It expanded reach through creator
partnerships and consistent employee advocacy. This helped it
outperform what a company page can do alone. It tracked
high-performing posts, reused winning angles, and steadily compounded
momentum until LinkedIn became its strongest inbound engine.

 HOW TO MONITOR AI BOTS IN THE LOG FILE ANALYSER (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Log file analysis shows how AI bots interact with a site and delivers
visibility that standard analytics tools cannot match. The Screaming
Frog Log File Analyser verifies AI bots, tracks crawl patterns,
compares bot types, and surfaces issues such as high 4XX or 5XX errors
or aggressive crawling. It also shows which content is used for
training, indexing, or real time citations and highlights bandwidth
use and carbon impact from AI crawlers. Log data can be combined with
crawl data to uncover orphaned pages, detect pages bots ignore, and
measure how much of a site AI bots actually access.

 CUSTOMERS EXPECT EMPATHY (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Most consumers want brands to show real empathy, yet many companies
fall short and lose trust and loyalty. Empathy strongly influences
buying decisions and even supports higher prices, but customers doubt
most brands genuinely care. This gap grows as AI takes over more
interactions.
