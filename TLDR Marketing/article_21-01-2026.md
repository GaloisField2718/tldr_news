 CHATGPT SEARCHES GOOGLE SHOPPING TO CREATE ITS RECOMMENDATIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ChatGPT's product carousels are largely shaped by Google Shopping
results. Experiments show that the top recommended items frequently
match high-ranking Google Shopping listings. This means ecommerce
brands that want visibility inside ChatGPT need to prioritize clean
and accurate Google Shopping feeds with up-to-date pricing, titles,
images, and availability rather than focusing only on conversational
SEO. 

 THE 8 MOST INFLUENTIAL CONTENT MARKETING TRENDS FOR 2026 (13 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The dominant content trend for 2026 is the decline of search clicks
as AI-generated answers replace traditional browsing behavior. To stay
visible, brands are restructuring articles with direct answers and
long question-based subheads so AI systems can extract and cite them.
Multimedia content is gaining leverage because YouTube videos and
interactive formats appear directly in AI summaries and closed
platforms. At the same time, email lists and social audiences are
becoming more valuable as owned distribution channels as search
traffic becomes more unpredictable.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FROM DEAD-END TO DISCOVERY: TURNING YOUR WORDPRESS 404 PAGE INTO A
SMART PAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A smarter WordPress 404 page can recover lost traffic by parsing the
failed URL and extracting meaningful keywords to automatically surface
relevant posts instead of forcing users to search again. The approach
replaces a dead-end error with contextual content discovery, using
internal search logic and sensible fallbacks to reduce bounce rates
while preserving SEO value. 

 SEO TIP: SEE HOW GOOGLE IS INDEXING YOUR SITE AT SCALE (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Screaming Frog's Google Search Console integration can audit
indexation at scale through the URL Inspection API. Connect the Google
account linked to GSC, select the property, enable URL Inspection, and
run a crawl in Spider mode to pull Coverage, Indexability, and last
crawl data directly into the report. It allows review of up to 2K URLs
per day and is faster than checking pages one by one in GSC. 

 POM WONDERFUL MARKETING STRATEGY AND CAMPAIGNS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 POM Wonderful turned a hard-to-use fruit into a premium functional
beverage by creating the pomegranate juice category and owning the
supply chain. Only 12% of Americans knew about pomegranates early on,
so it focused on education through its website, design, and
self-funded science while positioning the product as a luxury health
drink. It invested over $25 million in research and used provocative
campaigns like Cheat Death and fantasy-driven ads to make abstract
health claims memorable. Distinctive bottle design, vertical
integration in California farming, and broad distribution helped it
scale into a billion-dollar brand. The category is now crowded, and
its challenge is to reclaim leadership rather than blend in.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE'S AI OVERVIEW HAS BEEN SENDING ME THE WRONG CUSTOMERS FOR 6
MONTHS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 For 6 months, a company received angry refund requests from people
who were not customers because Google's AI Overview repeatedly showed
the wrong support email for a similarly named business. The issue was
not a system bug but an AI hallucination that misdirected searchers,
sending hundreds of frustrated users to the wrong company. The
practical solution is to actively monitor Google AI Overviews for
brand-related searches, downvote incorrect summaries, and test results
across regions using a VPN. AI Overviews vary by country and may be
correct in some territories. 

 WHY INTERNAL COMMS SHOULD REPORT IN TO MARKETING (7 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Internal communications (IC) should report in to marketing because
employees are a core brand audience, and the internal experience must
align with the external brand. Marketing brings the skills IC needs to
succeed. Housing IC in marketing turns it from an administrative
function into a strategic one. It improves alignment with launches and
priorities, and creates more scalable employee communications while
still maintaining close ties to HR and leadership.
