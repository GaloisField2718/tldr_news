NEWS & TRENDS

 AD GAMIFICATION IS HERE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Brands are integrating gaming into their advertising strategies
through interactive ad formats. Disney launched advergames on Hulu and
ESPN, allowing viewers to engage in trivia and rapid-fire games linked
to brands. Amazon introduced interactive trivia ads that offer
quiz-like experiences and incentives like shopping credits. Discord
embraced "sponsored quests," enabling users to earn rewards while
participating in brand-related gaming activities. This trend reflects
the growing acceptance of gaming, with consumer spending on mobile
games recently surpassing $20 billion. 

 INSTAGRAM MAKES A COMEBACK AS BEAUTY CONTENT SEES 68% SURGE IN VIDEO
VIEWS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Instagram has experienced a resurgence in beauty content, with a 68%
YoY increase in video views during the first half of 2024. Despite
TikTok's growth in activated influencers, it has not seen
corresponding increases in engagement, contrasting with past trends.
Brands are increasingly relying on sponsored content, but engagement
growth for these posts has been modest compared to the rise in
mentions, suggesting audience fatigue.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 3 TASTY INGREDIENTS FOR FULL-FLAVORED MINIATURE STORIES (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Storytelling, much like cooking, requires a balance of flavors and
textures. Miniature stories make sense for social media platforms,
where attention spans are short. Actions add drama to stories, and
they make readers want to read on because they want to know what
happens next. Details give credibility to a story and pull readers
into it. A transformation or insight from the story builds authority
and gives people a reason to read it. 

 HOW TO USE FREEBIES TO OPTIMIZE YOUR LEAD GENERATION (7 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Freebies, like guides or checklists, can help with acquiring
long-term customers. Start by enhancing your best-performing freebies
with brand updates, content refreshes, and quality improvements.
Review landing pages and ads to optimize all supporting content.
Relaunch the updated freebie to your audience, who may not be aware of
it. Plan a yearly review to keep your lead generation content
effective.

 TWITCH ROLLS OUT VIDEO STORIES TO CHALLENGE INSTAGRAM (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Twitch has launched a video stories feature that allows streamers to
create and share 60-second videos directly on the platform. The
feature aims to keep streamers connected with their audiences even
when they're away from their setups, offering a way to share BTS
content and promote upcoming streams. By expanding its story format to
include video, Twitch hopes to reduce streamers' reliance on external
platforms like Instagram.
