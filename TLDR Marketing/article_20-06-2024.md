 WHY EXPERTS SAY WE DON'T NEED WARNING LABELS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA
PLATFORMS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Dr. Vivek Murthy, Surgeon General of the United States, has proposed
warning labels for social media due to its supposed impact on
teenagers' mental health. However, experts argue that social media
should be understood rather than feared. The science on social media's
harmful effects is not settled, with critics emphasizing the lack of
consistent evidence linking social media to poorer mental health.
Murthy cites studies showing adolescents who use social media heavily
are more prone to anxiety and depression, but newer research indicates
it can also improve mood. 

 WHY ADVERTISERS PAY MORE TO REACH VIEWERS WHO WATCH LESS (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A new study found that viewers' income and likelihood of buying a
product were not factors that determined how much it costs to reach
them ‚Äî it's how active they are on the platforms where the ads run.
More active audiences command a lower advertising price per
impression, while groups that don't tune in as often cost a premium to
advertise to. As a result, TV advertisers pay more to reach young men
who watch TV infrequently and pay less to reach women and older
groups, whereas on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, older
audiences can be more expensive to reach. This scarcity factor
explains why broadcast and cable advertising revenue largely held
steady from 2014 to 2019, even as more people moved over to streaming
services.
