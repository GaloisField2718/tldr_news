NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW FLEETING MEMES, NOT MEMORABLE MARKETING, CAME TO DOMINATE THE UK
GENERAL ELECTION (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The UK public went to the polls yesterday after a six-week election
run. Unlike past elections, there was no defining ad from a political
party. Instead, campaigning was marked by memes, bizarre TikToks of
dancing members of parliament, and cat videos. Only time will tell if
this meme-culture will become a bigger feature of Westminster
political communications. 

 INTEREST IN ECONOMETRICS JUMPS AS MARKETERS ANTICIPATE THE DEMISE OF
COOKIES (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Kantar's 2024 report shows a notable rise in interest in econometrics
among marketers anticipating the end of third-party cookies. The
proportion of marketers considering or using econometrics has jumped
to over 90%, up from 68% in 2023, as they seek effective measurement
methods in response to privacy shifts and tighter budgets. Despite the
interest, actual usage remains limited due to the high costs involved.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THREE SIGNALS OF POOR CONTENT THAT YOU CAN OUTRANK (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 There are common weaknesses in competitors' SEO content that indicate
you could easily outrank them by simply creating better content
(without link-building). Low word counts in a SERP of all blog posts
usually indicate that a more robust blog post could overtake them. If
the content winning the keyword is outdated, either based on the title
signifier or the information itself, then it's likely a more timely
article could win. Content that takes forever to deliver on search
intent (or barely addresses it) probably sends poor user experience
signals, which provides another opportunity to take over the keyword
ranking. 

 3 WAYS TO MAKE YOUR PRODUCT MORE STICKY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Data alone is useless without actionable insights. Emilia Korczynska,
Head of Marketing at Userpilot, shares her experience with a SaaS demo
that failed to allow data manipulation for campaign triggers. She
argues that stickiness can't be faked and is a result of how much
value users derive from the product. Korczynska suggests focusing on
increasing the product's value, making data actionable, and
simplifying the UI to enhance user engagement.
