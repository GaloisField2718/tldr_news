 IS INFLUENCER ACTIVISM THE NEW BRAND ACTIVISM? (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 87% of consumers expect influencers to advocate for social issues.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE POWER OF INTERNAL LINKING FOR SEO (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A site's internal linking structure significantly impacts its SEO
performance. These links inform search engines about your website's
structure, distribute link equity, improve the user experience, and
help target specific keywords. Using both contextual and navigational
links makes your website informative and optimized for search engines.
To build your internal linking strategy, perform a site audit,
identify your best-performing pages, find related content, and link
the related content to the best-performing pages.

 Point One Navigation faced challenges with a limited online presence
and high customer acquisition costs. The brand employed an SEO and
paid media strategy to increase reach and marketing spend ROI. Its SEO
efforts included programmatic state-specific content, guest posting on
industry-relevant websites, and new blog content. In Google Ads, the
company made its ad copy more relevant, updated conversion tracking,
expanded the keyword list, and A/B tested different landing page
designs. This resulted in a 672% increase in organic traffic, a 44%
reduction in CPA, and a 2X increase in lead volume.

 META REMOVES DETAILED TARGETING EXCLUSIONS FROM AD CAMPAIGNS (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Meta has removed detailed targeting exclusions from ad campaigns,
which previously allowed advertisers to prevent their ads from being
shown to specific audiences based on demographics, interests, and
behaviors. This change aims to simplify the advertising process and
ensure that ads reach broader, more relevant audiences. The move
follows criticism that detailed targeting exclusions could contribute
to discriminatory practices in advertising.

 BRAND PERSONAS ON SOCIAL: IF YOURS ISN'T DISTINCT, YOU MAY AS WELL
GIVE UP (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Audiences today favor distinct, unfiltered content. Younger
demographics seek brands that reflect a more relatable, impulsive
persona rather than polished images. Brands like Ryanair and RSPB
exemplify this trend by adopting bold, humorous personas that resonate
with Gen Z and Gen Alpha. These consumers often prioritize the
community and cultural relevance of brands over traditional product
attributes, leading to phenomena like the popularity of Stanley Cups
and skincare products among younger audiences.

outcome could necessitate changes in how marketers optimize for search
engines and run ad campaigns. To navigate these changes, marketers
