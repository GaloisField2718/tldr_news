 DEINFLUENCING: WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO IT? (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Despite its decline, the deinfluencing trend still occasionally
resurfaces, challenging brands and influencers alike. Brands like
Stanley and Skims have shown resilience by leveraging strategic
influencer collaborations and timely marketing to bounce back from
controversies. The lesson for marketers is clear: authenticity and a
solid crisis management strategy can mitigate the temporary
disruptions caused by deinfluencing. 

 WHY MARKETERS KEEP REFRESHING BRANDS INSTEAD OF BETTING ON SPLASHY
ADS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Many marketers prefer rebrands over big ad campaigns because rebrands
allow them to stay relevant and agile in a rapidly changing market. By
investing in brand building, companies like Kraft Heinz and Wayfair
can better understand consumer behavior and create a holistic strategy
across multiple channels. This approach helps to maintain a strong
identity and connect more deeply with their audience, rather than
relying solely on short-term performance marketing.

 THE RESULTS OF CANVA'S 4-WAY PRICING TEST (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Earlier this year, Canva ran an experiment on its ‚ÄúTeams‚Äù plan
pricing that evaluated two attributes: price per person and minimum
commitment. The brand tested 4 variants, ranging from $60-$159.90 per
seat and up to 5 minimum seats. The winning plan was $100 per seat
with a 3-seat minimum. The results suggest that showing the cost per
seat, rather than a total for all seats, is a better strategy.
Additionally, round numbers (e.g. $100) can actually perform better
than lesser non-round numbers (e.g. $99.90). 

 THE NEW COUCH PROBLEM (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Identifying invisible obstacles in users' lives is essential for
reducing friction and improving conversion rates. For example,
customers might delay purchasing a new couch because they are unsure
how to dispose of their old one. Adding a service to manage old
furniture can address this issue. Tools like Hotjar can be used to
observe user behavior and identify points of hesitation. Understanding
that fear of disrupting existing workflows can also be a barrier.
Companies should provide solutions that minimize risk and boost user
confidence.

 INSTAGRAM CONFIRMED THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN THE LONG-FORM CONTENT
GAME (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Instagram has confirmed it is not prioritizing long-form content. The
platform's focus will be on connecting users with friends and helping
them explore interests. Short-form video aligns better with these
objectives, as long-form content reduces interaction with friends.
Instagram will leave long-form video experiments to TikTok. There are
no plans to revive IGTV. 

 SPOTIFY ADDS COMMENTS TO PODCASTS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Spotify is allowing listeners to leave comments on episode pages.

will be rolled out this week. This move brings Spotify into closer
competition with YouTube and builds on its expansion into video
podcasts.

 GROWTH FLYWHEELS: WHY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES IN THE WORLD USE
THEM TO GROW SMARTER, NOT HARDER (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 There are three criteria a growth flywheel must meet to be effective:
the activities flow smoothly from one point to the next, each rotation
is easier than the last rotation, and each rotation produces more than
the last rotation. One of Jay Clouse's newsletter flywheels is his
automated new subscriber welcome email, which asks users what issues
they're facing that they want to see him write about. This makes it
easier to generate content ideas while also helping him grow an
engaged audience by creating relevant content. Brands can create
growth flywheels by focusing on the messenger as much as the product,
creating an identity its audience wants to show off, and leveraging
happy customers to gain new referrals.
