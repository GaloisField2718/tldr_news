 HOW AN OPTIMIZED PRICING PAGE INCREASED PAID TRIALS BY 43% (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 VectorVest, a stock portfolio management system, found from research
that users were skeptical of starting a trial despite the social proof
elements on the pricing page. The company tested a variant of the
pricing page that changed the trial offer headline, answered common
objections around hidden fees and terms, reformatted the pricing table
to connect the trial price to each plan, softened the call-to-action
to ‚ÄúSelect Plan‚Äù, and added a callout above the highest-value
plan. This resulted in a 43% increase in paid trials, demonstrating
the value of learning from real customers. 

 GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR EMAIL SIGN-UP FORMS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Optimizing sign-up forms results in more email subscribers, which
leads to better analytics, deeper brand building, and higher-value
customers. Start by ensuring you have sufficient tracking on your
forms to allow you to properly analyze drop-off points and run tests.
Look for opportunities to remove or adjust thought-consuming qualities
on the form, such as social media icons, which can create a
distraction. Get ahead of user anxiety by letting users know upfront
how often you'll be contacting them and with what sort of content. The
article contains additional tips around error messages, reciprocity,
and social proof. 

 11 EMAIL POP-UP BEST PRACTICES (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The average conversion rate on a pop-up is 3.8%. Pop-ups with an
image get 4.96%. Results fluctuate based on trigger type, number of
fields, images, and device type. When designing an email pop-up
experience, ensure the pop-up window adheres to accessibility
standards and is easy to close for everyone. Depending on your brand
and objectives, keep fields to a minimum. One field converts better
(4.3%) than multiple fields (2.6-3.5%). Fly-outs or slide-ins are also
good options for mobile where space is limited. Test these pop-ups
based on where someone's thumb sits beside their mobile screen.

 A 2-MINUTE MASTERCLASS ON PRODUCT-LED GROWTH (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Product-led growth (PLG) is growing in popularity. Used by software

PLG itself. Under a traditional model, marketing and sales push users
to product and customer success, but under PLG the four orgs are much
more intertwined.
