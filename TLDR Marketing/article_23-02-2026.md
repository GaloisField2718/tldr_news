NEWS & TRENDS

 AN UNRELIABLE FUTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Digital infrastructure is becoming increasingly fragile because a few
cloud providers dominate the market. AWS, Azure, and GCP control over
60% of global cloud capacity. Modern systems are highly complex, with
billions of lines of code, microservices, and AI workloads that stress
data centers. Small errors or capacity bottlenecks can trigger
cascading outages, as seen in recent disruptions. Physical risks and
high occupancy levels compound the problem. To reduce vulnerability,
governments and enterprises are adopting multi-cloud strategies and
on-premise repatriation to ensure that single failures do not paralyze
operations. 

 BRAND MARKETERS CAN'T SEE WHERE THEIR INFLUENCER BUDGETS GO (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Many brand marketers lack visibility into influencer budgets, with
61% unsure of agency payments to creators. 55% plan to change their
approach within a year due to opaque fees and limited benchmarks.
In-house management is growing, currently at 16%, offering direct
influencer relationships, faster content production, and better budget
efficiency.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 OUTCOME-BASED POSITIONING (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SaaS pricing is shifting from selling tools to selling completed
work. Constant Contact shows an iterative path by rewriting plan copy
around actions such as “do it yourself”, “do it with us”, and
“done for you”. Lindy takes a radical path by adding a fake Human
Assistant plan that compares its AI Work Assistant to human labor.
This approach makes the value of outcomes more obvious and may spread
across agentic AI products. 

 HOW TO PRICE YOUR PRODUCT: A PRICING MODEL DECISION TREE (14 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 This guide presents a pricing model decision tree to align how
customers pay with how they experience value. Start with buyer type
and product value, then narrow into seat, usage, outcome, or platform
models. Seat pricing works when value grows per user, usage pricing
fits when consumption maps to benefit, outcome pricing ties revenue to
measurable results, and platform pricing supports multi team adoption.
Most companies use hybrid models.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW MARKETERS ARE CREATING HIGH QUALITY CONTENT WITH AI THAT'S NOT
SLOP (WEBINAR) [9] 

 This webinar, on February 24, will show how to use AI to write
content without becoming generic. It will cover which inputs produce
valuable output, how to turn research and expert knowledge into
standout content, and provide a repeatable framework for using AI as
leverage, not a crutch. 

 IT'S TIME TO HIRE YOUR FIRST MARKETING AGENT (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI agents are outcome-focused tools that act across platforms to
automate tasks, unlike chatbots or rule-based workflows that require
constant direction. Agents start with a clearly defined role, a
specific task, and are built and refined using real outputs. In
marketing, agents can handle competitive intelligence, content
repurposing, or growth analytics. For example, a competitive
intelligence agent scans LinkedIn, YouTube, and G2 to generate weekly
reports on competitors. A content repurposing agent turns webinar
transcripts into draft social posts while referencing brand guides and
past content. Tools like Relay.app and Mutiny enable automating and
delivering these agents' outputs.

 HOW TO USE THE MAGIC (AND SCIENCE) OF RITUALS TO IMPROVE YOUR WRITING
(4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Rituals, unlike simple routines, carry symbolic meaning that helps
shift mindset and improve performance. Research shows they can reduce
stress and prime focus even without religious belief. Writers like
Stephen King use consistent pre-writing rituals to signal to the brain
that it is time to create. Experts say that repeating specific actions
in the same place builds mental associations that make it easier to
enter a productive state. Whether religious or secular, rituals work
because action shapes psychology and reinforces identity. 

 THE FUTURE OF BRAND CREATIVITY BELONGS TO THE SMALL AND RECKLESS (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Large holding companies are adopting AI out of fear of being left
behind rather than a clear creative strategy. By standardizing AI,
they are reinforcing systems built to reduce variance, which leads to
faster production of safe, undifferentiated work. As advanced AI tools
are widely accessible, scale is no longer a durable moat, and
bureaucracy becomes a drag on originality. At the same time,
experienced talent is leaving large networks, lowering barriers for
smaller agencies to compete.
