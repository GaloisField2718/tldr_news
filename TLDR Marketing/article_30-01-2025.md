NEWS & TRENDS

 BIG BRANDS CONTINUE DE&I PULLBACK, CAVING TO RIGHT-WING PRESSURE (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Target, Walmart, and McDonald's, are scaling back their DE&I
initiatives in response to right-wing pressure, while Costco and Ben &
Jerry's remain committed. Target recently ended its DE&I goals and
REACH initiatives, stopped sharing diversity data, and lost its
sponsorship of Twin Cities Pride. Meta and McDonald's have also
retreated from DE&I, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasizing “masculine
energy” in hiring. Apple and JPMorgan are pushing back against
anti-DE&I efforts. 

 META'S CONTENT MODERATION ROLLBACK DRAWS CONCERNS FROM ADVERTISERS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta dismantling its fact-checking program allows posts that
previously violated guidelines to remain online. Advertisers worry
this could lead to more offensive content, similar to what drove
brands away from X. Meta has reassured advertisers by offering tools
to manage ad placements.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY MOST BRANDS FAIL AT CUSTOMER LOYALTY (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most brands fail at customer loyalty because they focus only on
transactions instead of long-term relationships, missing the financial
impact of trust-driven engagement. Research shows that strong customer
relationships lead to lower acquisition costs, higher customer
lifetime value, and increased revenue, yet many companies do not
deliver a personalized and consistent experience. The key to success
lies in AI-driven insights to anticipate customer needs, optimize
messaging, and engage at the right moments to build trust and loyalty
in the long run. 

 ONE OF THE BIGGEST MISTAKES STARTUPS MAKE? NOT HAVING A UNIFIED
MESSAGING STRATEGY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A common startup mistake is having fragmented messaging, where
marketing, sales, and product teams each tell a different story to the
customer. Keeping core messages in hidden documents or team-specific
tools leads to misalignment and missed opportunities across teams. The
homepage, as a highly visible and cross-functional asset, is the best
place to house these messages for both internal and external clarity.

experiments and Bayesian causal inference for deeper insights. With
direct integration into Google's MMM Data Platform, marketers gain
more precise measurement of their Google Ads performance.

 3C ANALYSIS (CUSTOMER): HOW TO MAKE YOUR BRAND SOMETHING CUSTOMERS
WANT (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Slack's early success can be explained by the Trigger-to-Outcome
Journey. Slack originally positioned itself as a group chat app but
struggled to convince decision-makers to pay for it. Customers
actually valued the tool for reducing meetings, emails, and stress.
The company repositioned its product as a new way of working rather
than just another chat app, which significantly increased its
perceived value and led to significant business growth. Strong brand
positioning requires understanding customer triggers, problems,
objections, and desired outcomes. 

 CUSTOMERS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR AI FEATURE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Labeling a product as “AI-powered” does not increase trust,
justify higher pricing, or improve customer perception. While
companies often emphasize AI in marketing to appeal to investors and
boost SEO, most users care more about tangible benefits than the
underlying technology that powers it. Successful messaging focuses on
clear outcomes, such as time saved or improved productivity rather
than relying on AI as the key selling point.

 TURN YOUR VIRAL MOMENT INTO REAL BUSINESS VALUE (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Capitalize on virality by turning it into news coverage, using it as
social proof for new users, or potentially embracing a new target
audience. 

 INSIDE THE ROAS TRAP (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Many brands are prioritizing performance marketing with conversion
attribution, but this strategy risks underinvesting in brand marketing
that meaningfully drives long-term growth. 

 SOCIAL FIRST MARKETING (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Instead of treating social media as a last-minute distribution
channel, content should be designed with social in mind from the
start.
