NEWS & TRENDS

 THE CONTENT QUALITY QUESTION (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Nearly half of Gen Z and millennials say they prefer social media
content over TV and movies. This is a shift in how people define
quality. Traditional markers like big-name stars and high production
value matter less as audiences seek relevance and connection with
creators. Choosing content is now influenced by ease, attention span,
and mental effort. The media industry risks falling behind if it
clings to outdated ideas of what makes content valuable. 

 TRUMP'S PAUSE ON MOST TARIFFS RAISES MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS AMID
AD BUSINESS UNCERTAINTY (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Trump paused most planned tariffs for 90 days on non-retaliating
countries, but kept a 10% tariff on most others and increased the
tariff on Chinese goods to 125%. The entertainment industry may suffer
from advertising pullbacks and risks tied to China, such as a ban on
U.S. films or intellectual property issues. Companies like Disney
could benefit if trade deals reduce recession fears. Small and medium
businesses, including celebrity-backed product lines, face the biggest
risks from ongoing tariff uncertainty.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 VIRALITY ISN'T MAGIC OR SCIENCE. IT'S EMOTION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Going viral isn't about luck or timing, it's actually about emotional
resonance and cultural relevance. The most shareable content combines
strong emotional impact, social value for the sharer, and simple,
remixable formats built for interaction. Today's viral content most
often invites participation and gives people something they want to be
associated with, making them feel part of the story. 

 HOW TO WIN ON B2B APP STORES (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Weglot grew to over 40,000 paying customers by using CMS app stores
like WordPress and Shopify as its main distribution channel, with 80%
of signups coming directly from these platforms by 2021. It maintained
high visibility through top-rated reviews, strong SEO, and active
community involvement across ecosystems. Weglot also built a partner
network of 4,500 agencies by 2024, which generates leads and handles
onboarding, lowering acquisition costs. It supplements this with
events, third-party reviews, and creative entry points like Webflow's
gallery to scale without heavy ad spending. 

 HOW TO TURN YOUR EXPERTISE INTO A MARKETABLE TALK (2 MINUTE READ) [8]


 To market your product, service, or brand, start by identifying a
signature topic that aligns with a clear audience pain point. Then
offer a fresh perspective and reflect your proven success. Build a
simple outline using a clear structure, then craft punchy one-liners
to highlight each point. Enhance your message with relatable stories
and analogies, and refine your delivery style to feel natural. Once
you're ready, pitch your talk to relevant events.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 PAID SOCIAL MAY BE TAKING THE LEAD, BUT EMAIL AND TEXT HAVE STAYING
POWER (WEBINAR) [9] 

 This webinar on April 24 will be looking at how top brands are
adapting to shifting consumer behaviors, fading loyalty, and rapid
tech changes. Marketing leaders will share what tactics they're
leaving behind, what they're investing in now, and how they define
success in a digital-first world. 

 HEAD OF INSTAGRAM REVEALS SECRETS TO GROWING IN 2025 (50 MINUTE
VIDEO) [10] 

 To grow on Instagram, focus on feed posts for visibility while
recognizing that Stories and DMs are more for direct interactions.
Share short, engaging videos instead of long-form content to align
with Instagram's priorities. Hashtags are no longer a reliable tactic
for increasing reach, so focus on quality and relevance instead.
Engage with your audience around the time you post to drive more
profile visits. Most algorithm changes are small, so major drops in
reach are often tied to outside events.

 WHY PUBLISHERS' FACEBOOK TRAFFIC IS SURGING (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 As Meta eases restrictions on political news, publishers are
experiencing a dramatic rise in Facebook referrals, with some seeing
up to 10x year-over-year growth. At the same time, Apple News
continues to underperform as an ad platform, falling short in both
sales execution and publisher value. 

 AI CONTENT WORKS, BUT ONLY IF YOU DO THE WORK (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI can boost content volume and production speed, but without the
right systems, it creates more complexity. To scale effectively, teams
need well-defined workflows that go beyond one-off prompts, combining
multiple tools, human checkpoints, and prompt iterations. Editorial QA
is also essential to catch bland or inaccurate output, while strategy
and analytics are needed to guide the whole process.
