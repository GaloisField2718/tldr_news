 CMOS ARE IN TROUBLE. SHOULD ANYONE CARE? (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The instability of CMO roles and their redefinition by companies
threatens both long-term brand growth and the execution of impactful
social initiatives. CMOs are instrumental in leading efforts that
align with sustainability, diversity, and equity. Examples include
P&G's campaigns on unconscious bias and Hinge's commitment to reducing
loneliness among Gen Z. The trend towards focusing on immediate sales
results risks losing the broader social benefits that strong CMO
leadership can achieve.

 PPC LEAD GEN CASE STUDY: 20X SPEND IN 1.5 YEARS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A case study on how a PPC agency helped its home renovation client
surpass $10M in revenue. The team found that the existing account was
fragmented across 10 Search campaigns. The ads were running on
"Maximize clicks" and using GA4 for lead tracking. The agency
consolidated existing campaigns to provide more data to Smart Bidding,
switched to ‚ÄúTarget CPA‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúMaximize clicks‚Äù,
switched to the Google Ads Tag for lead tracking, set up Offline
Conversion Tracking, and optimized every aspect of the ads. With that
foundation, they switched to optimizing towards Qualified Leads, which
increased Total Deal Value by 100% and ROAS by 63%.
