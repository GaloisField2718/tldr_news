 AMAZON SCRAPS ITS TIKTOK-STYLE INSPIRE FEED (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 After two years, Amazon has discontinued Inspire, a feed designed to
make shopping more interactive through short-form videos and images.
Despite the rise of social commerce, Inspire failed to gain traction,
in part due to weak creator incentives and stiff competition from
TikTok. Amazon is shifting toward AI-powered shopping recommendations
and external social media integrations to promote product discovery. 

 WHY NIKE RECRUITED KIM KARDASHIAN TO UP ITS WOMEN'S GAME (6 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 NikeSkims is a strategic move to strengthen Nike's women's business
and drive innovation in performance wear. The collaboration positions
Nike to compete more directly with brands like Lululemon while giving
Skims a foothold in sportswear. Experts see it as mutually beneficial,
combining Nike's technical expertise with Skims's influence in
fashion. If NikeSkims successfully balances function and style, it
could reshape the global women's activewear market.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW NOTION & FIGMA TURN USERS INTO CONTENT CREATORS (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Notion and Figma drive SEO growth through UGC-powered asset libraries
that rank on niche, high-intent keywords. Notion's template
marketplace enables users to create and monetize templates, turning
onboarding challenges into an organic growth engine. Figma's community
ecosystem fosters engagement by showcasing user-generated design
elements with social proof, reinforcing discoverability and
credibility while continuously expanding indexed content. 

 WHERE BEING CREATIVE TRULY MATTERS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Creative content has a stronger positive impact on customer and
expert ratings than creative packaging or aesthetics. For
Oscar-nominated movies, each point increase in creative content
increased the chances of winning Best Picture by 9x, while board games
had a 3.5x higher chance of winning awards for each content point.
Regular people rated creative content in games 32.4% higher but gave
only a 15% boost for creative packaging. Experts respond positively to
creative packaging, but regular people may find it unappealing or
negative. Companies should focus creativity on core product features
or messaging while keeping packaging and visual aesthetics more
conventional to avoid alienating customers. 

 STREAMLINING YOUR ICP RESEARCH INTO 3 Q'S (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ICP research focuses on identifying where potential customers spend
time, understanding their biggest work frustrations, and positioning a
solution that fits their needs. Instead of overanalyzing every detail,
the approach should focus on 3 key questions. First, where do
customers engage professionally, such as in Slack communities or at
conferences? Second, what daily challenges frustrate them? Finally,
how does your solution fit seamlessly into their workflow? This
approach refines ICPs in a way that directly impacts revenue without
getting lost in the weeds.

high-value platform for brands focused on community-led growth,
particularly in gaming, tech, and lifestyle. Strategies include gated

 DISALLOW, CANONICALIZE, NOINDEX, OR REMOVE? HOW TO PROPERLY BLOCK
CONTENT THAT'S VIOLATING GOOGLE'S SITE REPUTATION ABUSE POLICY (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This piece discusses the correct methods for blocking content
violating Google's site reputation abuse policy. It shares that using
robots.txt or canonicalizing the content are ineffective, as they
allow content to remain indexed and rank. The recommended approaches
are noindexing the content or completely removing it with 404s or
410s. Noindexing ensures Google recrawls the page and removes it from
the index, while deleting the content ensures it can't rank.

 DUOLINGO ‘KILLED' ITS MASCOT WITH A CYBERTRUCK, AND IT'S GOING
WEIRDLY WELL (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Duolingo staged the “death” of its mascot in a Cybertruck
accident. The marketing stunt proved effective, driving a 38% spike in
Android downloads and a 58% jump in web searches overnight. The
campaign, structured as an interactive challenge where users
“resurrect” Duo by maintaining learning streaks, gamified
engagement while fueling retention. The high-impact, low-cost viral
marketing approach capitalizes on pop culture, controversy, and
gamification to increase brand visibility and bring new customers. 

 WHAT COMES AFTER THE DEI BACKLASH? (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The backlash against DEI programs has led many companies to scale
back or abandon them. While DEI has roots in the civil rights
movement, many programs have focused on ineffective, surface-level
strategies like bias training rather than addressing systemic issues.
To improve DEI, companies should prioritize standardized hiring
processes, pay equity, and inclusive recruitment. The majority of
Americans still support DEI, but to gain broader backing, programs
must benefit everyone.
