NEWS & TRENDS

 DISCOUNTS BOOST BRAND LOYALTY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Price discounts, loyalty points, and experiential rewards all lift
customer loyalty. Discounts generate the strongest boost, and loyalty
points and experiences outperform BOGO offers. Tactics that build
emotional engagement create longer-lasting connections than incentives
focused only on savings. Still, heavy discounting can weaken brand
perception, train customers to wait for deals, and undermine long-term
value. Promotions work best when used with intention rather than as
routine price cuts. 

 TRUST AND PERSONALIZATION KEY TO WINNING OVER B2B BUYERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 B2B buyers now rely more on personal factors like trust and values,
which have risen in importance by 10% since 2021. Professional drivers
still influence 58% of decisions, but personal and societal drivers
account for 42%, and many buyers start with a preset list where 92%
end up purchasing from someone already on it. Most marketers think
they deliver strong brand communication, yet only 39% of buyers feel
that suppliers tailor their offer to their needs, and only 5% of
marketers achieve true hyperpersonalization. Brands also struggle with
onboarding, which reinforces the growing importance of trust and
personalized experiences in winning deals.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE TEXT OVERLAY FORMULA TO OPTIMIZE ADS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Optimized text overlays on videos and GIFs can increase clicks by up
to 127%, and the best results come from placing medium sized text near
the edges rather than the center. The research finds that X posts
perform best when text covers 24% of the frame, Facebook sees up to
27% higher CTRs with medium text, and Instagram engagement peaks when
text covers 11% of the frame. Static images work differently and tend
to perform best when larger text is centered. These effects come from
how viewers process the balance between text and imagery, which
increases attention and engagement. 

 WHAT'S IN A NAME? A LOT, ACTUALLY. HERE'S HOW TO PICK THE RIGHT ONE
FOR YOUR COMPANY (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A strong brand name helps a company stand out, but the process
requires time, structure, and clear criteria rather than a single
burst of inspiration. Founders should treat naming as a month-long
effort that starts with solid positioning, a detailed naming brief,
and a broad brainstorm that produces hundreds of options. A shortlist
should then be evaluated for trademark risk, domain availability,
distinctiveness, pronunciation, and longevity. The final step is legal
clearance, which often includes a knockout search and a comprehensive
search before deciding whether to file a trademark.

 IT'S TIME TO RETHINK WHAT THE FEED IS FOR (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Under Old Social, reach was linked to follower size. Now, unless a
post appeals to non-followers, it rarely gains traction. Brands must
adapt to a recommendation-based environment where consistency alone no
longer works. Some have embraced a high-volume approach, flooding
feeds with clips or creator-led content to increase their chances of
being picked up. Others focus on episodic storytelling to build
momentum and retain viewer interest, much like programming a TV show.
Large brands like Netflix and Amazon are leading this shift by
developing recurring series, while smaller brands like Little Joy or
Craighill are seeing real sales lift from serialized posts. 

 WHATSAPP OWNS INDIA (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 WhatsApp has become essential business infrastructure in India
despite being built for consumers. It forces small businesses to rely
on manual workarounds, hacks, and risky mod apps because true
automation sits behind the restrictive and costly Business API. Meta's
shifting policies, delivery caps, and pricing make the platform
unstable, and its ad-driven incentives prevent features that would
separate personal and professional use. An ONDC-style messaging
protocol that enables interoperability across apps would enable
businesses to use purpose-built tools without abandoning WhatsApp,
reducing dependence on a single platform. 

 GOOGLE CEO WARNS THAT NO TECH GIANT IS SAFE IF AN AI BUBBLE BURSTS (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 An AI bust would affect every major tech firm, including Google.
Today's investment surge shows both rational optimism and signs of
irrational exuberance similar to the dotcom era. Analysts and Wall
Street leaders predict a correction that could impact markets more
broadly. Investors are overexcited even as AI remains a profound
long-term shift. Current AI tools like Gemini can still make errors
despite Alphabet's recent valuation surge.
