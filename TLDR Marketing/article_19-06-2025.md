 BLUESKY'S DECENTRALIZED DREAM AND HOW IT'S RESHAPING THE SOCIAL MEDIA
ECOSYSTEM (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Decentralized social media platform Bluesky reached 36 million users
in just 16 months. Offering creators true ownership of their content
and audience, Bluesky challenges traditional platforms that control
algorithms and extract most of the revenue from creators' work. Its
customizable “feeds” system allows users to control how content is
distributed, driving more traffic to publishers without penalizing
outbound links. Safety and community growth are core to its design,
with early viral moments and invite-only access helping form strong,
diverse user groups. COO Rose Wang envisions Bluesky as the last
platform that creators will need. 

 A.I. MIGHT TAKE YOUR JOB. HERE ARE 22 NEW ONES IT COULD GIVE YOU (14
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI is creating new human jobs in the areas of trust, integration, and
taste. Roles like AI auditors, ethicists, translators, and escalation
officers will ensure systems are accountable and fair. On the
technical side, jobs such as AI integrators, assessors, plumbers, and
personality directors will help embed AI meaningfully into
organizations. Creative and strategic roles like product designers,
story designers, and world builders will grow in importance as
companies rely on people with strong judgment and vision to guide AI
toward outcomes that connect with human preferences.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DUAL CTAS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 GitHub uses both an embedded email capture form and a secondary
call-to-action button on its homepage, a combination not commonly seen
together on other brand sites. 

 UPPERCASE FEELS COMPETENT, LOWERCASE FEELS WARM (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Uppercase brand names are seen as more competent and distant, while
lowercase ones are viewed as warmer and friendlier. In experiments,
unfamiliar brands appeared 52% more competent in uppercase and 68.8%
warmer in lowercase. Cultural context matters: Americans rated
lowercase brands as 16% warmer, while Chinese participants rated
uppercase brands as 11.2% more competent. For B2B brands targeting
professional, hierarchy-valuing markets, uppercase is more effective.
Lowercase suits friendliness-focused strategies in egalitarian
cultures.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 GOOGLE AI MODE TRAFFIC DATA COMES TO SEARCH CONSOLE (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Google Search Console now includes clicks, impressions, and position
data from AI Mode. A click counts when a user clicks an external link.
Impressions are counted when your content appears in AI responses.
Positions are tracked individually for each element. Follow-up
questions in AI Mode are treated as new searches. While this update
brings more visibility into AI-powered results, Google still doesn't
allow filtering specifically for AI Mode data. 

 SEO IN AN AI-FIRST WORLD (WEBINAR) [9] 

 Dave Gerhardt, Founder of Exit Five, will join Andrei Țiț, Head of
Product Marketing at Ahrefs, on June 24 to break down the current
state of search, what strategies are no longer effective, and how to
maintain visibility as earning clicks becomes more challenging. 

 TIKTOK SHOP DEBUTS LIVE PRICE MATCH AS IT READIES FOR SUMMER DEALS (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Livestream purchases now account for the majority of user activity on
TikTok Shop, with over 75% of users buying directly during events. The
platform's summer campaign includes a price match guarantee and
cashback incentives, adding transactional urgency to its
entertainment-first model. This approach closes the gap between
engagement and purchase, increasing the platform's utility for both
brands and consumers.

 THE DULL MEDIA TARIFF (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Poor media formats are causing a decline in campaign ROI because 75%
of ad inventory receives no active attention. Ads placed in
low-attention environments waste billions of dollars, with brands
losing 43 cents for every dollar spent. Strong creative cannot
overcome dull media since attention levels set the limit for ad
performance. Attention drops sharply in fast-decay formats like mobile
and scroll-heavy placements, while slow-decay formats like premium
video hold attention longer and perform better. Shifting focus to
measuring actual viewer engagement through Attention Volume, which
combines attentive reach and active attention time, can improve media
planning by prioritizing where attention truly happens. 

 ESCAPE THE INBOUND VS. OUTBOUND TRAP (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Most marketers treat inbound and outbound as separate or even
competing strategies, often choosing one over the other based on
preference rather than effectiveness. Both approaches should be
interdependent components of a unified revenue system. Inbound builds
trust and generates engagement, but without structured outbound
follow-up, much of that interest goes unconverted. Conversely,
outbound efforts that ignore buyer behavior underperform in isolation.
