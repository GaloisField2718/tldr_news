RESOURCES & TOOLS

 WHY KEYWORD RESEARCH TOOLS GIVE SUCH DIFFERENT NUMBERS (1 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Google Keyword Planner (and related tools such as Keywords
Everywhere) provide data on the inputted keyword clustered with other

additional data sources. SEMrush uses its own algorithms to come up
with another different number, but often ends up closer to Ahrefs than
KWP. Consequently, for the term "Jigsaw Puzzle" you will see 40.5k
volume in Google Keyword Planner and 21k volume in Ahrefs.

gap ‚Äì the area between new user acquisition and product feature use.
It‚Äôs often organized under Marketing or Product, but it works best
when combined with the Product function. Ideally, all teams understand
growth and actively work towards it, regardless of the org structure.
