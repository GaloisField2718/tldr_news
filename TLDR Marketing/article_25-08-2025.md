 BEAUTY & FASHION BRANDS FACE 'ATTENTION RECESSION' AS CREATOR CONTENT
STRUGGLES TO CONNECT (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Audiences are becoming less engaged despite rising creator content
for beauty and fashion brands. Skincare posts grew 22% in H1 2025
while engagement fell 20%, showing content saturation is reducing
impact. Smaller creators outperform larger accounts, with beauty nanos
seeing 27% higher engagement and 19% more video views, and fashion
nanos achieving 33% higher engagement. Paid content often
underperforms despite higher spending. 

 CRACKER BARREL'S MARKETING FIASCO SHOWS INVESTORS ARE MAKING WOKE A
MASSIVE RISK FACTOR (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cracker Barrel's recent logo update, which removed long-standing
Americana imagery, triggered a backlash that erased nearly $100
million in market value. The incident signals that perceived
“woke” moves are increasingly viewed by investors as high-risk
brand decisions. When brand identity shifts appear misaligned with
core audiences, especially without a clear rationale or timing
strategy, they can trigger immediate market consequences.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A GOOD RIVALRY CAN ELEVATE YOUR BRAND (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Referencing a well-known competitor in your marketing isn't always
risky - it can be very effective. A study across 100 brands found that
rivalry mentions, especially negative ones, boost engagement and
intent to buy, particularly among loyal customers. On your own
channels, lean into clever jabs at competitors to energize your base.
For broader campaigns, stick to storytelling cues to turn competitive
messaging into a narrative people follow. 

 HOW CHILI'S CONTINUES TO DRIVE SALES FROM SOCIAL MEDIA (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Chili's drives consistent sales growth by combining a high-frequency,
culture-first social strategy with value messaging and operational
execution. The brand uses social media as a testing ground, responding
quickly to fan behavior and shifting campaigns in real time. Chili's
is able to turn engagement into consistent revenue growth by aligning
trend-driven content with timely offers and in-restaurant upgrades.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 LET'S TALK IMAGE FILE SIZES (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Large email images, especially animated GIFs, will impact loading
times, deliverability, and user experience. Keep individual images
under 250KB and total email size minimal, with GIFs ideally under 1MB.
Oversized files may slow load speeds, trigger spam filters, or get
clipped in clients like Gmail. Tools like TinyPNG and ImageOptim help
compress images, while Ezgif.com can optimize GIFs. 

 REVERSE DICTIONARY (TOOL) [8] 

 Type a phrase, definition, or description you are thinking of, and
this Reverse Dictionary will find the word that best fits that
description.

 WHAT 30 YEARS OF RUNNING LIFECYCLE PROGRAMS TAUGHT US ABOUT BUILDING
PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY WORK (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Good lifecycle programs integrate with the broader customer
experience rather than operating as isolated messaging channels.
Overcomplicated flows and short-term click-focused tactics often fail,
while programs that prioritize key behavioral loops, reinforce
customer habits, and continuously test and optimize drive retention
and long-term value. Treat lifecycle as a way to solve customer
problems consistently, not just a tool to hit immediate metrics. 

 ADS FOR HIGH-PRICE VS LOW-PRICE PRODUCTS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Based on an analysis of 2,317 TV car ads, $11.3B in ad spend, 15
years of sales data, and 7 years of search trends, researchers found
that informational ads increased sales for lower-priced cars under
$36,000 or those with lower quality ratings, while emotional ads
boosted sales for higher-priced, high-quality cars and increased
searches across all price points. Emotional ads also created stronger
buzz and brand interest. However, informational ads remained more
effective at converting sales for cheaper cars. The findings suggest
expensive products benefit most from emotional ads, while inexpensive
products perform better with informational ads. 

 MOVING BEYOND THE HAMSTER WHEEL OF CONTENT CREATION (8 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Content curation is growing in relevance, driven by user fatigue with
algorithmic posts and AI-generated noise. Curation can offer a
competitive edge by emphasizing taste, judgment, and cultural
listening. Unlike content creation, curation builds trust by surfacing
what matters, shaping narratives, and reinforcing thought leadership.
For marketers, integrating curation alongside original content can
deepen brand authority, expand networks, and improve campaign
performance.
