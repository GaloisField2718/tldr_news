 GOOGLE ADS WILL AUTOMATICALLY START PAUSING AD GROUPS WITH LOW
ACTIVITY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google ad groups created at least 13 months ago that have not had
impressions in the past 13 months will be paused starting from March
11. Advertisers can turn them back on if needed, but unpaused ad
groups without any impressions in the following three months will be
automatically paused again. This change is designed to improve budget
efficiency and campaign quality for advertisers. 

 META WILL STOP PAYING AUSTRALIAN PUBLISHERS FOR CONTENT AS PART OF
ITS SHIFT AWAY FROM NEWS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta's announcement to cease payments to Australian news outlets
reflects its broader strategy to distance itself from news content.
The decline in Facebook News usage made Meta realize it took the wrong
approach when dealing with Australia's media outlets. Meta has decided
not to enter into new commercial deals for traditional news content in
several countries and indicated it will not engage in similar
agreements in the future. This decision underscores Meta's focus on
AI-recommended Reels and short videos as engagement drivers, leaving
publishers in a challenging negotiating position.

 THE 4 TYPES OF COMPETITIVE POSITIONING ANCHORS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Product positioning should get a prospect to understand what they‚Äôd
do with your product and the unique value it provides. Positioning
anchors act as reference points to help succinctly articulate your use
cases and value. An anchor could be a specific tool, a category of
tools, adjacent tools, or adjacent categories. This post includes a
diagram illustrating how Atlassian Jira uses each of these 4
positioning anchors to reach a different problem framing and
positioning statement. 

 PRODUCT-LED CONTENT STRATEGY IN TOFU, MOFU, AND BOFU (3 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This article explains how to include product-led content across each
stage of the marketing funnel. Top-of-funnel (TOFU) content should
attract new readers, so focus on educating readers on key challenges
that they may be facing without being overly promotional.
Middle-of-funnel (MOFU) content should articulate who your product is
targeted at and the outcomes it can achieve. Avoid boasting about your
product‚Äôs benefits in bottom-of-funnel (BOFU) content. Instead,
highlight the tangible outcomes and results of current customers. 

 WINBACK CAMPAIGNS VS. RE-ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGNS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Both winback and re-engagement campaigns aim to increase lapsed
engagement. However, these two terms aren‚Äôt interchangeable.
Re-engagement campaigns tend to be centered on a single marketing
channel. For example, sending a targeted email to re-engage customers
who once reliably opened emails but no longer do. A winback campaign
takes a more holistic approach to the customer-brand relationship. The
goal is less focused on a particular marketing channel and more on
increasing overall engagement across all channels. The intention is to
increase customer LTV.

 OUTBOUND IS HARDER THAN EVER (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article reflects on the impact of Google and Yahoo's mass mailer
updates. Outbound email is becoming increasingly challenging. Google's
changes affect only @gmail domains, but the frenzy around these
updates highlighted the issue of excessive outbound email volume. To
face the issue of email volume, companies must reassess their email
strategies, focus on reducing quantity, and prepare for more
restrictions in the future. 

 THE WILLY WONKA EXPERIENCE‚ÄôS GENERATIVE AI DEBACLE IS JUST THE
START OF OUR NIGHTMARISH NEW ADVERTISING REALITY (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The ‚ÄúWilly Wonka experience‚Äù that took place in Scotland last
month garnered attention for promising a grand experience. However, in
reality, it was a disastrous letdown for many ‚Äî an empty warehouse
with minimal offerings. This disparity between marketing portrayal and
reality sparked widespread discussion about the implications of using
generative AI in advertising. It raised concerns about misleading
consumers with unrealistic depictions. Legal experts stress that

AI-generated content.
