NEWS & TRENDS

 DARK TRAFFIC IS COSTING PUBLISHERS 14-21% OF THEIR REVENUE (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Dark traffic, traffic hidden by advanced adblockers that prevent
analytics, ads, and cookie banners from being tracked or displayed,
accounts for 14-21% of a publisher's total audience. This unmeasured
audience, consisting of real users with purchasing power, represents a
significant loss in both visibility and monetization for publishers.
As newer adblockers gain traction and the market fragments, publishers
are facing increasing challenges in recovering lost revenue and
audience insights. 

 REDDIT'S LATEST POLICY CHANGE COULD STIFLE FUTURE PROTESTS AGAINST
THE PLATFORM (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Reddit now requires moderators to submit requests to change subreddit
visibility or content restrictions. This rule limits mods' ability to
quickly respond to harassment or organize protests like they did
during the 2023 blackout. The change reduces moderators' control while
giving Reddit admins final say. Automatic approvals are available only
for smaller, newer subreddits.

perception to guide content positioning. Plan for repurposing by
determining how to transform a single insight into multiple content
formats. Finally, link your content strategy to revenue by connecting
with individuals who engage with your posts.

 INTRODUCING SPEED BRAIN: HELPING WEB PAGES LOAD 45% FASTER (16 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Cloudflare's Speed Brain improves web page load times by prefetching
content users are likely to visit next. For example, it can anticipate
that a user on an e-commerce site will navigate from a parent category
to a product page, preloading that content in advance. Lab testing has
demonstrated a 75% reduction in Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and a
45% improvement in overall speed for prefetches. Speed Brain is
available to all Cloudflare users at no additional cost. 

 THE ADVANTAGE OF SUGGESTIVE BRAND NAMES (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Brands with names that highlight key product benefits, like
Co-Schedule or DoorDash, improve consumer recall of core features by
2.2X compared to non-suggestive names. Consumers also remember other
product benefits equally well. Suggestive names can limit
repositioning, so brands need flexibility for future shifts. While lab
studies support this approach, real-world testing on established
brands is needed to confirm its impact on purchasing behavior. 

 HOW #METOO AND OTHER SOCIAL MOVEMENTS SWAY CONSUMERS (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 The #MeToo movement affected consumer preferences for gendered
products. Sales of traditionally feminine shoes, like pink high heels,
dropped by 14.4% after the movement gained momentum. An experiment
revealed that women influenced by #MeToo were less interested in high
heels, reflecting a rejection of gender norms. The research suggests
brands relying on gender-based marketing should adapt to evolving
consumer values.
