NEWS & TRENDS

 FIRST-TIME SUPER BOWL ADVERTISERS LOOK TO TACKLE STIFF COMPETITION (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Häagen-Dazs, Instacart, and Duracell are running Super Bowl ads for
the first time, spending up to $8M for 30 seconds of airtime. New
advertisers must work harder to make their brands memorable, as
established brands like Budweiser and Doritos already have strong
associations with the game. Some, like Angel Soft, are using
unconventional strategies, while others, like MSC Cruises and
Häagen-Dazs, are leveraging celebrity endorsements. Many first-time
advertisers spent years building brand awareness before their Super
Bowl debut to maximize impact.

increase from the previous year.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 6 COMMON MANUAL BIDDING MISTAKES TO AVOID (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google will phase out enhanced CPC (ECPC) by March, leaving
advertisers to choose between manual and automated bidding. Poorly
optimized manual CPC leads to inconsistent results, but regular
performance reviews with proper lookback windows prevent reliance on
outdated data. Gradual bid adjustments, long-term reviews, and using
bid modifiers like audience and device settings can improve efficiency
and ad performance.

 SHOULD I INVEST IN PAID MARKETING? DECISION TREE (2 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Paid marketing isn't a shortcut to success. Companies need
product-market fit and organic traction before investing in it. This
decision tree suggests reaching 10K monthly visitors first, ensuring
landing pages convert, and setting up proper tracking. Without these,
brands risk burning cash without results. Plus, early testing alone
could cost around $75K.
