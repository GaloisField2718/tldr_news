NEWS & TRENDS

 PEOPLE TEND TO TRUST ‘PET-FLUENCERS' OVER HUMAN INFLUENCERS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pet influencers are seen as more trustworthy than human influencers
on social media. Ads featuring animals like Nala the Cat or Bunny the
button-pressing dog perform better in terms of reach and engagement
compared to those featuring people. Viewers perceive pet endorsements
as more sincere, especially when the messaging is aligned with
immediate gratification. This is due to rising influencer fatigue and
the belief that pets have no hidden agenda. 

 YOUR GLOBAL AI STRATEGY NEEDS A CULTURAL UPGRADE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI can translate content quickly, but it often misses local
preferences. For instance, a US retailer's European expansion suffered
due to a lack of cultural context. Campaigns perform better when trust
signals align with local values. While AI handles tasks like
translation and pricing, human insight is still key for tone and
cultural nuances.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 APOLOGIZING BOOSTS SALES (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Emailing an apology with a benefit after a trivial mistake increases
revenue, email open rates, and click-through rates. One study showed
an apology email generated 126.9% more revenue than a non-apology one
(€628.74 vs €277.13). Apologies are most effective for small
technical issues and for brands not already seen as warm. This
strategy backfires for major mistakes or when overused. 

 10 PRODUCT LAUNCH PITFALLS PMS & PMMS MUST AVOID (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many products fail not due to poor quality, but because they don't
capture enough attention. A strong go-to-market strategy and
well-timed launch are critical in standing out, especially in markets
filled with similar AI-generated offerings. Ten common mistakes
include launching too early or too often, failing to enable sales and
CS teams, lacking clear differentiation, and using one-size-fits-all
GTM playbooks. Phased rollouts and involving both PMs and PMMs early
can reduce risk and misalignment. A successful launch depends on clear
storytelling, targeted outreach, and ensuring the product solves
top-priority customer problems. 

 TIPS FOR MARKETERS TO DO MORE WITH LESS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Marketing teams that face tighter budgets and limited headcount
should prioritize smarter workflows and tools to maintain impact. This
article shares 10 efficiency-focused tactics, such as using AI for
content ideation, automating routine reporting, repurposing
user-generated content, and aligning teams around a shared ‘north
star' metric.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 AI AVATARS ESCAPE THE UNCANNY VALLEY (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI avatars are becoming more realistic, combining facial expressions,
lip sync, and body movement. Early models were limited, but newer ones
like Hedra and OmniHuman can animate full characters from a single
image and audio. These avatars are used by consumers for storytelling,
by SMBs for ad creation, and by enterprises for training,
localization, and scaling executive presence. Tools like Synthesia and
ElevenLabs help make these avatars more expressive and useful across
languages and use cases. 

 A DEEP DIVE INTO REDDIT USERS AND WHAT THEY THINK OF MARKETING (11
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Reddit's user base is predominantly Gen Z and Millennials, with 73%
of users under 44. While the platform is notoriously skeptical of
marketing, 46.6% of surveyed users say they welcome brand engagement
when done authentically, and another 31.1% are fine with it if it's
non-intrusive. Brands that win on Reddit avoid “shilling”, share
helpful expertise within relevant threads, and build their reputation
on the platform over time. By doing so, they are able to effectively
tap into the platform's high engagement and rich discussions for both
visibility and voice-of-customer research.

 TUBI'S ‘CHRONICALLY ONLINE' MARKETING TEAM IS BUILDING OUT A NEW
KIND OF GIFTING STRATEGY (5 MINUTE READ) [12]

 WELLNESS IS A CULT, AND THIS OAT BRAND IS THE LEADER (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Oat Cult is reimagining the overnight oats category with bold
creativity and gut-friendly ingredients. The brand is a mix of a
maximalist, cult-inspired identity with Gen Z's appetite for wellness
that has personality. It stands out through unexpected tactics like
horror-movie aesthetics, loud packaging, irreverent humor, and a
visual identity that rejects wellness clichés. Instead of chasing
supermarket shelves, it built buzz through LinkedIn, Instagram, and
coffee shops. 

 HOW SATURATED COLORS IMPACT CONSUMER BEHAVIOR—AND WASTE (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Saturated colors like vivid reds, blues, and greens increase
perceived product effectiveness or potency, influencing both purchase
intent and how much of a product consumers use. This visual shortcut
can increase sales but may lead to underuse of critical items like
disinfectants or medications, or overconfidence in performance.
