NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE WON'T PULL COOKIES IN 2024 (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has delayed its plans to phase out third-party cookies in
Chrome, citing the need for more time due to industry and regulatory
pressure. Despite assurances that it wouldn't backtrack on its
timeline, Google did not announce a new date, but mentioned it would
not meet its target of deprecating cookies during the second half of
Q4 this year.

MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google is developing a two-hop proxy to enhance privacy for Chrome
users, a move that has major implications for advertisers. For ad
location targeting, advertisers will only have the option to target
regions designated by Google, which won't be accurate. The proxy will
mask users' identities, meaning advertisers will not be able to
distinguish between genuine and bot traffic. Google is increasing its
collection of uniquely valuable location data, which could increase
advertising costs.
