NEWS & TRENDS

 DO HAPPY PEOPLE SHOP MORE? (14 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Happier people spend more money than less happy people. This effect
is strongest for indulgent or discretionary items, while spending on
utilitarian products can be lower. In a study where participants
received $10 to spend freely, those with higher trait happiness spent
more overall and were more likely to buy non-essential items. The
effect depends on the type of product, with happiness increasing
spending on indulgent items and reducing it on highly utilitarian
ones. Happiness drives greater engagement with enjoyable purchases. 

 HOW PEOPLE USE CHATGPT (53 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This report analyzes ChatGPT's global adoption, usage patterns, and
economic impact. Users under 26 and women now make up a large share,
with adoption fastest in low and middle-income countries. Non-work
queries account for 70% of messages, mostly on Practical Guidance,
Writing, and Seeking Information. Writing dominates work use, often
modifying existing text, supporting decision-making and productivity
in knowledge-intensive jobs.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO SEND POST-PURCHASE EMAILS AT THE RIGHT TIME (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Many brands send post-purchase emails at the wrong time, reducing
relevance and impact. For example, ASOS sent a review request before a
customer even tried the products, missing the chance to align
messaging with actual behavior. A better approach is to use order and
return data to trigger automated flows. When multiple sizes are
purchased, mark the order as high return likelihood and delay review
emails until returns are processed. This ensures post-purchase emails
are timely and more likely to drive engagement. 

 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CHANGE PRICING? (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Price changes are overwhelmingly non-destructive and often
growth-positive for SaaS companies. Only 4% of companies saw revenue
decline after making a change, while 74% experienced either no drop or
an increase in growth. One in four companies see growth exceed 20%,
which shows that pricing is an underused strategic lever. 

 HOW TO MARKET TO A HIGHLY TECHNICAL AUDIENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Experts Exchange turned a failed newsletter into a successful product
by shifting from presenting themselves as experts to curating valuable
content for IT professionals. Its ByteSize newsletter now has 206K
subscribers, a 47% open rate, and generates revenue through
sponsorships. The company achieved this by writing in a consistent
“Tony Stark” voice, refining content through performance data, and
cutting its list from 400K to 206K to focus on engaged readers. By
acknowledging its audience's expertise and delivering useful, witty,
and curated content, it transformed a skeptical community into an
active subscriber base.

 THE ART OF THE CELEBRITY AD DEAL (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Building a campaign around a celebrity requires more than booking
appearances. The brand must map its objectives to the talent's
schedule and branding, then co-develop a campaign with clearly defined
deliverables. Pre-campaign research must include timing windows, past
brand collaborations, and public perception. Activation should start
well before the campaign launch to build rapport and secure deeper
buy-in. To improve performance and reduce costs, brands should bundle
deliverables across departments, reduce repetitive asset requests, and
tailor content to match the celebrity's natural voice and audience. 

 AI BROKE THE OLD MARKETING PLAYBOOK. HERE'S THE NEW ONE (9 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 AI has reshaped B2B marketing, making old playbooks and siloed
specialist teams ineffective. Companies now face declining search
traffic, derivative content overload, outbound saturation, and blurred
GTM roles as ripple effects of AI adoption. The new playbook requires
authenticity and differentiation in content, account-driven growth
strategies, and fewer but higher-impact campaigns. Teams should also
restructure around AI-powered generalists, called “Gen Marketers,”
who can combine creativity with AI tools to drive results. This
approach positions marketing as a company's moat in the AI era.
