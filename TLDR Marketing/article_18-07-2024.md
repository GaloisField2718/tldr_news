NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW SHEIN AND TEMU SNUCK UP ON AMAZON (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Chinese-owned platforms Shein and Temu have rapidly grown to
challenge Amazon's dominance in the U.S. ecommerce market driven by
aggressive marketing, innovative supply chain management, and a focus
on under-served demographics, despite facing logistical pressures and
ethical scrutiny. 

 A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE DEBATE ABOUT INSTAGRAM AND TEENS (6 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 After years of contentious relationships with academic researchers,
Meta is opening a small pilot program that will allow a handful of
them to access Instagram data in order to study the app's effect on
the well-being of teens and young adults. Documents released by a
whistleblower in 2021 showed that the company's own research has
repeatedly found that Instagram can harm teenagers, especially teenage
girls. Some are skeptical about how helpful Meta's pilot program will
be, since the tech giant has ultimate control over the data that is
handed over, but many agree it's a small step in the right direction. 

 WHAT THE STATE OF SOCIAL MEDIA SATURATION MEANS FOR BRANDS (7 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 This article examines the impact of social media saturation, where
over 5 billion users and constant content production create a chaotic
landscape for brands. Audiences struggle to engage with the
overwhelming amount of content, so brands should focus on originality,
understand their audience's preferences, and set new success metrics.
It is important to think creatively and have a flexible strategy when
navigating the complexities of modern social media.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE BEST DAY TO SEND EMAILS, BASED ON KLAVIYO DATA (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Wednesdays and Thursdays stand out as peak days for email marketing
across industries, with higher open and click rates noted. Businesses
in food and beverage experience peak open rates on Tuesdays and click
rates on Fridays. Apparel and accessories favor Tuesdays for open
rates and Wednesdays for clicks, mirroring trends in health and beauty
sectors. Sporting goods, surprisingly, show Sunday as the top day for
click rates, differing from other sectors. 

 STOP THE DEBATE: YOU NEED A PLANS & PRICING PAGE ON YOUR WEBSITE (13
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Including a pricing page on your site helps prospects understand your
offerings without needing a sales interaction, preventing them from
turning to competitors for pricing information. Transparency reflects
confidence in your product, making it easier to handle objections
early. While some argue that complex products require sales
conversations to determine pricing, the friction created by hiding
prices often outweighs the benefits. Hiding pricing pushes the
potential sticker shock to the sales conversation, which decreases
sales efficiency and increases CAC.

 A BRIEF MEETING WITH GOOGLE AFTER THE APOCALYPSE (9 MINUTE READ) [12]


 SEO expert Brandon Saltalamacchia discusses the severe impact of
recent algorithm changes on small publishers. His company, Retro Dodo,
is down 90% in traffic. Google Search Liaison Danny Sullivan invited
him to share insights on supporting creators but didn't provide
actionable SEO advice. Saltalamacchia proposes creating a Google
Search Creator Advisor role to offer practical guidance. He also
suggests simplifying Google's SEO guidelines and making Search Console
more like YouTube Creator Studio. 

 WHY ‚ÄòFOLLOWERS' ISN'T A VANITY METRIC (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Follower count is not a vanity metric. Today, follower growth is
important for expanding the marketing funnel. Focus on shareability
for static content and using series content to attract followers for
short-form videos. Series content is a consistent content type that
includes ‚Äúon the next episode‚Äù type of language or thinking within
the content.
