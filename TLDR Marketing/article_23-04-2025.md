NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE WILL KEEP COOKIES AND BACKTRACK ON ITS OPT-OUT PLANS (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 After years of signaling the end of third-party cookies, Google
announced it will retain the tracking technology in Chrome, abandoning
a promised opt-out prompt. The decision was influenced by concerns
from regulators that cookie deprecation could entrench Google's
dominance through its Privacy Sandbox. Although Google will continue
to enhance privacy-focused APIs and explore anonymization features,
marketers can expect continued reliance on legacy tracking
infrastructure for the foreseeable future. 

 MOST CONSUMERS WILL PAY 25% MORE FOR THEIR FAVORITE BRANDS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A recent survey found that over two-thirds of consumers are willing
to pay an average of 25% more for their favorite brands. Loyalty is
not driven by price alone, but by consistent product quality, personal
and rewarding experiences, and long-term brand familiarity. US
consumers are especially brand-attached, with most naming at least one
brand they remain loyal to and many expressing a willingness to pay
premium prices even in the face of economic uncertainty.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE SECRET FOR BETTER A/B RESULTS (THAT MANY EXPERTS DON'T EVEN GET
RIGHT) (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A/B test accuracy heavily depends on ensuring users actually see the
variation being tested. Many testers make the mistake of including
users in results who never saw the changed element, especially if it
appears below the fold or in navigation. The solution is to track
element visibility, such as requiring 50% visibility for at least 2
seconds, using custom JavaScript or advanced testing tools. Re-running
past tests with visibility triggers can reveal winning variations that
previously showed flat results.

 HOW NETLIFY TURNED GITHUB INTO ITS MARKETING TEAM (3 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Netlify's “Deploy to Netlify” button turned GitHub into a viral
growth channel by letting users instantly deploy code from a
repository with one click, removing friction and making it the default
deployment tool. Each button in a GitHub project acted as both
onboarding and free marketing, reaching GitHub's 100M+ user base and
contributing to 25% of Netlify's traffic. This created a
self-replicating loop where users who deployed a site often added the
button to their own projects, fueling continuous organic growth. As a
result, Netlify grew to over 5 million developers and now sees 10,000
new sites deployed daily. 

 BETTER CONNECTIONS, BETTER CONTENT (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Great content starts with strong internal collaboration, yet only
half of non-content marketers report a good experience contributing.
Meanwhile, 95% believe their input would make content more effective.
Bridging that gap starts with building relationships through
thoughtful conversations that uncover team priorities. Look for shared
problems to guide content ideas that meet multiple needs. Make
contributing easy with clear asks and project management. A documented
strategy and defined approval process help avoid confusion and build a
repeatable system that will earn internal support.
