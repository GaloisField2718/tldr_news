NEWS & TRENDS

 CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE GETS WORSE. AGAIN (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Customer experience in the U.S. has declined for the third
consecutive year, reaching its lowest average score of 69.3 out of
100. The decline was influenced by inflation, shrinkflation, and
ineffective customer-service chatbots. Consumers feel they are not
getting value for the higher prices they are paying despite
pandemic-era issues like shipping delays and understaffing being
resolved. Companies that hastily implemented AI chatbots have worsened
the situation. 

 KEY TAKEAWAYS OF REUTERS INSTITUTE DIGITAL NEWS REPORT 2024 (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 X is losing its status as a key news source, with TikTok surpassing
it in several regions. There has been a decline in news consumption on
Facebook and X despite efforts by Elon Musk to position X as a leading
news platform. TikTok's popularity for news is growing. YouTube and
Facebook remain the most used platforms for news, while X struggles to
gain credibility. A link to the full 168-page report is provided in
the article.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DON'T BE ON TIKTOK UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO BE ON TIKTOK (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Brands struggle on TikTok due to several key factors: reluctance to
embrace unconventional or "ugly" content that resonates with the
platform's audience, failure to engage through compelling hooks and
in-app styles that disguise branded content, and a lack of strategic
posting that prioritizes quality over quantity. Successful TikTok
strategies involve leveraging capcut filters, meme-style content, and
real-life moments, deviating from traditional brand presentations to
capture user attention effectively. Planning content as a social
calendar without thoughtful engagement strategies can lead to TikTok
penalizing brands by limiting their reach. 

 RELAUNCH THE OLD STUFF (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Product marketers often focus on launching new features. However, the
majority of impactful changes often come from repositioning existing
ones. This approach is effective because not all new features achieve
product-market fit. Customers typically value established
functionalities the most. Even when a new feature succeeds, refining
its messaging over time based on customer feedback can enhance its
effectiveness in attracting prospects. 

 HOW TO WRITE BETTER DIGITAL PR EMAIL SUBJECT LINES (18 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Reboot Online conducted a study of over 1,000 email subject lines to
identify the length, types, and styles of headlines that are most
likely to grab journalists' attention. Avoid using questions, which
have a 13% lower open rate than statements. Provide a clear and direct
subject line that tells the recipient exactly what they will get.
Common words like ‚Äúdata,‚Äù ‚Äústudy,‚Äù and ‚Äúsurvey‚Äù don't
significantly impact open rates and can sometimes be seen as spammy.

 HOW TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN CREATIVE MARKETERS AND MARKETING
ANALYSTS (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Employees waste 5.3 hours every week waiting for data from
colleagues. Marketers have historically built structures that grouped
specialities together, with ‚Äúcreatives‚Äù on one team and
‚Äúanalysts‚Äù on another. However, today's always-on campaigns
require constant feedback loops between these functions. To bridge the
gap, invite both teams to initial kick-off meetings, create a shared
dashboard that's easily accessible, reserve a set amount of time to
refine campaigns-in-flight, and ensure all teams aim for the same
targets. 

 INBOUND VS OUTBOUND PMM (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Inbound PMMs concentrate on market, customer, and competitor
understanding to shape product strategy and roadmap. They conduct
research, gather insights, and aid in GTM strategy development.
Outbound PMMs handle product launches, including GTM planning,
positioning, cross-functional coordination, and sales enablement.
These roles differ in focus, skills needed, and impact on the product
life cycle, with Inbound PMMs influencing early stages and Outbound
PMMs focusing on market introduction and growth.
