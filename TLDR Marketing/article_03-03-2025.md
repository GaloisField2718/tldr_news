NEWS & TRENDS

 42% OF PEOPLE SAY GOOGLE SEARCH IS BECOMING LESS USEFUL (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google's dominance in search is eroding. 42% of people say search
engines are becoming less useful and 76% are seeing too many sponsored
results. Most Gen Z and Millennials prefer AI chatbots or alternative
platforms. Brands and marketers face a reality where authenticity and
community-driven discovery matter more than traditional SEO. 

 MARKETING CAMPAIGN ISSUES MULTIPLY: HERE'S WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Despite increasing campaign volume, 87% of senior marketing
decision-makers have faced performance issues in the past year. 45%
have considered ending campaigns early due to poor results. Budget
constraints add to the challenge, with only 45% of marketing budgets
allocated to campaigns and 68% struggling to secure sufficient
resources. Measuring ROI remains difficult, as 70% report moderate to
significant challenges, while 66% struggle to demonstrate impact to
stakeholders. Channel fragmentation and AI implementation further
complicate campaign execution, making performance management even more
complex.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE 8-HOUR WINDOW MOST STARTUPS ARE MISSING (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Grammarly's $13B success was not built on driving traffic to its
website but by integrating directly into users' writing environments
with a browser extension. This model, adopted by companies like Notion
with its Web Clipper and Zoom with its Google Calendar integration,
ensures users engage with the product naturally as part of their daily
tasks. By giving the extension away for free, companies create a
habit-forming experience that leads to conversions when users see the
need for more advanced features. 

 HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR MARKETING FOR AI (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI models don't function like search engines, making "brand
placement" measurement impossible. Users engage in conversations,
leading to varied responses based on context. AI visibility can be
gauged through AI-driven referral traffic and monitoring AI crawlers.
Optimization strategies include structuring content for AI
readability, allowing AI scraping, and expanding formats like video,
audio, and multilingual text. Off-site tactics, such as guest
appearances, press releases, and engagement on AI-ingested platforms,
boost exposure in AI training data.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 BLUESKY-BASED INSTAGRAM ALTERNATIVE FLASHES LAUNCHES PUBLICLY (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Launching with content from the Blacksky community, Flashes is a
Bluesky-based photo-sharing app that offers an Instagram-like
experience with more customization. Users can upload up to 4 photos or
short videos, access over 50K custom feeds, and curate their profiles
with “Portfolio Mode” to showcase their best work. Flashes
integrates with Bluesky's network, allowing posts to reach a broader
audience. The app also includes built-in filters and curated feeds
from artists. 

 HOW TO SET UP ACCOUNT-DRIVEN GTM: TAM MAPPING, ACCOUNT TIERING,
SIGNAL TRACKING (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Account-driven GTM requires mapping and prioritizing the total
addressable market and ICPs in a CRM. It segments accounts into tiers
based on fit, deal size, and intent signals to optimize marketing and
sales efforts. The strategy uses firmographic, demographic, and intent
data to proactively target and engage accounts rather than relying
solely on inbound leads. Effective implementation involves setting up
clear account tiers, tracking key engagement signals, and maintaining
data hygiene. Unlike traditional ABM, this approach organizes and
tracks a broader set of potential customers to drive more efficient
growth.

 WHY APPLOVIN STOCK FELL 36% THIS WEEK (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Short sellers claim AppLovin's growth was fueled by fraudulent ad
tactics, including inflating CTRs, misusing Meta's targeting data, and
installing apps without user consent. Allegations suggest that
AppLovin's AI-powered ad platform relies on deceptive engagement
metrics rather than genuine user behavior, which could lead to legal
action and app store removals. This reinforces the need for strict
auditing of media partners and prioritizing revenue-based performance
metrics. 

 THE MARKETPLACE STARTUP DILEMMA: HOW STARTUPS OVERCOME THE
CHICKEN-AND-EGG PROBLEM (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Startups launching a two-sided marketplace must solve the
“chicken-and-egg” problem by attracting both supply and demand.
Tinder's co-founder Whitney Wolfe recruited 15,000 initial users by
targeting sororities first, then presenting the app to fraternities.
Airbnb gained its first 6,000 landlords by scraping Craigslist for
listings and emailing landlords with a compelling pitch. Uber secured
early drivers by offering guaranteed pay and attracted riders by
providing free rides at tech events, relying on word-of-mouth
marketing. Successful startups prioritize early user satisfaction,
ensuring they become advocates who drive organic growth. 

 BUILDING YOUR REACTIVE PR STRATEGY WITH ALICE WALKER GIBBONS (25
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Reactive PR involves quickly responding to breaking news or trends to
gain media coverage. Companies should monitor news daily and use
centralized systems like Slack to share opportunities. A content and
expert quote bank streamlines approvals and speeds up responses.
Targeted pitching to relevant journalists is more effective than mass
outreach, and relationships with “SEO journalists” can boost
success. Reactive PR should complement a broader strategy, leveraging
industry events and reports while strengthening media connections even
if a pitch doesn't land.
