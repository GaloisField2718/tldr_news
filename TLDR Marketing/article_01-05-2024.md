 THE "PLANET FITNESS" ERA OF SAAS IS OVER (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The dirty little secret of enterprise software companies is that they
make a lot of money off people who don't show up. However, the new era
of product-led growth (PLG) is predicated on showing value before a
purchase and then regularly showing value post-purchase to prevent
churn. This plays out in the form of de-risked buying decisions,
clearer ROI, and shorter contracts. Although this creates challenges
for PLG businesses, it's ultimately a net positive for the industry
long term.
