NEWS & TRENDS

 BNPL IS EXPANDING FAST, AND THAT SHOULD WORRY EVERYONE (8 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Buy now pay later (BNPL) usage has increased past 91M users in the
US. 25% use it for groceries rather than discretionary purchases. Late
payments rose to 42% in 2025, up from 34% in 2023, and most BNPL loans
remain invisible to credit bureaus. This creates a gap between
perceived and actual financial health, especially among subprime
users. Teams focused on growth or product optimization should
reexamine how BNPL affects user lifetime value and channel ROI. 

 VIRTUAL INFLUENCER VS DIGITAL TWIN: WHO WINS? (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Consumers trust virtual influencers more than digital twins, giving
them an edge in recommendations and purchase influence. 76% trust
virtual influencers for recommendations and 68% for purchases, while
57% say digital twins reduce trust. 62% of creators worry about losing
ground to virtual influencers, and 59% fear feed oversaturation.
Brands value virtual influencers for control and availability, but
they require high creative investment and lack the emotional depth of
human creators.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW EBAY SOLVED STRANGER DANGER (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 eBay's breakthrough was creating trust in a space with none. Its two
way ratings, star tiers, and seller metrics made trust measurable and
raised prices for reliable sellers. PayPal protection, identity
checks, fraud tools, and dispute resolution reduced the risk of bad
transactions. Over time, this trust system became a moat that kept
users on the platform and set the template for Airbnb, Uber, and Etsy.


 HOW TO USE AI AGENTS FOR MARKETING (6 MINUTE READ) [9]

marketing, and sales enablement. Each workflow operates on verified,
structured data and connects through centralized platforms including
Redshift, Gong, Retool, and Braze. Results include 100% enrichment
coverage, a 3X increase in meetings, and a 25% lift in

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 EXCALIDRAW (TOOL) [10] 

 Excalidraw is a free whiteboard that allows users to create
hand-drawn-style diagrams and visualizations. It's ideal for quickly
sketching ideas, wireframes, mind maps, and flowcharts in an informal
way. 

 SEO TIP: CHROME'S DOCUMENT.DESIGNMODE (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Instead of waiting for a designer to mock up webpage content changes,
you can make the changes directly in Chrome with document.designMode.
Navigate to the page in Chrome, right-click the page and choose
"Inspect", navigate to "Console", type in "document.designMode =
'on'", then return to the page to begin editing. 

 TIKTOK'S BULLETIN BOARD (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 TikTok launched its bulletin board feature to help brands and
creators send direct updates and exclusive content to followers in a
simple one-to-many format. The feature has already been used in beta.
Followers can join a creator's bulletin board from the profile page
and receive inbox notifications they can react to with emojis. The
feature is available to creators who are at least 18 years old and
have 50K followers or more.

 HOW GPT SEES THE WEB (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GPT receives only small snippets and windowed slices of pages, so it
never sees full webpages or raw HTML. It can request more text through
open and click actions, but each retrieval is capped and cannot
reconstruct entire articles. Context size settings control how much
text each window contains, and even the High setting still enforces
strict limits. The sliding window process shows that GPT reads pages
in isolated segments and must summarise instead of reproducing long
content. 

 WHY FAN EDITS ARE MOVIE MARKETING MAGIC (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Fan edits on TikTok use quick-cut scenes with popular songs to create
emotional connections with characters and stories. Lionsgate leverages
these edits to boost engagement, introduce younger audiences to older
titles, and promote new releases. The studio creates its own edits and
collaborates with fan editors to ensure content resonates while
supporting conversion. These clips capture attention and deepen fan
connection beyond traditional marketing.
