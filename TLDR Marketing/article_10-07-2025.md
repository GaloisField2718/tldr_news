NEWS & TRENDS

 WELCOME TO THE BRAND NEWSLETTER ERA (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Brands are using Substack to create newsletters focused on personal
stories, advice, and behind-the-scenes content that readers seek. The
Head of Lifestyle at Substack advises against treating newsletters
like traditional email marketing. Brands should share authentic,
first-person stories led by founders or trusted writers. Substack
followers are often “superfans” who deeply engage and spread the
word. For brands, the goal should be community-building, not sales.
Lean into niche content and create a space for slower, more meaningful
engagement. 

 PODCASTING IS MONETISING WITHOUT YOU (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Podcast ad spending is rising fast, but Spotify is moving away from
ads. Its Partner Program pays creators directly through subscriptions
and platform revenue. Over 70% of shows have joined, with listening
hours up 25%. Some creators now earn far more than on YouTube.
Networks are losing out, as Spotify blocks ads for Premium users.
Podcasts are also shifting into video, live shows, and influencer
content. Spotify's aim is not to win podcasting, but to rebuild it on
its own terms.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LOW-TRAFFIC, HIGH-VALUE: A CRO CASE STUDY ON MILLBANK FX (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Millbank FX, a low-traffic but high-value foreign exchange provider,
used in-depth user research and A/B usability testing to redesign its
website for better engagement. Initial testing showed users struggled
to understand its services, missed key content like the homepage
video, and found the site less informative than competitors. The team
rewrote content to address user pain points, boosted credibility with
testimonials and trust signals, clarified CTAs, and restructured the
page to guide users through a persuasive flow. After launching the new
pages, the company saw a 100% increase in leads, stronger lead
quality, more organic traffic, and confirmed improvements in usability
testing. 

 ADVERTISE NEXT TO MORE EXPENSIVE BRANDS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mid-tier fashion brands can boost their perceived prestige by placing
ads near premium brands. In one study, these brands were rated 16%
more prestigious and raised prices by an average of 12.3% when
advertising exclusively alongside luxury brands. The effect only works
if the brand already has some equity and does not apply to very
low-tier brands. This strategy is common in both physical and online
retail, where proximity to luxury signals helps mid-tier brands
justify higher prices. 

 HOW TO CREATE AND PROMOTE A LEAD MAGNET (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Keep the lead magnet short, solve a specific problem, and make it
easy to use in under 10 minutes. Avoid long ebooks and focus on quick
wins. Promote it by adding the link to your bio, messaging new
followers, and using clear CTAs. Ask people to comment for access,
then direct them to a landing page to collect emails before delivering
the lead magnet.

 YOUTUBE LETS CHANNELS SHARE MORE PERFORMANCE DATA WITH BRANDS,
UPDATES AUTHENTIC CONTENT DETECTION (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 YouTube is allowing creators in its partner program to share
aggregated audience and performance data with brands to increase
monetization opportunities. The data includes views, likes, comments,
subscriber counts, demographics, and shopping tag performance. YouTube
is also enhancing its content enforcement by improving the detection
of mass-produced and AI-generated videos. Additional updates include
loyalty badges for up to ten years, a new filter to flag shopping tag
violations, and a pull-to-refresh feature for Channel pages. 

 INSTAGRAM TO LET GOOGLE AND BING INDEX PUBLIC POSTS FROM PROFESSIONAL
ACCOUNTS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Starting today, Instagram will let Google and Bing index public
posts, reels, and videos from professional accounts. This applies only
to public accounts run by users over 18, and older content before 2020
is excluded. Users can opt out through privacy settings or by
switching to a personal or private account. This update could help
creators and businesses gain more visibility outside Instagram, as
their posts may now appear in Google search results.

 BRANDS ARE EMBRACING FANTASY: THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND ESCAPIST
MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Brands are using escapist marketing to create emotionally immersive
experiences that offer relief from stress and digital fatigue,
especially through fantasy and storytelling. Gen Z favors brands that
provide emotional connection and creativity, and the most admired
brands in Canada are seen as adventurous, honest, and imaginative.
Fantastical campaigns like Coca-Cola's “Real Magic” and Apple's
“Mother Nature” use surreal visuals to deepen engagement and build
brand loyalty. However, consumers may lose trust if these campaigns
lack authenticity or try to cover unethical practices, making
transparency essential for long-term success. 

 ARE AI OVERVIEWS WORTH PURSUING? (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google's AI Overviews have caused a drop in click-through rates, with
one study showing desktop CTR dropped by up to two-thirds when AIOs
appear. These features most often show up on informational queries and
reduce organic traffic even when a site is cited in the AI response.
Marketers should analyze whether their keywords and content are being
impacted and adjust their strategies accordingly. For traffic and
conversion goals, it is better to target lower-funnel keywords with
commercial or transactional intent. If brand awareness is the goal,
use tactics like clear answers, authoritative content, and embedded
media. 

 CLEANING GENERATES A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF ENGAGEMENT ONLINE (10
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Unilever's Dirt Is Good promotes the benefits of getting dirty,
challenging traditional cleanliness messaging. The brand practices
“storyliving” instead of just storytelling, with its team fully
believing in and living the story of the brand. It uses local
insights, finding sweat is the most common stain, followed by period
and food stains, with many unaware of how to remove them. The “Every
Stain Should Be Part of The Game” campaign found that 68% of UK and
90% of Saudi women don't know how to treat period stains. Dirt Is Good
also embraces influencer marketing, using “cleanfluencers” on
TikTok to boost engagement.
