 OPENAI TO RELEASE WEB BROWSER IN CHALLENGE TO GOOGLE CHROME (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 OpenAI plans to launch an AI-powered web browser that integrates chat
features and AI agents capable of completing user tasks like filling
forms or booking reservations. The browser could give OpenAI access to
key user data that fuels Google's advertising business, which accounts
for nearly 75 percent of its revenue. Chrome holds more than
two-thirds of the global browser market, while OpenAI's ChatGPT has
500 million weekly users and 3 million business subscribers. The
browser is built on Google's Chromium code and is part of OpenAI's
broader push to expand its services and compete more directly with
Google.

BOSSES “PLANNING FOR SUCCESS” (2 MINUTE READ) [5]

see shows like The Bear and Andor. The deal is based on complementary
audiences, with Disney+ skewing under 34 and ITVX skewing over 45.

plans to pursue similar arrangements with other European broadcasters.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO BUILD AN IRL EVENTS STRATEGY (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In-person events can be powerful marketing tools, but only if they
align with a startup's audience, go-to-market motion, and existing
strengths. Events should be evaluated like any other marketing
channel, using clear frameworks that consider fit, expected ROI, and
whether the team has the right resources to execute well. Success
depends on treating events as full campaigns, with strong creative,
content, and follow-up. Coverage and composition are key to choosing
the right events: high coverage brings reach, while high composition
ensures relevance. Events fail when handled by the wrong people, are
overly sales-driven, or lack brand alignment, so thoughtful planning
and execution are critical. 

 SCALE AI: HOW A $14B BRAND BUMP IMPACTS ORGANIC SEARCH PERFORMANCE (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scale AI's growth in search visibility is closely tied to its
exploding product and brand presence. Scale's brand strategy has
positioned it as essential AI infrastructure, using high-profile
partnerships and credibility signals to dominate organic and
generative search. Meta's $14.3 billion investment in the company
triggered a 140% increase in traffic and resulted in 93,000 backlinks.
Its homepage now receives 80% of all organic traffic, while product
pages reinforce trust and credibility to optimize for high-intent
users. Scale also gained significant visibility in generative engines
like ChatGPT and Perplexity, with ChatGPT alone accounting for 25% of
its web referrals last month. 

 QUICK LLM-OPTIMIZATION EXERCISE (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When asked how to optimize for LLM, a starting point is to see how
your brand is currently represented by ChatGPT. Begin by prompting
with “What is [your brand name]?” and review if the description
matches your current offerings or if it's outdated. Check the sources
ChatGPT uses, update or remove old content to align with your latest
messaging. Then repeat the process with common prospect questions.

 EXACTLY WHAT TO MEASURE WITH LIFT-BASED MARKETING INVESTMENTS (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Traditional attribution models are no longer reliable due to privacy
laws, ad blockers, and fragmented customer journeys. A better way to
measure results is through lift-based testing. This approach tracks
the increase in conversions or engagement after a specific tactic
begins. It compares results against a baseline to show real impact.
The process starts with measuring exposure, such as impressions. It
then looks at engagement, like replies or subscriptions, followed by
conversions or sales. Testing different tactics over time reveals what
actually works. 

 HOW ALAMO DRAFTHOUSE MADE GOING TO THE MOVIES COOL AGAIN (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Alamo Drafthouse redefined the movie theater experience by treating
film as a cultural event rather than passive entertainment. It earned
national acclaim through unique programming like live-scored silent
films, curated pre-shows, and interactive comedy events. By 2012, it
ran Austin's three highest-volume restaurants and reported over $12
profit per person, far exceeding traditional theaters. Its acquisition
by Sony in 2024 confirmed its lasting influence, as it continues to
thrive by building local communities around film rather than copying
industry trends.
