 75% OF TOP BRANDS FALL VICTIM TO FRAUD IN GOOGLE SEARCH ADS (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 75% of top brands in the US and UK are targets of identity theft
through Google Search Ads. The issue results in significant financial
losses and creates considerable threats to customers. Common fraud
practices include impersonating brands on Google Ads to steal customer
data and hijacking affiliate programs to earn a referral bonus. Google
said it is increasing efforts in safeguarding brands' reputations and
shielding online shoppers, but bad actors are also constantly evolving
their techniques.

 HOW TO WIN HEARTS WITH 'SURPRISE-DRIVEN' MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A study found that people were more likely to appreciate ‚Äú40%
off‚Äù when the discount is revealed at checkout rather than upfront.
The wrong approach makes users feel like information is being held
hostage, like LinkedIn hiding profile viewers or Bumble pixelating
faces until you pay. The right approach is to embed the element of
surprise into your product while giving users some control and
providing essential information to counterbalance any potential
anxiety. Tactics include using a shuffle or random function,
implementing secret features that users reveal, and randomizing user
experiences.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 GREAT VS TERRIBLE USES FOR A/B TESTING (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A/B tests allow you to measure more accurately at the cost of making
projects take longer. A/B testing is a great idea when there is a
material amount of risk in making the change or an important change
that is tough to detect without testing. It‚Äôs a bad idea when you
are implementing a clear best practice, fixing something that is
broken or unclear, or adding new features that you have clear evidence
that users want. To run an effective A/B testing program, you'll need
a testing tool, correctly configured analytics, sufficient knowledge
of statistics, and the ability to explain results. 

 FREE N-GRAMS TEXT ANALYZER APP FOR SEO (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of ‚Äòn‚Äô items from a given
sample of text or speech. Instead of focusing on single keywords,
n-grams allow search engines to consider the context in which words
are used. The N-Grams Text Analyzer App is free text analyzer app that
shows unique and common n-grams between two bodies of text. It‚Äôs
useful for analyzing why one page ranks better than another,
optimizing your text for better n-grams usage, and featured snippet
optimization. This post includes a link to the tool. 

 SURVEY TOOLS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Tally is good for collecting feedback, market research, and even
selling something. It can incorporate video, images, or descriptions.
Typeform presents questions one by one, making it less overwhelming
for survey respondents than traditional survey tools. Airtable lets
you create forms with responses that flow directly into tables, making
it easier to sort, filter, and share results efficiently. OpinionX is
good for stack rankings. Coda works well for forms and documents and
is more flexible than Survey Monkey or Microsoft Forms.

 THE FAN-DRIVEN MARKETING FLYWHEEL (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Marketing teams often focus so much energy on acquiring new customers
that they miss out on harnessing the power of existing fans. Create
content that truly resonates emotionally with your target audience in
order to start building a fanbase. Identify and interact with vocal
fans. Look for organic opportunities to showcase your most engaged
fans to your whole audience. Whenever a customer reaches out with
thoughtful feedback, make sure to respond personally and respectfully.


 NIGHTSHADE, THE TOOL THAT ‚ÄòPOISONS‚Äô DATA, GIVES ARTISTS A
FIGHTING CHANCE AGAINST AI (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Nightshade, a project from the University of Chicago, aims to empower
artists in the battle against unauthorized AI training by distorting
image data, rendering it unusable for model training. It takes fewer
than 100 poisoned images to start corrupting AI models. The idea is to
protect creators from unauthorized use and force companies to pay to
get consent before using their content to train the models. Glaze,
another tool developed by the same team, prevents AI from being able
to steal artists' styles.
