 MODASH IS FLIPPING THE INFLUENCER MARKETING SCRIPT BY CONNECTING
BRANDS WITH THE LONG TAIL OF CREATORS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Estonian startup Modash, which raised $12 million in Series A
funding, offers an end-to-end influencer marketing platform with a
unique focus on smaller, niche creators rather than traditional
high-follower influencers. The company's platform scrapes public data
to connect brands with over 250 million creators, helping them reach
engaged audiences. Modash aims to disrupt influencer marketing by
emphasizing authentic content from smaller creators, avoiding the

READ) [7] 

 To create impactful content from interviews, engage a diverse group,
including executives for strategic insights and operational staff for
actionable examples. Communicate the content's vision to avoid

transcription and Riverside for video quality. 

 FREEMIUM TO FORTUNE 500: HOW HERE TECHNOLOGIES GREW ITS DEVELOPER
BASE 10X (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 HERE Technologies grew its developer base 10X by switching to a
freemium model, offering 250,000 free API calls per month. This shift
removed the friction of delayed trials, encouraging experimentation
and fostering rapid growth from 50,000 to 500,000 developers in three
years. The hypergrowth also brought challenges, including scaling
support and adapting sales models to identify enterprise prospects
effectively.

 WE STUDIED 200,000 AI OVERVIEWS: HERE'S WHAT WE LEARNED (7 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Only 5% of search results with AI overviews include PPC ads.

with informational queries leading most of the traffic. Ranking in the
top 10 organically offers no guarantee of inclusion in AI overviews,

 THE BIGGEST IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE MISTAKES BUSINESSES MAKE — AND
HOW TO FIX THEM (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Many companies misidentify their customers, leading to wasted
resources and missed opportunities. Rather than guessing or assuming
early adopters and latecomers have the same needs, focus on profitable
customer segments. Define customer roles distinctly as deciders,
payers, and users to avoid targeting inefficiencies. Identifying and
targeting the true decision-makers, who choose the company's solution,
can dramatically improve growth. Accurate customer targeting in the
“customer ecosystem” is fundamental, much like mastering the
basics in a sport. 

 HOW JUNE WINS BY DOING THE OPPOSITE (24 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 June is challenging the complex analytics market by focusing on
radical simplicity, targeting generalists instead of specialists with
intuitive tools. Its founder-led marketing strategy, which prioritizes
personal brands over corporate logos, generates millions of LinkedIn
impressions each month. By stacking micro-strategies — like
simplicity, company-level insights, and audience targeting — June
has carved out a unique, defensible position in a crowded market. 

 I ATTENDED GOOGLE'S CREATOR CONVERSATION EVENT, AND IT TURNED INTO A
FUNERAL (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Creators affected by search algorithm changes voiced frustration over
a lack of transparency on de-ranking at Google's recent Creator
Conversation. Despite attempts by moderator Danny Sullivan to bridge
the gap, Google's executives offered few actionable insights,
sidestepping creators' concerns about small sites' visibility. For
some, the event, set against Google's eerily empty headquarters,
reflected the company's shift away from supporting independent
creators and left them feeling dismissed.
