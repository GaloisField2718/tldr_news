NEWS & TRENDS

 THE ECONOMY IS SO OFF THE RAILS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW
TO MAKE ADS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT AI BOTS (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google is shifting its advertising model to target AI agents instead
of humans. Its new protocol, Agent2Agent, enables bots to communicate
and perform tasks like financial transactions. This reflects a broader
trend where consumers delegate purchases to AI, forcing advertisers
into a confusing and unstable new system. 

 THE RISE OF SONIC BRANDING: HOW SMART COMPANIES ARE CRAFTING THEIR
AUDIO IDENTITY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Brands now invest in sonic logos, custom voice identities, and UX
sound design to communicate values and personality. Advancements in AI
tools like voice cloning and text-to-speech make high-quality audio
branding accessible even to smaller businesses. As screenless
technology expands, sound is positioned to become a core element of
brand identity.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EMPTY SCREENS MAKE MORE MONEY THAN BUSY ONES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 "Word of Sight" is a strategy where products market themselves by
being seen. Shazam's large on-screen logo turns user behavior into
passive promotion, especially in places like concerts and cafes.
Readwise does this on social media by requiring users to tag @readwise
to save tweets, turning each save into a visible promotion. To apply
this, use bold visuals, embed branding into shared content, and make
public actions central to functionality. 

 THE SECRET PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND GIVEAWAYS THAT ACTUALLY CONVERT (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The most successful giveaways focus on psychology, identity, and
connection rather than high price tags. Death Wish Coffee gained
national attention through a contest that offered a life-changing
reward. The most impactful prizes feel exclusive yet achievable and
appeal to what people deeply want but would not buy for themselves.
Giveaways that offer access, align with identity, and feel like gifts
create stronger bonds. Smart brands use them to attract the right
audience and build lasting community and loyalty.

 GOOGLE'S NEW APP ‘DOPPL' LETS YOU VIRTUALLY TRY ON OUTFITS USING AI
(2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Doppl allows users to visualize how clothes would look and move on
their own bodies using just one image. The app extends Google
Shopping's previous try-on features into a standalone experience that
includes personalized avatars, outfit animations, and digital closets.

may shape Google's future retail strategy. 

 TIKTOK LAUNCHES BULLETIN BOARDS FOR BROADCAST MESSAGING FROM CREATOR
AND BRAND PROFILES (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Bulletin Boards is a one-to-many messaging feature that lets creators
and brands share updates through text, images, and videos. Fans can
react but not reply. Similar to Instagram's Broadcast Channels, this
tool supports up to 20 posts per day, each capped at 1,000 characters.
While still in limited testing, some high-profile accounts already
have large followings.

 THE RISE OF THE AI-NATIVE EMPLOYEE (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Lovable hit $80M ARR in just 7 months with only 35 employees by
building a culture around AI-native employees who default to AI for
execution. These employees skip traditional workflows, use AI to build
directly, and own end-to-end execution without coordination
bottlenecks. This speed lowers the cost of failure, encourages
experimentation, and eliminates roles that only exist to manage
process. Velocity, not process, is now the competitive moat. 

 SNHU'S $5M+ HIGH EEAT STRATEGY TO RE-ENGAGE “SOME COLLEGE, NO
CREDENTIAL” STUDENTS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) targets the 43M Americans
with some college but no credentials by focusing on flexible,
transfer-friendly programs. Over 66% of its students bring in prior
credits. Its website drives nearly 950K monthly organic visits, worth
$5.8M in paid traffic, with most traffic coming from informative
subfolders like /about-us/ and /online-degrees/. SNHU ranks well by
following EEAT principles, using faculty quotes, employment data, and
student testimonials. Its embedded YouTube content further engages
users and helps retain SCNC learners who prefer video over text. 

 NAMING EXPERT SHARES THE PROCESS BEHIND CREATING BILLION-DOLLAR BRAND
NAMES (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Many now-iconic names were initially questioned for their relevance
or clarity but succeeded by standing out. The naming process involves
generating many options, deferring judgment, and using linguistic
research to find sounds that evoke traits like trust or innovation. A
well-crafted name builds long-term brand equity by embedding itself in
search, conversation, and product use.
