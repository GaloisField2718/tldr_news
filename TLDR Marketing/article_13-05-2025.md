NEWS & TRENDS

 GOING ‘AI FIRST' APPEARS TO BE BACKFIRING ON KLARNA AND DUOLINGO (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Klarna and Duolingo's AI-first strategies are drawing criticism, with
Klarna backpedaling to rehire support staff after admitting quality
suffered from excessive automation. Duolingo has faced public outrage
on TikTok, where users are accusing it of prioritizing efficiency over
human-led education. While both companies defend their use of AI as a
tool, user sentiment reveals discomfort with automation replacing
people. 

 MARKETING BUDGETS REMAIN CONSTRAINED AMID ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Marketing budgets are expected to stay flat at 7.7% of company
revenue in 2025. This is well below the 11.3% average from 2015 to
2019. Only 30% of chief marketing officers believe they have enough
funding to carry out their strategies, and 79% report pressure to
achieve more with fewer resources. Paid media now takes up 31% of
marketing budgets, but rising ad costs mean returns often fall short,
with 55% of leaders saying their campaigns fail to drive enough sales.
To cope, 39% plan to cut spending on staff and agencies.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 STRUCTURED OR UNSTRUCTURED? (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Structured designs with clean lines led to 39% more clicks for
“effective” product messaging. Playful, unstructured visuals
performed better for “fun” positioning. The findings suggest
consumers subconsciously look for design cues that validate brand
claims. Visual-message alignment matters most before brand familiarity
sets in, shaping how new customers interpret value. 

 BRINGING EQ AND IQ TO MARKETING (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To build deeper brand connections, companies should blend EQ with
data-driven insights. Start by uncovering emotional needs through
qualitative methods, then validate those insights with data. Craft
campaigns that reflect empathy and authenticity, while using data to
fine-tune messaging and delivery across channels. Backed by research
on experiential trends, Airbnb spotlighted belonging and inclusivity
using guest data on travel preferences, while Café Bustelo engaged
culturally Hispanic millennials through pop-ups rooted in community
and heritage.

 GOOGLE I/O: MAY 20 - 21 (EVENT) [8] 

 This year's Google I/O will focus heavily on AI, with major updates
expected across Google's products. The Gemini model family and

highlight how AI is reshaping Search, Android, Cloud, and even Waymo's
self-driving tech. CEO Sundar Pichai, DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, and
other execs will lead sessions, including a talk on AI's role in
revolutionizing Search. Android updates will debut separately during
"The Android Show" a week earlier. 

 THE 40K LINKEDIN FOLLOWERS TECH STACK (2 MINUTE READ) [9]

content workflow. For ideation, Taplio surfaces viral posts, Kleo
analyzes top-performing content from specific creators, and Claude
helps break down why certain posts take off while generating new
angles. For writing and editing, Grammarly polishes content and Notion
serves as a content hub. Canva, Figma, and Ezgif handle visuals, from
beginner-friendly carousels to high-reach GIFs. OpusClip and Screen
Studio are used for creating polished video content, while Taplio and
Notion also help with scheduling and keeping publishing consistent.

 TARIFF UNCERTAINTY CLOUDS OUTLOOK FOR US TELEVISION'S ANNUAL
AD-SELLING BONANZA (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The US television industry's annual upfront ad-selling season is
underway amid economic uncertainty tied to potential tariffs. Analysts
warn it could trigger a recession and depress ad spending. While
NBCUniversal and Fox report stable demand, firms like eMarketer
forecast a $4B drop in traditional TV ad revenue. Brands are cautious
but wary of cutting budgets too sharply, recalling losses from past
downturns. Digital ad spend may stay flat unless tariffs ease, in
which case it could grow. 

 THE GROWTH HACK ERA IS ENDING, ACCORDING TO DIGIDAY'S FORMER
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Digital marketing is shifting away from low-quality, high-volume
tactics driven by performance marketing and AI-generated content,
which is like “peeing in the pool.” The focus must return to
having a great product and earning distribution through word-of-mouth.
While marketers shouldn't abandon effective channels, there is a need
to prepare for declining SEO and build strategies for the next 5
years. Individuals' power is growing over institutions. Brands should
highlight authentic human voices rather than relying on impersonal
messaging. 

 THE RISE, FALL, AND RECOVERY OF FORBES ADVISOR (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google penalized Forbes Advisor for site reputation abuse in
September 2024. This caused traffic to collapse from 24M to near 0 and
triggered layoffs of digital PR, editorial, and SEO staff. By May
2025, traffic had recovered to around 4M monthly visits, with recovery
tied more to category-level link authority than individual pages. The
site's digital PR strategy, which included statistics pages, surveys,
and city indexes, built over 70K referring domains and significantly
contributed to its topical authority. Recovery also involved shifting
toward more user-focused, “Helpful” content and reinforcing the
Forbes brand identity.
