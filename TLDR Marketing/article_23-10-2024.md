creators, 88% have launched a product, and 93% plan to do so within
the next year. Consumers are more inclined to buy from creator-founded
brands than traditional ones, with 71% of U.S. consumers making such

 THE BIG SMALL BUSINESS MARKETING TRENDS REPORT FOR 2025 (10 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Most small businesses prioritize unpaid social media, social media
ads, and search advertising for marketing, but many miss out on key
opportunities like search engine optimization (SEO). Customer
referrals are the top lead source, especially for businesses with 10
or fewer employees. AI is widely used for content creation and other
tasks, but there are risks in relying too heavily on it. Despite
economic challenges, many businesses plan to maintain or increase
their marketing budgets in 2025. Smaller businesses with limited
budgets need to focus on high-impact marketing strategies to maximize
their returns.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE STARBUCKS EFFECT: USE NAMES, NOT ORDER NUMBERS (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Using customer names instead of order numbers can enhance customer
satisfaction and brand preference, especially in businesses with a
personal touch. Research shows people have stronger preferences for
businesses that call out their names rather than using numbers. The
effect works best in human interactions but disappears when orders are
fulfilled by non-human entities, such as software. However, using
names may backfire when customers are purchasing embarrassing
products. Cultural differences and efficiency concerns, such as in
collectivist cultures or when writing names is more complex, could
affect the approach's effectiveness.

to familiar concepts.
