NEWS & TRENDS

 THE AD INDUSTRY IS DUMPING YOUNGER WORKERS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Younger workers are rapidly disappearing from the advertising
industry, with those aged 20-24 making up just 6.5% of the workforce
in 2024, down from 10.5% in 2019. Unemployment among college graduates
aged 22-27 has now surpassed the overall US jobless rate, a reversal
of decades-long trends. Factors like economic uncertainty play a role,
but AI is significantly reducing entry-level opportunities in
marketing and advertising. 

 YOUTUBE WILL START USING AI TO GUESS YOUR AGE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 YouTube is rolling out an AI system to estimate users' ages and
automatically apply teen safety measures for minors. If adults are
misidentified as minors, they must verify their age with a government
ID, credit card, or selfie, raising privacy concerns. The system uses
viewing habits, searches, and account age to make determinations and
currently applies only to logged-in users. This move follows broader
industry efforts to prevent teens from bypassing age restrictions, but
some users worry about sharing sensitive data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO USE DEEP RESEARCH FOR GTM (17 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 By combining good prompting with Deep Research, GTM teams can get
detailed and actionable reports on projects such as marketing
attribution, competitor analysis, or international expansion in a
fraction of the time. The method works best when you provide business
context and force the AI to use credible and recent sources. Different
AI tools excel in different situations, with ChatGPT offering the most
depth, Gemini providing balance, and Perplexity giving strong source
control, making tool choice an important part of the strategy. 

 SEO CHEAT CODES (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Practical SEO strategies for startups include buying expired domains
with backlinks and setting up 301 redirects, listing on high-DA sites
for do-follow links, using Google Ads AI for keyword suggestions, and
generating thousands of blog topics via tools like blogtopics.net and
AnswerThePublic. Creating content around these questions builds
topical authority. Diversifying content types, including programmatic
SEO, free tools, blogs, and interconnected content rings, helps boost
rankings.

 WHAT SEARCH MARKETERS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CHATGPT-5 (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 ChatGPT-5 is faster, more accurate, and more expert-like. To appear
in AI-driven answers, brands must be findable in search engines, cited
across high-quality content, and present across multiple AI platforms.
Brand mentions now matter more than backlinks, and content should be
clear, structured, and semantically relevant. Keywords are less
important than prompts, so build content around the questions real
customers ask, creating a library of high-intent prompts.
