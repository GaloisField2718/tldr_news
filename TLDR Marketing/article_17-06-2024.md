share their expertise and updates on personal social media. Regular

words you use, and a passive one, which contains the words you never
use but understand when you read or hear them. Grow your copywriting
vocab by making note of when you read words that move you to action,
create a document to store useful words and phrases as you come across
them, immerse yourself in good copywriting, and learn the language of
your customers. 

 THE WEEKLY METRICS REVIEW: HOW TO ACTUALLY BE DATA-DRIVEN (11 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 A Weekly Metrics Review meeting covers driver metrics that lead to
revenue, voiced over by the key individuals that own them. The first
step is to identify the metrics to track, which could be new visitors,
sign-ups, free-to-paid conversion, or others. The presenters should
each be accountable for driving the key metrics, which might include
individuals from other teams. It's important to get leadership buy-in
on this approach and to make the metrics easy to pull with an
automated dashboard.
