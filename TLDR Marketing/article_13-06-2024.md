NEWS & TRENDS

 META COULD THREATEN GOOGLE'S SEARCH CROWN (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta, with its extensive reach through WhatsApp, Instagram, and
Facebook, poses a credible threat to Google's search dominance by
potentially redirecting searches to its own results. Unlike ChatGPT
and other AI competitors, Meta's existing ad network and user base
allow it to capitalize on search traffic and disrupt Google's market
share. It is still early, but marketers should be prepared for
potential shifts in search behaviors driven by emerging competitors. 

 TIKTOK COMES FOR GOOGLE AS IT QUIETLY ROLLS OUT IMAGE SEARCH
CAPABILITIES IN TIKTOK SHOP (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TikTok is testing a new image search feature for TikTok Shop that
allows users to find similar products by taking or uploading photos.
The feature directly challenges Google's and Amazon's visual search
capabilities. It aims to increase user engagement and e-commerce
transactions on TikTok by simplifying the shopping process.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO BRING INSIGHTS AND EXPERIMENTS INTO AN OPTIMIZED CUSTOMER
JOURNEY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hipcamp, an RV and camping booking site, shares how its company used
user insights to achieve a 142% YoY growth in bookings from lifecycle
campaigns. It conducted surveys and discovered that 55% of users were
60+ and preferred offline access to information. Hipcamp tested new
messaging strategies and timing, finding that tailored
offline-specific messages sent 1 day prior to trips significantly
improved click-to-install conversion rates. Other experiments, like
dog-specific re-engagement campaigns and image-based abandoned
checkout reminders, also saw improved engagement and conversions. 

 YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T POST JUST ONE PHOTO ON INSTAGRAM (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Single-image posts on Instagram are becoming ineffective compared to
Carousels and Reels. Marketers should convert single-image posts into
Carousels. These offer multiple engagement opportunities since
Instagram can show different images from the same post. They also
generate more engagement, as swiping counts as interaction. 

 7 EXAMPLES OF WELL DONE PRIDE MONTH POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Effective Pride Month posts balance support and authenticity by
highlighting LGBTQ+ voices, sharing company initiatives, and engaging
with audiences through interactive content. Infosys' "Embrace with
Love" video, Accenture's factual "Pride at Accenture," and Amazon's
year-round "Glamazon" events exemplify this approach. By focusing on
genuine stories and inclusive practices, these posts avoid the
pitfalls of over-commercialization and demonstrate a true commitment
to the LGBTQ+ community.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 THE MKT1 GUIDE TO POSITIONING (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Many positioning exercises are overly complex and fail to communicate
the product's value. It's important to distinguish between detailed
product marketing research and the simpler task of writing a clear
positioning statement. Positioning focuses on identifying the target
audience, defining the product, and explaining why it is better than
alternatives. Effective positioning avoids broad and vague
descriptions, instead providing a concise and specific message. Focus
on a primary audience and avoid making a laundry list of features and
benefits. 

 GOOGLE SEARCH NOW SUPPORTS RETURN POLICY MARKUP AT THE
ORGANIZATION-LEVEL (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google Search has added support for return policies at the
organization level, allowing sites to specify a general return policy
for the business instead of having to define one for each individual
product. This can help reduce the size of Product structured data
markup and make it easier to manage return policy markup in one place.
It can also make return policies eligible to show with additional
search results, such as knowledge panels and brand profiles, in
addition to product search results.

 FOGGY FIGURES: SEEING BEYOND MARKETING ATTRIBUTION'S MIRAGE (6 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Marketers have to be realistic about what attribution technology can
do and understand that there's no bulletproof method to know how or
why someone interacted with your campaigns every time. Marketing
attribution data should be used to understand trends and behavior over
time. Realistically, you should aim to know roughly 80% of what drove
participation in each digital campaign. Measuring cumulative
initiatives, like branding, word of mouth, PR, and earned media, can
(and should) be done through market research, customer surveys, web
analytics, media metrics, advertising equivalency value (AVE), and
share of voice.

customer journey. 

 13 SEO TAKEAWAYS FROM GOOGLE'S ELIZABETH TUCKER AT SMX ADVANCED (9
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The March 2024 core update took 45 days due to significant system
changes. There was some re-architecture work and new signals created
to help Google do a better job showing helpful content. SEOs and
content creators still play a vital role in creating valuable websites
and providing feedback to Google. It's important to create helpful and
satisfying content focusing on the big picture rather than technical
details. The definition of low-quality content is detailed in the
Search Quality Rater Guidelines.
