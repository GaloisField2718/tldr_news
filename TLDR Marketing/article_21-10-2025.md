NEWS & TRENDS

 WHAT DOES THE RISE OF CREATOR-LED STOREFRONTS MEAN FOR BEAUTY? (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Creator-led storefronts are changing beauty retail by combining
media, commerce, and influence. Sephora and Condé Nast allow creators
to curate and sell products directly, reducing friction with
integrated checkout and offering competitive commissions. Brands must
treat creator storefronts as both performance and cultural channels,
using community-driven content to drive conversion. Today, creators
serve as the “new shelf space”, connecting awareness to purchase. 

 SOULLESS SOCIAL (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta's Vibes and OpenAI's Sora are flooding platforms with endless,
personalized videos that risk replacing authentic creativity with
algorithm-driven output. These tools deepen the attention economy by
maximizing screen time while worsening issues like loneliness,
burnout, and reduced critical thinking. Even with safeguards such as
likeness controls in Sora, the spread of deepfakes and misleading
media blur the line between reality and fabrication.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE GUIDE TO PRICING PAGE STORYTELLING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Good pricing pages use storytelling to differentiate a company and
guide customers toward decisions. Many companies make mistakes, such
as focusing on product details instead of pricing philosophy,
overloading pricing menus, or neglecting meaningful social proof.
Fixes include leading with a clear pricing philosophy, showcasing only
the most relevant features, and adding context-rich testimonials or
interactive tools that clarify plan value. 

 THE REAL META AD MIX (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Leading advertisers are balancing video and static assets to support
both demand creation and conversion. Static ads are effective for
urgency and personalization, while video builds awareness and intent
over time. Attribution systems often misrepresent video's contribution
to performance by over-crediting lower-funnel conversions. A portfolio
approach that includes both asset types aligns better with long-term
growth and platform diversity.

 HOW TO USE THE USER ID FEATURE IN GOOGLE ANALYTICS (2 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 The User ID feature in GA4 lets you track individual users across
sessions and devices by linking an internal identifier from your CRM
or database, but it requires a login system. To implement it
correctly, assign each user a unique, consistent, non-personal ID,
send it only after login, and reset it to null on logout. Avoid empty
or invalid values, ensure user consent, and don't use User ID as a
custom dimension to prevent data issues. When configured with the
correct reporting identity, GA4 can retroactively connect pre-login
events and enable more accurate tracking and segmentation.

 WHY THE ONION BRAND IS ‘MADE FOR RIGHT NOW' (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Onion is evolving its brand while maintaining its reputation for
sharp, timely satire. It's still pursuing the purchase of InfoWars
after a judge blocked its winning bid, viewing the deal as part of a
strategy to expand into unexpected spaces. The publication has also
launched its own marketing agency, America's Finest Creative Agency,
which attracts clients aligned with its irreverent style rather than
major corporations. It continues to resist using AI in its editorial
work but applies it to business operations to improve campaign
efficiency. 

 SAM'S CLUB SHOWS HOW IN-STORE RETAIL MEDIA SHOULD REALLY WORK (7
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Sam's Club turned in-store retail media into a scalable system by
uniting technology, data, and operations. Its Member Access Platform
connects events, in-club displays, and digital tools through
closed-loop measurement that tracks member behavior to purchase.
Activations like “Race to the Club” and Scan & Go ads prove how
physical spaces drive sales and engagement. 

 BEYOND THE #AD: HOW BRANDS ARE MAKING INFLUENCER MARKETING FEEL REAL
AGAIN (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Influencer marketing is growing as brands focus on authenticity and
smaller creator partnerships. Audiences trust content that feels
genuine, with nano- and micro-influencers achieving higher TikTok
engagement (10.3% and 8.7%) than larger accounts. Product seeding
remains effective, with 92% of marketers saying it boosts awareness
and 76% reporting it drives sales. Brands also expand influence into
real-world communities through events and collaborations, building
loyalty and organic engagement.
