NEWS & TRENDS

 A DECLINING INTERNET (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The internet's quality has declined due to Google prioritizing
short-term ad revenue over long-term sustainability. Increased ad
density, shifting algorithms, and revenue-driven tactics have harmed
user experience and publishers. This led to a shrinking market for
quality content, media consolidation, and dominance by a few large
players. AI-generated answers often lack clear sourcing, while
Google's control of data and preferential treatment of its own
properties have sparked regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits. The
ecosystem supporting diverse content is being increasingly strained. 

 DISTINCTIVE ASSETS SUPERCHARGE LOW ATTENTION MEDIA (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Distinctive brand assets make digital ads 2.5X more effective in
low-attention digital environments. A study of 20K views across 72
video ads found that 85% of digital ad inventory receives less than
2.5 seconds of attention. With strong branding, memory benefits can
appear at just 1.5 seconds, compared to the usual 2.5-second
threshold. Established brands saw a 17% lift in short-term ad strength
with distinctive assets, while growth brands saw a 7% lift.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SHOULD YOU PUT PRICING ON YOUR LANDING PAGE? (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A recent test looked at whether including pricing on a SaaS landing
page would affect lead quality and conversions. Two nearly identical
demo request pages were used, one with pricing information and one
without. The page with pricing saw 8.7% fewer leads but a 21.4%
increase in lead-to-opportunity conversions, while average deal size
and total pipeline impact stayed the same. The findings showed that
sharing pricing helped attract more qualified buyers and discouraged
casual browsers. Those who filled out the form were more likely to be
ready to buy. 

 HOW DOCUSIGN EVOLVED FROM POINT SOLUTION TO PLATFORM (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Docusign shifted from an e-signature tool to a full agreement
management platform by launching Intelligent Agreement Management
(IAM), which includes Maestro, eSignature, and Navigator. The team
built a new user-based pricing model from scratch, using research and
feedback to align pricing with how customers use the product. Over 10K
customers adopted IAM within the first year, driven by upsells and new
interest in contract automation and intelligence. Key lessons include
using pricing to reflect platform evolution, involving customers
early, and avoiding common growth traps like disjointed add-ons or
bloated core products.

 WANT BETTER MARKETING OUTPUT FROM YOUR AI TOOLS? (4 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Use real customer data as input instead of generic prompts to improve
results from AI tools. Instead of just asking AI for general headline
ideas, give it detailed information about your audience. For instance,
knowing that 55% of visitors to a wireframing tool website are
engineers allowed an AI to suggest headlines that speak directly to
them. Using audience insights from tools like SparkToro, Google Search
Console, or Similarweb can make AI outputs more specific, useful, and
worth testing compared to general inputs. 

 THE DECLINE OF ECOMMERCE SEARCH ADS: ARE SHOPPING CAMPAIGNS TO BLAME?
(3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google is prioritizing Shopping over traditional search ads,
investing heavily in AI-powered tools and testing new features such as
a multi-row Shopping Ads carousel. As a result, traditional search ads
are losing visibility, control, and relevance, particularly for
ecommerce brands. Search results pages now display predominantly
product-based content, reducing the prominence of text-based ads.
While Search still has value for complex queries and brand protection,
ecommerce marketers should prioritize Shopping campaigns.

 SYNTHETIC POPULATIONS: HOW AI SIMULATES POPULATIONS AND PREDICTS
BEHAVIOR (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Synthetic populations use AI to simulate human behavior by creating
digital replicas of real-world demographics and layering in behavioral
models and real-world calibration. McDonald's can now test how
economic policies may affect customer behavior without conducting
costly surveys. Use cases span corporate strategy, policy testing,
healthcare, insurance, media, and even jury selection. One study
showed AI-generated personas replicated 76% of results from real human
studies. 

 EVERYONE IS THINKING ABOUT SUBSCRIPTIONS WRONG (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Indie media subscriptions are not commodities to be compared by cost
per journalist. They're investments in meaningful relationships
between readers and creators. Readers pay not for volume but for
connection, trust, and access to unique perspectives. While platforms
like Substack take 10% of revenue and legacy media offers more content
per dollar, those metrics miss the point. The value lies in supporting
independent voices that reflect personal values, build community, and
offer a direct stake in a more diverse media future.
