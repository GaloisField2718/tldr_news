STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 7 KEYS TO UNLOCK A FLOOD OF HIGH-QUALITY REFERRALS (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Referrals attract your ideal clients, shorten your sales process,
command premium fees, and dramatically increase customer lifetime
value. Yet, while over 80% of people say they'd be thrilled to refer
businesses they love, less than 30% actually do. Tactics to generate
more referrals include presenting a referral offer to every client,
creating a champion program of raving fans, generating referrals from
your employees, building a strategic partner network, and launching
your own networking hub. For B2B companies specifically, you can also
offer client benefit calls to customers' trusted advisors or teach
referral marketing.

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE GENERATION EFFECT: IMPROVE BRAND RECALL (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Generation Effect explains why we remember something more when we
put more effort into recalling it. For example, a 2020 study found
that people were more likely to remember brand names with a single
missing letter, compared to fully spelled-out brand names. To take
advantage of this principle, use hidden letters in your next ad,
incentivize active participation in your product, or make your social
media posts interactive. 

 DOES GOOGLE'S ‚ÄúSITE REPUTATION ABUSE‚Äù POWER ENDANGER ALL OF US?
(3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google's new policy on ‚Äúsite reputation abuse‚Äù, effective May 5,
de-ranks third-party coupon pages on popular sites. It views them as
spam meant to manipulate search rankings. This change impacts large
news and lifestyle publishers who rely on high-margin revenue from
these pages. The decision has sparked debate within the affiliate
space, with some supporting Google's move and others defending
third-party coupon pages. Despite Google's dominance, new players like
Amazon and TikTok are driving innovation and collaboration. The $150B
US digital coupon market emphasizes the potential for growth through
strategic partnerships.
