 THE HARD TRUTH ABOUT AI IN MARKETING (SPONSOR) [4]

another dashboard. Spark™ fuses proprietary brand intelligence, live
market signals, competitive benchmarks, and real-time sentiment to

 THE RISE OF THE CONTENT ENGINEER: REDEFINING MARKETING IN THE NEXT
ERA (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Unlike traditional marketers who create individual assets, content
engineers build AI-powered systems that scale content across channels.
They embed brand voice into processes, orchestrate cross-platform
ecosystems, design feedback loops that optimize performance, and scale
personalization while keeping strategy intact. As martech moves from
human-centric tools to agent-based systems, companies that adopt
content engineering will gain an edge. 

 TRUMP'S ‘NO TAX ON TIPS' POLICY IS A WIN FOR INFLUENCERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Trump's new “no tax on tips” policy opens an unexpected win for
influencers and digital creators. Podcasters, streamers, and other
online creators can now deduct up to $25K in tips, making platforms
with tip-based revenue models more attractive. This new policy
strengthens the financial case for mid-tier creators to scale tipping
features and experiment with direct audience monetization.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW MANY ADS IS TOO MANY? (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The old limit of 6 ads per ad set on Meta is no longer as relevant.
With the rollout of the Andromeda system and new creative AI tools,
Meta now promotes creative diversification across formats, styles, and
messaging angles. Advertisers are seeing success with ad sets
containing up to 50 ads, thanks to Meta's ability to handle variation
more intelligently. Meta's new algorithmic approach appears less
sensitive to budget thresholds, allowing broad testing without the old
distribution penalties. 

 INSIDE PEACH & LILY'S UNCONVENTIONAL INFLUENCER MARKETING STRATEGY (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Peach & Lily's latest launch skipped the usual influencer playbooks
and opted for a blind test approach. The brand sent its new product in
unbranded bottles to 14 experts across dermatology, esthetics, and
cosmetic chemistry. These influencers received minimal ingredient
details and were invited to share authentic first impressions on
TikTok and Instagram before any brand name was disclosed. The content
had no trending audio or effects and leaned fully into face-to-camera
education. The campaign generated 5X the engagement of previous
efforts and racked up over 1M impressions within two hours of the
reveal at a New York City launch event.

 HOW TO USE THE REDDIT PIXEL FOR RETARGETING ADS THAT FILL YOUR FUNNEL
(9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Reddit Pixel lets brands track behavior and run retargeting
campaigns that re-engage high-intent visitors at a fraction of cold
campaign costs. Retargeting works on Reddit because 42% of users say
it influences purchase decisions more than any other channel. With
CPCs of $0.50-3 versus LinkedIn's $7-12, Reddit offers a
cost-effective way to nurture leads and drive conversions over longer
sales cycles. 

 EXPANDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY WITH AI (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI is building a Jobs Platform to match AI-trained workers with
companies, including small businesses and local governments, and
launching OpenAI Certifications to validate AI proficiency through the
free OpenAI Academy. With a goal of certifying 10 million Americans by
2030, starting with partners like Walmart, these initiatives aim to
make AI training accessible, relevant, and tied directly to workforce
needs.

 AI OPTIMIZATION TEST: FOOTERS ARE BACK LIKE 2003 (3 MINUTE READ) [14]


 AI search models often prioritize small repeated signals like website
footers over traditional high-quality efforts such as conferences or
press releases. Seer Interactive ran a test that showed how updating
its footer influenced ChatGPT results in just 36 hours. The company
also found that owning a larger share of citations on its own domain
allowed faster updates in AI answers compared to competitors who rely
on third-party sites. Building connections with influential external
sites and awards helps shape how AI presents a brand. 

 RETAIL MEDIA UNPACKED: WILL ADS IN AI KILL RETAIL MEDIA? (5 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 AI agents could disrupt the retail media market if offline shopping
shifts online faster and consumers adopt agent-driven purchasing. Ads
in Copilot have 73% higher click-through rates, 16% stronger
conversion rates, and 33% shorter purchase journeys than traditional
search. In cases with purchase intent, Copilot increased purchases
within 30 minutes by 53%. This performance threatens retail media's
core revenue streams, particularly on-site and off-site advertising.
For now, adoption of AI-enabled shopping is limited, leaving a window
for retailers and brands to adapt.
