NEWS & TRENDS

 BUZZFEED IS LAUNCHING A NEW SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK. WHY? (7 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 BuzzFeed is launching BF Island, a social media platform designed as
an AI-driven alternative to algorithm-heavy networks. CEO Jonah
Peretti wants it to be a space for creative expression, especially for
women and LGBTQ+ users, in contrast to the "masculine energy" of
platforms like X and Meta. The platform will focus on interactive
storytelling and self-expression rather than engagement-driven
content. 

 FROM PROMPT TO PRODUCT: THE RISE OF AI-POWERED WEB APP BUILDERS (12
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI-powered website and app builders like Bolt, Lovable, and V0 enable
no-code product creation. They replace traditional coding with text
and design-based workflows. Some allow code exports, while others lock
users in. These tools simplify prototyping but make debugging complex
projects challenging.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO LEVERAGE 18 FAVORITE ‘OLD SCHOOL' MARKETING TACTICS (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Old-school marketing tactics still work when adapted to modern
channels. Tactics like direct mail, storytelling, and word-of-mouth
remain effective by cutting through digital noise. Personalized
letters, handwritten notes, and executive-signed messages help brands
connect with their audience, while PR stunts and storytelling in press
releases drive media engagement. When integrated with digital
strategies, these approaches enhance trust, credibility, and brand
recall. 

 THE BEST AUTOMATED GTM PLAYS YOU'RE NOT RUNNING (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI-powered automation in GTM doesn't have to be a volume game. It can
be used to increase precision by using real-time signals to target
high-intent prospects. Plays like warm outbound to recent website
visitors, product-led outreach to engaged users, and expansion
campaigns based on usage data increase efficiency without sacrificing
quality. Stacking multiple signals and leveraging AI-driven insights
can drive 5–10x higher conversion rates than traditional outbound.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 INSTAGRAM SEO: WHAT IT IS, HOW TO DO IT, & BEST PRACTICES (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Instagram SEO works by matching searches with profiles, captions, and
hashtags while factoring in engagement and past interactions. Brands
can improve discoverability by optimizing profiles with relevant
keywords, writing alt text, using subtitles, and posting at peak
engagement times. Higher engagement signals, such as likes and
comments, increase the chances of appearing in search and
recommendations. 

 OPENAI LAYS OUT PLANS FOR GPT-5 (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Sam Altman aims to simplify OpenAI's product lineup. GPT-4.5,
internally called Orion, will be OpenAI's last non-chain-of-thought
model. The company plans to unify its o-series and GPT-series models,
integrating tools for broader usability. GPT-5 will replace o3 as a
standalone model, offering different intelligence levels based on user
tiers. Altman hinted at a release timeline of weeks or months.

 THE SHIFT TO ACCOUNT-DRIVEN GTM (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Companies should shift to an account-driven go-to-market (GTM)
strategy due to advances in data and technology. This strategy
involves mapping your total addressable market (TAM), segmenting
accounts by fit and intent, and using intent signals to prioritize
outreach and create personalized campaigns. It differs from
traditional account-based marketing (ABM) and inbound marketing by
integrating broader, proactive engagement across marketing and sales
teams. The strategy relies on unifying account data, leveraging new
tools for speed, and tailoring marketing tactics to account value.
Startups that fail to adopt this approach may struggle against
competitors in today's B2B environment. 

 WHY EVERYONE'S FIGHTING ABOUT WHERE PRODUCT MARKETING BELONGS (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The debate over whether Product Marketing is a subset of Marketing
centers on the need for specialization. While both roles are
strategic, Marketing focuses on growth and market presence, whereas
Product Marketing drives market fit and category perception. Treating
them as interchangeable creates confusion and burnout, particularly in
startups. The key is recognizing their distinct roles to improve
collaboration, avoid mixed messaging, and scale effectively. Both
functions are crucial and deserve their own seat at the table.

treating physical retail as a media channel, Lego turns stores into
immersive experiences, from holiday-themed displays to digital
workshops. The company is also leveraging its employees for live
streaming, connecting online and in-person shopping.
