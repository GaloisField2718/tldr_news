NEWS & TRENDS

 GEN Z IS ALMOST 30: WHY MARKETERS NEED TO RETHINK EVERYTHING THEY
KNOW ABOUT YOUTH CULTURE (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Gen Z is almost 30 and leading culture, while Gen Alpha is already
shaping trends and household spending. Both generations expect brands
to go beyond surface-level purpose and empty trends. They demand real
values built into everything from products to policies. They want
brands that entertain and connect authentically, with content that
ranges from quick, catchy moments to meaningful stories across
different platforms. These groups also care deeply about social issues
and sustainability, and they expect brands to show, not just say,
their commitment. If a brand can't keep up with their evolving tastes
and cultural influence, it risks being left behind.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE B2B MESSAGING PYRAMID (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This 4-step model creates homepage copy that resonates by aligning
with what buyers need to hear. It starts by understanding the buyer's
context, including who they are and the situation they face, and then
identifies the core friction that makes their current state
unsustainable. Next, it presents a strategic unlock, bridging their
pain to the transformation your solution enables, followed by proving
why you are the best choice to deliver that shift. By moving from
audience context to specific problems, then to the solution and your
unique fit, this approach ensures messaging is relevant. 

 WIN REPORT: HOW SIMPLIFYING A MODAL INCREASED TRANSACTIONS BY 13% (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Simplifying a website's confirmation modal increased checkout page
visits by 21% and overall transactions by 13% for a company selling
sustainably harvested countertops. The original modal contained
upsells, email capture, and multiple value propositions, which
analytics showed caused a significant drop-off. The new version
featured a larger product image, fewer details, no upsells, and two
clear calls to action. The results showed that removing unnecessary
elements reduced friction and improved conversions. 

 THE FUTURE OF APP STORE OPTIMIZATION (ASO): ADAPTING TO INTELLIGENT
DISCOVERY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ASO is moving from static keyword playbooks to adaptive, AI-powered
growth engines. Search results are now tailored to the individual,
meaning the same query can result in different listings. Winning
brands will personalize product pages, adopt AI-driven metadata
updates, and optimize for voice and predictive discovery. Marketers
should treat ASO like a performance channel, running rapid experiments
and signaling app use cases clearly to surface at the right moments.
