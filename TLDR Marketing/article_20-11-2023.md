 BUYING TRIGGERS: HOW TO CREATE GROWTH FROM NON-OBVIOUS DEMAND (5
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A buying trigger is a situation or event that makes someone willing
to make a purchase. By identifying the context of when a person
decides to purchase a product, brands can understand what matters to
the customer at that moment and optimize marketing. Brands can also
claim a non-obvious buying trigger for their product. For example, Kit
Kat linked its product to taking a break, while Rolex connected its
product to moments of accomplishment. 

 HOW REDDIT GREW ORGANIC TRAFFIC FROM 69M TO 200M MONTHLY SESSIONS IN
5 MONTHS (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Reddit saw very little growth in organic traffic over the past 5
years despite the amount of user-generated content (UGC) on the
platform. However, it has seen a huge increase and seemingly benefited
from every core algorithm update in the past 5 months. This is likely
part of a larger trend where Google is starting to favor more UGC and
first-hand experience in SERPs.
