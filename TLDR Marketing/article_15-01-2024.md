STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOU SHOULD POST YOUR BEST SOCIAL CONTENT AGAIN AND AGAIN (2 MINUTE
READ) [7]

performers. Small brands tend to hit a 32% reach rate (number of
people who‚Äôve seen your post/followers), while brands in the 500K
range strike a 12% reach rate. This translates to 68-88% of followers
not seeing any one post in particular. Brands are advised to go
through their top 50 posts to see what‚Äôs evergreen and to use those
top performers every year.

 DO YOU NEED TO USE HASHTAGS ON LINKEDIN? (3 MINUTE READ) [9]

work on LinkedIn the way they do on other apps.

MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This founder built a SaaS company with zero funding and zero dollars
in ad spend while boasting raving customers and profitability. It
started when one of his e-commerce clients came to him needing a way

many third-party integrations as possible as a natural sales function
and now also has a team focused on building content.
