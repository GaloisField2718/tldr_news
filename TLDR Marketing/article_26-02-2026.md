 THIS IS AN INTERVENTION: YOU'RE POSTING TOO MUCH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Platforms are fragmenting, but spamming volume won't help you squeeze
more out of social. If anything, that extra content creates drag, not
momentum. 

Sprout Social's 2026 Social Media Content Strategy Report [5] lays out
how high-performing teams are adjusting priorities as the social
landscape shifts.

 PINTEREST PARENTING TREND REPORT 2026: RAISING SCREEN‑SMART KIDS
WHO SEEK REAL-WORLD ADVENTURE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Parents are embracing experience-rich, screen-smart childhoods.
Pinterest searches for “screen free activities” are up 200% and
“no phone summer” up 340%. Families are blending screens into
shared activities like movie nights and sports. They're rethinking
parenting with slower, kinder approaches and using nostalgia, DIY
projects, and creative home setups to enrich daily life. 

 WHY DO WE STILL CALL THEM PODCASTS? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Video podcasts are reshaping the medium and raising questions about
whether the term “podcast” still fits. Once defined as on-demand
audio shows, podcasts now include episodic video content. Most
audiences mix listening and watching, with only 7% exclusively
watching and 13% exclusively listening. Video podcasts are expanding
into formats traditionally dominated by TV, blending performance,
storytelling, and social media elements. Even so, the word
“podcast” continues to stick, even as the format evolves.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY LIFE MOMENTS, NOT DEMOGRAPHICS, SHOULD DRIVE YOUR TARGETING
STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many brands focus on age and income, but purchase decisions are
driven by life events like marriage, relocation, parenthood, or career
changes. Consumers with the same demographics can have opposite
intent, making broad-segment messaging and traditional loyalty models
less effective. Strategies that combine life event signals with
behavioral data and optimize for lifetime value across stages perform
better. 

 CONTENT STRATEGY THAT BUILDS PIPELINE: DISCOVERY, VIRALITY, AND
RELATIONSHIP LOOPS (43 MINUTE PODCAST) [10] 

 B2B content often produces lots of output but little impact because
the pieces aren't connected. This podcast shares a four-part framework
that can fix this. Content IP focuses on naming the buyer's real,
often unspoken problem to build trust. Discovery loops make sure
prospects can find your content through search, competitor
comparisons, and product pages. Virality loops keep content visible by
having real people consistently share stories, not just brand accounts
posting updates. Relationship loops use recurring touchpoints like
newsletters, webinars, or podcasts to deepen trust over time. When all
four work together, content shifts from a task list into a growth
engine.

 DESIGNING EXPERIMENTS FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH (WEBINAR) [11] 

 This webinar will discuss experiment best practices and common
mistakes that can lead to critical misinformation. The marketing team
at GrowthBook will be sharing real examples of experimentation gone
wrong and done right. It will take place on March 3 at 12 PM ET. 

 STUDY: HOW ANSWERING PEOPLE ALSO ASK QUESTIONS CORRELATES WITH
ORGANIC RANKINGS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Pages that fully answer more People Also Ask questions tend to rank
higher in the top 5 organic results. This study analyzed 563 keywords
and found the strongest correlations for commercial and transactional
queries, such as a top 5 correlation of -0.9573 for transactional
searches. Informational and navigational queries showed weaker
relationships, and the correlation dropped sharply beyond page 1.
Answering PAA questions alone does not guarantee rankings because
technical quality, external signals, and user experience still matter.
Broad question coverage can make content semantically richer and may
support stronger ranking potential.

 SHOULD I QUIT MY JOB? A FLOWCHART (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Going freelance is appealing, but it requires honest self checks. The
first step is to confirm you truly want independence rather than
simply wanting a better version of your current job. Early validation
matters, so having at least one paying client before quitting can
reduce risk. Expect about 20% of your time to go to admin work and
about 30% to pipeline building, which leaves roughly 50% for the craft
itself. Most new freelancers also need 3-6 months of savings and a
clear specialty. 

 PRODUCTS ARE EVALUATED TWICE NOW (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Products now face two separate evaluations during buying decisions,
relevance first and feasibility second. Awareness content still drives
interest, but buyers often research technical fit on their own using
AI and cross-functional review before contacting sales. Many teams
fail because key answers live in operational documents that are not
structured for buyers who are still deciding. Teams should map buyer
roles to the depth of context they need and design intentionally gated
materials that connect marketing to technical validation. Companies
that build clear bridges between attention and fit will reduce
friction and help serious buyers move faster. 

 THE UNILEVER CEO HAS A NEW MARKETING DOCTRINE, AND IT IS COMPLETELY
WRONG (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Unilever's CEO has declared traditional advertising dead and shifted
toward a “social-first, creator-led” approach. However, this
ignores the realities of brand growth. Evidence shows big-brand,
mass-reach campaigns remain essential for reaching new buyers, while
creators are better at engaging existing fans. Applying a single
strategy across 400 diverse brands repeats past mistakes and risks
undermining brands that need broad reach.
