NEWS & TRENDS

 DISCOVERABILITY IS THE GAMING INDUSTRY'S "ACHILLES' HEEL," MARKETING
SURVEY FINDS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bastion's G2M Video Games Marketing Survey shows that discoverability
is the biggest challenge for publishers and developers. 94.4% of
respondents expect it to remain their top issue this year. Despite
63.9% of companies having over a decade of publishing experience, most
have marketing teams of only 1-5 people, and just 36.1% believe their
current budget is adequate. Budgets are tightening, and companies are
shifting strategies, with many finding organic influencer marketing as
the most effective channel and paid media as the least effective. 

 AMAZON EXITS GOOGLE SHOPPING GLOBALLY CAUSING 30% CPC COLLAPSE (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Amazon's exit from Google Shopping in July instantly reduced its
presence from dominant market share to complete absence across the US,
Europe, and Japan. This sudden change in auctions drove cost savings
of about 25% to 30% for other advertisers and marked the company's
boldest advertising strategy shift since its temporary withdrawal
during the 2020 lockdowns.

 5 SAAS GROWTH STRATEGIES THAT WORK (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Progressive Squeeze gradually increases upgrade prompts as users
engage more, while the Feature Tease displays gated premium features
to spark curiosity and FOMO. The Moment of Need tactic surfaces
upgrade options when users are most invested, and the Transparent
Countdown builds trust by clearly showing limits and resets. The
Omnipresent Nudge integrates multiple contextual upgrade touchpoints
across the interface. 

 HOW TO MARKET ON REDDIT: WHY BRANDS FAIL AND HOW TO SUCCEED (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 With over 110M daily users, Reddit rewards genuine contributions and
punishes anything staged. It's a trust-based economy where
recommendations carry real weight. Brands like 1Password have
succeeded by building communities and engaging transparently, while
others face backlash for inauthentic tactics. Successful brands are
led by people who understand internet culture, value transparency over
control, and engage in unscripted conversations.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 GOOGLE ADS TO END MANUAL LANGUAGE TARGETING IN SEARCH CAMPAIGNS (1
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google Ads will remove manual language targeting for Search campaigns
by year-end, shifting fully to AI-driven detection based on user
signals. Non-Search campaigns like Display and YouTube remain
unchanged. While this move simplifies setup and may improve targeting
accuracy, it reduces advertiser control and risks misaligned
placements. 

 VIBE MARKETING STATISTICS – GROWTH & USAGE TRENDS (6 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Searches for “vibe marketing” rose 686% in the past year, and
nearly 47% of Fortune 500 companies now use it. VIBE stands for
Velocity, Identity, Boundaryless, and Emotions first. Velocity means
moving at cultural speed, Identity aligns campaigns with who consumers
want to be, Boundaryless blends brand and product into a seamless
experience, and Emotions first focuses on triggering specific feelings
before crafting messages.

 IS YOUR FAVORITE SOCIAL MEDIA SITCOM ACTUALLY A MARKETING CAMPAIGN?
(3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Bilt created the scripted series “Roomies” as a marketing
campaign without featuring its brand in the first nine episodes. It
has drawn 3.2M combined views on Instagram and TikTok without paid
promotion. The company used a separate account for the show to align
with social algorithms and avoid overtly promotional content. Bilt
plans to eventually integrate its partners, such as Barry's gym, into
the storyline. Other brands like Alexis Bittar, InStyle, and Sephora
are also using episodic social content to connect with audiences, with
some reporting strong community response and product sales tied to
their series. 

 BRAND ADVERTISING ON NEWS SITES ISN'T RISKY, IT'S ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Roughly 80M US adults closely follow the news, making them a highly
desirable audience for advertisers. Studies show “news junkies”
have 16 percentage points higher purchase intent than the general
population and stronger trust and favorability toward brands. Yet many
advertisers avoid news sites due to outdated brand safety fears,
missing out on a demographic that includes most business leaders.
Evidence shows ads in news perform just as well as those placed in
entertainment, sports, or lifestyle content.
