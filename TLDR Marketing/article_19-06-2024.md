 WHITE PAPER: AI CONTENT & SEARCH (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Contrary to the claim that AI content is flooding the web, only about
3% of pages are purely AI-generated content. Crypto, Commerce,
Finance, and Local pages have the most, with roughly 20% of their URLs
featuring AI-generated content. A page's average rank decreases as the
amount of AI-generated content increases ‚Äî suggesting that
human-written content performs better in search. 

 WHAT'S NEXT IN VIDEO ADVERTISING? (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Despite the fact that digital and streaming video account for 70% of
viewing hours, less than half of video advertising spend goes to those
channels. This discrepancy represents more than $20B in advertising
spend that could be better allocated. Unified video is set to
revolutionize video advertising by integrating planning, buying, and
measurement across channels. Key tactics include defining a single
strategic audience, selecting channels based on reach and quality, and
calibrating planning tools with in-market test results.

 HOW STREAMLINING SUBSCRIPTIONS INCREASED SALES BY 18% (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 VectorVest, a stock portfolio management system, found that many
users stalled at the second step of its signup flow, which was
selecting a subscription plan. This step asked users to choose between
3 plans based on an extensive list of features that were either
included or excluded. The team tested removing this second step
entirely while still giving users the option to switch plans on the
final step to reduce cognitive load and analysis paralysis. This
resulted in an 18% increase in sales.

 WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE RISE OF ALTERNATIVE VOICES AND NEWS
INFLUENCERS IN SOCIAL AND VIDEO NETWORKS? (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube have facilitated the rise of a diverse
range of voices, challenging mainstream media. Alternative voices
often present partisan views and have significant followings,
especially among younger audiences. Influencers like Tucker Carlson,
Joe Rogan, and Dylan Page illustrate this shift. These influencers
often focus on video formats and cater to younger demographics with
political commentary or lifestyle updates. Traditional media needs to
improve trust, diversity, and digital storytelling to remain
competitive.
