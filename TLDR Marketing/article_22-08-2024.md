 YOUTUBE TAKES ON TIKTOK SHOP WITH EXPANDED SHOPIFY PARTNERSHIP (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 YouTube has enhanced its partnership with Shopify in response to
TikTok's rapid growth in U.S. e-commerce, enabling creators to access
a much wider range of brands through its Shopping affiliate program.
This expansion is part of YouTube's broader strategy to increase
revenue from e-commerce as digital advertising slows, with new tools
like a Chrome extension making it easier for creators to incorporate
products into their content. By boosting the number of brands
available and streamlining the shopping experience, YouTube aims to
solidify its position against competitors like TikTok Shop. 

 MARKETERS' AD SPEND TO GROW IN H2 LED BY SOCIAL MEDIA AND DISPLAY (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The sense of optimism felt by the ad industry in the first half of
2024 is expected to endure, with a significant number of advertisers
midway through the year reporting that they again plan to maintain or
increase their spending in every channel. 56% of marketers listed
connected TV (CTV) and streaming as the most critical consumer
technology and media trend, followed by generative artificial
intelligence (AI) at 55%. Meanwhile, the amount of time spent
streaming increased by more than 40% in June, marking its largest
share of TV usage ever recorded.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AIRBNB'S 2024 CAMPAIGN IS A POWERFUL EXAMPLE OF HOW GREAT MARKETING
IS JUST POSITIONING MADE VISIBLE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In order to build value propositions that really resonate with your
target customer segments, you need to understand what they are doing
today (and why that method sucks). Airbnb's series of 8 commercials
explain when and why it's the better choice for a particular group of
people, for a particular subset of trips. This post includes a brief
teardown of positioning and messaging for each of the 8 Airbnb
commercials. 

 USER TESTING: THE TECHNIQUES WE USE TO MAKE MILLIONS FOR OUR CLIENTS
(10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 User testing is by far the fastest and most effective way to find the
issues that limit website conversion rates and revenue. There are five
levels of user testing to consider: testing on yourself, testing on
someone with fresh eyes, testing with qualified users, testing with
prospects who are on your website right now, and testing competitor
websites alongside your own. Common issues found from these methods
include users making ‚Äústupid‚Äù mistakes, users not trusting you (or
believing your claims), or users hitting a sticking point and stalling
(or leaving).

 SELF-CARE SOCIALS: GEN Z'S EMERGING GUIDE TO MAKING FRIENDS (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Gen Z's social life has moved away from traditional gatherings like
happy hours and sports events. They're now spent in novel, digitally
mediated spaces such as in-game hang-outs and virtual school
environments. This change highlights the emergence of new social
settings centered around self-care, like book bars and skincare cafes,
which are cozy and interest-focused. There will be a new generation of
brands that position themselves as low-key, self-care-specific, and
social-but-not-quite. 

 YOUR TV SET HAS BECOME A DIGITAL BILLBOARD. AND IT'S ONLY GETTING
WORSE (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Rather than selling as many TVs as possible, TV manufacturers are
increasingly seeking recurring revenue from already-sold TVs via ad
sales and tracking. Some brands already prioritize data collection and
the ability to sell ads and most are trying to boost their appeal to
advertisers. Smart TV OS providers are generating revenue by licensing
their software and through revenue sharing of in-app purchases and
subscriptions. Budget TVs are the leaders in this trend as companies
often offset cheap hardware prices with ads and data collection.
