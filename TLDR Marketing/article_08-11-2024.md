 ARGUING OVER CREDIT DOESN'T DRIVE GROWTH. KNOWING WHAT WORKS DOES
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Buyers do much more than click on ads. They engage with your content
on social media. They read your blog. They meet you at in-person
events.

But if none of that gets measured, you don't know what's working. You
can't track the wins you influenced; justifying your budget is much
harder; and most importantly, you don't know what really drives
growth.

HockeyStack [4] replaces hunches and feelings with modern attribution,
holistic buyer journeys, and account insights. In other words: cold
hard data [4] that lets you confidently answer ‚Äúwhat's working‚Äù
across both sales and marketing as a unified team.

NEWS & TRENDS

 AUSTRALIA TO BAN SOCIAL MEDIA FOR KIDS UNDER 16 (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A proposed new law in Australia will prohibit social media access for
users under 16, with platforms like Instagram and TikTok expected to
enforce the restrictions. Prime Minister Albanese says there is a need
for societal standards in online safety. The government will work on
age verification measures over the next year. The law is set to be
introduced in two weeks and will take effect 12 months after it
passes. 

 CANADA ORDERS SHUTDOWN OF TIKTOK OFFICES OVER SECURITY RISKS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Canada has ordered the closure of TikTok's offices, citing national
security concerns linked to ByteDance's operations. The ban does not
extend to the app itself, so users and businesses are allowed to
continue engaging with it. The decision, which will impact hundreds of
jobs, follows scrutiny over data privacy and a government device ban
in 2023.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 JOURNALIST REQUESTS: HOW TO FIND THEM AND RESPOND FOR COVERAGE (10
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Use journalist requests to earn media placement and backlinks as a
strategic alternative to traditional PR pitching. Platforms like HARO,
Qwoted, and Source of Sources facilitate this by connecting
journalists with experts quickly and efficiently. Responding fast -
ideally within 24 hours - is key, as journalists often close requests
early once they have suitable sources. Avoid using AI for responses,
as journalists prefer unique, authentic insights and are adept at
spotting generic replies. Establishing credibility by highlighting
expertise and pairing pitches with relevant data can further boost
success rates. 

 4 TIPS TO INCREASE HOMEPAGE LEADS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Make sure your visitors know exactly what happens next by detailing
what a demo, trial, or strategy call includes and its benefits. Use
microcopy near CTAs to address potential objections with phrases like
‚Äúcommitment-free‚Äù or ‚Äú45-min session.‚Äù Build trust by adding
quantified proof points such as ‚Äú150% faster setup‚Äù and back them
up with evidence. Offer risk-reversal guarantees, such as ‚Äú20% CVR
lift in 3 months or you don't pay,‚Äù to reassure potential buyers and
improve conversion rates. 

 CLARITY > CATCHY (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cognism found that shifting to straightforward, detailed messaging on
its homepage with a 106-word H1 + H2 and clear bullet points led to a
40% increase in conversions. This approach focused on answering
essential user questions - what the company does, who it's for, and
why it's better. It proved that informative and functional content can
outperform traditional, vague, or overly inspirational messaging.

 THE ULTIMATE PLAYBOOK FOR MARKETING DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS - PART 2
(10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Marketing channels fail for several common reasons, each with
specific fixes. Misaligned messaging and broad targeting lead to poor
engagement - solutions include tailoring messages to audience
priorities and using niche targeting to reduce acquisition costs.
Budget misallocation drains resources, so reallocating funds based on
ROI can improve results. Channel-specific strategies are crucial since
broadly repurposed content often underperforms. Continual testing and
pivoting - adjusting creatives, audiences, and budgets - helps
marketers optimize performance and adapt to each channel's unique
needs. 

 BRAND PERCEPTION: WHAT IT IS & HOW TO MEASURE IT (6 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Customer perception of a brand goes beyond logos and taglines,
encompassing experiences, values, and social presence. Measuring brand
perception through surveys, reviews, and social media engagement helps
businesses understand their reputation and loyalty drivers. Effective
monitoring enables brands to address customer concerns proactively and
strengthen their market position. 

 THE ROLE OF AD DOLLARS IN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION (2 MINUTE

 Political ad spend hit $10.53 billion in 2024. Trump's victory
involved minimal paid media, calling the impact of political ad
spending into question. Spending leaned heavily on addressable media
such as CTV, while social platforms like Meta saw a 50% drop in ad
spend. This shift highlights a changing landscape where candidate
presence may be as influential as ad spend.
