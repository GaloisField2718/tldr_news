 HOW CHANGING ONE IMAGE ALMOST DOUBLED CONVERSIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [8]

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE MESSENGER EFFECT (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Messenger Effect explains why we‚Äôre more likely to pay
attention to a message when someone we trust delivers it. The human
brain rarely has all the information it needs to make a decision, so
it uses shortcuts to make effective decisions faster. If your
brand‚Äôs message isn‚Äôt landing with prospects and you‚Äôre
confident it‚Äôs solid, don‚Äôt change the message ‚Äî change the
messenger. This could mean using well-known figures, relying on
micro-influencers, or using your existing customers as the messenger.
