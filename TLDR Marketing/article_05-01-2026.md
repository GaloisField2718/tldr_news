NEWS & TRENDS

 YOU CAN NOW HIRE SOMEONE TO RETURN ALL THOSE UNWANTED GIFTS (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A growing post-holiday industry has emerged around paid return
services as shoppers outsource the hassle of returning unwanted gifts
to gig workers and startups like ReturnQueen. Platforms such as
Taskrabbit have reported sharp increases in return-related bookings.
With returns now a standard part of holiday shopping, these services
appeal to people willing to pay for convenience. E-commerce friction
continues to create new demand for labor rather than eliminating it. 

 ADVERTISING WILL BOOM IN 2026, BUT HOLLYWOOD IS AT RISK OF BEING LEFT
BEHIND (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Advertising spend is forecast to rise again in 2026, but most of the
gains will go to tech platforms like Meta, YouTube, and TikTok. TV
continues to lose share despite stable topline figures, and even
streaming growth is slowing. Entertainment companies are trying to
attract smaller advertisers through programmatic tools, but face a
structural disadvantage against digital platforms.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 5 PRICING IDEAS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SaaS companies are using pricing and packaging changes to guide
upgrades and add value without cutting list prices. One company cut a
Pro AI discount from 50% to 20% and raised the price from $19 to $30
to steer users toward Pro. Another company reduced its plans from five
to two by moving most users to pay-as-you-go, which removed usage caps
and lowered decision friction. Other examples include replacing
generic pricing page banners with value-specific messages, selling
short-term seasonal seats, and increasing usage limits for paid users
as a promotion instead of lowering prices. 

 LEMME MARKETING STRATEGY: HOW THE BRAND SCALED FROM DTC BUZZ TO MASS
RETAIL (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lemme scaled by turning trust into a system and sequencing channels
with intent. It led with benefit-first products designed to be
understood in seconds, then used creator gifting as a repeatable UGC
engine that educated buyers through routines rather than hype. DTC
served as the story and testing ground, Target functioned as
validation, and Walmart delivered scale. Packaging, PDPs, and
messaging were kept consistent across social, site, and shelf. Retail
expansion doubled as a credibility signal, while compliance guardrails
ensured claims and creator content stayed controlled.

 MARKETING EFFICIENCY RATIO: HOW TO CALCULATE AND IMPROVE YOURS (12
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The marketing efficiency ratio (MER) shows how much total revenue
marketing generates for each $1 spent and gives a top-level view of
overall performance across all channels. It is calculated as total
revenue divided by total marketing spend. A sample result of 5.0 means
$5 in revenue for every $1 spent. The metric cuts through attribution
noise, but it does not show which campaigns perform best. A good
result depends on margins and business model rather than a universal
benchmark. The ratio works best when tracked consistently over time
and paired with metrics like ROAS and LTV to explain changes.

 EVALUATING AI PERSONALIZATION ENGINES: AVOIDING OVER-MESSAGING AND
ENDLESS REPETITION (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI personalization often breaks down when systems over-optimize for
engagement and flood customers with repetitive messages. The core
issue is not the technology but incentive structures and algorithms
that ignore intent. The most effective systems are defined by
transparency and the ability to decide when not to send a message at
all. 

 ‘SOCIAL LISTENING': UNILEVER SEEKS TO CAPITALISE ON VASELINE'S
TIKTOK MOMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Vaseline has gone viral on TikTok. Users are showcasing creative
hacks involving the product, from fixing squeaky doors to enhancing
perfume longevity. Unilever, recognizing the momentum, validated
several of these claims through its scientists and amplified them
using content creators rather than traditional ads.
