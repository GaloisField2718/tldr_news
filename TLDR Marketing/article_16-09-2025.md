NEWS & TRENDS

 KEY TAKEAWAYS: HOW PEOPLE ARE USING CHATGPT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ChatGPT adoption is broadening globally and creating value in both
work and personal life. Gender gaps have narrowed, with women now
making up more than half of identified users. Growth is fastest in low
and middle-income countries. Most use centers on everyday tasks like
seeking information, writing, and planning, while coding and
self-expression remain smaller segments. About half of interactions
are advisory “Asking”, 40% are task-oriented “Doing”, and 11%
are reflective “Expressing”. Roughly 30% of usage is work-related
and 70% non-work. 

 ADVERTISING IN 2030 (23 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Confidence in gen AI as a creative tool is rising, while VR, AR, and
the metaverse have failed to gain widespread adoption. Consumer
priorities have shifted back toward price over sustainability.
Workplace communication remains more digital than pre-2020, but many
companies have returned to in-person interactions. Advances in AI,
biometrics, personalization, and bot-to-bot marketing are expected to
continue, while global coordination on privacy and lasting changes in
consumer behavior are seen as unlikely.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FROM MINIMAL TO WHIMSICAL: HOW WE REDESIGNED USERLIST IN 2025 (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Userlist launched a major redesign in September after outgrowing its
minimalist interface from 2019. The update introduced vertical
navigation, denser layouts, smaller fonts, and improved access to
assets like segments and profiles. The team added whimsical
illustrations, a new logo with intertwined U letters, and consistent
microcopy and capitalization rules. The redesign also included a full
refresh of documentation and the marketing website, with new modules,
screenshots, and layouts. 

 REDDIT LEARNINGS FROM 3 MONTHS OF TESTING (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 After 3 months on Reddit, lemlist gained 22% more traffic and 20%
higher conversions but lost posts to deletions and account flags. Each
subreddit has its own rules, moderators cut anything that feels
promotional, and automation backfires. The only way to win is with
authentic, native participation. Reddit doesn't drive quick leads, but
strong threads do boost SEO and AI visibility.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 SEO + PAID TIP: USE VECTOR EMBEDDINGS TO REDUCE WASTE AND CLOSE TOPIC
GAPS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Holistic strategies that unify Paid and Organic data expose where
you're overspending or under-investing across the funnel. Export your
search terms from Google Ads and Search Console, embed both sets of
keywords using a text-embedding model, calculate vector distances
between each Paid keyword and its nearest Organic neighbor, then
identify gaps. 

 THE 6 FRAMEWORKS YOU NEED FOR 2026 PLANNING (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GTM OS delivers a structured approach by guiding leadership teams
through the 5 Valleys, 3 Ps, 15 GTM Problems, and 8 Core Questions
every quarter. This process uncovers where growth is breaking down,
validates whether platform and product-market fits still hold, and
isolates the top 3 or 4 priorities for the next 90 days. By anchoring
planning conversations in these frameworks, leaders replace ad hoc,
reactive decisions with an actionable roadmap.

 AI PROMPT ENGINEERING TO WORK SMARTER, NOT HARDER (5 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Meta prompting helps you reverse-engineer effective prompts to save
time, while basic prompting rules, such as assigning roles and giving
clear instructions, improve output quality. Teaching AI a specific
voice and tone allows for more authentic communication, and asking it
to slow down produces more accurate and thoughtful responses. Other
methods include the AI sandwich, where humans draft, AI expands, and
humans edit, and fill-in-the-blank prompting to complete unfinished
writing. 

 FROM GHIBLI TO NANO BANANA: HOW AI TOOLS BECOME CULTURAL PHENOMENA (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Nano Banana went viral after its August launch, gaining 10M users and
powering 200M image edits within weeks. It runs 2-3X faster than
GPT-4o. Growth came from frictionless onboarding, share-optimized
outputs, and cultural timing. The trend highlights how consumer AI
adoption pushes enterprise uptake and raises expectations for speed,
simplicity, and virality in product design.
