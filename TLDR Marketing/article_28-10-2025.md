NEWS & TRENDS

 THIRD-PARTY SOURCES DRIVE 85% OF BRAND DISCOVERY (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI search mentions come mostly from third-party sources, accounting
for 85% of all brand mentions. Only 13% originate from brand-owned
domains. Brands are 6.5X more likely to be cited externally than on
their own sites. Nearly 90% of these mentions appear in listicles,
comparisons, or reviews. Visibility varies across AI platforms, with
68% of brands appearing on only one system. Owned content builds
credibility, while third-party validation boosts recognition and
discoverability in AI search. 

 SECURE PREPAID TAGS COULD BOOST RETAILERS' CONFIDENCE IN GIFT CARDS
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Infineon and Karta Gift Card have launched NFC-enabled prepaid tags
with cryptographic protection. These tags eliminate printed barcodes
and visible codes, replacing them with encrypted chips for
tap-to-activate or redeem functionality. For brands that offer gift
cards, this offers not just fraud mitigation but also a gateway to
smarter CRM integration and post-purchase engagement.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RETAIN YOUR CUSTOMER THE EASIER WAY USING AI (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Brands using AI-driven retention models can reduce churn by 50-70%
and increase customer lifetime value by up to 200%. AI can identify
churn risk up to 60 days in advance and trigger targeted interventions
by analyzing behavior data such as drops in feature usage or login
frequency. Personalized retention strategies address specific causes
like poor onboarding or price sensitivity, while lifetime value
systems deepen engagement and loyalty. The guide includes a 3-step
playbook with sample prompts. 

 SHOULD YOU REMOVE EXCLUSION LISTS? (REAL TEST RESULTS) (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Removing exclusion lists from Google Ads campaigns led to worse
performance in a 2.5-month test. It showed lower conversions, higher
CPAs, and reduced efficiency. The experiment found that 3 of 4
campaigns performed worse after all exclusions were removed. The
results show that well-applied exclusions still help Smart Bidding by
focusing on high-intent traffic. However, outdated or overly
aggressive exclusions can hurt performance, so advertisers should
reassess older lists and test before making changes. 

 HOW CONTEXTUAL MESSAGING INCREASED PAID SUBSCRIBERS BY 9% (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Adding contextual overlays to explain premium features increased
Mobbin's paid subscribers by 9%. The new design used progressive
disclosure, showing an overlay with visuals, feature descriptions, and
an upgrade button when users hovered over “Pro” labels. This
approach lets users understand the value of premium content without
leaving their current task. During the test, 21% of visitors
interacted with the overlay, showing strong interest in learning about
Pro features at key moments.

 TRUMP AND XI WILL ‘CONSUMMATE' TIKTOK DEAL ON THURSDAY (2 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 TikTok's US operations are moving to a new structure, with a board of
American investors and Oracle managing platform security. The deal,
set to be signed Thursday by Trump and Xi, also ends a series of
extensions to force TikTok's sale. With control now based in the US,
platform policies, ad systems, and data use may shift quickly. 

 WHY IS IT SO HARD TO SHOW MARTECH'S PAYBACK? (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Measuring martech ROI is challenging because organizations treat it
as a one-time expense instead of a long-term capability. Tools often
end up automating old processes rather than driving growth. To realize
martech's potential, treat it as an evolving capability, link it to
business outcomes like retention or revenue, and simplify the stack by
consolidating overlapping systems. 

 CRISIS OR COMEDY: WHEN SHOULD BRANDS LAUGH IT OFF? (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Brands need to know when to use humor and when to stay serious. Humor
can turn a scandal into an advantage, as shown by Astronomer's ad with
Gwyneth Paltrow and Jet2's embrace of TikTok memes. However, it can
also fail, like e.l.f.'s campaign with Matt Rife, which clashed with
audience values. The key is to match tone with brand identity, respond
quickly, and read the room. Well-timed humor can defuse tension, but
misjudged jokes damage trust. The best responses show awareness, not
spin.
