STRATEGIES & TACTICS

[6] 

 Mint Mobile drives over 100,000 monthly website visits from Reddit,
with more than 44% of its social media referrals coming from the
platform. Its semi-official subreddit combines volunteer moderators
and employee accounts to deliver cost-effective support, connect with

centralizing technical help, empowering leadership to engage directly,
and creating a referral sub for SEO and churn control, Mint turned
Reddit into a high-impact growth and retention channel. 

 THE HOW CHAIN: A SIMPLE QUESTIONING METHOD TO REVEAL YOUR BRAND'S
ONLYNESS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To find what truly sets a brand apart, asking “how” repeatedly
uncovers deeper, more specific differentiators than generic claims
like “high-quality service.” Most brands settle for surface-level
answers that competitors can also use. Digging deeper can reveal
unique methods, tools, or processes that others lack. If no clear
differentiator emerges, it may be necessary to create one by analyzing
customers, the company, and the competition. 

 MARKETING ECOSYSTEM OF EXPERT FREELANCERS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The future of marketing is shifting toward lean, flexible systems
built around expert freelancers and specialized agencies, rather than
large in-house teams. Leaders are acting as architects, curating
high-skill partners who not only execute but shape strategy. This
model enables faster momentum, deeper expertise, and stronger
collaboration, with a premium placed on proactive communication and
tailored offers. Marketing is evolving into a networked ecosystem, not
just a department.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 GIRLS IN MARKETING: DIGITAL MARKETING GROWTH PROGRAMME (COURSE) [9] 

 A free, virtual 2-week course designed for junior to mid-level
professionals looking to sharpen their skills and connect with a
supportive community. Held on Wednesday and Friday afternoons, the

 CHATGPT PROJECTS VS GPTS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Use GPTs when you need to share tools with others, integrate external
services like Zapier, or generate simple, repeatable outputs. Choose
Projects for solo use cases that require more flexibility, ongoing
access to the same files or instructions, organized output storage,
and the ability to switch models within one workspace. GPTs are best
for collaboration and automation, while Projects are ideal for
personalized, context-rich workflows.

 DATA-DRIVEN MARKETING STARTS WITH EMAIL AS THE PERSISTENT ANCHOR OF
DIGITAL IDENTITY (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Email remains the backbone of customer identity in an increasingly
fragmented and privacy-conscious environment. It ties together user
interactions across apps, platforms, and devices, making it essential
for delivering personalized marketing with precision. Marketers can
build campaigns that are not only more engaging, but way more
cost-effective by treating email data as a valuable asset and aligning
with privacy regulations. 

 FROM 3RD GRADE TEACHER TO $700M SUNCARE EMPIRE: HOW HOLLY THAGGARD
BUILT SUPERGOOP (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Supergoop grew into a $700M brand by rethinking sunscreen as a user
experience problem, not just a seasonal product. Founder Holly
Thaggard focused on non-greasy formulas, alternative formats like
sprays and sticks, and skincare-enhanced benefits to solve key
consumer pain points. Instead of relying on paid media, she built
community-led education and rejected seasonal retail placement,
securing year-round distribution and redefining the category. 

 MARKETING'S AI FRONTIER: WHAT 50 TECH CMOS REVEALED (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 AI is reshaping marketing at every level, from content creation and
lead generation to sales strategy and outreach, often enabling smaller
companies to move faster than large enterprises. Many CMOs report
rapid experimentation with AI tools, with some building customized
solutions in days and others facing challenges from tool switching and
integration issues. On-premise AI deployments are making a comeback
due to heightened security concerns, especially in regulated
industries. AI is also starting to replace some human roles, with some
companies cutting staff in areas like design and sales development.
CMOs are advised to focus on high-impact tasks, build cross-functional
AI teams, and continuously learn to keep pace with the rapidly
evolving landscape.
