 HOW REVOLUT GREW 150X WITH REFERRAL MARKETING (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Revolut‚Äôs marketing strategy is centered around making its fintech
product so good that customers will do the marketing for it via
word-of-mouth. Rather than having an always-on referral program, the
brand runs various campaigns designed to bring in new users.
Time-boxing the campaigns creates an extra push for users to invite
others, in addition to offering a monetary incentive for the referrer.
Revolut has also run campaigns that reward a physical card to the
invitee, while the inviter interestingly receives nothing. It uses
clever copy that makes users feel positive about themselves.
