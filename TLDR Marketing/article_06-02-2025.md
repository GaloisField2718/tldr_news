NEWS & TRENDS

 2025: PREDICTIONS VERSUS REALITY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Many predictions for 2025 missed the mark. Virtual reality was
expected to replace smartphones, but only 5% globally own a headset
due to cost and comfort barriers. Ebooks were predicted to replace
print, yet 51% still prefer physical books for their practicality.
While remote work forecasts were accurate, few foresaw a pandemic as
the catalyst. These failures show that change happens slower than
expected, societal habits shape adoption more than technology alone,
and everyday behaviors - not expert predictions - ultimately determine
which innovations succeed. 

 CARL'S JR. RETURNS TO RACY ADVERTISING YEARS AFTER IT ABANDONED
‘BIKINIS AND BURGERS' (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Carl's Jr. has returned to sexualized marketing with an ad featuring
influencer Alix Earle, years after abandoning the strategy. The ad
plays on nostalgia while targeting Gen Z consumers with humor and
social media appeal. Experts link this shift to changing cultural
norms under the new presidential administration. The campaign focuses
on digital engagement, using Earle's 7.2 million TikTok followers and
selective TV placements instead of a costly Super Bowl ad buy.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE TRIAL-TO-PAID PARADOX (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trial start rates follow an inverse relationship with trial-to-paid
conversion, so Meta Ads' focus on trial efficiency often leads to
campaigns favoring younger, lower-spending audiences. While
18-24-year-olds start trials at nearly double the rate of 55+ users,
they convert to paid plans at less than a third of the rate. To
maximize revenue, advertisers should shift strategy toward older users
by leveraging static ads, clearer messaging, and higher-value pricing.


 THE KEY TO SUSTAINING AN ENDURING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE (10 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Only 1 in 10 companies are able to achieve sustained profitable
growth over a decade. Rising complexity is cited as the biggest
barrier. Research into long-term competitive advantage reveals three
strategic principles: clear differentiation, embedding core strategic
principles throughout the organization, and strong learning systems.
This podcast explores some case studies, including Nike, IKEA, and
Enterprise Rent-A-Car to show how repeatable models can drive
long-term success while reducing complexity.

 EVOLUTIONIQ JUST GOT ACQUIRED FOR $730M — HERE'S THEIR PLAYBOOK FOR
BUILDING AN ENDURING AI BUSINESS (36 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 EvolutionIQ succeeded in the crowded AI space by focusing on a niche
market (bodily injury claims) and building deep relationships in an
industry with only 150 key decision-makers. It secured a $730M
acquisition by CCC Intelligent Solutions after creating the "claims
guidance" category with nine products, international expansion, and a
sustainable business model. The company prioritized premium pricing,
ROI-driven sales, and high-touch customer service, ensuring long-term
success without relying on technical novelty. EvolutionIQ won deals by
targeting decision-makers with profit responsibility, leveraging
word-of-mouth introductions, and hiring industry insiders instead of
traditional sales reps. Its strategy of turning early customers into
advocates and focusing on measurable outcomes enabled it to dominate
its market. 

 WHY WINNING NEW CUSTOMERS IS HARDER THAN EVER (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Sales cycles are longer, website traffic is declining, and
competition is more intense - all of these factors are making it
harder to acquire new customers. Buyers now complete 80% of their
research before contacting a company, demanding transparency,
self-service tools, and trust-building content. In this context,
companies that openly address pricing, customer concerns, and industry
comparisons while making their sales process more accessible are able
to close more deals.
