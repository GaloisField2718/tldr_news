 6 REASONS WHY RISE‚ÄôS USER ONBOARDING IS GREAT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Rise is a sleep tracker app that stands out in a crowded market
because of its new user onboarding. The creators talked to users to
guide its onboarding, rather than just throwing ideas at the wall to
see what worked. The app's onboarding flow uses storytelling to keep
users engaged and prevent exits. The experience is personalized and
explains important access requests along the way. It also provides
value during onboarding by educating users on their sleep needs and
energy peaks and surfaces key selling points right before presenting
pricing for the subscription. 

 HOW TO WRITE COPY FOR THE 4 STAGES OF THE POST-PURCHASE CUSTOMER
LIFECYCLE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This guide walks through how to write copy for the 4 post-purchase
stages: onboarding, retention, upsell/cross-sell, and winback.
Onboarding copy should offer clear instructions, highlight key
benefits, and show how your product fits into users' routines.
Retention copy should include regular communication to keep your brand
top of mind, encourage customers to share input, and reward loyalty.
The upsell/cross-sell stage should focus on increasing customers'
lifetime value with personalization. Winback copywriting must first
acknowledge the lapse before highlighting new offerings and providing
an incentive to return.

 WHY OUR MOOD HEAVILY INFLUENCES OUR PURCHASE DECISIONS (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 If you‚Äôre struggling to move people to buy, analyze your ads to
ensure you‚Äôre optimizing for the right mood. One study suggests that
even browsing potential purchases (and not buying) alleviates feelings
of sadness. To apply this to marketing, ensure your imagery mirrors
the intended mood ‚Äì as Calm does with peaceful, relaxing imagery in
its meditation app ads. Make the ordinary feel extraordinary, which
IKEA does with a clever crib ad. Work backward from the emotion you
want people to feel to determine what mood your ads should invoke. 

 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PRODUCT, FEATURE, SOLUTION, AND
PLATFORM? (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Understanding the nuances between a product, feature, solution, and
platform is vital, especially since they are often conflated. Features
represent a singular capability, products integrate features to
address broader needs, solutions package products/services for
specific user groups, and platforms provide the technological
infrastructure for development. For product marketers, recognizing
these differences is key to crafting targeted launch strategies and
messaging aligned with various audience needs.
