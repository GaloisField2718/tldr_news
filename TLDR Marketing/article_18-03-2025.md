NEWS & TRENDS

 TARIFFS TRIGGER ‘HORRIFIC' PLUNGE IN CONSUMER SENTIMENT (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Concerns over tariffs and economic uncertainty have weakened outlooks
on personal finances, labor markets, and business conditions. The
Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady while
monitoring inflation expectations. Analysts warn that declining
sentiment could slow consumer spending, with rising savings rates and
cautious retailer forecasts signaling a potential downturn. 

 SOBERING REVENUE STATS OF 70K MOBILE APPS SHOW WHY DEVS BEG FOR
SUBSCRIPTIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most mobile apps struggle to generate revenue, with fewer than 20%
making $1K per month within two years. The top 5% of apps now earn
500X more than the rest, widening the revenue gap. Developers
increasingly push subscriptions, as most trial sign-ups happen on the
first day, and retention rates are low. Apps are expected to introduce
more paywalls, upsells, and alternative pricing models to stay afloat.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GUIDE TO SIGNAL-BASED CAMPAIGNS (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Signal-based campaigns rely on behavioral and data-driven intent
signals to determine when a potential buyer is ready to engage.
Setting them up involves structuring a CRM with tiered accounts and
enriched contact data, defining account engagement stages to track
progress, setting clear rules for sales and marketing handoffs, and
implementing workflows to act on signals efficiently. These campaigns
improve conversion rates by reaching the right people at the right
time, but they require careful execution. 

 FIVE PLG TACTICS EVERY SALES-LED COMPANY SHOULD DO (6 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Interactive demos help sales teams qualify leads faster, with
companies like Amplitude attributing 30% of their pipeline to them.
Time-based trials create urgency, accelerate deal cycles, and increase
conversions by letting prospects experience the product firsthand.
Self-serve activation reduces churn and improves retention by ensuring
new users engage with the product without relying on high-touch
onboarding. Tracking product signals enables proactive expansion
efforts, improving Net Dollar Retention by identifying upgrade
opportunities early. UGC builds trust and drives growth for companies
like Salesforce and ServiceNow, which leverage customer contributions
to enhance engagement.

 HOW MORE TOOLS AND TACTICS HURT MARKETING PERFORMANCE (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Marketing teams often overload their tech stacks, leading to wasted
effort. Mid-market companies use an average of 255 apps, many for
marketing. To stay effective, companies should focus on high-impact
tools, prioritize valuable channels, and streamline processes.
Automation adds complexity if it doesn't truly reduce effort. 

 HOW AND WHEN "WORK–LIFE" MESSAGING IN MARKETING CAN BACKFIRE (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Work-life messaging increases engagement for simple products like
personal care and planners, but backfires for resource-heavy ones like
education and travel. Research shows consumers often perceive these
messages as reminders of conflicting demands, reducing interest in
complex purchases. The findings challenge the common assumption that
positioning a product for both work and personal life is always
effective. 

 WILL PEOPLE BUY CARS ON TIKTOK? (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 TikTok is expanding into automotive advertising with two new ad
formats. Inventory ads target buyers ready to purchase, while model
ads focus on those still considering options. With 37% of adult users
shopping for cars and 56% watching reviews, TikTok aims to move
consumers from discovery to action. Early results show increased
engagement and lower acquisition costs, with Peugeot (a French car
brand) reporting a 95% improvement in cost-per-engage session, a 40%
decrease in CPA, a 78% increase in CTR, and a 40% boost in engagement.
