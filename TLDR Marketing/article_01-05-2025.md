NEWS & TRENDS

 ADVERTISERS FINALLY WIN KEY TRANSPARENCY CONCESSIONS FROM GOOGLE'S
PERFORMANCE MAX (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Following years of criticism about PMax's black-box nature, Google
announced new reporting features, including visibility into spend,
impressions, and conversions by channel. Advertisers will also see
which video assets and product listings were used and which search
terms triggered ads. 

 VISA AND MASTERCARD UNVEIL AI-POWERED SHOPPING (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Visa has launched Intelligent Commerce and Mastercard has introduced
Agent Pay, both enabling agentic AI to shop for users. The tools use
consumer inputs to personalize recommendations, make purchases, and
suggest payment methods. They join a broader trend of agentic commerce
led by companies like PayPal, Amazon, and OpenAI.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GROWING A PASSION PROJECT TO $300K ARR WITH A $0 CAC (9 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 More than 50 percent of Old Girls Club members chose to pay a $10
monthly fee when pricing was introduced to what began as a free Slack
community. The high conversion rate reflected a high-trust,
high-engagement environment where members saw tangible value in peer
connection and participation. Instead of using growth hacks or email
campaigns, the founder created momentum by spotlighting power users,
giving members product influence, and creating rituals that encouraged
people to invite others. 

 THE 6 INGREDIENTS OF UNIQUE CONTENT (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most creators rely on platform, copywriting, and design to compete,
but these alone rarely make content stand out. Unique content
consistently uses six ingredients: understanding your audience through
direct research, developing original concepts and points of view,
writing with clarity and precision, designing in a way that supports
the idea, distributing content where your audience already spends
time, and improving based on performance data rather than trends.

 AD CURATION: WHAT MARKETERS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS HOT ADVERTISING
TOPIC (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ad curation packages ad inventory using contextual and data signals
to improve targeting, efficiency, and brand safety, shifting control
from open exchanges to curated environments. Over 80% of nonsocial
programmatic display spend now flows through private marketplaces or
direct deals. Its benefits include better performance, simplified
buying, and privacy-safe data use, but its challenges include
increased complexity, higher costs, and potential targeting
limitations. Key players include publishers, SSPs, agencies,
advertisers, and data providers, with AI and standardization driving
further adoption across channels like CTV, mobile apps, and digital
out-of-home.

 HOW AI AND ALGORITHMS QUIETLY SHAPE YOUR BRAND'S IDENTITY (8 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Brand visibility today is largely determined by how content performs
on algorithm-driven platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
Short-form, trend-based content tends to dominate because it aligns
with what algorithms reward, often pushing brands to prioritize
metrics over the message. However, the strongest performers rebalance
this distribution power with emotionally resonant storytelling that
builds long-term brand equity and promotes customer loyalty. 

 THE NFT MARKET FELL APART. BRANDS ARE STILL PAYING THE PRICE (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Once hailed as a marketing breakthrough, NFTs have become a liability
for brands like Nike, DraftKings, and Dapper Labs. Once-promising web3
ventures are being shut down, and buyers are suing over lost value,
unfulfilled perks, and alleged securities violations. Studies suggest
NFTs may even hurt brand perception, especially for luxury goods. As
NFT valuations continue to crash, companies are left dealing with
legal fallout and little return on their blockchain bets.
