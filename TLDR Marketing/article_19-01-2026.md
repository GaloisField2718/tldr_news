 THREADS EDGES OUT X IN DAILY MOBILE USERS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta's Threads now has more daily mobile users than X. Growth is
steady and not linked to recent X controversies. Threads benefits from
cross-promotion in Meta apps, a focus on creators, and new features
like communities, disappearing posts, and games. X still leads on the
web and in the US, but Threads is building a regular mobile audience. 

 GOAT'S 2026 PREDICTIONS FOR ONLINE CULTURE, CONTENT, AND CREATORS (25
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Creator marketing is now mainstream media. Attention is harder to win
as feeds become endless video streams and audiences fragment. Creator
revenue is expected to grow 20% and reach $376B globally by 2030. 2026
will see more intentional consumption and a split between AI-safe and
AI-friendly spaces. Demand will increase for credible creators,
episodic storytelling, and community-led strategies that connect
online culture with real-world experiences.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DIARY OF A BRAND: GENTLE MONSTER (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Gentle Monster shows that strong brand memory can drive growth
without heavy ad spend. Last year, it grew 30% and nearly doubled
Luxottica's operating margin using a high-margin direct-to-consumer
model focused on memorable experiences. Oversized products,
museum-like stores, and unexpected collaborations keep it top of mind.
Owned factories and long-term leadership enable $200-$400 price points
and expansion into new categories. 

 GROWTH OVER GOING VIRAL (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 BÉIS focuses on growth over chasing virality. Partnerships and
collaborations with Gap, Chipotle, and Rare Beauty drive engagement,
while behind-the-scenes content, especially shot organically, often
outperforms polished final posts. Short-form videos can reach
millions, but long-form, informative content builds deeper engagement
and conversion. The team experiments constantly and often shares
stories of the people behind the brand.

 OPENAI: OUR APPROACH TO ADVERTISING AND EXPANDING ACCESS TO CHATGPT
(3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ChatGPT is expanding access with low-cost subscriptions and limited
ads while keeping answers independent and user data private. ChatGPT
Go launched in 171 countries and will cost $8/month in the US,
offering higher limits, image creation, and memory. Ads will appear
for logged-in adults on free and Go tiers. Pro, Business, and
Enterprise plans remain ad-free.

 GROWTH IS NOW A TRUST PROBLEM (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Growth today depends on credibility and customer confidence.
Traditional marketing channels are failing as paid search costs rise
and AI intercepts organic traffic. Efficiency-based value props are
easily outpaced by $20/month AI tools. Employee-led sharing,
influencer partnerships, and community-driven growth drive
word-of-mouth, which can boost referral revenue. 

 A NEW STUDY RAISES RISKS OF USING AGREEABLE CHATBOTS (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Agreeable chatbots can reinforce beliefs and increase polarization. A
study of over 3,000 US participants across four political topics found
sycophantic AI heightened extremity and overconfidence compared to
neutral or disagreeable AI. Participants saw agreeable chatbots as
warmer, more competent, and often unbiased, even when they were not.
The research warns that commercial incentives could push AI toward
agreeableness, limiting exposure to opposing views as these tools
become more common.
