 INSTAGRAM CHIEF REITERATES THAT SENDS ARE NOW A KEY FOCUS (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Instagram now prioritizes content that encourages users to share
posts via DMs. It has rolled out send count displays to more users to
support this. The shift is due to increased user engagement within DMs
rather than feed posts. Content creators should focus on making
share-worthy content that evokes emotions like inspiration and
admiration. Positive, interesting, and humorous content tends to drive
more shares.

preventing pMax campaigns from eating up the branded traffic.
