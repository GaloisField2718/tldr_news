 THE PINTEREST FALL 2024 TREND REPORT (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 This report unveils trends in fashion, beauty, home decor, food, and
hobbies for the upcoming fall season. Nature-inspired patterns and
mixed-proportion layering take center stage in the fashion space. The
latest beauty trends feature a blend of bold and contemporary styles,
with ‚Äòmore-is-more' makeup making a comeback. Foodie interest in
earthy ingredients, like morel mushrooms and pistachio butter, and
Japanese cuisine is on the rise. Gen Z is combatting the autumn blues
by focusing on unique hobbies and IRL connections. 

 SHOPPING HAULS ARE SO BACK (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Shopping hauls are resurging, driven by algorithmic recommendations
and Buy Now, Pay Later programs. YouTube and TikTok enabling direct
purchases from videos further fuels this trend. This ease of shopping
has led to a 12-month high in average items per transaction, with
nearly 11 products per order, exceeding last December's holiday sales.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 INFLUENCER NICHES AND WHY YOU NEED TO BLUR THEM (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A ‚Äúvertical‚Äù in the influencer world refers to a niche or
category that a creator specializes in, with brands traditionally
sticking to these lanes. To maintain engagement, brands should blur
the lines between their products and creators. Understand your
audience, including their preferred content, creators, and
communities. Take calculated risks by choosing influencers outside
your niche, but avoid those who don't align with your brand values or
genuinely like your product. Consider adjacent conversations relevant
to your audience, even if they don't directly tie to your product, as
seen with Fidelity Investments partnering with a cooking creator. 

 HOW TO USE UNORDINARY OBJECTS TO WIN ON SOCIAL (1 MINUTE VIDEO) [8] 

 A breakdown of how brands like Jacquemus, Aritzia, and Mush use
objects and visuals to break the norms seen on social media. Jacquemus
plays around with attention-grabbing images, videos, and lettering in
its IG carousels. Aritzia promoted its sale with a video of a girl
shopping with a life-size shopping bag as big as her. 

 HOW TO CAPTURE FOOTAGE FOR SHORT-FORM VIDEOS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To organize footage for short-form videos, create a dedicated folder
on your phone to keep footage organized. Mark potential hook shots for
engaging intros and aim to capture a high volume of clips, around 50
per location (if you're visiting multiple places), using a "wide,
medium, close" shot format. Focus on quick 1-second clips to maintain
viewer interest and avoid excessive cropping. Include a variety of
shots, both of the surroundings and yourself, using a Bluetooth tripod
or a friend for dynamic footage. Prioritize establishing, normal, and
close-up shots to ensure a well-rounded video.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 USE CHROME TO EMULATE SEARCHES FROM ANY LOCATION (1 MINUTE READ) [10]


 You can use the "Sensors" functionality of Chrome DevTools to analyze
search results from another city or country. Search for the query,
right-click and choose "Inspect" to open up Chrome DevTools, navigate
to Sensors, then set the location. Click "Update location" at the
bottom of the SERP to see the updated version of the results. 

 GENERATE HIGH-QUALITY EMAIL COPY WITH CHATGPT (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 First, create a custom email GPT for your brand that covers copy
length, brand style and voice, and repetitive words to avoid. Next,
use modularized prompts that force ChatGPT to return the copy in
preset email sections. Reprompt the output to improve the copy quickly
by asking the tool to rate the existing copy and rewrite it. This post
includes example prompts to use at each step.

 WHAT IS A SLUG? URL SLUGS AND WHY THEY MATTER FOR SEO (6 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Although Google acknowledges that URL slugs contribute minimally to
SEO rankings, they play a crucial role in user experience, which is
closely tied to SEO. A clear and concise URL slug, ideally containing
the target keyword, helps both users and search engines understand the
page content. Best practices suggest keeping slugs short, descriptive,
and free of special characters. 

 COMPETING IN SEARCH (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The recent ruling against Google for abusing its search monopoly
shows the complex dynamics of search engine dominance. Google is
fueled by a self-reinforcing cycle where its popularity improves
results and attracts more users and revenue. This dominance is
maintained by high traffic acquisition costs, which solidify Google's
lead and create barriers for competitors like Bing. Although the
ruling may prompt changes, it remains unclear how effective the
remedies will be and how LLMs might reshape the search landscape.
