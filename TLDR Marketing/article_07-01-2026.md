NEWS & TRENDS

 EXPERTS PREDICT THE TOP SOCIAL MARKETING TRENDS OF 2026 (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Audiences are tired of automated content and want originality. AI is
expected to support teams behind the scenes rather than drive visible
output. Distinct brand voices are replacing performative chaos with
more focus on episodic formats and platform-native ideas. Social is
increasingly linked to IRL experiences, and creator partnerships are
becoming deeper, longer-term, and more human. 

 REPORTS SUGGEST THAT OPENAI MAY BE LOOKING TO ACQUIRE PINTEREST (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is rumored to be pursuing Pinterest to access richer human
behavior data, especially around product search trends. The move would
give it a stronger foundation for AI-powered shopping experiences and
better monetization through ad placements. Pinterest brings over 600
million users and a robust search engine optimized for visual
discovery, which could become a core part of OpenAI's data
infrastructure. This signals a shift toward direct data ownership
rather than relying on costly licensing deals.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO BE SEEN AND GROW ON SOCIAL (3 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Social growth now comes from doing less, not more. This guide
includes a cheat sheet breaking down how algorithms work. Content must
serve both new audiences discovering you and existing followers
returning to your feed. Be findable through clear topics and keywords,
and build recognizable formats that people remember. Treat every post
as a value exchange. 

 SEO & AI TIP: USE GOOGLE'S ANTIGRAVITY TO ACT AS YOUR GOOGLE QUALITY
RATERS GUIDELINES AGENT (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Build an AI agent in Gemini by using a markdown copy of the Google
Quality Rater Guidelines as the agent's core knowledge source. Convert
that document into a strict auditing checklist, then have it review a
target keyword SERP and a landing page in Chrome against the
checklist. Generate a scored markdown report that maps performance to
“Needs Met” and E-E-A-T criteria. Run the same process on the
top-ranking page and compare gaps in authorship signals, content
depth, and navigation quality.

 STATE OF AI SEARCH OPTIMIZATION 2026 (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI search optimization now depends on entering retrieval windows,
earning citations, and building user trust as search shifts to single
definitive answers. ChatGPT sends at most 4% of current organic
referral traffic, yet AI answers increasingly replace result lists,
making visibility critical even without clear value attribution. Fast
servers under 200ms matter because sites under 1s load get 3x more
Googlebot requests, and LLM retrieval windows are even tighter.
Citation rates remain low since 24% of ChatGPT responses fetch no
online content, and Gemini omits clickable citations in 92% of
answers. Trust and selection improve through structured content,
updates within 3 months, strong third-party mentions, and top-10
Google rankings. 

 COOKING WITH CONSTRAINTS: A DESIGNER'S FRAMEWORK FOR BETTER AI
PROMPTS (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article compares prompt prep to mise en place, showing how
structured inputs reduce confusion and lead to better creative
results. The TC EBC method provides a clear prompt format that can be
used to guide models in Figma Make toward more polished app mockups.
Clarity also helps teams move faster and iterate with intention.
Different models respond to different kinds of input. Claude works
well with layered instructions, Gemini shines in short,
constraint-heavy tasks, and GPT thrives when guided by examples.
Feeding models extra context, such as design frames or product docs,
improves results further.
