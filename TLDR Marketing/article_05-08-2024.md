NEWS & TRENDS

 RETAILERS STRUGGLE TO IDENTIFY SITE VISITORS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Almost 85% of ecommerce site visitors remain unidentified, which
hinders retailers' ability to engage them effectively. Identifying
visitors is key, as businesses with the highest identification rates
experience 53% higher repeat purchases. The lack of information
prevents retailers from personalizing their communication and
retargeting customers which is critical to compete with discount
marketplaces like Amazon. 

 THE POWER OF AUTHENTICITY: 100 BRANDS WINNING BIG WITH TIKTOK
CREATORS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Brands with higher creator retention rates, where at least 25% of
creators post about the brand in consecutive 12-month periods, perform
better. User engagement on TikTok is high, with users 1.2X more likely
to watch brand content and message brands compared to other platforms.
Authenticity is crucial - 41% of users find creator content authentic
and 55% trust brands more when endorsed by creators. Ads featuring
creators related to a brand's vertical are 1.5X more effective. 

 AMAZON MISSES ON AD SALES WHILE PRIME VIDEO PUSH RAMPS UP (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Amazon advertising services grew 20% YoY in Q2 to $12.77 billion, a
deceleration from prior quarters. Most ad revenue still comes from
sponsored product formats, but the retail media category has become
more competitive and mature. Forecasts suggest retail media's growth
rate could slow next year as budgets are exhausted. Amazon introduced
commercials to Prime Video and in May hosted its first upfront event
pitching for larger TV ad budgets, though these deals can take time to
materialize.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 3 MICRO-LESSONS ON WRITING BETTER COPY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Take a break when stuck to allow for incubation ‚Äî our brain's
ability to subconsciously process information and make connections.
Use contrast and opposing elements in your copy to create intrigue and
make your writing more engaging and memorable. If your copy feels
generic and flat, use the ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù exercise until you arrive at
what the prospect truly desires, consciously or otherwise. 

 SELL MORE WITH FRONT END OFFERS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Decision paralysis leads to inaction or significant delays in making
a choice. It often happens when there are too many choices available.
Instead, provide front end offers ‚Äî they're easy to understand,
low-priced, and deliver quick results. After the initial sale is made,
upsell customers to higher-tier products. This approach focuses on
lifetime customer value, makes the first sale easier, and builds trust
gradually. 

 USE BORING SIGN-UP SCREENS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Insights from recent redesigns at Spotify, Nextdoor, Ring, and
AllTrails indicate that boring, functional sign-up screens drive more
conversions. Removing distracting visuals and focusing on a
streamlined experience can enhance usability and download rates.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 DIRECTIONAL REPORTING IN GA4 (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 GA4 will always experience data loss due to cookies and ad blockers.
It's important to look at the data directionally to get actionable
insights from it. For example, look at the percentage of sessions and
key events per page rather than the raw counts of each metric. Show
year-over-year dashboards with rounded totals and the percentage
change. These types of visualizations can help others understand that
GA4 will never be perfectly accurate but can be useful directionally. 

 AI IN MARKETING - TOP TOOLS FOR AUTOMATION AND ANALYTICS (15 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 AI now handles 60-70% of marketing workflows, enabling smaller teams
to achieve higher productivity. The rise of AI in marketing has also
led to faster product launches, reducing time by 50-60%. Key tools
include MarketMuse for white papers, Grammarly for content refinement,
and Substack and Convertkit for thematic newsletters. Hootsuite,
Taplio, and Buffer manage social media engagement, while Knotch or
Chartbeat track user interactions and sentiment. Lately and Circleboom
facilitate content distribution across platforms and communities.

 YOUR ORDINARY IS YOUR AUDIENCE'S EXTRAORDINARY (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Your brand's everyday activities can be extraordinary to your
audience, much like reality TV shows about niche jobs captivate
viewers. By showcasing behind-the-scenes content, such as Getty
Museum's earthquake-proofing process or Wild Rivers Waterpark's slide
checks, brands can engage their audience with seemingly ordinary
moments. This approach makes your audience feel like insiders,
fostering a deeper connection and appreciation for your work. 

 IS NIKE STILL COOL? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Nike's focus on digital marketing and broad product categories has
diminished its cool factor. In this article, former executive Massimo
Giunco highlights the company's shift from niche collaborations, like
the Flyknit series, to generic offerings, reducing innovation and
cultural impact. Despite being a market leader, Nike has seen many new
competitors stealing market share and is struggling to maintain its
cultural appeal.
