NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW DITCHING PRIDE NOW COULD HURT BRANDS LATER (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Some brands that once actively supported the LGBTQ+ community have
scaled back their Pride efforts due to political pressure. Target,
once a leader in Pride merchandising and sponsorship, has faced
backlash for quietly retreating from its DEI commitments. This has
prompted organizations like Twin Cities Pride to reject its support.
Experts warn that while any brand can return to the space, doing so
after pulling back may come across as inauthentic. 

 WEBSITES WITH MORE ORGANIC SEARCH TRAFFIC GET MENTIONED MORE IN AI
SEARCH (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Websites with higher organic search traffic are more frequently
mentioned in AI search systems. Perplexity showed the strongest
correlation (0.66), followed by Google AI Overviews (0.47), and
ChatGPT (0.33). Perplexity's results closely mirror traditional
search, while ChatGPT's data is heavily skewed by Wikipedia, which
appears in 16.3% of its mentions. Google AI Overviews favor UGC like
YouTube, Reddit, and Quora and under-represent social media platforms.
Corporate and entertainment sites receive less visibility across all
systems compared to their performance in traditional search.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 2 OVERLOOKED REASONS YOUR PMAX CAMPAIGNS FAIL (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Performance Max campaigns often fail due to poor initial product
targeting and a lack of attention to product competitiveness. Many
advertisers target too many products at once instead of focusing on
high-converting items that match budgets and goals. The “Product
Targeting Matrix” can be used to help align product selection with 4
key budget-growth scenarios. Success also depends on optimizing the
shopping experience scorecard, which includes shipping, returns,
browsing, and purchase experience. 

 AN AI VIDEO AD IS MAKING A SPLASH. IS IT THE FUTURE OF ADVERTISING?
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Kalshi, a prediction market platform, released a viral AI-generated
ad during the NBA Finals that cost under $2K and was made in just two
days. Creator P.J. Accetturo used Kalshi's ideas and dialogue to build
a script with ChatGPT, then generated scenes with Google's Veo 3,
refining prompts until he had 15 usable clips from 300-400
generations. He stitched the footage together with editing software
and added music. The ad's bizarre, meme-style tone helped it reach
over 3M views.

 RETAIL MEDIA'S GROWING PAINS: HOW TO PUSH FOR TRANSPARENCY BEFORE THE
BUBBLE BURSTS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Retail media is growing fast but is plagued by poor transparency,
inflated metrics, and uneven data access. ROAS and “new-to-brand”
stats often misrepresent actual impact, with platforms claiming credit
for sales that would have occurred anyway. Brands risk overspending,
especially in off-site campaigns that rely on vague lookalike
audiences and come with steep management fees. Choosing between direct
retailer platforms and agnostic marketplaces depends on scale,
negotiating power, and data needs. 

 WHY DO INVESTORS CARE ABOUT LTV TO CAC SO MUCH? (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Investors focus on the LTV to CAC ratio because it reflects sales and
marketing efficiency, which directly impacts company valuation. A
higher ratio means more profit per customer acquisition dollar,
enabling growth investment and leading to higher valuation multiples.
For example, a 3X LTV to CAC can triple valuation compared to 2X.
Adjusted by gross margin, it fairly compares sectors. Though complex
for daily use, breaking it down internally helps improve value.
