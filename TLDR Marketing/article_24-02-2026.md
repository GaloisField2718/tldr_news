NEWS & TRENDS

 BRANDS SEE BIGGEST GROWTH ON TIKTOK BUT ORGANIC REACH IS SLOWING ON
INSTAGRAM (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TikTok is delivering the strongest audience growth, with median
follower counts rising over 200% year over year and generating high
engagement per post. Instagram continues to post steady follower
gains, but organic reach is declining across all formats, limiting its
growth upside. Facebook remains largely flat in follower growth while
still anchoring overall audience scale. The data suggests TikTok is
emerging as the primary discovery engine, while Instagram and Facebook
function as reach stabilizers rather than accelerators. 

 AI-SEO IS A CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROBLEM (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI SEO efforts fail mainly because of organizational misalignment,
not weak tactics or tools. Readiness and change management drive
success, and fewer than one-third of teams sustain performance
improvements during major shifts. About 70% of AI implementation
hurdles relate to people and process issues, while only about 10% are
purely technical. 84% of marketers say their LLM visibility
measurement is inaccurate. Strong change management can create an 8X
improvement in success, and firms using key transformation factors can
raise success rates from 30-80%. Teams need to treat SEO leaders as
change agents before deploying AI-SEO tactics. 

 CAN THE CREATOR ECONOMY STAY AFLOAT IN A FLOOD OF AI SLOP? (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The creator economy is entering a new phase as leading YouTubers
expand into consumer products and venture-backed businesses. At the
same time, generative video tools are accelerating content production,
increasing the risk of saturation and IP conflicts. AI may make
breakout growth harder for emerging creators. Monetization will depend
less on views alone and more on owned products and direct audience
relationships.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 I GET 3X MORE INBOUND FROM COMMENTS THAN POSTS (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 LinkedIn reach is shrinking, making strategic commenting more
effective than posting for visibility and inbound. Comments over 15
words carry roughly 2X the algorithmic weight. Consistent 15 minute
daily commenting generated 3-4X more inbound conversations in six
months and took 40% less time because comments tap into existing
distribution. The most effective comments add relevant experience or
sharp questions, while AI-sounding replies get suppressed. 

 PUNCH THE MONKEY AND A $0 MARKETING MASTERCLASS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 IKEA's social media manager, Elissa Wardrop, turned a viral baby
monkey story into a marketing win by acting fast. She took a real-time
photo of the IKEA toy Punch used, bypassed approvals, and reinforced
the brand's role by donating first, earning authentic “story
permission” before promotion, and the post drove massive engagement.
Daily updates kept the audience engaged, showing how a single post can
become a series that builds connection and sustained attention.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW MARKETERS ARE USING AI TO MAKE BETTER VIDEOS FASTER, NOT JUST
BOOST VOLUME (SPONSOR) [10] 

 When everyone can churn out videos with AI, volume won't set you
apart. Wistia's new AI Video Marketing Trends [10] report shows how AI
is being used to make better videos faster, rather than just producing
more content. Read the report [10] to see how AI can handle the grunt
work so you can be creative 

 HOW TO WRITE AN UNIGNORABLE EMAIL (WEBINAR) [11] 

 Carly Valancy, founder of Reach Out Party, will share the 3 levers of
her Unignorable Email Framework at this webinar. She'll also talk
about how to feel confident cold emailing the people you don't feel
"ready" to connect with and build a repeatable networking process. The
event will take place on February 25 at 9 AM PT. 

 HOW TO KNOW YOUR CONTENT RENDERS AT SCALE (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Enabling JavaScript crawling in Screaming Frog captures fully
rendered screenshots of every page on a site. This provides a scalable
view of how content displays. Instead of testing pages individually,
Screaming Frog automates the process by configuring the spider to
render JavaScript, enabling page screenshots, running the crawl, and
reviewing each page's rendered view in the HTML report. This approach
helps identify rendering issues across key pages and templates and
highlights where JavaScript or AI tools might struggle to index
content accurately.

 THE CASE FOR HUMANS (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI doesn't care about outcomes. An agent can pass tests and generate
endless code, yet if the product breaks or users leave, the human is
still accountable. Speed creates opportunity, but it is not a moat.
When building becomes cheap, customers stop rewarding effort and start
rewarding what is hard to copy. Infinite output does not create a
durable advantage because real advantage comes from nonobvious bets
and hard tradeoffs. As AI floods the world with personalized content,
shared experiences and community grow more valuable because trust and
belonging cannot be automated. 

 7 SURPRISING FINDINGS FROM OUR STUDY OF 15K+ GOOGLE ADS ACCOUNTS (7
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This study shows widespread inefficiency in paid search, with the
average account wasting more than $1K per month and over a quarter
recording no conversions within a 90-day window. Only 22% of accounts
maintain a Quality Score of 7 or higher, and 36% fall below 4,
highlighting structural weaknesses across industries. Smaller spenders
outperform larger budgets in conversion efficiency, challenging the
assumption that scale drives results. The strongest accounts rely on
tighter segmentation and negative keywords, which correlate with
nearly 3X higher conversion rates.
