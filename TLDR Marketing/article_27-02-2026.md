 INSIDER SESSION: HOW TO CREATE A HOLISTIC BRAND EXPERIENCE (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 "Brand" is a big word, and everyone seems to be talking about it. But
what does it mean in practice? A shinier logo? More display ads?

In this conversation with WiseStamp [4], Island's Head of Brand shares
his approach on how NOT to be generic, and instead, build a brand that
delights.

Learn how to develop your brand story and experience with the small,
intentional details [4] that build trust and make brand moments stick.

NEWS & TRENDS

 CLAUDE CODE AND THE GREAT PRODUCTIVITY PANIC OF 2026 (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 There's a spark of productivity panic in tech, pressuring engineers
and executives to work longer hours and produce more code. Once seen
as a way to “vibe code” casually, these tools now drive an
expectation that everyone experiment with AI while maintaining
existing workloads. Senior leaders using agents themselves raise
output expectations. Studies show nonmanagers gain far less time
savings, fueling “AI fatigue” and task expansion. While some teams
report higher productivity, much of the output risks becoming
disposable busyware (minor projects or features that consume time but
add little real value). 

 WPP TO SELL ASSETS AND CUT JOBS IN RADICAL SHAKE-UP TO COUNTER AI
THREAT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 WPP is launching a major restructure to become a simpler, lower-cost,
AI-focused business. The London-based group will reorganize into 4
main divisions and regional markets. It is merging key ad agencies,
including Ogilvy, VML, and AKQA, under a shared back office while
keeping them separate. It is also reinvesting savings into AI and
high-growth areas.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TIKTOK & IG VIDEO A/B TESTING LESSONS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Small changes can massively shift results, with identical videos
sometimes getting 10X more views. Format matters too, as greenscreen
videos perform far better on Instagram while talking-head styles can
do better on TikTok. Algorithms are unpredictable, so the best
approach is to repurpose content across platforms and then test
multiple hooks, captions, text, and formats. Iterate on
underperforming videos instead of relying on a single version. 

 LIFECYCLE MARKETING: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CLOSING THE GAPS (14 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Build a foundation before running campaigns. Start with the audience,
not the feature, and use segmentation by fit, behavior, lifecycle
stage, role, and jobs-to-be-done to shape messaging. Gather insights
from product data, support, CS, and sales. Use a shared calendar and
intake workflow to manage requests, and apply priority tiers, QA
checks, and post-send reviews to keep cadence and multi-channel
messaging consistent. Treat ad-hoc sends as learning opportunities.
Once the system works, use AI to speed repetitive tasks. 

 WIN REPORT: HOW AN APPEAL TO EMOTION DOUBLED CONVERSIONS (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Leading with emotion instead of a heavy search form doubled
conversions for a travel booking platform. User research showed
visitors called the original mobile homepage boring and unengaging
because the form appeared before any inspiring content. The winning
redesign reduced the first step to one field and highlighted strong
destination imagery and video. This change increased bookings by 103%
during the test.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 LIFT PIPELINE CONVERSION BY UP TO 118% WITH CONTACT-LEVEL ABM
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 B2B buying is messy. Yet most ABM programs are still orchestrated at
the account level—where buyer behavior gets averaged out, early
signals get missed, and “personalization” becomes a best guess.

Influ2's new data report shows: contact-level ABM can boost pipeline
conversions by up to 118%.

 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO BOOSTING INFLUENCER CONTENT (WEBINAR) [11] 

 Sarah Adam, Head of Influencer Marketing at Wix, and Guy Dotan will
discuss their experience scaling influencer campaigns and how to
handle both organic and paid strategy. The webinar will take place on
March 5 at 11 AM ET. 

 TIP: CLAUDE CODE X HUBSPOT (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 HubSpot workflows are normally limited to a single object, forcing
teams to use APIs, custom scripts, or manual exports to connect
Contacts, Deals, and Companies. Claude Code removes this barrier,
letting you query across multiple objects in natural language without
code. After installing the Claude for HubSpot app, you can open a
workflow and ask Claude to update it using any objects. Review the
draft it generates, then implement the changes directly in HubSpot.
This enables faster and more flexible multi-object automation. 

 GOOGLE DISCOVER ARCHITECTURE: CLUSTERS, CLASSIFIERS, OG TAGS, NAIADES
- WHAT SDK TELEMETRY REVEALS (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google Discover reaches hundreds of millions daily, but its ranking
system is mostly hidden. Content flows through a nine-stage pipeline.
Missing og:image or images under 1,200px block or limit visibility,
and dismissed items remain permanently suppressed. Collection-level
filters can block an entire publisher before ranking. Discover uses 13
cluster types, multiple personalization layers, and about 150
concurrent A/B experiments with 51 feature flags, so similar users can
see very different feeds.

 ONLY ONE COMPANY IN THE WORLD CAN RIVAL GOOGLE'S DISTRIBUTION: META
(6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Meta may have structural advantages over pure play LLM rivals because
of its closed-loop ecosystem. Unlike Google, which risks disrupting
search ads, Meta can experiment with AI answers inside
engagement-driven platforms while preserving monetization. Social
discovery behaviors, from restaurant recommendations to product
research, are already happening inside Instagram and WhatsApp,
creating an entry point for AI-powered search layered onto existing
conversations. Local businesses could see renewed importance in
optimized Meta profiles as discovery shifts from anonymous reviews to
socially informed recommendations. 

 HOW CHATGPT USES SEO TO DRIVE GROWTH AND REVENUE (5 MINUTE READ) [15]


 An SEO audit of ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity shows generative
platforms scaling organic growth through traditional search tactics.
ChatGPT leads with 76.5M monthly organic visits, a projected $92M in
annual revenue at a 0.5% conversion rate and $20 price point, and a
15,200% ROI on an estimated $600K SEO investment. Claude and
Perplexity see 82-240% ROI. ChatGPT outperforms with an authority
score of 99, 288K ranking keywords, optimized robots.txt files, and
UGC that expands indexable pages. Its content strategy gives it an
edge, while Claude and Perplexity rely more on targeted blogs or niche
content but lag in technical SEO and site structure.
