 ADVANCED PMAX FOR LEAD GEN: THE FIRE & ICE STRUCTURE (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Performance Max for lead gen is difficult, but it can be done
successfully with the right campaign structure. The Fire & Ice

mid/upper-funnel channels. The assets, bidding, and campaign settings
should differ between the two. It should result in cheap traffic and

high-quality traffic and a lower amount of high-value conversions from
the ‚Äòfire‚Äô campaign.

 HOW TO NAIL PRODUCT MARKET FIT WITH CLEAR JOBS-TO-BE-DONE (4 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 This case study dissects Letterboxd's onboarding process. Letterboxd
is an app that markets itself as ‚Äúthe social app for film lovers‚Äù.
Its onboarding and signup experience was confusing and left the author
with a poor customer journey. Letterboxd should not have relied on
non-contextual instructions to tell people essential information about
what the app did. Showing users what the app could do as they‚Äôre
discovering it is more effective. In addition, using pop-ups during
onboarding can be a rough way to start a new customer journey. The
author provides alternative UX options to make the experience more
welcoming.
