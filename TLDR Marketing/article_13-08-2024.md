NEWS & TRENDS

 ATTENTION ON SOCIAL IS SHIFTING, AND MARKETERS SHOULD TAKE NOTE (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The social media marketing landscape is evolving as platforms adjust
their algorithms. Meta has shifted away from news content, impacting
publishers' strategies. Reddit's organic referral traffic has surged
sevenfold due to its partnership with Google. LinkedIn is seeing
higher engagement through newsletters, while Meta and X penalize link
posts, leading publishers to explore new opportunities. Ad budgets are
shifting from X to Snapchat and Reddit, with notable increases in
spending from small and medium-sized businesses. 

 AMAZON PRIME DAY DRIVES THE MOST LOYALTY AMONG SUMMER SALES EVENTS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amazon Prime Day has proven to be the most effective summer sales
event, with 84% of shoppers only purchasing from Amazon during this
period. About 19% of Amazon shoppers made purchases during Prime Day,
compared to 12% at Target, 5% at TikTok Shop, and only 2% each for
Walmart online and Wayfair. Amazon's sales surged by 46% during the
week of Prime Day compared to the previous 4 weeks. It outpaced other
events like Wayfair's Black Friday in July, which rose by 42%.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CONSISTENCY & CEREAL: HOW TO MAKE YOUR MESSAGE MORE STICKY (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Cereal brands are models of consistency due to their repeated use of
taglines and branding. A person must hear about your brand many times
before they'll remember it, let alone be moved enough to buy something
from you. Companies may choose to drive home a category, a use case, a
tagline, or a slogan repeatedly and consistently in order to build a
memorable brand. Doing customer research and listening to how people
talk about your brand can help you hone the right message. 

 HOW TO TEST BROAD MATCH KEYWORDS WITHOUT WASTING SPEND (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 To avoid wasting ad spend, start a new campaign with select
top-performing keywords. Avoid switching all match types to broad
match at once to prevent inefficiencies. Monitor performance
long-term, as broad match keywords take time to optimize. Conduct
daily search term checks to refine targeting and add negative keywords
as needed. Use automated bidding strategies like Target CPA or ROAS,
and include thematically similar keywords to enhance learning while
avoiding Single Keyword Ad Groups.

 HOW TO FIND YOUR FIRST ICP GUIDE (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) describes your ideal customer.
Without a defined ICP, your company risks wasted marketing spend,
lower conversion rates, and product-market misalignment. Start with
details like company size, industry, use cases, and buyer personas.
Use quantitative, qualitative, and market analysis to identify
profitable segments, understand customer needs, and uncover
competitive dynamics. Continually refine your ICP as you gain new
insights into the market and your customers.

 SEARCH INTENT AND THE ORGANIC FUNNEL (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Search intent aligns with the stages of the organic SEO funnel.
Informational searches at the top have low organic visibility due to
features like snippets, so targeting keywords with organic results in
position one is key. Commercial searches face tough competition from
sites like Reddit and Amazon. Transactional keywords have less
competition and offer opportunities, especially in local searches.
Navigational searches, often post-conversion, require brands to
dominate search results with their content and social media channels.
