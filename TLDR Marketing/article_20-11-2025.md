NEWS & TRENDS

 THE FUTURE OF MEDIA IS BEING BUILT ON YOUTUBE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 YouTube is becoming the hub for new media. It's drawing legacy
publishers and independent creators. The Daily Beast and Complex are
shifting to video to reach younger audiences and protect against AI
disruption. Its monetization tools, high-quality attention, and low
production barriers make it more profitable than text or short-form
social platforms. Vodcasts, live-streams, and AI-assisted production
are fueling growth. Creators now treat it as their main distribution
point, building audiences before converting fans to subscriptions or
donations. 

 OPENAI'S FIDJI SIMO PLANS TO MAKE CHATGPT WAY MORE USEFUL–AND HAVE
YOU PAY FOR IT (13 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Fidji Simo is steering OpenAI toward product-driven growth,
positioning ChatGPT as a paid utility for shopping, planning, and
work. This will change how people discover and evaluate products.
Pulse shows how AI can deliver timely, personalized guidance, hinting
at high-intent opportunities once compute expands. OpenAI is also
tightening safety and privacy standards, which will shape how AI
experiences are designed. AI-native commerce is accelerating, chat is
emerging as a key recommendation channel, and ad models are evolving
beyond traditional targeting.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW I RUN A LINKEDIN B2B GROWTH ENGINE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This author uses a simple LinkedIn playbook to drive over $1M+ in
pipeline while spending only $300 per month on ads. It starts with
consistent founder-led content that helped the startup reach nearly
15,000 new followers in a year. It then expands reach through
influencer partnerships and boosts only top-performing posts, which
deliver click-through rates near 20%. Daily engagement through
comments, connections, and value-first messaging keeps the flywheel
moving and creates steady visibility among the ICP. 

 8 MARKETING TACTICS THAT WORK ON BOOMERS, BUT YOUNGER GENERATIONS SEE
THROUGH (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Marketing tactics that still appeal to Boomers, such as expert
endorsements, emotional testimonials, and physical catalogs, often
miss the mark with younger generations who expect transparency and
verification. Boomers respond to traditional signals of trust like
phone access, scarcity messaging, and authority figures, while Gen Z
and Millennials rely on peer reviews, independent research, and
digital convenience.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 A/B TEST RESULT: PAGE LOAD TIME (PERFORMANCE) PATTERN (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Talabat A/B tested a decrease in its homepage load time, which led to
a measurable lift in revenue and orders. The time-to-interactive
decreased from about 2.1 seconds to about 1.0 second, a drop of about
58%. As a result, revenue per user increased by 0.36% and orders per
user rose by 0.34%. The results align with prior evidence that even
small performance gains can drive meaningful business impact. 

 MORE WAYS TO SPOT, SHAPE, AND UNDERSTAND AI-GENERATED CONTENT ON
TIKTOK (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 TikTok is expanding its tools to help users control, identify, and
understand AI-generated content. This includes a new setting that lets
users choose how much AI-generated content appears in their feed. It
is also adding invisible watermarking to improve labeling reliability,
which supports its existing systems that have already labeled over 1.3
billion videos.

 YOU CAN'T DISMISS AI ADS AS SLOP WHEN THEY'RE WINNING IN TESTING (7
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI-assisted ads outperform traditional ones, scoring higher on
emotion, attention, and distinctiveness. Even when recognized as
AI-made, they evoke strong responses. AI lets smaller brands create
cinematic, high-impact content previously out of reach. Ads also
perform well with LLMs, showing potential for campaigns targeting both
humans and AI. 

 BECOMING THE CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF YOUR CAREER (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Think of a career as a creative project rather than a ladder to
climb. Own the professional narrative, shape what work matters, and
design how presence is perceived in every interaction. Treat roles,
projects, and skills as parts of a larger body of work. Optimize for
growth and enjoyment rather than just titles or salary. Cultivate
instincts for when to pivot, pause, or fully commit, and bring
intentionality and play to daily work. This mindset transforms work
into a living composition, where each project contributes to a
purposeful career. 

 US USERS WANT TO QUIT INSTAGRAM MORE THAN OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS
(6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 US search data shows that nearly 2M users per month are seeking ways
to delete or deactivate social media accounts. Instagram leads the
list, followed by TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, and X. Instagram's high
user dissatisfaction is tied to a growing recognition of addiction
patterns driven by algorithmic design and self-comparison loops.
TikTok also draws concern for its time distortion and high
reactivation rate, while Facebook sees regret-driven account
recoveries despite privacy concerns. Platforms like Reddit, Pinterest,
and Threads generate minimal exit interest due to stronger perceived
value, niche use cases, or integration barriers.
