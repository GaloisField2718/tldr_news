STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO MAKE BRAND NAMES MORE MEMORABLE (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Memorable brand names often use strong consonants (like P, T, and K)
and features like alliteration, puns, or wordplay to help customers
recall them more easily. Names that link clearly to a product's
function (e.g., Energizer) create mental associations that improve
retention. Unusual spellings can aid memory (especially for new
brands), while blended names (e.g., Duracell) can be harder to
remember. However, studies only suggest a correlation - more recent
research shows that misspelled names may have a negative effect. 

 2 SEO PROJECTS TO PRIORITIZE FOR 2025 (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 With Google traffic declining, SEOs should prioritize conversion rate

traffic. Collaborating with PR and social media to increase brand
awareness will help improve search rankings and site traffic. Tracking
brand search volume, post-purchase surveys, and mentions in "best of"
lists or Reddit threads can help measure the success of these efforts.

(6 MINUTE READ) [15]
