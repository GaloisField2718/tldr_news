NEWS & TRENDS

 FRUSTRATED WITH TODAY'S ‘ATTENTION ECONOMY'? YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO
HATE WHAT COMES NEXT (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The ‘intention economy,' fueled by AI, will create a digital
marketplace where companies commodify and sell predictions of users'
future actions. Companies can map evolving thought patterns to
forecast behaviors by analyzing conversational data, offering
unprecedented targeting capabilities for advertisers. Researchers from
the University of Cambridge warn that this evolution will erode
privacy, enable subtle manipulation of beliefs, and undermine
democratic norms. With AI chatbots acting as intermediaries, this
marks an important shift from the attention economy, turning personal
motivations into a powerful and profitable currency. 

 SUBSTACK ADVERTISING IS TURNING WRITERS INTO PART-TIME SALES REPS (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Substack writers are taking on advertising sales, managing deals
directly with brands, often through DIY methods like Google Docs. Ad
prices vary widely, with small mentions costing around $100 and larger
sponsorships reaching up to $20K. While Substack focuses on
subscription revenue, some writers, like Alex Kantrowitz of Big
Technology, earn more from ads. New platforms like Beehiiv offer
semi-automated ad networks, but many writers prefer handling deals
independently, despite the operational challenges.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHEN SHOULD YOU INVEST IN PAID MARKETING? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Premature investment in paid marketing often leads to high costs,
poor results, and unsustainable growth. Companies should ensure
product-market fit first, with churn below 25% and retention metrics
in place. Landing pages must be optimized for clarity, speed, mobile
use, and conversion. Organic marketing like SEO and product-led growth
is crucial for sustainable traffic before investing in paid channels.
Paid marketing requires technical preparation, reliable data systems,
and a budget of at least $75K over 6 months to achieve scaled growth
and acceptable ROI. 

 F* EASY CONTENT - 3 TECHNIQUES TO MAKE YOUR NEXT ARTICLE STAND OUT (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most content fails because it's too simple to create, forgettable to
read, and lacks depth. Techniques like weaving strong opinions
throughout, sharing personal anecdotes to ground ideas in real-world
experiences, and writing "How I" pieces that showcase firsthand
problem-solving elevate content from generic to compelling. While more
time-consuming to execute, these methods create a distinctive voice.

 HOW THE CURSE OF KNOWLEDGE RUINS BRANDS' VALUE (AND HOW TO AVOID IT)
(4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Dropbox struggled to communicate its value due to the "curse of
expertise," where deep knowledge made simple explanations difficult. A
new explainer video featuring a "magic pocket" story drove significant
growth by making the message relatable and clear. Examples from
Rolls-Royce, Volvo, and JFK's moon pledge show how focusing on key
benefits, crafting compelling narratives, and delivering unexpected
messages can improve communication. 

 THE TRUTH ABOUT GETTING PROMOTED IN PRODUCT MARKETING (9 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Promotions in product marketing depend on strategy, timing, and
visibility. Ensure you work for a company that values career growth
and has a supportive manager who advocates for team members. Focus on
impactful work rather than mastering every skill - excel in one or two
high-value areas like product launches or positioning while
maintaining broad exposure elsewhere. Build visibility, influence, and
strategic thinking, as these skills are essential for long-term career
growth. Periodically assess your environment and create a plan to
close skill gaps and align your expertise with your target role.
