 TYPEFORM SURVEY: THE DATA ON INFLUENCER MARKETING HAS SPOKEN (14
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 71% of consumers regret purchases made through influencer
recommendations, with only 33% believing influencers actually use the
products they promote. The trust gap stems from inauthentic
engagement, lack of transparency, and overly polished content. 40% of
consumers say relatability is the top reason they trust an influencer.
While 81% of influencers use AI in content creation, 35% of consumers
distrust AI-generated posts, and 61% want AI use disclosed. 56% of
influencers admitted to promoting products they don't like, and 33%
have bought followers or engagement. Consumers now favor creators who
feel genuine and share real, personal stories. 

 RETHINK YOUR PRICING STRATEGIES AMID ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY (11 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 More than half of customers who consider a low-price option
ultimately trade up when offered clear, tiered choices that
differentiate value. This underscores the effectiveness of good,
better, best pricing strategies, which highlight product value and
allow businesses to serve price-sensitive customers without
undermining premium offerings. During periods of economic uncertainty,
marketers can use this structure not just to defend margins but also
to influence buyer psychology, emphasizing long-term value and giving
customers a sense of control without defaulting to broad price cuts.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TIPS FOR REDUCING SHOPPING CART ABANDONMENT (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 To minimize cart abandonment, offer transparent pricing, guest
checkout, and a streamlined, mobile-friendly checkout experience. Use
progress indicators, trusted security badges, and multiple payment and
shipping options. Prevent errors with regular site testing and speed
optimization. Encourage purchases with working promo codes, wishlist
features, and automated cart recovery emails. Send emails within 1-3
hours, follow up within 24-48 hours, and always personalize content.
Cart recovery automation can improve conversion rates by over 2,300%
compared to manual campaigns. 

 MARKETING MASTERS: ARCHITECTS OF REAL-TIME PERSONALISATION (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Tractive uses rapid experimentation to scale 1:1 personalization. It
starts with small tests like swapping hero images with breed-specific
visuals, then expands to fully personalized email templates. This
approach boosted click rates by up to 82%. The company also tailors
winback emails based on cancellation reasons, offering targeted
incentives that led to a 30% reactivation increase. Testing showed
customer testimonials drove 100% higher engagement than celebrity
content. Secret Escapes collaborates with data scientists to build
behavior-triggered, AI-powered journeys. During Black Friday, it used
dynamic content blocks to show users previously browsed hotels at
discounted rates, increasing click-throughs by 23%. 

 CLEAR BEATS CLEVER: WRITING FOR FAST FEEDS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The average user spends less than one second deciding whether to
engage with content, making clarity more critical than creativity in
social feed environments. Clever writing often delays understanding,
while direct, benefit-led messaging improves retention, engagement,
and action. Marketers should treat clarity not as a compromise but as
a competitive advantage and focus later on making it more interesting.

 HOW TO GROW A BRAND YOUTUBE CHANNEL (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Click-through rate and average view duration are the two most
important indicators of video performance on YouTube. Leading brands
optimize these by investing time to create strong titles and
thumbnails, studying what holds attention, and aligning video concepts
with proven emotional drivers. High-performing content is often rooted
in formats that are already familiar to viewers, adapted to the
brand's voice and audience insights uncovered through extensive
customer research.

 SHOULD BRANDS BLOCK THEIR COMPETITORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA? (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Brands should consider blocking competitors on social media when
those competitors use comment sections to attack or undermine them.
For example, Lingoda, a smaller language-learning app, publicly
criticized Duolingo after Duolingo announced an AI-first approach,
sparking a viral comment with over 17,000 likes. Although this likely
didn't harm Duolingo's subscribers, it increased awareness of Lingoda
among Duolingo's followers. Deleting hostile comments and blocking
competitors helps protect the community and brand presence. While some
fear blocking looks insecure, this concern is not strong. Brands
should stay ready to act when competitors cross the line but don't
need to block proactively. 

 THE UPSIDE OF DOWN: WHY NEGATIVE ADS CAN BE POSITIVELY BRILLIANT (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Brands should not avoid negativity in advertising, as embracing
honest flaws can make campaigns more memorable. Classic ads like
Buckley's “It Tastes Awful. And It Works” show how acknowledging
imperfections builds stronger connections with audiences. Today's
safer, bland ads often fail to capture attention, wasting marketing
budgets. Research shows ads evoking negative emotions are almost twice
as memorable as dull ones, seen in campaigns like Sky Stream's “End
the ehhh” and Burger King's Mouldy Whopper, which increased positive
brand perception despite unappetizing imagery. 

 WHY ONE COMPANY WENT ALL IN ON MARATHONS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Rather than spreading sponsorship across multiple sports, TCS chose
to focus exclusively on marathons to build deeper, more personal
relationships with customers and employees. With a third of its
600,000 employees identifying as runners, the company activates
hospitality, tech tools, and branding across 14 global races to turn
each event into a brand experience. The approach drives both emotional
relevance and business value, with up to $20 million in media exposure
per race and a significantly higher brand lift among marathon
participants.
