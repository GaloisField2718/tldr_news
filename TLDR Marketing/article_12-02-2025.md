 THE 2025 ADVERTISING & MARKETING REPORT (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Brands are reallocating budgets to balance customer acquisition and
brand awareness. Paid social and search remain priorities but face
increasing costs, algorithm shifts, and new restrictions, pushing
teams to diversify. TV advertising is gaining traction alongside
influencer marketing. AI is streamlining media buying, ad copy, and
audience segmentation. Key tactics include retargeting website
visitors via TV ads, leveraging ad-supported streaming platforms, and
integrating conversational AI for customer engagement. 

 TIKTOK WANTS ANDROID USERS TO SIDELOAD ITS APP (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TikTok now offers its Android app as a direct download from its
website, allowing users to sideload it as an APK file instead of
relying on the Google Play Store. This move helps the company bypass
the ongoing app store ban while the US government's restrictions
remain paused.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THIS FUN WRITING TECHNIQUE ADDS ENERGY AND EMOTION TO YOUR WRITING (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Broken sentences and sentence fragments can add impact and emotion to
informal writing, despite being frowned upon in traditional style
guides. Authors use them to create a modern, conversational tone that
enhances flow and precision. Techniques include starting with
conjunctions, emphasizing emotion with short sentences, and creating
staccato rhythms or quickened pacing. These fragments can mimic
thought patterns or present lists for dynamic storytelling. However,
overuse can feel forced, so writers should use them intentionally,
paying close attention to rhythm and flow. 

 14 TIPS TO GROW A CEO'S LINKEDIN PRESENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To build a LinkedIn presence for a CEO from scratch, optimize their
profile with a clean headshot, banner, and a headline explaining the
company's value. Schedule a meeting to record the conversation for 10
posts, then pair each with relevant media. Review and refine posts,
create a list of 15-20 accounts to engage with daily, and connect with
20 new prospects using Sales Navigator. Track profile metrics weekly,
respond to comments, and personalize outreach to profile visitors with
valuable resources. 

 SHOULD YOU HAVE A HARD PAYWALL? (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A hard paywall, which blocks access to an app unless users start a
free trial or subscription, can help focus on high-intent users,
improve conversion signals for ad algorithms, and simplify analytics.
However, it limits the user base, reduces opportunities for nurturing
potential subscribers, and can hurt app store rankings due to higher
uninstall rates. To mitigate its downsides, companies can implement
tactics like capturing email addresses, using push notifications,
offering backup discounts, or providing a preview during onboarding.

[13] 

 Writing effective product descriptions requires focusing on customer

 WHEN TO DIAGONALLY TILT YOUR TEXT (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tilting text or logos upward (bottom-left to top-right) signals
energy and activity, while tilting downward (top-left to bottom-right)
conveys calmness and relaxation. Experiments showed people were 44.5%
more likely to buy exercise-related products with upward-tilting
logos. Resorts marketed as adventurous saw a 20.6% higher likelihood
of booking with upward-tilted ads, while relaxing resorts were
preferred 17.7% more with downward-tilted text. The effect works for
both text and logos but not for images. Horizontally flat logos are
best if neither energy nor relaxation is emphasized. 

 POPPI'S MARKETING GOES TARTE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Poppi's Super Bowl vending machine campaign generated over 35M
organic views, but generated backlash as consumers criticized it
saying it was ‘wasteful'. Experiential gifting, where brands provide
influencers with over-the-top experiences instead of traditional
sponsorships, makes marketing spend highly visible, potentially
sparking negative sentiment. As customer-first marketing gains
traction, brands prioritizing real consumer engagement over influencer
spectacle may better align with shifting expectations.
