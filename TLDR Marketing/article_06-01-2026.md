NEWS & TRENDS

 HERE'S WHAT AMAZON IS TELLING ADVERTISERS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Amazon is telling advertisers it will anchor 2026 plans on
authenticated reach, programmatic simplicity, live sports, and applied
AI. It claims its Authenticated Graph can connect advertisers to 90%
of US households across the open internet using verified signals. The
company is pushing Amazon DSP as a single buying tool that unlocks
premium partners like Netflix and Disney programmatically. Live sports
is a growth driver as Prime Video saw a 40% increase in Black Friday
advertisers and nearly 50% growth from non-endemic brands year over
year. 

 INSTAGRAM HEAD ADAM MOSSERI SEES CREATOR VALUE RISING AS AI FLOODS
SOCIAL FEEDS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adam Mosseri predicts that creators' value will rise because
credibility will outweigh technical quality. Authenticity is becoming
scarce, and audiences will prioritize work tied to an individual.
Instagram is shifting toward raw, informal content that signals real
authorship while deprioritizing templated or mass-produced posts.

 WHAT IS AN A/A TEST AND WHEN DO I HAVE TO RUN ONE? (10 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A/A testing helps verify that A/B testing tools are functioning
correctly by splitting traffic between identical pages to check for
data accuracy and randomness. It builds confidence in test results by
revealing baseline conversion rates and natural variance, critical for
interpreting future experiments. While not designed to uncover new
insights, A/A tests are valuable for validating tools, identifying
setup errors, and estimating sample sizes. 

 8 INTERNAL COMMS IDEAS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 People are leaning into nostalgia with advice columns, hotlines, and
hyper-specific day-in-the-life profiles. Teams are asking for replies
in emails and actually following up, while survey results are shared
alongside immediate action items. Managers get their own channels for
early updates, holidays come with real expectations like logging off,
and customer stories make everyone feel proud. Some teams are even
testing messaging with custom GPTs and doing year-in-review videos
with team commentary.

 ZAPIER'S CEO SHARES HIS PERSONAL AI STACK (42 MINUTE PODCAST) [10] 

 Zapier's CEO, Wade Foster, embeds AI across key operations using
tools like Granola, which records and transcribes meetings, allowing
him to analyze cultural patterns and generate interview rubrics.
Foster builds Zapier Agents that evaluate candidates based on
transcripts, job descriptions, and cultural fit, then email structured
hiring recommendations. He uses Copilot to tune these prompts,
including adding feedback on interview quality and surfacing missing
questions. For sourcing talent, he taps Grok to find niche creators or
“chronically online” users discussing automation, targeting
low-follower experts outside major tech hubs for roles like social
media.

health impacts of traditional social media, Tangle focuses on
intentionality. It is currently in invite-only beta and part of a
broader movement toward healthier digital experiences.

 HOW BIG ARE GOOGLE'S GROUNDING CHUNKS? (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google uses a fixed grounding budget of about 2,000 words per query,
and page length does not increase that limit. It splits this budget by
relevance rank, where the #1 source gets about 531 words or 28% and
the #5 source gets about 266 words or 13%. Most pages receive about
377 words, and 77% of pages fall between 200 and 600 words selected.
Coverage drops as pages get longer, since pages over 2,000 words
average about 13% coverage and grounding plateaus near 540 words.
Concise and dense content is more effective than long pages. 

 HOW PANTONE TRANSLATES GLOBAL MOODS INTO COLOUR (3 MINUTE READ) [13]

reset.

removed 30X more products through proactive checks than after reports.
Its IPR decisions were correct in over 89% of cases. Stronger
protection matters because 23% of adults globally have lost money to
