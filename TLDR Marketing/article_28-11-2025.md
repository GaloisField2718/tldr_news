NEWS & TRENDS

 AS AI RESHAPES SHOPPING, US RETAILERS TRY TO CHANGE HOW THEY'RE SEEN
ONLINE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 US retailers see AI agents as a new gateway for holiday shopping and
are shifting tactics to appear in AI-driven recommendations. Companies
are posting far more content and even creating invisible websites for
AI scrapers because ChatGPT referrals to major retailers still account
for less than 1% of traffic. Some brands are using influencers,
awards, and voice assistant ads to increase the data that AI tools
draw from, while others rely on Google's expanding AI shopping
features to surface products. Amazon said shoppers using its Rufus
agent are 60% more likely to buy products, which signals how valuable
AI-guided traffic could become. 

 THE 5 MEDIA TRENDS I'M THANKFUL FOR (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pay-per-crawl experiments are creating ways for publishers to
monetize AI use of their content. Vodcasts and creator-inspired
formats are helping publishers reach audiences with more engaging
video. Independent, creator-led media is scaling sustainably through
subscriptions. Publishers are increasingly embracing marketing,
running brand campaigns and paid promotions to highlight their
credibility.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AI COPYWRITING WORKFLOW (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The key to high-quality AI-generated website copy is a structured
workflow rather than a single prompt. Start with a base like a
positioning memo and brand voice guide, then feed AI-rich context from
customer transcripts to create persona briefs that capture pain
points, transformations, and quotes. Use those briefs to craft a
website styling guide that mirrors customer language, define page
structure and content order, then generate copy with all guardrails
attached. Human edits between steps refine it to near-final quality. 

 WHY YOUR PRODUCT RELEASE EMAILS GET IGNORED (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Product release emails fail because users are flooded with
announcements. They care about outcomes, not features. To improve
opens and adoption, use subject lines that highlight benefits. Keep
emails under 30 seconds, show the feature with a GIF or diagram, focus
on benefits over features, use one clear CTA, and segment audiences by
usage or role. Simple, human language with visual proof and targeted
messaging ensures your email drives product use.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 IS META EXPANDING CREATIVE TESTING TO 10 ADS? (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta has quietly expanded its Creative Testing tool to support up to
10 ad variations in a single ad set, doubling the previous limit of
five. This change benefits companies with ample creative resources,
allowing broader testing within Meta's structured environment.
However, the tool still requires new ad creation for testing, which
can slow workflows. 

 13 OF THE BEST SEO BLOGS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article features 13 SEO blogs that produce operationally
relevant insights backed by data and experimentation. Each blog is run
by experienced practitioners who actively test AI visibility, traffic
attribution, and content ranking factors. Highlights include research
into how ChatGPT filters sources by freshness and authority, GA4
attribution models for AI browsers, and how long-tail queries are less
affected by declining click-through rates. For brands adjusting to
AI-dominated search results, these blogs offer strategic guidance on
entity modeling, structured content, and new SERP patterns.

 WHY YOUNG PEOPLE MIGHT WANT A CD PLAYER FOR CHRISTMAS (2 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Gen Z is driving renewed interest in physical music formats and is
adding CD players to Christmas wishlists as part of a broader search
for nostalgia and community. A survey found that 76% of Gen Z shop for
records once a month, 80% own a record player, and 84% shop for
records in-store. Many young people value physical music because 76%
want a tangible copy and 57% prefer the in-store experience. This
trend reflects the influence of culture and the desire for belonging,
which creates opportunities for product innovation and authentic
community engagement. 

 HOW ADVERTISING SHAPED THANKSGIVING AS WE KNOW IT (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 The Thanksgiving table as we know it today was largely constructed
through deliberate brand positioning rather than historical accuracy.
Products like turkey, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie were
consolidated into the American holiday experience through nearly a
century of advertising in publications such as Good Housekeeping.
Brands focused on making these items feel essential, not only by
promoting product features but also by associating them with emotional
themes like family, gratitude, and tradition. 

 AI MODELS ARE BECOMING INFLUENCERS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI models are becoming trusted advisors, not search engines. Last
year saw 700 million product conversations, mostly seeking
recommendations. Buyers provide context and expect tailored guidance,
prompting models to act like influencers who form opinions and
recommend the best fit. Opinions are shaped by what models can read,
so clarity, specificity, and consistent proof build trust. Brands must
understand AI perceptions, identify harmful assumptions, and create
content that improves recommendations.
