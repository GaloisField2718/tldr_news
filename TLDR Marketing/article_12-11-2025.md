NEWS & TRENDS

 TIKTOK SHOP REACHES EBAY SALES VOLUME DESPITE REGULATORY HEADWINDS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TikTok Shop reached $19 billion in global quarterly sales, matching
eBay's volume, as its US market grew 125% quarter-over-quarter despite
regulatory pressure. The platform's rapid growth stems from its
“discovery e-commerce” model, where 83% of shoppers find new
products and 70% find new brands through shoppable videos and
livestreams. Livestream shopping remains limited in the US, accounting
for only 2% of traffic, although livestream sessions rose 72%
year-over-year in September. Southeast Asia continues to outperform
the US in adoption, while over 171,000 small businesses now sell on
TikTok Shop as it tightens merchant vetting and expands across key
retail categories. 

 SMALL BUSINESS OPTIMISM TAKES A SMALL STEP BACK AS UNCERTAINTY EASES
IN OCTOBER (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Small business optimism fell slightly last month, with the NFIB Index
dropping 0.6 points to 98.2 as owners reported lower sales and
declining profits. Hiring remains difficult, with 32% of firms unable
to fill job openings and 27% citing labor quality as their top
problem. Inflation, supply chain issues, and rising costs continue to
challenge businesses, though fewer cited financing or insurance as
major problems.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FAQ PAGES ARE COOLER THAN EVER (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Adding FAQ sections to Webflow's template pages drove large traffic
growth, especially from non-branded queries. Treated pages saw up to
8% lift while non-FAQ pages declined. FAQs captured high-intent,
long-tail searches like “template website free” and increased AI
search engagement. Clear and structured content can outperform
traditional SEO tactics, making FAQs a powerful tool for
discoverability. 

 THE GROWTH STRATEGY MOST STARTUPS OVERLOOK: ENGINEERING-AS-MARKETING
(7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Engineering-as-Marketing turns product or engineering time into a
growth engine by creating free tools that attract and convert users
through usefulness instead of promotion. It builds trust and organic
reach by giving value upfront, leading to long-term traffic and
compounding returns that paid ads cannot match. Examples like
HubSpot's Website Grader, Shopify's Hatchful, and Ahrefs' free SEO
tools show how offering helpful resources drives leads, backlinks, and
brand awareness. Startups can apply this by building small, practical
tools that solve real problems, launching them strategically, and
optimizing for SEO to generate lasting growth.

was both chaotic and deeply ingrained in local culture. The initiative
showed how unconventional ideas can be converted into high-impact
community storytelling. Though not optimized for scale or efficiency,

identity.
