 CREATIVE TRENDS FOR REDDIT-FIRST CAMPAIGNS IN 2026 (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Reddit campaigns are focusing on 4 trends. Nostalgia-driven
storytelling connects through shared memories and early internet
aesthetics using imperfect visuals. User-generated social proof
highlights real community posts to build trust. Niche-inspired
campaigns speak directly to specific passions and subcultures using
their language and style. Campaigns are designed to unfold publicly,
letting the community shape the story and evolve the narrative over
time. 

 WHY 2026 MUST BE THE YEAR BRANDS BET ON THEIR OWN TEAMS (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 More brands are building in-house agencies as strategic assets rather
than cost-saving experiments. Nearly 9 in 10 now operate internal
creative teams. However, many remain underpowered because they are
treated as executional support rather than full partners. Without
clear operating models, proximity to the brand goes to waste.
Investing in culture and empowerment allows these teams to perform at
their best.

 FORMULA FOR CREATING 10 B2B CAROUSELS/WEEK (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Carousels continue to perform well on LinkedIn, with the front cover
doing 80% of the work. Use a title that is clear, specific, and easy
to skim. Combine words with images, screenshots, or emojis to signal
the content and give viewers a reason to stop scrolling. Maintain a
consistent structure with predictable headings and clear hierarchy.
End with a question to encourage comments and interaction. 

 5 WEBINAR TIPS TO INCREASE REGISTRATIONS AND ATTENDANCE RATES (1
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To increase show-up rates, send an email within 4 hours of the event.
Test whether using “tomorrow” or the actual day in the subject
line performs better. Include a bracket at the start of the subject,
such as (Today!) or (Going live in 1 hour), to signal urgency. Replace
the word “webinar” with alternatives like live event, digital
workshop, insider session, or live panel to make the invitation feel
more engaging.

 WHO IS YOUR WEBSITE REALLY FOR? (SPONSOR) [9] 

 If AI handles discovery and research for buyers, your site needs to
work for retrieval bots, not just humans. Scrunch reveals how AI
agents experience your site—what gets surfaced, ignored, and why.

 HOW TO MINE GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE FOR CONVERSATION DATA (5 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Google Search Console (GSC) can surface long conversational queries
that look like AI prompts, which gives marketers a practical data
source for prompt tracking even though LLM platforms like OpenAI and
Google do not fully share prompt data. Some AI-related queries and AI
Mode data appear in GSC, and impressions have risen over the last
three months during AI feature rollouts. Use a regex filter for
queries that contain 10 or more words to identify prompt-style
searches that often read like detailed questions or tasks. Export
these queries and analyze them in tools like Claude to uncover
customer concerns, brand comparisons, price sensitivity, and recurring
reputation topics. 

 PERPLEXITY PULLING SPONSORED ANSWERS FROM AI PLATFORM (2 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Perplexity is phasing out sponsored answers, stepping back from one
of the earliest experiments in chatbot advertising. Executives said
even clearly labeled ads risk undermining user trust, which is
critical to driving subscriptions and repeat usage. The move contrasts
with rivals like OpenAI and Google, which are testing ads within AI
responses to offset rising infrastructure costs. As AI adoption
surpasses 60% among US adults, platforms are diverging on whether
long-term revenue should come from ads, enterprise contracts, or paid
tiers.

 TRUSTWORTHY A/B PATTERNS AND THE WINNER'S CURSE: LESSONS FROM SEVEN
LARGE-SCALE REPLICATIONS (20 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Large-scale replications show that popular A/B test patterns often
produce much smaller gains than earlier reports suggest, and most
reported large lifts come from underpowered studies. Even very large
experiments often lack enough power for core metrics like
revenue-per-user and purchase rate, so teams often must rely on
surrogate metrics like click rate and add-to-cart rate. Real-world
results from companies such as Bing, Amazon, and Talabat show that
typical trustworthy lifts are often below 1%, not the double-digit
gains seen in case libraries. The evidence supports that low-power
tests below 50% power create exaggerated winners and frequent false
positives, which explains why many published pattern wins fail to
replicate at scale. 

 SOMETHING MESSY IS HAPPENING: ON AI, PANIC, AND ASKING BETTER
QUESTIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article challenges viral predictions that AI will eliminate half
of white-collar jobs within 5 years. It argues that capability does
not equal immediate displacement and that adoption depends on
regulation and human behavior. While AI can generate copy and surface
data faster, it cannot replace human judgment around audience nuance
or brand risk in volatile moments. The takeaway is to integrate AI
into existing workflows thoughtfully rather than restructuring careers
or teams around fear-driven forecasts. 

 NOT EVERY GREAT PMM SHOULD MANAGE PEOPLE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Promoting a top IC into management often fails because expanding
scope and managing people are separate decisions. ICs excel through
personal ownership and execution, while managers succeed by coaching
and enabling teams to deliver without them. The true signal is lift,
whether those around them improve, not individual performance.
Management should not be treated as the default next step. Career
paths should reward influence and ownership, not just headcount.
