 ROBLOX PARTNERS WITH GOOGLE ON ADS (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Advertisers can now buy Roblox's Rewarded Video and immersive formats
via Google Ad Manager. Reaching millions of Gen Z users who play
daily, these 30-second ads reward players with in-game perks and have
shown over 80% completion rates during testing. Roblox also partnered
with measurement providers like Kantar, IAS, and Cint to help validate
campaign performance. 

 TRANSFORMING DISABILITY INCLUSION IN THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY (7 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Beyond the Brief, launched by With Not For, challenges the creative
industry to embed accessibility into storytelling and workplace
practices rather than relying on token representation. With disabled
professionals facing significant employment barriers, the initiative
provides training, representation workshops, and inclusive hiring
support to drive systemic change. Agencies are encouraged to integrate
accessibility across all projects, not just diversity-focused
campaigns.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BETTER ‘WELCOME' EMAILS FOR ECOMMERCE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 60% of subscribers open welcome emails, but generic messages fail to
drive action. Effective welcome emails align with a brand's strategy
while using credibility, storytelling, and engagement paths to build
long-term relationships. Strong campaigns include multi-email
sequences that highlight product benefits, address concerns, and offer
multiple calls to action beyond “Shop now.” Success should be
measured by conversion rates, retention beyond 60 days, and revenue
per subscriber. 

 ADS FOR BUSY VS. RELAXED PEOPLE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Busy people prefer ads with clear, factual messaging, while relaxed
people respond better to emotional, experience-driven ads. A study
which analyzed over 570,000 mobile ad views found that busy consumers
rated products higher when ads emphasized functionality while relaxed
consumers preferred emotional appeals. Marketers should tailor ads
based on when and where they will be seen—straightforward messaging
for busy contexts like work hours and emotional storytelling for
relaxed settings like weekends. The study was conducted in China, so
results may not generalize globally, and it did not measure actual
sales impact. 

 SATISFACTION GUARANTEE: PROS & CONS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Satisfaction guarantees can significantly boost customer trust,
reduce perceived risk, and increase conversion rates, particularly
when aligned with a brand's positioning. This article outlines 11
examples from brands like Costco (risk-free returns, including
membership refunds), REI (one-year returns for members), and Osprey
(lifetime repair guarantee), illustrating how different industries
tailor policies to fit customer expectations. Before implementing a
similar strategy, it is critical to weigh ROI by tracking return
costs, impact on customer acquisition, satisfaction scores, and repeat
purchase behavior.

 TRADER JOE'S ROASTS IN-STORE RETAIL MEDIA (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Committed to delivering a “wow” experience based on human
connection, Trader Joe's has doubled down on its anti-tech retail
strategy. Executives dismissed in-store retail media as a response to
poor grocery experiences and confirmed the company's refusal to adopt
tools like smart carts, self-checkout, or data-driven personalization.
The brand's in-store model relies on knowledgeable crew members and
shelf-level data to create a high-touch, personable in-store
environment. 

 APRIL FOOLS' DAY 2025: THE BEST AND CRINGIEST PRANKS (4 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 This year's April Fools' campaigns highlight a shift from pure pranks
to limited-run products and satirical content. Some companies leaned
into humor with actual products, like Dbrand's tactile “Touch
Grass” skins and Razer's AI “Skibidi” translator headset.
Others, like OpenAI's sarcastic voice mode “Monday” and Figma's
cursor-trailing FigPals, highlighted how brands now blur satire and
soft launches to test audience appetite for novelty in a lower risk
context.
