NEWS & TRENDS

 PINTEREST PREDICTS 2026: 21 TRENDS (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Pinterest predicts next year's trends across home, fashion, beauty,
food, and travel will be nostalgic and sensory-driven. Afrobohemian
home decor searches are up 220% and adire fabric 130%, while men's
maximalist accessories rise 105%. Cabbage-based dishes are gaining
popularity, with cabbage dumplings up 110% and golumpki soup 95%. Gen

avant-garde beauty up 270%, alongside adventure travel up 75% and
whimsical destinations like the Scottish Highlands up 465%. 

 INSTAGRAM IS GENERATING INACCURATE SEO BAIT FOR YOUR POSTS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Instagram is producing search-optimized headlines and descriptions
for public posts that appear in Google results without notifying
users. These headlines are created by Instagram and served only to
search bots, not to regular visitors. The practice has triggered
backlash from creators who say the tone and messaging contradict their
personal or brand identity. The generated content is distinct from
Instagram's accessibility-focused alt text and appears to be created
by a separate automated system.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE MOST IGNORED DATA IN MARKETING (SALES CALLS!) (4 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Most marketers ignore sales call transcripts even though about 75% of
startups record them, which makes this data a major untapped
advantage. This article shows how meeting transcripts paired with a
custom GPT create a qualitative engine that reveals intent patterns,
repeated questions, emotional shifts, and messaging gaps that SQL data
cannot surface. The setup requires collecting transcripts into a
single file, uploading it into a custom GPT, and adding detailed
behavior rules so the model can extract patterns and answer strategic
questions. This system becomes a long-term asset that can inform
messaging, coach sales teams, train AI tools, and scale qualitative
analysis without manual work. 

 STELLA ARTOIS TURNS GOOGLE MAPS REVIEWERS INTO BRAND AMBASSADORS (1
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stella Artois activated an unconventional campaign by targeting
Google Maps' Local Guides. The brand hosted top restaurant reviewers
at over 40 dining locations where Stella was served as part of the
meal. These guests organically posted photos and reviews, integrating
the beer into discovery experiences for future diners. With no option
for traditional ads on Google Maps, the strategy ensured Stella
appeared in highly trusted, user-generated content at key decision
points.

 USE CHATGPT AGENT MODE TO FIND CONTENT GAPS BETWEEN YOUR PAGE AND THE
AIO (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ChatGPT's Agent Mode can automate the process of comparing a page to
an AI Overview and quickly reveal content gaps. In a test on the topic
of ‘payroll tax vs income tax', it identified missing topics such as
flat vs. progressive rate structure, separate paycheck line items,
self-employment tax obligations, filing forms and responsibilities,
and coverage of income types. This helps an SEO avoid manual review
and speed up optimization work. 

 MARKETING LEADER 45 DAY PLAN (GOOGLE DRIVE) [12] 

 This folder contains a worksheet and checklist guide that helps
marketing leaders through their first 45 days to assess and influence
the GTM strategy. It starts with understanding the product, customer
needs, strengths, gaps, and competitive traps. Brand positioning,
customer advocacy, budget, systems, and revenue health are reviewed to
spot blockers. By day 45, findings are documented, cross-functional
alignment is secured, and a 6-month GTM plan is created. 

 FIND HIDDEN JOBS BEFORE THEY HIT LINKEDIN USING ATS SEARCHES (1
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Many open roles never appear on LinkedIn, especially at startups and
tech companies that post first on ATS platforms like Greenhouse,
Lever, Ashby, or Workable. Recruiters use X-ray searches to find
candidates, and job seekers can too. For example, search Google
directly: ‘site:jobs.ashbyhq.com "Growth Marketing" "Series A"
"Remote"' to uncover roles before they appear on LinkedIn. Customize
searches by title, location, industry, or keywords to find hidden
opportunities most applicants miss.

 YOUR DATA ISN'T PERSONAL ENOUGH FOR A WRAPPED EMAIL? (8 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Wrapped emails don't need personal data to be effective. The key is
presenting surprising or shareable stats that tell a story.
Highlighting top products, company milestones, and community
achievements makes customers feel part of the brand's success. Simple
visuals, playful comparisons, and a clear narrative keep the email
engaging and memorable. When done right, these emails validate
customer choices and create a sense of collective impact. 

 YOU'RE RUNNING THE WRONG TYPE OF CAB (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Customer Advisory Boards are often misused when one board is expected
to solve every problem for every audience. Strong CABs serve a
specific purpose, such as retaining executive relationships, gathering
product feedback, or hosting focused discussions. Companies should
start small, build for exclusivity, measure relationship depth, and
integrate CABs into a larger Customer-Led Growth system. CABs are one
pillar of customer strategy, not a replacement for community,
education, or lifecycle programs.
