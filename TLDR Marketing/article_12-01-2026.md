NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE: DON'T MAKE “BITE-SIZED” CONTENT FOR LLMS IF YOU CARE
ABOUT SEARCH RANK (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google is pushing back on the growing SEO practice of “content
chunking”. Breaking articles into ultra-short sections to appeal to
LLMs can hurt long-term search performance. Google representatives say
these tactics are based on false assumptions about how Gemini and
other AI systems influence rankings. Google does not reward bite-sized
formatting designed for bots, and continues to rely heavily on human
behavior signals like clicks and engagement to determine relevance. 

 7 DIGITAL MARKETING TRENDS TO WATCH FOR IN 2026 (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Short-form video dominates attention across platforms. AR glasses and
interactive experiences are becoming more common. Threads is growing
as a real-time discussion hub, while Reddit faces saturation, and
teen-focused apps are emerging. AI-generated content may reduce
sharing, and algorithm opt-outs could reshape engagement.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 5 PRICING IDEAS TO DRIVE UPGRADES (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Quarterly billing works better for products that require setup
because it filters for serious buyers and reduces early churn.
Removing seat limits and pricing on usage metrics increases adoption
and speeds monetization when collaboration drives value. Raising
prices across all plans while increasing entry tiers more, i.e., a
~27% increase vs. ~12% on higher tiers, pushes customers toward
upgrades. 

 GUIDE TO CREATOR-LED GROWTH: ZERO COST AND NO PITCHING (14 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Most companies ask creators to share content and get ignored. The
ones that win supply the benchmarks, frameworks, and original research
that creators need for their audiences. This give-first approach turns
brands into upstream sources that get cited without pitching, which
brings warmer leads, lower acquisition costs, and shorter sales
cycles. It works only with consistent value over months.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 QUERY FAN-OUT: WHAT 60,000+ SEARCHES FROM CHATGPT & GOOGLE SHOW
(WEBINAR) [10] 

 Chris Long (Nectiv) and Josh Spilker (AirOps) will discuss how LLMs
retrieve content from searches via fan outs and share real-world
examples of how content changes can increase LLM mentions and
citations in this free event on January 14 at 1 PM ET. 

 FREE N8N COURSE (59 MINUTE VIDEO) [11] 

 This course walks through how to build an LLM workflow, a
low-autonomy AI agent, and an autonomous agent from scratch using n8n,
a combined workflow automation and agent-building platform that can
handle use cases like competitor monitoring, chatbot-style assistants,
inbox workers, and multi-agent research systems.

 SHOULD LINKS BE UNDERLINED? IT'S WORTH A/B TESTING (4 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Underlining links improves usability and accessibility, even if it
affects visual appeal. Google's tests showed that removing underlines
reduced clicks, slowed interaction, and lowered revenue. Hover
underlines had little impact and were shipped for competitive reasons.
Details matter because hover states and larger targets can help
recognition, while color-only links hurt performance. Accessibility
standards warn against relying on color alone, since many users are
colorblind and hover cues fail on touch devices. 

 INSTAGRAM IS BETTING ON THE MOMENTUM, NOT THE REACTION (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Instagram argues that a “raw aesthetic” preserves authenticity,
but AI already mimics those cues through UGC generators and AI
influencers with large followings. As AI realism improves, audiences
are growing more skeptical. Surveys show discomfort and declining
trust in AI-generated content. 

 STREAMING WIDENS SPORTS MARKETING FIELD (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Streaming is expanding sports marketing reach by bringing in younger
viewers and boosting engagement beyond linear TV. Traditional
broadcasts still deliver scale, with football driving a 20% lift in
broadcast viewership and the Super Bowl reaching 127M viewers, but
streaming skews younger. On Tubi, 26.2% of Super Bowl viewers were 18
to 34. Sports documentaries add momentum, with viewing minutes rising
from 4.7B in 2021 to 16.9B in 2024.

clicks, or traffic volume.
