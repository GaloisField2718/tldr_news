 LTK: THE CMO'S CREATOR GUIDE 2026 (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Creator marketing is now the top area for 2026 investment, ahead of
AI-driven search, paid social, and gaming. 90% of brands use creators,
and 97% of CMOs plan to increase budgets. Brands are scaling
“creator armies” for always-on campaigns, with most working with
50+ creators. Creator content now spans display, CTV, content
marketing, and retail media. LTK reports 2.1x higher click growth and
1.4x higher sales growth for brands boosting creator content compared
to competitors. 

 MINI PRODUCTS ARE EVERYWHERE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Brands are releasing smaller versions of bags, snacks, and beauty
items to attract price-conscious Gen Z and millennial shoppers. Sales
of mini beauty products jumped 15% in H1 2025, nearly 4x faster than
full-size items. Minis work as trial purchases, social media-friendly
content, and impulse buys. Even tequila and spirits brands are getting
in on the trend, turning miniature bottles into “affordable
luxuries” that drive buzz.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO GET CITED IN AI ANSWERS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI search rewards consistent authority and authentic brand signals.
To increase visibility in AI answers, prioritize publishing
high-quality, expertise-driven content on your own site or in
respected industry publications. Another tactic is to actively
participate in conversations on platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn, and
niche forums to help AI models pick up real references. Beyond digital
efforts, offline tactics such as presenting at industry conferences,
collaborating with known influencers, and contributing data-backed
research studies create real-world credibility that AI systems can
pick up over time. 

 HOW ALDI REVAMPED ITS SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY — AND WHY IT'S WORKING
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Aldi has shifted its social media strategy to presenting itself as a
persona rather than a store. It's no longer focusing its socials on
low prices and instead leans into playful, culturally relevant content
and viral trends. This approach has driven double-digit growth in
engagement on Instagram and TikTok, with some posts reaching over
600,000 shares and far outperforming competitors like Kroger and Whole
Foods. Aldi's small social team, which consists of a manager and two
associates, achieved this by staying consistent across platforms while
balancing planned content with quick reactions to trends. 

 10 B2B NEWSLETTER TIPS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 B2B newsletters work best as short-form, native content that teaches
or inspires rather than just linking to blog posts. Send them
consistently, monthly or bi-monthly, and from a real person, not a
generic address. Avoid generic titles, focus on the reader, and keep
copy skimmable. Reserve pitches for the PS, use images or videos
sparingly, and publish on a newsletter platform for extra reach. Split
dense content across multiple issues to keep them readable and
engaging.

 WHAT 3 YEARS AT WIZ TAUGHT ME ABOUT B2B MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Wiz built its B2B brand by ignoring standard playbooks and adopting
high-frequency experimentation. The team launched projects such as a
toy store for CISOs and a Kubernetes course taught by puppies,
intentionally choosing ideas a traditional enterprise would avoid.
These “drops” helped differentiate Wiz in a crowded cybersecurity
market and fueled a 10X growth in organic reach. Rather than relying
on performance channels, it focused on unpaid attention. 

 PULL VS. PUSH MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Push marketing usually shows linear or diminishing returns and
requires sustained spend to maintain reach. Pull marketing, by
contrast, builds momentum over time but depends on audience discovery
and organic engagement. Push efforts can risk brand fatigue and
low-quality interactions when overused, while pull tactics may
underdeliver without a clear path to distribution.
