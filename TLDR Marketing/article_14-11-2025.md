NEWS & TRENDS

 MARK ZUCKERBERG WANTS ALL OF ADVERTISING. ANDY JASSY MAY HAVE A
STRONGER CLAIM (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Amazon appears to be in a stronger position than Meta to control more
of the advertising ecosystem due to its growing AI tools, unmatched
commerce signals, and major expansion into streaming TV. It claims it
can help brands reach 90% of the streaming market through its data
partnerships, and it has 80 million authenticated US households
feeding its targeting systems. Its new AI tools for creative,
planning, and campaign management suggest it could replace many
functions handled by agencies, even as some marketers question how
fast these tools will be adopted. Meta continues to push its own AI
vision, but Amazon's deeper footprint in TV, ad tech, and first-party
data gives it an advantage in this emerging battle. 

 WOMEN ARE DISCUSSING THEIR NEXT CAR PURCHASE ON REDDIT, IS YOUR BRAND
ON THE SHORTLIST? (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Half of Reddit's 185M weekly US users are now women, many planning
car purchases. Three in five expect to buy within two years, and one
in four within 6 to 12 months. Reddit is the top platform female car
buyers trust, with 68% preferring real people's insights over
comparison sites. Two-thirds want brands to share product details, and
many engage in auto and life-planning communities where intent is
high. Providing useful content and joining discussions through AMAs
and Conversation Ads helps brands connect with buyers as they decide.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ANALYZE WHAT CHATGPT USERS ARE ASKING USING YOUR WEBSITE'S BOT
TRAFFIC (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Analyzing server logs for ChatGPT-User bot visits can reveal what
topics real ChatGPT users are prompting about. This provides a
data-driven alternative to unreliable third-party prompt volume
estimates. Websites can identify which subjects attract the most
AI-driven attention by filtering logs for ChatGPT-User activity and
clustering pages by topic using LLMs or vector embeddings. Comparing
bot visits with human referral traffic highlights whether content is
informative but unengaging or blocked from bot access. 

 HOW THOUGHT LEADERSHIP ADS DRIVE PLG GROWTH ON LINKEDIN (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 About 80% of the LinkedIn budget goes to Thought Leadership ads that
drive strong PLG signups with minimal CTAs. Edited posts with clear
next steps and tested objectives perform best, with Engagement
outperforming Reach. Diverse voices, a creator engine, and persona
targeting keep content relevant, while frequent rotation prevents
fatigue. Next steps include adding visuals for brand recall and
featuring more employees, customers, and micro-influencers. 

 WINNING WITH PINTEREST ADS: HOW TO INCREASE YOUR B2C SALES (12 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Pinterest advertising presents a cost-effective alternative to Meta
and TikTok, especially for businesses targeting planners and DIY
consumers. Its visual search structure supports long-lived campaign
assets, enabling ongoing reach well beyond the paid window. Brands
should lead with high-performing offers, repurpose content with
Pinterest-specific formatting, and structure campaigns to guide users
from discovery to purchase. Strategic use of the Pinterest tag,
interest targeting, and act-alike audiences increases effectiveness
and creates retargeting opportunities.

[12]

comparisons, integration of shoppable insights in the Gemini app, and

 I JUST SPENT $20K ON BRANDING BECAUSE OF AI (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The rapid rise of AI has made it easier than ever to launch startups,
creating a “sea of sameness” that makes strong branding essential
for standing out. As automation takes over campaign optimization, ad
creative and brand identity have become the final competitive edge.
Founder-led content and authentic storytelling are now key to making
brands feel alive and credible in an AI-driven market. 

 ANTHROPOMEME (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 @superficialsharon, a commentator on absurdist humour on TikTok,
explores internet culture through deadpan observations on romance,
creativity, and social media anxiety. Her work traces a path from
early Instagram meme consumption to meta-ironic communities like
@bileboye and @still_on_a_downward_spiral, where hyper-specific humour
fosters belonging while reflecting online isolation. She shows how
irony and absurdity shape digital communities and create fleeting yet
meaningful connections. Her TikTok content channels this sensibility,
using humour to highlight human behaviour and the logic of online
spaces.
