STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO LAUNCH MORE A/B TESTS WITHOUT ENOUGH DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Launching at least 2 to 3 A/B tests per month enables you to increase
your website conversion rate and revenue much faster. One strategy is
to use the visual editor in your A/B testing tool to improve wording
and imagery. You can also use a platform like Upwork to find
individual A/B test developers. Alternatively, outsourcing the work to
an A/B test development agency is sometimes the right call. If the
development shortage isn‚Äôt improving, you‚Äôll need to work on
getting buy-in from senior management by proving the ROI and being
specific about what resources you need.

 3 QUESTIONS TO GAUGE IF YOU HAVE A MARKETABLE PRODUCT (1 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 A successful and marketable product solves a customer‚Äôs problem. To
gauge if your product is actually marketable, ask yourself how many
people are aware they have the problem being solved. Too often,
startups try to solve problems that people aren‚Äôt aware they have.
Next, ask how often the problem shows up. The more frequent the
problem shows up, the more likely someone will pay to solve it.
Finally, determine what the impact is of not solving the problem. If
nothing bad happens when the problem goes unsolved, it‚Äôs a signal
that no real market exists. Answering these questions helps you
understand your customers better and plan more effective marketing.
