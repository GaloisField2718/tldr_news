NEWS & TRENDS

 GEN ALPHA UNFILTERED: A DEEP DIVE INTO THE MINDS, VALUES, AND
BEHAVIORS OF THE YOUNGEST GENERATION (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gen Alpha are shaping culture early through strong influence on
family purchases and a growing sense of autonomy. They are spending
more time offline, favoring real-world activities and physical toys,
and showing greater interest in collaborative and creative gaming like
Roblox, which has doubled in use since 2021. Girls are aiming higher
in careers like law and medicine, but fewer boys believe they can do
anything, revealing a growing confidence gap. Social media use is
increasingly passive, with kids scrolling more and posting less, while
influencer marketing is overtaking traditional advertising, even for
food choices. Despite not holding the purse strings, many Gen Alpha
kids, especially 8-11-year-olds, have decision-making power and are
already active consumers, especially in ecommerce and virtual
spending. 

 HOW AND WHY TEENS USE AI COMPANIONS (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI companions on platforms like Character.AI, Replika, and CHAI have
created new digital social spaces where 72% of teens have tried them
for chatting, emotional support, role-playing, entertainment, and
advice. Teens use AI companions because they find them entertaining,
are curious about the technology, value their constant availability,
and appreciate the nonjudgmental interaction that lets them share
things they wouldn't tell friends or family. Many platforms allow easy
access for users as young as 13. However, one-third of teens report
feeling uncomfortable with AI responses.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 5 B2B SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGIES FOR SAAS LAUNCHES (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Gorgias team used 5 social tactics tailored for B2B to drive a
200% boost in engagement during launch week. They spotlighted the
people behind the product to humanize AI content, diversified post
formats with carousels, videos, and text to appeal to different
preferences, and created ready-to-use assets for employees to amplify
reach. They also lightly referenced trending content without relying
on it, and enforced a one-week, no-links-on-LinkedIn policy to
prioritize reach over immediate conversion. 

 HOW BRANDS CAN USE UNCERTAINTY TO CREATE RELEVANCE (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Due to a growing hunger for truth and confidence, consumers are
turning to brands that can offer credible guidance and emotional
support in a time of deep uncertainty. Traditional networks of trust,
like family, community, and journalism, have weakened, creating space
for AI to act as a surrogate source of authority, offering
recommendations that often sound empathetic and informed. This shift
raises the importance of consistent brand messaging across digital
environments, where large language models are shaping public
narratives based on the content they find.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 SKOOL (TOOL) [10] 

 Skool is a community and course platform similar to Facebook Groups
but built for creators and coaches who want a focused, ad-free space.
It combines discussion forums, course hosting, progress tracking, and
payments in one place, without relying on third-party tools. Members
can interact, learn, and engage without the distractions of social
media, making it ideal for those building paid or private communities.


 GOODBYE, FEATURED SNIPPETS: HOW SERP FEATURES HAVE EVOLVED IN THE AI
ERA (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI Overviews surged from 3.93% to 27.43% visibility between January
and June, while Featured snippets dropped from 15.41% to 5.53%.
Sitelinks saw the largest gain, rising from 8.44% to 84.95%, likely
due to changes in how Google displays Scroll-to Sitelinks. Other
features that declined sharply include Shopping, Paid results, and
Paid Sitelinks, all dropping more than 50%. Knowledge Cards, AI
Overview Sitelinks, and Question SERP features also increased in
visibility, though less dramatically. 

 INSTAGRAM TESTS FRAME-SPECIFIC LIKE COUNTS FOR CAROUSEL POSTS (1
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Instagram is testing a feature that shows like counts for each
individual frame in a carousel post. The likes are tied to the frame
visible when the user taps the like button, offering more detailed
engagement insights, though not guaranteed to reflect frame-specific
intent. This update follows Instagram's ongoing focus on carousels,
which tend to outperform single-image posts due to higher interaction
and resurfacing by the algorithm.

 GRAB YOUR POPCORN: HOW MOVIE FANDOM IMPACTS BUYING BEHAVIOR (5 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Movie fandom influences buying behavior by creating emotional
connections that last beyond the initial viewing. Amazon Ads and Crowd
DNA identified 5 stages of engagement, from pre-release excitement to
long-term community involvement, giving brands multiple points to
connect with fans. Theatergoers seek immersive experiences, while
at-home viewers value comfort and nostalgia, often pairing movies with
food and related products. 

 HOW KRAFT HEINZ LEANS INTO CULTURE TO CREATE MARKETING WINS (2 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Kraft Heinz stands out by hijacking cultural moments. It partners
with figures like music producer Mustard, parodies events like the
Indy 500 with hot dog cars, and generates billions of earned
impressions. The company taps into brand, cultural, and consumer
truths to fuel creative ideas, prioritizing organic engagement and
fast, iterative collaboration. By listening to consumers and reacting
quickly, such as with A1's meme or Jet-Puffed's egg carton packaging,
it drives both conversation and product sellouts.
