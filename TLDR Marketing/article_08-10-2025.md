 YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA RESOLUTION FOR 2026: POST LESS, ENGAGE MORE
(SPONSOR) [4]

(!) higher engagement.

including:

 	* Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X breakdowns
 	* A deeper look at video's rising dominance
 	* The quality-over-quantity benefit analysis
 	* Real-world brand spotlights

NEWS & TRENDS

 DUOLINGO ROLLS OUT CHARACTER-LED ADS PLATFORM TO CHARM GEN Z (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Duolingo's new advertising product allows brands to run
mobile-optimized ads featuring its well-known cast of characters. The
company reports that the ads are structured to align with the app's
tone and user behavior. The initiative aims to engage and monetize its
Gen Z audiences while maintaining user retention and supporting the
platform's free education model. 

 HOW SOCIAL MEDIA GIVES TV A SECOND LIFE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Social media has turned TV shows into cultural ecosystems that live
beyond the screen. Gen Z and Millennials now experience TV through
TikToks, memes, and online commentary rather than full episodes,
making conversation the real content. For broadcasters and brands,
this means treating social as a core storytelling format and creating
social-first, community-driven narratives that extend a show's impact.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CONTENT AS A SERVICE (CAAS): THE FRAMEWORK THAT ALIGNS MARKETING WITH
THE BUSINESS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The “CaaS” framework treats content as a business function rather
than a production line. Each asset serves an internal client, such as
Sales or Customer Success, with clear goals and metrics tied to
business outcomes. Teams prioritize by impact, use intake briefs for
alignment, and measure results through data and qualitative proof. The
approach replaces busywork with strategy, making content teams
accountable for growth instead of output. 

 THE $5,000 LINKEDIN COMPETITION THAT TURNED OUR TEAM INTO BRAND
AMBASSADORS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Storyarb ran a 10-week LinkedIn competition for employees. 14
participants generated over 7M impressions, boosted website traffic by
55%, grew LinkedIn followers by 54%, and influenced sales
conversations. The program succeeded by combining financial
incentives, gamification, and training on posting skills, hooks, and
content strategy. Employees shared posts about topics they were
passionate about and turned advocacy into a marketing and recruitment
tool.

 RUNDOWN OF THE "AGENTIC COMMERCE PROTOCOL" FOR CHATGPT'S INSTANT
CHECKOUT (2 MINUTE READ) [12]

ChatGPT's Instant Checkout. Similar to Google's product feeds, the
protocol allows merchants to provide structured feeds to OpenAI to
give more data about their products. There are 9 fields that
e-commerce merchants should input and optimize, including title,

 IOS 26 EXPLAINED: WHAT APPLE'S NEW UPDATE MEANS FOR EMAIL & SMS
MARKETERS (32 MINUTE VIDEO) [13] 

 This podcast explains Apple's iOS 26 update and its impact on email,
SMS, and web tracking. Link tracking, device signals, and open rates
are now less reliable, and SMS messages may land in “Unknown
Senders”. It covers attribution challenges, KPI shifts, and
multi-channel strategies, while offering tactical fixes like
server-side tracking, two-tap opt-ins, and lifecycle flow adjustments
to maintain performance.

 THE ART OF DESTINATION MAKING (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Branding a place into a global destination requires a clear identity,
accessible infrastructure, and consistent buzz. Iceland and Banff
succeeded by defining unique icons, improving access, and creating
shareable moments that drove global attention. Iceland tripled its
annual tourism within a decade after launching its “Inspired by
Iceland” campaign and expanding airline stopover programs, while
Banff became Canada's most visited national park through strategic
marketing and infrastructure investment. Saudi Arabia's $800 billion
plan covers buzz and infrastructure but lacks a defining icon or
promise, which could limit its ability to stand out among destinations
like Dubai and Las Vegas. 

 VENT NOW VS VENT AI: WHO WINS? (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This piece compares two AI therapy apps, Vent AI and Vent Now. It
shows how Vent Now quickly overtook its rival through aggressive
social tactics. While Vent AI relies on paid ambassadors and
low-performing videos, Vent Now floods TikTok with thousands of
similar slideshow posts using viral hooks about detachment and mental
health, likely generated with AI tools. This formulaic, low-cost
strategy has driven massive engagement and revenue, proving that
efficiency and volume now outperform authenticity in the AI wellness
app race. 

 FREE OR PAID SUBSCRIPTION? FOR ONLINE PLATFORMS, IT'S A DANCE (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Research shows that the choice between free, paid, or hybrid models
on digital platforms is less about pricing pressure and more about the
strength of network effects and the commercial value of user data
captured. When platforms like Meta or Google can collect detailed
behavioral data and depend heavily on network-driven features, the
free model is the most profitable. Subscription models become more
viable when data is less valuable or network effects are weaker, as
seen with streaming services like Netflix or Spotify. The study also
finds that hybrid models, while seemingly flexible, can intensify
competition by placing platforms in direct overlap for all users. This
structure can reduce margins and open markets to new entrants.
