NEWS & TRENDS

 FOURTEEN AGS SUE TIKTOK, ACCUSING IT OF HARMING CHILDREN'S MENTAL
HEALTH (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 14 attorneys general, led by officials in New York and California,
have filed lawsuits against TikTok. They are accusing the platform of
affecting the mental health of young users and collecting data from
minors without parental consent. The lawsuits contend that TikTok
misleads users about its safety, focusing on addictive features such
as persistent notifications and autoplay videos, as well as risky
challenges. TikTok has denied the claims. 

 A GOOGLE BREAKUP IS ON THE TABLE, SAY DOJ LAWYERS (2 MINUTE READ) [5]


 The Department of Justice is proposing remedies after a ruling that
Google is a monopolist, suggesting potential divestitures like selling
Chrome, Android, or Google Play. Its filing highlights Google's
control over search distribution and the payments it makes to secure
default status on platforms like Apple's iPhone. These payments, it
argues, create barriers for rivals to compete in distribution
channels.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WIN REPORT: HOW A SIMPLIFIED SIGN-UP FLOW INCREASED CONVERSIONS BY
12% (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mobbin increased conversions by 12% by consolidating and optimizing
its sign-up process. Redirecting users from an initial modal to a
dedicated sign-up page, with improved headlines and messaging,
simplified the user journey and addressed key objections.
Consolidating these two user journeys also made future testing easier
by allowing tests to reach statistical significance faster. 

 HAVE WRITER'S BLOCK? DELETE YOUR DRAFTS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A study of jazz guitarists in 2023 found that better improvisation
comes from automatic, unconscious brain processes, not overthinking.
This insight supports the idea that deleting drafts can free up
creativity, allowing creators to take risks and move beyond
perfectionism. Rediscover creative freedom by discarding drafts and
letting go of audience expectations.

 CAN FACEBOOK WIN BACK GEN Z? (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Facebook's redesign emphasizes features like Marketplace, Groups, and
a TikTok-style "Explore" page to regain Gen Z users. Its outdated
reputation and political controversies had driven the demographic
away. Gen Z prefers video-centric apps like Instagram, Snapchat, and
YouTube over text-heavy platforms like Facebook and X. While
Marketplace remains popular, Facebook's core purpose of connecting
with friends is less relevant as Gen Z engagement declines. 

 YOUTUBE SHORTS JUST GOT MUCH EASIER FOR BRANDS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 YouTube Shorts' new 3-minute limit allows brands to easily repurpose
content from Instagram Reels and TikTok. With all three platforms
supporting up to 90-second videos, brands can maximize reach by
sharing the same content across them. There is no need for
platform-specific content as users behave similarly on each. Treat
platforms as distribution channels and post the same videos on all
major social networks. 

 THE U.S. NAVY IS LOOKING FOR SUBMARINE RECRUITS ON REDDIT (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The U.S. Navy has launched an interactive recruitment campaign on
Reddit called "Sub Reddit Hunt" to attract potential recruits for its
submarine crews. The campaign involves users solving puzzles and
deciphering clues to find hidden submarines. This approach is part of
broader efforts by the Navy to boost recruitment, which has been
challenging due to factors like a strong job market and stricter
enlistment requirements. The Navy and other military branches have
increasingly turned to digital platforms and gaming to engage younger
audiences.
