 YOUTUBE'S GLOBAL CULTURE & TRENDS REPORT (29 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Fans are no longer just consuming content. They're actively shaping
digital media by creating trends that propel moments into global
phenomena. Examining end-of-year lists across 12 countries, this
report identifies common themes, like an animated series turned
franchise and a sports moment amplified online. These findings reflect
a shift toward participatory, fan-led pop culture, with YouTube acting
as a hub for collective cultural experiences. 

 DEMOGS ARE DEAD, MINDSETS ARE MASSIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Demographic data, like age and generation, is losing relevance.
Psychographics - values, mindsets, and motivations - are becoming more
important. AI tools now allow marketers to quickly access
psychographic data. By focusing on mindsets, brands can predict future
behavior. They can also communicate more effectively across age
groups.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHEN TO USE EMOTIONAL VS INFORMATIONAL ADS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Research using fMRI scans reveals that emotional ads work best for
pleasurable products, while informative ads are more effective for
functional products. Ads for pleasurable products, such as vacations
or chocolate, stimulate brain areas tied to reward and memory,
increasing emotional engagement and interest. Ads for practical
products, like cleaning supplies, activate brain regions linked to
analytical thinking, encouraging practical decision-making. Brain scan
data improved ad success prediction by 9.1% to 18.1% compared to
self-reports. Limitations of the research include a small sample size,
testing only headphone ads, and not exploring mixed messaging. 

 TURN YOUR CUSTOMER DATA INTO RETENTION GOLD: A QUICK GUIDE TO
POST-PURCHASE SURVEYS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 32% of brands actively use post-purchase surveys to shape marketing
strategies, leaving a wealth of insights untapped. By asking targeted
questions like “Did you buy this as a gift?” brands can
personalize the customer experience, refine audience segmentation, and
improve campaign relevance. 

 A DINNER PLAYBOOK (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Host a cost-effective, pipeline-driving dinner by selecting a city
where your ICPs are located. Build a guest list through LinkedIn,
investors, and tools like Apollo, and send FOMO-inducing invites.
Choose an impressive venue, plan seating near key stakeholders, and
spark engaging conversations with introductions and marketing
insights. Capture high-quality photos to share in follow-ups,
encouraging social media posts for added visibility. Follow up
thoughtfully by referencing discussions and offering tailored value.

 HOW BRANDS SHOULD RESPOND WHEN SPOTIFY WRAPPED DROPS (1 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Brands responding to Spotify Wrapped memes should act fast and
publish within 12 hours. Overly product-centric posts risk losing
creative impact due to leadership interference. Delayed posts (5+
days) often indicate slow approval processes or limited resources,
while no response may reflect resource constraints or strategic
restraint. Parodying the trend or humorously acknowledging resource
limitations can also work in a brand's favor. 

 MAKE THEM LAUGH, SELL THEM STUFF (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Humorous ads increase engagement, with campaigns like Old Spice's
"The Man Your Man Could Smell Like", GEICO's “Hump Day”, and
Snickers' "You're Not You When You're Hungry" showing great results.
Effective humor must align with brand identity and resonate with
audience preferences, avoiding controversial topics. Successful
campaigns often use relatable scenarios, exaggeration, and precise
timing to create memorable and shareable content. It is also key to
test humor pre-launch to avoid offending people.
