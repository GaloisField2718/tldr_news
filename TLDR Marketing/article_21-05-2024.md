 MARKETING BUDGETS ARE DOWN 15% YOY (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Marketing budgets aren't what they used to be. They're down 15% from
2023 to 2024 on average in the US and Europe. Search advertising
represented the largest mean percentage of digital channel budgets,
followed by social, digital display, and SEO. As for offline channel
budgets, event marketing had the highest mean percentage, followed by
sponsorships and linear TV. Over 75% of CMOs say that Gen AI is an
investment priority for this year and expect it to eliminate costly
drudge work and solve productivity challenges due to shrinking
budgets. 

 HOW SELL-SIDE CURATION IS RESHAPING THE POST-COOKIE SUPPLY CHAIN (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The phasing out of third-party cookies is driving the adoption of
sell-side curation, where supply-side platforms use first-party data
to create targeted audience segments for advertisers. This development
is transforming the ad tech landscape by reducing demand-side
platforms' dominance in audience curation and increasing the strategic
importance of supply-side platforms and data management platforms.

 5 TACTICS FOR BETTER ONBOARDING (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The initial onboarding experience for users is frequently overlooked
as a one-time checklist. This often becomes stale as products,
messaging, and GTM tactics evolve. To reduce friction and accelerate
time-to-value, set up reverse trials directly into the highest-tier
plan, use social proof throughout the onboarding flow, push for team
usage, and create action-triggered onboarding emails. 

 HOW TO SELL LIKE APPLE: THE OUTRAGEOUS POWER OF A MINIATURE STORY (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 We don't notice we're being sold to when we read a good sales story.
We pay attention to the story, and that's what makes a product seem
more valuable. This author breaks down an effective sales story that
Apple published on the sales page for the iPhone 13 Pro. The opening
sentence arouses curiosity and promises readers they'll learn
something. The story then effectively combines technical language and
a description of Hollywood cinematographers to sell readers on a more
creative life ‚Äî which in effect sells the product.

 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRODUCT VS. BRAND DIFFERENTIATION (5 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The trouble with product differentiation is that every unique
ingredient or feature will be copied. However, a truly authentic and
consistent brand identity cannot be copied. This allows brands like
Liquid Death to succeed, despite selling a commodity. Companies should
invest in brand differentiation by establishing their category and
also what they're selling. If you must have product differentiation,
do it in multiple ways to make it more defensible. 

 THE 4 LEVELS OF MARKETING SOPHISTICATION (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This piece highlights a case study from Kraft's Cheese & Dairy unit,
illustrating how it crafted a category growth strategy across diverse
brands. It identifies 4 levels of marketing sophistication: marketing
as a cost center, brand building and pricing power, product and
business model innovation, and driving marketing capitalization.
Price-slashing Philadelphia would've wrecked the cheese's premium
status. Cost-cutting on Velveeta would've been a massive opportunity
cost. Each Kraft brand required tailored strategies based on their
market positions and consumer dynamics.
