NEWS & TRENDS

 FROM MCDONALD'S TO KELLOGG'S: WHY ARE SO MANY BRANDS DITCHING THEIR
LOGO? (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Kellogg's new campaign shows the power of typography over logos. This
reflects a trend where 83% of designers prioritize type in branding.
Typography-led branding, driven by digital-first strategies and
democratized design tools, is not a passing trend. It offers immediate
brand recognition and clarity. McDonald's, British Airways, and
easyJet show that a strong typeface can be as impactful as a logo. For
lasting brand identity, a well-crafted typeface communicates
authenticity, emotion, and cultural resonance. 

 WHAT LUSH LEARNED FROM THREE YEARS OF BEING MOSTLY OFFLINE (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Lush's decision to step away from social media in 2021 led the brand
to focus on building its owned channels. Its email newsletter and app
now boast millions of subscribers. While still active on YouTube,
LinkedIn, and Pinterest, Lush has embraced affiliate marketing and
local engagement strategies. The brand's move, once seen as radical,
has gained more understanding, with Jack Constantine urging other
brands to invest in their own platforms instead of relying on
third-party social media.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 15 TIPS TO BOOST CTR FOR SEARCH ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google is changing Responsive Search Ads by allowing headlines to
replace descriptions and sitelinks, making ad testing harder. To
improve CTR, include keywords in headlines and descriptions, use clear
CTAs, highlight customer benefits, and add ad extensions. Leverage
psychological triggers like urgency, scarcity, and social proof while
keeping messaging simple and focused. Test different lengths, use
strong USPs, and always write for customers, not just for Google. 

 THE #1 PLACE FOR STARTUP BRANDS TO FIND TRACTION? OTHER PEOPLE'S
BRANDS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Partner marketing expands brand presence by leveraging larger
ecosystems for credibility, trust, and seamless adoption. Listing in
app stores like Shopify's or Notion's reshapes perception by
associating products with established platforms. These integrations
also improve user experience and drive growth by making adoption
easier.

 Microsoft is testing "Copilot Search", an AI-driven feature for Bing

 YOUTUBE WANTS TO LOOK A LITTLE MORE LIKE NETFLIX...NETFLIX FEELS THE
SAME (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 YouTube is launching a cheaper, ad-free subscription tier called
"Premium Lite" in select markets. It's offering users a way to enjoy
most content without ads for a lower price. Meanwhile, Netflix, which
previously avoided ads, introduced an ad-supported plan in 2022 to
recover from subscriber losses and now sees over 55% of new sign-ups
in ad-supported regions. While YouTube is shifting further toward
subscriptions, Netflix is working to grow its ad revenue.

experiences that align with consumers' passions. Through its Priceless
platform, the brand fosters deeper connections across 9 key areas,

 7 (NEW) LAWS FOR CONTENT MARKETING SUCCESS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Content marketing must be treated as a business, not a side project.
Stop seeking buy-in and integrate content directly into marketing.
Build owned media with multiple revenue streams, acquire or partner
with existing audiences, and create structured, scalable content
operations. Own your audience through first-party data and interactive
experiences. Prioritize a few standout content initiatives instead of
spreading efforts too thin. In 2030, the most successful brands will
be those that treat content as a strategic asset, not just another
marketing tactic.
