STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SEE GOOGLE'S "NEXT CHOICE" FOR A FEATURED SNIPPET (1 MINUTE READ) [6]


 When trying to optimize for a featured snippet in Google Search
results, it's helpful to be able to see the site that's "next in
line." You can understand what types of descriptions Google is pulling
into the snippet and also see if your site is being considered for
snippet inclusion. To achieve this, add a simple query operator to
exclude the domain that's currently winning the featured snippet. 

 "LOW INTENT MATCH" METHOD FOR SEO (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Marketers can employ the "Low Intent Match" method to identify search
queries with unmet needs. This involves focusing on search intent
where existing top content falls short, such as broad guides ranking
for specific tools queries. By creating targeted content like "49 Best
Voice of Customer Tools," they can better fulfill the exact need. The
process includes deep manual keyword research, clustering keywords by
SERP similarity, and analyzing groups for intent mismatches. This
strategy can help content to rank quickly and draw significant
traffic, even outranking major competitors.

 HOW CLICKUP BLENDS PLG AND SALES-ASSIST (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In this interview, ClickUp's COO shares how a hybrid approach of PLG
and sales-assist can lead to improved growth metrics and a 50%
reduction in CAC payback. ClickUp aligns its teams across growth,

key pillars behind its strategy and its journey to successful growth. 

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE LABOR ILLUSION (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Labor Illusion explains why people may value something more when
they think it takes a lot of effort. For example, a study found that
homebuyers rated apartments 36% better if they'd been told a real
estate agent had spent 9 hours researching, compared to a group told
that their agent spent 1 hour. Brands can use this psychological
principle by telling prospects in ads how much work went into the
product, showing the thought process behind outcomes in product
descriptions, or copying the scarcity and exclusivity in Hermes'
buying process. 

 MASTERING FLOOR PRICING: THE KEY TO OPTIMIZING YOUR PROGRAMMATIC AD
REVENUE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Scott Kolb, co-founder of Longitude Ads, discusses the importance of
setting effective price floors in programmatic advertising to maximize
ad revenue. He explains the need for adaptive flooring strategies that
are tightly integrated with a publisher's wrapper to dynamically
adjust floor prices based on real-time bidder behavior. Standalone
flooring tools often fail to account for all variables during user
sessions, leading to inefficiencies. Kolb provides examples of
significant revenue increases when adaptive flooring strategies are
correctly implemented, such as a sports media website experiencing a
76% RPM lift during March Madness.
