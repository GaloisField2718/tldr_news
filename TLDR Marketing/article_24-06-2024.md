NEWS & TRENDS

 ONLINE SHOPPERS ARE SHIFTING HABITS IN THE FACE OF INFLATION (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nearly 61% of respondents to a new survey said they had changed their
online shopping habits in response to higher prices, hinting at the
long-term impacts of inflation. Almost 90% of respondents said their
cost of living has gone up over the past 5 years. About half of
respondents said that they've considered stacking multiple coupons or
reselling highly desired products. Among the factors that persuade
online shoppers to buy from a certain brand are free shipping (63%),
affordable goods (61%), frequent sales (36%), free and straightforward
returns (34%), and loyalty incentives (33%). 

 LONG-FORM VIDEO'S UNEXPECTED COMEBACK: WHY 26+ SECONDS IS THE NEW
SWEET SPOT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Contrary to the belief that modern audiences have shorter attention
spans, videos ranging from 13 seconds to over 26 seconds performed
well on Instagram and TikTok in 2023. New research from Emplifi shows
that Instagram Reels and TikTok videos remain key drivers of brand
engagement. While Instagram leads in median video views, TikTok has
been closing the gap, indicating that audiences on both platforms are
receptive to longer content. 

 HOW SEARCH MARKETERS CAN KEEP UP WITH GEN Z (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Traditional search engines are losing relevance, with users
preferring personalized recommendations from social media and other
platforms. Gen Z in particular seeks trustworthy, curated shopping
experiences and is wary of AI and influencer-driven information.
Reddit is considered a highly trustworthy source, often on par with
recommendations from friends and family. The platform offers ad tools
that help brands place their products in relevant subreddit streams,
capitalizing on its role as a discovery tool.

 GOOGLE TURNS OFF UNIVERSAL ANALYTICS JULY 1: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google's Universal Analytics officially shuts down on July 1, at
which point all data will be deleted. Businesses that rely on
Universal Analytics for website measurement and data analysis need to
act quickly to avoid losing access to their historical data and
maintain continuity in their analytics capabilities. Prior to July 1,
website owners should export Universal Analytics data, set up and
configure a Google Analytics 4 property, migrate Google Ads links, and
create new conversions based on GA4 events. 

 TIKTOK LAUNCHES NEW IMAGE SHARING APP CALLED WHEE (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 TikTok has quietly launched Whee, a new image-sharing app designed
for close friends to share spontaneous moments. It resembles Instagram
but with a focus on private sharing. This comes shortly after the
company released Notes, another photo-sharing app that targets broader
audiences with lifestyle content. With Whee and Notes, TikTok is
likely aiming to tap into private sharing trends and expand its
eCommerce opportunities.

 THE MAGICAL DOT: THE GREATEST MARKETING IDEA THAT NEVER WORKED (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The "Magical Dot" involves placing a notification-like red dot next
to website menu items to boost click-through rates. Tremor.so tried it
and initially reported a 41% increase in CTR. However, deeper analysis
revealed that while clicks increased, conversions and revenue remained
unchanged. This highlights the importance of scrutinizing viral
marketing ideas for real impact, rather than being swayed by
impressive but superficial metrics. 

 SENTIMENT ANALYSIS EXAMPLES: HOW MARKETERS ARE UNLOCKING CONSUMER
INSIGHTS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Analyzing product-specific trends in consumer perception helps inform
future product releases. Performing risk assessments ahead of
campaigns can also prevent potential issues and ensure successful
launches. Identifying customer experience opportunities through
sentiment analysis of social messages and reviews provides a holistic
view of feedback.
