NEWS & TRENDS

 5 YEARS AFTER PANDEMIC LOCKDOWNS, IS RETAIL BACK TO NORMAL? (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The pandemic reshaped consumer behavior, with many diverting spending
to experiences and bringing new expectations to retail. Retailers
struggled initially but are now adapting to meet demands for better
in-store experiences. Consumer power has returned stronger than
before. However, inflation, tariffs, and economic uncertainty have
kept sentiment low, with confidence dropping 22% since December. 

 GOOGLE SAYS ITS EUROPEAN 'EXPERIMENT' SHOWS NEWS IS WORTHLESS TO ITS
AD BUSINESS (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In November, Google said it would conduct a test in 8 European
countries that would omit results from EU-based news publishers for a
small percentage of users. The company is now reporting that the news
has no meaningful monetary value for the company. Google saw no change
in ad revenue and only a 0.8% drop in usage. European copyright law
says the company must pay publishers for using snippets from articles,
but Google will likely use these results to try to limit news outlets'
negotiating leverage.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY BRAND-OWNED COMMUNITIES ARE THE FUTURE OF GROWTH (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Audience on third-party platforms doesn't translate to ownership, as
brands are constrained by platform rules, limited access to user data,
and the constant threat of reduced visibility or account issues. By
shifting to owned communities, brands gain full control of engagement,
enable peer-to-peer interaction, and build resilient, high-retention
spaces. This approach has been adopted by brands like Gymshark, YETI,
and Jeep to drive loyalty and lower CAC. 

 THE HERO PRODUCT STRATEGY ON GOOGLE ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Top-performing products often go under-leveraged in ad accounts
because marketers focus on volume rather than efficiency metrics. The
hero product strategy flips this by prioritizing products that deliver
the best return per click based on conversion rate, margin, and ad
engagement. Once identified, these products are pulled into isolated
campaigns with specific keyword targeting, custom ad creative, and
remarketing flows to drive both acquisition and retention more
efficiently than broad catalog strategies.

 CEOS RATE CMOS HIGHLY, BUT VIEW MARKETING MORE SKEPTICALLY (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Boathouse surveyed 150 CEOs and found that 24% gave their CMOs an A,
while 71% gave As or Bs. Concerns remain about trust and alignment
between CMOs and marketing overall. CMOs improved in soft skills, with
65% of CEOs saying they understand business goals and 61% calling them
performance-minded. However, 49% of CEOs said CMOs are “on the
periphery” of growth strategy, and grades dropped in areas like
trust with the C-suite and driving innovation. 

 “LEARN MORE” IS NOT A CTA (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Vague CTAs like “Learn More” and “Start Now” don't drive
meaningful conversions. Strong CTAs reduce friction by solving a
problem, feeling intuitive, and clearly guiding the next step. For
example, “Compare Pricing Options” is clearer than “See
Plans,” and “Test Your Skill Level for Free” is more compelling
than “Start Now.”
