TLDR MARKETING 2025-08-18

 THE DATA IS IN: YOU SHOULD BE POSTING LESS. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Remember those “best practice” blogs that told you to post 10x on
every social channel?

Good news: they've just been debunked.

Sprout Social analyzed 3 billion messages [5] across Facebook,
Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and X…

Turns out, posting less _drives better results_ - including up to 20%
(!) higher engagement.

The 2025 Content Benchmarks Report [5] reveals what actually worked in
2024: Reels (up 3%), community engagement (response rates matter more
than posts), and original content (not trend-chasing).

Time to get off the content hamster wheel… 🐹

See the full data + industry benchmarks to see how your engagement
rate compares.

NEWS & TRENDS

 SOCIAL MEDIA ADS PASSING AS POSTS: HOW ADVERTISING SLIPS INTO
INSTAGRAM (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Instagram users routinely underestimate how many ads appear in their
feeds as platforms are designing promotions to blend with organic
posts. In tests with 152 participants, nearly one-third of posts were
ads, yet most failed to notice the volume. Users engaged with the
content at rates similar to organic posts when advertising cues like
“Buy Now” buttons or logos were subtle. The findings show how
banner blindness has evolved into seamless ad absorption. 

 AS PUBLISHERS FACE SEARCH HEADWINDS, CREATORS GAIN AFFILIATE SPEND (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Publishers that built affiliate revenue on SEO face mounting pressure
as search platforms shift toward zero-click results and lower
commission structures. Amazon now pays creators baseline rates of
10-15% while publishers receive only 2-3%, widening the economic gap.
As a result, marketers are allocating incremental budgets to creators
who deliver higher engagement and measurable sales impact.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DO THIS INSTEAD OF LAUNCHING A BLOG (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Instead of starting with a blog, begin with LinkedIn posts to
leverage built-in distribution and test what resonates with your
target audience. Publish 30 posts over a month, identify the top 3
that connect, expand them into 800 to 1200-word newsletters, and then
scale the best ones into longer blog posts. This approach validates
ideas early and ensures content resonates before investing in larger
formats. 

 CLAY'S HACKATHON PLAYBOOK (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Clay uses customer hackathons as a growth engine. It runs 20-30 per
quarter, driving expansions up to 5X and viral LinkedIn content.
Targeting customers 3-6 months in, the sessions help build advanced
workflows with real business impact. They generate authentic video
content that fuels inbound demand and retention, while also serving as
R&D labs where engineers test features, creating a flywheel of
adoption, marketing, and discovery.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 WHAT'S A GOOD CONVERSION RATE? (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A good benchmark for landing page performance is an overall median
conversion rate of 6.6%, though results depend heavily on industry.
Ecommerce and SaaS pages typically convert around 4% at the median,
but strong campaigns can achieve nearly 3X that rate. Professional
services and financial services outperform the average with medians
above 6% and 8% respectively, while the travel and hospitality sector
can climb past 15% at the high end. Entertainment campaigns stand out
with average conversion rates above 12%. 

 UNIFIED CTV: THE POWER OF BROADCASTER CONTENT (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Brainlabs tested adding Broadcaster YouTube content to a Unified CTV
campaign with Netflix and YouTube during the Women's Euros. The
campaign reached 1.4M additional people without extra budget,
achieving 142% of planned reach at the same cost. It drove a 77% lift
in product search and 61% in brand search, capturing engagement spikes
after key matches. Brand-safe content like highlights and interviews
extended audience attention, showing that combining Broadcaster
YouTube with Unified CTV improves reach, frequency, and performance in
a fragmented market.

 18 QUESTIONS TO UNDERSTAND YOUR BUYERS' DECISIONS (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 To understand your buyers, focus on why they purchase, what solution
they want, and how their organization makes decisions. Ask about
motivations, desired outcomes, and required features. Also consider
approval steps, budget, timing, and compliance needs. Together, these
insights give a clear view of the buying journey and help avoid vague
assumptions. 

 SELLING ON AMAZON BOOSTS YOUR DIRECT SALES TOO (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Selling on online marketplaces is a cost effective way for small or
new brands to acquire customers and drive direct website sales.
Research found that every 71 sales on a marketplace led to one
customer switching to the brand's website. Customer acquisition costs
were lower on marketplaces compared to owned websites. Brands can use
marketplaces to gain visibility and then encourage repeat buyers to
purchase directly by offering unique products, benefits, or promotions
on their own sites.
