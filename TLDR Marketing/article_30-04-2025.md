NEWS & TRENDS

 STUDY SHOWS AI BOTS ARE MORE PERSUASIVE THAN HUMANS IN DIVISIVE
DEBATE (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AI bots on Reddit were found to be 3-6X more persuasive than humans
in divisive debates. The bots' ability to sway opinions without users
knowing raises concerns about the future of digital interaction. As
platforms like Meta roll out AI personas, internal staff have flagged
ethical risks, especially around bots engaging in romantic or explicit
chats. The rush to deploy these tools could have long-term social
consequences. 

 WHY CRM 3.0 IS COMING - AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR COMMERCE MARKETING (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CRM 3.0 is transforming commerce marketing by integrating data, AI,
and storytelling to deliver hyper-personalized experiences. Retail and
commerce media are gaining prominence, fueled by first-party data and
AI's role in enhancing personalization and media planning. However,
measurement remains a challenge. Traditional media must adapt to stay
competitive, as CRM, media, and commerce converge. The future of
marketing will focus on full-funnel strategies, creative storytelling,
and stronger control over data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AHREFS' RADICAL GENEROSITY ENGINE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ahrefs drives growth through a strategy of radical generosity,
offering valuable content, tools, and a genuinely useful free tier.
Its media properties, which include a YouTube channel with over
620,000 subscribers and a research-driven blog, focus on education
rather than direct product promotion. Instead of traditional lead
magnets, Ahrefs provides free, fully functional tools that deliver
real value and build trust. Its free tier product, Ahrefs Webmaster
Tools, is permanently useful and creates long-term goodwill, leading
to organic product adoption over time. 

 MAKE YOUR CHATBOT USE INTERJECTIONS (OH WOW!) (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chatbots that use interjections like “Aww,” “Oh,” or
“Wow” are perceived as more human and lead to better customer
experiences. In four experiments, such chatbots increased user
satisfaction by 49.7%, improved perceived performance by 8.2%, and
made users feel 17.5% more understood. Even in negative situations,
people were 54.8% more likely to keep shopping with the company. The
effect works because interjections mimic human emotional cues, which
helps users feel listened to and more engaged.

 Meta's new app, powered by its latest Llama 4 model, enables users to

 CONSUMER PRICING ISN'T THE ONLY CASUALTY OF TARIFFS (3 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Tariffs don't just raise prices, they often stop innovation before
products ever reach shelves. This post shares how a promising diffuser
project at Newell Brands was shelved due to a 25% tariff, even with
strong demand and research behind it. Protectionist policies can limit
creativity and stall momentum, forcing brands to quietly abandon good
ideas. The impact is often invisible but significant, affecting
choices, strategy, and the trust consumers place in a brand. 

 PR DISASTERS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED: LESSONS FROM HIGH-PROFILE
FAILURES (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 PR issues at Nike, Ulta, and Netflix show how even well-known brands
can lose control of the narrative through bad communication. Nike's
2025 marathon ad campaign, which presented a simplistic,
commercialized take on marathoners' complex motivations, failed not in
intent but in execution. Ulta Beauty's 2022 marketing team overlooked
the cultural implications of their email language, sending a tone-deaf
message that contradicted public expectations for brand sensitivity.
Netflix's 2023 password-sharing announcement lacked strategic rollout
planning and message clarity, resulting in consumer confusion. 

 BIG MARKETERS LIKE MASTERCARD, PEPSICO, AND NISSAN ARE RETHINKING
PRIDE MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 39% of executives say they will reduce Pride activity this year.
Political pressure and fear of backlash are pushing brands like
Mastercard and Nissan to scale back or delay sponsorships. Some
companies are avoiding logo placements or reducing their visibility
while maintaining limited Pride involvement elsewhere.
