 HOW BRANDS CAN NAVIGATE MISINFORMATION (5 MINUTE READ) [6]

 4 PRINCIPLES TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR WEBSITE'S
GUARANTEE (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A strong guarantee on a website is an effective way to address the
concerns of qualified non-buyers and increase sales. Frame the
guarantee, such as a refund promise, in positive terms to avoid
suggesting the product quality is actually questionable. Use your
guarantee to restate your offer and expand upon the benefits of moving
forward. Run tests on the guarantee to see what results in the highest
conversion. Think about how you can use a guarantee as part of your
value proposition.
