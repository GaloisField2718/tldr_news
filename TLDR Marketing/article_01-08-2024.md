NEWS & TRENDS

 FACEBOOK IS BANKING ON CREATORS TO ENTICE GEN Z. WILL IT WORK? (5
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Facebook is reclaiming its appeal to Gen Z by leveraging creators,
similar to TikTok's early days. Only a third of teenagers used
Facebook last year compared to 71% of those over 50. Initiatives
include events for creators, content updates, and monetization
opportunities. Some influencers are showing renewed interest,
particularly micro- and nano-influencers focused on video content. The
success of Facebook's approach hinges on unique, differentiated
content to draw Gen Z away from Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. 

 HOW RETURN POLICIES FIT INTO RETAIL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Retailers are moving away from no-questions-asked return policies due
to rising e-commerce, fraud, and high reverse logistics costs. While
lenient return policies can enhance brand perception, they are often
replaced with feedback-driven approaches to manage inventory and
improve margins. Customers generally accept stricter policies if they
are well-communicated and straightforward. Future trends include
frictionless return experiences, such as curbside returns and enhanced
online transparency.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO USE PRODUCT MARKETING TO DRIVE GROWTH (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 To be a great product marketing manager (PMM), you must understand
growth tactics and how they relate to strategic planning. Growth
covers three levers: acquisition, retention, and monetization. To
operationalize growth tactics to drive marketing, determine a key
growth lever to meet your business goals, map out product marketing
strategy and tactics, choose the growth tactic to double down on
simultaneously, then complete the rest of the marketing plan with
additional tactics across the funnel. 

 WENDY'S COLLAB WITH LONELY GHOST (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Wendy's partnered with streetwear brand Lonely Ghost to launch a
limited-edition line of merch and spicy ghost pepper sauce. This
collaboration stands out for its community-first approach, targeting
Gen Z rather than relying on celebrity endorsements. The messaging
from both brands emphasizes connection and community. Teaser content
effectively built anticipation, with Lonely Ghost hinting at the
collaboration before the official announcement. The playful rollout
strategy made fans question the partnership's legitimacy, adding an
element of surprise.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 GETRESPONSE: 2024 EMAIL MARKETING BENCHMARKS (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This report shares the latest stats on email and webinar marketing,
marketing automation, and landing pages. Automated emails outperform
regular newsletters, highlighting the value of targeted and
personalized content. Increased email volume in Q4 does not deter
engagement, suggesting that audiences do remain receptive during
high-traffic seasons. It's important to provide relevant content
instead of relying on quick-fix tactics for higher open rates (i.e.
adding irrelevant emojis or numbers into email subject lines). 

 PLANABLE (TOOL) [10] 

 Planable is a collaborative social media management tool that
streamlines content creation, approval, and scheduling across multiple
platforms. It allows teams to create, preview, and edit posts in
real-time. It also offers a visual content calendar, customizable
approval workflows, and performance analytics.

 WHAT SEOS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SEARCHGPT (2 MINUTE READ) [11]

SearchGPT seems to be much better at giving correct answers and
avoiding hallucinations compared to Google's AI Overviews. It also
includes more external citations, in many cases showing 5+ citations

aggregator sites for software and commerce queries, more so than
individual product or landing pages.
