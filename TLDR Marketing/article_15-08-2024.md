 LINKEDIN REPORT: DRIVERS OF B2B AD EFFECTIVENESS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A new study from LinkedIn highlights that both format and creativity
matter for B2B ads. Decision makers say that B2B ads lack humor,
emotional appeal, characters they can connect with, and a unique
perspective. Yet, when ads are seen as ‚Äúcreative‚Äù in those ways,
decision makers are 40% more likely to consider purchasing from the
brand. The study also found that video ads on LinkedIn tend to drive
more impact than display ads.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW REROUTING ‚ÄúPRO‚Äù USERS INCREASED SUBSCRIPTIONS BY 18% (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mobbin, a mobile and web design reference library, found that adding
elements like feature tables and FAQs on the pricing page dramatically
increased engagement and conversion rates for free plans, but in some
scenarios reduced paid plan sales. Its team believed that this extra
content was a distraction for the segment of users who had already
decided to buy. Mobbin ran a test that routed higher-intent users
(those who clicked on a ‚ÄòGet Pro' link) to a slimmed down version of
the plan pricing, without the free option. This resulted in an 18%
increase in transactions.

are consistent. Additional issues involve fixing redirect chains,
avoiding canonical interlinks, and redirecting 404 pages with valuable

 CALENDLY GROWTH STORY - A VIRAL PRODUCT WITH A $3B VALUATION (12
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Calendly grew from an MVP product in 2013 to a company now valued at
$3 billion. Early on, the company struggled to maintain a unique value
proposition in a crowded market, monetize its users without harming
customer satisfaction, and find the right level of customization to
offer to users in different segments. Ultimately Calendly succeeded
due to its freemium model, which helped spread organic word-of-mouth,
as well as its personalized marketing to keep users engaged. Some of
its successful marketing initiatives include webinars and educational
content, discount code campaigns via Google Ads, and enabling its
customers to embed Calendly in their own ads.
