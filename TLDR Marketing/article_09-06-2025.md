NEWS & TRENDS

 CMOS INCREASE AI INVESTMENTS: HERE'S WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 83% of CMOs are optimistic about generative AI, up from 74% in 2023.
Anxiety dropped from 46% to 23% and outright rejection fell to just
8%. 71% plan to invest at least $10M in the next three years, up from
57%. 68% are using or plan to use AI for live-action video generation
and enhancement, and 91% for text translation. On personalization, 50%
already use AI for product recommendations, 43% for timed outreach,

 MARKETERS MOVE MILLIONS IN AD SPEND FROM THE TRADE DESK TO AMAZON'S
AD PLATFORM (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Amazon is gaining ground in the DSP market as advertisers redirect
budgets from The Trade Desk, especially in connected TV. Buyers cite
Amazon's lower platform fees, flexible contracts, and access to
exclusive inventory as key factors behind the shift. With Prime
Video's scale and improved tech stack, Amazon is not only undercutting
competitors on pricing but also offering unique targeting capabilities
that are driving broader adoption.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WRITING AND EDITING ARE MORE IMPORTANT (AND PROFITABLE) THAN EVER (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Confusing websites lose millions because people don't act on what
they can't understand. Many struggle with writing clearly because they
prioritize sounding smart over being understood. To fix this, run
readability tests, keep sentences short, get to the verb quickly, and
cut unnecessary words. Replace abstract nouns with active verbs, avoid
dense academic language, and use simple sentence structures like “A
does B to C.” Another effective way to improve comprehension is to
speak your message aloud, transcribe it, and edit for clarity. 

 IS STARBUCKS' REVERSAL OF AUTOMATION THE NEW GAME IN TOWN? (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Starbucks is reversing part of its automation efforts after realizing
that the Siren System, designed for speed and cost savings, weakened
the customer experience. The system focused too much on internal
efficiency and not enough on how people interact with the brand.
Technology only adds value when it aligns with what customers care
about and supports what the brand stands for.

 CHROME EXTENSIONS ARE THE MOST OVERLOOKED MARKETING CHANNEL (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Chrome extensions are often overlooked because they focus on
traditional campaigns instead of tools integrated into daily browsing.
They become part of users' routines without interrupting workflow,
creating constant, low-churn brand presence. They also solve real
problems where users work, building habits and loyalty. Examples
include Buffer's extension for scheduling social posts, Todoist's tool
for turning webpages into tasks, and Mixmax's Gmail features for sales
productivity.

 HAVE YOU CONSIDERED "DARK MODING" YOUR BRAND TO BE AI-FORWARD? (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Dark mode has become the visual shorthand for AI-native companies.
OpenAI, Perplexity, and Hugging Face default to dark interfaces,
creating a uniform aesthetic across the AI space, especially for
developer-first audiences. While not all AI companies follow this
trend, marketers repositioning around AI are increasingly asking if
their brand visually reflects the shift toward intelligent
infrastructure. 

 RETAIL MEDIA UNPACKED: THE DSP ARMS RACE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google, Meta, and Amazon are entering the $177B retail media market
by integrating retail data into their demand-side platforms (DSPs).
With over 250 retail media networks, 93% would shift budgets
programmatically if it were easier. Each DSP varies in data matching,
inventory access, and measurement, with The Trade Desk growing quickly
and Amazon leading in closed-loop reporting. DSP choice affects cost,
targeting, and efficiency, especially as cookie deprecation increases
the value of first-party data. The fragmented market will favor
multipurpose DSPs and specialized platforms over a single leader. 

 WHY ‘SET IT AND FORGET IT' DOESN'T WORK IN DIGITAL MARKETING (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Running digital marketing campaigns on autopilot quietly drains your
budget because algorithms shift, competitors change tactics, and
audiences lose interest. Platform reps prioritize their company's
goals and push new features that may not align with your business
needs. The Show and Tell Agency shows how hands-on experts who
constantly analyze data, adjust targeting and creative, and focus on
specific business goals can deliver results like a 3.6% increase in
student applications and an 8.9% rise in enrolment confirmations.
Without active management, campaigns fade and fail.
