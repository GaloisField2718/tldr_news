NEWS & TRENDS

 DO WEBSITES EVEN MATTER IN THE AGE OF AI AGENTS? (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AI agents will soon transform how information is accessed online,
with these autonomous applications replacing the need for humans to
visit websites. This shift means that traditional web design and user
interfaces will become less relevant, as AI agents will handle data
collection and task execution. For marketers, this implies a need to
adapt strategies by creating content and APIs optimized for AI
interactions rather than human engagement. 

 NEW REPORT LOOKS AT SOCIAL SHOPPING ADOPTION AND TRENDS (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Social shopping is growing but not as quickly in Western markets as
it has in China, where Douyin saw $375 billion in sales in 2023.
TikTok, in comparison, generated $4 billion in in-app spending last
year. Facebook leads in driving social shopping behavior, but Snapchat
and Reddit have higher purchase rates among their engaged users.
Short-form videos are currently the most influential content type in
social commerce, though security and trust issues continue to pose
challenges for social shopping adoption.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 7 UNEXPECTED LINKEDIN ALGORITHM INSIGHTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 LinkedIn's algorithm tends to favor posts made directly on the
platform, so avoiding third-party tools and limiting edits within the
first hour can help maintain visibility. Keeping hashtags under 5 and
tagging only those likely to engage quickly can prevent the algorithm
from throttling posts. Including captions in videos and using vertical
formats can further boost engagement and visibility. 

 MASTERING THE ART OF THE COLD OPEN IN STORYTELLING (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A cold open is a storytelling technique that plunges readers directly
into the action, skipping preliminary setup to immediately engage
their curiosity. This approach grabs attention by presenting a
compelling scene without context, prompting readers to seek answers.
In marketing, a cold open can make content more engaging by showing
rather than telling, drawing readers in with intriguing details and
questions. It focuses the narrative on a specific moment, anchoring
the story and making it more memorable.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 DECKTOPUS (TOOL) [8] 

 Decktopus is an AI-powered presentation generator with built-in
templates and customization tools. It can generate a deck from a
simple prompt. Decktopus can also be used to create microsites, online
forms, and email signatures. 

 MINI TOOLS ARE 10X MORE POWERFUL THAN FREE TRIALS (3 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Mini-tools - simple, standalone apps that showcase a company's core
technology - are gaining traction as a marketing strategy. Examples
include Copy.ai's cold email generator, Wix's QR code generator, and
Canva's color palette generator, which provide free value while subtly
promoting the main product. The key to success lies in making these
tools independent, easy to use, and immediately valuable without
requiring sign-ups.

 THREE WAYS TO EARN YOUR CUSTOMERS' TRUST (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The process of selling should not be aggressive or confrontational.
Companies should try to understand the questions, fears, and worries
of their prospects. One tactic is to take on a teaching role that
helps prospects to be smart consumers, rather than talking down to
them. It's also important to clarify when your product might not be
suitable and provide honest comparisons with competitors. 

 ZAPIER'S GROWTH STORY (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Zapier grew to 10 million users in 12 years. It leveraged
programmatic SEO to create thousands of landing pages, enhancing
organic traffic and search result visibility. The brand's freemium
pricing model lowered the barrier to entry, attracting a broad user
base that gradually converted to paid plans. Strategic partnerships
expanded its reach by tapping into the user bases of other SaaS
companies. 

 WHY DO PRICES RISE LIKE ROCKETS‚Ä¶BUT FALL LIKE FEATHERS? (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 The "rockets and feathers" phenomenon describes how prices rise
quickly when costs increase but fall slowly when costs decrease.
Consumers typically make automatic decisions but think more carefully
when prices change. Companies maintain high prices when costs drop to
avoid triggering consumer scrutiny and brand switching.
