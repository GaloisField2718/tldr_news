NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW PEOPLE ARE SPENDING IN EARLY 2026 AND WHY IT MATTERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Card payment data shows consumers are still spending in early 2026,
but behavior is more selective and deal-driven. Visa and Mastercard
report a gap between weak sentiment surveys and stronger actual
spending. Higher-income shoppers drove the most growth, with the
top-spend band rising fastest in Q4 2025 while lower-spend bands
remained flat. Travel and e-commerce stay strong, and cross-border
volume rose 15% as holiday shopping moved online. 

 SUPER BOWL ADS ARE MARKETING TO THE ALGORITHMS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Super Bowl ads now drive digital campaigns as much as TV exposure.
Brands tease campaigns early, create meme-friendly content, and extend
the story before and after the game. They link content to product
drops or e-commerce to turn attention into sales. Mentions, shares,
and watch time help push content to the top of feeds. The Super Bowl
spot acts as a launchpad for online visibility and influence across
social and streaming platforms.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 21 FACTS ABOUT THROWING GOOD PARTIES (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The best B2B events feel like great parties rather than nonstop sales
pitches. Keep leadership relaxed so they can connect with guests.
Invite clusters of attendees who know each other and overbook
strategically to account for no-shows. Encourage movement with
standing areas, food, and drinks spread out. Train your team to host
and introduce, not sell. Treat events as a service to the community.
People remember the experience and make connections that pay off
later. 

 HOW AUDIENCE RESEARCH DRIVES GREAT CONTENT IDEAS (16 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This BuzzStream podcast breaks down how Revver's Rage Cage campaign
turned accountant frustration with paper into a live activation that
drove 90 deals and major organic growth. Great ideas start with
audience research, not channels. Takeaways include calling customers
to uncover repeat pain points and using Reddit tools like Gummy Search
to spot patterns. Build campaigns around one clear insight and tie
creative directly to revenue through email nurture and sales
follow-up. Strengthen your mid funnel first, and then take informed
creative swings.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 MOLTBOOK (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Moltbook is a new social network where AI agents post, argue, and
collaborate while humans watch. Built by Matt Schlicht, the platform
is largely run by an AI that moderates posts and manages users.
Thousands of agents are already participating, sharing ideas and even
flagging bugs. The project explores what happens when autonomous
systems interact in public, without direct human control.

 THE ECONOMICS OF A SUPER BOWL AD (17 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Ro's CEO breaks down why a Super Bowl ad can make economic sense
despite a $233K per second price tag. His argument centers on
attention density, with more than 100M viewers actively watching ads,
compressing years of brand awareness into one night. He frames the
risk as capped within a large marketing portfolio, while upside comes
from improved CAC and downstream efficiency across search, social, TV,
and OOH. The math shows that even a 1% to 3% lift in future marketing
efficiency can justify an eight-figure spend over 12 months. 

 ABG CMO IS EATING THE WORLD (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In today's attention-driven market, a single viral post can
outperform traditional ads. Startups like Cluely used extreme
storytelling and armies of micro-creators to generate billions of
views at minimal cost. Social engagement is now a form of due
diligence. VCs now chase mindshare, talent flows into content-first
roles, and marketing standards rise. Product quality matters, but
attention drives funding and growth. 

 TESTING COMPETITOR SABOTAGE IN AI RESPONSES (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Negative GEO is possible because some AI models will surface false
negative claims if that content appears on discoverable third-party
websites. In a controlled test using a fake persona and 10 established
sites, only 2 of 11 models cited the planted content after several
weeks. Perplexity included the negative allegations and treated site
citations as enough support, even without mainstream sources. ChatGPT
referenced the same sites but flagged credibility issues and noted the
lack of corroboration from trusted outlets. Results show that model
trust checks and source authority strongly affect whether damaging
claims appear in AI answers. This tactic does not scale easily across
most models.
