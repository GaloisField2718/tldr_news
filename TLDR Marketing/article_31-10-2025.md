 TUBI STUDY REVEALS STREAMING'S GROWING ROLE IN HOLIDAY SHOPPING (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Streaming is now a major driver of holiday shopping. Nearly half of
viewers make a purchase after seeing an ad. 71% shop while streaming,
often influenced by the content or ads they watch. Authenticity
matters, with 77% more likely to buy from independent creators and 43%
drawn to brands that feel real or high-quality. Viewers also engage
spontaneously, with 47% shopping impulsively and 60% buying
immediately when an ad catches their attention. 

 WHY SO MANY PUBLISHERS ARE LAUNCHING BRAND MARKETING CAMPAIGNS RIGHT
NOW (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Publishers like Reuters, NBC News, and Wired are running their first
brand marketing campaigns, moving into subways and social feeds with
awareness ads. They are doing it now because referral traffic is
declining, AI is threatening search visibility, and Gen Z doesn't know
these brands. With AI platforms scraping publisher data, brand equity
now sets negotiation leverage. These campaigns aren't just for vanity,
they're pre-activation plays for subscriptions and future-proofing.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO GET 50% INCREASE IN LEADS W/ 1 LINE OF TEXT (13 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 A top hospitality school increased lead form submissions by 50% by
placing a single authentic testimonial directly above the inquiry
form. The quote was short, specific, and paired with a real student
photo. This small shift addressed user hesitation at the moment of
decision. Rather than investing in a website redesign or new traffic
sources, the team focused on trust-building where and when it mattered
most to potential leads. 

 UDEMY'S FROM PLATFORM TO POWERHOUSE MARKETING STRATEGY (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Udemy built its growth by turning its business model into its
marketing engine. It created a marketplace where instructors promote
their own courses, driving organic traffic and lowering acquisition
costs. Its SEO-focused strategy and 200,000+ course catalog capture
long-tail search demand, while localized pricing and campaigns across
180+ countries make the platform feel personal and accessible. Udemy
for Business added a strong B2B arm that targets companies through
thought leadership, subscriptions, and success stories, creating
sustainable long-term revenue.

 BETH O'MALLEY WANTS EMAIL MARKETERS TO STOP BEING HARD ON THEMSELVES
(14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A good email strategy starts with intention. The “why” behind
each message matters as much as what's sent. Standout emails sound
human, use thoughtful segmentation, and prioritize meaningful
communication over volume. Focus on impact rather than vanity metrics,
viewing unsubscribes as healthy signals and engagement as the real
measure of success. Personalized and well-timed messages build trust,
while generic or image-heavy ones erode it. Pattern-interrupt emails
that spark curiosity can re-engage audiences. Like tapas, the best
emails are small, purposeful, and satisfying.
