 GOOGLE AND META'S CONTROVERSIAL TEEN AD TARGETING PROJECT REVEALED (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google and Meta secretly collaborated to target Instagram ads at
teenagers on YouTube by exploiting a loophole in Google's ad policies.
This controversial initiative, aimed at boosting ad revenues and
retaining younger users, bypassed restrictions on advertising to
minors. The incident raises serious concerns about the ethical
handling of data and the protection of vulnerable demographics. 

 INSTAGRAM UPDATES METRICS TO FOCUS CREATORS ON VIEWS (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Instagram is updating its metrics to emphasize "Views" as the primary
focus for all content formats, including reels, photos, and stories.
Creators are encouraged to prioritize reach over follower count,
aligning with changes in user behavior where people rely more on
algorithmic recommendations than following profiles. The update
includes counting repeat views and highlights "Sends per Reach" as a
crucial metric, reflecting how content is shared via DMs.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE EASIEST WAY TO 10X YOUR WRITING: FORMATTING (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Good formatting makes your writing easier to skim, quote, remember,
and share with others. Start every section with a single-sentence
opener, such as a vulnerable statement or a strong, declarative
sentence. Always look for opportunities to turn long paragraphs into
bulleted lists. Use subheads or bolded sentences to help the reader
more easily follow your line of thinking. Employ the 1/3/1 writing
rhythm to vary sentence length and make it easy for readers to fall
into your writing. 

 27 FREE TOOLS TO CREATE - TO GENERATE BACKLINKS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Offering free tools and resources on your website, like financial
calculators, infographic templates, icon sets, and interactive

 A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO CREATING THE PERFECT CAROUSEL (1 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Treat the cover slide like a movie poster or YouTube thumbnail ‚Äî
it's the thing that makes your audience want to swipe and learn more.
For the middle slides, don't jam pack each one with paragraphs or a
lot of text. Make your carousel flow like a conversation would, using
each slide in the same way you'd take a breath or break when talking.
Text placement also matters, so write out your content first, and
design it after. The final slide should summarize the key points into
a clear takeaway.

 MARKETING TEARDOWN: SHINESTY (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Shinesty is a men's underwear brand whose bold branding allowed it to
take share from the incumbent industry giants. Its owned media ‚Äì
Instagram, TikTok, email, and website ‚Äì feature a mix of memes,
behind-the-scenes videos, and clever copy. The brand partnered with a
college athlete for its paid media in their irreverent way: not
signing a chiseled model, but instead using an offensive lineman to
model its underwear. Shinesty has also taken a more chaotic (but
on-brand) approach to earned media, gaining coverage for covering a
customer's bail and offering free vasectomies. 

 WHY CAMPAIGN ASSETS UNDERPERFORM (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Nathan Jun Poekert, former Head of Social at American Eagle, says
that campaign assets often underperform due to rigid playbooks,
misguided trend-chasing, and the misuse of content creators. Brands
frequently fail by not adapting to the ever-evolving social media
landscape and by neglecting audience-driven strategies. Poekert
advises marketers to prioritize data-backed content that resonates
with audiences over traditional campaign footage. 

 WHY YOU SHOULD MEASURE CUSTOMER DELIGHT ABOVE ALL ELSE (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 In a competitive market, customer delight surpasses traditional
metrics like CSAT and NPS in driving loyalty and repeat business. The
Customer Delight Index (CDI) integrates various sentiment measures to
provide a holistic view of customer emotions, making it a crucial tool
for businesses aiming to stand out. Focusing on delight, rather than
mere satisfaction, can ensure stronger customer retention and
long-term growth.
