 üìó BRIDGING THE ADDRESSABILITY GAP (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Ever heard of the "addressability gap"?

It's the gap between what we know about our audience through direct
first-party data (such as browser and device data), compared to users
who stay completely anonymous.

And as third-party cookies vanish, the gap is getting larger and
larger ‚ö†Ô∏è

üëâ This is where Data Collaboration Platforms (DCP) [5] come in. A
DCP bridges the addressability gap and helps you connect with your
audience [5] in more personalized ways through:

 	* Audience targeting 
 	* Personalization 
 	* Reach and enrichment 
 	* Audience analytics 
 	* Activation
