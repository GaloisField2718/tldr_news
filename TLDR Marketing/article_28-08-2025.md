TLDR MARKETING 2025-08-28

 THE GOOD NEWS: YOUR BOSS THINKS SOCIAL MEDIA WORKS. THE BAD NEWS: YOU
STILL NEED TO PROVE IT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Sprout Social's new research [5] surveyed 1,200+ marketing directors
and CMOs. Turns out, confidence in social media is high... but trust
in ROI models is low. For SMMs, that means more pressure to tie
strategy to outcomes.

These are just a few key findings from the 2025 Impact of Social Media
Marketing report [5]:

→ 80% of marketing leaders plan to reallocate funds from traditional
channels to social 💪

→ Only 44% of leaders rate their team as "expert" at measuring
social's business impact 😳

→ Most marketing leaders believe teams should be increasing the
volume of posting 😱

NEWS & TRENDS

 20% OF AMERICANS USE AI TOOLS 10X+/MONTH, BUT GROWTH IS SLOWING AND
TRADITIONAL SEARCH HASN'T DIPPED (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI tool adoption in the US is slowing, while traditional search
remains dominant. Over 20% of Americans now use AI tools 10 or more
times per month, up from 3% in early 2023. Despite this, 95% of
Americans continue to use traditional search engines, with 86% as
heavy users, indicating that AI complements rather than replaces
search.

READ) [8]

driven 99% by creators. Short-form and humorous content dominates,

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TIKTOK SHOP STRATEGY: SOMERCE'S CREATOR COMMUNITY METHOD (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Somerce manages creator communities as long-term partners rather than
one-off promotional channels. For each client, Somerce runs a
dedicated creator network, gifting samples and incentivizing
participation through cash rewards, product perks, and competitions.
This model has driven strong results in beauty, such as Glow For It's
1,200-creator community with 800 actively posting. Operating on low
retainers with performance-based commissions, Somerce combines paid
top influencers for reach with smaller creators for scalable content
and sales. 

 WIN REPORT: WHEN USER BEHAVIOR SURPRISES YOU, PAY ATTENTION (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 A heatmap of a high-traffic product page showed that many users
clicked on the Product Specification section, even though it was
hidden in an accordion. The client's original page kept this section
closed by default, but a test variation opened it automatically. This
small change led to a 12% increase in transactions. The result shows
how analyzing user behavior and making simple adjustments can produce
significant gains. 

 TIP: POST-MEETING VIDEO SUMMARIES (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Instead of sending routine post-meeting emails that get ignored, turn
meeting notes into a 30-sec AI-generated video. Include slides that
summarize challenges, proposed solutions, and next steps. Add the
company logo, reference stakeholders by name, and include a meaningful
data point. Video tools like Synthesia or Loom AI let you track who
watches and how much, so you can tailor follow-ups based on
engagement.

 MKT1'S BEST FRAMEWORKS FOR PRODUCT MARKETING, CONTENT MARKETING, AND
GROWTH MARKETING (19 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This guide outlines MKT1's core frameworks for building effective
product, content, and growth marketing strategies. It defines product
marketing as audience-first research that informs positioning,
audience analysis, and ecosystem mapping, which are critical to
standing out against competitors and shaping a company's market
narrative. It recommends defining TAM and ICPs, prioritizing them into
tiers, and building an Ecosystem Map that considers competitors,
complements, and influencers rather than only direct rivals. Content
should be treated like a product, guided by frameworks like Story
Stack and Perceptions, with a focus on quality, strategic roadmapping,
and repurposing to maximize Mileage. For growth, select from six core
engines, adopt Account-Driven GTM, mapping both account and contact
lifecycle stages, and use bottom-up forecasting with efficiency
metrics. 

 REDDIT PRO GOES MOBILE: TOOLS FOR THE AI DISCOVERY ERA (3 MINUTE
READ) [13]

now on iOS and coming later this year on Android. The update adds
mobile access to the Trends tool, allowing businesses to track
mentions, keywords, and engagement opportunities in real time. It also

 FROM OVERWHELMED TO CONFIDENT: YOUR 90-DAY PLAN TO THRIVE AS A NEW
PMM MANAGER (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 New PMM managers often face overwhelm as AI accelerates productivity
but also creates more noise, lower motivation, and unrealistic
executive expectations. Success in the role depends on mastering four
foundations: purpose, people, process, and performance. Process is
becoming increasingly important in an AI-driven environment. This post
introduces a 30-60-90 day plan that helps managers transition from
consuming value to producing it by first building trust and clarity,
then refining systems, and finally delivering visible wins tied to
business impact. By day 90, managers should establish a PMM charter,
delegate ownership, and cement a high-performing culture while also
demonstrating their own leadership through impactful projects.
Long-term success comes from giving clear feedback, creating scalable
systems, and shifting from individual contribution to enabling
team-wide growth.

 GOOGLE: WE'RE TESTING CHANGES TO AI MODE TO ENCOURAGE CLICKS (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google is testing changes to AI Mode in Search to drive more clicks
to publishers. Updates include adding embedded link carousels to both
desktop and mobile, improving inline links for better context, and
expanding the Web Guide feature from the “Web” tab to the main
“All” tab. 

 SUBSTACK JUST KILLED THE CREATOR ECONOMY (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Substack now requires writers to use Apple's in-app purchases,
raising prices 30% on iOS, delaying payouts 45 days, and removing the
option to opt out. Apple controls billing and subscriber data,
blocking writers from taking their audience elsewhere. This shift from
writer-owned Stripe accounts to Substack lock-in reflects a broader
trend of platform control, dependency, and fee hikes across the
creator economy.
