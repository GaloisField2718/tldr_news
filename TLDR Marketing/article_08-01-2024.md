STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 7-STEP PROCESS TO WRITE A LANDING PAGE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A landing page will convert poorly with underwhelming copy. To start,
answer strategic questions about the target audience, the objective of
the page, and the traffic source. Then, define where the page fits
within the buying journey and select the main message of the page.
Spend ample time on defining the positioning, tone of voice, and
semantic keywords, and avoid generic language. Conduct research with a
swipe file, then work carefully on your hero section.

MINUTE READ) [8]

adjustments and negative keywords. Instead, try these 3 high-impact
tactics that don‚Äôt increase budget: redistribute campaign budget by
increasing budget on campaigns with below-average cost per lead (CPL)
and decreasing it on campaigns with above-average CPL, pause ad groups
that are 25% above your average CPL starting with the highest spending
campaigns, and pause any keywords that are 25% higher than the average
CPL.

 Forecasting pay-per-click costs and revenue is challenging due to the
