NEWS & TRENDS

 THE WNBA IS GROWING FAST — BUT IS IT FUMBLING ITS BIGGEST MARKETING
OPPORTUNITY? (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The WNBA is seeing record growth, with national viewership up 9%,
attendance up 26%, and merchandise sales up 40%. Much of the momentum
is tied to Caitlin Clark, whose popularity has brought new fans and
sponsorships, including a $28 million Nike deal. Critics argue the
league is hesitating to spotlight her fully due to internal tensions
and concerns about fairness among players, which may be limiting its
ability to capitalize on her impact. While the league claims its
marketing is balanced and intentional, it faces a critical decision on
whether to prioritize star-driven promotion or collective visibility. 

 TIKTOK CONTINUES TO FACE CHALLENGES WITH ITS IN-STREAM SHOPPING PUSH
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Douyin generated $490 billion in GMV last year while TikTok produced
$33 billion across all non-China markets. Despite a 120% sales
increase in the US this year, TikTok's eCommerce rollout is faltering
in key regions like Indonesia due to higher fees and content format
shifts. Western consumers continue to resist integrated shopping
within social apps.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW A SECOND “BULLET TEST” INCREASED SUBSCRIPTIONS BY A FURTHER
22% (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 When a conversion test succeeds, it's worthwhile to keep testing.
Optibac increased new subscriptions by 22% after testing a simplified
version of its already successful subscription page. The revised page
used shorter bullets with key benefits placed at the beginning, such
as “15% off and free delivery.” This followed an earlier test that
had already improved subscriptions by 39%. Together, the two tests
delivered a total subscription increase of about 70% from the original
baseline. 

 BEHIND AMTRAK'S ‘CHAOTIC BRAIN ROT' SOCIAL STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 With a small internal team and agency support, Amtrak experiments
with meme-worthy, “brain-rotty” content that feels unexpected for
a travel brand (ie. anime-inspired conductors or monster truck-style
train promos). This entertaining approach is balanced with informative
posts about train travel aimed at making the brand both relatable and
useful. This has resulted in viral success, follower growth, and
rising engagement.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 TIKTOK BULLETIN BOARDS: WHAT THEY ARE, HOW THEY WORK, AND WHY THEY
MATTER (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 TikTok has introduced Bulletin Boards, a broadcast-only messaging
tool that allows creators to share text, images, and videos directly
in followers' inboxes. Early access has been given to major
publishers, celebrities, and select creators. Posts bypass the
algorithm and create a consistent communication channel that
complements the For You Page. Bulletin Boards resemble Instagram's
Broadcast Channels and reflect a broader shift toward private content
streams across social platforms. 

 HOW TO USE VECTOR EMBEDDINGS FOR REDIRECT MAPPING (5 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Screaming Frog's new AI features can fully automate redirect mapping
during site migrations. By enabling HTML storage, connecting an AI
model with embedding capabilities, and configuring semantic similarity
settings, users can crawl both staging and production URLs at once.
After running a crawl analysis, Screaming Frog provides a “Closest
Similarity Match” and score for each URL, helping identify the best
redirect targets quickly. This saves hours of manual work and makes
redirect mapping much more efficient. 

 INTRODUCING CHATGPT AGENT: BRIDGING RESEARCH AND ACTION (10 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 ChatGPT agent combines web interaction, deep research, and
conversational intelligence to complete complex tasks autonomously
using its own virtual computer. It can browse websites, log in
securely, run code, analyze data, and deliver editable reports or
presentations based on user instructions. Users stay in control by
granting permissions and can interrupt or steer tasks anytime. The
agent supports integration with apps like Gmail and GitHub, making
workflows more efficient.

 BRANDS ARE LOSING CONTROL OF THE BOFU JOURNEY: HERE'S HOW TO TAKE IT
BACK (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Over 105,000 comparison-based keywords now rank Reddit in the top
three search results, replacing traditional review sites like G2,
Capterra, and Wirecutter. Threads in subreddits such as
r/smallbusiness, r/webhosting, and r/WordPress are shaping
bottom-of-funnel decisions through detailed feedback on pricing,
onboarding, support quality, and feature gaps. As generative AI tools
increasingly reference these posts, marketers are losing visibility
into high-intent traffic that no longer touches their owned content. 

 KEYWORD RESEARCH MIGHT BIAS YOUR SEO (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Traditional keyword research can introduce bias by assuming user
intent, much like how leading questions distort survey results. An
example includes a pizza shop mistakenly optimizing for keywords like
“Domino's” or “pizza near me” without understanding the user's
actual needs or preferences. Just as the best surveys ask neutral
questions to uncover real sentiment, effective SEO should focus on
customer problems rather than chasing high-volume terms.
