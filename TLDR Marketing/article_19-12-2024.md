 TEMU'S AGGRESSIVE AD SPEND FUELS POPULARITY IN WESTERN MARKETS, AT A
COST (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Temu, owned by PPD Holdings, is the most downloaded app in the US App
Store due to aggressive pricing and ad spending, including $2 billion
on Meta ads in 2023. Despite losing $7 per order and 94% of surveyed
users not trusting it, Temu continues to grow, leading app rankings in
markets like the US, UK, Germany, and Spain. It has faced criticism,
including allegations of forced labor and data mishandling, but its
heavy promotions, such as $15 million in giveaways, sustain its rise.
Temu's performance in the US serves as a testing ground for refining
its strategy.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE YOUR PRODUCT (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 70% of B2B startups struggle with clear differentiation in
competitive markets. This article outlines a framework that focuses on
selecting a competitive alternative and defining distinct
differentiation, such as binary or degree-based approaches. Real-world
examples include Slack replacing email and DuckDuckGo prioritizing
privacy over data tracking. 

 WHEN FASTER DELIVERIES BACKFIRE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Research shows that faster-than-expected deliveries in ecommerce
increase product returns. For every day a delivery arrives early,
return rates rise by 3.8%, with new customers seeing a 4.26% increase
per early day. High-priced items are more likely to be returned, while
popular ones are less affected. The effect stems from cognitive
dissonance; rapid deliveries leave buyers doubting their decisions. To
reduce returns, retailers should provide accurate delivery windows,
offer slower shipping options, and send post-purchase communications
emphasizing product benefits.

 WHY MOST MARKETERS ARE USING AI WRONG (AND HOW TO FIX IT) (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 To use AI effectively, there are 3 key principles that distinguish
strategic use from mere experimentation. First, skill is essential -
different AI models should be orchestrated for specific tasks, much
like a conductor leads an orchestra. Second, AI's true value comes
from asking the right questions, not just finding answers. Lastly, AI
should be applied to complex areas like segmentation, targeting, and
positioning, where it can deliver the most impactful results.

 2025 SOCIAL MEDIA, CONTENT, AND CREATOR PREDICTIONS (11 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Social media is expected to see a shift toward episodic, mid-form
storytelling, interactive content, and the standardization of in-house
content creators. TikTok's future remains uncertain, but its potential
ban could lead to TikTokers transitioning to YouTube. Instagram and
YouTube Shorts are poised for growth, with LinkedIn evolving into a
more casual and interactive space. There's a rising focus on creative
consistency and SEO-rich captions, while brands risk over-prioritizing
Gen Z and neglecting Millennials. Employee-generated content and
ghostwritten personal brands are likely to flop, but executive
branding will thrive, especially among underrepresented leaders. 

 WHY CUTTING ADVERTISING HAS DEEP, LONG-LASTING COSTS TO BRANDS (9
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Cutting advertising budgets can have long-term impacts, with one
retailer losing two-thirds of its revenue and 43% of holiday sales.
OptiMine's research shows that reducing spend damages brand awareness,
making it harder and costlier to regain customer trust. Longer-term
channels like TV and radio often face cuts despite their critical role
in driving top of the funnel volume.

MINUTE READ) [13]

audience targeting opportunities. Its unique culture rewards
authenticity, with 90% of users trusting the platform for learning
about brands and products. Brands like Semrush and Chevrolet
successfully leveraged Reddit's niche communities to drive engagement
and awareness, while others like EA Games have failed and attracted
criticism.
