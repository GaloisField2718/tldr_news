 2024 SMALL BUSINESS MARKETING REPORT (10 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A new report from VistaPrint and Wix takes a look at the state of SMB
marketing based on a survey of small business owners and consumers.
Social apps are now where most people find information about brands,
while SMBs are increasingly investing in social media ads. Traditional
marketing tactics, such as direct mail and outdoor signage, are still
effective at getting consumers to visit a small business. Promotional
discounts, loyalty offers, and regular communication all make
consumers more likely to shop at a small business. The report contains
additional findings about marketing tactics for different age groups
and how SMBs are investing in marketing.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 8 ELEMENTS OF A GOOD CTA BUTTON TO MAXIMIZE CONVERSION (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 CTA button copy should complete the sentence ‚ÄúI want to (blank)‚Äù.
Use an action-packed verb like ‚Äòsign up', ‚Äòregister', or
‚Äòdownload' to replace the blank. Adding a subheading underneath the
CTA can also act as an extra nudge. Use drop-shadows to make a CTA
easily identifiable as a clickable element. If a CTA is placed
above-the-fold, ensure it aligns with the reading pattern. However,
don't always stick to placing CTAs there, as below-the-fold may work
better for complex offers. It's important to test. Don't place
unrelated content, ads, or social media buttons near a CTA.

 A COMMON HOMEPAGE MESSAGING MISTAKE: USING SALES MESSAGING (1 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Many businesses mistakenly expect their homepage to perform like a
top salesperson. They translate functional value into business value
for prospects. ClickUp, a productivity platform, stands out by
prioritizing believable functional benefits on their homepage,
allowing prospects to envision the practice benefits without needing a
sales pitch. A homepage has limited time (15 seconds) and reach. Leave
the detailed value discussions to sales calls and tailor your homepage
with believable benefits. 

 TRANSACTIONAL EMAILS: WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY'RE NOT (7 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 A guide to what transactional emails are and are not, and the related
compliance requirements. Transactional emails include order or
shipping confirmations, order refund notifications, password resets,
or customer service replies. Triggered emails, which are not
transactional emails, include order renewal reminders, back-in-stock
notifications, abandoned cart emails, and birthday/anniversary
notifications. Transactional emails do not need an unsubscribe link.
For customers in the U.S., no more than 20% of a transactional email
should be promotional messaging.
