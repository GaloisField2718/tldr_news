THE US (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 BeReal is launching in-feed ads and brand takeovers in the U.S. after
being acquired by Voodoo for €500 million. It claims 40 million
monthly active users, with 5 million in the U.S., and says 85% of its
users are Gen Z. Downloads have declined sharply, dropping 60% from
31.5 million in 2023 to 12.7 million in 2024. The app aims to stay
relevant in a crowded market while trying to monetize its user base. 

 WHY EXPERIENTIAL IS SPARKING A ‘NEW AGE OF ROMANTICISM' (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 As digital experiences become more automated, brands are turning to
experiential marketing to create human-centered moments. This shift,
called the New Age of Romanticism, pushes back against algorithm
fatigue and AI sameness. Consumers are seeking imperfection, surprise,
and real connection. Brands like LEGO and Salesforce are leading with
immersive experiences that prioritize emotion over efficiency. Rather
than relying solely on tech, marketers are designing tactile,
in-person activations that spark curiosity and feeling.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 14 QUESTIONS TO AUDIT YOUR HOMEPAGE MESSAGING (BEFORE IT SILENTLY
KILLS SALES) (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A homepage is crucial for B2B brands because it shapes a buyer's
first impression and affects whether they take the next step. If the
messaging is unclear or generic, prospects may bounce or arrive at
sales calls confused, leading to lost revenue. A strong homepage
should clearly state the problem solved, the value offered, what makes
the brand different, and who it serves. These elements depend on brand
positioning first being clearly defined. 

 HOW TO FIND (NOT GUESS) YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Use data to find who actually needs your product. Start with research
from internal data, interviews, and tools like SparkToro or Google
Trends. Look for patterns in behavior, pain points, and goals. Segment
by behavior, tech use, or generation. Test your assumptions with small
campaigns and track what works and adjust. Keep everything in one
place and review regularly. Assign ownership so personas stay current.


 USING AI SEGMENTATION FOR EMAIL PERSONALIZATION (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To deliver truly personalized email experiences, start by combining
first and third-party data to build detailed customer profiles. Use
website behavior, surveys, and enrichment tools, then apply AI to
uncover behavioral insights you can't capture manually. Analyze
patterns in purchase activity, engagement, and brand interactions to
define named segments. Then match each segment with tailored messaging
using modular email templates. Test variations to find what drives
results, and use tools like Zapier or Clay to automate.

MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [11]

 ONCE UPON A TIME, HIGHLY "CREATIVE ADS" DROVE CLIENT AND AGENCY
FINANCIAL SUCCESS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The high-profit era of repeatable big-idea advertising is over,
replaced by high-volume, low-impact digital content. Agencies are
losing strategic ground as holding companies downsize experienced
talent, while consultancies gain influence with CMOs. To stay
relevant, agencies must reposition creativity as business
problem-solving, not just campaign output, and invest in the skills
needed to deliver measurable brand performance.
