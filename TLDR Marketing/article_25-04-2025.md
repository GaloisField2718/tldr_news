NEWS & TRENDS

 META FACES $7 BILLION ADVERTISING LOSS DUE TO US-CHINA TRADE TARIFFS
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Meta may face a $7 billion hit to its advertising revenue in 2025 due
to escalating US-China trade tensions and tariffs. Analysts attribute
this risk primarily to anticipated ad spend reductions from retailers
like Temu and Shein, which account for a significant share of Meta's
$18 billion in revenue from China. Although Meta has no user base in
China, Chinese advertisers have relied heavily on Facebook and
Instagram to reach global markets, making the country one of Meta's
top revenue sources only after the US. 

 PERPLEXITY CEO SAYS ITS BROWSER WILL TRACK EVERYTHING USERS DO ONLINE
TO SELL ‘HYPER PERSONALIZED' ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Perplexity plans to track user activity through its upcoming browser,
Comet, to collect data for targeted ads. CEO Aravind Srinivas said
work-related queries aren't enough to build detailed user profiles, so
it wants data on shopping, travel, and browsing habits. The company
expects users to accept this in exchange for more relevant ads and has
partnered with Motorola to pre-install its app on Razr phones.
Perplexity and OpenAI also expressed interest in buying Chrome if
Google is forced to divest it amid an ongoing DOJ antitrust case.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DON'T IGNORE THE “MIDDLE CHILD” (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Many B2B companies focus heavily on onboarding and renewals but
neglect the long "middle" of the customer lifecycle, where engagement
often drops off. This period is overlooked due to unclear metrics,
ownership confusion, and the difficulty of creating content for
established users. This leads to missed expansion opportunities,
declining usage, and last-minute renewal scrambles. To address this,
companies should implement milestone-triggered communications, create
mid-lifecycle value roadmaps, and develop re-onboarding experiences to
keep customers engaged. 

 AI VISIBILITY PYRAMID: HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR PRESENCE IN AI SEARCH (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI search is reshaping how visibility works, and traditional SEO
alone is no longer enough. The AI Visibility Pyramid introduces a
layered strategy that starts with strong SEO fundamentals, moves into
context-aware content that answers specific queries across AI
platforms, and builds trust signals through third-party mentions and
digital PR. Brands that consistently execute across these levels are
more likely to appear in AI-generated results in the new search
context. 

 HOW TO USE AN AI BROWSER AGENT TO CHECK FORM LOADS AND BEHAVIORS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To prevent unnoticed issues with their demo form, the team at MadKudu
set up an AI browser agent that mimicked a real user and tested the
booking flow daily. The agent fills out the form, waits for the
calendar to load, selects a time, and flags anything that doesn't
work, ensuring the full user experience is functional, not just the
form. The team used Convergence.ai and set it up in 5 minutes by
writing a plain-language prompt and scheduling daily tests. This setup
now alerts them immediately if something breaks, helping the team
avoid lost leads and surprise errors.

 REFER, EARN, GROW: INTRODUCING SNAP'S AFFILIATE PROGRAM (1 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Snapchat has announced a new affiliate program designed to drive ad
sales. Marketers, publishers, and creators can earn rewards for each
qualified advertiser they refer to the platform. 

 CREWAI (TOOL) [10] 

 CrewAI enables businesses to automate complex workflows by
orchestrating multiple AI agents, referred to as "crews," which
collaborate to perform tasks. Users can build these workflows using
CrewAI's framework or UI Studio, choosing between coding from scratch
or utilizing no-code tools and templates. The platform integrates
third-party AI models from providers like OpenAI and Anthropic.

 ANTHROPIC WARNS FULLY AI EMPLOYEES ARE A YEAR AWAY (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Anthropic's chief security officer has warned that AI-powered virtual
employees could appear in corporate networks within a year. This
raises urgent cybersecurity concerns. These AI identities would have
autonomy, roles, memories, and corporate accounts, challenging current
systems for access and accountability. Anthropic is testing its Claude
models for resilience and misuse prevention while cybersecurity firms
race to develop tools for managing non-human identities. 

 BRAND SAFETY IS BS UNTIL IT'S NOT (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Effective brand protection is now much more focused on anticipating
reputational risks and addressing them through strategic brand
experiences than reactive PR. Audiences do not respond well to
corporate statements as much as they respond to people especially
before a crisis happens. Companies that empower internal teams to
communicate externally, that show up in overlooked but high-impact
environments, and that reinforce their brand promise through
real-world experiences outperform competitors when trust is tested.
