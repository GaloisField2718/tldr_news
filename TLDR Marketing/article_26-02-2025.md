 ECONOMIC BLACKOUT: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE FEBRUARY 28 BOYCOTT TAKING
OFF ON SOCIAL MEDIA (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The "Feb 28 Economic Blackout," led by The People's Union, is a
24-hour boycott urging Americans to stop spending in protest of rising
prices and corporate greed. Participants are asked to avoid shopping
at major retailers, using credit cards for non-essentials, and buying
gas or fast food. The movement, which is gaining traction on social
media, highlights frustration over inflation and corporate profits,
and will run from midnight February 27 to February 28.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO GET PEOPLE TO LIKE YOUR CHATBOT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Customers are generally less satisfied when interacting with chatbots
instead of human agents, even when the service quality is the same.
Research found that chatbot interactions led to an 8.8% decrease in
satisfaction at a coffee shop and an 8.46% drop in an online
experiment. However, satisfaction levels were restored when customers
received a 20% discount or when the chatbot provided faster and more
effective service than a human. In cases where chatbots performed
better, customers were 75% more likely to stay with the brand, 166%
more likely to sign up for newsletters, and 110% more willing to join
loyalty programs. Companies should highlight chatbot benefits, such as
speed and availability, or offer discounts to improve customer
satisfaction. 

 MEME MARKETING: HOW HUMOR SELLS, EVEN IN B2B (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Memes are gaining traction in B2B marketing as brands use humor to
simplify complex topics, boost engagement, and humanize their
messaging. Successful brands like Mailchimp, Zendesk, and Gong tailor
memes to industry pain points, making them relatable while staying
professional. The key is to align humor with brand identity, track
engagement beyond vanity metrics, and avoid forced or off-brand
attempts at virality.

 50 UNIQUE WAYS YOU CAN USE AI DEEP RESEARCH FOR MARKETING (23 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's new Deep Research mode generates in-depth reports by
analyzing multiple sources and providing detailed citations. Marketers
can use it for market analysis, SEO, digital strategy, and customer
engagement, saving significant time on these research-heavy tasks. The
tool can comb through and focus on specific areas of interest,
allowing targeted research on specific trade publications,
competitors' websites, and customer feedback. 

 WHY YOU SUCK AT PROMPT ENGINEERING (AND HOW TO FIX IT) (56 MINUTE
VIDEO) [11] 

 Start by assigning a clear "role" to the AI, such as making it a
subject-matter expert. Then, define the "task" you want to accomplish
and provide "specifics" that clarify goals, constraints, and
preferences. Share relevant "context" to give background on the
mission or priorities, and use "examples" to guide the AI toward the
desired output style. Structure your prompts with techniques like
markdown formatting for better clarity. 

 INSTAGRAM EXPLAINS HOW ITS ALGORITHM WEIGHS TIME SPENT WATCHING
LONGER CLIPS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Instagram's algorithm measures watch time as a percentage of the
video but also considers the total seconds watched, ensuring longer
videos aren't penalized. Watching a portion of a longer video counts
the same as watching that portion of a shorter video. This approach
prevents creators from being disadvantaged by longer clips, even if
they don't achieve high completion rates. Instagram encourages longer
content to boost engagement, especially with the recent expansion of
Reels to 3 minutes.

 WHATNOT WANTS TO BE A HOME FOR UNCERTAIN TIKTOK LIVESTREAMERS (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Whatnot used TikTok's temporary outage to promote itself with a
nationwide newspaper ad, leading to its highest-ever seller sign-ups.
It offers live shopping across niches like collectibles and fashion,
streaming over 175,000 hours weekly—800 times more than QVC. The
U.S. live-commerce market is growing at a 32% annual rate, but it
remains much smaller than the international market, which was valued
at $1.3 billion in 2024. Whatnot surpassed $3 billion in sales volume
in 2024 and plans to expand its categories, brand presence, and
fashion offerings. 

 THE PRICING DILEMMA: FREEMIUM, FREE TRIAL, OR REVERSE TRIAL? (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Different pricing models have trade-offs between acquisition,
conversion, and retention, with Freemium driving user volume, Free
Trial maximizing monetization, and Reverse Trial offering a hybrid
approach. The right model depends on specific business goals, industry
norms, cost structure, and product complexity. To effectively test
pricing models, companies need to track total monetized users,
long-term revenue impact, and user behavior across the full funnel.
Poorly designed tests can mislead, so experiments should start small,
leverage cohort analysis, and measure effects beyond initial
conversion rates.
