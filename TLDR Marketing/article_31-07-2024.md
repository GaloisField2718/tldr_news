STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO CREATE AN EFFECTIVE PRICING PAGE (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An effective pricing page reinforces your positioning, provides
clarity about the value of your offering to your audience, makes the
sales process easier, and increases overall conversion. The number one
failure for pricing pages typically happens before you even make the
page: bad planning and pricing strategy. This article provides a
checklist for evaluating your page and includes deep-dive reviews of
pricing pages from Count, Klaviyo, and Lattice. 

 INFLUENCER MARKETING FOR EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS: 5 CHALLENGES & HOW TO
SOLVE THEM (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Providing every influencer with a free high-cost product is
impractical. Inviting influencers to events or asking them to return
products after use can be effective. Building customer trust requires
long-form content and long-term influencer relationships, which takes
time. Targeting influencers with followers who can afford the product
is important for authenticity. Influencers using competitor products
can be addressed by offering trials and ensuring they believe in the
product's value. Calculating ROI is harder for expensive products, so
focus on goals beyond direct conversions and evaluate success over a
longer period.

 WHY MORE AND MORE COMPANIES ARE KILLING THEIR CLASSICAL HOMEPAGE (7
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 We often refer to homepages as business cards, but traditional
homepages can be a point of friction. Ungated homepages, like
Google.com or Rows.com, put products front and center. They suit
companies with a large audience that can derive value independently,
business models that don't require monetizing everyone, and products
that can be experienced in ‚Äúsingle-player mode.‚Äù 

 THE STATE OF SOCIAL CAREERS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 An analysis of 50 social media job listings revealed a lack of
industry standardization in career levels and compensation. The
distinction between strategist and manager roles is often blurred,
with wide salary ranges contributing to unclear compensation
expectations. Responsibilities now include advanced tasks like social
listening, influencer marketing, and paid social. Demand for video
content creation skills is high, with roles requiring proficiency in
platforms like TikTok and YouTube offering higher salaries.
