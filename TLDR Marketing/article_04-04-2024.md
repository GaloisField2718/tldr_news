 BRANDS ARE GROWING MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THEY ARE PERCEIVED BY
CHATGPT (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 As people are increasingly turning to LLMs to search for product
information, companies are becoming more concerned about how these
LLMs perceive their brand. While companies can‚Äôt change what the
models already ‚Äúknow‚Äù about the brand, they can put out new
content in hopes of ensuring positive associations of their brand
names within AI language models. Right now, that exposure happens
mainly when a model is trained using a huge compressed version of all
the content on the internet.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

READ) [6] 

 Sherpany, a meeting management platform, found in user research that
its target audience saw the product as ‚Äújust another meeting
solution.‚Äù To better communicate its unique value proposition, the
company repurposed some of its expert content into a Digital

MINUTE READ) [7] 

 As consumer habits evolve amidst economic uncertainty, businesses are
exploring innovative approaches to drive growth and improve retention.
Loyalty programs that integrate pricing strategies such as memberships
through price-based benefits are very promising avenues. However,
challenges such as organizational coordination and analytical
complexities pose obstacles to fully integrating the approach. This
article discusses the main hurdles and the suggested approaches. 

 HOW TO PUT SEO POWER BEHIND YOUR BRAND‚ÄôS CASE STUDIES (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Companies often have their case studies tucked away on a tab on their
site and wait for prospects to navigate their way to them. A better
practice is to put SEO power behind case studies and turn them into an
‚Äúalways-on‚Äù asset. First, determine a category keyword by
describing what your product is or does. Next, decide on the use case
you‚Äôll discuss for the article. Then gather case studies that match
the use case and start creating case studies. Each case study should
include the current situation/plan, how you‚Äôve helped them, and
numbers to back up your claims.

READ) [9]

payback, addressing specific questions on what costs to include,

importance of aligning sales and marketing spend with future CAC

 HOW TO FIND INTERNAL LINK OPPORTUNITIES AND ISSUES (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Screaming Frog is effective for finding pages without anchor text,
pages that are linking to a specific response code, and pages with a
higher crawl depth. Google Search Console is useful for finding pages
with high volumes of external and internal links pointing toward them.
You can use these URLs as a base to link out to other pages. Ahrefs is
more user-friendly when it comes to finding broken internal links,
redirect issues, and orphaned pages.

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MENTAL ACCOUNTING (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Mental accounting describes why we treat money differently based on

with a credit card instead of cash, as well as why we are willing to
purchase currency in video games. Brands can apply this knowledge by
offering installment payment options, emphasizing long-term savings in
subscription pricing tiers, and enticing customers to return with cash
vouchers.
