NEWS & TRENDS

 OXYGEN MONOPOLIES (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Fast news cycles and rapid AI adoption mean startups win by owning a
clear category narrative early, since attention spikes fast and
hardens just as quickly. AI companies now reach $10M+ ARR in under a
year, and some hit $100M ARR with fewer than 100 employees, which
makes early brand positioning a real competitive advantage. Strong
brand association lets one company suck up most of the oxygen, as seen
when it becomes shorthand for its category, like Harvey for legal AI.
Brand recall now matters more than awareness, since even Tide holds
41% market share but ranks 9th on Amazon search. Companies must make
people think of it first or risk being forgotten. 

 INTRODUCING INVISIBLE ENGAGEMENT AND WHY IT MATTERS (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Most consumer interaction with brand content happens through
invisible actions that platforms do not track, which makes visible
metrics misleading. In a study of 12,855 social media posts, only 0.6%
showed visible engagement, while 22.3% showed invisible engagement and
77.1% showed none. The most common invisible actions were ‘see' at
42% and ‘stop' at 41%, which signal attention without public
interaction. Posts linked to invisible actions such as ‘see',
‘search', or ‘save' had a higher median shop engagement rate of
10.1% compared to 6.8% for posts that received a ‘like'. These
findings show that invisible engagement is more closely tied to
purchase behavior and should play a larger role in how marketers
measure performance.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 4 CTA BUTTON TESTS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Focus on first-person, personalized CTAs that reflect the user's
role, interest, or goal, for example, “I want top HR tips” or
“Save 25% on my wellness journey”. Use playful or contrasting
button pairings, like “I hate learning new things” instead of
“Save my seat”. Avoid generic verbs such as “Download” or
“Submit”. Replace them with engaging, action-oriented phrases like
“Get my discount” or “Let's go!” The goal is to make the CTA
feel personal and clearly tied to user benefit. 

 ASK USERS TO REGISTER AT THE START (NOT THE END) (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Asking users to register at the start of shopping increases
registrations, purchases, and long-term revenue. In a field experiment
of over 75,000 users, early registration made shoppers 58.1% more
likely to register and 10.9% more likely to buy. Those shoppers bought
16.8% more items and generated 13.2% higher total revenue over a year.
Casual shoppers browsed 12.3% less after early registration prompts.
Optional registration prevented short-term sales losses.

 12 STEPS TO WINNING BRAND MENTIONS IN LLMS (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This guide from Noble outlines 12 steps to winning LLM visibility.
Start by identifying the questions your brand should appear for. Check
what LLMs currently say and which sources they cite. Expand your list
with high-ranking, relevant pages from Google. Clean and score all
URLs to prioritize targets. Build a contact list for authors or
content owners. Decide the type of mention or update needed. Craft
personalized outreach at scale. Manage replies and negotiate terms or
swaps. Provide easy-to-use content snippets. Implement any reciprocal
mentions on your site. Verify that mentions go live and impact LLMs.

 HOW DO YOU COMPETE IN AGENTIC COMMERCE? (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Agentic commerce is reshaking e-commerce by turning organic search
into a verification gate for AI-driven purchases rather than a traffic
channel. AI agents powered about 20% of retail sales during the 2025
holiday season, and major platforms now support direct checkout
through commerce protocols that bypass traditional websites.
Autonomous buying mainly works in a narrow-middle since high-priced
purchases resist delegation and low-priced goods already rely on
subscriptions, so the real value comes from conversational commerce
that compresses an average 14-click journey into 1 or 2 steps. The
protocols force merchants to optimize structured product data and APIs
instead of pages. As a result, SEO shifts from driving clicks to
feeding trusted, granular data into AI systems, favoring incumbents
for broad intent and specialists for specific intent. 

 THERE ARE REASONS TO BE BULLISH ABOUT AI CHAT ADS (4 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 AI chat ads could reshape retail media, but their success is
uncertain. OpenAI and Google are testing ads in ChatGPT and Gemini,
while Amazon and Walmart explore AI-powered shopping. Experts say AI
ads could combine strong intent and deep user knowledge, offering
personalized experiences if they feel helpful rather than pushy.
Retailers want to stay the merchant of record and control logistics,
limiting AI's transactional role. Widespread adoption could disrupt
retail media by capturing intent and transaction data, but user
experience and partner balance remain key challenges. 

 WHY SEARCH AND SHOPPING ADS STOP SCALING WITHOUT DEMAND (8 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Search and Shopping ads capture existing demand but don't create it.
Growth stalls when the audience or queries are limited, not because
campaigns are broken. Broad match and AI Max can stretch coverage
slightly, but they still rely on search activity. True growth requires
creating demand upstream through content, SEO, social, and paid media.
