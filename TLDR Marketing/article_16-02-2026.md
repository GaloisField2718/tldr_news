 ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T PAY THE BILLS. CONNECT MARKETING TO REVENUE WITH
ASANA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Marketers everywhere are feeling the pressure: launch more campaigns,
ship them faster, do it all with fewer resources—and prove that
you're actually moving the needle on revenue.

If you need a moment for a primal scream, that's understandable. But
here's the good news: There's a way to do more with less, and it's
Asana [4].

 COULD OPENAI DO A FACEBOOK? (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Early ad testing at OpenAI has drawn direct comparisons to Facebook,
where early user-friendly ad promises later weakened under revenue
pressure. OpenAI says ads in ChatGPT fund free access and appear only
for Free and Go users, while paid tiers will stay ad-free. It claims
strict rules protect trust, keep ads separate from model answers, and
block personalization for sensitive topics. A former researcher warned
that similar guardrails at Facebook faded as business incentives grew.
Research shows 80% of consumers accept chatbot ads for free access. 

 THE FIRST BRANDS ADVERTISING IN CHATGPT REVEAL EXACTLY WHO OPENAI
THINKS YOU ARE (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ChatGPT's first wave of advertisers indicates how OpenAI defines its
core user and monetization strategy. Early brands include Adobe,
Audible, Target, and Audemars Piguet, all positioned around
mass-premium, design-forward, self-improvement categories rather than
discount or shock-driven products. The lineup targets
college-educated, upper-middle-income, and productivity-focused
consumers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 11 SUPER BOWL 2026 ADS THAT ACTUALLY MATTERED (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Super Bowl advertisers spent about $7M per 30 seconds to signal
cultural relevance. The most effective ads tied celebrity and humor to
a clear product message or strong positioning. Many brands played it
safe, but the standout spots connected to existing memes, social
tensions, and user behavior instead of chasing spectacle alone. Tech
and B2B advertisers used the stage to signal category leadership and
push product trial through demos and direct calls to action. Ads built
for social sharing and tied to a concrete benefit or value promise
were more likely to matter after game day. 

 7 MARKETING MISTAKES HURTING YOUR 2026 GROWTH (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most growth constraints are caused by the lack of execution
discipline, not strategy. Visibility suffers when companies rely on
low-reach brand accounts instead of activating internal voices, and
ROI suffers when content is not repurposed across formats and
channels. Outbound remains ineffective without signal-based targeting,
while inconsistent messaging and poor sales alignment reduce
conversion from engaged prospects. Expanding multiple offers without
concentrated distribution further dilutes results.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 TURNING CLAUDE INTO A MARKETING TEAM (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Claude Skills lets Claude act like a multi-role marketing team
through small task agents. Skills are markdown files that store
instructions, inputs, and output formats for repeat tasks like
campaign briefs and reports. Loading 5 to 10 skills at once produces
more detailed and task-specific responses instead of generic output.
Setup requires creating plain-text md files and adding them to the
desktop app settings. 

 WHY EXPORT GA4 DATA TO BIGQUERY? (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Exporting GA4 data to BigQuery gives full access to raw analytics
data and removes major GA4 interface limits. Setup is free and storage
cost is very low, and a site with about 30,000 sessions per month can
store data at no cost. Raw exports avoid sampling that starts when
requests exceed 10 million events and avoid cardinality limits that
group values under Other. Data retention is unlimited in BigQuery,
while GA4 interface user and event data can be limited to 14 months in
segmented reports and explorations. The export also allows deep
customization, custom sessions and attribution models, and easy joins
with ad, search, and CRM data, but it only collects data from the day
the link is created.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CHATGPT IS NOT A SEARCH ENGINE (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ChatGPT Search acts as an orchestrator that runs many parallel
searches and merges them into one synthesized answer instead of
returning a list of links from a single query. A Sonic classifier
decides if a query needs fresh web data, and it triggers search when
probability passes a threshold, with decisions made in about 196 ms.
The system expands one prompt into multiple fan out queries across
web, shopping, images, news, and local sources, then combines results
using Reciprocal Rank Fusion and recency filters like 7 days, 30 days,
or 365 days. The infrastructure relies heavily on third party
providers and scraped sources. 

 PAID ADS AREN'T THE PROBLEM (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Paid ads account for only 2% of primary consideration drivers among
B2B SaaS CMOs, while word of mouth leads at 42%. The problem is brand
credibility, not ad spend efficiency. Buyers filter vendors through
familiarity and reputational proof before engaging with campaigns,
meaning distribution tactics cannot compensate for weak brand signals.
Consideration compounds through a loop of peer mentions, reviews, and
repeated exposure, which AI systems now synthesize into
recommendations. Structured advocacy programs and public customer
signals increase the surface area for both human and AI-driven
endorsement, making paid amplification more efficient once trust
thresholds are met. 

 HOW TO CREATE POSTS THAT MOVE PEOPLE (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 More Perfect Union demonstrates that substance and distribution
discipline can outperform trend-driven social tactics. Its
YouTube-first model, now at nearly 3M subscribers with over half added
in the past year, combines high-volume long-form production with a
Shorts program that generates comparable viewership. Instagram
carousels tied to live news moments accelerate follower growth, and
video cut-downs are structured as complete stories rather than traffic
funnels. The team publishes natively instead of relying on outbound
links and invests heavily in titles and thumbnails to compete in
crowded feeds. The core differentiator is pairing sharp framing with
actionable solutions, positioning content to inform and mobilize
rather than simply provoke reaction.

App Store, lifting downloads 32% to 148,000 in 3 days as its ad-free
positioning contrasted with ChatGPT's.
