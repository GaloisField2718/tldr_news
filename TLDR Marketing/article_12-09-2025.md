NEWS & TRENDS

 HUMANS SKIM, MACHINES SCRAPE (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AI search surfaces content from Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, Substack,
and other community spaces instead of brand-owned sites. Visibility
comes from what people say, not what brands publish. To show up,
brands need conversation in public, indexable spaces. PR, creator
content, and user-generated discussion matter more than ads.
Influencers must go beyond mentions to demos and explainers. Content
should be structured for humans who skim and machines that scrape. The
most visible brands will be those people are already talking about. 

 NETFLIX PARTNERS WITH AMAZON DSP FOR PROGRAMMATIC AD BUYING (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Netflix is making its ad inventory available through Amazon's DSP
starting in Q4 across 12 global markets, including the US, UK, Japan,
and Germany. The partnership gives advertisers programmatic access to
Netflix's growing ad-supported audience, while Amazon offers vast
commerce and identity data for targeting. The move positions Amazon as
a central hub for streaming ad buying and further pressures
competitors like The Trade Desk, whose stock has already declined.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW INSTAGRAM HACKS PERCEPTION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Instagram grew by designing for perceived speed rather than actual
speed. It used predictive uploading by starting the photo upload as
soon as users selected a filter, which made posts appear instant. This
UX strategy gave it a major edge over competitors like Hipstamatic,
which focused on image quality instead of speed. The approach helped
Instagram reach 25,000 users on launch day, 1 million in 3 months, and
14 million in 14 months. 

 WIN REPORT: LESS HERO, MORE PARTY (AND 5% MORE SIGN UPS) (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Party Hard Travel redesigned its Ayia Napa events package webpage and
saw a 5% increase in signups. Heatmaps showed that while 80% of
visitors saw the package price, fewer than 30% reached the section
listing everything included, which meant most missed the strongest
value proposition. Interviews confirmed users often overlooked key
reassurances and benefits buried further down the page. Small changes,
like reducing the hero image size, adding reviews at the top, and
improving navigation, increased visibility of package details by 13%
and boosted trust. 

 WHY 60% OF ALL META AD SPEND GOES TO CATALOG ADS (60 MINUTE VIDEO)
[8] 

 Brands are doubling their spend on catalog ads (or dynamic product
ads). Once thought of as ugly, low-value retargeting units, they now
drive prospecting, brand awareness, and sales at scale. Misconceptions
about frequency and design are fading as advertisers see that
well-built catalogs can look polished and perform better with repeated
exposure. Beyond Meta, platforms like Pinterest, Reddit, Snap, and
even connected TV are expanding their catalog offerings, giving brands
more channels to grow with a format that reliably works.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 FROM CULTURE TO CONVERSION WITH META'S BRAND BUILDING TOOLS (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Meta is expanding Reels trending ads to all advertisers after early
tests showed that they boosted unaided awareness by 20%. Threads, now
with 400 million monthly users, is adding new ad formats, including
carousel ads, 4:5 image and video ads, and upcoming Advantage+ catalog
and app ads. Meta is also introducing simplified campaign setup for
Threads, allowing advertisers to run ads without a Threads profile by
using existing Instagram or Facebook content. Advertisers can now use
value rules for awareness and engagement objectives, and landing page
view optimization has been enhanced to lower costs and improve traffic
quality. 

 CHATGPT'S “BRANCH IN NEW CHAT” BUTTON (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Use the "Branch in new chat" button to fact-check AI output without
cluttering your main thread. Open a new branch from the response you
want to review, then ask the AI to list all factual or verifiable
claims. This gives you a clear checklist to confirm accuracy while
keeping your original conversation focused.

 DIARY OF A BRAND: LUCKIN COFFEE (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Luckin Coffee collapsed in 2020 after admitting to fabricating
revenue, but it has since staged a major turnaround. It is now the
largest coffee chain in China with over 26,000 stores, more than 10
billion drinks sold, and projected 2025 revenue of $5.7B, nearly five
times higher than during its bankruptcy. The company shifted from a
discount-driven model to a premium strategy, creating hit drinks like
the Coconut Latte and Moutai Latte that cater to Chinese tastes, and
pairing them with high-profile collaborations and cultural tie-ins.
Its data-driven approach to store placement increased new store
survival from 63% in 2019 to 93% in 2021, while continuous product
testing allowed it to launch 100+ new drinks in 2023. With its first
two US stores open in 2025, Luckin now aims to challenge Starbucks and
other chains in a highly competitive American market. 

 CONTENT IS NOW A RED OCEAN (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The era of easy growth through content is over as AI and mass
publishing have created a red ocean of content. Audiences are
overwhelmed with frameworks and reluctant to engage with content that
feels unoriginal or AI-written. Success now depends on
differentiation, auditing existing content with a stop-start-continue
framework, grounding stories in real experiences, and amplifying them
through distinctive branding. Marketers who repurpose lived insights
into skimmable, highly visual formats are more likely to maintain
attention while others disappear in the noise.
