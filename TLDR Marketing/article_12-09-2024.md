‚Äòaverage' Ad Strength, suggesting it's not something worth
optimizing for. Responsive Search Ads and Demand Gen ads both have
40%+ better ROAS when using sentence case text instead of title case.

character counts tends to hurt performance.

 SCARCITY: THE 3 PILLARS TO USING IT ETHICALLY (5 MINUTE READ) [11]

perception of value drives people to act quickly, usually increasing
demand. When scarcity is applied ethically, it leverages psychological

unnecessary pressure that could tarnish your brand's reputation, and
stay truthful to avoid using customers' trust. 

 GOOGLE'S AD TECH EMPIRE MAY BE $95B AND ‚ÄúTOO BIG‚Äù TO SELL,
ANALYSTS WARN DOJ (8 MINUTE READ) [12]

READ) [13] 

 Frequent podcast listeners, or superconsumers, are highly valuable
due to their spending power and influence. These listeners often have

shopping, and services compared to the general population. They are
active on social platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn, and Instagram,
making them key tastemakers who can spread brand recommendations. As a
result, advertisers see high returns on podcast ads, as these
listeners not only engage with content but also influence others in
