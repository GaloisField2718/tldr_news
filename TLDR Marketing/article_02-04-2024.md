 DOES YOUR BUSINESS REALLY NEED A MARKETING STUNT ON APRIL FOOLS‚Äô
DAY (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Many businesses feel pressured into tapping into every holiday

cultural calendar and choose the moments that are most relevant to
your brand and audience. While small businesses may lack the resources
of larger corporations, they can still leverage psychological tricks

 THE FUTURE OF USER RESEARCH: EXPERT INSIGHTS AND KEY TRENDS (8 MINUTE
READ) [6]

 HOW TO SCALE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION APP ON META ADS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post describes an optimal Meta Ads account design for a
US-focused subscription app. The account foundation is built on Manual
App Ads and all ad sets use bid caps. Trial conversion tends to be low
for younger audiences, so users ages 18-24 are excluded on an account
level and there is limited spend on users aged 25-34. To reach the
goal of targeting older audiences, the account prioritizes Facebook
Feed as the top placement, followed by IG Feed for scale.

 DISCORD STARTS DOWN THE DANGEROUS ROAD OF ADS THIS WEEK (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Discord is introducing Sponsored Quests as a cautious step into the
realm of advertising. It offers PC gamers in-game rewards for getting
friends to watch a stream of them playing through Discord. Companies

platforms. 

 I POSTED LINKEDIN CAROUSELS FOR A WEEK‚ÄîHERE‚ÄôS WHAT HAPPENED (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article breaks down the author‚Äôs experiment of posting PDF
carousels daily on their LinkedIn profile for 6 days. Results showed
that a combination of visuals with concise and insightful text
performed the best. Slides that broke down complex ideas into
digestible visuals and bullet points captured more attention. The
carousels also fostered many in-depth discussions and personal stories
shared by the audience via the comment threads. The author found that
the payoff in engagement and visibility justified the upfront
investment in design (via Canva).
