NEWS & TRENDS

 THE CEO-AS-BRAND ERA: HOW LEADERSHIP EGO IS FUELING TESLA'S MELTDOWN
(6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Tesla's brand value has dropped 26% in a year, from $58.3 billion to
$43 billion, as trust in the company has declined. Tesla is losing
market share due to leadership controversies rather than product
competition. Elon Musk's association with Tesla has shifted from an
asset to a liability, with his political endorsements and
unpredictable actions alienating core customer segments. Sales have
declined across large European markets, including a 60% drop in both
Germany and France. 

 GOOGLE BEGINS TESTING AI-ONLY SEARCH RESULTS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google is testing a new search mode that eliminates traditional links
and relies entirely on responses generated by its Gemini 2.0 model.
This new AI Mode, currently available to Google One AI Premium
subscribers, provides conversational answers with web summaries,
Knowledge Graph content, and shopping data instead of displaying
organic search results.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO DO BABY BOOMER MARKETING: TACTICS, FORMATS, AND MESSAGING (7
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Despite controlling nearly half of U.S. household wealth, baby
boomers are less likely to respond to ads, preferring organic
marketing channels like email, social media, and blogs. Use SEO-driven
content, informative emails, and video storytelling to reach them
rather than relying on paid media or rapid conversion tactics.
Additionally, since 84% of baby boomers prefer in-store shopping,
companies must integrate digital strategies with retail experiences
and create marketing sequences that focus on long-term engagement. 

 TIP FOR LINKEDIN POSTS & THOUGHT-LEADERSHIP ADS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After running a sponsored LinkedIn post, repurpose it as a thought
leadership ad to maximize reach and impact. In one example, this
approach led to a 4X ROAS, six opportunities, and two new clients from
a $5,000 ad spend in just one month. If you're investing in sponsored
posts, set aside a budget to promote them further with
thought-leadership ads for better results.

 THE CHATBOT MONETIZATION PROBLEM: CAN AI CHATBOTS BE AS PROFITABLE AS
GOOGLE? (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude are changing how people find
information, but monetizing them is challenging. Google earns about
$54 billion per quarter from search ads, which works because they
target user intent at minimal cost per query. However, AI chatbots are
expensive to run—each response costs several cents, while Google
searches cost fractions of a cent. Traditional ad models don't fit
well in chatbots, leading companies like OpenAI to rely on
subscriptions, API sales, and enterprise solutions. Despite millions
of paying users, AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic are still losing
billions annually, making profitability uncertain without major cost
reductions or new monetization strategies. 

 THE INTERNET'S FAVORITE DOCS: MOZILLA'S 'NEUTRAL GROUND' STRATEGY (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Mozilla's MDN Web Docs became the leading web development
documentation resource by maintaining neutrality, covering all major
browsers and platforms instead of favoring Firefox. It democratized
contributions with a structured GitHub workflow, attracting 45,000+
contributors and 11,000+ pages of technical content. MDN prioritized
user journeys by structuring content for beginners, intermediate
developers, and experts, which ensures relevance for all experience
levels. Its strategy made it the industry's trusted, shared knowledge
base, even as competitors like Microsoft and Google contributed to it
instead of replacing it.
