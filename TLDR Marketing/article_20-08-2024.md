 EXPERT EVERGREEN TIPS AND TRICKS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Evergreen content is defined differently across newsrooms. Generally,
it refers to content that remains relevant and drives consistent
traffic over time. Align evergreen pieces with a publication's core
topics, regularly update them, and consolidate similar content to
maintain value. Track and prioritize content based on traffic and
revenue impact to ensure the most valuable pieces are refreshed first.
Lastly, add an editor's note at the top to indicate when it was last
updated for transparency.

 7 BEST FACEBOOK ADS TACTICS FROM DEMAND GENERATION PROS (10 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 To optimize Facebook ad performance, use ‚Äúugly‚Äù ads that resemble
organic content. Incorporate real people into your ads, rather than
focusing solely on product images. Use Facebook's dynamic ad features,
such as Dynamic Creative Optimization and Advantage+, to automatically
test and optimize creative elements. Implement the ‚Äúengagement;
purchase; scale‚Äù method by warming up audiences, retargeting for
conversions, and scaling successful campaigns. Allow Facebook's
algorithms to manage targeting while you focus on A/B testing. Lastly,
switch to the Conversion setting for Lead Ads to drive users to your
website forms for better tracking.

the top priority should be hiring people who are both strategic
thinkers and effective executors ‚Äì scale the team by filling in gaps
around these people. This article provides recommended org charts for
teams of 1-10, 10-20, and 20+. 

 HOW TO MINE CUSTOMER REVIEWS AND RATINGS TO IMPROVE YOUR MARKETING
AND PRODUCTS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Online reviews act like digital focus groups ‚Äî they reveal what
resonates with customers, how brands stack up against competitors, and
common complaints. For instance, Tylenol improved its product labeling
after discovering consumer confusion from reviews, leading to better
customer satisfaction. Similarly, Est√©e Lauder learned about the
negative impact of a formula change on its ratings, while Sc√ºnci
realized its durability claims did not match consumer expectations.
Customer reviews act as real-time feedback mechanisms, showing which
aspects of a product are well-received and which areas need
improvement.
