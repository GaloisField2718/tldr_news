STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO TELL BRAND STORIES THAT ACTUALLY CONNECT (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Storytelling helps brands move beyond transactional marketing by
creating better connections with their audiences. The Hero's Journey
framework mirrors the customer experience: brands identify problems
(awareness), help customers navigate options (consideration), and
offer solutions (decision), eventually creating brand advocates
(advocacy). Complementing this structure, tactics like authentic
messaging, addressing customer pain points, and showcasing value
through storytelling tools such as blogs, social media, and UGC,
create a cohesive and more impactful narrative. 

 HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A "POSITIONING" PROBLEM? (2 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Weak positioning shows up when your audience does not understand your
product, why to choose it over competitors, or which problem it solves
for them. Trying to appeal to multiple segments also often results in
watered-down messaging, while internal misalignment leads to
inefficiencies across teams. Companies with multiple products may face
challenges in creating a cohesive narrative that ties their offerings
together. 

 MOVING BEYOND FOUNDER-LED SALES (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Warmly grew from $1M to $3M ARR in 2024 by shifting from founder-led
sales to a repeatable GTM motion. Its journey included scaling
outbound efforts, doubling its SDR team, segmenting roles, and
introducing partnerships, which now drive 12% of revenue. Despite
early challenges like email deliverability and team inefficiencies,
Warmly's experiments created a foundation for sustained growth beyond
founder-led sales which was not scalable.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 SLATE (TOOL) [9] 

 Slate helps social media teams create high-quality, on-brand content.
It features an all-in-one editor for creating videos and images
optimized for platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube
Shorts. The mobile app allows teams to produce content on the go,
while the Brand Hub centralizes asset management to ensure brand
consistency. 

 LINKEDIN: BUYER JOURNEY INSIGHTS WITH DATA-DRIVEN ATTRIBUTION (9
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 LinkedIn transitioned from rule-based to data-driven marketing
attribution by combining top-down Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) and
bottom-up Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA) approaches. The new model uses
transformer-based attention mechanisms to analyze customer journeys,
enabling more accurate conversion predictions and improving marketing
ROI. Initial results showed a 150x increase in credit for upper- and
mid-funnel campaigns compared to traditional models, aligning with
spending increases. The system is estimated to deliver a 5% lift in
marketing-driven revenue for FY25 through in-quarter optimizations.

 WHY DID DOORDASH WIN? (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 DoorDash succeeded by targeting suburban markets early, where
delivery alternatives were limited, customers were affluent, and order
values were higher. This created a strong competitive advantage. The
company prioritized logistics to dominate customer demand, ensuring a
wide selection of restaurants, even at the expense of speed and price.
DoorDash focused on reliability, app usability, and customer
retention, while also outpacing competitors in launching features and
partnerships. It also rapidly expanded its market share by
aggressively raising funds and investing over $3 billion in marketing
and sales from 2019-2021. Favorable timing, such as competitors'
constraints and the pandemic-driven demand surge, amplified its
strategic and executional strengths.

cultural highlight. Ad revenue reached $650M, with 30-second spots
