 STOP BETTING AGAINST GOOGLE, HERE'S WHY (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Each wave of “Google killers” fails not due to a lack of
innovation, but because Google's defenses are structural, spanning
user habits, product integration, data scale, and capital deployment.
The company continues to evolve with AI while anchoring itself in
personalized search quality, global infrastructure, and unmatched
platform reach. Consumer behavior, not just product performance,
remains the driving force behind Google's enduring search leadership. 

 THE FUTURE OF THE CREATOR ECONOMY REPORT (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 95% of creators engage audiences through direct-to-fan models, with
25% using personal storytelling as their preferred strategy. For
revenue, 27% rely on fan subscriptions and 23% on merchandise sales.
This shift reflects platform saturation and algorithm changes
disrupting traditional ad income. The creator economy is maturing,
with 61% working full-time and 94% diversifying platforms like YouTube
and TikTok to reduce risk. AI adoption has reached 91%, mainly for
creative inspiration and faster workflows. Music remains vital, with
94% citing it as key to engagement.

 THE ABCS OF NOTION'S B2C2B INFLUENCER STRATEGY (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Notion's B2C2B influencer strategy focuses on creator-led
storytelling to drive adoption from individuals to teams. The Notion
team uses tools like Archive to identify creators who already use the
product, making campaigns feel authentic and relevant. Briefs are
designed to highlight clear a-ha moments that showcase utility and
ease of use. LinkedIn plays a key role by encouraging discussion and
extending reach while also serving as a channel for community
engagement and social listening.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 THE AI SEARCH CONTENT OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST (GOOGLE SHEET) [8] 

 Optimizing content for AI search requires focusing on chunk-level
retrieval by making sections independently clear and well-structured.
Content with concise summaries and a factual tone should be easy to
synthesize. Earning citations demands accurate, up-to-date claims and
clear authority signals like authorship and sources. Covering topics
broadly and deeply through clusters improves relevance. Supporting
multimodal content and ensuring crawlability for AI bots is also
essential.

 WHAT NEW MARKETING LEADERS GET WRONG—AND HOW TO FIX THESE
MANAGEMENT MISTAKES (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 First-time marketing leaders often derail their credibility by either
clinging too tightly to the work or detaching too quickly from their
team. Four major mistakes are common: defaulting to random acts of
marketing instead of high-impact work, failing to delegate
effectively, neglecting coaching and mentoring, and ignoring internal
marketing. Leaders should model prioritization using frameworks like
KPO (Key Performance, Projects, and Ops) goals and delegate clearly
using review tiers and project briefs. Coaching requires intentional
time and tools like traffic light frameworks to focus energy where it
matters most. Marketing leaders must regularly educate the rest of the
company on what marketing does and why it matters. 

 SCENES FROM THE MOMA: PIVOTAL MOMENTS AND TAKEAWAYS FROM VISIONS NYC
(7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Brands today are being challenged to balance cultural timing with
emotional resonance. Creators like Andrew Huang and Dami Lee are using
data and digital tools while staying grounded in human connection.
Platforms such as Roblox and Apple Vision Pro offer immersive,
community-driven storytelling opportunities. Others are turning inward
to shape reality itself. Meditation expert Luca Del Deo introduced
tulpamancy, the practice of creating vivid imaginary companions with
agency, as a lens for internal worldbuilding. 

 WHY IS OUR ADVERTISING TO THE ELDERLY JUST SO OLD-FASHIONED? (8
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Advertising aimed at older audiences continues to rely on outdated
stereotypes, often portraying aging through extremes such as frailty
or exaggerated vitality. This approach ignores the complexity and
diversity of how people experience life beyond 55. While some are
planning retirement or managing health changes, many are still
building careers, caring for family members, staying physically
active, and pursuing new passions. These consumers express frustration
at being reduced to ads for stairlifts, wills, or funeral services
that do not reflect their lifestyle or self-image. Instead, they want
to see relatable depictions that mirror the full spectrum of later
life.
