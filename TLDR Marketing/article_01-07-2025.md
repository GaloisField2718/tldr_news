 CREATORS AS STRATEGISTS: THE NEW POWER PLAYERS IN BRAND MARKETING (5
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Creators have become strategic partners who now shape campaigns. Many
outperform traditional strategists by engaging directly with their
communities and offering real-time feedback. While platforms like
YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram now receive more ad spend than
traditional media, agencies often overlook creators' role. Brands that
involve them early see more authentic results, as shown by India's
Tira, which co-developed voice and formats with creators.

motivation and reduce friction.

 THE NEW SEARCH CONSOLE INSIGHTS REPORT IS HERE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google has released a new version of Search Console Insights,
integrated directly into the main Search Console interface. The new
report is designed to provide an accessible way for content creators,
bloggers, and site owners to understand their website's performance

 SEO TIP: UNCOVER HIDDEN CHATGPT TRAFFIC WITH LOG FILE INSIGHTS (1
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 GA4 misses how your content appears in real user conversations on
ChatGPT, since these aren't traditional page views. To uncover this
hidden activity, check your server log files for the ChatGPT-User
agent using tools like Screaming Frog. This shows which URLs are being
accessed, what questions your site is helping answer, and how often
your content is used by ChatGPT. These visits often convert at much
higher rates, so reviewing your logs is a valuable way to understand
your true visibility and influence.
