 BEYOND THE FEED: ADAPTING TO THE MODERN SOCIAL PLAYBOOK (7 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 The key success metric has shifted from follower counts to engagement
and shareability. High-entertainment posts earn up to 4.5X more reach
on TikTok and 13X more on Instagram. While follower growth has slowed,
shares have increased by 60% on TikTok and 10% on Instagram Reels.
Creators drive 6X higher engagement on Instagram and 3X more video
views on TikTok than brands. AI-optimized content boosts engagement
rates by 74% and shares by 66%. 

 A GENERATION IS TURNING TO ‘BUY NOW, PAY LATER' FOR BOTOX AND
CONCERT TICKETS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Young Americans are using BNPL loans to finance discretionary
expenses like Botox and concert tickets. These loans, with interest
rates of up to 36%, are appealing due to easy approval and no
immediate credit score impact. Klarna reported a 17% rise in credit
losses, and 3% of Gen Z Affirm borrowers are not repaying in full.
BNPL can encourage overspending and financial stress among a
generation already facing economic pressure.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A TEAM OF BUFFER CREATORS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Buffer is growing a team of internal creators based on the idea that
people trust individuals more than companies. By empowering its team
to create authentic content, Buffer builds awareness and brand
affinity from the inside out. Since launching its Creator Resources
HQ, 87% of teammates have contributed over 1.1K posts, generating
411K+ impressions. Buffer also runs workshops to boost creator
confidence and use AI to personalize content. 

 HOW TO BUILD PMM INFLUENCE ACROSS TEAMS (EVEN WHEN YOU ARE NOT IN
CHARGE) (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 PMMs carry big responsibilities but lack formal authority. Build
influence by mapping stakeholders by attitude and influence using a
matrix that identifies Power Allies, Skeptical Gatekeepers, Advocacy
Builders, and Quiet Resisters. Focus on delivering high-impact
projects for high-influence stakeholders to build trust. Maintain
influence by dedicating at least 30% of time to managing relationships
through communication and collaboration.

 I WANT TO ELIMINATE MY OWN JOB (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Growth as a field has stagnated. Most professionals are stuck doing
repeatable tasks like activation, monetization, and analytics setup.
These basics should now be automated through AI-powered tools built
directly into products, eliminating the need for growth teams to
rebuild the same systems repeatedly. This evolution won't eliminate
jobs, but it will phase out roles focused on work that machines can
now do better. 

 WHY GOOD MARKETERS THINK IN PROBABILITIES, NOT CERTAINTIES (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Marketing lives in uncertainty because people drive markets. Billions
of daily signals from consumers and companies create feedback loops
and unknowns. Despite this reality, many still believe that more data
or better tools will guarantee results. That belief is flawed.
Outcomes in marketing have many causes, most of which are unclear.
Marketers should think in probabilities, not certainties. Using
diverse data, placing small bets, and accepting ambiguity leads to
better decisions. 

 USE INTENT SIGNALS IN YOUR MARKETING PLAYBOOK (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Only about 5% of the market is actively looking to buy, so
identifying intent signals is key to focusing outbound efforts on
high-potential leads. There are 2 types of intent signals: external
signals, such as job changes or funding news, and engaged signals like
repeated visits to your pricing page or webinar attendance. Engaged
signals are stronger and should be prioritized because they show
direct interest. A strong content ecosystem helps create and detect
these signals, improving lead quality and closing rates.
