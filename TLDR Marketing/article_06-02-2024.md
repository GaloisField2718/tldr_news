 HOW A PRODUCT TITLE CHANGE INCREASED CONVERSION BY 23% (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Optibac, a brand of probiotic supplements, found through research
that site visitors were sometimes uncertain about which products were
right for them. User tests suggested that clearer information and
signposting would improve conversion. The brand ran a test with two
title variants on one of its product pages, each with more detail than
the control. Variant 1, which had less copy than Variant 2, resulted
in a 23% increase in conversion rate and a 34% increase in revenue
compared to the control. 

 HOW HUNTER RECLAIMED $10K WORTH OF BACKLINKS IN 30 DAYS (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Hunter, an email outreach tool, discovered it had lost 9% (74 links)
of the backlinks it acquired in the last three years. Website owners
had simply removed links or there were technical issues like 404s. To
fix this, the team built a script to identify lost backlinks, found
the contact information of the website owners, segmented the
recipients based on why the links were missing, and then scheduled an
email outreach campaign to request the links be re-added. Hunter sent
166 emails in its 30-day campaign and consequently reclaimed 31
backlinks.
