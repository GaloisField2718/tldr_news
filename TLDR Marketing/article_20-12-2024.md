NEWS & TRENDS

 INSTAGRAM TO MAKE UP MORE THAN HALF OF META'S US AD REVENUE IN 2025,
REPORT SHOWS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Instagram will account for over half of Meta's U.S. advertising
revenue in 2024 as it improves monetization, particularly through
Reels. Users now spend about two-thirds of their time on Instagram
watching videos, making Reels a key competitor to TikTok and YouTube
Shorts. If a TikTok ban occurs, Instagram could capture over 20% of
reallocated U.S. TikTok ad dollars. By 2025, Instagram Explore, Reels,
and Threads are projected to contribute 9.6% of its ad revenue, up
from their current share. 

 NFL TEAMS WITH BETCHES MEDIA TO GROW VIEWERSHIP AMONG WOMEN (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The NFL partnered with Betches Media to attract more millennial and
Gen Z women fans, with content launching at the 2025 Pro Bowl Games.
Women made up nearly half of the 2024 Super Bowl's viewers - a record
increase in female viewership. TV ads during women's sports saw
double-digit effectiveness gains from 2022 to 2023, and the WNBA
Finals had its highest viewership in 25 years at 3.3 million. The NFL
partnership aligns with growing marketer interest in women's sports as
a key advertising channel.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 8 WAYS TO REPURPOSE YOUR WEBINARS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Webinars can be repurposed into blog posts, social media clips, or
carousels featuring quotes and stats. They can also become audiograms
for quick engagement, eBooks for lead generation, or email drip
campaigns for follow-up outreach. Additionally, stripping and refining
the audio can turn them into podcast episodes for broader audience
reach. 

 “IS THIS REALLY THE OFFICIAL METRO PAGE?” (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 WMATA achieved a 347% year-over-year increase in Instagram engagement
by embracing platform-specific strategies like trend-driven content. A
standout post using a viral song garnered over 4.7 million views,
proving the effectiveness of engaging, relatable messaging. This shift
reflects how a tailored social media approach can transform public
perception and engagement. 

 ANTICIPATION MARKETING: CRUSHING YOUR NEXT LAUNCH WITHOUT BEING
SALESY (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 About half of consumers are slow decision-makers, requiring more time
to evaluate purchases. A well-structured anticipation marketing
strategy accommodates this by building trust, addressing concerns, and
guiding prospects through a thoughtful pre-launch process. The result
is increased sales, fewer sales calls, and more engaged buyers.

 THE ILLUMINATED COMMONS: BOND STREET'S BRANDED BRIGHTNESS (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 London's holiday light displays on Bond Street blend public art with
commercial strategy. Immersive and Instagram-friendly installations by
brands like Cartier and Chanel draw global tourists and shoppers.
These spectacles evoke joy and nostalgia while commodifying community
spirit, turning public spaces into branded "simulated commons."
Amplified by social media, the displays drive foot traffic and store
conversions. The piece questions how this mix of sensory experiences,
marketing, and competition will shape the future of festive displays. 

 FISHWIFE ISN'T A TINNED FISH COMPANY. IT'S A PACKAGING COMPANY (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Fishwife uses premium packaging and branding to elevate a low-cost
category like canned fish, charging $45 for 3 tins of sardines. This
strategy, common in categories like candles and chocolate, creates
value in social contexts, where presentation matters more than
commodity pricing. Fancy packaging transforms products into desirable
gifts or status symbols, attracting new customers and justifying
higher margins. Entrepreneurs and brand managers are advised to
prioritize standout packaging for products with gifting potential,
even in traditionally overlooked categories. 

 YOUTUBE AND TIKTOK PUSH FOR 'SATISFACTION' (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 YouTube and TikTok are emphasizing "viewer satisfaction" metrics,
combining session time and engagement to counteract "brain rot." This
shift pushes brands to create episodic and meaningful content that
retains viewers while improving brand perception. The trend signals a
redefinition of success in branded content strategies.
