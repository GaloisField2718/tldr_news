creators. Pulse advertisers will have more publisher content to place
their ads alongside, with TikTok signing Paramount Global and the NHL
to its suite of placements. When ads are served next to trending

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DOOR-IN-THE-FACE TECHNIQUE (4 MINUTE READ) [12]


 The Door-In-The-Face technique is based on Reciprocal Concession, a
phenomenon where people agree to a smaller request after a large one
is made. For example, someone is more likely to agree to a basic gym
package after they've turned down a premium package with a high price
tag. Brands looking to apply this psychological principle should
present hot leads with the highest-priced package first before
following up with lesser options. Other tactics include making an
affordable alternative easily accessible and offering a free trial.
