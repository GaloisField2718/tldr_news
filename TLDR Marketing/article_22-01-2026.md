 MY FAVORITE NEW SOCIAL NETWORK (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 People are moving away from public feeds toward small, intentional
email networks known as ‘Heartbeat Emails'. These are periodic,
semi-personal updates sent to a curated group of people you genuinely
want to stay connected with. They're designed to invite replies rather
than broadcast status. Heartbeat Emails extend the life of coffee
meetings and create space for honesty that does not fit on LinkedIn. 

 CONSUMERS SPENT MORE ON MOBILE APPS THAN GAMES IN 2025 (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Consumers spent more on non-game apps than games for the first time
last year. App spending reached $85B, up 21% YoY, as AI app revenue
more than tripled and usage surged. Users spent far more time in these
apps rather than simply downloading more of them. AI assistants led
the charge, dominated by ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Mobile emerged
as the primary access point for AI, especially in the US. AI has moved
from novelty to daily utility.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RESULTS FROM UNGATED CONTENT (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After spending $15K to generate just 106 low-quality ebook leads, a
team realized gated content was blocking real engagement. Only 3% of
visitors filled out the form, so they ungated everything and stopped
reporting on leads. They measured cost per engagement and focused on
pipeline and revenue. One year later, demo requests rose 265%,
pipeline grew 242%, and cost per engagement dropped 90%. By letting
people opt in only when they wanted the content, the team showed
ungating drives far more business impact than chasing low-quality
leads. 

 LET PEOPLE KEEP THEIR RETURNS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Letting customers keep low to moderately-priced items while issuing a
full refund increases repeat purchase intent and brand sentiment,
making customers up to 2x more likely to buy again. Across 9
experiments, returnless returns drove 24.6% higher ratings, up to
30.1% more positive reviews, and 30% higher perceived value compared
to standard return policies. The effect is stronger when it is framed
as customer convenience or an environmental choice and when customers
are encouraged to donate items, but it weakens if proof is required,
causing 20% less positive word of mouth. The approach works best for
frequently repurchased and lower-cost items, while profitability
depends on category, price, and fraud controls. 

 HOW TO MANUALLY TRACK SENTIMENT (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Understanding brand sentiment does not require expensive tools.
Collect 100 comments from influencer posts, reposts, and related
social channels like Reddit, Facebook groups, or TikTok. In a
spreadsheet, create columns for positive, neutral, and negative.
Positive includes intent to buy, or tagging friends. Neutral covers
mentions or facts. Negative includes skepticism, complaints, or
comparisons. Count comments in each column and divide by the total to
get a sentiment score.

 YOUTUBE CEO NEAL MOHAN'S BIG IDEAS FOR 2026: MORE SUPERSTAR CREATORS
AND TRANSPARENCY, LESS AI SLOP (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Neal Mohan frames the year as an inflection point. He's drawing a
clear line against low-quality “AI slop”, spam, and deepfakes.
YouTube plans to increase transparency through labeling and likeness
protections and continue treating creators as full-fledged studios
rather than casual users. The goal is to balance openness and
innovation with a viewing experience people actually want to spend
time in.

 UX STRATEGIST: THE ONLY JOB WHERE SAYING ‘IT DEPENDS' IS CONSIDERED
EXPERTISE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 UX strategy often stalls product progress because it avoids hard
decisions and defaults to more research. Many UX strategists charge
$120 to $180 per hour to produce frameworks and PDFs that conclude
further validation is needed. In contrast, direct fixes based on
obvious user pain points cut support tickets by 68% in one case and
raised activation by 23% in another. The real cost is not just money
but months of delay while products stay broken and teams wait for
clarity that never arrives. 

 NETFLIX APP IS GOING TO CHANGE AS THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH INSTAGRAM
FOR ATTENTION (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Netflix is preparing a mobile app redesign that treats the interface
as an evolving feed rather than a static catalog, reflecting how users
now discover entertainment through constant scrolling. Executives
framed the update as a foundation for ongoing experimentation, with
vertical video and short clips playing a larger role. The shift aligns
with Netflix's expanding mix of formats, including podcasts and live
events, which naturally generate ‘snackable' moments.
