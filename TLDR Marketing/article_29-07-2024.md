NEWS & TRENDS

 NON-GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINES BLOCKED FROM SHOWING RECENT REDDIT RESULTS
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Reddit's updated robots.txt file now prevents non-Google search
engines from indexing its latest content unless they comply with
specific agreements. This move, aimed at protecting Reddit's data from
being used for AI training without permission, leaves Google as the
main platform still showing recent Reddit results. 

 INFLATION IS STILL COOLING - SUPER CORE SERVICES INFLATION IS THE
STICKIEST (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose 0.1% in June,
with a YoY measure of 2.5%, the lowest since early 2024. Goods prices
decreased due to lower energy costs, while service sector prices
continued to rise. Real disposable incomes increased by 0.1%, and
personal consumption expenditures rose by 0.2%, indicating a
preference for goods over services. Low-income households have
depleted their pandemic savings, contributing to ongoing financial
stress.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 2 LETTERS THAT MAKE PEOPLE CLICK AND BUY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The "Identity Marketing" technique involves adding "er" to actions,
turning them into identities and making people more likely to engage.
By shifting the focus from an action to a role, such as becoming a
"beta tester" instead of just upgrading, marketers can tap into a
psychological motivator. This strategy, combined with using emojis in
social media handles, fosters a sense of belonging and can increase
participation. 

 HOW TO TURN 1X VIDEO INTO 35+ PIECES OF DIGITAL CONTENT (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 To get more mileage out of your videos, turn them into SEO-optimized
articles. Then put those articles through ChatGPT to turn them into
social posts (sample prompts are provided in the post). You can also
break your videos into chapters or topic-specific clips to cater to
more people. If your video quality's good, turn them into podcast
episodes or chunk them into small easy-to-listen episodes (ie. 5-8
mins each).

RESOURCES & TOOLS

formats, such as social media posts, newsletters, or blog posts. Once

 ACQUISITION CHANNEL THAT WORKS IN 2024: DISCORD (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 When promoting products on Discord, approach the community subtly.
Ask questions related to the product or seek feedback, rather than
making direct promotional posts. Engaging with community admins for
shoutouts in announcement channels can also enhance visibility while
maintaining a respectful approach to community guidelines.

 THE VIMEO PLAYBOOK: GROW LIKE PRO (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Vimeo holds 4.1% of the highly competitive video platform market. By
focusing on the specific needs of independent creators, it built a
loyal user base despite competition from giants like YouTube.
Strategic partnerships with companies like Simon Data and Salesforce
improved user engagement and retention. Vimeo also invested in
business video creation tools, creator tools, and SEO optimization
tools to strengthen its value to various user segments. 

 THE DUOLINGO DILEMMA: HOW TO SURVIVE A USER REVOLT (4 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Duolingo's 2022 app redesign initially sparked significant outrage,
but the CEO maintained that the changes were science-based and aimed
at improving the experience for new learners. A year later, the app
experienced a 63% increase in daily active users and a 44% revenue
boost. Brands should ensure that major changes align with their core
values rather than chasing trends. To prepare for such changes,
gradual rollouts, self-help resources, and incentives for early
adopters are essential. Feedback loops should be implemented, along
with metrics to monitor performance.
