NEWS & TRENDS

 47% OF CONSUMERS CHECK CUSTOMER FEEDBACK BEFORE BUYING RECOMMENDED
ITEMS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Over half of U.S. consumers (56%) make a purchase recommended by an
influencer at least once a year, with 12% doing so frequently. Younger
generations, especially Gen Z (80%) and millennials (72%), are more
likely to follow influencer suggestions than baby boomers (28%).
Despite this, 95% of those who buy based on influencer input conduct
additional research, mostly by reading customer reviews and comparing
prices. Surprisingly, baby boomers show the highest rate of impulse
buys on first exposure and are also the most likely to keep
influencer-recommended items, with 59% returning them less often than
other purchases.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AI OVERVIEWS ARE EATING YOUR SEARCH TRAFFIC: HERE'S HOW TO ADAPT (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Click-through rates are dropping by up to 35% due to Google's AI
Overviews, even as content impressions grow. This disconnect is
forcing a redefinition of content success, where marketers are
concentrating effort on qualified conversions and topic-level
performance over traffic volume. Winning strategies include auditing
BOFU coverage for intent-rich queries, embedding context-specific
product mentions in early-funnel content, and using conversion data to
build scalable content clusters that drive meaningful business
outcomes. 

 BEST MARKETING CAMPAIGNS: WHAT MAKES THEM ICONIC, EFFECTIVE, AND
ENDURING (8 MINUTE READ) [7]

build trust, and align with cultural moments. Campaigns like Dove's
“Real Beauty” and Nike's “Just Do It” show how emotional
storytelling and authenticity increase engagement and brand loyalty.
User-generated content builds trust, while omnichannel strategies
ensure consistent messaging across platforms. Spotify Wrapped
demonstrates how personalization and social sharing can drive massive
user participation and brand visibility. Personalized offers can raise
click-through rates by 5% to 25%.

 WELCOME TO OFF THE CUFF BY AMERICAN EAGLE (4 MINUTE READ) [11]

styles like jorts, flip-flops, and lace vests, alongside lo-fi

culture are rising, while blue eyeshadow and intentional rest through

 ASHLEY RUDDER'S CREATIVE DARWINISM PHILOSOPHY (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Ashley Rudder, Chief Creator Officer at DNY, believes creators are no
longer tactics. They're media, and media must perform. At DNY,
creators work across every department, reshaping how advertising is
developed and measured. Rudder moves beyond outdated metrics like
follower count and EMV, focusing instead on real engagement and
business impact. The goal is to help brands build real, human
connections through content that feels authentic rather than
corporate.
