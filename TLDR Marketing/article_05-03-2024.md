 "CONVERSION" COPYWRITING: WHY THE ART OF COPYWRITING NEEDS A REBRAND
(5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Company leadership tends to undervalue copywriting because they
misunderstand what it is. It is not a quest for the magic phrase that
will resonate with every single visitor, a rote restating of your
company‚Äôs internal product positioning, or a list of product
features. Good copy is designed to elicit a reaction and is always
about conversion. Conversion copywriting should encapsulate a holistic
view of the entire user journey. However, leaders often measure copy
by the same bottom-of-funnel metrics.

READ) [14]

expanded to audiences with similar needs. 

 HOW ONE GOOGLE FEATURED SNIPPET IS KILLING COMMERCIAL LIST-BASED
CONTENT (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The evolution of Google‚Äôs search features, specifically the
introduction of ‚ÄúFrom sources across the web,‚Äù has raised concerns
about search result fairness and accuracy. By prioritizing list-based
content from big enterprises and neglecting original ideas from
independent publishers, Google‚Äôs practices contradict its own
content guidelines and exacerbate competition issues. Its practices
diminish the visibility of original publishers and rely heavily on
paid placements, perpetuating a cycle of unoriginality and
commercialization in search results.
