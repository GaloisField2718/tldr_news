STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SEGMENTING PEOPLE VS. OCCASIONS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Segmentation based on occasions, rather than people, is more
effective because behavior is often shaped by context. For example,
dinner or travel choices vary depending on the situation or
companions. Focusing on these contextual factors provides more
consistent insights, while people-based segmentation often leads to
inconsistencies.

 WHY BLACK CULTURE-FOCUSED TENTPOLE EVENTS SHOULD BE ON YOUR BRAND'S
RADAR (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Brands often overlook Black culture-focused tentpole events, missing
opportunities to connect with influential Black consumers despite
their proven economic power and cultural influence. These events offer
unique access to key audiences, yet brands often prioritize mainstream
events like Coachella, leaving them out of vital conversations. 

 WHY BEAUTY BRANDS ARE TURNING TO PODCASTS TO ADVERTISE (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Beauty brands are turning to podcasts to build trust with audiences,
especially Hispanics, who spend 37% more annually on beauty than the
general market. Sonoro Global Media, which caters to multicultural
listeners, sees brands like Ulta and Estée Lauder spending $200K on
podcast ads. Podcasts influence 60% of men and 62% of listeners aged
18–34, driving US ad spend to $2.28 billion in 2024, up 15.9% YoY. 

 WHY ‘RISK ON MARKETING INVESTMENT' IS THE NEW ROI (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 A Fortune 100 CEO redefines ROI as "risk on marketing investment" to
emphasize the importance of managing uncertainties and opportunity
costs in marketing spend. Traditional ROI metrics are ineffective, he
believes, with up to 30% of billion-dollar marketing budgets getting
wasted. The CEO advocates reallocating funds to initiatives like
talent acquisition and market expansion. He stresses the importance of
reputation and brand trust, noting that demand generation often fails
to demonstrate tangible results. C-suites increasingly demand precise,
data-driven accountability in marketing and other functions, driven by
external pressures like economic volatility and shareholder scrutiny.
