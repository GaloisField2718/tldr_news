NEWS & TRENDS

 WHAT COUNTS AS TV NOW ANYWAY? (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Global linear TV ad spend is projected to fall to $139.1bn in 2026,
its lowest since 2005, after declining 27.5% between 2014 and 2024 and
50.8% when adjusted for inflation. Audiences are shifting from linear
to connected TV, which now accounts for nearly half of TV usage in the
US, while YouTube earned $36bn in US ad sales last year, surpassing
all four broadcast networks combined. Fragmentation and measurement
gaps remain a challenge, but retail data integration is reshaping how
advertisers measure outcomes and plan campaigns. Smaller brands, which
allocate only 9% of ad budgets to TV compared to 38% for large brands,
may gain new opportunities as CTV moves toward programmatic selling. 

 THE REALITY ENGINE - HOW BRANDS CAN NAVIGATE NEW PLANES OF HUMAN
CONNECTION (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tulpamancy and synthetic intimacy show how people are creating
companions and relationships through imagination and AI, from Reddit
communities building tulpas to users forming bonds with chatbots.
These practices provide comfort, therapy, and connection, but also
carry risks of manipulation and harm, as seen in cases linked to AI
platforms. Trust in AI remains low, though use is growing among
younger people who treat these interactions as real. Brands are
beginning to explore similar dynamics through worldbuilding and
attachment, raising questions about how far engineered intimacy can go
before it undermines human agency. 

 DOLLAR STORES DRAW IN MORE SHOPPERS MAKING 6 FIGURES AMERICANS ACROSS
INCOME LEVELS LOOK TO SAVE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Dollar stores are attracting more affluent shoppers as consumers
across income levels look for value. At Dollar Tree, customers earning
over $100K made up two-thirds of new shoppers in Q2, up from 50% in
Q1. Dollar General also saw same-store sales rise 2.8%, fueled by
higher foot traffic and basket size. Middle and higher-income shoppers
are increasingly trading down, making them a larger force in overall
retail spending.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 STRIPE'S $1.4 TRILLION PLATFORM STRATEGY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stripe processes $1.4 trillion annually, equal to 1.3% of global GDP,
by positioning itself as the payments engine behind major platforms
like Shopify and Lyft. Its success comes from frictionless
integration, offering clean APIs, strong developer documentation, and
self-serve tools that make it the default choice for engineering
teams. It deepened platform lock-in by expanding into adjacent
services like fraud prevention, billing, and lending, which increased
switching costs and made it indispensable to partners. Stripe also
built a win-win ecosystem through partner incentives, co-marketing,
and technical support that fueled both its own growth and that of its
platform customers. 

 LAUNCH ABSURD MINI-PRODUCTS TO MAKE YOUR BRAND COOL (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Research shows that launching products unrelated to a brand's core
category makes people view the brand as cooler. Across 4 experiments
with 1,454 participants and over 5,000 social media comments,
unrelated extensions like KFC's fried chicken-scented nail polish or a
hot pot brand's spicy toothpaste increased perceived coolness by up to
20%. The effect is stronger for popular brands and co-branded
products, such as McDonald's being rated 9.7% cooler with its Adidas
sneaker launch, and weaker when extensions are too close to the core
category. The strategy works because it surprises consumers, creates
humor, and signals creativity and rebellion.

 A wave of UGC gig platforms is emerging, with apps like Noise, Home
from College, SideShift, and PayPer using TikTok-first strategies to

 HOW TO PRODUCTIZE AI ANXIETY (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Workers aged 22-25 in highly AI-exposed jobs, such as software
developers and customer service agents, saw a 13% drop in employment
since ChatGPT's launch. Meanwhile, older workers and less-exposed
roles held steady or grew. Companies are not firing at scale but are
slowing hiring, which hits new entrants hardest. Applied AI firms must
address worker anxiety, build trust through clear benefits like time
savings and cost reduction, and design simple products that focus on
core features before expanding. 

 CO-OPTING THE COSY WEB (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This discussion looks at whether genuine human emotion can survive in
spaces increasingly co-opted by brands. It contrasts the noisy
competition of public platforms with the intimacy of “Dark Forest”
communities, where trust shifts to private spaces. It warns that brand
intrusion erodes these safe zones, while authenticity and community
cannot be manufactured. It also introduces the Bentoism framework,
which balances near-term self-interest with long-term responsibility,
while reflecting on cultural flattening, the limits of post-capitalist
visions, and the ongoing search for meaningful online spaces. 

 YEARS OF MARKETING UNDERINVESTMENT CATCH UP TO KRAFT HEINZ (3 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Kraft Heinz has spent just 3.2%-4.6% of net sales on advertising and
marketing since 2016, far below competitors like Constellation Brands
and Hostess Brands that invest 7%-10%. Despite generating billions in
cash, the company prioritized dividends and stock buybacks while
writing down $37 billion in goodwill and intangibles since 2016. As
Kraft Heinz prepares to split into two entities, its marketing
investment strategy could be as critical as debt and dividend policies
in shaping future performance.
