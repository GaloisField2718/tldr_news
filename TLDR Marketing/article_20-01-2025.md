NEWS & TRENDS

 TIKTOK IS BACK ONLINE IN THE U.S., FOLLOWING TRUMP'S PROMISE TO PAUSE
THE BAN (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TikTok faced a 14-hour-long blackout in the U.S. due to a ban
requiring it to separate from its China-based owner, ByteDance.
President-elect Trump temporarily paused enforcement of the ban,
allowing web-hosting companies like Oracle and Akamai to restore
service, but Apple and Google have yet to reinstate TikTok on their
app stores. Without Apple and Google's support, TikTok cannot gain new
users, provide updates, or process in-app purchases, jeopardizing its
revenue. Legal and political uncertainties remain. Potential fines for
TikTok could reach billions of dollars.

streamline workflows while keeping humans involved in nuanced
decision-making.

 8 THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN BUDGETING FOR AN INFLUENCER MARKETING
CAMPAIGN (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To set an influencer marketing budget, define how many assets you
need, their type, and the number of influencers to work with. Specify
how many assets each influencer will create, establish KPIs, and
decide whether to boost content. Target influencers based on reach,
engagement, and focus channels. Simplify briefs to streamline
collaboration. 

 THE STUPIDEST MARKETING MISTAKES I SEE PEOPLE MAKE (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Many marketing efforts fail due to easily avoidable mistakes such as
dismissing email campaigns, which usually deliver the highest ROI, or
ignoring the compounding benefits of improved customer retention. Many
marketers also treat virality or trend-chasing as a strategy, which
creates inefficiencies and dilutes focus. On the other hand, strong
marketing programs succeed by focusing on consistent, data-driven
approaches that prioritize foundational tactics and sustained audience
engagement. 

 MOST B2B MARKETERS ARE STILL CREATING CONTENT LIKE IT'S 2010 (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 95% of website visitors aren't ready to buy, yet most B2B content
focuses only on the 5% who are. A more effective strategy involves
creating long-form subject matter content that provides in-depth
value, leveraging editorial newsletters as a reliable channel to build
trust, and using executive social posts to reinforce messaging.
Together, these three pillars create a system that not only engages a
broader audience, but also drives sustainable growth by building trust
and nurturing potential leads over time.

 HOW TO RUN YOUR MARKETING TEAM DAY-TO-DAY (16 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 To establish an effective marketing operating cadence, break

tools like Asana to track milestones, provide weekly async status
updates, and hold focused weekly marketing meetings. Implement
structured project kickoffs using GACCS briefs (Goals, Audience,
Content, Channels, Stakeholders) to ensure alignment with broader
goals. Regularly update and share a marketing decision dashboard that
outlines priorities, storylines, and revenue growth levers. Tie
deliverables on marketing calendars to specific goals and require
requests to support these goals, fostering strategic alignment and
reducing random marketing efforts.
