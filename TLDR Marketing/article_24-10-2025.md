NEWS & TRENDS

 IT'S STILL 1995 (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI adoption is still in its earliest stage, comparable to the
internet in 1995, meaning there is a significant opportunity for new
companies to emerge. Despite the current surge in AI products, the
industry is likely only in the first inning of a decades-long cycle,
with 2025-2027 expected to produce many billion-dollar companies at
the application layer. Historical examples show that technology
adoption takes much longer than expected: e-commerce is still only 20%
of retail, 40% of companies are not fully cloud-based, and EVs make up
just 10% of new US car sales. Long-term value creation and durable
moats will matter more than rapid, unsustainable growth as AI
continues to mature. 

 WANT TO SHAPE CULTURE? STOP JUMPING ON TRENDS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Brands seeking cultural influence should stop chasing trends and
focus on setting them. Trend-jumping may bring short-term visibility,
but audiences, especially Gen Z, recognize inauthentic content and
quickly lose interest. Impact comes from a clear brand voice, purpose,
and perspective used to lead conversations. Thoughtful, original
social activations help brands stand out in a crowded digital
landscape. 

 BRANDS ARE PAYING MORE FOR ADS THAT DO LESS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ad budgets are rising faster than results. Shutterstock's 2025
Creative Impact Report shows a 33% jump in marketing spend but only a
17% lift in purchase intent since 2023. The widening 20% impact gap
signals a broken model, especially for brands leaning on high-volume
output. Today's environment demands carefully curated and culturally
aware creatives.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO FIX A BAD B2B NEWSLETTER (OR START A GREAT ONE) (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Most B2B newsletters fail because they're self-promotional or
irrelevant. A good newsletter builds trust, educates buyers, and
converts by delivering useful content to an engaged audience. Write
from a real person, focus on the reader's needs, solve problems, and
keep content skimmable with clear formatting and purposeful visuals.
Skip generic subject lines and hard sells and treat your offer like a
friendly postscript. Publish regularly, repurpose content, and promote
subscriptions across channels. 

 INTENT-BASED MARKETING TO GROW 50K SUBSCRIBERS IN 3 MONTHS (1 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Aimply Briefs grew its personalized AI-powered newsletter to 50K
subscribers in 3 months by using intent-based marketing. The team
targeted LinkedIn and Twitter threads where influencers offered lead
magnets, scraped lists of commenters showing interest, and sent
personalized emails offering a newsletter on that topic. As the
product could adapt to any interest, each thread became a source of
qualified leads, driving rapid subscriber growth and high engagement.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 SEOGETS (TOOL) [10] 

 SEOGets is an SEO analytics platform that expands Google Search
Console data, tracking up to 120K pages and providing up to 50X more
insights. It offers features like topic clustering, content-decay
heatmaps, cannibalization reports, branded keyword filters, and shared
dashboards with client portals. It serves as a more powerful
alternative to GSC with both free and paid plans. 

 TIP ON “PARTNERSHIPS” FEATURE FOR LINKEDIN ADS (1 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 The “Partnerships” feature helps brands find and promote relevant
posts for thought leadership campaigns. Located in the LinkedIn Ads'
dashboard, it displays posts mentioning a brand and allows promotion
requests directly from the interface. Posts can be filtered by media
type, date range, creator, or keyword, and searches can expand beyond
brand mentions to surface broader industry conversations. This tool
simplifies how marketers identify and boost quality content for
thought leadership ads. The feature is still rolling out, but it marks
a major upgrade for LinkedIn advertisers.

 MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL'S SOCIAL MEDIA PLAYBOOK (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 MLB's social content strategy is focused on making people fall in
love with the game. Its team blends fast-paced coverage with creative
storytelling, using each platform to show baseball's culture and
personality. They pull from pop culture, Reddit commentary, and player
reactions to deliver content that resonates. Their World Series plan
includes custom graphics, historic context, and a giveaway that puts
fan messages on game-used balls. This approach helps transform casual
viewers into loyal fans by making the sport feel both exciting and
personal. 

 BOOKTOK: A LITERARY MARKETING ECHO CHAMBER (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 BookTok has created an echo chamber in the literary world that
prioritizes marketability over originality. As authors tailor their
writing to mimic popular titles promoted through social media,
literary diversity and quality decline. The trend has major commercial
impact, with BookTok driving about 59 million US print book sales in
2025, up from 46 million in 2023, and accounting for 8% of all sales
in 2024. This cycle limits opportunities for new authors and narrows
readers' exposure to unique voices and challenging literature. 

 HOW MICROSOFT SAVED APPLE (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Microsoft's 1997 investment and settlement with Apple was less a
rescue and more a calculated strategy that benefited both companies.
Apple was losing $1 billion a year and had less than 90 days of cash,
but it used multiple patent lawsuits to pressure Microsoft into a
broader deal worth between $500 million and $2 billion in licensing
fees. The agreement included a $150 million equity investment,
cross-licensing of patents, guaranteed Microsoft Office support for
Mac, and dropped lawsuits that removed billions in potential
liabilities. The deal kept Apple alive long enough to launch the iMac
and later the iPhone, doubling its desktop market share from 5% to 10%
and setting the stage for it to become the world's most valuable
company.
