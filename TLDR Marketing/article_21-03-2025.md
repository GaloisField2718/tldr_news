STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DEEP DIVE: HOSTING A CONFERENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hosting a conference positions a brand as an industry leader by
controlling the narrative, attracting top experts, and driving
innovation. It creates strong networking opportunities and generates
positive brand associations that last beyond the event. Conferences
also provide valuable content for ongoing engagement and PR
opportunities, boosting visibility and credibility. Brands like Apple,
Notion, and HubSpot have used conferences to strengthen authority,
showcase products, and build engaged communities. 

 MARKETING PRIORITY PYRAMID (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Marketing fails when teams prioritize tactics over strategy. To fix
this, define your brand differentiation, ICP, pain points, and value
prop before crafting messaging. This foundation strengthens
copywriting, automation, team structure, and GTM motions, making
tactics more effective. A strong strategy creates a feedback loop that
continuously refines execution.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 FORCED CHOICES REVEAL MORE CUSTOMER INSIGHTS THAN RATINGS (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Traditional rating-based surveys, such as asking consumers how likely
they are to purchase a product or visit a restaurant, often produce
misleading results. These studies fail to account for real-world
trade-offs. Research shows that forcing respondents to prioritize
choices, such as ranking a movie among their top three weekend plans
or choosing between clear and conflicting options. This approach, used
in discrete choice models like MaxDiff and conjoint analysis, enhances
market research by identifying true consumer preferences rather than
hypothetical intentions. 

 STENCIL (TOOL) [9] 

 GetStencil is a fast and easy-to-use graphic design tool for creating
social media graphics, ads, and marketing visuals. Users can preview,
share, and schedule posts with Buffer, plus integrate with WordPress,
Dropbox, and more. Stencil streamlines content creation with high-res
downloads, filters, and browser extensions. 

 NEW WAYS TO COLLABORATE AND GET CREATIVE WITH GEMINI (3 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Gemini has launched Canvas, an interactive space for real-time
editing and coding, and Audio Overview, which transforms documents
into podcast-style discussions. Canvas streamlines writing and coding
by allowing users to refine drafts, adjust tone, and preview web app
prototypes. Developers can generate, edit, and test code within
Canvas, making collaboration seamless. Audio Overview converts files
into dynamic AI-hosted conversations, summarizing complex content for
easy listening.

 THE HIDDEN MATH OF CHURN: WHY YOU CAN'T SCALE PAST $1M (5 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Subscription businesses often fail to scale because they prioritize
growth over retention, not realizing that churn mathematically caps
their total user base and revenue potential. At a 20% monthly churn
rate, a company will lose 100% of its users within a year, making
sustainable scaling impossible without continuous and expensive
customer acquisition. Companies that optimize retention benefit from
extended growth cycles, greater valuation multiples, and increased
profitability, while those that ignore churn struggle to maintain a
growth trajectory. 

 THE MARKETING EFFICIENCY & ATTRIBUTION PLAYBOOK: WHAT TODAY'S CMOS
ARE TRACKING (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 CMOs prioritize volume metrics, such as pipeline, ARR, and MQLs,
rather than efficiency metrics like cost per opportunity or marketing
CAC. Larger companies track cost per dollar of pipeline, new logo
revenue, and expansion revenue, while smaller companies rely more on
inbound leads. Scaled companies use multi-touch attribution, combining
models to analyze the full customer journey and optimize investment.
Companies that track cost per revenue, not just cost per pipeline,
make better budget decisions and gain clearer insights into marketing
effectiveness.
