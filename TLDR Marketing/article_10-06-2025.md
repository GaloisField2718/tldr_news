NEWS & TRENDS

 THE ‘DEATH OF CREATIVITY'? AI JOB FEARS STALK ADVERTISING INDUSTRY
(5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AI is pushing major firms like WPP (the world's largest ad group) to
overhaul operations and invest heavily in tech to stay relevant as big
tech platforms like Meta and Google tighten their grip on the £45
billion UK ad market. Meta's plan to roll out AI tools that generate,
target, and optimize ads with minimal human input has sparked fears of
widespread job losses and the “death of creativity.” While WPP and
others argue AI eliminates tasks, not jobs, they are restructuring
teams, changing business models, and facing client pressure to cut
fees. 

 STATE OF THE CONSUMER 2025: WHEN DISRUPTION BECOMES PERMANENT (12
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 People today are still spending more time alone, prioritizing digital
convenience, and redefining what value means. Trust in institutions is
low, but digital platforms still shape buying choices. Gen Z is
emerging as a powerful force with distinct priorities, blending
financial anxiety with a willingness to spend. Local brands are
gaining preference over global ones. Consumers are making trade-offs
across categories, cutting back on groceries, apparel, or home goods
to splurge on dining, travel, or beauty.

PERPLEXITY SOURCE INFORMATION (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ChatGPT relies heavily on Wikipedia, which makes up 47.9% of its
citations. Perplexity favors Reddit at 46.7%. Google AI Overviews
shows a more balanced mix, citing Reddit (21%), YouTube (18.8%), and

 META SAYS LINK POSTS ON THREADS ARE SEEING BETTER PERFORMANCE (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Threads is now giving more visibility to link posts and Meta has
added link performance analytics to help users track traffic. Link
ranking has improved over the past month and link posts are now shown
more often in recommendations. Despite this, Meta's platforms still
heavily favor content that keeps users within the app - 97.3% of U.S.
Facebook post views don't include external links. Brands should be
cautious about relying on Threads for consistent referral traffic, as
Meta has a history of shifting its content priorities.
