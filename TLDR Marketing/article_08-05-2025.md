 APPLE TO ADD AI SEARCH PARTNERS TO SAFARI AS GOOGLE USAGE FALLS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple will soon include AI search engines like Perplexity and
Anthropic in Safari, though they will not replace Google as the
default for now. This comes as Safari searches declined for the first
time ever in April, signaling a user shift toward AI-driven tools for
information retrieval. 

 NETFLIX: UNVEILING OUR INNOVATIVE NEW TV EXPERIENCE (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Netflix is rolling out a new AI-powered search experience that uses
ChatGPT to offer conversational, natural-language recommendations
based on user preferences. Currently in beta for iOS users, the tool
lets users request content in casual phrases like “funny but not too
scary,” aiming to simplify content discovery. Gen AI will be used to
update title cards in users' preferred languages.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A BEHIND THE SCENES LOOK AT MKT1'S CONTENT STRATEGY (13 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 MKT1's lean content strategy treats content like a product, built on
guiding principles such as adding value, staying relevant, and being
willing to fail. Its foundation includes systems for ideation, content
pillars, layered resources, and a clear editorial voice, all
maintained by a minimal team. The strategy is designed to drive three
core perceptions: MKT1 as the most trusted B2B marketing guide,
marketing as a strategic function equal to product, and ecosystem
marketing plus account-driven GTM as key trends. MKT1 reinforces these
through consistent messaging across newsletters, podcasts, templates,
and events. Each piece of content fits into a broader plan that
balances topic breadth and depth while avoiding “random acts of
marketing.” 

 HOW SUPPORTLOGIC BUILT A 90-SECOND ACCOUNT INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM THAT'S
TRANSFORMING THEIR GTM MOTION (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SupportLogic built an internal AI-powered research workflow that cut
account research time from 45 minutes to under 90 seconds and reduced
costs from $12 to $0.30-$0.80 per run. The system integrates Zapier,
Perplexity, OpenAI, and Salesforce to create structured briefs with
business insights, messaging ideas, and buying signals. It started as
a BDR tool but now supports campaigns, enablement, and outbound
strategies across the GTM organization. Adoption increased because
outputs align with existing account planning formats, and results are
consistent regardless of who runs it. The system is fueling new
experiments in outbound messaging, buyer engagement, and CRM-driven
personalization. 

 INSIDE A HIGH VELOCITY SALES-ASSISTED GTM MOTION (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Pylon, a B2B support platform that competes with Zendesk, built a
lean, inbound-only sales model where each account executive runs the
full cycles without SDR support. Its strategy combines
demo-on-first-call scheduling, shared Slack channels with prospects,
and week-long trials into a streamlined experience that aims to close
deals in under six weeks. LinkedIn has become its top pipeline source,
fueled by founder-led “build in public” posts that drive demos and
create credibility in the B2B customer support market.
