NEWS & TRENDS

 AI 'WORKSLOP' IS PLAGUING AMERICAN COMPANIES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Last month, over 40% of full-time US employees received AI-generated
workslop - content that looks useful but fails to advance tasks. On
average, 15.4% of work qualifies as workslop, mostly exchanged between
peers, with 18% coming from direct reports to managers. Sending
workslop damages perceptions of colleagues, with roughly half seen as
less creative, capable, and reliable, 42% as less trustworthy, and 37%
as less intelligent. 

 WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT EVOLVING JOBS, IN-DEMAND SKILLS, AND STRATEGIC
MOVES IN THE AGE OF AI (7 MINUTE READ) [6]

jobs that didn't exist in 2000. About 85% of US professionals could
see a quarter of their skills reshaped by AI. 58% of marketing
professionals report AI is making them more efficient. There has been
a 140% increase in new skills added since 2018 and a 100% growth in AI
literacy this past year. Many are pivoting into flexible, high-impact
roles or self-employment, where 65% of US self-employed feel in
control of their careers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SIMPLE LINKEDIN ADS STRUCTURE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Set up 3 campaign groups: TOF, MOF, and BOF. TOF builds audiences
with thought-leader videos, normal videos, or single-image ads for
retargeting. MOF nurtures warm leads with zero-click ads, ungated case
studies, or video testimonials to build trust. BOF drives demos,
leads, or signups using single-image ads to lead forms, conversation
ads, or direct-to-calendar landing pages. Focus each campaign on one
objective and a single ideal customer profile to keep targeting
simple. 

 WHY DIFFERENTIATION IS KEY TO YOUR CONTENT AND HOW TO NAIL IT (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To create strong content, start by identifying unique qualities that
make you stand out and drive your top clients to buy, rather than
generic table stakes like “great service”. Form a small
cross-functional team, gather input from leaders, employees, and loyal
customers, and list all potential differentiators. Remove anything
common, expected, or boring, then narrow to 3 memorable
differentiators. Use these consistently across all content, including
blogs, newsletters, webinars, and social media by highlighting why
they matter, why generic traits do not, and how they impact clients,
applying them throughout the funnel from awareness to conversion.

 BUY IT IN CHATGPT (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ChatGPT's Instant Checkout lets users buy products directly in chat
from US Etsy sellers. Shopify merchants are coming soon. Single-item
purchases are currently supported, with multi-item carts planned.
ChatGPT acts as an AI agent, securely passing order, payment, and
shipping details to merchants, who handle fulfillment and customer
support. The system uses the open-sourced Agentic Commerce Protocol,
allowing merchants to work across platforms and payment processors
without changing their existing systems. 

 NEW GOOGLE POSTMASTER TOOLS FOCUS ON COMPLIANCE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google will deprecate version 1 of Postmaster Tools today, removing
the IP and Domain Reputation charts that gave marketers simple
deliverability indicators. The replacement in version 2 is the
Compliance Status dashboard, which uses green or red checks to show
whether a sending domain meets Gmail's standards. The dashboard covers
6 technical requirements, such as SPF, DKIM, DMARC, TLS, DNS records,
and one-click unsubscribe, as well as two behavioral measures:
user-reported spam rates below 0.3% and honoring unsubscribes within
48 hours.

 ENGAGEMENT-BASED ALGORITHMS ARE CAUSING SOCIAL DIVISION. IS THERE AN
ALTERNATIVE? (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Social media algorithms amplify emotional content, especially anger,
which spreads faster than joy and fuels division. This incentivizes
creators to produce outrage while platforms profit from engagement.
China counters this by promoting “positive energy” and
knowledge-sharing on Douyin, but similar government control in the
West would be biased and untrusted. Removing algorithms could reduce
amplification but would hurt platform engagement and revenue. 

 HOW ADVERTISING EVOLVED SINCE THE FIRST TV AD (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Advertising has evolved from rational product demos in the 1960s to
jingles, celebrity glamour, quirky storytelling, relatable brand
characters, and cinematic, emotional campaigns. The 2020s began with
covid-era “sadvertising” but shifted back to culturally relevant,
emotionally resonant work. Across decades, the constant is that
effective ads connect meaningfully with audiences and evoke emotion. 

 HOW THE SWEDISH DESIGN MAVERICKS BUILT A $25M+ CULT FOLLOWING BY
BREAKING ALL THE RULES OF TECH MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Teenage Engineering built a $25M+ business by positioning itself as
an anti-brand brand that values emotion and experience over technical
specifications. It targets design-conscious tech enthusiasts,
professional musicians, and social media creators. Its marketing
relies on distinctive product design, organic social media exposure,
and collaborations with brands like IKEA, Nothing, and Panic Inc. It
has created a devoted global community and redefined what professional
creative tools can look like.
