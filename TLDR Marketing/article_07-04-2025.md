NEWS & TRENDS

 TRUMP EXTENDS US TIKTOK SELL-OFF DEADLINE ONCE AGAIN (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Trump has granted a second 75-day extension to TikTok's US sell-off
deadline despite the app technically being banned under existing law.
The proposed deal would spin off TikTok's US operations while leasing
its algorithm. The new ownership structure would leave ByteDance with
a 19.9% stake. China has already rejected the terms. 

 META, AMAZON, AND LOTS OF TECH FIRMS WILL BE INDIRECTLY HARMED BY
TARIFFS, TOO (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tariffs targeting Chinese imports won't hit digital goods directly,
but they're already impacting digital advertising. Meta, Amazon, and
Google are expected to lose ad revenue as Chinese advertisers retreat
amid new 54% tariffs. Meta alone generates an estimated $10B from
foreign advertisers targeting US users, much of it from China.

 HOW WIZ ACCIDENTALLY CREATED A VIRAL MARKETING ENGINE WITH $0 BUDGET
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Wiz launched a fake toy store called "CISOtopia" for cybersecurity
professionals on April Fools' Day 2023. It attracted 46K+ visitors in
24 hours and reached Reddit's homepage with 500K views. Over 3.5K
people tried to buy the fictional toys, and more than 10 CISOs shared
it organically. The campaign's success pointed to a clear marketing
approach - use a familiar format tailored to a niche audience with
insider humor. 

 MATURITY FRAMEWORKS: A HIDDEN GEM IN YOUR GTM STRATEGY (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Maturity models help companies shift from product feature selling to
value-based conversations by outlining clear stages of customer growth
and business outcomes. When used properly, they drive executive
engagement, improve cross-team alignment, and become powerful demand
generation tools. Case studies from BEA Systems, MeridianLink, and
Marketo show that maturity frameworks can increase qualified leads,
accelerate adoption, and deepen C-suite conversations. Companies using
this approach report 35% higher average contract value, 30% shorter
sales cycles, and double the likelihood of account expansion.

PRESENTATION (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Spotify is expanding its ad tools with the full launch of its ad
exchange, SAX, which supports programmatic buying of audio, video, and

Traffic Objectives. 

 YOUR PMM PROMOTION PLAYBOOK - PART 2 (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Performance alone isn't enough to get promoted in product marketing -
you need strategy, visibility, and timing. Build influence by mapping
key stakeholders, understanding their goals, and aligning your work to
solve their problems. Actively share your impact throughout projects
using a structured "socialization strategy." Don't wait for review
time - promotion decisions are made months in advance, so align with
your manager early and regularly. When you ask, back it with proof,
timing it around major wins or new responsibilities to strengthen your
case.

 HOW SAAS COMPANIES WIN BY PACKAGING SERVICES (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The challenge today is no longer what a software can do, but whether
customers can implement it effectively. Bardeen, an AI automation
tool, addressed this by narrowing its focus to GTM teams and embedding
service hours into its pricing. Its “AIgency” model includes three
to seven annual service hours per tier, helping users build custom
workflows quickly. A guided 14-day trial with human support turned
into an effective onboarding period, leading to a 100% conversion
rate.
