NEWS & TRENDS

 TRUST'S IMPACT ON CONSIDERATION AND SPEND (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Trust is a key factor that influences how consumers consider and
spend on brands, ranking second only to price. New research found that
59% of consumers say trust is vital in persuading them to consider a
product or service, and 92% will take action if they trust a brand,
with 74% willing to spend more. Losing trust has major consequences,
as 60% of consumers who stopped using a brand did so due to a lack of
trust. Reliability is the strongest pillar of trust (35%), followed by
Reciprocity (19%) and Aligned Interests (14%). 

 CAPTURING COMMUNITIES WITH SPECIALIST MAGS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Publishers are reviving specialist magazines that build strong reader
communities and reflect public interests. Hearst, for example, has
shifted from subscriptions to a membership model, creating forums and
perks that foster belonging and real engagement. This sense of
community distinguishes a brand from a product and strengthens
advertising potential. The industry is becoming smarter at responding
to active communities, embracing one-shots, bookazines, and niche
fandoms to reach highly engaged audiences.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AIROPS' BEST GROWTH CHANNEL = WEBINARS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AirOps has turned webinars into its top growth channel by focusing on
education, not product pitches. Each session features experts sharing
real tactics on SEO and AI search, delivering substance instead of
sales. The team repurposes every webinar into dozens of content pieces
shared across multiple channels. This approach has shortened
enterprise sales cycles from months to weeks. By teaching openly and
offering value first, AirOps positions itself as a credible guide. 

 WHY ARE FREE USERS CHURNING? A GROWTH LEADER'S 5-STEP GUIDE TO
AUDITING THE FREE USER EXPERIENCE (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Free user churn in SaaS often starts long before conversion
decisions. This five-step audit framework involves analyzing user data
for drop-offs, interviewing both active and churned users, mapping
competitor offerings, scoring product actions by friction level, and
connecting these insights to find and fix friction points. This
process reveals where users lose interest, which features fail to
drive value, and where gates or limits appear too early. When done
correctly, it helps create data-driven retention strategies that boost
activation, engagement, and long-term conversions. 

 DEDICATED PAGE FOR AI AGENTS/LLMS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Wynter created a dedicated page for AI agents to scrape accurate
information about its product. The page should be simple, factual, and
crawlable, outlining what the product does, who it serves, key
features, and pricing. Including a short “how to reference us”
section further guides AI summaries.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 THE B2B BUYING EXPERIENCE WITH AI: WHAT CHANGES? (WEBINAR) [9] 

 As buyers use AI to research, compare, and decide before speaking
with sales, marketing teams must adapt strategies, KPIs, and
structures. This session will discuss faster buyer behavior, the
merging of marketing and sales, and how “AI-readiness” is becoming
central to GTM strategy. It's free to register and will take place on
October 30 at 10 AM PDT. 

 TALLY (TOOL) [10] 

 Tally.so is a no-code form builder that functions like writing a
document. Questions and blocks can be added for text, files, payments,
or signatures. It supports forms, surveys, quizzes, and checkout
pages. Compared to Google Forms, Tally offers greater design control,
conditional logic, and integrations. It also allows unlimited forms
and responses, even on the free plan.

 DO MORE LIKES LEAD TO MORE CLICKS? (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Evidence shows that social cues like ‘likes' influence user
behavior in advertising. The first like enhances both credibility and
engagement, while subsequent likes mainly reinforce social conformity.
Platforms that display like counts in ads may see varying impacts
based on campaign type. In click-driven campaigns, excessive like
counts may reduce informational influence. In brand awareness efforts,
larger like totals may support perceived popularity. 

 YOUR PRICING IS (PROBABLY) BROKEN (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Most pricing models have limitations, but a full overhaul is usually
unnecessary. Flat-rate pricing restricts expansion, seat-based models
lose effectiveness in leaner, AI-driven teams, and usage-based pricing
introduces forecasting challenges. Hybrid approaches can offer
flexibility but often add complexity for both buyers and internal
teams. Many companies address these issues by layering in premium
tiers, usage thresholds, admin controls, and aligning incentives with
realized usage. In enterprise settings, usage-based expansion can be
successfully added to core pricing to increase wallet share.
