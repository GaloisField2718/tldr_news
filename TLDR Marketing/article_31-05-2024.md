recommend an action in the user's physical environment, and embedding

 KLARNA CEO FACES BACKLASH FOR SAYING AI LET MARKETING TEAM 'HALF THE
SIZE IT WAS LAST YEAR' DO MORE WORK, SAVING MILLIONS (3 MINUTE READ)
[5]

assistant also handles tasks equivalent to 700 full-time agents and
produces 80% of the company's copywriting. Despite the efficiencies,
his remarks sparked criticism on social media, with commenters saying

 WHEN SHOULD YOUR BRAND GO DARK ON SOCIAL MEDIA? (3 MINUTE READ) [8]

communication in place to determine when it is appropriate for your
brand to start posting again. This author shares his strategy of using
