 ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T PAY THE BILLS. CONNECT MARKETING EFFORT TO REVENUE
WITH ASANA (SPONSOR) [4]

you're actually moving the needle on revenue.

here's the good news: There's a way to do more with less, and it's

NEWS & TRENDS

 WHEN CONSUMERS ARE FINANCIALLY STRESSED, THEY LOOK FOR RELIABILITY (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Financial stress is reshaping how consumers evaluate brands. A recent
study found that only 52% of consumers feel financially secure, and
those who feel insecure are more risk-averse and less tolerant of
friction. These consumers rate brand experiences lower on satisfaction
and trust, prioritizing reliability and recommendations over price. In
uncertain economic conditions, trust reduces decision fatigue and
becomes a key driver of loyalty. 

 AT CES 2026, MARKETERS GET SERIOUS ABOUT AGENTIC AI, CREATORS, AND
RETAIL MEDIA (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CES 2026 showed a shift from flashy technology to practical execution
in marketing. Agentic AI gained momentum as it moves toward automated
media buying while requiring trust and transparency. Creators are
evolving into full media businesses as they expand into streaming and
podcasting and gain pricing power. SiriusXM saw a 300% increase in
podcast revenue as creators adopted omnichannel distribution and
programmatic access. Retail media growth now depends on off-site
investment and consistent measurement, as return on ad spend (ROAS)
varies by as much as 63% across networks.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 VENMO MARKETING STRATEGY: GROWTH TACTICS ON HOW THEY MADE P2P
PAYMENTS SOCIAL (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Venmo grew by making payments social, so the interaction mattered
more than the transaction. It targeted millennials and Gen Z, ages 18
to 40, and positioned itself as a social payment app built around a
feed and emojis. Visible transactions created built-in virality. Each
payment acted as a micro-advertisement. The brand's scale and cultural
relevance are reinforced by its influencer campaigns and partnerships
on social platforms. 

 THE STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS BEHIND OUR 2025 WRAPPED EMAIL (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 EmailLove's 2025 Wrapped email followed a 7-step process. It started
by auditing data and defining an active-user segment, then cleaning
and uploading it as custom fields in MailerLite. The email was
designed, merge tags were tested, and it was sent to around 1,000
users. It reached a 57% open rate with no unsubscribes or spam
complaints, but generated no clicks. Adding CTAs, share options,
personality labels, or interactive elements could turn passive stats
into engagement. 

 HOW TO CONVERT FREE USERS INTO PAYING SUBSCRIBERS (2 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Apps should combine a free install with onboarding that highlights
user pain points, shows the solution, and provides social proof. After
this, a hard paywall requires commitment to a three-day free trial
before access, with the option to cancel anytime. This filters out
less serious users, while soft paywalls let interest fade and reduce
sign-ups.

 GMAIL IS ENTERING THE GEMINI ERA (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Gmail is moving deeper into AI assistance with the launch of
Gemini-powered features designed to reduce inbox friction. AI
Overviews summarize long threads and answer natural-language questions
by synthesizing information across years of emails, removing the need
for keyword searches or manual scanning. At the same time, writing
tools like Help Me Write and upgraded Suggested Replies focus on speed
and tone alignment, positioning Gmail as an active writing
collaborator.

 AI WRITES BRILLIANTLY (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI writes well and can match a writer's voice, but it also creates
too many strong versions. Combining them becomes a slow, clumsy
process that often feels worse than starting fresh. The unused lines
make it easy to doubt every choice. The real lesson is simple. Pick
one good draft, call it done, and move on. 

 WE BUILT HELL, THEN ASKED FOR A DISCOUNT (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Humans want fast and high-quality experiences. They create systems
that deliver short-term ease while ignoring long-term tradeoffs. When
friction or failure appears, they blame others instead of recognizing
the choices that caused it. This cycle repeats across industries and
history, from health insurance and travel to government and social
media. People end up paying a misery premium for experiences they
designed themselves, and the pattern shows no sign of stopping.
