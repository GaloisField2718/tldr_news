MINUTE READ) [4]

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY DIPS (DIAGNOSE → PROBLEM → SOLUTION) THRASHES MEEK TWEAKING
(5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Small, arbitrary changes (like button color tweaks) in A/B testing
waste time and rarely yield meaningful results. A 10% conversion
improvement can take months to detect, while an 80% improvement is
measurable in just two days. Bold, targeted changes generate larger,
faster results and keep teams motivated. Successful marketing follows
the Diagnose–Problem–Solution (DiPS) approach, identifying
specific visitor objections and addressing them directly. Top
marketers avoid "best practice" clutter and instead craft content and
funnels that respond to user needs at every step.

 MARKETING 101: WHAT BRAND TRUMP DID RIGHT THAT BRAND HARRIS DIDN'T (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Democrats lost the 2024 election despite outspending Republicans by
$400 million on ads due to poor marketing strategy. Brand Harris
suffered from low brand awareness and negative associations
transferred from Brand Biden, which hurt its appeal to undecided swing
voters focused on the economy and inflation. Effective political
marketing requires segmenting voters based on needs, not demographics,
and positioning the brand as the best solution to those needs. The
campaign failed to build a distinct, compelling brand that resonated
with swing voters' immediate concerns. 

 PREVALENCE AND PATTERNS OF SOCIAL MEDIA USE IN EARLY ADOLESCENTS (13
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Social media use often starts before the age of 13, with 42% of
children aged 9-12 having Facebook accounts in 2013-2014. Among
adolescents aged 11-15, 69.5% have at least one social media account,
with Instagram (66%) and YouTube (64.7%) being the most popular
platforms. Girls report higher usage and more problematic behaviors,
such as addiction-like tendencies, compared to boys. Unregulated
access to social media during early adolescence has been linked to
poor sleep, substance use, and cyberbullying.
