NEWS & TRENDS

 CPC INFLATION: HOW FAST ARE GOOGLE ADS COSTS RISING? (8 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 CPC inflation is real, but its magnitude depends on the data source:
Google's official stats suggest muted increases, while account-level
data reveals double-digit annual growth in sectors like legal and
travel. WordStream's industry benchmarks, adjusted for anomalies, show
that 52% of sectors now experience CPC growth exceeding the 4.24% US
inflation rate. 

 YOUTUBE'S CROSS-PLATFORM TAKEOVER IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON CREATORS (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 YouTube's push into connected TV and Shorts is forcing creators to
manage both high-cost, long-form “TV-style” content and
less-monetizable short-form videos. YouTube now dominates TV
viewership and is leaning into episodic formats. Creators say Shorts
boost reach, but don't deliver strong revenue or deep audience bonds.
Brands like Jones Road are treating YouTube more like a storytelling
platform than a profit driver, often needing sponsors to fund
production. Meanwhile, competition from TV networks and costly
production is squeezing creators trying to keep up across formats. 

 OPENAI'S REPORTEDLY EXPLORING ITS OWN AI-BASED SOCIAL NETWORK (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is reportedly developing a social media app potentially
integrated with ChatGPT centered around image generation. The app
could help OpenAI collect real-time content, similar to Musk's
xAI-Grok setup with X.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ANSWER ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (AEO) IS THE NEW SEO (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Instead of targeting individual keywords, AEO focuses on clusters of
related questions with similar intent, creating pages that address
hundreds of them at once. Like traditional SEO, only a small
percentage of strategies drive meaningful impact. The emphasis should
be on testing, validating, and reproducing high-performing tactics
rather than wasting time on technical audits or vanity metrics. With
AI chat interfaces now displaying links and driving traffic, brands
can influence these answers if they focus on product-related
questions, create content that fills key gaps, and optimize for
visibility in citations used by LLMs. 

 STEAL THESE BRILLIANT GROWTH TACTICS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article shows how startups are experimenting across pricing,
onboarding, user engagement, and GTM roles. Lovable's “Launched”
platform creates a loop of user-generated content and product exposure
by embedding editing CTAs in community-submitted apps. FirmPilot
defines the emerging “GTM Engineer” role to drive sales-assisted
growth through automation, experimentation, and buyer journey
optimization. Decagon introduced dual pricing options (per
conversation or per resolution) to align AI agent costs with perceived
value.

 NO ONE CARES: WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM LIQUID DEATH'S UK DEMISE (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Liquid Death's exit from the UK was not a branding failure but a move
driven by reduced margins after shifting manufacturing to the US.
Despite generating over $2M in its first year with minimal marketing,
the brand lacked the local foundation it had in the US. Entering
retail without established demand weakened its impact. Branding alone
was not enough. Product, pricing, placement, and promotion all matter.
Brands should be built for real consumers, not for industry buzz or
creative recognition alone. 

 ATTIO'S AI STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Attio positions itself as the first truly AI-native CRM, branding its
platform as an intelligent command center rather than a passive data
tool. It differentiates from legacy CRMs by embedding AI into its core
architecture, enabling fluid, context-rich automation across
workflows. By combining structured CRM data with unstructured inputs
like calls and emails, it delivers a level of contextual intelligence
that reinforces its role as the operational heart of GTM teams.
Attio's focus on seamless, delightful user experiences—through
features like self-naming workflows and smart email
handling—strengthens its identity as a product built for the modern,
AI-powered era.
