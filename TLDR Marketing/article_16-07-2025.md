NEWS & TRENDS

 INVISIBLE INFLUENCE: UNLOCKING THE POWER OF HIDDEN BUYERS (11 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Hidden buyers are internal stakeholders who are not end users but
still influence purchase decisions. They play a crucial and often
overlooked role in B2B deals. These buyers are just as engaged as
target buyers, with 64% spending over an hour a week on thought
leadership and 55% using it to vet vendors. Yet 71% have little or no
direct interaction with sales. High-quality, insight-driven content
helps build trust and can turn skeptics into advocates. It also
encourages hidden buyers to support lesser-known brands during final
decisions. 

 PLASTIC PACKAGING TURNS OFF SHOPPERS, BUT NOT ALWAYS BECAUSE OF THE
ENVIRONMENT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 New research finds that 37% of North American shoppers and 42% of
European shoppers have avoided purchases due to plastic packaging.
While some of this behavior ties to sustainability, many consumers are
motivated by personal health concerns such as the threat of
microplastics. Only 57% of North American respondents who think brands
overuse packaging link it to climate change, suggesting plastic
concerns may be shifting away from climate conversations. 

 SIRIUS, LONG COMMERCIAL-FREE IN CARS, IS BETTING ON ADVERTISING TO
CAPTURE NEW LISTENERS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SiriusXM is launching a cheaper, ad-supported subscription plan
called SiriusXM Play, priced under $7 per month, to attract
cost-conscious users and convert more free trial drivers into paying
customers. The plan includes limited ads and access to over 130
channels, but premium content like Howard Stern and live sports
remains exclusive to ad-free subscribers. SiriusXM ended Q1 with 33
million subscribers, a loss of 303,000, and reported a 4%
year-over-year drop in revenue to $2.07 billion. The company is
shifting focus to in-car services and ad revenue, which totaled $1.8
billion in 2024 despite a soft ad market.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NEWSLETTER MARKETING 101 (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To help legacy media companies grow paid digital subscribers, focus
on turning their large, passive audiences into engaged email
subscribers. Start by retargeting warm website and social traffic with
Meta ads that promote locally relevant newsletter content, aiming for
sub-$1 acquisition costs. Use tools like SparkLoop or Upscribe to earn
back part of that cost through paid newsletter recommendations. Once
someone signs up, offer a low-cost, time-limited subscription trial
(e.g. $1/month for 3 months) to convert readers into paying customers.


 HOW TO BUILD A CUSTOMER-FOCUSED CONTENT STRATEGY (16 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Start by mapping content to buyer awareness stages, beginning from
Most Aware to Unaware, using formats that reflect each stage's intent.
Source content ideas from customer questions, analytics, Reddit
threads, and competitor wins and losses, then prioritize by business
alignment, search intent, and differentiation. Back each piece with a
detailed brief containing research, visuals, and a repurposing plan.
Handle promotion through email, social posts, and curated roundups to
increase reach. Track results using engagement and ROI metrics tied to
funnel stages. Long-term success is driven by consistent, insight-rich
execution.

 AI CODING TOOLS ARE SHIFTING TO A SURPRISING PLACE: THE TERMINAL (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI coding tools are shifting from code editors to the terminal, as
agentic AI grows more capable and developers seek deeper system-level
interactions. Tools like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and CLI Codex
reflect this change. Leading companies are quietly prioritizing
command-line interfaces. Unlike traditional code assistants focused on
fixing code, terminal-based tools address broader tasks like system
setup and debugging. With rising skepticism around code editors'
actual productivity gains, terminal-first environments like Warp are
emerging as a more versatile alternative.

 KELLOGG'S CEREAL: A STORY OF MISSED STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Kellogg's $3 billion sale to Ferrero marks the decline of a brand
that once led the cereal aisle but failed to adapt to changing
consumer habits. While General Mills leaned into whole grains and
wellness trends, Kellogg's remained focused on sugary cereals tied to
outdated consumption patterns. The company found growth in snacks and
spun those assets into Kellanova, which Mars acquired for $30 billion.
Still, Kellogg's missed adjacent opportunities in health and breakfast
by failing to revisit its core value proposition. 

 FRANKENSTEIN AI AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE GTM PLAYBOOK (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 B2B go-to-market teams are overloaded with tools but lack clear
strategy, leading to stalled pipeline growth and ineffective systems.
Many teams rely on fragile tech stacks patched together without
orchestration, mistaking automation for progress. Most teams fail to
define meaningful buyer signals and instead chase engagement metrics
or generic intent data. AI tools alone won't drive pipeline without a
cohesive, signal-first system. Marketing leaders must shift from
campaign execution to GTM system design that spans product, sales, and
client success.
