NEWS & TRENDS

 2025 INFLUENCER MARKETING REPORT: TRENDS AND STATISTICS FOR
INFLUENCER MARKETING, UGC, AND THE CREATOR ECONOMY (17 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 The influencer marketing industry is projected to reach $22.2B this
year. More brands are leveraging UGC and everyday creators. TikTok and
Instagram remain dominant, with TikTok's audience expanding beyond Gen
Z. Brands are spending less per collaboration due to an influx of new
creators. AI influencers are gaining traction, and male creators
continue to earn more on average. The US leads in influencer
campaigns, while markets like the UAE and the Netherlands are growing.


 TARIFFS WON'T PUT AN END TO THE TEMU AND SHEIN MODEL (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 New tariffs and the closure of a trade loophole may raise costs for
Temu and Shein, but they won't end their business model. The ability
to ship directly from Chinese factories to US shoppers offers a faster
cash flow cycle, which remains attractive to manufacturers looking to
offload inventory quickly. While tariffs could increase prices
slightly, experts say the factory-direct model still holds strong
advantages over traditional retail.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW HIGHLIGHTING A SIMPLE QUIZ BOOSTED SUBSCRIPTIONS BY 34% (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Seamwork increased memberships by 34% and revenue per visitor by 56%
by making its quiz the first thing new visitors saw. User research
revealed that visitors disliked early subscription prompts but enjoyed
taking the quiz. The quiz provided tailored sewing advice in exchange
for an email, creating engagement without a hard sell. This approach
built relationships instead of pushing sales, leading to higher
conversions. 

 6-STEP FORMULA TO A BILLION VIEWS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Billion View Formula is a structured approach to viral video
creation that emphasizes hooks that retain viewers, storytelling
techniques that build suspense, and engagement tactics that encourage
interaction. By incorporating high-stakes elements like unexpected
locations, props, and casting choices, videos can captivate larger
audiences. Boost performance further by using split testing variations
with small ad budgets before publishing on primary channels.

more actionable. These AI prompts can help anticipate objections,

 DEEP DIVE: FENTY BEAUTY (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Fenty Beauty launched in 2017 to address the lack of inclusivity in
the beauty industry, offering 50 foundation shades and setting a new
standard. It is valued at $2.8 billion and leverages Rihanna's massive
social media presence, with 90% of her audience under 35. The brand's
success stems from innovation, accessibility, and cultural impact, not
just celebrity hype. Viral campaigns like the #FentyFace Challenge and
Rihanna's 2023 Super Bowl product placement reinforced its dominance.
Fenty Beauty forced competitors to prioritize diversity, proving that
authenticity and inclusivity drive long-term success. 

 HOW GOAL DILUTION KILLS YOUR BRAND'S BELIEVABILITY (AND HOW TO AVOID
IT) (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Larry Page and Sergey Brin created Google in 1998 with a unique
search algorithm called PageRank that ranked web pages based on the
quality and number of links pointing to them. Unlike other search
engines that cluttered their sites with multiple features, Google
focused solely on search, reinforcing its credibility. This strategy
aligned with the psychological principle of goal dilution, which
states that brands claiming to do too many things become less
believable. Companies should avoid goal dilution by prioritizing a
single goal and ensuring all messaging supports it. Consistent
messaging across all channels strengthens a brand's credibility and
prevents customers from receiving mixed signals. 

 HOW TO HANDLE MARKETING REQUESTS FROM OTHER TEAMS (6 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Marketing teams should prioritize requests by understanding the
"request behind the request" to determine actual needs. Setting clear
marketing goals and sharing them prevents ad hoc requests from
derailing planned work. A structured request intake process, including
a standardized form, ensures requests are properly evaluated.
Prioritization should be based on factors like the requester, impact
on key goals, and alignment with revenue levers. Regularly reviewing
and communicating request statuses helps maintain efficiency and
transparency.
