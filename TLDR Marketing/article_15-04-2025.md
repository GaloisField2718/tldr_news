 GENERATION ZEITGEIST - TAKING THE SOCIAL PULSE OF GEN Z (6 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Gen Z makes up one-third of the global population and has already
surpassed boomers in earning power by age 25 in the US. They use
social media to communicate, explore culture, and discover products.
67% share videos from Meta platforms with others and 78% say video is
their top way to discover brands. 71% are open to AI-generated replies
from businesses and expect fast, personalized interactions. They
prefer short-form, niche video and actively shape their feeds.

travel experiences. Social media platforms are now the primary source

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 14 SAAS RENEWAL EMAIL TEMPLATES YOU CAN STEAL (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SaaS renewal emails prevent churn, failed payments, and surprise
charges. They remind users of product value, upsell or downgrade
plans, and maintain customer trust. Automated reminders sent days or
weeks before renewal can reduce user drop-off, especially for annual
plans where surprise charges can trigger cancellations. Personalizing
these emails and including options like one-click renewals, plan
upgrades, or small discounts can improve retention. 

 6 SECTIONS OF A GOOD LINKEDIN CAROUSEL (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 For LinkedIn carousels, use 1080x1350px slides (10–15 total), focus
on one clear topic, and write simply. Start with a bold cover, add
context with real examples, break down one specific problem or
process, show results with proof, recap key takeaways, and end with a
CTA. Use tools like Canva or Figma, write at a 5th-grade level, and
structure your content using the “How I…” format to keep it
relatable and actionable.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 LINK BUILDING TRENDS REPORT (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 61% of organizations manage link building in-house, but only 29%
consider their efforts successful. Over 50% expect budget increases,
but only 12% find it easy to get more funding. Most teams focus on
content pages, not sales or product pages. Only 40% feel confident in
their reporting, and benchmarking remains underused. Many still
operate without a clear strategy or long-term plan, with pressure to
show results in under 6 months. 

 LINKEDIN LAUNCHES NEW MINI-SITE OF POSTING TIPS (2 MINUTE READ) [10]

content types. The platform has released a new mini-site featuring
content strategy tips, video guidelines, and best practices for
creators. The site breaks down post fundamentals and links to
additional training to help professionals better tailor their content.

 WHY DOES B2B SAAS MARKETING FEEL LIKE THE GRAVEYARD OF GOOD IDEAS? (4
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 VC-backed B2B SaaS companies often undermine brand marketing by
prioritizing short-term growth and ROI over long-term brand-building.
This leads to internal contradictions and underfunded efforts. Brand
work relies on emotional resonance and consistent storytelling, which
doesn't align with VC incentives focused on speed and quick investor
returns. This misalignment makes it difficult for marketers to thrive,
not because of a lack of skill, but because they're working in a
structure that doesn't support the value they bring. 

 LLMS DON'T REWARD ORIGINALITY, THEY FLATTEN IT (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Originality isn't rewarded until it's repeated in AI-first search.
Unique ideas must gain traction across multiple sources before LLMs
recognize or surface them. Without clear labeling, plain-language
definitions, and off-site mentions, even strong concepts risk
invisibility in zero-click summaries. 

 WHAT THE BEST ADS OF THE 2000S REVEAL ABOUT AMERICAN CULTURE (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In the 2000s, advertising often referenced fine art, like Ellen
DeGeneres' Botticelli-inspired poster or Scion's Damien Hirst homage.
Jim Heimann, editor of All-American Ads of the 2000s, believes the
rise of digital ads led to a drop in creativity, replacing visually
bold print with simpler, cheaper formats. His book explores how tech,
sexuality, and cultural shifts shaped that decade's campaigns. Heimann
also questions how AI, economic shifts, and political changes will
affect the future of ad-making.
