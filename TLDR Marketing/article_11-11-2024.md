STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MARKETING TEARDOWN: OWNING A HOLIDAY (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Brands can benefit from "owning" holidays that align with their
products or values. Successful campaigns require creativity and
long-term commitment. For example, Nathan's Famous solidified the
company's association with the Fourth of July through a hot dog eating
contest now linked with summer and patriotism. Domino's capitalized on
Super Bowl Sunday for increased orders but competes with Little
Caesar's, the NFL's "official pizza."

cultural events to elevate its presence in fashion and sports.
Partnerships with high-profile figures like Charli XCX and Team USA
athletes showcase the brand's commitment to inclusivity and diverse
representation. Skims' influencer marketing program also amplifies its
brand reach, utilizing social media whitelisting to drive relatability
and authenticity. 

 DON'T LET GENERIC CTAS HURT YOUR CONVERSION (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When creating CTAs, add social proof, such as "Join 70,000+
creators." Address objections by saying, "Try X in 5 minutes." Offer
something free, like "Get the first chapter free." Clarify the value,
for example, "Get a free 15-min consult." Specify the next action,
such as "Take a 2-min tour." Avoid generic CTAs to boost conversions.

 THE MARKETING PLAYBOOK FOR A CIRCULAR ECONOMY (30 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Circular economies are based on three principles: eliminating waste
and pollution, circulating products and materials, and regenerating
nature. For marketers, circular business models offer a way to build
brand differentiation, especially in mature markets where brand growth
is currently fought for, often via small incremental additions to
products. Marketers should move from one-off pilots towards core
circular revenue generation models, from transactional towards
long-lasting customer-brand relationships, from niche towards
mass-market appeal, and from sales-driven KPIs towards value-focused
outcomes.

 THE $1,000 COLD EMAIL ALTERNATIVE THAT'S BREAKING B2B SALES (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 With a 1% success rate in cold email outreach and high LinkedIn ad
costs, the new “pay-per-pitch” trend - where companies pay
prospects for meetings - promises a nearly 100% engagement rate.
Yotpo's viral $1,000 intro offer exemplifies this approach, trading ad
budgets for guaranteed attention and stronger trust. This method is
reshaping B2B sales as companies prioritize direct compensation for
engagement over traditional, less effective channels.

MINUTE READ) [12] 

 TV advertising remains valuable for driving web traffic. Research by
the Video Advertising Bureau (VAB) showed that 931 first-time
advertisers collectively invested over $4 billion since 2021, with
brands seeing an average 12% increase in website traffic during their
debut month and sustained growth of 20%. Direct-to-consumer brands
stood out, achieving an average increase of 622K unique monthly
visitors, and brands spending over $10 million saw a 36% initial boost
and 42% sustained growth. Although first-time advertisers typically
increased their spending after initial campaigns, the rate of growth
in investments decreased each year.
