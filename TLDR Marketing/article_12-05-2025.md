NEWS & TRENDS

 COMPANIES ARE TURNING TRUMP'S TARIFFS INTO A MARKETING OPPORTUNITY (7
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Consumers are looking for pre-tariff deals. Brands are using looming
tariffs as a sales trigger, launching “pre-tariff” deals and
urgent promotions to drive purchases before potential price hikes.
From cheeky discount codes to transparent pricing breakdowns, they're
using humor and urgency to connect with anxious consumers. While some
highlight American-made products, others rush to offload inventory or
secure short-term revenue to prepare for supply chain disruptions. 

 INFLUENCER REVEALS 88% OF CREATORS STILL OPERATE AS SIDE HUSTLERS
DESPITE INDUSTRY GROWTH (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While 72% of creators are optimistic about their platforms, 88% still
treat content creation as a side hustle. Only 25% of top-tier creators
do it full-time. Tension with brands often stems from mismatched
expectations around creativity, deadlines, and revisions. Although 58%
of creators prefer having brand guidelines, many want more
collaboration and clarity. Brands should share broader marketing
objectives, not just campaign-specific goals. Creators care whether a
brand is not just looking for story clicks, brand uplifts, or saves.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE "EVIL GENIUS" WAY TO STEAL CUSTOMERS FROM COMPETITORS (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Companies are using SEO to target people searching for competitor
discounts by creating fake coupon pages or "how to pay less" pages.
These pages rank for keywords like “[Competitor] discount” and
redirect high-intent buyers to their own products. Brands like
Speechify, BlueNotary, and Splashtop use this tactic to poach
customers who are ready to buy. To defend against this, companies
should create their own discount pages to rank higher than both
competitors and coupon sites. 

 AD STRENGTH IN GOOGLE ADS: WHY AVERAGE IS BETTER THAN EXCELLENT (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ad strength in Google Ads is not a reliable performance metric and
should not be blindly optimized for. While ads rated Excellent by
Google can lead to a 12% increase in conversions, real-world data
shows that both Poor and Excellent rated ads often perform worse than
Average or Good ones. Completely unpinned headlines, which Google
requires for Excellent ratings, tend to lower ad relevance and
increase CPCs. Advertisers like Nike and Best Buy pin keyword-rich
headlines to improve performance, even if it means settling for lower
ad strength scores.

 OPTIMIZELY: WHERE TODAY'S TEST DRIVES TOMORROW'S REVENUE (VIRTUAL
EVENT) [10] 

 Optimizely is hosting a free online event, Test + Learn, where
experts will discuss how they turn experimentation into a
revenue-driving function with AI and unified analytics as their
co-pilots. The event takes place on May 21 at 10 am ET. 

 GOOGLE DISCOVER ON DESKTOP (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google is expanding Google Discover to desktop. It's offering
businesses new ways to reach users with curated, interest-based
content without requiring search queries. Discover currently drives
25.7% of referral traffic, up from 22.8%. Its users spend 8 seconds
more on content compared to traditional search. News publishers
dominate the platform with 99% of clicks, while ecommerce and B2C
brands also see strong results through product pages and visual
content. B2B brands have struggled so far, earning only 1% of traffic,
but the desktop rollout could help.

 EVENT AMBUSHING: HOW SMART BRANDS WIN BIG WITHOUT SPONSORSHIPS (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Event ambushing allows brands to insert themselves into major
cultural moments without paying for official sponsorship. Puma paid
Pele $120K to tie his shoes on camera at the 1970 World Cup, Nike
outfitted 400 athletes and launched a parallel campaign during the
2012 Olympics, and Rihanna promoted Fenty Beauty during her 2023 Super
Bowl performance. These moments worked because they felt natural,
aligned with the brand, and captured massive attention. While not for
every brand, it's a bold way to gain visibility without the
sponsorship price tag. 

 SEO LEADERS ARE PRODUCT MANAGERS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SEO performance is often restricted by organizational structure,
especially when it reports through traditional marketing channels with
no direct access to technical resources. Treating SEO as a product
function gives it ownership over planning, engineering alignment, and
long-term investment. By shifting the SEO manager role into product
management, companies can integrate SEO into the core of the digital
strategy roadmap.
