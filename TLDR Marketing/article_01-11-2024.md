NEWS & TRENDS

 THE AWARENESS ADVANTAGE: WHY BRAND BUILDING AND PERFORMANCE MARKETING
ARE BFF GOALS ON TIKTOK (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Research shows that strong brand awareness correlates with improved
performance marketing outcomes. For example, brands recognized by 40%
of consumers achieve 43% greater efficiency in performance marketing
than those known by only 30%. While CTRs don't correlate with brand
awareness, conversion rates — critical for performance marketing —
do, showing the need for marketers to evaluate their efforts
holistically. Stronger brand awareness lays the foundation for more
effective performance marketing, showing that these strategies work
best together rather than in competition. 

 TRAVEL TUESDAY IS REAL — AND GROWING (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 U.S. search interest for "Travel Tuesday" increased by over fivefold
in two years. There was a booking surge in 2023 that focused on resort
destinations. This trend, though currently more concentrated in North
America, shows consumer interest in deals that drive bookings during a
traditionally slow period. Travel brands can view Travel Tuesday as an
emerging opportunity for promoting package deals and capturing
end-of-year demand.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO TURBOCHARGE YOUR GOLF GAME (AND YOUR COPYWRITING) (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Effective ad copy leverages key persuasion techniques. Grab attention
with a direct, benefit-oriented headline and build trust through
abundant, strategically placed testimonials. Engage the audience by
naming unique processes, using insider language, and prompting readers
to envision a desirable outcome. A soft upsell invites curiosity
rather than pressuring for a sale. Ads can be improved through testing
simple changes, like enhancing guarantees or framing the price as an
investment. 

 FIND YOUR CUSTOMERS' PAINS AND DESIRES (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 To uncover your customers' core pains, step into their shoes and
visualize their daily challenges, frustrations, and ambitions.
Consider the everyday issues that disrupt their workflows, the
bigger-picture problems that may cause anxiety or sleepless nights,
and the goals they aspire to reach in the future. Look at both
professional and personal impacts, as workplace challenges often
affect life beyond the office. If more clarity is needed, conduct
customer interviews, sales conversations, and reviews to gather
insights that connect with their deeper motivations and needs. 

 HOW TO CLOSE THE “TRANSLATION” GAP BETWEEN MARKETERS AND
DESIGNERS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Transforming marketing ideas into ad creatives can be challenging.
Start by providing clear briefs that outline objectives, tone, design
direction, and key elements, ideally with a simple sketch. Share a
swipe file with examples to inspire and train designers on effective
ad styles. Offer balanced feedback, noting strengths and areas for
improvement, and encourage teamwork through collaborative workshops to
ensure alignment. This reduces miscommunication, shortens feedback
loops, and improves creative results.

 YOUTUBE HOLDS TOP SPOT FOR CREATOR CONTENT AND PRODUCT RESEARCH FOR
SECOND CONSECUTIVE YEAR (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Traacker's 2025 Influencer Marketing Impact Report identifies
YouTube, used weekly by 86% of U.S. Millennial and Gen Z consumers, as
the top platform for creator content and product reviews. 34% of them
rank it as their preferred source for product information. Short
videos under five minutes are the most engaging, with nearly half of
consumers preferring them. However, Gen Z and male-identifying viewers
often favor longer videos. 64% of consumers say they trust creators
who demonstrate product expertise and 75% want clear disclosure when
AI is used to generate content.

 BUSTING THE MYTHS ABOUT BUILDING YOUR BRAND (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Brand building is the secret tool for keeping your brand memorable at
every twist and turn. It's accessible to all businesses, not just
those with big budgets. It also plays a key role in performance
campaigns, enhancing recall and customer loyalty, which directly
supports conversions. Branding is as important in B2B as in B2C. 

 HOW TO EVOLVE A LEGACY BRAND'S SOCIAL STRATEGY (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A tone shift and strategic content redesign helped The Booker Prizes'
posts achieve notable reach, with non-follower engagement climbing to
31% on key posts. The content approach included adding humor and
storytelling elements tailored to Instagram and creating engaging,
video-based content that resonates with a broader audience. This
strategic move is slowly evolving perceptions of the Booker Prize from
highbrow to approachable and reaching audiences well beyond the
company's core followers. 

 HOW TO BUILD A BILLION-DOLLAR MARKETPLACE — DO'S AND DON'TS FROM
THE GROWTH EXPERT BEHIND GRUBHUB, PINTEREST, AND MORE (17 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Casey Winters built Grubhub's growth strategy from scratch, expanding
the company from 40,000 users to over a million users across 1,000
cities. Successful marketplaces focus on scalable acquisition loops
and unique data advantages to attract both supply and demand. In the
early stages, marketplace founders should start with non-scalable work
and prioritize customer retention through repeated “aha” moments.
Avoid excessive reliance on supply-driven demand and overusing
discounts to drive growth. It is important to master one market before
expansion and continually raise supplier standards to maintain
quality.
