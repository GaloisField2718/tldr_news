NEWS & TRENDS

 US ADVERTISING SPILL CAN MAKE A MESS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 US advertising spill now risks damaging Canadian brands rather than
helping them. Decades ago, American ads that reached Canadian
audiences offered free exposure and often aligned closely enough with
local positioning to be beneficial. Today, US brands promoting
“America First” messaging create tension when those same brands
present themselves as “Proudly Canadian” north of the border. When
corporate campaigns in the US focus on nationalism, the spillover can
undermine local credibility and make Canadian consumers feel excluded.


 YOUTUBE SHORTS NOW GENERATES MORE REVENUE PER WATCH HOUR THAN
TRADITIONAL VIDEOS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 YouTube Shorts now earns more revenue per watch hour than traditional
videos. Strong ad performance, teen engagement, and higher conversion
rates than TikTok have made Shorts a key growth driver alongside live
sports and subscriptions. AI tools are improving content creation and
shoppable video features, while direct response and retail ads led to
a 15% rise in ad revenue.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AGENTIC MARKETING: INBOUND IS JUST THE BEGINNING (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Agentic Marketing redefines the funnel as a connected system where
marketing stays involved across the buyer journey. AI agents qualify
and route leads across inbound and outbound channels based on behavior
and context, from form fills and email clicks to webinar activity and
dormant CRM records. The divide between marketing, SDRs, and sales
fades as agents manage real-time interactions and optimize follow-ups.
Adoption often starts with one touchpoint, like live chat or
post-event follow-up, before scaling to full-funnel orchestration. 

 A CASE STUDY IN REDESIGNING NAVIGATION (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The redesigned navigation for SFG20 increased SaaS demo requests by
38%. Simplifying the menu from 12 to 8 items improved usability and
readability. The new design also led to a 35% increase in menu link
clicks and a 12% rise in visits to key pages, including an 18%
increase to “What is SFG20” and 52% to “Facilities-iQ.” The
update reduced bounce rates and helped users better understand SFG20's
offerings through clearer organization and storytelling.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 REGEX IN GSC REVEALS CHATGPT SEARCHES (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ChatGPT and its browser Atlas rely on Google searches to answer
prompts, producing longer, more detailed queries that often focus on
pricing, reviews, and product comparisons. These queries can be
detected in GSC using regular expressions to filter by length,
transactional or brand terms, informational prompts, or listicle
mentions. GA4 can identify pages driving the most ChatGPT traffic,
which can then be linked to long-tail queries. Extensions like GSC
Helper and Better Regex simplify saving, filtering, and exporting
regex patterns to analyze AI-driven search activity. 

 GOOGLE LOCAL SERVICES ADS VS. SEARCH ADS: WHICH DRIVES BETTER LOCAL
LEADS? (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Local businesses can generate leads through Google Ads using LSAs or
traditional Search campaigns. LSAs offer quick setup with minimal
management, relying on verification, accurate listings, and strong
reviews. Google handles keyword matching, so tracking is key to gauge
lead quality. Search campaigns provide greater control through custom
copy, manual keywords, negatives, and bid strategies. They enable
testing and segmentation but require more time and expertise.

 DIARY OF A BRAND: MONCLER (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Moncler evolved from a technical outerwear maker to a luxury brand by
tying function to aspiration. CEO Remo Ruffini drove this through
selective distribution and high-impact fashion events that placed
Moncler among top houses. Its signature puffed design and the Genius
platform, now a cross-industry creative hub, deepened cultural
relevance. Moncler expanded categories and achieved top-tier margins
by prioritizing brand perception over short-term gains. 

 HOW LOOM GREW TO 25M USERS WITHOUT TRADITIONAL MARKETING: PRODUCT-LED
GROWTH MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Loom grew to 25M users without traditional marketing by making its
product inherently shareable and easy to use. Its freemium model,
Chrome extension, and built-in branding turned every shared video into
a growth loop that brought in new users organically. The company's
success came from smart positioning as a tool that enhances existing
workflows rather than replaces them, appealing to knowledge workers in
remote and hybrid setups. Its timing before the remote work boom and
focus on friendly, simple design helped it become a $975M acquisition
by Atlassian in 2023.
