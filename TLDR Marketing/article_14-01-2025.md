NEWS & TRENDS

 NEWS ORGANIZATIONS FEAR A DROP IN REFERRALS, THREATENING A KEY SOURCE
OF TRUST FOR BRANDS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 News organizations anticipate a decline in search referrals as social
platforms deprioritize news and AI-generated summaries become standard
in search. News has long been a trusted space for advertising, dating
back to the rise of newspapers and TV. Despite concerns about traffic,
publishers are investing in AI and focusing on social video platforms
like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram to adapt. 

 CES WAS A GIANT EXERCISE IN AI GASLIGHTING (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI branding dominated this year's CES, often masking a lack of
meaningful innovation. Many products repackaged existing features as
AI, from ‚Äúsmart‚Äù remotes to laptops with basic chat-based
settings. Smart glasses and AI PCs promised more but delivered limited
practical applications. Amid the AI hype, genuine hardware
advancements stood out, including Samsung's cutting-edge display
technology and improved laptops with better battery life.

 NARROW POSITIONING: HOW SAYING NO TO SOME CUSTOMERS INCREASES YOUR
CHANCES OF WINNING BIG (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Autodesk's success began with AutoCAD, a cost-effective CAD program
for engineers and architects that was priced at a fraction of its
competitors. By addressing a specific audience's needs, Autodesk grew
into a $5B revenue company with a $60B market cap. Narrowing focus
enhances expertise, uncovers opportunities, and strengthens messaging.
In contrast, companies that try to serve everyone often fail to stand
out and grow. 

 THE ‚ÄòVALUE NOW' CONSUMER: MAKING SENSE OF US CONSUMER SENTIMENT AND
SPENDING (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 US consumer sentiment remains low despite economic strength. Spending
exceeds pre-pandemic levels, driven by a "value now" mindset, where
consumers focus on immediate value. They're splurging on experiences
like dining while cutting back on low-value items like cars. Middle
and low-income groups are under financial pressure, but their spending
increases as they select purchases that offer both good value and
quality within their budgets.

offer granular insights across campaigns and geographies and adapt to
changing business contexts with time-varying models. Designed for
