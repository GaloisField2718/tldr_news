NEWS & TRENDS

 FROM PREMIUMIZATION TO PRECARITY: NEW SIGNALS FROM THE CONSUMER
ECONOMY (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Rising defaults in the US subprime auto loan sector are signaling
deeper financial strain among consumers and raising concerns about the
stability of private credit markets. Auto loan delinquencies over 60
days have climbed to around 5% since early 2022, and auto loan debt
has increased by nearly $1tn over the past decade. The private credit
sector, now worth trillions, has created systemic risks due to its
lack of transparency and $4.5 trillion in exposure across US and EU
banks. For marketers, the shrinking middle class and growing financial
precarity mean a need to shift focus from income-based targeting
toward lifestyle and attitude segmentation, while emphasizing
stability and trust. 

 THE EVOLVING WORLD OF SHOPPING ON YOUTUBE (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Shopping on YouTube is now a connected system of creators,
communities, and content that drives what people buy. Creators use
expertise and passion to guide purchases, and 43% of Gen Z feel more
loyal to brands they recommend. Communities built around shared
interests, like fragrance or home improvement, turn enthusiasm into
sales. Hauls, reviews, and gift guides remain top formats, viewed over
a billion times in 2025. With 61% of Gen Z discovering new brands
through YouTube, the platform has become a cultural hub for shopping.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUTUBE SEO TIP FOR B2B BRANDS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 B2B brands can create YouTube SEO videos by starting with blog posts
ranking 3-10 for target keywords. If a post is gaining traction and
videos appear in the SERP or AI Overview, it signals a strong
opportunity. Using the blog as an outline makes video creation easier
and lets both formats support each other in search rankings. To
maximize impact, include key takeaways in the intro and use
eye-catching thumbnails. Add chapters with transition slides and
timestamps, include keywords in titles, descriptions, and tags, and
link back to the blog whenever relevant. 

 HOW TO BUILD YOUR ICP THE RIGHT WAY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A company that matches firmographic criteria may not actually need
the product. A stronger ICP starts with use cases or categories. Use
case-based markets focus on specific workflows teams must perform to
benefit from the product, while category-based markets focus on what
companies already buy or plan to replace. Both have built-in demand
and can later be refined with firmographic data. Instead of starting
with broad lists of firmographics, start with known workflows or
categories, then layer in firmographic details. 

 5 BARRIERS TO GREAT CART CONVERSION RATES AND HOW TO FIX THEM (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cart conversion rates often suffer due to checkout experiences that
introduce unnecessary friction or delay. Common issues include broken
autofill, excessive steps, and unclear delivery estimates, which can
lead to user frustration and abandonment. Mobile check-out, now the
dominant channel for many verticals, tends to compound these issues
when not properly optimized. Payment preferences also vary, with 1 in
10 shoppers abandoning carts if their preferred method is unavailable.
Lifecycle segmentation offers additional leverage by aligning offers
and communication with behavioral intent. For example, brands that use
product-specific reviews in abandoned cart reminders see improved
engagement.

 BURSTING THE MARKETER-THINK BUBBLE: YOUR AUDIENCE ISN'T YOU (9 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Kantar's 2025 Media Reactions data highlights major gaps between
marketer assumptions and consumer realities. While consumers prefer
platforms like Amazon, TikTok, and Snapchat for ad relevance and
experience, marketers continue prioritizing Google and YouTube.
Offline touchpoints such as point of sale and events still play a key
role in decision-making, yet investment skews heavily towards digital
ads. AI adoption reveals further disconnects, with marketers
expressing confidence while consumers express concern about trust. 

 “WOMAN-OWNED” BUSINESSES SEEM MORE COMPETENT (3 MINUTE READ) [14]


 Businesses that use a “woman-owned” label are seen as more
competent and higher quality, increasing purchase interest by up to
27%. In experiments with 2,585 people, a finance business labeled
“woman-owned” was rated 8.6% more competent and 10.9% higher in
service quality than the same business without the label. The effect
was strongest, at 26.8% higher perceived quality, when the owner's
experience level was unknown and in competitive or male-dominated
industries. The label works because it signals confidence, challenging
the stereotype that women are less competent in business.
