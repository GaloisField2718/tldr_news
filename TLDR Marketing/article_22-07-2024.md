STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BEST TIPS FOR ABANDONED CART RECOVERY (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 88% of carts are abandoned before purchase. To address this, offer
limited-time discounts and send triggered text messages to remind
customers of their incomplete purchases. Use progress bars on checkout
pages to guide users and reduce drop-offs. Automated email reminders
and transparent cost disclosures help recover lost sales. Building
trust through social proof and offering a money-back guarantee also
encourage purchase completion.

 4 WAYS PPC AND SEO CAN WORK TOGETHER (AND WHEN THEY CAN'T) (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Promote SEO content through ads to maximize value. Use PPC to build
links to important SEO content or retarget users to advance them in
the buyer's journey. Dominate critical keywords by ranking for them in
search while running ads simultaneously. Use PPC for quick results,
and use SEO when paid keywords are too expensive.

 THE SECRET BEHIND STELLAR NORTH STAR METRICS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A North Star Metric (NSM) is a metric companies use as a focus for
their growth. For example, Spotify identified "time spent listening"
as its NSM, instead of common metrics like subscriber count or revenue
per user. A good NSM measures customer value, encourages engagement,
and predicts retention and growth. NSMs should be based on fundamental
aspects of the business that are unlikely to change soon. 

 NETFLIX'S AD TECH FOCUS (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Netflix's growth model is evolving with the rise of ad-supported
memberships, which grew 34% quarter-over-quarter and now account for
45% of sign-ups in available markets. Despite this rapid growth,
Netflix's current ad inventory can't keep pace, so significant ad
revenue isn't expected until after 2025. To address this, Netflix is
developing an in-house ad tech platform set to launch globally in
2025.
