 ADOBE'S CONTROVERSIAL MARKETING IS FUELING A WAR WITH CREATIVES OVER
AI (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Adobe's recent marketing for Photoshop's AI features, such as
‚Äúgenerate background‚Äù, has sparked backlash from photographers.
The controversy began when Adobe's website suggested users could
‚Äúskip the photoshoot‚Äù by using AI to add or replace backgrounds,
which many photographers saw as undermining their profession. Adobe
has since removed the contentious language and emphasized that its AI
tools are meant to enhance, not replace human creativity. This issue
reflects broader tensions between creatives and tech companies over
the impact of AI on creative jobs. 

 WHAT THE TECH IS DOMAIN SPOOFING? (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Domain spoofing in digital advertising is a fraudulent scheme where
scammers create websites that mimic legitimate publishers to sell fake
ad inventory. The spoofed sites can distribute malware, sell
illegitimate products, and are often overloaded with ads. To combat
domain spoofing, advertisers use supply-path optimization. This brings
buyers and sellers closer together, providing marketers with a clearer
idea of where their ads end up.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW MANY KEYWORDS PER AD GROUP IN GOOGLE ADS? (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Choosing the right mix of keywords can increase your reach while also
reducing unnecessary ad spend. Google lets you set up to 20,000 target
items (such as keywords or customer groups) per ad group, but you
should be using less than 2,000 per ad group. The exact number to use
depends on your business size, campaign goals, competition, budget,
and keyword match types. Over your campaign's lifespan, you should
remove keywords that fail to deliver results, test new ones, and
continue to track keyword performance. 

 HOW TO DO AN IN-DEPTH CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AUDIT (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A CX audit involves analyzing every touchpoint from initial contact
to post-purchase and identifying areas for improvement to enhance
satisfaction and loyalty. It also helps prevent customer losses, as
even a single negative experience can deter 45% of customers from
making a purchase. An effective audit requires a skilled,
cross-functional team, clear objectives, appropriate tools, and a
detailed analysis of all customer interactions. The insights gained
should then be linked to business metrics.
