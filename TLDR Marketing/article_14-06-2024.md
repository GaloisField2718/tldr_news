‚ÄòROLLBACKS' (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TV networks are struggling in the current upfront market as
advertisers reduce their spending and demand significant rate
rollbacks. With an oversupply of streaming ad inventory and reduced
demand, networks like Disney, NBCUniversal, and Fox are aggressively

last year's Hollywood labor strike and cautious advertisers, further
complicating the market.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

creating engaging content through the ‚ÄúHOP‚Äù method ‚Äî Humble

 HOOK YOUR AUDIENCE WITH SERIALIZED STORIES (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 People love serialized content ‚Äî from TV shows like Friends to
podcasts like Dirty John ‚Äî and B2B companies can tap into this
obsession with a serialized podcast. The podcast should provide
insights or entertainment that establish your brand as an industry
authority and should be offered in both audio and video formats.
Late-night talk show entertainment concepts can make the content feel
more approachable and real. Use social media to share teaser clips,
behind-the-scenes content, and episode announcements. Use podcast
analytics tools to track episode performance and seek out audience
feedback to improve future episodes.

 ADVERTISERS: PLAN FOR LIFE AFTER THE IP ADDRESS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 IP addresses may be nearing obsolescence due to enhanced privacy
measures. Despite delays in phasing out cookies, IP addresses have
become a crucial alternative. However, companies like Google, Amazon,
and Apple are limiting access to these signals. Advertisers need to
take note and accept the ongoing loss of various tracking signals
driven by regulatory changes. 

 3 STAGES OF BOARD DECK PREPARATION FOR MARKETERS (5 MINUTE READ) [13]


 A board meeting is meant to be a review of the company's strategy,
how it's performing, and the planned changes to get better performance
in the future. For a marketer preparing slides, the first step is to
clarify the strategy, report on the results, analyze trends, and
evolve the strategy and plans ‚Äì which ends up producing many slides.
The C-suite review of the deck may result in additional analysis and
slides, but in the end, the marketing section might be cut down to
just 1-2 slides. While this process can be frustrating, each step is
important as a forcing function for strategic thinking, performance
management, and having deep conversations on what really matters.
