NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES KEEP COPYING EACH OTHER (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Social media companies frequently mimic each other's successful
features to stay competitive. Platforms are often trend-driven,
adopting popular formats to avoid losing relevance. Snapchat has
introduced a new vertical video feed that combines its Stories and
Spotlight, resembling TikTok's format. This follows Snapchat's past
struggle when Instagram copied its Stories feature, leading to a
significant growth decline for Snapchat. 

 HOW BREAKING UP GOOGLE COULD LOWER YOUR ONLINE SHOPPING BILL (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Experts claim Google's monopolistic practices inflate advertising
fees, which are passed on to consumers, raising prices for everyday
goods. The antitrust trial illustrates how Google's dominance stifles
competition, reduces innovation, and results in lower-quality ads
targeting consumers with irrelevant products. A breakup could promote
alternative ad models that enhance privacy and improve ad quality,
benefiting both consumers and publishers.
