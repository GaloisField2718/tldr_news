NEWS & TRENDS

 INFLUENCER MARKETING'S IMPACT CONTINUES TO BE LARGELY UNPROVEN (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Brands are investing more in influencer strategies without fully
measuring the long-term impact. Half of marketers say they cannot
prove ROI from influencer campaigns, and 44% admit to running
campaigns without KPIs. About 48% say they do not know how to drive
sales through influencer content, while 60% struggle to identify
influencers that fit their brand. Although 54% of marketers plan to
increase influencer budgets and 60% believe it will grow in
importance, 80% of global brands do not factor influencer marketing
into their marketing mix modeling. 

 META IS STRUGGLING TO REIN IN ITS AI CHATBOTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta is revising its chatbot rules after a Reuters investigation
showed the AI could engage minors in harmful conversations and
inappropriate romantic exchanges. It has begun training chatbots to
avoid discussions about self-harm, suicide, and eating disorders, and
to redirect minors to expert resources. Reuters found that the
platform hosted bots impersonating celebrities like Taylor Swift and
Scarlett Johansson, some of which generated explicit content, and one
of these bots was even created by a Meta employee.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW SMALL BUSINESSES CAN USE LINK BUILDING TO BOOST VISIBILITY (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Start with a compliance audit to fix risks, then lock in easy wins
like local citations, reclaiming unlinked mentions, and responding to
journalist requests. Use competitor gap analysis, content refreshes,
and internal linking to maximize existing assets, and small-scale
digital PR campaigns and guest posts to add fresh, high-quality links.
Structure content for answer-engine visibility with clear data and
markup. 

 HOW TO PREVENT PPC ALGORITHMS FROM BURNING YOUR BUDGET (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 PPC automation can scale campaigns quickly, but can also drain
budgets at record speed. Key tactics include setting guardrails with
negative keywords, placement exclusions, and CRM-qualified conversion
imports. Algorithms should be fed clean data through tagged high-value
events, first-party audiences, and varied creative assets. It is
important to monitor early wins, which often fade after initial
remarketing.

 SEO REMINDER: YOUR LOG FILES CAN TELL YOU HOW CHATGPT AND CLAUDE ARE
ENGAGING WITH YOUR SITE (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 You can see how often and where LLM chatbots are engaging with your
content in your website's log files. These aren't traditional search
clicks that show up in Google Analytics, but rather are AI agents
actively retrieving your content to answer someone's question inside
an LLM conversation. Digging into your log files gives you visibility
into which pages the bot is pulling into conversations, whether it's
pulling from top-of-funnel content or mid-to-bottom funnel pages that
actually convert, and how your buyer's journey looks through the lens
of AI retrieval.

 PUBLICATIONS AIMED AT LGBTQ+ AUDIENCES FACE DISCRIMINATION FROM
ADVERTISERS, EDITORS WARN (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Publications aimed at LGBTQ+ and minority audiences are losing
advertiser support after political backlash against diversity and
inclusion campaigns. Gay Times reported losing 80% of its advertisers
in the past year. Many outlets note that brands once eager to align
with diverse communities are now hesitant, citing “brand safety”
concerns and shifting PR value. Some publishers with stronger
advertiser relationships have been less affected, but overall
political pressures have made brands more cautious about supporting
minority-focused media. 

 OUR OBSESSION WITH EFFICIENCY IS COSTING US OUR HUMANITY (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Society's obsession with efficiency, driven by technology and AI, is
erasing the small frictions that make life meaningful. Instant
purchases, automated tools, and frictionless services speed everything
up but strip away slow, ordinary moments like cooking, daydreaming on
a commute, or taking the long route home that give life texture and
joy. Embrace inefficiency and savor the scenic route instead of a
frictionless, soulless existence.
