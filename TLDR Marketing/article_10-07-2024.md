STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO CREATE EVERGREEN CONTENT TO WARM UP CUSTOMERS (8 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Evergreen content includes how-to guides, FAQs, listicles, and
thought-leadership interviews. This type of content, which can be
repurposed across various channels, improves a brand's sending
reputation and ensures emails are more likely to reach their
audience's inboxes. Focus on timeless topics, optimize for SEO,
conduct thorough keyword research, and ensure the content is relevant
to your audience's needs. Implementing evergreen content into email
campaigns also saves time and resources, reducing the need for
constant updates.

purchasing behavior). Lastly, determine their scrolling approach
(hourly and daily patterns). Use these insights to guide what and when
your brand shares content.
