 BRILLIANT CAMPAIGNS AREN'T BORN IN 15-PERSON MEETINGS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Creative-by-committee is a recipe for blandness - and who's got time
to create anything when your calendar is back-to-back, anyway?

Meet less, do more, and keep everyone on the same page with Loom [4].

Record your screen and voice to walk through campaign briefs, present
creative concepts, or gather asset feedback - all async. No more
waiting for calendars to align.

Feedback comes in as timestamped comments directly on your videos.
Reviews keep moving even when teams are distributed or in different
timezones. Loom AI [4] automatically generates titles, summaries, and
chapters for your videos, plus removes filler words and silence to
keep everything tight.

Fewer bottlenecks. Faster launches. Start Looming [4]

NEWS & TRENDS

 GLOBAL GROWTH REMAINS SLUGGISH AS TARIFF THREATS LOOM (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Global economic growth is expected to slow as trade tensions and
protectionist policies weigh on output. The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) projects global growth will fall to 3.2% in 2025 and 3.1%
in 2026, down from 3.3% last year. The US is forecast to slow to 2%
growth this year from 2.8% in 2024, while China's growth is expected
to drop to 4.8% and continue falling to 4.2% in 2026. The IMF warned
that rising tariffs could fuel inflation in the US as higher import
costs begin to reach consumers. 

 RAGEBAIT IS EVERYWHERE. SHOULD MARKETERS LEAN IN? (5 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Brands and creators are using anger to drive engagement, sometimes on
purpose, often by accident. Campaigns like Doritos joking about chip
shapes spark playful conversation, while American Eagle's Sydney
Sweeney launch or e.l.f.'s Matt Rife partnership drew backlash for
touching sensitive topics. Reactions can come from personalities,
networks, or unexpected forces. Success comes from cultural awareness,
vetting who's involved, watching responses in real time, and being
clear about values so audiences know where the brand stands.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE OPTIMAL EMAIL MARKETING FREQUENCY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sending 7 emails monthly is the optimal frequency for maximizing
customer lifetime value. Reducing this to 4 emails cut lifetime profit
by 32%, while increasing it to 10 emails reduced profit by 16%. The
best results come from tailoring email frequency by purchase behavior,
sending 5-7 emails to frequent buyers, 6-10 to medium buyers, and
12-14 to infrequent buyers. Frequent buyers tend to ignore more
emails, while occasional buyers engage more when they receive
additional messages. 

 AI IS NOW LOOKING FOR THIS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI citations are now on average 393 days newer than Google search
results. Content with a recent date in the title or offer name is 50%
more likely to appear in AI results. Update your reports, webinars,
podcasts, guides, and blog titles. Instead of “The State of HR
Laws”, use “The State of HR Laws – Q4 2025”. Add timestamps in
your copy and refresh old content with current context. 

 DOES TRENDJACKING WORK? (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Trendjacking can deliver short-term brand relevance when it reflects
the values and behaviors of your audience. Before joining a trend, ask
whether it fits your brand's industry and whether your audience will
care. Arby's capitalized on the viral sea shanty moment on TikTok to
promote its fish sandwich, combining cultural relevance with humor.
Strategic use of trend hashtags helped extend its reach.

 HOW ATLASSIAN USED LOOM TO REDUCE A CAMPAIGN LAUNCH FROM 90 TO 39
DAYS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 When Loom's marketing team needed to launch a brand campaign fast,
they ate their own dog food. Learn how they used Loom [10] for async
video briefs, stakeholder reviews, and feedback loops instead of
waiting for calendars to sync - and what normally took a full quarter
got done in 39 days. Read how they did it [10] 

 WALMART IS INCORPORATING CHATGPT INTO ONLINE SHOPPING. HERE'S HOW. (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Walmart is partnering with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its
online shopping platform, allowing customers to search for products,
receive recommendations, and complete purchases through AI-powered
chat. The collaboration will also use OpenAI's Instant Checkout to let
shoppers buy items directly within the chatbot. Walmart said the
system will become more proactive as it learns customer preferences,
aiming to make shopping faster and more personalized. A Coresight
Research survey found 64% of consumers already use, plan to use, or
want to use generative AI for shopping, and 29% are more likely to
shop on sites with an AI chatbot. 

 2025 INSTAGRAM CONTENT PLAYBOOK (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 An analysis of 700M IG posts from January to June 2025 showed that
posting frequency is the strongest predictor of account growth across
all follower tiers. Reels drive reach for smaller accounts under 50K
followers, while carousels outperform Reels in engagement for larger
accounts, with the gap widening for accounts over 500K followers.
Optimal posting is 8 PM on Wednesday and Friday. Trial Reels allow
safe testing, scheduling maintains consistency, and influencer
collaborations generate three times more engagement than brand posts. 

 HOW TO KNOW IF YOUR GEO IS WORKING (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Generative Engine Optimization rewards brands that are easy for AI
tools to recommend in commercial moments. Track four specific outcomes
to understand if your GEO strategy is working: share of search
reflects how well your brand stands out, buyer-intent traffic shows
whether that visibility leads to action, prompt visibility across AI
tools signals credibility and brand strength, and conversational
queries measure how effectively content drives qualified traffic.

 CORPORATE PRESSURE KILLED LULULEMON'S CREATIVE SOUL (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Lululemon's founder, Chip Wilson, used a full-page Wall Street
Journal ad to call out the company's current marketing strategy. In
his critique, Wilson blamed the board for dismantling the company's
creative DNA and diluting what made the brand distinctive. He cited a
loss of product focus, brand differentiation, entrepreneurial drive,
and creative leadership. When growth outpaces brand identity,
companies lose pricing power and relevance. Wilson's call to reverse
what he calls “GAP-ivization” is a reminder to protect what made a
brand valuable in the first place. 

 INSIDE ADVERTISING'S MOST GRUELING NEW GENRE: ‘YOU HAVE TO HAVE
ZERO SOCIAL ANXIETY' (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 203 Media is building a profitable marketing niche with unscripted
street interview ads, offering brands a human antidote to AI-generated
content. Founder Josh Suggs leads a team that captures raw reactions
to consumer products in public spaces, then packages them into
native-style ad creatives for platforms like TikTok and Instagram. The
model works best for challenger brands looking to build trust fast.
The format is high-effort but high-impact, requiring skilled
interviewers with relentless hustle and zero social anxiety.
