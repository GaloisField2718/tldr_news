 AI CAN TRANSFORM MARKETING - BUT WILL CUSTOMER TRUST SURVIVE?
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Without trust, transparency, and strong privacy practices, innovation
can backfire. As third-party cookies disappear and privacy regulations
expand, marketers looking to build on the latest AI technologies must
invest in first-party data.

This guide by OneTrust [4] covers:

 	* WHY FIRST-PARTY DATA IS THE FOUNDATION OF AI SUCCESS [4] in a
post-cookie, privacy-first world.
 	* HOW TO ADOPT A CONSENT-FIRST STRATEGY that drives engagement
instead of creating friction.
 	* BEST PRACTICES FOR COMMUNICATING AI DATA USAGE clearly,
increasing transparency, and building long-term loyalty.
 	* THE ROLE OF UNIFIED CONSENT AND PREFERENCE MANAGEMENT in AI-ready
marketing frameworks.

NEWS & TRENDS

 OK BOOMER, WHAT'S NEXT? RETHINKING GENERATIONAL MARKETING MYTHS (9
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Generational marketing based on birth-year labels is oversimplified.
Instead, focus on factors like life stage, identity, fandoms,
microcultures, and behavioral mindsets to understand real consumer
motivations. Segmentation works best when it blends cultural nuance,
data, and psychographics rather than relying on clichés. Generational
cohorts can provide context, but shouldn't be the main lens. Marketing
today requires interest-driven and culturally attuned approaches to
reflect how people actually live. 

 WHAT AI MARKETING JOBS LOOK LIKE TODAY (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI has become a central part of marketing jobs, with many listings
now requiring AI skills or experience. About 75% of workers report
using AI because it is officially or unofficially expected, yet 95% of
genAI programs at work are failing. New roles such as AI marketing
program managers at large companies like Stripe pay up to $210,000,
while startups like Firecrawl are experimenting with fully AI-driven
agent roles offering $5,000 monthly retainers. The future of marketing
jobs is splitting into three paths: fully AI-focused roles,
traditional roles adapted with AI expectations, and fully AI agents
replacing human work, leaving nearly 60% of marketers worried about
job replacement.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WIN REPORT: REMEMBER ME? HOW SAVED SESSIONS BOOSTED CONVERSIONS BY
16% (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A travel booking platform tested a “welcome back” prompt that
reminded users of the last experience they viewed. The prompt helped
visitors continue their browsing without restarting, which addressed a
major friction point in vacation planning. The test showed a 16%
increase in conversions among returning visitors. The results
highlight the importance of continuity in multi-session
decision-making. 

 FROM QUERY TO CITATION: HOW SNIPPET SIGNALS INFLUENCE AI SEARCH (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI search engines reward content that aligns with user intent and
search language. Informational queries need precision, with 70% of
cited pages matching at least 60% of query terms and over 60% using
phrases like “how to” or “what is.” Commercial queries favor
breadth, with 25% of titles using synonyms and 90% having under 30%
word overlap. To improve visibility, match titles and slugs to user
intent, keep phrasing clear for informational searches, and use
synonyms and related terms for commercial ones.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO RUN GMAIL ADS IN 2025 (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google has reintroduced Gmail Ads through Demand Gen campaigns,
allowing advertisers to run campaigns exclusively in Gmail. Gmail Ads
can appear as single image, carousel, video, or product feed ads, and
they show in the Promotions or Social tabs with a teaser ad that
expands into a full ad when clicked. Targeting options include
demographics, in-market segments, custom segments, lookalikes, and
retargeting, though content targeting is not available. Success is
measured through engagement rate, click-through rate, and conversion
rate, with strategies varying depending on whether the audience is
warm or cold. 

 CUSTOM GPT TIP (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Use “input flows” when building custom GPTs to improve output
quality. Instead of giving one big prompt, break the task into a
series of structured questions, each with predefined answer options.
For example, when creating a content marketing GPT, ask about audience
familiarity, topic, primary audience, and key messages step by step.
This approach mimics a human interviewer, ensuring the GPT receives a
clear, detailed brief so it can deliver better results. 

 LISTEN LATER (TOOL) [11] 

 Listen Later converts written content, such as articles, blog posts,
PDFs, newsletters, and email text, into audio podcast episodes. The
service cleans up the content, removes ads, converts it to audio, and
delivers it to a private podcast feed that works in any standard
podcast app for listening on the go.

 HUBSPOT UNVEILS LOOP MARKETING STRATEGY TO ADDRESS AI DISRUPTION (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 60% of searches now end on platforms like Google or ChatGPT. HubSpot
launched “the Loop” to address shrinking website traffic and
evolving customer journeys. The framework consists of four stages
(Express, Tailor, Amplify, and Evolve) that accelerate campaign
launches, improve personalization, and boost performance through
AI-assisted iteration. 

 WILL GOOGLE'S ANTITRUST SEARCH RULING IMPACT MARKETING SEO
STRATEGIES? (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google will be required to share parts of its search index and
user-interaction data with qualified competitors, including AI
platforms such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, marking a major regulatory
milestone in the search market. While immediate effects on rankings
may be limited because core algorithms and advertising data remain
under Google's control, the decision signals a longer-term shift
toward a more fragmented search ecosystem as Google's market share
drops below 90% and AI-driven assistants gain momentum. For marketers,
this creates a future where visibility will depend on building
authority, securing placement across multiple discovery platforms, and
optimizing for both search engines and AI assistants.
