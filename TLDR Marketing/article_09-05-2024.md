stakeholders faster so they can make informed decisions quicker. Build
an accessible insights repository that's tagged with research and
business questions. Invest in quick-turnaround self-serve research

 HOW TO PERFECT YOUR SHARABLE CONTENT GAME (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The typical scroller reshares content when it connects with an
interest, a feeling, or a belief. Once a week, pick a piece of content
that's going to get you the most new eyeballs by being super sharable.
First, pick the connection point that's going to convince your
audience to share. Then pick a format to deliver the content through.
This could be a statement, quote, meme, or trending topic. Lastly,
post, test, track, and repeat. Memes may work well on Threads, but not
on LinkedIn. Case study posts may get several story reshares, but
nothing as an X thread. The only way to know is to test.

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE NOSTALGIA EFFECT (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Nostalgia Effect explains why people spend more when they
remember their past. Researchers found that nostalgia fills people
with a sense of connection and belonging, and those feelings fulfill
basic human needs. Consequently, in those moments people tend to view
money as less important and desirable. Marketers can use nostalgia by
modernizing icons or imagery from the past, using storytelling to
evoke desired emotions, or by tapping into throwbacks that Millennials
or Gen Z would love. 

 COKE VS. PEPSI: AN ALL-TIME MARKETING BLUNDER (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Despite overwhelmingly positive feedback from focus groups and taste
tests by nearly 200,000 people, the launch of the New Coke formula was
an undeniable failure. Coke had been seeking a way to gain market
share from its rival, Pepsi, but it ended up generating overwhelming
customer backlash. Customers hated the New Coke simply because of what
the original Coke meant to them, not because of the new drink's taste.
Pepsi capitalized on Coke's failure by giving its employees the day
off and declaring victory in full-page newspaper ads. This marketing
blunder illustrates why brands should watch what their customers do
‚Äì not what they say. Moreover, a passionate audience matters more
than a great product.
