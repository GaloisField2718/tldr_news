NEWS & TRENDS

 FAVIKON ENGAGEMENT RATE BENCHMARK REPORT 2025 (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The global influencer marketing industry is expected to reach $32.55
billion in 2025 with a 33.11% growth rate, driven by increased brand
budgets and a shift toward smaller creators. Nano influencers
outperform larger creators across platforms, achieving top-quartile
engagement rates of 3.4%+ on Instagram, 2.4%+ on LinkedIn, and up to
800% spikes on TikTok. In contrast, mega influencers face sharp
engagement declines, with rates often below 1.8% across platforms. The
rise of AI influencers and synthetic engagement has made traditional
metrics unreliable, prompting brands to focus on authenticity and
relative benchmarking. Favikon's report, which analyzes over 8.3
million profiles, includes engagement benchmarks to help brands and
creators adapt to AI-driven challenges and prioritize quality
interactions.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT GTM TEAMS ARE DOING WITH CHATGPT (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ChatGPT is now a core tool in the modern GTM stack. In product
marketing, it supports persona research, positioning, and messaging
analysis. Content teams use it to summarize transcripts, localize
assets, and build SEO landing pages. Growth marketers apply it to
analyze paid spend, create employee social posts, and prioritize
experiments. Sales teams use it to personalize events, prepare for
calls, and extract insights from recordings. 

 OPERATIONALIZING YOUR TOPIC-FIRST SEO STRATEGY (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Shift focus from keywords to core topics tied to your brand's
offerings and audience needs. Start by mapping 5-10 parent topics,
then expand using personas, audience research, and zero-volume
subtopics to build authority. Create content that aligns with real
user problems and search intent. Organize internal and external links
by topic rather than recency. This deep, persona-driven coverage
builds visibility in search and AI-driven platforms, and creates a
self-reinforcing flywheel of topical authority.

 THE META REPORT: LESSONS FROM 640 HAUS INCREMENTALITY EXPERIMENTS (12
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 An analysis of 640 Meta incrementality tests over the last 18 months,
which included head-to-head tests that compared Advantage+ to Manual
campaigns, shows that Meta's automation consistently delivers
incremental impact. On average, it drove 19% lift to brands' primary
KPIs. Advantage+ campaigns identify high-intent users faster than
Manual campaigns but show 12% lower DTC iROAS on average due to
reduced long-term impact. Despite this, Advantage+ remains valuable
for new customer acquisition and short-term promotions, with 42% of
brands seeing it outperform Manual campaigns. Mid- and upper-funnel
strategies are gaining interest for their stronger omnichannel and
funnel-building effects, even though they underperform on DTC ROAS
alone. While Incremental Attribution is still in early stages with a
43% success rate, Meta's vast dataset gives it a strong foundation to
refine this tool and improve campaign efficiency. 

 FAKE FACES, REAL DRUGS: AI INFLUENCERS IN PHARMA ADVERTISING (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly using AI-generated
influencers to promote drugs in areas like dermatology and mental
health. These are synthetic personalities designed to mimic ideal
patients. While these avatars offer cost benefits, they also raise
concerns about accountability and gaps in regulation, as FDA oversight
of social media remains limited. In response, lawmakers are calling
for stricter rules. Experts advise clear disclosure, ethical
standards, and collaboration with real patients to keep AI-driven
marketing compliant.
