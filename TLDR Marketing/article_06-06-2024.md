more search results and spend more time looking for services now

 5 INFLUENCER MARKETING PREDICTIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Quick point-and-shoot product placements and fast fashion hauls are
becoming outdated in the influencer industry. This post predicts
upcoming shifts, including increased investment in influencer
marketing by 75% of B2B marketers. They will likely engage key leaders
and experts in niche industries and host campaigns on platforms like
LinkedIn. Brands will use their employees as brand ambassadors to
better connect with consumers. As social media usage declines,
influencers will gather loyal fans into more intimate digital spaces,
like brand forums or broadcast channels.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 STARTUP SEO: HOW TO BUILD A DEFENSIVE MOAT AS A STARTUP (28 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 SEO can help startups dominate a niche, attract high-intent leads,
and boost online brand visibility early. The biggest mindset shift
needed to succeed with startup SEO is realizing it's not about your
offering ‚Äì it's about your customers and what they're searching for.
Startups should prioritize search intent over product messaging,
create content that demonstrates E-E-A-T, implement on-page and
technical SEO best practices, and stay consistent with SEO
improvements. This article provides advice on building E-E-A-T,
content co-creation strategies, and SEO mistakes to avoid. 

 6 SAAS GROWTH TACTICS THAT GREW SUPADEMO TO $40K MRR IN 18 MONTHS (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Joseph Lee, the founder of Supademo, an AI-powered product demo tool,
shares growth tactics starting with a 4-step SaaS validation
framework. The framework involves problem identification, focus
definition, hypothesis development, and solution delivery. Supademo's
initial growth relied on unscalable tactics, such as manual outreach
and leveraging networks. Viral loops, accounting for 70% of Supademo's
acquisition, and SEO, contributing 20-25% of signups, were crucial
strategies. Sidecar products (complimentary free tools), co-marketing,
and reverse trials also drove growth. 

 HOW TO ACTUALLY ‚ÄòUSE AI TO WRITE YOUR BLOG POSTS' (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 AI can significantly reduce the time and effort needed to create
high-quality content marketing. The first step is to craft a detailed
prompt chain that works for your brand, explaining your company,
product, persona, voice, and any other important information. This can
then be used to have the AI pull out key ideas from existing content
(e.g. a webinar transcript), generate blog post ideas, produce an
outline, and then write each section one at a time. A human should
always fact-check and edit. This method can be used repeatedly to
create high-quality, on-brand content with actual original thinking
and thought leadership.

 5 COMMON EXAMPLES OF USELESS ACTIVATION MILESTONES (2 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This post covers five useless activation milestones that are either
too early or too late to be meaningful: sign-ups, completing
onboarding, five unspecified actions, revenue increases, and
conversion. These milestones do not accurately reflect user engagement
or value realization. Instead of chasing them, focus on impactful
milestones that predict user retention. Depending on the product, an
impactful activation milestone could be when a user collects survey
responses, gets a view on a created video, or listens to a significant
portion of content. 

 LINKEDIN ADDS NEW PREMIUM VIDEO AD PLACEMENT & MORE AI AD TOOLS (6
MINUTE READ) [11]

that will enable brands to run in-stream video ads alongside trusted
publisher content. The platform has partnered with a number of
high-profile publishers for the initiative, including Barron's,
Bloomberg, Business Insider, Forbes, MarketWatch, and NBCUniversal.
LinkedIn is also adding more AI capabilities to its ad tools,
including an ad creative generator, enhanced targeting, and an
improved AI assistant. 

 KLAVIYO LAUNCHES TIKTOK INTEGRATION TO BOOST AD EFFICIENCY AND DRIVE
HIGHER CONVERSIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [12]

businesses to sync their Klaviyo lists and segments to TikTok

 HOW GONG USES BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Gong, an AI-powered platform that captures and analyzes customer
lifecycle data, has reached more than 4,000 clients and become a
billion-dollar company. Rather than trying to position itself as a
solution in an established market category, the company created a new
one (revenue intelligence) and framed itself as ‚Äúthe undisputed
leader.‚Äù Gong uses AI to define the key points and best next steps
for its customers, which helps them get value quicker instead of
wasting energy organizing the data manually. It was one of the first
SaaS companies to leverage its team's personal brands to propel growth
- this cultivated a sense of unity within the industry and resulted in
massive marketing reach on LinkedIn. 

 SAY HELLO TO MY NEW AI MARKETER (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI agents are beginning to handle narrow end-to-end tasks
autonomously. AI-driven teams will eventually be able to manage
everything from market research to performance marketing and brand
campaigns based on a company's goals and budget inputs. This will
enhance personalization, allowing for 1:1 marketing that outperforms
traditional broad-audience approaches. Marketers will need to stay
ahead of AI developments and ensure they maintain oversight for
quality control.
