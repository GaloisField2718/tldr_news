NEWS & TRENDS

 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM KANTAR US MEDIA REACTIONS 2025 (4 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Streaming platforms lead US ad receptivity, with The New York Times,
Amazon, Apple TV, Netflix, and X ranking highest. Consumer openness to
ads rose to 58% from 47% last year. Marketer investment plans for 2026
favor podcasts and streaming, clashing with consumer interest in OOH,
sponsorships, and publications. Hispanic consumers show above-average
receptivity to Online Video and Stories. Over 70% of marketers use
generative AI, yet 60% of consumers distrust it. 

 PARENTHOOD BOOSTS SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE, STUDY FINDS (2 MINUTE READ) [6]


 59% of parents report higher social media use since having children.
Usage spikes around events like Black Friday, holidays, and
back-to-school. Parents also shop collaboratively with children, with
67% influenced by what kids see online. While parenthood fuels online
activity, brands are advised to target parents through their hobbies
and interests, not only their role as caregivers. 

 TIRED OF COOKIE CONSENT POP-UPS? YOU SOON MAY SEE LESS OF THEM (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 EU lawmakers are considering changes to the e-Privacy Directive that
triggered the constant cookie consent pop-ups online. Ideas include
browser-based consent settings or broader exceptions for essential
cookies, reducing the need for repeated prompts. Industry leaders are
pushing for alignment with GDPR's risk-based model, while privacy
groups raise concerns that data protections could be weakened.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RECOVER CHATGPT 404 TRAFFIC WITH GA4 (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ChatGPT drives high-converting traffic but often generates faulty
URLs, which can waste potential visits. An Ahrefs study found ChatGPT
5 links to error pages nearly three times more than Google Search. To
recover lost traffic, start by tracking ChatGPT-driven 404 pages in
Google Analytics using filters for session source and error page
titles. Next, create helpful 404 pages that guide visitors when they
land on hallucinated URLs. Use 301 redirects only for broken URLs that
generate measurable traffic. 

 HOW I VIBE CODED A SOCIAL FEED VIA LOVABLE (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A custom social feed was built by outlining a framework with features
like voting, saves, topic filters, timestamps, breaking news alerts,
and weekly reading stats. Lovable handled the technical build with
Supabase, PWA support, and responsive design, while conversational
feedback shaped iterations and aesthetics. Specific news and culture
sources were added, unwanted ones excluded, and a widget was placed on
the phone's homepage. The result is a curated, distraction-free
content hub distinct from traditional social media.

 TODAY: THE GEO & PR STRATEGIES THAT GET YOU FOUND IN CHATGPT & AI
SEARCH (WEBINAR) [11] 

 Go Fish Digital is hosting a webinar that will cover how brands can
get cited by top publications to boost brand visibility, SEO, and
inclusion in LLM responses. The panel will discuss how PR drives
visibility, the links and mentions that carry weight with LLMs, and
how to influence knowledge panels and entity-driven results. The event
takes place today at 2 pm ET. 

 TAPESTRY (TOOL) [12] 

 Tapestry is an app that gathers content from blogs, RSS feeds,
YouTube channels, and other sources into a single chronological
timeline. No algorithm interferes with the feed. It prioritizes
privacy with no tracking, allows muting of topics and spoilers across
feeds, and offers customization of layouts, fonts, and icons. 

 LINKEDIN INTRODUCES B2B ATTRIBUTION & ANALYTICS WITH MARKETING
PARTNERS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 LinkedIn's Company Intelligence API shifts B2B measurement from
lead-level tracking to company-level insights that reflect how real
buying decisions are made. Early adopters reported a 287% increase in
companies reached, 75% more MQLs, 96% more SQLs, and a 43% reduction
in acquisition costs. The tooling allows marketers to see the full
buyer journey, prioritize high-value accounts, improve attribution
accuracy, and link campaigns directly to pipeline growth and revenue.

 SOLVING BRAND TRADE-OFFS WITH PARADOXICAL PROMISES (7 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Brands often fall into the “Tyranny of the OR,” choosing
single-dimensional strategies rather than embracing paradoxical
promises that deliver both seemingly conflicting benefits.
Unsuccessful examples include Cracker Barrel returning to its original
premise and Jaguar abandoning its legacy for a new identity, each
potentially missing opportunities to balance heritage with innovation.
Research shows consumers dislike trade-offs that force them to
sacrifice something they value, preferring brands that satisfy
multiple, even contradictory, needs at once. Successful brands like
McDonald's, Apple, and Coke have grown by solving paradoxes rather
than choosing one side. 

 YOUR BRAIN ON CHATGPT (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This study examined the cognitive impact of using ChatGPT for essay
writing. It compared participants who used an LLM, a search engine, or
only their own brain across multiple sessions. EEG data revealed that
reliance on the LLM reduced neural connectivity and engagement
compared with the Brain-only and Search Engine groups, and
participants using the LLM showed weaker memory recall and lower
ownership of their work. While LLMs offer immediate assistance,
extended use may impair cognitive effort and learning skills.
