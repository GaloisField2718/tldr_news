 THE INSIDE TRACK ON GEN Z: DISCOVER WHAT YOUR FUTURE CUSTOMERS VALUE
(13 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 This report covers 10 insights into the preferences, attitudes, and
buying behaviors of Gen Z. With Gen Z being the largest demographic
group in the US, even a small segment of this population can
significantly impact brands. This group tends to be renters and faces
challenges in home ownership, shaping their purchasing behaviors.
Social media heavily influences their shopping habits, with loyalty
driven more by personal values and influencers' opinions than brand
identity. They also prefer mobile-first experiences and expect
seamless digital customer experiences from brands.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW A DYNAMIC TAGLINE INCREASED CONVERSIONS BY 15% FOR A WORLDWIDE
MEDIA BRAND (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Magazinesdirect.com, a subscription purchasing website, found from
user research that visitors didn't trust the website. In particular,
users didn't believe that the site was the official publisher of the
magazines they wanted to purchase. The brand tested adding a dynamic
tagline beneath the site logo that was unique to each individual
magazine landing page. Instead of ‚ÄòA Future Publishing Company', the
tagline read ‚ÄúThe official publisher of [Magazine Name]‚Äù. This
resulted in a 15% increase in conversions and a 28% increase in
revenue. 

 HOW TO USE PINTEREST AS A MARKETING TOOL (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This article shares 7 tips on leveraging Pinterest for both organic
brand awareness and paid acquisition. Recency isn't a large factor in
Pinterest's algorithm. You don't need to post a certain amount of
times per week to be seen. Bulk uploads work just as well. Optimize
the Pins you do have by writing useful descriptions with keywords your
target audience searches for and adding alternative text. Include
keywords in the Pin's title or image file name. Use Pinterest Trends
to see what keywords or topics drive traffic for your competitors.
These could be as niche as colors, styles, types of infographics, etc.
Lastly, add your products to Pinterest as product Pins. These are
shoppable from within the platform.

 COUNTER-POSITIONING: WHY YOUR BRAND NEEDS AN ENEMY TO GROW FASTER (6
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Counter-positioning is when you choose an enemy that helps customers
understand your difference and positions your brand as the obvious
alternative. BMW positioned itself as the ‚Äúultimate driving
machine‚Äù and contrasted itself against Mercedes by calling its
product the ‚Äúultimate sitting machine.‚Äù Mercedes was known for its
comfort so BMW reframed that strength as weakness. This campaign
enabled BMW to grow U.S. sales from 13,000 cars per year to 90,000 per
year.
