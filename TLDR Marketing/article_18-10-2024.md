NEWS & TRENDS

 NEARLY 80% OF CONSUMERS TRUST UGC MORE THAN INFLUENCERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 User Generated Content (UGC) outpaces influencer content in consumer
trust. Up to 79% of consumers say UGC impacts purchasing decisions
more than influencer posts, highlighting a growing preference for
authentic consumer-created content. The creator economy is projected
to grow to $250 billion by 2027, with 26% of U.S. adults aged 18-60
identifying as content creators. 

 AMERICANS' TRUST IN MEDIA REMAINS AT TREND LOW (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Trust in the U.S. media is at a record low, with only 31% of
Americans expressing confidence in its ability to report news
accurately and fairly. A larger share of adults (36%) have no trust at
all in the media, reflecting a trend of declining trust since the
1970s, particularly among Republicans and younger people. Local and
state governments are the most trusted institutions, while the federal
government, its branches, and the media are among the least trusted.
Trust is generally higher among older adults and Democrats, except for
the judicial branch where Republicans express more confidence.
Overall, many U.S. institutions are experiencing a crisis of public
confidence.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CHILI PIPER DOESN'T DO DISCOUNTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Chili Piper's no-discount approach relies on fully transparent
pricing published openly on its website. Unlike companies that
negotiate lower prices on a case-by-case basis, Chili Piper ensures
everyone pays the same rate. To achieve competitive and fair pricing,
it conducted a 500+ participant survey to gauge willingness to pay and
preferences for bundling products. This data-driven approach led to a
pricing calculator that accounts for per-user costs, platform fees,
and discounts for longer contracts. The pricing structure simplifies
complex factors while remaining accessible, with the price displayed
being the final cost for all customers. 

 WHAT MAKES ONLINE CONTENT VIRAL? THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND SHARES (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The "25 Years in Search" video by Google hit 353 million views by
triggering nostalgia, a proven motivator for sharing. Studies show
that people are more inclined to share content that reflects their
emotions or adds value to their social identity. Brands like AARP and
Home Depot successfully leverage that insight by combining practical
insights with emotional storytelling, which increases the chance of
going viral.

 BRANDS, ADS, AND VIDEO GAMES (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Brands are increasingly investing in gaming as a way to reach
younger, more engaged audiences. Games like Roblox, Minecraft, and
Fortnite attract massive user bases, surpassing traditional media in
influence. Early adopters like e.l.f. Beauty have seen success by
creating immersive experiences, while many brands still struggle to
adapt fully to the gaming space. The main challenge lies in committing
to long-term strategies rather than relying on one-off campaigns.
Collaboration with advertisers will become more important in shaping
the future of interactive entertainment as game companies seek new
revenue streams. 

 AMAZON WANTS TO MOVE BEYOND RETAIL MEDIA (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Amazon's unBoxed event highlighted its shift from retail media
dominance toward full-funnel advertising, signaling Amazon's ambition
to capture a larger slice of media budgets. The company's ads drive
conversions. Executives aim to position Amazon as a broader media
partner for all advertisers. This aligns with companies like Hasbro,
which focuses on brand building over immediate sales. 

 WHY GOOGLE SEARCH IS FALLING APART (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The decline in Google Search's user experience is driven by excessive
ads, blurred distinctions between ads and organic results, and
irrelevant content. AI integration and manipulative SEO tactics
further degrade result quality. Google's business model prioritizes ad
revenue over usability, leading to frustration.
