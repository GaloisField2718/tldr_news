 MARKETING METRICS DEMYSTIFIED (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Brand metrics like aided recall, share of voice, and brand sentiment
are often neglected in B2B SaaS but are integral at companies like
Salesforce and Zendesk. These metrics helped measure the impact of
marketing efforts on brand perception, a key factor in long-term
business growth. By tracking both brand and product-led growth
metrics, such as Daily Active Users and Product Qualified Leads,
marketing teams are able to drive both awareness and product adoption.


 CONTENT CLAPS BACK (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Content marketers are struggling with excessive workloads and a
scarcity mindset, leading to doubts about their own practices. To
manage this, they should document all tasks and meeting schedules to
facilitate discussions about prioritization and delegation. Training
team members to handle content creation can reduce individual workload
and increase overall efficiency. Providing resources and guidance for
others to create their own content helps maintain focus on
high-priority tasks.
