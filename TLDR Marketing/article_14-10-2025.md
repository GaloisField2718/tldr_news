NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE SAYS AUSTRALIAN LAW ON TEEN SOCIAL MEDIA USE 'EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT' TO ENFORCE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google said Australia's new law banning social media for people under
16 will be hard to enforce and won't improve online safety. The law,
effective in December, requires platforms to estimate users' ages with
AI instead of verifying them. Google argued it could cause unintended
effects and said YouTube shouldn't be treated as a social platform.
Australia will be the first country to impose such a ban. 

 HUGE PROPORTION OF YOUNG AMERICANS NOW REPORTING SERIOUS COGNITIVE
ISSUES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cognitive issues among Americans aged 18-39 have nearly doubled from
5.1% to 9.7% over the past decade. The sharpest increases appeared
among people earning under $35K, those without a high school diploma,
and Indigenous Americans. Researchers point to factors like economic
stress, inequality, and technology use, warning that the trend could
affect long-term health and productivity.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT TO DO WITH IG'S LATEST UPDATES (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Instagram keeps changing, so social teams need to prioritize DMs with
Broadcast Channels and Manychat. Carousels and Stories should be
posted consistently to maintain audience habits. Every Reel needs to
act as an introduction to the brand, reaching new eyes rather than
existing followers. 

 THE BEST MARKETING IDEAS FROM THE PAST 7 DAYS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Smart design and psychology can turn marketing into participation.
Youform and Crisp use prompt-engineered “Ask AI” buttons to fake
transparency and build trust. OpenAI rewards loyalty with collectible
coins that spark social proof. Nespresso turns its decaf claim into a
game customers can test. A dark-mode programming book wins by
mirroring developer culture. And “Draw a Fish” drives viral growth
through fast, shareable creation. Each example earns attention by
letting people engage, not just observe.

 DOES QUORA MARKETING STILL WORK? YES. HERE'S 5 NEW IDEAS (17 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Quora ranks for over 191M keywords and is frequently cited in
AI-generated search results. With 410M monthly organic visitors, the
platform aligns user intent with content structure, as visitors
typically look for specific answers during mid-funnel research.
Content that follows a structured format, such as answer, explanation,
example, and takeaway, has a higher likelihood of being extracted by
AI platforms. Quora Spaces serve as thematic repositories for
educational content, and paid tools like Promoted Answers and Lead Gen
Forms support on-platform engagement and data capture.

 FIRST COMES THE INNOVATOR, THEN COMES THE INNOVATIVE MARKETER (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Innovation alone doesn't sustain market leadership. Brands win by
pairing it with marketing innovation. SharkNinja outpaced Dyson by
investing 20-25% of revenue in agile marketing versus Dyson's 2-4%.
Similarly, Alo and Fabletics surpass Lululemon through storytelling
and influencer strategy. The strongest brands blend product and
marketing innovation through collaboration and adaptability. 

 YOU'RE PAYING YOUR SALES AND MARKETING TEAMS TO SABOTAGE EACH OTHER
(6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Too many orgs reward marketing for quantity and sales for quality,
setting them up to clash and fail. Instead, focus on bringing
high-fit, high-LTV leads that sales can confidently close. Tactics
include passing product usage insights back into content and
campaigns, and syncing on a shared success metric like pipeline
velocity. Real alignment means using sales feedback within 48 hours
and creating evergreen marketing loops powered by real customer data. 

 META ADS PIXEL TRACKING, EXPLAINED (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Meta Pixel improves ad performance by tracking user actions and
sending data back to Meta Ads for optimization. One merchant increased
its conversion rate from 0.3% to 27.0% after correctly setting up the
pixel, showing how vital accurate tracking is. Shopify integrates the
Meta Pixel and Meta's Conversion API to measure results, identify
target audiences, and refine ad strategies based on real purchase
data.
