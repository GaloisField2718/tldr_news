NEWS & TRENDS

 LABUBUS, GEN Z, AND THE COLLECTION OBSESSION (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Labubu craze shows Gen Z's fixation on collectible trinkets as
symbols of identity, nostalgia, and affordable luxury. Rather than
toys for play, Labubus are customized, displayed, and shared online.
They're now social and aesthetic statements. Limited editions,
influencer endorsements, and platform-driven hype fuel demand and
overconsumption. Like Beanie Babies or Tamagotchis, they tap into
emotional buying habits, but today's trends move faster due to digital
culture. Collectibles now function more as lifestyle markers than
playthings. 

 MORE ADVERTISEMENTS ARE COMING TO GOOGLE AI MODE (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google is encouraging advertisers to buy ads in its AI Mode, which
integrates sponsored text and shopping ads into AI-powered search
results. These ads appear in banners under AI responses and are
currently labeled as an experiment. Google has already begun rolling
out these ads and claims to have seen strong performance.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 B2B LEAD GENERATION SEO: HOW TO GET 20X THE CONVERSION RATE (10
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 B2B SEO works best when targeting high-intent keywords rather than
top-of-funnel traffic. These keywords can convert up to 20X better,
with category terms converting at 3.2%, comparison keywords at 8.4%,
and jobs-to-be-done terms up to 12.5%. SEO should be measured by leads
from content pages, with results typically seen in 3-6 months and
accelerated by link building, PPC, and content promotion. 

 YOU HAVE TOO MANY METRICS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Only track metrics that prompt action when outside expected bounds.
Because they are costly to set up and maintain, each must justify its
existence. Effective metrics are reviewed regularly, have clear
expectations, and trigger responses when they deviate. Without this,
metrics become noise or vanity data. A small set of well-maintained,
actionable metrics is more valuable than large dashboards of unused
numbers.

 30+ AI VISIBILITY TOOLS THAT TRACK YOUR BRAND IN CHATGPT AND LLMS (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Traffic from generative AI has grown 165X faster than traditional
organic search. The fast growth is driving high demand for AI
visibility tools, which track how brands appear in responses from
platforms like ChatGPT, AI Overviews, and Perplexity. Companies are
adopting both legacy SEO platforms with LLM add-ons and standalone
tools (ie. Otterly, RankRaven, and Profound) to measure share of
voice, brand mentions, and sentiment across AI-generated content. 

 GOOGLE ADS ADDS ‘LOCATIONS OF INTEREST' TARGETING TO AI MAX FOR
SEARCH (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google Ads introduced “Locations of Interest” for AI Max for
Search campaigns. It lets advertisers target users based on the
geographic areas they are interested in, not just where they currently
are. It is an optional setting at the ad group level and allows
multiple locations of interest that can differ from the overall
campaign targeting. It also brings advanced location intent targeting,
previously available in Display and YouTube campaigns, to Search
campaigns.

 ELON MUSK SAYS HE'S BRINGING BACK VINE'S ARCHIVE (2 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Elon Musk announced that X has recovered the original Vine video
archive, which was believed to be lost after the platform shut down in
2016. Vine, known for its six-second looping videos, played a major
role in early short-form content and launched the careers of many
digital creators. The archive's return was shared alongside the
promotion of Grok Imagine, an AI-driven video generation tool
available to X Premium+ users. 

 THE RISE AND FALL OF PRIME - LOGAN PAUL AND KSI'S MARKETING MADNESS
(4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Launched by Logan Paul and KSI in 2022, Prime Hydration became a Gen
Alpha status symbol through artificial scarcity, viral stunts, and
social media hype. Bottles were resold for hundreds as kids treated
launches like exclusive drops. However, once Prime became widely
available, its appeal faded and sales dropped sharply. The brand
lacked the fundamentals—product quality, loyalty, and consistent
demand—that support long-term success. While influencer marketing
can drive quick wins, lasting brands require more than visibility and
hype.
