 HUNDREDS OF CREATORS SIGN LETTER SLAMMING META‚ÄôS LIMIT ON POLITICAL
CONTENT (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Since March, Instagram and Threads have instituted a new default
setting that limits political content you see from people you‚Äôre not
following. Hundreds of creators, convened by GLAAD and Accountable
Tech, have signed an open letter demanding that Instagram make the
political content limit an opt-in feature, rather than on by default.
Instagram describes political content as anything related to laws,
elections, or social topics. For political creators, these limits
impact their livelihood since they make it harder for them to reach
new audiences. 

 BIPARTISAN FEDERAL BILL SEEKS TO STANDARDIZE US PRIVACY PROTECTIONS
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA)
have unveiled the American Privacy Rights Act (APRA), a bipartisan
data privacy proposal that could fundamentally alter the US consumer
privacy landscape. The bill, if passed, would give consumers the right
to opt out of targeted advertising, allow them to delete any data that
was collected about them, and create a federal data broker registry.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY DOES BRITISH AIRWAYS SPEND SO MUCH ON ADS THAT AREN‚ÄôT DESIGNED
TO SELL FLIGHTS? (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 British Airways recently dropped a new outdoor ad campaign, Windows,
that captures the wonder felt by passengers peering out the window at
35,000 feet. There‚Äôs no slogan, no website, and no call to action
‚Äî instead, the ads sell a feeling. Brand marketing like this can
effectively sell value because it focuses on customer experience and
expectations. BA‚Äôs advertising strategy is to get in a consumer‚Äôs
head before the price comparison game begins. If the brand were to
focus on its amenities in its advertising instead, then it risks
inviting the pricing concerns earlier. 

 SHOULD YOU USE ADVERBS IN YOUR MARKETING COPY? (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Beginner writers tend to pack as much as possible into one sentence,
hoping it will evoke some kind of feeling or reaction. Meanwhile,
experienced writers avoid adverbs and adjectives because they‚Äôre
less forceful than nouns and verbs. Adverbs are effective when they
add to the meaning of the copy and are not just empty placeholders.
This article includes two examples of ads where adverbs added value to
the ad copy.

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MIMETIC DESIRE (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Mimetic Desire is when people want something because they believe
others also want it. This is why marketers use models or examples to
show the desirability of their product or service. To create Mimetic
Desire, brands can embrace popular trends, as Apple did when releasing
iPhones in Pantone‚Äôs Color of the Year ‚Äî twice. They can also lean
into selling an experience instead of a product, as luxury car brands
often do. Social proof with tangible examples of results is a tried
and true way to show customers why your product is desirable. 

 THE MISSING LINK BETWEEN PLG AND SLG (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In this interview, the global head of CX at Miro discusses the need
to move beyond the traditional debate between sales-led growth (SLG)
and product-led growth (PLG). A unified approach that combines
elements from both can create a seamless customer experience while
increasing resource efficiency. At Miro, this approach involved
integrating customer education, content production, and scaled
customer success into a single team focused on the whole customer
journey. The team succeeded in driving sustainable business growth in
the challenging SaaS landscape by prioritizing agility, collaboration,
and data-driven decisions. 

 WHY THE KEY TO GREAT CREATIVE IS GREAT CREATIVE STRATEGY (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 The focus on creative strategy is often overshadowed by the rush to
execute campaigns. However, creative strategy is crucial for driving
brand success. A clear brief reduces wasted time, unnecessary testing,
and personal biases. Briefs that contain a ‚Äúhigh definition
strategy‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt leave space for creativity to blossom. Every
element stipulated in the brief should work towards the same end goal,
saying what it needs to say to the right audiences in a compelling and
culturally relevant way.
