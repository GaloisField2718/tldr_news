NEWS & TRENDS

 META IS EARNING A FORTUNE ON A DELUGE OF FRAUDULENT ADS, DOCUMENTS
SHOW (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta earns billions from scam ads. 10% of its 2024 revenue (about $16
billion) was tied to fraudulent or banned ads. Users see 15B high-risk
scam ads daily, and many suspicious advertisers remain active unless
fraud is nearly certain, sometimes paying higher rates instead of
being banned. Lenient policies, algorithmic amplification, and
high-value accounts worsen the problem. Meta plans to gradually reduce
this through measures like penalty bids. 

 ‘A SAFE BET': BRANDS ARE DIGGING INTO THEIR AD ARCHIVES FOR
CREATIVE INSPIRATION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Brands are revisiting their archives to recreate past campaigns for
today's audiences. They're leaning on nostalgia and existing fandoms
to reconnect with consumers. Gushers turned its '90s “Fruitheads”
ad into a short horror film, Pringles updated its “Once You Pop”
tagline, Columbia Sportswear drew on early extreme-product-testing
spots, and Acuvue partnered with a creator to revive a mid-2000s
campaign. The key is modernizing the work so it feels relevant rather
than dated.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO ANSWER 3 BIG, SCARY ANNUAL PLANNING QUESTIONS (IN DAYS, NOT
MONTHS) (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Draft an annual marketing plan by addressing 3 core questions about
growth strategy, budget, and revenue targets. Choose 3-5 strategic
“big bets” and document each with a GACCS Brief for clarity.
Estimate a budget range using GTM efficiency metrics such as CAC
ratio, payback period, or LTV to CAC. Validate revenue targets with a
bottom-up forecast using realistic conversion rates and lead or
account data to ensure top-down goals are achievable. 

 HOW TO BUILD AND RUN A BILLBOARD CAMPAIGN (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 For a strong OOH campaign, target locations where your customers
live, work, and commute. Use multiple formats like billboards, panels,
transit ads, street furniture, and digital boards. Plan 3-6 months
ahead and align stakeholders. Keep the messaging simple and easy to
read. Focus on peak engagement periods and map audience hotspots.
Repeat consistent messaging across all placements to create a
memorable brand presence.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO RUN VISUAL QUERY FAN-OUT ANALYSIS IN SCREAMING FROG USING
OPENAI (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google's new “visual search fan-out” uses AI to analyze image
details and generate related search queries, expanding SEO beyond
keywords. A custom Screaming Frog tool powered by OpenAI's Vision API
mimics this process, revealing missed optimization opportunities by
detecting overlooked objects, styles, and attributes. Tests show many
e-commerce images lack context for visual elements like color,
material, or use case, limiting visibility. Adding these insights to
alt text, descriptions, and on-page content can boost search reach. 

 GOOGLE'S BIGGEST PERFORMANCE MAX UPDATE YET (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google's PMax update introduces asset-level reporting, providing
visibility into which headlines, images, and videos drive clicks and
conversions. Advertisers can now identify top performers and replace
underperforming creatives without resetting campaign learning.
Alongside this update, built-in AI video tools allow teams to
auto-generate short-form videos from existing brand assets. This
allows broader reach across placements like YouTube and Display
without requiring in-house production.

 EVERGREEN VS. LAUNCH MARKETING (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Evergreen marketing provides steady revenue and long-term growth,
while launches generate quick cash and market momentum. Evergreen
works best for consistent offers like SaaS, retainers, or memberships.
Launches suit timed products such as bootcamps, cohorts, or drops,
offering fast visibility but higher risk. Combining both by running
evergreen systems for predictable revenue and adding 3-4 launches per
year creates urgency and drives new demand. 

 A MORE ACCURATE WAY TO MEASURE CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT (10 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 The “attention equation” shows that monetization depends more on
focus quality than time spent. Mobile games and premium video drive
strong engagement but are underused due to weak ad formats. Social
video on TikTok and YouTube delivers high satisfaction even when
watched alone. Matching content to user intent and channel behavior
leads to better results than prioritizing screen time.
