 HOW CHATGPT CITES SOCIAL MEDIA (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Social media continues to play a growing role in AI sourcing. Reddit
dominates with 3-4% of all citations, 99% of which are individual
threads rather than profiles. YouTube and LinkedIn reward authority,
with 65% of YouTube citations pointing to channels and 47% of LinkedIn
citations to personal profiles. Instagram favors content, as reels and
posts make up 65% of citations versus 30% for profiles. 

 CONSUMERS WILL ACCEPT ADS IN AI CHATBOTS, BUT TRUST ISSUES REMAIN (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A Forrester poll in the US, UK, and Canada found that 83% would
accept ads in AI chatbot free tiers, while only 6% would switch to a
paid tier to avoid ads. OpenAI expects ads to help cover about $1.4tr
in computing costs and projects that 8.5% of users (about 220 million
people) will pay for an ad-free plan, while Anthropic is avoiding ads
and targeting enterprise buyers. Trust in large tech companies is
falling (from 32% to 24% since 2020), and concern is growing that ads
could influence chatbot answers. 

 CYCLICAL EVENTS TO BOOST 2026 AD SPEND, BUT RECESSION, TARIFF
CONCERNS REMAIN (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 US ad spend is projected to increase 9.5% in 2026, with $9 billion in
incremental dollars tied to midterms, the Winter Olympics, and the
FIFA World Cup. Social and CTV will lead channel expansion at 14.6%
and 13.8% YoY as buyers prioritize scalable, measurable environments.
Economic risk persists with a one-in-three chance of recession, and
90% of buyers are concerned about tariffs, though those cutting spend
due to tariffs fell from 45% to 30% YoY as budgets shift toward
performance media. Rising acquisition costs have reduced its strategic
weight by 10 points, yet 54% still rank new customer growth as a top
objective.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LEAD SCORING TIP (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Brands overcomplicate lead scoring by combining revenue potential and
likelihood to close into one number. The better approach is to keep
them separate. Use revenue potential to tier leads based on size or
deal value, and use conversion likelihood driven by firmographic fit
and engagement signals to score them. Focus on the few factors that
actually correlate with closed deals. 

 GOOGLE TELLS ADVERTISERS TO DUMP GRANULAR CAMPAIGNS FOR AI (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The guidance represents a reversal of a decade of search best
practices that rewarded tight segmentation and manual optimization.
Google's position is that AI models can process real-time auction
dynamics and contextual data at a scale no human team can match. Early
adopters reportedly see improved conversion rates after consolidation,
but marketers will give up granular reporting and tighter control for
algorithmic performance gains that are harder to report and explain.

 HOW TO CREATE FAQS AT SCALE WITH SCREAMING FROG + OPENAI API (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 FAQ sections help pages perform better for AI search because they
pack high-similarity answers into very little text. Research that
compared dense prose, FAQs, and structured content across five queries
and multiple models showed that FAQ content had the highest similarity
scores in almost all cases. AI systems often work under a grounding
budget of about 2K words per query, so compact FAQ blocks are easier
for them to process and reuse. Screaming Frog connects to the OpenAI
API and can generate FAQs at scale by crawling pages and sending page
text to a model, and one test produced 150%+ FAQs in about five
minutes. AI-generated FAQs work best on longer pages and still need
human review before publishing.

February 18 that will feature 25+ DTC and ecommerce leaders sharing
growth tactics. It includes three hands-on breakout sessions, plus a
rapid-fire lightning panel of 10 experts. The event is designed for
operators seeking real-world guidance, not theory.

 DEATH TO LEAD MAGNETS! ALL HAIL SATELLITE APPS (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI coding tools now let marketers build free, lightweight satellite
apps that replace static lead magnets and drive growth across the full
funnel. These micro-apps give instant value, require little
maintenance, and connect users directly to the main product through
demos, calculators, benchmarks, and interactive reports instead of
gated PDFs. Tools that once took weeks or months and full engineering
teams can now be built in hours or days by one person. Companies
report strong results such as high traffic, new signups, and
cross-activation into core products from ungated tools like AI
visibility and product benchmark apps. The approach works best when
the core product relies on unique data, network effects, or trust,
since simple point solutions can now be easily recreated. 

 I TRIED MCDONALD'S MCNUGGET CAVIAR PROMOTION (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 McDonald's launched the limited-time McNugget Caviar kit before
Valentine's Day after a viral high low trend. It was inspired by a
$100 nugget and caviar dish at the 2025 US Open. The free kit included
Baerii sturgeon caviar, crème fraîche, a mother-of-pearl spoon, and
a $25 nugget voucher. The promotion hits a sweet spot by being free
and culturally valuable. It lets a $5 meal chain wink at a $100 dish
while inviting fans to play along.
