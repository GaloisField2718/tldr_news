MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Twitch Adpocalypse, marked by declining ad revenue for top

controversial content. Twitch's limited ad targeting capabilities and
weak reporting systems make it less appealing to advertisers, leading
to a sharp drop in revenue for streamers. As a result, many are
exploring alternative platforms like Kick or YouTube.

they think, making emotion the key to long-term growth.
