NEWS & TRENDS

 THE K-SHAPED ECONOMY IS HERE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The K-shaped economy is no longer theoretical. A small, wealthy
segment now drives most consumer spending, while the majority is
pulling back, erasing the middle market. Premium shoppers continue to
buy high-end and safe-haven goods, while value-focused consumers
prioritize trade-downs and dupes. Even traditional affordable luxuries
are slipping as budgets tighten. The idea of an average consumer no
longer holds. Brands must choose a clear position at either the
premium or value end. 

 OPENAI REPORTEDLY PLANNING TO MAKE CHATGPT “PRIORITIZE”
ADVERTISERS IN CONVERSATION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ChatGPT may soon include advertising content within its
conversational interface, placing sponsored responses above
informational ones in some cases. OpenAI teams have explored formats
that delay ad exposure until a second user prompt to avoid immediate
pushback. Early designs reference ad carousels and feature-based
promotions embedded in dialogue. As AI tools begin to function as
digital assistants and research companions, brands are looking for
ways to appear contextually relevant without disrupting trust.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HUMOR WORKS FOR B2B TOO (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Humor in B2B ads can make people like the ad and the brand more,
especially when the humor connects to the product and the audience is
not rushed. Experiments found that funny B2B ads improved attitudes
toward the ad by 19.9%, improved attitudes toward the brand by 17.9%,
and increased the chance of people searching for more information by
8.6%. In another test, a funny cleaning service ad led to 19.3% better
brand attitudes among people who were not in a hurry. The effect works
best when the humor relates directly to the product, weakens when
people are busy, and does not help much if the audience is already a
customer. 

 CONTACT US VS. CONTACT SALES (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A high-impact website tweak is splitting a generic “Contact Us”
into specific options like “Contact Sales” and “Contact
Support”. Tests show this can noticeably increase clicks and
qualified inquiries.

 CHATGPT IS A SEARCH ENGINE. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS (20 MINUTE READ) [11]


 ChatGPT functions like a search engine that gathers and filters live
web data before GPT 5.2 writes the response. It first uses a tiny
classifier to decide if the query needs search using thresholds such
as 0.2 and 0.4. A faster model called Thinky runs multiple searches
and cuts results from about 50 candidates to about 10 to 20, and then
to about 3 to 5 sources. Pages must load in roughly 2 seconds or they
are dropped. The final model then reads the top content chunks and
produces the answer after a process that often adds about 5 seconds of
ideal latency. 

 A 52-WEEK LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE FOR 2026 (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Allison Stadd, CMO of Ollie, shares a low-lift 52-week leadership
challenge that uses music-inspired prompts to help leaders lead with
more creativity and curiosity. 

 WHEN IT COMES TO CREATIVITY, AI DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE THE ANSWER (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Fast answers from AI can weaken creative thinking if users accept
responses without challenging them. In a creativity test, students
scored higher when they avoided shortcuts and developed their own
approaches. AI users who asked how to think rather than what to think
improved their performance. When teams combined human collaboration
with AI-guided strategy, their creativity scores rose. AI should be
used as a thinking partner that supports exploration instead of
delivering finished ideas.
