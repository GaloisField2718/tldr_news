NEWS & TRENDS

 FROM PEPSICO TO TACO BELL, DIRTY SODA IS TAKING OVER (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Dirty soda, a mix of soda with cream, syrups, and other flavorings,
grew from a Utah-based Swig into a national trend that is revitalizing
the sluggish soft drink category. Popularized by TikTok and reality
TV, it has spread from soda shops to restaurants, grocery aisles, and
fast-food chains like McDonald's and Taco Bell. Beverage giants such
as PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper are launching ready-to-drink versions,
as they see it as a way to attract younger consumers. 

 NIKESKIMS: THE BUSINESS & LEGAL ARCHITECTURE BEHIND THE NEW BRAND (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 NikeSKIMS merges Nike's performance expertise with SKIMS' knowledge
of fit and cultural relevance. It's a new activewear category rather
than just a line of leggings and sports bras under a shared logo.
Likely structured as a licensing deal, Nike owns all intellectual
property, including creative assets, trademarks, and design patents,
while any co-branded items would need SKIMS marks removed if the deal
ends. The venture leverages Nike's talent, manufacturing, and IP
alongside SKIMS' brand equity and retail network.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 USE ICONS FOR PRICING PAGE LINE ITEMS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Using checkmarks or bullets on pricing pages makes features easier to
skim, but too many icons can blend together. Dropbox improves
readability by combining concise line items with hover boxes that
explain vague or technical terms. This helps users quickly understand
offerings without getting lost in jargon. 

 THIS VIRAL CREATOR IS ACTUALLY A BRAND (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Opal's TikTok account, Olivia Unplugged, scaled to 8M views in 30
days by using a personality-led format and data-informed content
themes like sleep and burnout. Its team tested over 40 videos before
finding breakout success with a “green whiteboard” storytelling
style that made complex topics digestible and repeatable. Scripts were
informed by peer-reviewed research and audience pain points. Opal's
branding remained very subtle but consistent.

 INTRODUCING CHATGPT PULSE (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Pulse is a new feature that proactively delivers personalized daily

chats, feedback, and optional integrations like Gmail and Google
Calendar, then presents the results as visual cards that can be
scanned or opened for detail. Curation and quick feedback refine what
appears, making Pulse more tailored over time.

 11 HARD TRUTHS ABOUT WORKING IN GROWTH (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Growth work is relentless as targets constantly shift, loops
collapse, and organizational silos block progress. Sustainable growth
comes from strong products and retention. 80% of value in top
companies comes from existing customers, while the median product
loses 96% of new users by month 3. Growth teams face high turnover
since only 10% of experiments last a year, and attribution data is
often misleading because human behavior cannot be reduced to a single
metric. At scale, growth becomes more about optimization than
invention, while in younger companies, it's more experimental. 

 PATAGONIA'S $3 BILLION GIVEAWAY (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Patagonia restructured its $3B company so all profits fund
environmental causes. The Patagonia Purpose Trust holds 2% of voting
stock to safeguard the mission. The Holdfast Collective owns 98% of
non-voting stock and directs about $100 million a year to nature
protection. This authenticity made Patagonia America's most reputable
company in 2023. It also allows premium pricing, as purchases are
directly tied to climate action. Patagonia stands out as the only
outdoor brand fully aligned with its mission.
