NEWS & TRENDS

 AMERICANS NOW USE SOCIAL MEDIA AS THEIR PRIMARY NEWS SOURCE, RESEARCH
SHOWS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Since 2013, social media as a news source in the US has doubled from
27% to 54%. It is now ahead of TV and online news sites. Weekly video
consumption is high, with 72% watching online news content. The shift
is most rapid among 18- to 24-year-olds, marking a fundamental change
in how information is consumed. The trend is more pronounced in
regions like Latin America and Southeast Asia, but not as much in
Europe and Japan. 

 HOW AI TOOLS COLLECT YOUR DATA ACROSS DEVICES (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI tools often collect behavioral data (i.e. clicks, scrolls, and
hovers) to power recommendations, ads, and automations. However, the
way they gather and interpret this information isn't always obvious. A
lot of this data is inferred rather than explicitly given, which can
lead to flawed assumptions. Brands should be cautious about relying
too heavily on AI outputs without understanding where the data comes
from and how it's labeled. Decisions based on shallow engagement data
can create feedback loops, where mediocre content gets reinforced
simply because it aligns with past low-effort interactions. Those
using AI in content or customer experience should push for more
transparency, ask what signals are being collected, and recognize that
true intent isn't always reflected in surface-level behavior.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO PUT ON A VIRTUAL EVENT PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO ATTEND (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Focus on creating a seamless experience from registration to
post-event content when hosting virtual events. Use a simple signup
form and a landing page that clearly shows the value, speaker lineup,
and agenda. Treat the event like a show, not a meeting. Add branded
visuals, music, giveaways, and interactive features like live chat and
Q&As to keep energy high. Plan your sessions with repurposing in mind
so they become podcast episodes, social clips, and follow-up emails.
Track campaign performance, drop-off points, and audience engagement
to refine future events. 

 THE POWER OF INTERACTIVE CONTENT (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Interactive content formats including image sliders, assessments, and
interactive videos help marketers increase content effectiveness by
creating immersive experiences that invite user action. These formats
not only enhance storytelling but also simplify complex decisions,
such as selecting a product or understanding cost implications. As
tools for building interactive content become more accessible, brands
of all sizes are integrating these tactics into their strategy to
elevate engagement, collect valuable first-party data, and strengthen
their digital presence. 

 TO SLANT. OR NOT TO SLANT (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Consumer perception shifts with text tilt. Upward angles evoke energy
and movement, while downward angles suggest calm and ease. Researchers
found shoppers were significantly more likely to buy products when the
text direction matched the product's intended emotional outcome,
influencing both purchase intent and post-purchase satisfaction. The
visual orientation triggered subconscious associations that impacted
performance across ads, packaging, and landing pages.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 REDDIT WILL HELP ADVERTISERS TURN ‘POSITIVE' POSTS INTO ADS (1
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Reddit is launching a new feature for advertisers that slots positive
posts from Reddit users right under their ads. The new feature, called
Conversation Summary Add-ons, dynamically integrates positive content
from Reddit users directly below an advertiser's creative. 

 MAKING IT EASIER TO CREATE VIDEOS ON FACEBOOK (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Facebook is merging all videos into the Reels format, removing the
need to choose between posting a video or a reel. Audience controls
remain intact, so users can still decide who sees their content. The
Video tab will now be called the Reels tab, but content variety and
recommendations won't change. Past videos will stay where they are,
while all future video posts will automatically be shared as reels.
These updates will roll out gradually across profiles and Pages.

 UNHINGED MARKETING HAS GONE MAINSTREAM, BUT CONSUMERS CRAVE HONESTY
(4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 As unhinged marketing becomes more common across social platforms,
its ability to differentiate brands has weakened, with only 23% of
consumers viewing it as genuinely bold. Brands that succeed are those
that reflect a clear and consistent identity across all customer
touchpoints, focusing on transparency and authenticity rather than
manufactured chaos and short-term virality. 

 RYAN HASHEMI ON WHAT IT MEANS TO BUILD AND BACK THE NEXT WAVE OF
CREATOR-LED COMPANIES (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Ryan Hashemi, founder of Snowball, helps brands build strong internal
YouTube teams by bridging the gap between corporate marketing and
creator-driven content. Many brands rely on agencies or in-house teams
that lack a clear YouTube strategy. Snowball focuses first on making
content people love before tying it to business goals. It hires
storytellers rather than traditional YouTube experts. It also applies
creator economy principles to shift brands from costly ads toward
building loyal audiences through organic content. The vision is for
brands to become content studios that tell stories and own their
audiences.
