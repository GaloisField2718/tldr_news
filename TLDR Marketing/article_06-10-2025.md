 THAT MEETING SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOOM. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Feel like you're drowning in feedback sessions, creative reviews, and
stakeholder updates? You're not alone: research from Enterprise
Strategy Group shows 78% of employees struggle with meeting overload
[4], and 51% regularly work overtime just to catch up

A shinier meeting tool isn't going to get you that time back - but
Loom [5] will.

Use async video communication to replace status meetings, speed up
review cycles, and keep campaigns moving across time zones. Record
your screen, get feedback, and let AI generate summaries and action
items.

More time for deep work. Less "this meeting should have been an
email."

Record your first Loom for free [5].

NEWS & TRENDS

 THE STATE OF CREATOR MARKETING (19 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Creator marketing has entered the “Era of Efficacy”. Budgets rose
171% YoY as brands redirect funds from digital advertising to
influencer partnerships, with 71% of organizations increasing
investment. The focus is on ROI, creator fit, operational maturity,
and long-term relationships rather than follower counts. Industry
leaders report more than double the ROI by centralizing programs and
involving larger teams. 

 CAN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS EXTRACT CUSTOMER NEEDS AS WELL AS
PROFESSIONAL ANALYSTS? (38 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LLMs can make market research faster, cheaper, and more insightful. A
hybrid LLM-human approach produced detailed qualitative data and
matched humans in identifying key ideas and themes, but showed less
diversity and consistency in quantitative responses. With human
oversight and company data, LLMs do offer a low-cost way to generate
insights across all stages of research.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW ONE SMALL EXPERIMENT DROVE A +24% LIFT IN SEO IMPRESSIONS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Webflow added automated FAQs with schema markup to 6 key feature
pages using an AI workflow built in AirOps. The system mined real user
questions from Google's “People Also Ask”, Reddit, and niche
forums. It then filled content gaps and structured answers for search
engines. This led to 331 new AI citations and a 24% lift in SEO
impressions, with gains across nearly all tracked queries. 

 EMAIL SEGMENTATION TIP (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When resending emails to non-openers, include a condition to target
only those who have opened one of the last few campaigns. This ensures
messages reach engaged recipients and avoids emailing inactive
contacts.

 DOES X PREMIUM REALLY BOOST YOUR REACH? AN ANALYSIS OF 18M+ POSTS (5
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 X Premium posts get far more visibility and engagement than regular
user posts. Premium accounts average 10X more reach per post, while
Premium+ users see over twice the reach of standard Premium.
Engagement rates are higher across Premium tiers at 0.49% to 0.55%,
compared to 0% for regular accounts. Text and video posts perform
best, while link posts are penalized, especially for non-Premium
users. 

 HOW TO BECOME A BETTER COPYWRITER (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Focus on writing that drives revenue, not on sounding eloquent. Talk
to customers or sales teams to understand pain points, objections, and
language. Study competitors' ads to find proven messages and keep a
swipe file of strong examples. Specialize in one platform, learn its
algorithm, and track ROI. 

 THE GAP MARKETING: A DEEP DIVE INTO THEIR REVIVAL (8 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Gap rebuilt its brand identity by shifting from a mall staple to a
cultural storyteller. New leadership focused on creativity and
cultural relevance while campaigns with Tyla, Troye Sivan, and KATSEYE
connected emotionally and visually with Gen Z. Gap also co-created
products with influencers like Julia Huynh and made social content
feel organic rather than promotional. The results showed up in sales
and earned media.
