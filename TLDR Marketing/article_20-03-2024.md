 LOOM‚ÄôS BILLION-DOLLAR GROWTH LOOP (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Loom was acquired for $975M by Atlassian and had been growing >500%
YoY. It achieved this by designing an effective growth loop ‚Äî a
mechanism where inputs generate some output, and outputs can be
reinvested as inputs. As new users join, they create videos and share
them with others, which prompts new signups and restarts the loop.
This enables UGC, leverages social sharing to build trust, and turns
existing users into acquisition channels. This post briefly covers
growth loops from companies like Netflix, Dropbox, and Airtable.
