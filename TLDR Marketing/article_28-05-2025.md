NEWS & TRENDS

 THE PLATFORM 92% OF SOCIAL MARKETERS CONSIDER A PRIORITY (6 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 A survey of social media marketers found that Instagram is still the
top priority for most (92%), followed surprisingly by LinkedIn (52%),
then TikTok (50%). TikTok is considered the hardest platform to
succeed on by 32.5% of respondents, while Instagram's flexibility
makes it the top choice if marketers had to pick only one platform.
Carousel posts have edged out short-form videos as the best-performing
format, with 70.3% rating them highly. Professionally, 51% of
respondents feel worse off than last year, and 61% reported budget and
resource changes, with 58% seeing cuts. The biggest challenges social
media professionals face are lack of time, limited creative support,
and leadership that doesn't fully understand social strategy. 

 AI IN CONTENT CREATION 2025 (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Over 80% of creators use AI in their workflows, and 40% rely on it
end-to-end. Video is the top format, with 52.5% of creators focused on
it. Chat tools remain the most used at 37.6%, followed by increasing
use of audio and image tools, especially among educators and L&D
teams. Adoption is highest among L&D (100%), educators (90%), and
agency teams (85%). Younger creators under 25 lag behind, with only
41.8% using AI throughout their process. Most creators use 3 or more
tools, reflecting a shift toward multimodal and stackable AI-powered
workflows.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW KEURIG BREWED A RETURN TO GROWTH (17 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Keurig's GTM strategy originally focused on machine placement to
drive high-frequency pod purchases, but it stalled growth due to
customer backlash due to excessive DRM restrictions. Under the new
CEO, the company shifted from a saturation mindset to segmentation,
targeting new usage occasions and environments such as dorms, offices,
and small households. Strengthening partner incentives and rethinking
pricing also helped rebuild alignment across retail and brand
collaborators. 

 45% RESPONSE RATES: WHAT CLAY KNOWS THAT YOU DON'T (8 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Cold outreach campaigns on Clay are seeing 45% reply rates by
activating messages at the exact moment buyer intent is detected.
Rather than rely on preset segments or scheduled sends, marketers use
orchestration flows that adapt in real time based on behavioral and
contextual signals. This shifts marketing from batch campaigns to
continuous, signal-driven engagement that reaches customers at the
optimal time on their journey. 

 BEYOND THE OBVIOUS: UNLOCKING GROWTH WITH CREATIVE MARKETING
STRATEGIES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sock Candy, a fashion sock brand known for its sheer, artistic
designs, quadrupled monthly revenue from $10,000 to $40,000 through
creative Meta ad testing and weekly optimization. Growth was also
fueled by indirect marketing on Reddit, where organic community
engagement outperformed traditional promotional tactics. Strategic
pivots based on customer behavior and selective platform use helped
define a distinct brand identity focused on self-expression.

 THE LESS PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT AI, THE MORE THEY USE IT (3 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 People with low AI literacy are more likely to adopt AI tools because
they perceive them as magical. In a global survey of 19,504 people,
those with less AI knowledge were 31% more likely to use AI and 29%
more likely to describe it as magical. This sense of awe makes them
prefer AI for tasks like writing or planning. To increase adoption,
companies should highlight the "magic" of AI when targeting
non-technical users, but avoid this approach with more technically
savvy audiences. 

 GENERATIONAL MARKETING: WHY MARKETERS SHOULD NOT DISCOUNT AGE IN
TODAY'S MEDIA LANDSCAPE (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Age remains one of the strongest predictors of media preferences,
shaping how different generations engage with platforms, devices, and
content formats. While digital adoption is widespread, younger
audiences often prioritize short-form, mobile-first experiences,
whereas older generations continue to favor linear content, longer
formats, and familiar platforms. These behavioral differences reflect
deeper contrasts in motivations, such as the desire for discovery
versus comfort, or speed versus depth, making age-informed
segmentation essential for any campaign. 

 HOW THE EAGLES ARE TURNING TUSH PUSH DRAMA INTO A MARKETING
MASTERCLASS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Philadelphia Eagles are capitalizing on the NFL's failure to ban
the "tush push" by turning it into a marketing campaign and fan
rallying point. The team released a $40 "Push On" shirt and launched a
wave of social media content, including a 26-minute video of tush push
plays. A proposal to outlaw the play fell two votes short, with 22 in
favor and 10 against, and only one of the Eagles' 2025 opponents voted
to keep it. Retired center Jason Kelce reportedly helped influence the
vote. The team has embraced the play as a core part of its identity
and branding.
