NEWS & TRENDS

 SMALL SCREENS, BIG RETURNS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Video consumption on small screens, particularly mobile, is
surpassing TV globally. 67% of consumers watch daily on small screens
compared to 50% on big screens. Mobile videos capture more attention,
with 69% of viewers giving them their full focus, compared to 50% for
TV. Advertising across both small and big screens boosts brand
outcomes, especially among Gen Z. Shorter mobile ads are more
impactful. 

 HOW PODCASTS EMERGED AS VEHICLES OF MASS REACH, NICHE AUDIENCES, AND
CULTURAL INFLUENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 With a monthly audience of 135 million, podcasts have established
themselves as a cultural cornerstone. The industry's growth has led
brands to shift ad budgets toward podcasts as they recognize podcasts'
unmatched ability to foster loyalty and community among listeners. The
medium creates highly engaged and niche audiences, offering brands a
new way to create lasting connections and reach customers who may not
be easily targeted via traditional marketing channels.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO USE THE HOOK MODEL TO MAKE YOUR CONTENT IRRESISTIBLE (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The Hook Model guides users through a loop of triggers, actions,
rewards, and investments to form habits. Marketers can apply these
principles to content by creating compelling triggers - notifications,
prompts, or value-driven insights - across multiple channels, making
it easy for users to engage. With each interaction, users build a
stronger attachment to the brand, fostering loyalty and repeated
engagement. 

 GOOGLE CAUTIONS ABOUT USING GOOGLE TRENDS FOR CONTENT IDEAS (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Be careful to not overuse Google Trends for content ideas. Creators
should be selective and focus on their own expertise and user needs.
Content should add unique value rather than repeat what others have
said. Derive ideas from user insights and real business needs instead
of relying heavily on tools to ensure content serves users rather than
search engines.

 CUSTOMER EMPATHY IN SEO IS REQUIRED (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In SEO, customer empathy - not technical skills - is the underrated
key to resonating with users' true intentions. By prioritizing it, SEO
professionals can go beyond keywords to truly resonate with user
needs, building content that feels relevant and trustworthy. This
approach, which focuses on understanding and addressing real user pain
points, provides a lasting advantage over AI's data-based predictions,
enhancing credibility and user connection. 

 AI INFLUENCERS CAN NOW REP YOUR BRAND. SHOULD THEY? (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Using AI influencers can bring creative control and cost efficiency,
but not without challenges. Brands should assess product fit - AI is
better at selling tangible items over experiences. The influencer's
realism, personality, and values must align with the brand while
avoiding the uncanny valley effect, where characters that appear
almost human evoke discomfort or eeriness in consumers. Brands must
also consider potential backlash and upcoming regulations. 

 SPOTIFY WILL START PAYING VIDEO PODCAST HOSTS BASED ON HOW WELL THEIR
VIDEOS PERFORM (2 MINUTE READ) [15]

on video performance. This is to incentivize creators to publish video
components alongside their podcasts. Starting January 2025, premium
subscribers can watch video podcasts ad-free. Spotify, aiming to rival
YouTube, will add features like chapters and personalized
recommendations and allow direct clip uploads for promotion.
