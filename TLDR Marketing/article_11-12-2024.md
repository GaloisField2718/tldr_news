NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE'S YEAR IN SEARCH 2024 (WEBSITE) [5] 

 There has been a strong interest in sports this year, with cricket
dominating general searches. Climate change impacted news trends. The
"Hum to Search" feature gained popularity. Visual and multimodal
searches, which combine text and images, were frequently used for
translation, shopping, and object identification. 

 SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCER IS A GROWING CAREER CHOICE. COLLEGES HAVE
NOTICED (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Universities are increasingly offering programs to train the next
generation of social media influencers. These programs focus on skills
like storytelling, film production, and understanding business
contracts. Schools such as the University of Alabama and Arkansas Tech
University are leading the way. However, there's debate about whether
formal education in this volatile industry is necessary.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE MINORITY UNDERDOG EFFECT (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Customers are more forgiving of service or product failures, are
willing to pay more, and are willing to give higher ratings when a
business is minority-owned. Experiments showed that college students
were 18.8% more likely to pay more for a faulty product from a
Black-owned business. Minority-owned brands received 19.8% to 35.8%
higher ratings than non-minority brands for similar failings. Google
Maps data reveals that customers used more positive tones in 34.1% of
4-5 star reviews for Black-owned restaurants. Highlighting minority
ownership is most effective when integrated authentically into brand
marketing. 

 WHAT I PLAN TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON NEXT YEAR (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Head of Growth at Default plans to focus on influencers, creative
campaigns, and premium content instead of heavy ad spending.
Influencer programs will carefully select creators to drive pipeline
growth, while creative "drops," like branded giveaways and
experiential marketing, aim to engage prospects. High-quality content
remains a top priority, serving as the foundation for all marketing
efforts.

premium versions of Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, and Grok. He relies on
Claude for financial, health, and writing advice, while Gemini
integrates with Google tools for daily productivity. ChatGPT serves as
his search engine and research tool, complementing Claude. Grok
provides real-time updates for his podcast prep and trend tracking. 

 INSTAGRAM LAUNCHES TRIAL REELS FOR AUDIENCE SAMPLING (3 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Instagram's new Trial Reels feature lets creators test content with a
small audience of non-followers to assess performance before full
publication. Metrics like comments and likes help evaluate success,
with an option to expand reach if the Reel performs well. The feature
is currently rolling out to select users worldwide.

 THE PITFALLS OF NICKNAME BRANDING (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Using nicknames in branding reduces consumer engagement and
perceptions of brand power. Ads using nicknames showed 42% lower
click-through rates. Tweets with formal names received over twice as
many likes and retweets as those with nicknames. Nickname branding
decreased purchase intent for competent brands, like Starbucks, by up
to 16%, but had little impact on warm or social-good-focused brands.
While consumer use of nicknames can benefit brands, adopting them in
marketing signals disempowerment and weakens brand image. 

 GIGAPAY: PAYMENT DELAYS HAMPER INFLUENCER MARKETING GROWTH (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Performance-based compensation now accounts for 49.6% of influencer
payments, reflecting a shift from traditional flat-rate payments,
which make up 24.1%. Payment delays, often up to 30 days for
international creators, and complex tax compliance are major barriers
to this model's growth. Currency conversion fees and fluctuating
exchange rates further reduce earnings for creators. Delayed payments,
which can stretch to 120 days for major brand partnerships, are
driving creators away from certain platforms. 

 PRODUCT LAUNCH STRATEGY GUIDE (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Nearly all failed product launches share common issues: overemphasis
on features, lack of emotional appeal, and poor differentiation.
Winning strategies prioritize understanding consumer lives and their
pain points, crafting relatable narratives, and mitigating perceived
risks through assurances. Differentiation and emotional resonance
drive engagement and ensure a product's long-term success.
