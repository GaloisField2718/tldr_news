NEWS & TRENDS

 WHY ADVERTISERS CAN'T OVERLOOK THE BUYING POWER OF VETERANS (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Veterans are a high-income, tech-enabled audience with large
purchasing power across home improvement, electronics, and digital
shopping. With an average household income of $115K and above-average
engagement with live and cable TV, they represent a premium consumer
segment. Their strong presence in small business ownership and
work-from-home roles creates further relevance for categories like
office tech, software, and pet care. 

 WHY DO THE YOUNG TRUST BRANDS MORE THAN THE OLD? (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Research shows that younger people report trusting brands more than
older people. The difference reflects how each group defines trust.
Over-35s tend to trust charities, financial services, and healthcare
providers, valuing ethics and safety. Meanwhile, under-35s trust
everyday retailers and online services for reliability and
performance. For older consumers, trust is a filter that must be
earned through values and customer care. For younger consumers, trust
is a baseline, and marketing should demonstrate consistent service and
reliability.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MORNING BREW'S GROWTH STRATEGY: HOW A NEWSLETTER BUILT A $75M MEDIA
EMPIRE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Morning Brew turned business news into a media empire by combining an
accessible voice, a viral referral program, and effective native
advertising. Its newsletter, launched by two University of Michigan
students in 2015, now reaches over 4M subscribers and drives 30% of
new signups through referrals at almost no cost. The brand's
conversational writing style and humor make complex topics easy to
understand. Its multi-platform ecosystem across newsletters, podcasts,
and social media built an audience and revenue model that has become a
blueprint for modern media growth. 

 HOW THIS CEO TURNED 25,000 HOURS OF SALES CALLS INTO A SELF-LEARNING
GTM ENGINE (43 MINUTE PODCAST) [9] 

 Matt Britton, CEO of Suzy, built a GTM system from 25,000 hours of
customer calls. Using Zapier and Gong, he created automated workflows
that generate summaries, sentiment scores, sales coaching, and keyword
extraction from transcripts. The framework fuels paid media and SEO
efforts without manual input. It also produces privacy-compliant
content and live Slack alerts. His approach redefines the executive
role in AI implementation by replacing delegation with direct
capability building.

 WHAT WE LEARNED FROM 180 TOP-RANKED GOOGLE ADS (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 High-ranking Google Ads use urgency and power words like “today”,
“now”, “free”, and “get” to grab attention. Numbers and
superlatives such as “top” boost credibility and specificity,
while adjectives like “luxury” and “expert” emphasize quality
over price. Clear calls to action, most often phone calls, guide users
toward immediate next steps. Headlines favor professional punctuation
and title case, while dynamic keyword insertion is rarely used. 

 WHAT TRIGGERS AI OVERVIEWS? 86 FACTORS AND 146 MILLION SERPS ANALYZED
(7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI Overviews appear on 21% of all keywords, showing that Google
surfaces them most often for informational, question-based, and longer
queries. 99.9% of AIOs appear on informational searches, 57.9% on
question queries, and 46% on queries with seven or more words. AIOs
are 1.9x more common for non-branded searches and frequently appear in
categories like Science (43.6%) and Health (43%), while being rare in
Shopping (3.2%) and News (15.1%).

 HOW THE BEST PRODUCTS REMOVE GUILT (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Grüns grew fast by turning a chore into a treat. Founder Chad Janis
saw that people liked supplements but hated messy powders. He made
vitamins into gummies instead. The idea worked because it flipped
guilt into permission. Eating candy became taking vitamins. Grüns
showed that good products make people feel good about what they
already want to do. The same rule applies to AI and other tools. Turn
hard or guilty tasks into things people enjoy. 

 HOW DO YOU MEASURE THE ROI OF TIMELESSNESS? (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Timelessness is a brand's ability to stay relevant as trends change.
It signals consistency and endurance seen in brands like Apple and
Chanel. Timeless brands grow through trust, design, consistency, and
resilience. Trust builds loyalty and profit, while design creates
recognition and emotional connection. Consistency drives efficiency,
and resilience protects pricing and market share. Measuring
timelessness means tracking retention and execution efficiency. The
payoff comes from patience and disciplined brand building that
compounds over time.
