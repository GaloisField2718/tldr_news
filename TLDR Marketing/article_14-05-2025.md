NEWS & TRENDS

 FREE TV IS BOOMING (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Viewership of major ‘free ad-supported television' (FAST) services
like Tubi and Pluto TV rose by 21% and 15%, respectively, over the
past year, according to Nielsen. Additional data also shows a surge to
1,755 FAST channels across major markets like the US, UK, Canada, and
Germany, a 67% growth compared to mid-2023. Free TV is successfully
positioning itself as the scalable, low-barrier alternative to a
saturated subscription environment. 

 GENERATIONAL GAPS TO POSE CHALLENGES FOR BRANDS WITH
ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL APPROACH (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Generational differences in content preferences, buying behavior, and
customer service expectations are widening and making
one-size-fits-all strategies ineffective. For instance, 84% of Baby
Boomers prefer informative content, while only 56% of Gen Z feel the
same. Gen Z is more drawn to interactivity, with 46% saying it makes
brand videos appealing. Service preferences vary as well, with over
half of Boomers still favoring phone calls while younger generations
prefer social DMs. Without a generationally aware strategy, brands
risk missing key opportunities for engagement.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE B.R.E.W. FRAMEWORK: HOW WE DECIDE WHICH MARKETING IDEAS TO PURSUE
(6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ahrefs uses the B.R.E.W. framework to evaluate marketing ideas across
Business potential, Reach, Effort, and Who (right people for the
task). The system replaces instinctive decision-making with a
consistent scoring method, helping teams prioritize everything from
viral content ideas to high-cost initiatives like conferences. By
revisiting and re-scoring ideas as team bandwidth and technology
evolve, the framework ensures resources are directed toward
initiatives that align with strategic goals and current capabilities. 

 A FRAMEWORK FOR DEFINING AND REFINING YOUR ICP (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To define and refine your ICP, use a detailed framework that
pinpoints which companies benefit most from your product. Avoid vague
descriptions such as “mid-sized companies” or “enterprises”. A
strong ICP includes clear firmographics, specific buyer behaviors, and
well-defined problem statements. The Five Question Framework helps
uncover these insights by prompting you to reflect on patterns across
your best customers, common objections in lost deals, upsell
opportunities, and what competitor customers have in common. This
approach gives you the clarity needed to target the right prospects.

 BUFFER'S TRANSPARENCY FLYWHEEL (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Buffer used a 2013 security breach to prove its commitment to
transparency by publicly sharing detailed updates within 24 hours,
including CEO responses and real-time progress. Instead of losing
trust, it gained praise and reinforced customer loyalty. Buffer then
made transparency a permanent practice by publishing employee
salaries, financials, and internal documents, leading to a 230% spike
in job applications and improved retention. Its long-term openness
created a trust flywheel that gave it flexibility in decision-making
and a competitive edge that others couldn't easily copy. 

 PRESSURE TO TIP STOPS PEOPLE FROM RETURNING (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Customers are significantly less likely to return or recommend a
business if they feel observed while tipping. A study of 36,888
transactions showed that a lack of tipping privacy reduced revisit
likelihood by 24.7% and referral intent by up to 40% on digital
platforms. Being watched while tipping does not increase tip amounts
but instead creates negative feelings that drive people away.
Businesses should ensure tipping privacy to protect customer
satisfaction and loyalty, even in digital settings.
