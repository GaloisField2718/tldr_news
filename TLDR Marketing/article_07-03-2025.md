NEWS & TRENDS

 ‘TARIFFIC' DEALS, CAPACITY CUTS, MARKETING PAUSES: CANADIAN
AIRLINES REACT TO U.S. TRADE WAR (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Canadian airlines are adjusting their marketing in response to U.S.
tariffs. Porter Airlines paused U.S.-focused advertising after
consumers called it “tone-deaf” but is keeping fares low to
maintain demand. Flair Airlines used the tariffs as a marketing
opportunity, launching a “Tariffic Flight Deals” sale with 25% off
non-U.S. routes. Meanwhile, Air Canada is shifting focus away from
certain U.S. leisure markets. 

 54% OF AMERICANS ARE CREEPED OUT BY PERSONALIZED ADVERTISING (2
MINUTE READ) [5]

saying targeted ads make them uneasy. The discomfort rises with age,
peaking at 62% among Gen X and Boomers, and 59% cite browsing
history-based ads as the most intrusive. 52% say opt-out options would
make them feel less concerned and 44% have already turned to ad
blockers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO WRITE AN INFLUENCER BRIEF (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hinge finds and selects influencers through social listening,
internal recommendations, and creator referrals to build a curated
partnership network. The brand adopts an open-ended briefing process,
giving influencers clear guidelines while allowing creative freedom to
enhance authenticity. Success is measured beyond cost-per-metric
performance, with a focus on audience demographics, engagement
quality, and comment sentiment to drive long-term brand impact. 

 PSA: IMAGE-HEAVY EMAILS STILL HURT DELIVERABILITY (2 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Avoid all-image emails since inbox providers like Gmail and Yahoo
analyze text content. Image-heavy emails break on slow connections,
limit accessibility, and make content unsearchable. Follow a 40%
text/60% image rule by using real HTML text, web-safe fonts, and HTML
buttons instead of image-based CTAs. Improve segmentation instead of
relying on broad "90-day engaged" lists. Instead of copying Figma
designs as full images, convert what you can into HTML and test the
impact.

 HOW TO HIRE A GREAT MARKETING TEAM (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Marketing teams should be built based on a company's market,
audience, and stage, making hiring a complex, ongoing process.
Structuring a team involves three main functions: content & brand
("Fuel"), growth & demand generation ("Engine"), and product marketing
("Foundation"), with pi-shaped marketers—those with expertise in two
areas—being ideal hires in early stages. Hiring frameworks like AORs
(Areas of Responsibility), scorecards, and structured assignments
improve team organization, hiring effectiveness, and clarity for the
rest of the company. Interview processes should assess adaptability,
problem-solving, and strategic thinking, with a mix of live and
written assignments to ensure candidates can execute real-world tasks.

 HOW VANTA BUILT A $128K/MONTH SEO MOAT (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Over 60% of Vanta's top-ranking keywords come from its Collection
subfolders, a strategy that drives 13.9K monthly visits. By
structuring compliance content into subfolder clusters, Vanta builds
topical authority while funneling users toward high-intent pages. Its
systematic use of internal linking, keyword saturation, and structured
navigation strengthens its SEO moat, making it difficult for
competitors to simply copy. 

 TINY OFFERS: HOW LOW-TICKET OFFERS CAN ACCELERATE YOUR GROWTH (7
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Tiny offers are low-ticket digital products priced between $7 and
$47. They convert passive leads into paying customers by solving a
specific selection problem upfront. Unlike free content that often
attracts disengaged subscribers, these offers create immediate value,
accelerating trust and positioning buyers for higher-ticket purchases.
A well-structured tiny offer funnel, including order bumps and
upsells, covers acquisition costs while generating profit, making it a
sustainable strategy for growth, especially for smaller companies. 

 9 PSYCHOLOGY CONCEPTS FOR BETTER MARKETING (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Effective marketing is based on understanding psychological triggers
that influence buying decisions. The IHE method—Interviews,
Hypotheses, and Experiments—helps identify and validate these
triggers systematically. Key psychological principles like the Halo
Effect, Loss Aversion, Social Proof, and Scarcity Effect can
significantly impact conversion rates. Implementing strategies like
showcasing testimonials, emphasizing the risks of inaction, and
leveraging authority bias can build trust and drive sales. Applying
psychology strategically removes guesswork and makes marketing more
effective.
