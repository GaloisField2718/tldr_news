 TRY THIS "SECRET" DISCOUNT PAGE HACK (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Customers often search for ‚Äú[Company] coupon code‚Äù only to find

conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

 To find suitable journalists for your story, start with media
databases like Cision or MuckRack to identify potential contacts. Use

Leverage X and LinkedIn to confirm contact details. Check the target
publication's contact or staff directory pages to find relevant
journalists and verify they haven't covered your topic already. Review
journalist bios and recent articles to confirm their beat and
interest. Personalize your pitch to align with each journalist's focus
and avoid mass emailing.
