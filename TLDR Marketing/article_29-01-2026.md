NEWS & TRENDS

 OPENAI SETS EARLY CHATGPT AD PRICING AT ABOUT $60 CPM (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 ChatGPT ad pricing is starting almost 3X higher than typical Meta
rates and closer to premium TV or live sports inventory. Advertisers
will only get basic metrics like impressions and clicks, with no
conversion or attribution data. Early campaigns will be more about
reach than performance. OpenAI is rolling out ads in the coming weeks
on the free and Go tiers, targeting large brands through agencies. 

 GOOGLE EXPLORING WAYS TO ALLOW SITES TO OPT OUT OF AI OVERVIEWS & AI
MODE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google is exploring new controls that would let websites opt out of
having their content used in Search AI features like AI Overviews and
AI Mode due to new UK Competition and Markets Authority requirements.
It said the controls would give sites more choice while avoiding
changes that could break Search or create a confusing experience for
users. The CMA proposal would require it to give publishers
transparency and opt-out options for AI Overviews and for AI training
outside of Search, along with clearer attribution in AI results. The
proposal would also require fair and transparent ranking practices,
mandatory choice screens on Android and Chrome, and improved data
portability for users and businesses.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 REPLYING TO YOUR INSTAGRAM COMMENTS CAN BOOST ENGAGEMENT BY 21% (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A large-scale analysis across nearly 68,000 accounts found that
creator replies correlate with a 21% engagement increase relative to
typical performance. The lift appears across different content types
and is reinforced by multiple analytical methods, including
fixed-effects modeling and Z-score comparisons. Instagram's algorithms
reward sustained interaction and repeated account-to-account
engagement. Replying early and consistently keeps posts active longer
and increases the likelihood of follow-on engagement. 

 THERE ARE 3 KINDS OF “GOING VIRAL”, BUT ONLY 1 HELPS YOUR
BUSINESS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most viral content falls into empathy or debate, creating visibility
without durable value or consistent conversion. The most profitable
form is resource virality, where posts deliver tactical utility that
audiences actively save and reuse. These posts grow more slowly but
establish authority and long-term distribution. Success depends on
clarity and designing content explicitly for future reference or
shares.

 HOW AI IS CHANGING MARKETING ATTRIBUTION (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI is changing marketing attribution by reconstructing full deal
stories from structured and unstructured data instead of relying on
simplified touch models. Traditional attribution fails because data is
incomplete and noisy. Adverity found 45% of marketing data is
unreliable, while 43% of CMOs trust less than half of it. AI can
capture buyer context from calls and emails, analyze sequences at
scale, and reveal hidden drivers such as referrals that accounted for
a third of revenue in one case or motions that converted at 2x the
rate of cold outbound. This approach depends on strong data quality,
and it can reduce reporting time to minutes while uncovering gains
like a 5% pipeline lift from events that older models missed. 

 A REFLECTION ON SEO & AI SEARCH IN 2025 (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Most GEO tactics recycled core SEO, while risky shortcuts threatened
long-term visibility. AI search cut clicks but increased upstream
influence, pushing marketers to track brand presence, not traffic.
Traditional SEO still powers AI answers through indexing and ranking.
The real shift is toward brand mentions, multimodal content, and
off-site credibility. AEO expands SEO, not replaces it, and Google
remains the main source of website traffic. 

 GOOGLE BEGINS ROLLING OUT CHROME'S “AUTO BROWSE” AI AGENT (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Chrome now includes an autonomous browsing agent that can complete
multi-step web tasks like research and comparison shopping inside the
browser. The agent runs in the background, opens and manages tabs on
its own, and checks in only when user input or approval is required.
It integrates tightly with Google services such as Gmail, Calendar,
Maps, Shopping, and Flights, expanding what AI can execute without
manual navigation.
