 HOW TO DESIGN A WORLD-CLASS LANDING PAGE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Landing Page Content Triangle describes the structure that your
landing page should follow. Landing pages should answer ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù
and ‚Äúwho?‚Äù above the fold and ‚Äúhow?‚Äù below the fold. The top
of the page must be extremely succinct and be limited to a headline,
subheadline, and social proof. Below the fold gives you room to make
your offering shine by showcasing your value propositions and use
cases. Crucially, the writing must be clear and align with messaging
on the growth mediums that lead to the page. Analytics, heatmapping,
and A/B testing tools can also help optimize landing page performance
