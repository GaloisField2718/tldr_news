NEWS & TRENDS

 CHATGPT IS SENDING LESS TRAFFIC TO WEBSITES, DOWN 52% IN A MONTH (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Referral traffic from ChatGPT to websites has dropped steeply, with
much of the citation share shifting towards Wikipedia and Reddit. Data
from Profound shows that these answer-first platforms are now
dominating ChatGPT citations, while branded websites that focus on
conversions are losing visibility. The shift appears to be the result
of OpenAI manually reweighting its retrieval system to prioritize
direct, user-focused answers. 

 FROM ‘HI [NAME]' TO AI: HAS TARGETING CROSSED THE LINE? (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Data remains the most valuable resource for platforms and
advertisers, and AI is accelerating its application in more
sophisticated ways. What began with basic personalization has now
expanded into intelligence-grade analytics, where the line between
consumer marketing and surveillance becomes increasingly blurred.
Companies exploring these strategies must weigh competitive advantage
against ethical responsibilities and consumer trust, as the long-term
viability of data-driven marketing depends on finding the balance.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WIN REPORT: HOW TRUST SIGNALS TURNED SUSPICION INTO 16% MORE SIGNUPS
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Party Hard Travel increased signups by 16% after addressing customer
fears about scams and payment timing. Research showed that 11% of
non-converting visitors cited scams as their top concern, while
another 11% cited cost, which was more about coordinating group
payments than affordability. To reduce these objections, the company
added a benefits bar to its homepage that highlighted 40,000 annual
bookings, a £30 deposit option, and a 4.8-star Trustpilot rating. The
change reassured customers about legitimacy and flexibility, which led
to more conversions. 

 5 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BUILDING A REDDIT STRATEGY (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Create or co-manage a brand subreddit to control your presence, and
identify 3-5 relevant subreddits by researching priority keywords.
Engage authentically for the first few weeks, following the 80/20 rule
for brand mentions. Build relationships with active members and
participate daily, aiming to comment early in new threads. This will
help increase trust and visibility in search and AI results.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

list labeled by subject line. The full prompt is included in the post.

 CEO GPT (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A CEO GPT can capture a CEO's voice, style, and key phrases to
simplify communications. Teams can feed it transcripts from podcasts,
YouTube videos, and social posts, along with internal briefing
materials. It can quickly generate authentic quotes, press briefings,
and other content without hours of manual work. The tool can be
updated over time to reflect evolving messaging. 

 IS LINK BUILDING DEAD? (15 DATA STUDIES BEHIND THE CLICKBAIT) (9
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Backlinks and referring domains still correlate strongly with higher
Google rankings, with the top-ranking page having 3.8 times more
backlinks than results in positions 2 to 10. Traditional link-building
methods, such as guest posting and link insertions, have declined in
value, as only 4.6% of sites offering such services were found to be
high quality. Digital PR has become the most effective strategy,
earning authoritative links and unlinked mentions that strengthen
brand authority and visibility. AI Overviews cite top-ranking pages in
over 90% of cases, but unlinked mentions are often more impactful than
backlink volume for AI visibility. Link building is not dead, but it
has shifted toward authority-focused digital PR and brand strategies
rather than raw link quantity.
