NEWS & TRENDS

 IT'S NOT YOUR IMAGINATION. ADVERTISING IS GETTING WORSE – AND IT
MIGHT BE DELIBERATE (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Copywriting in advertising is deteriorating as brands pursue slogans
that generate conversation even if they confuse or alienate audiences.
The shift away from persuasive writing toward rapid content production
is driven by AI adoption, the collapse of traditional copywriting, and
a perception that consumers no longer engage with longer form
messaging. As agencies chase virality over clarity, the loss of
focused craft has led to campaigns that shout rather than persuade,
replacing brand narratives with surface-level disruption. 

 GOOGLE AI MODE TRAFFIC IS UNTRACKABLE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's AI Mode in Search hides referral data, making traffic from
it invisible in Google Search Console and analytics tools, where it's
instead classified as Direct or Unknown. This lack of transparency
prevents website owners from knowing how much traffic AI Mode is
driving, despite claims that it delivers higher-quality visits. The
links generated include a “noreferrer” attribute, which strips
referrer information and blocks attribution. While Google states AI
features are included in overall search traffic, current documentation
only references AI Overviews, not AI Mode, leaving significant gaps in
reporting and visibility.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TURN YOUR POWER USERS INTO CREATORS AND VICE VERSA (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Brands can turn customers into thriving communities by prioritizing
YouTube as a central content engine, repurposing videos across
platforms, and deeply engaging in the comments. Transform power users
into creators (and vice versa), using them not just for content but as
credible advocates who resonate more authentically than branded
messaging. Build advisory boards from engaged users to gather product
feedback, test content, and foster loyalty. Make users feel heard,
empowered, and involved at every stage. 

 WHY GOING VIRAL IS NOT A VIABLE MARKETING STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Video is a powerful format for storytelling, but it only works when
the story, audience, and business goals are well-defined before
production begins. Many companies fall into the trap of producing
content for volume or entertainment value, assuming visibility will
translate to impact, but attention without intent rarely drives
growth. Build strategic video systems that scale with the brand,
resonate with the audience, and deliver insights that guide future
efforts.
