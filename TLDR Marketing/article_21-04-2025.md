NEWS & TRENDS

 FRAGMENTED SEARCH ENSURES THE FUTURE OF SEO (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 SEO has long been synonymous with Google, but the rise of AI-powered
platforms and search interfaces is shifting that reality. New entry
points like voice assistants, smart glasses, visual search, and
connected cars are fragmenting how consumers find information,
requiring businesses to rethink discoverability beyond Google's
algorithm. In this context, SEO becomes a cross-functional strategy to
unify content, data, and structure across channels, turning fragmented
search into a growth opportunity instead of an operational burden. 

 YOUTUBE: CULTURE & TRENDS REPORT VIRTUAL CREATORS (7 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Virtual creators are now a defining force in digital culture,
changing how audiences engage with online content. In 2024, 57% of
people aged 14-44 watched content from a virtual creator. In one year,
a sample of just 300 virtual creators generated over 15B views on
YouTube, including 1 billion from the US. Over the past three years,
VTuber-related videos have averaged 50B views annually. Hatsune Miku
alone reached a record 5.5B views in 2024.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE "$0 WITH A TWIST" STRATEGY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Domino's offered free pizza for life to anyone who tattooed its logo,
expecting only a few responses. Over 350 people participated within
five days, prompting an early shutdown. The stunt reflects a "$0 with
a Twist" strategy, where brands give something away in exchange for a
strange but achievable challenge. Similar tactics by Krispy Kreme,
Vitaminwater, and HBO have driven viral buzz and high engagement.
These campaigns succeed because people value rewards they earn and
enjoy sharing unique experiences, which fuels free publicity. 

 GTM CAMPAIGN SYSTEMS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This campaign system shows how to build an audience, generate signals
for sales actions, and run coordinated plays. It connects content,
outbound, and sales into one repeatable engine. It's built with a
clear objective, aligned messaging, and shared execution. It's not
about making slides, it's about making progress. If your marketing
plan isn't tied to sales and lacks coordination, it will fall flat.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 CHATGPT WILL NOW USE ITS ‘MEMORY' TO PERSONALIZE WEB SEARCHES (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ChatGPT's new “Memory with Search” feature uses user-specific
data from past chats to refine web search queries. The feature
rewrites prompts using past conversation data, such as turning
“restaurants near me” into “vegan restaurants in San
Francisco”. The feature, which gives OpenAI an edge over rival AI
platforms, is rolling out gradually and can be disabled via settings. 

 HELP A REPORTER OUT (HARO) IS BACK! (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 HARO is relaunching on April 22 as an email-based service under new
leadership from Brett Farmiloe, CEO of Featured.com. It will
differentiate itself from other digital PR tools through brand
recognition and its role in directly connecting journalists with real
experts via email. The platform will implement strict verification
tools like AI text detection, LinkedIn validation, and community
reporting to combat spam, fake personas, and AI-generated content.
Anyone found misusing the platform will face a lifetime ban. HARO,
though primarily US-based, has a strong presence in the UK and
Australia and plans to maintain a global reach.

 DEVELOPER MARKETING IN 2025: WHAT WORKS, WHAT'S CHANGING, AND HOW TO
WIN (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Developer marketing is evolving as AI and low-code tools expand the
definition of "developer." Success still relies on an intuitive
product experience, fast onboarding, and continuous improvements.
Developers prefer hands-on trials, technical documentation, and real
code over traditional marketing, making Product-Led Growth the top
strategy. Loyalty comes from power users, community engagement, and
charismatic, socially active CEOs like Sam Altman. Humor and
personalized touches also build long-term advocacy. 

 THE ROAS ILLUSION: RETHINKING WHAT GOOGLE ADS SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE (6
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A skincare brand reporting 600% ROAS may still be unprofitable if its
best-selling product only has a 10% margin, once costs like shipping,
returns, and marketing are factored in. ROAS favors short-term tactics
like branded search and retargeting, which often capture conversions
that would have happened anyway. The article proposes profit per
impression (PPI) for top-of-funnel measurement, customer lifetime
value (CLV) to optimize for high-retention users, and incrementality
testing to isolate true ad-driven lift. 

 INFLUENCERS FUELLING MISOGYNY IN SCHOOLS, TEACHERS SAY (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Nearly 60% of UK teachers say social media harms student behavior,
with influencers like Andrew Tate linked to rising misogyny and sexism
in schools. Some teachers report boys refusing to interact with female
staff or praising Tate's views in class assignments. A separate BBC
survey found over one-third of secondary teachers saw misogynistic
behavior in the past week, and 40% felt unprepared to address it.
Experts warn that widespread access to pornography is amplifying these
issues by reinforcing power imbalances boys see echoed in online
content.
