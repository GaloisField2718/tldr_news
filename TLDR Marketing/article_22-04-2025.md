 NETFLIX IS EYEING VIDEO PODCASTS AS IT EXPANDS BEYOND TV AND FILM (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Netflix is expanding into video podcasts as it diversifies beyond TV
and film. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos noted that video podcasts could soon
appear on the platform as the lines between talk shows and podcasts
blur. With YouTube leading podcast viewing, Netflix plans to attract
creators by offering a premium monetization model and helping them
reach a larger audience. 

 THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF A POTENTIAL GOOGLE AD TECH BREAKUP (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's ad tech monopoly has been ruled anticompetitive. This
prompts potential changes that could benefit publishers, SSPs, and
advertisers. Remedies might involve separating Google's ad server and
SSP, increasing auction transparency, and fostering competition. While
publishers could face higher costs or loss of free tools, the
disruption could lead to better control and monetization. However,
changes will take time, as appeals are likely. The industry's future
hinges on regulatory follow-through to ensure fairness and
transparency in ad tech.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO ADVERTISE TO DISTRACTED CONSUMERS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In lifelike, multi-tasking environments, distracted consumers
actually recalled pop-up ads better. This contradicts the traditional
Dual-Task Interference theory. Ad recall was 11.4% higher when all
content appeared on a single screen and 29.9% higher when ads were
thematically aligned with the main content. Timing also mattered - ads
placed during less engaging moments saw a 12.9-16.2% boost in recall.
Repeated exposure further increased effectiveness, suggesting that
automaticity enables ads to benefit from distraction rather than
suffer from it. 

 IN INFLUENCER MARKETING, PRECISION WINS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Precision influencer campaigns are 6X more efficient at reaching
target consumers. Brands should identify emotionally connected
consumer “tribes,” use social listening to tailor messaging, and
prioritize influencer credibility over follower count. With 40% of
skincare purchases influenced by social media, emotionally driven
sectors see the biggest returns. Winning brands pair local execution
with central support, structured training, and clear KPIs to scale
growth.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 GAMMA (TOOL) [8] 

 Gamma creates presentations, websites, documents, and social media
content without design expertise. By inputting a prompt, pasting text,
or uploading files, users can generate brand-aligned content using
over 20 AI models. Features include smart layouts, real-time
collaboration, and export options to formats such as PPT, PDF, and
Google Slides. 

 INSTAGRAM WILL USE AI TO IDENTIFY TEENS USING ADULT ACCOUNTS (1
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Instagram is using AI to identify underage users who lied about their
birth date and move them into teen accounts with stricter safety
features. It recently restricted live streaming for users under 16 and
now requires parental consent to turn off filters that blur nude
images in DMs. At least 54M teens are enrolled in teen accounts, and
most users aged 13-15 keep that setting. Meta faces lawsuits,
including from California, for allegedly failing to protect minors on
its platforms.

 THE GO-TO MINDSET: 15 BELIEFS THAT POWER GREAT GTM TEAMS (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This article reframes GTM success as a function of belief systems
rather than checklists. It shares 15 beliefs that drive effective
execution, advocating for clarity, specificity, and internal
alignment. By rejecting hustle culture, embracing first principles,
and shifting from reactive to resilient leadership, teams foster
boldness, ownership, and simplicity. This reduces friction,
strengthens cultural cohesion, and drives measurable progress aligned
with business strategy. 

 WHY MINDSET, NOT JUST TECH, DEFINES AI SUCCESS IN MARKETING (7 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 AI success in marketing relies on a shift in mindset, not just
technology. Marketers must move from traditional "linear"
organizations to "hyperadaptive" ones, where decision-making is fast,
collaborative, and driven by real-time insights. Instead of just
optimizing existing processes, AI should be used to reinvent them.
