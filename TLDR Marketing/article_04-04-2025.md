NEWS & TRENDS

 THE SPARK OF DISCOVERY: REIGNITING THE EMOTION OF ECOMMERCE (6 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 New research from Criteo and Vitreous World finds that online
shopping feels lonely to 79% of consumers and overwhelms 78% due to
too many choices. Only 50% find it relaxing or enjoyable, and 29%
consider it a chore. While 55% of brands believe influencers help,
just 29% of shoppers feel positively about influencer content. 83% of
brands plan to use AI to improve the experience, aiming to restore the
lost sense of surprise and delight. These findings are based on a
global survey of 6,000 consumers and 600 brand leaders across six
markets: the UK, US, France, Germany, Japan, and South Korea. 

 SOCIAL MEDIA DETOXES KILL AD ATTENTION (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Users returning from social media detoxes pay less attention to ads,
prioritizing native content. Time-restricted users felt ads wasted
their limited time, but eye-tracking showed only abstinence affected
attention. Viewing times on Instagram dropped significantly
post-detox. Researchers suggest avoiding ads for returning users or
minimizing content complexity. Ads requiring engagement should target
users with recent social media activity. 

 AGENTIC AI: IF EVERYONE HAS A DIGITAL PA, WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE
MARKETERS? (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 We are now in an era of bot-to-bot interactions. Consumers no longer
browse because their AI agents do it for them. These agents make
purchasing decisions based on structured data, trust signals, and
real-time relevance. Ad targeting and SEO are losing ground as AI
agents summarize and act instantly. Marketers must optimize for
machine-readability, design immersive brand experiences, and automate
workflows to stay competitive. This shift is not just a tech
challenge, it is a leadership challenge that requires brands to adapt
or risk being left behind.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW BREX BUILT A $280K SEO MOAT IN JUST 8 MONTHS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The success behind Brex's SEO strategy comes from three main levers:
operational discipline in content structuring, deep understanding of
user intent, and integration of SEO within product marketing. Content
was organized by solution area, such as expense management or credit,
allowing for internal linking and seamless navigation. By aligning
content topics with late-stage buying signals, Brex ensured traffic
came from users close to conversion. This strategy proves that SEO can
be a revenue generating channel and not only a top-of-funnel awareness
driver. 

 HOW BRANDS USE PROFILE PIC JACKING FOR VIRAL GROWTH (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Profile pic jacking, a low-cost marketing tactic, is when users
voluntarily change their social media profile pictures to
brand-related images, creating organic exposure. It works because
profile pictures are highly visible and persistent across platforms,
often staying up for weeks. The strategy leverages psychological
drivers like FOMO and social validation, which help campaigns spread
virally. Brands like Apple, Snapchat, and Notion have used it
successfully to increase visibility and brand recall without paid ads.


 WRITE SMARTER, NOT HARDER: HOW TO USE AI WITHOUT LOSING YOUR SOUL (14
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI works best when trained on your own content. Marketers are
reverse-engineering their favorite posts into prompts and templates to
expedite creation. By pairing informal voice recordings with
structured AI prompts, they are able to accelerate content output
without sacrificing originality and their personal touches. Setting
clear guardrails like formatting rules, tone examples, and business
context also help to prevent AI from becoming a generic content
generator.

 HOW TO CREATE A SHORT-FORM VIDEO SERIES (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A consistent short-form video series can outperform one-off posts by
building habits, viewer loyalty, and monetizable engagement. Success
of the series depends on five key pillars: committing to a focused
publishing window, developing a simple and repeatable format, creating
viewing rituals through consistent release times, using efficient
production workflows, and adapting based on audience feedback. 

 YOUTUBE SHORTS TAKES ON TIKTOK WITH NEW CREATION TOOLS (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 YouTube Shorts is adding new features like an improved video editor,
AI-generated stickers, music sync tools, and enhanced templates. The
editor will let users adjust clip timing, add music or text, and
preview their video more easily. These updates come just before the
April 5 TikTok ban deadline, suggesting YouTube aims to attract
creators who may lose access to TikTok. The tools mirror popular
TikTok and CapCut features, as YouTube moves to stay competitive.

 WHY AI WILL LEAD TO MORE “PROOF OF REALITY” POSTS (6 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 The rise of AI in brand content is triggering a parallel trend:
visual proof that the creative was made by real people. From Apple
TV's behind-the-scenes shots to Topicals tagging every collaborator,
brands are using these signals to preserve trust and highlight craft.
As AI becomes a creative collaborator behind the scenes, consumers are
more likely to reward the brands that show, and not just tell, how
their content comes to life. 

 SNEAKER, CLOTHING MAKERS SINK ON TARIFFS LEAVING NOWHERE TO HIDE (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Trump's new tariffs on Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand are
hitting apparel brands like Nike, Adidas, and Lululemon, forcing price
hikes and stock declines. A 46% tariff on Vietnam is especially
damaging, with few mitigation options. Analysts warn of inflation and
recession risks. The tariffs also triggered a bond selloff. Vietnam
seeks to ease tensions by boosting US purchases amid its large trade
surplus.
