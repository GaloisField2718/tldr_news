 SCISSORS-ROCK-PAPER: HOW TO TURN YOUR COMPANY'S SIZE INTO A
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Scissors-Rock-Paper is a metaphor that explains the challenges and
opportunities that come from being a small (scissors), medium (rock),
or large (paper) company. Young/small companies must focus ‚Äî like a
sharp pair of scissors ‚Äî which helps them get market share from big
but unfocused papers. Medium-sized companies add new products and/or
sub-brands, so they lose some focus but can still crush scissors with
their momentum. Large companies have more product lines, which allows
them to cover rocks with their resources, but still lose to
hyper-focused scissors. Young brands should lean into being
hyper-focused rather than simply copying the big players in their
industry. Companies should also be prepared to reposition the brand at
each stage of the Scissors-Rock-Paper cycle.
