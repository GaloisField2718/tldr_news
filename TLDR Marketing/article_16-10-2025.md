(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Grocery prices are rising sharply, with coffee up 21% and ground beef

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EXPERIENTIAL TREND OF THE WEEK: HOTLINES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This year, hotlines are reemerging as a new tool in experiential
marketing. Canva invited fans to leave feedback through rotary phones,
while Disney and Doritos launched story-driven hotlines tied to major
entertainment properties. Biosil added a direct-to-consumer element
through celebrity-recorded responses tied to product benefits. These
campaigns leveraged customer curiosity and nostalgia while offering
them a new and different way to connect with brand narratives. 

 HOW TOP CREATORS USE SIGNATURE FORMATS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Top-performing creators in 2025 use signature formats that make their
content instantly recognizable. This strategy drives faster audience
growth, builds authority, and sustains consistency. From SEO carousels
to visual templates, high-growth creators are anchoring their strategy
around repeatable and actionable content structures. The RARE
(Recognizable, Actionable, Repeatable, and Engaging) framework
provides a simple roadmap to build a format that can become a content
trademark.

 NEW DATA STUDY: WHAT QUERIES IS CHATGPT USING BEHIND THE SCENES? (6
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ChatGPT performs searches to ground its responses about 31% of the
time, averaging 2.17 searches per prompt and 5.48 words per query. Its
queries are 61% longer than typical Google searches, with 77%
containing 5 or more words. ChatGPT's search use varies by industry,
peaking at 59% for local queries and dropping to 18% for credit card
content. Jobs and software topics trigger the highest number of
searches per prompt, averaging nearly 3 and 2.68 respectively. The
most common terms in ChatGPT's fan-out queries include “reviews,”
“2025,” “features,” and “comparison,” suggesting that
optimizing for these keywords may improve visibility in AI-driven
search.

 DEATH OF THE CREATOR (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Social media has moved from follower-based networks to
algorithm-driven “recommendation media”, and is now entering a
third phase powered by gen AI. In this new stage, platforms will
create personalized content on demand, reducing their reliance on
human creators. While people will still make things, incentives will
shift toward unique, human-only experiences like live events and
communities. Platforms may reward creators for feeding models rather
than reaching audiences. 

 THE CROCODILE MOUTH, THE DEATH OF NUM=100 & HOW TO CUT THROUGH THE
CHAOS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The "Crocodile Mouth" refers to the growing gap between impressions
and clicks in Google Search Console that surfaced in early 2025.
Brands saw impressions rise sharply while clicks stayed flat or
declined. The cause was twofold. First, AI Overviews and zero-click
search behaviors kept users on the search page. Second, the num=100
parameter, which previously allowed tools to track 100 search results
per query, inflated impression data. Cutting through all the noise
requires aligning content with how search is functioning now. This
includes visibility within AI surfaces, clarity in structure, and a
pivot toward transactional queries that still convert. 

 CAN AI REPLACE A CMO FOR CASH-STRAPPED STARTUPS? (3 MINUTE READ) [15]


 AI cannot replace a CMO in startups today. The role requires
strategy, leadership, and turning vision into action. Fractional CMOs
let startups combine part-time human insight with AI-driven execution.
In the future, CMOs will guide AI, ensure ethical use, and merge
machine insights with human judgment, showing that AI supports
leadership rather than replaces it.
