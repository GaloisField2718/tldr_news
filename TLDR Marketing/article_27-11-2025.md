NEWS & TRENDS

 THE ALPHA IS NOT LLM MONITORING (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The real value in AI search lies in Agentic SEO tools that produce
outcomes, not in LLM monitoring dashboards. Investors put $227 million
into AI visibility tracking, but established platforms captured $550
million, and Agentic SEO companies raised only $86 million despite
having far stronger operational moats. Most monitoring companies are
young and face negative switching costs, while Agentic SEO tools are
older, harder to replace, and power a brand's publishing engine. Many
monitoring companies are predicted to face down rounds, consolidation,
or failure by Q3 2026 because the category is already being
commoditized by free or bundled tools. 

 US RETAIL SALES ROSE LESS THAN FORECAST IN SEPTEMBER AS KEY DATA
RETURNS AFTER SHUTDOWN DELAYS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 US retail sales rose 0.2% in September, which missed the expected
0.4% and signaled a slowdown from the 0.6% gain in August. Consumers
appear resilient but more selective as major retailers reported
pressure on lower and middle-income households. Investors now estimate
an 85% chance of an interest rate cut in December after the weaker
retail and producer price data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 UPDATE THE PUBLISHING DATE ON OLD, HIGH-QUALITY ARTICLES (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Updating the publishing date on older high-quality articles can
quickly increase their visibility without rewrites, audits, or link
building. A 30-minute batch refresh can move 10-40% of articles from
low-ranking pages to page one because Google and LLMs favor freshness.
This tactic shows which content benefits from a quick update and which
requires deeper work. 

 WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO SEND EMAILS IN PR? (A STUDY OF 4.5M EMAILS)
(8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 8 to 9 AM local time is the most effective window for PR emails
because 36% of opens occur during that hour. Monday delivers the
strongest performance for both opens and replies across staff
journalists and freelancers. Freelancers show steadier engagement
during the week but still peak around 8 AM and drop on Friday. US
journalists engage most between 9 and 11 AM, and UK journalists peak
between 7 and 9 AM, but individual timing still depends on publication
and personalization.

 HOW AMAZON BUILT THE WORLD'S FASTEST GROWING AD BUSINESS (10 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Initially hesitant and disorganized, Amazon slowly invested in ad
infrastructure, leaned on relationships with product vendors, and
overcame internal conflicts between merchandising and sales. By
developing proprietary systems, integrating first-party shopper data,
and introducing full-funnel ad capabilities, it built a platform that
now generates over $56 billion in annual ad revenue. Key moves
included launching search ads, acquiring Twitch, expanding Fire TV,
and monetizing Prime Video. 

 VIDEO STREAMING SERVICES ARE REACHING THE LIMITS OF LOYALTY (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 UK streaming customers are cycling subscriptions at a much higher
rate, which makes loyalty harder to secure. The share of consumers who
cycle has reached 21% and 42% are open to it, while 55% of
subscriptions come through deals, and deal-driven users churn at a
rate of 73%. Netflix's subscriber share has dropped from 76% to 72%
and password sharing has risen from 6% to 8%. The research shows that
many Prime Video users would cancel if it were unbundled from Prime,
and those who would stay expect to pay £5 or less per month, which
highlights how fragile platform loyalty has become. 

 BEYOND THE ALGORITHM: WHY THE BEST MARKETING STILL COMES FROM HUMAN
INTUITION (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Naked Juice and KeVita, both under PepsiCo, took opposite marketing
approaches. Naked Juice spent heavily on measurable channels like
display ads and paid social but struggled to generate cultural
relevance. KeVita, with a smaller budget, relied on intuition to guide
less trackable efforts aligned with lifestyle and conversation. Its
campaign felt more alive and delivered better brand awareness and
long-term results. Intuition, built from experience, is a strategic
advantage when data alone cannot drive bold, brand-defining decisions.
