TLDR MARKETING 2025-12-09

 YOUR CEO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ENGAGEMENT. CONNECT MARKETING EFFORT TO
REVENUE WITH ASANA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Marketers everywhere are feeling the pressure: launch more campaigns,
ship them faster, do it all with fewer resources -- and prove that
you're actually moving the needle on revenue.

If you need a moment for a primal scream, that's understandable. But
here's the good news: There's a way to do more with less, and it's
Asana [4]. 

Asana is the work platform where human + AI collaboration comes
together [4], helping marketing teams mobilize around clear goals,
drive impact, and scale campaign workflows.

NEWS & TRENDS

 GEN Z DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR BRAND HERITAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Gen Z largely ignores traditional marketing. Brand prestige, polished
ads, and big launch events have little impact. They prefer serialized
content like “day 47 with this phone” over one-off campaigns. More
than 80% of their purchase discussions happen in private DMs and group
chats, so brands cannot track them. They trust creators more than
brands or legacy media, and that trust now carries into offline
meet-ups and hands-on events. 

 DIGITAL WALLET USE OUTPACES REGULATORS (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Digital wallets have become a primary payment tool as usage surges
and regulation lags. About 77% of Americans used a top wallet in the
past year, and global adoption is projected to hit 6B users by 2029.
Monthly mobile payments in the US jumped from 4 in 2018 to 11 last
year, showing a clear shift toward phone-based transactions.
Regulators are scrambling to adapt, creating tension between rapid
innovation, dense but uneven oversight, and growing consumer reliance
on wallet ecosystems.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LET'S TALK REENGAGEMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Re-engagement campaigns are a targeted fix for deliverability issues,
not an ongoing list-shrinking tactic. They help identify abandoned
inboxes, spam folder recipients, and true spam traps, which all show
little or no measurable activity. Engagement signals vary across
mailbox providers, and many users read email in untrackable ways, so
senders need to be clear about their goals and selective about who
enters a re-engagement flow. The priority is removing risky addresses
rather than penalizing real subscribers who appear inactive due to
image blocking or limited tracking. Re-engagement should only run when
there is a concrete deliverability problem, since it always removes
some legitimate users. 

 WHY BLOGGING WILL BE HUGE IN 2026 (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Blogging remains a powerful tool because AI relies on human expertise
and credible content. Generic SEO content has lost trust, creating
opportunities for practitioner-led blogs that drive direct search
traffic and support broader business ecosystems. Strong blogs share
real experiences and lessons, build an audience before publishing, and
repurpose content across multiple platforms. Monetization comes
through consulting, courses, software, and communities rather than
display ads. The goal is to become a trusted destination that
audiences actively seek out by name.

 NOTES ON GOOGLE ADS NEW STRATEGY TOOL (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Investment Strategy in Google Ads gives advertisers a fast way to see
the 7-day performance impact of budget changes across all campaigns in
one view. It centralizes projections at the account level and shows
how removing budget limits could affect conversions, conversion value,
or clicks. It is useful for short term periods such as Cyber Week,
while Performance Planner remains better for longer planning horizons
of up to one year. It still lacks fields for tCPA and tROAS, so
advertisers should review its recommendations carefully and monitor
outcomes. 

 INTRODUCING SOCIAL CHANNELS IN SEARCH CONSOLE (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google is testing a new Search Console feature that gives site owners
a unified view of Search performance for both their websites and
connected social channels. The update expands Search Console Insights
to show clicks, impressions, top pages, top queries, and audience
locations for supported social channels. It also surfaces additional
traffic sources such as Image Search, Video Search, News Search, and
Discover. The feature is available only to a limited group of sites
that Search Console identifies automatically. 

 INSTAGRAM IS TESTING A NEW FEATURE THAT LETS CREATORS SHARE EARLY
ACCESS TO THEIR REELS WITH FOLLOWERS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A new feature in testing, Early Access Reels, lets creators restrict
content to followers for 24 hours. Non-followers see a teaser with a
countdown and a prompt to follow. This model incentivizes immediate
engagement and builds loyalty by giving followers first-look
privileges. Unlike Trial Reels, which exposed content to wider
audiences first, Early Access rewards community-building and
exclusivity.

 HOW DO PEOPLE USE AI ASSISTANTS? (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Most AI sessions are short and transactional. The median conversation
has 2 turns, and over 80% of sessions stay under 1,000 words.
Assistants generate about 60% of all content and produce roughly 1.5x
more words than users. Only 35% of sessions show any commercial
intent, and the largest share of those are early awareness (10%),
while 65% of all sessions fall outside the commercial funnel and focus
on tasks like brainstorming (7.7%) and planning (6.5%). A small group
of long and complex sessions over 2,500 words accounts for only 4.2%
of the total but represents the highest value use cases. 

 WHY THE FUTURE OF MARKETING BELONGS TO CREATIVES WHO THINK LIKE
CODERS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Campaigns today operate as adaptive systems rather than single static
ideas. AI has turned every consumer interaction into a dynamic input.
The most effective creative professionals now approach campaign
building with a developer mindset. They test, release, and improve
quickly. This means replacing the traditional push for perfection with
fast iteration and structured learning. Coders break and rebuild
continuously, a behavior now essential for campaign success.
