 IS AI GOING TO STEAL YOUR JOB? (SPONSOR) [8] 

 For dev marketers, probably not. This LinkedIn post by TLDR's founder
explains how AI is great for automating the tedious tasks, but it will
never replace the human touch needed to build trust with the developer
audience. Follow Dan on LinkedIn [9] if you're interested in how TLDR

 LEVERAGE BOTH A STATIC IMAGE AND VIDEO IN ONE META AD (1 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Meta's ad algorithm tends to favor static ads. To combine both static
images and videos in one Meta ad, start by using an image as your
primary format. Customize video-first placements, such as Reels and
Stories, by replacing the creative with a 9x16 video. This ensures
that static ads will appear in most placements, while video versions
will be shown where viewers expect videos. This setup allows you to
optimize for both formats without creating multiple ads. 

 HOLIDAY PROMOTIONS IN GOOGLE TEXT ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A little-known feature in Google Ads text versions can highlight
promotions, helping advertisers showcase deals this holiday season.
Add a Headline or Description at the account- or campaign-level, then
pin them to show only in positions one, two, or three. You can also
set promotion assets (formerly ‚Äúpromotion extensions‚Äù) at the
account-, campaign-, or ad group-level, which allow an extra line of
text for a monetary or percentage discount.

 THREE REVOLUTIONS ARE CONVERGING BUT ONLY GOOD MARKETERS WILL BENEFIT
(6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 3 converging revolutions ‚Äî B2B marketing, the Ehrenberg-Bass (EBI)
approach, and AI ‚Äî will shape the future of marketing. B2B is now
recognized as a major economic force, with faster growth than
traditional B2C. The EBI revolution emphasizes mental market share
